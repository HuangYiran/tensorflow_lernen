2
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,962
This door?

3
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,840
This box or that box?

4
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,161
Are they all for me?

5
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,162
Cool. Thanks!

6
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,764
Hey, where are you going?
Hey, what are you doing?

7
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,248
Hey, open the door
Hey! What's going on?

8
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,289
There is nothing, no name, no face

9
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,209
I was born into nothingness,

10
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,891
you could say I don't exist.

11
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,522
Daddy, look what I can do!

12
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,488
Very Good!

13
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,731
Hi!

14
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,206
Hallo!

15
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,650
Could you help me?
I lost my goggles

16
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,042
Dad, look.

17
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,008
Great.

18
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,889
They are down there in the deep wateg
but I can't dive that deep.

19
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,121
Dad, you are not looking.

20
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,605
Of course I am.

21
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,989
- Would you help me?  - Yeah sure.

22
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,289
Lotte, wait here in the shallow wateg
I'll be right back.

23
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,886
So, where are your goggles?

24
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,007
Down there.

25
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,962
There you go.

26
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,603
Thanks!

27
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,044
No problem!

28
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,601
Would you go on the slide with me.
I get scared on my own.

29
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,209
No way.

30
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,169
Or we could play 'animal jumping',

31
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,847
I'll jump into the water and pretend to be an animal
and you have to guess what I am.

32
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,962
I am here with my daughter.

33
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,002
Your daughter sucks at doing the handstand.

34
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,614
She can't do it at all!

35
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,085
What are you talking about?

36
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,489
What the..., Hey, stop this bullshit!
Leave my daughter alone!

37
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,129
Lotte, come on... let's get something to drink.

38
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,003
Asshole!

39
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,963
Mrs. Heine?

40
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,726
I am one of Nicolas's friends.
We play soccer together

41
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,200
Nicolas isn't home.

42
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,400
I know... but I borrowed him my knee guards,

43
00:07:17,402 --> 00:07:19,721
and just wanted to ask, if I could get them back.

44
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,490
I need them for tomorrow's game.
Otherwise, I won't be allowed to play.

45
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,006
Come in,

46
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,166
but please take off your shoes.

47
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,004
I have an appointment with detective Becker or Egger.

48
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,841
Decker chief superintendent Decker.

49
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,271
You are standing on my foot.

50
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,068
Oh, I am sorry.

51
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,605
Give me your umbrella!

52
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,184
And get me some rubber boots.

53
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,405
Do you have any idea of when Nicolas will be back?

54
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,450
Our team would collect some money,in order to help out.

55
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,322
That's very kind,
but I'am afraid ransom won't help.

56
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,565
The knee guards,they must be in the cupboard, somewhere.

57
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,281
I didn't know that Nicolas is still
playing with dolls.

58
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,288
Not Friedolin, the rabbit, please don't touch him!

59
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,324
Hello, I'm Friedolin.
I am cold and I am all alone.

60
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,451
Put him back! Put him back!

61
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,801
Do you know, who I am?

62
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,740
I think, it's time for you to leave.

63
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,551
Mrs. Meinert?

64
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,087
Decker, we talked on the phone.

65
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,082
Or shoud I say doctor Meinert.

66
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,382
Meinert is fine.

67
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,167
Thank's for coming down so quickly.

68
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,270
I think we can save the compliments.

69
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,848
If I understood correctly, we are pushed for time.

70
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,228
Who was that?

71
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,823
Nobody.

72
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:40,462
The boy was last seen when leaving
school after his sixth lesson.

73
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,791
He never arrived at home.
We are still searching his way to school.

74
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,426
Do you know what mouldy sandwiches,
like them ones mean?

75
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,380
This syndrome is almost exclusively found in boys.

76
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,104
They don't want to eat their sandwich,
but they are unable to throw it away.

77
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,942
So the sandwiches start moulding...
just like a bad conscience.

78
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,664
Do you have kids, Mrs Meinert?

79
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,384
I don't get along with kids.

80
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,441
Good afternoon ladies and gentleman,
may I see you tickets please?

81
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,680
Are you also travelling without a ticket?

82
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,649
May I?

83
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,563
I don't mind if you need to piss,
unless you need to go for a shit,

84
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,081
that would be pretty uncool.

85
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,651
Did that hurt?

86
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,006
Are you pretending to be on an 'emo trip'?
Because I am talking too much, or what?

87
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,762
You look propper gay.
But you have nice eyes.

88
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,086
I need to get out of here.

89
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,282
Cute.

90
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,762
Pussy.

91
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,202
What are you doing there?

92
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,087
Oh, I am sorry...
I was just thinking.

93
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,563
Don't worry I'll take care of that!

94
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,846
Maybe you could help me.
I am looking for something personal from your son.

95
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,169
Something that was important to him.

96
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,487
The football.

97
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,689
Do you have something more personal.

98
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,964
It's signed by all players.

99
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,449
What about this rabbit?

100
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,721
Lost

101
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,000
Please take off your shoes inside the house

102
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,022
Mum?

103
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,522
Mum!

104
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,407
Get up! Come on, get up!

105
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,067
Mathilda, why aren't you at school?

106
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,000
It's half past seven.

107
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,684
Did you smoke?

108
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,760
Come on, get up.

109
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,991
It's all right mum.

110
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,091
I don't want to.

111
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,910
But I don't want to.

112
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,622
But you have to.

113
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,286
The water is cold.

114
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,849
Look, I made it warmer

115
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,930
But it's still cold.

116
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,721
I made some Spaghetti for you,
you like eating them, don't you?

117
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,291
I saw it, thanks.

118
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,782
I am sick.

119
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,044
Mama you have to take a shower

120
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,086
The water is cold.

121
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,686
But I just made it warmer.

122
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,967
But it's still cold.

123
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,400
Mum, you smell of piss.

124
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,969
How are you talking to me?!

125
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,882
You shouldn't talk in this way
with your mother.

126
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,996
I am your mum.

127
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,627
I am sorry.

128
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,549
The water is cold.

129
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,000
I made it warmer

130
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,522
AUAAAAA. IT'S BOILING!

131
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,930
How was school?

132
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,031
Your mother asked you something.

133
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,682
Would you please turn of the TV
At least, as long as we're having dinner.

134
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,808
TV: Somewhere out there,
there is someone who knows where our son is.

135
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,689
We beg you, don't hurt our child.

136
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,923
Did you hear what your mother said?

137
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,851
We do whatever you want,
but please give us a sign of life.

138
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,085
Show us that our son is all right.

139
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,807
Nicolas is a good boy...

140
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,568
he loves playing football and he is very popular with his friends.

141
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:44,768
Nicolas loves his rabbits
and cares about them attentively.

142
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,283
I am sorry, I can't do this.

143
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:07,902
Hello?

144
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,806
Hello?

145
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,329
Hello. Is anybody there?

146
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,406
Hello. Is anybody there?

147
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,486
Don't go away. Hey!

148
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,789
Mrs. Meinert?

149
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,703
I have a message for you.

150
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,523
Please give a call! Max

151
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,483
If this gentleman calls again,
tell him that I've left.

152
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,329
Thank you!

153
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,745
Yes?

154
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,843
Hello Mrs Meinert, it's me.
We have a sign of life.

155
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,764
The mating dance of the humpback
wales can last for many hours

156
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,087
and is often accompanied by complex signing.

157
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,171
In order to mate, the wales swim tightly
along side one another

158
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,647
mainly upright, while their bellies
are touching and they nibble

159
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,530
on each others mouth.

160
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,169
Mathilda, would you come to the front please?

161
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,767
Mathilda!

162
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,961
Please explain, how mammal fertilisation works.

163
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,207
And take your hair out of your mouth, please!

164
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,920
Where does the fertilisation take place?

165
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,891
In the cunt.

166
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,650
We found the video on many of our student's mobiles.

167
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,527
It's like approaching dogs.
Just don't show them that you are scared.

168
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,802
That's my seat.

169
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,722
Hi!

170
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,849
Hello!

171
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,007
Thank you.

172
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,570
First of all, I am asking you all to turn off your mobile phones.

173
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,745
If I hear one of them ring,
I am going to collect them all.

174
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,522
Well, this is Mrs. Meinert from the police.

175
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,270
She would like to ask you a few questions.

176
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,804
Which one of you has seen the video of Nicolas.

177
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,126
Louder!

178
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,442
Which one of you has seen the video of Nicolas,
the boy in the cellar

179
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,051
No one will get into trouble if they have seen it.
I watched it myself.

180
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,687
I watched it. A friend sent it to me.

181
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,689
And what did you think, when you saw it?

182
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,210
The bunny was cute.

183
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,769
I, I also watched the video,
I thought it was horrorifying.

184
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,922
I thought, it was funny.

185
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,009
That is not funny.

186
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,129
It clapped when he fell.

187
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,729
I want to see the victim.

188
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,606
Who else has seen the video?

189
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,409
Is it real?

190
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,487
Yes, the video is real.

191
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,530
We are going to have one-on-one interviews
with all of you now.

192
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,087
Please let your parents know that
you are going to be late.

193
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,724
I want to see the victim,
and I want an ice-cream.

194
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,888
Mrs. Schockenhoff.
Mrs. SCHOCKENHOOOFFFF!!!

195
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,407
Yes, please.

196
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,607
Wait for me after school.

197
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,931
I need to pee.

198
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,489
Name and grade, please!

199
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,602
Nine B.

200
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,362
Name?

201
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,289
I don't have a name.

202
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,122
Everybody has a name.

203
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,242
Not me.

204
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,325
Don't you like your name?

205
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,403
Your name is Claudia Meinert, right.

206
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,402
Yea.

207
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,569
Do you have a second name?

208
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,482
Hanne, Hannelore. And you?

209
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,810
Did your father used to call you like that?
Hanne?

210
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,084
Why don't you just pick a name,
one that you like?

211
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,888
You don't choose names, names are given to you.

212
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,125
Parents give their children names.

213
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,289
It says here, your name is

214
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,404
I don't have a name.

215
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:10,764
Well, did you know the boy from the video?

216
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,769
We play in the same club.

217
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,409
And did you ever fight with him.

218
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,328
He is very popular

219
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,206
I asked you,if you ever had a fight with him.

220
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,049
Do you know anybody who has had a fight with him.

221
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,364
Like I said, he is very popular.

222
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,689
Maybe a bit too popular

223
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,000
It's says here that you are highly talented,
you skipped the seventh grade.

224
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,362
It's not easy?

225
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,447
What?

226
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,289
Making friends.

227
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,250
I have other interests.

228
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,562
For example?

229
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,967
Girls, fashion, music.
May I go now?

230
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,685
And where exactly is your victim supposed to be?

231
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,283
Hey, what is this shit?

232
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,285
Switch the lights back on!

233
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,041
Hello?

234
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,889
I am here.

235
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,482
Switch the lights on immediately!

236
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,568
I am right behind you.

237
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,329
Is the victim in here too?

238
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,642
Yes.

239
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,089
When are you going to make it happen?

240
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,850
Kill the victim?

241
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,003
I have a special plan with him beforehand.

242
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,922
What's that?

243
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,727
He is going to be my birthday present.

244
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,329
I want to watch, when you do it.

245
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,329
I want to be there, when you do it.

246
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,207
I want to watch, when somebody is dying.

247
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,691
Mrs. Schweizer?

248
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,691
My name is Claudia Meinert.

249
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,085
Did something happen to my husband?

250
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,521
Your husband is fine.

251
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,969
I have a few questions regarding your son.

252
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,090
I imagined him to be much taller.

253
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,371
Come over here!

254
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,645
What's the matter?

255
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,141
You wanted to see him.
Now you saw him.

256
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,449
I thought we were going do something together today.

257
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,721
Also, I still want my ice cream.

258
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,804
You will get your ice cream.

259
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,322
Asshole.

260
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,765
Give me your watch!

261
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,926
I asked you to give me your watch!

262
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,248
YOUR WATCH!!!

263
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,809
May try yours?

264
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,370
Tomorrow is fun fair
I want you to take me there.

265
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,729
No time.

266
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,604
Else, I will tell everybody where your victim is.

267
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,442
If you do that?

268
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,802
What then?

269
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,530
Then you'll never see someone dying.

270
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,403
I bet, you don't dare to do it anyway.

271
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,249
Tomorrow at five at the crawler.

272
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,781
Is that a date.

273
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,882
Cool.

274
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,326
See you tomorrow.

275
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,286
Come on you have to eat something.

276
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,964
I am not hungry.

277
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,963
Shall I make you a salad.

278
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,088
I don't understand how you can eat at all.

279
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,574
Are you Nicolas Dad?

280
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:53,095
I promised Nicolas to feed his rabbits
while he is away.

281
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,013
Moritz, Finny, Schnuffy and Carl.

282
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,694
When did you talk to Nicolas?

283
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,733
May I come in?

284
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,572
Sure, come in.

285
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,296
Weren't you here yesterday?

286
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,735
What do you want?

287
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,733
He claims that he spoke to Nicolas.

288
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:39,010
Oh, did I interrupt your dinner?
Should I come back later?

289
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,171
When exactly did you talk to Nicolas?

290
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,371
May I have something to drink?

291
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,534
Milk, if you have any.

292
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,956
That is Nicolas seat.

293
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:15,577
Please explain us in detail,
when exactly you spoke to Nicolas.

294
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,738
Would you make me a sandwich?

295
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,779
Out! OUT!

296
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:41,695
Anja, wait! Wait!

297
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,219
Oh, I am sorry.

298
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,331
It's late, my parents are
waiting for me with dinner.

299
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,215
Where did you get this watch?

300
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,050
I want her to make me a sandwiche, with salami.

301
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,894
And now, you are going to tell me
where you got this damn watch from!

302
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,561
I want her to make it!

303
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,856
I know it's late, but...

304
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,576
My wife is already asleep.
Maybe it's better you come back tomorrow.

305
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,541
I just wanted to ask if you know this boy.

306
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,500
No!

307
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:47,055
Five minutes. Give me five minutes.

308
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,936
After that, you can do anything you want with me.

309
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:55,773
He said, he knows where Nicolas is.
He's got his watch.

310
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:03,374
Open this door immediately.
Open the doog right now! RIGHT NOW!

311
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,577
Morning.

312
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,492
Morning.

313
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,213
I have a new boyfriend.

314
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,576
Didn 't you want to buy milk?

315
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,771
I think, I am in love.

316
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:37,059
We want to go to the fair tonight.
Do you have any money?

317
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,519
You know how it works?

318
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,580
I would be a shit grandma, you know that.

319
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,257
Thank you.

320
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:35,973
I am expecting company tonight,
would be cool, if you could stay in your room.

321
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,737
Yeah!

322
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,576
I am a child, I am incapable of crime,
whatever I do.

323
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,455
I know the law.

324
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,254
So, I can go now?

325
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,332
This says, your birthday is in three days.

326
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:10,573
You will turn fourteen and that means
you will no longer be freed of crime.

327
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,913
In three days, Nicolas is dead.

328
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,939
I am tired, may I go now?

329
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,936
We can't do anything, he knows that.

330
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,580
We will claim charge against the father.

331
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,690
Bring the boy home!
Clarify if the parents comply their fiduciary duty.

332
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:45,094
We will be observing him, day and night.

333
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:47,758
What the fuck.

334
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,892
Our Hanne is pregnant.

335
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,735
Give it back!

336
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:57,054
Did you already know, our Hanne is pregnant?

337
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,859
That's enough!

338
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,891
Do you already have name for the little one?

339
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,452
Or is it going to be a little girl,
a little Hanne?

340
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:30,339
Will you ride the crawler with me?

341
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:35,540
Just one time... I get scared on my own.

342
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,417
I am here with my children.

343
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,254
Otherwise, I am going to tell my mother
that you touched me.

344
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,093
I did what?

345
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:46,776
You touched my tits.

346
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,978
Are you nuts?

347
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,418
Just one round. One little bitty round.

348
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,579
Get off!

349
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:12,812
Asshole.

350
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:26,290
Sabine Meissner Seventy, four years of age,
she fell in her apartment,

351
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:30,254
three weeks later the neighbours complained about the smell.

352
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:44,655
Blistering on the lips,
mucosal skin dried out and lacerated,

353
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:46,655
the tonsils inflamed.

354
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
That's how somebody looks, who died of thirst.

355
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,337
I know it from the TV

356
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:04,074
Well then, touch hen

357
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:09,300
It's just a dead body.

358
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,939
Feels like a cold apple, and now?

359
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:26,890
If Nicolas dies, he will feel the same.

360
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:32,018
And you will feel guilty for your entire life,
because you were unable to save him.

361
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:10,096
His grades are good,
we have no problems with him.

362
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:15,297
He is one of the best students in his year,
at least in written work.

363
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:22,860
I think, you didn't really get my point.
Your son committed a serious crime.

364
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:28,937
Are you sure,
I mean do you have any evidence?

365
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:32,179
He confessed.

366
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,939
Do you mind if I smoke?

367
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,819
Not in the house, Cora please!

368
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,853
Has your son changed at all recently?

369
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,531
How were we supposed to?
He barely even speaks to us.

370
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,614
That's a change, don't you think?

371
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:12,939
We thought, it's the age.

372
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:22,091
Your son no longer answers to his name.
I think that's not normal, don't you?

373
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:26,012
Sammy, would you please hand me my coat?

374
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:43,053
I am sorry,could you please repeat your question?

375
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:47,061
If your son doesn't answer to his own name,
to what does he answer then?

376
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,896
Nothing. Just: Hey you.

377
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:54,574
Do you remember any triggeg a fight maybe?

378
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:00,371
He just stopped talking to us.

379
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:03,375
It got worse last year

380
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,699
He used to work things out by himself.

381
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:07,614
As I said, it got worse last year.

382
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,734
I can't force my child to talk to me.

383
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,381
But you try it over and over again.

384
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:14,892
Yes, unlike you, I try to talk to my son,
that's right.

385
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:20,496
Do you still have physical contact with your son?

386
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:24,490
Touching, hugs, cuddles...

387
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:27,974
He is thirteen.
I don't get your question.

388
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,252
If I understand you right,

389
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:34,091
your son has been socially completely isolated
for more than one year now.

390
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:36,976
That's right you could say that.

391
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:39,772
No, that's not right.
Only recently he completed an internship

392
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:42,740
a student internship in the youth well-fare office.

393
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:46,019
That's kind of social, isn't it.

394
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:52,934
Does that mean it's all my fault?

395
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:56,016
This isn't about fault.

396
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:58,099
What then?

397
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:03,256
I think, you are hiding something from me.

398
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:27,260
Nicolas?

399
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:35,535
What do you want from me?

400
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:10,936
Will this be one of this: Show me your room
and I will tell you who you are thing?

401
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,081
My self perception is disturbed.

402
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:22,412
Would you please wait outside?

403
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:08,000
Nietzsche said: We do not accuse nature of being
immoral if it sends us a thunderstorm.

404
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:15,316
Why do we call a human being immoral if he kills.
No one is born evil.

405
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,999
So, it's society's fault or that of the parents?

406
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,815
May I have one too?

407
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,579
Nice lighten

408
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:41,293
I had it since I was twelve, pure brass,
you won't find this anymore today.

409
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:43,213
May I?

410
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:44,170
You're welcome!

411
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:48,014
Did your father give it to you?

412
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,856
No, I just found in somewhere,
and never lost it since.

413
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,459
Look at the lighter!

414
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:01,410
I just want to answer your question.

415
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:08,877
Until now, I am nobody, just someone
that you have barely known for three days.

416
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:11,818
Look at the lighter!

417
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:27,211
Now I am the one who broke your lighten

418
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:33,938
That has been my favourite lighter
for over forty years.

419
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:38,491
The more it hurts you, the deeper our relationship.

420
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:41,736
You want to have a relationship with me,
and therefore you brake my lighter?

421
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,076
If this is the only way to get in contact with you.

422
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:49,460
Now you will never forget me.

423
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:51,573
No, this I'll never forget.

424
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:56,541
And that is his motive,
he want's a relationship with her at any cost.

425
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:00,077
If you would be a guy, I would smack you for that.

426
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,820
I will buy you a new one.

427
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,700
I also know a Nietzsche saying...

428
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:11,172
The one who fights with monsters needs to be careful

429
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:14,011
that he doesn't turn into a monster himself.

430
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,254
Like I said, I'll get you an new one.

431
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,571
May I ask you a personal question?

432
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,659
Maybe another time.

433
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:44,179
Fucking cold today.

434
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,060
Coffee would be good.

435
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:56,813
I'll go and check what's going on.

436
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:11,052
Nicolas.

437
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:54,820
Oh shit.

438
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:00,576
Come I'll clean you.

439
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:09,617
You know, that happened to me once, too

440
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:12,541
I woke up becausel had to pee so badly.

441
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:14,412
And then?

442
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:17,759
I pissed the whole bed.

443
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:20,936
The next day it stank like.

444
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:23,058
Like a pissed tramp.

445
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:27,852
Right, like a fully pissed tramp.

446
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:33,617
Come, we'll get you fresh clothes.

447
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:59,770
Advertisement for telephone sex.

448
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:49,853
Our people are on it.
For now we can only wait.

449
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:52,240
Anything new about the cellar?

450
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:56,201
A cellar without any windows,
every second cellar in town looks like this.

451
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,139
Anything wrong?

452
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:22,097
No.

453
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:24,213
You looked at me strangely.

454
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:25,933
I didn't look at you.

455
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:28,261
Sure, you looked at me strangely.

456
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:32,655
Here, some new games this is even adult rated.

457
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:34,173
I want to go home.

458
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:40,000
You can go home again,
when your mother does what I say.

459
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:04,151
Where were you?  We had a date?

460
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:05,652
No time.

461
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,612
But for the victim you have time, or what?

462
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:10,800
His name is Nicolas.

463
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,414
You are bleeding.

464
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,019
You are crazy, you know that?

465
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:26,100
Like I said, we are a perfect match.

466
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:29,780
Can I crash at your place tonight?

467
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:30,737
No time.

468
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:34,032
Isn't that the cop chick from school?

469
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,094
Do you want to go swimming?

470
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:42,972
Yes.

471
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:48,477
Will you slide with me, I am scared alone.

472
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:57,614
Faster! Come on, faster!

473
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:05,219
I want an ice-cream.

474
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:18,859
We have to talk.

475
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:20,573
Thanks.

476
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:22,692
Anja.

477
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:34,579
Thank you.

478
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:37,452
Thanks.

479
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:52,810
Can you put some lotion on my back?

480
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,499
Also under the bikini!

481
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:55,537
Mathilda, what do want to have for dinner?

482
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:59,259
What's your favourite dish?

483
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:07,000
Spaghetti Bolognese.
But real Bolognese, not the canned stuff.

484
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:09,453
Can you make that?

485
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:12,892
Yes.

486
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:46,093
HELLO! HELP! HELP!

487
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:48,975
HELLO! Is there anybody out there?

488
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:52,372
HELLO! HELP! HELP!

489
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:06,217
That's really yummy.
Are you not hungry?

490
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:10,099
We eat all together!

491
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:12,013
I am not hungry.

492
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,699
I want you to eat.

493
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:59,053
You still have to ask how school was.

494
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:00,973
How was school?

495
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:01,937
Good.

496
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:03,852
Good.

497
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:39,781
We are eating!

498
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:53,233
These are the best Spaghetti ever
May I have some more?

499
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:12,819
What is this about?

500
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,859
I am hungry

501
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:18,739
But you are not invited.

502
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:21,131
Either I get some of your Spaghetti...

503
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:24,015
or I will tell the others
what yummy meal you have here.

504
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:26,417
Which others?

505
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:35,054
Would you hand me the sauce, please?

506
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:50,971
I talked to you parents.
They want you to come home after dinner.

507
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:53,138
I stay here for the night.

508
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:57,797
We stay here for the night.
There are pigs outside everywhere.

509
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:01,009
You are under age, that's the law.

510
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:04,010
Unless we all stay here for the night.

511
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:05,777
The sauce. Please!

512
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:25,531
Mathilda Herwick, mother on welfare,
single parent, alcohol.

513
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:27,853
Father?

514
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:32,418
Died, car accident,
when the kid was three.

515
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:35,538
Did he say what he wants?

516
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:40,338
The deal is: The police retreats in return
I will stay in the house.

517
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:42,053
That's a shit deal.

518
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:51,460
He is going to bring it to an end
as long as he is incapable of crime.

519
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:54,097
Nicolas has twenty eight hours left.

520
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:03,378
That's a beautiful pattern.

521
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:10,093
Japanese cherry blossom,
the wedding gift of my parents, in law.

522
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:13,536
Where shall I put it?

523
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:16,454
There inside the cupboard.

524
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:24,292
How long for have you known your husband?

525
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:28,734
We married when I was pregnant with Nicolas.

526
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:32,780
And before Raphael,was there any one else in your life.

527
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:41,037
I want to feed the rabbits, they are hungry too.

528
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:43,700
There.

529
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:54,614
You didn't answer my question.

530
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:59,980
I guess, that's none of your business.

531
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:05,835
There is a mistake.
Fiftysix divided by eight is seven not six.

532
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:10,580
Fiftysix divided by eight is seven not six.

533
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:26,850
No, the eight isn't wrong,
the six is.

534
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:35,671
Fortyeight divided by eight is six.
Two times six is?

535
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:37,452
Six.

536
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:40,339
Six times two is twelve.

537
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:43,219
Three times four is?

538
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:47,976
Three times four
Three times four is?

539
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:49,892
Six.

540
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:55,696
Six times two is twelve.
Three times four is?

541
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:56,657
Six

542
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:58,573
Not six, twelve!

543
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:06,210
Six, six, six

544
01:10:06,212 --> 01:10:07,392
sex

545
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:10,600
Twelve, six times two is twelve.

546
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:18,734
Six, point six six six.

547
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:22,412
Sex.

548
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:34,094
Shall we play something?

549
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:47,570
When I was a kid I had a rabbit too,
his name was Franz.

550
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:49,659
A birthday present from may father

551
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:59,919
Franz grew and grew, grew and grew,
only at Christmas Franz got very small again.

552
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:07,699
My father said, Franz becomes small,
so that he freezes less.

553
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:16,310
And I believed him. Until I understood
that every I ate Franz every christmas.

554
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:20,174
The story is made up right?

555
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,571
Does she knows who you are?

556
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:31,700
I know who you are.

557
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:34,581
The game is called: Who am I.

558
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:35,532
The game sucks.

559
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:37,254
You don't need to play along.

560
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:39,174
I want to be Lady Gaga.

561
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:41,133
The game is different.

562
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:44,874
The person to your left decides who you are
and he or she writes it on a piece of paper

563
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:47,978
and then stick it onto your forehead.

564
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:50,296
I am sorry but I can't do that.

565
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:52,055
Everyone will play along.

566
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:54,577
Please stay here.

567
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:03,000
You can only ask questions that can be
answered with yes or no.

568
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:25,421
CUNT

569
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,839
His, I don't get it.

570
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:34,092
Sorry, but...

571
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:37,296
You start, you have to ask who you are!

572
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:44,659
Am I evil?

573
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:46,573
Good question.

574
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:53,341
Someone did evil to you but you also performed
evil by yourself, yes you are evil.

575
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:55,019
Am I sexy.

576
01:12:55,690 --> 01:12:58,211
It's not your turn until he gets a no.

577
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:06,136
Have I killed Nicolas.

578
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:09,179
Do you want some more juice?

579
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:16,957
No, you haven't killed Nikolas.

580
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,139
Now it's Anjas turn.

581
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:24,900
Mrs. Heine it's your turn.

582
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:30,769
Am I female?

583
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:31,692
For sure.

584
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:32,657
That's insane.

585
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:37,452
"There was an old spinster 0f street.
Who bellowed, My cunt is on fire!"

586
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:41,736
So a fireman was found, brought his engine around,
and extinguished her burning desire.

587
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:55,693
Where is my son?

588
01:13:55,770 --> 01:14:01,459
Nicolas was so scared, he peed himself.
He screamed mummy, mummy

589
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:04,091
but he never said anything about daddy.

590
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:16,979
Stay, please!

591
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,816
Do you want to know who you are?

592
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:24,500
I thought it's my turn?

593
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:25,975
I give you a hint.

594
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,432
I want to ask something, too!

595
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:31,000
Your parents wanted to tell you,
when you are old enough to understand.

596
01:14:31,001 --> 01:14:33,292
But then you found your adoption certificate.

597
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:37,892
By accident or did you search for it.

598
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:41,269
Did you sense that they are not your real parents?

599
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,659
Am I sexy?

600
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:49,530
You are an anonymous birth.
Your biological parents are unknown.

601
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,179
This game sucks.

602
01:14:57,170 --> 01:14:59,170
How does it fell

603
01:15:00,999 --> 01:15:03,921
when you don't know who you are,
and where you come from?

604
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:07,000
When our own mother doesn't want you?

605
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:13,489
Then he felt very bashful,
and tucked his head under his wing.

606
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:17,000
He did not know what this was all about.

607
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:23,019
He felt so very happy, but he wasn't at all proud,
for a good heart never grows proud.

608
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:27,814
He thought about how he had been
persecuted and scorned,

609
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:33,016
and now he heard them all call him
the most beautiful of all beautiful birds.

610
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:37,818
The lilacs dipped their clusters
into the stream before him,

611
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:41,298
and the sun shone so warm and so heartening.

612
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:46,098
He rustled his feathers and held his slender neck high,

613
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:48,577
as he cried out with full heart:

614
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:55,695
"I never dreamed there could be so much happiness,
when I was the ugly duckling."

615
01:15:57,050 --> 01:15:58,939
Beautiful ending.

616
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:05,794
You forgot the good night kiss.

617
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:33,309
The boy was handed in by an unknown person
in the baby flap of the children's hospital Albert Sabin.

618
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:39,108
The Infant was hypothermic and regarding
the umbilical cord at least 24 hours old.

619
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:45,452
He was treated medically and at the end of an eight,
week period given up for adoption.

620
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:51,373
The infant was 24 hours old, that means his birthday is
tomorrow not the day after

621
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:56,172
With Foundlings, the handover date is classified
as the official date of birth.

622
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:59,379
The real date is known solely by the mother

623
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:01,652
Who gave the child his name?

624
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:03,101
The adoptive parents.

625
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:06,737
Until then the infant remained nameless.
In the provisional certificate of birth,

626
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:10,571
is an X instead of the name.

627
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:16,894
I didn't know you are a bastard.

628
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:38,836
Promise, that you never stand me up again,
like the funfair Will you promise me that?

629
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:07,219
Are you Gay?

630
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:13,899
Don't you like me?

631
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:18,733
Your tits are too small.

632
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:26,412
Asshole.

633
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:32,777
Is it possible to find out,
who the mother of the child is?

634
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:35,461
With baby flaps, no chance,
everything is anonymous.

635
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:39,991
But six months late; a young women appears in the

636
01:18:39,999 --> 01:18:43,572
youth welfare office and claims
to be the mother of the child.

637
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:45,653
She wanted her child back,

638
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:47,990
but the adoption was already completed.

639
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,420
Did she try to contact her child?

640
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:56,977
She did, but the adoptive parents refused it.
Her name was included in the documents,

641
01:18:56,990 --> 01:19:02,896
nothing else could be done for hen
Her maiden name was Anja Wehling.

642
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,012
Today she is called Heine.

643
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:09,616
Hello Claudia, are you still there?

644
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:13,000
He did an internship in the youth wellfare office.

645
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:36,939
Leave me alone！

646
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:46,000
You and your wife,
how did you get to know one other

647
01:20:47,570 --> 01:20:52,337
At the university cafeteria ,
she didn't like her meal, I gave her mine.

648
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:56,690
You did not know anything about this?

649
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:03,817
Five days ago,
we were just a normal family.

650
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:17,174
Why didn't tell me about this!

651
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:36,490
You lied to me! 12 years!

652
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:48,000
I'm your husband!
It's all about OUR child.

653
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:09,020
There's no sense...talk to me now!

654
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:11,013
What do you want?

655
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:14,851
I want to sleep in bed with mummy.

656
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:24,932
Shit.

657
01:23:35,930 --> 01:23:37,455
I can't sleep.

658
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:55,135
Nobody has ever read to me.

659
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:11,899
I heard about your father
My father died when I was al little kid, too.

660
01:24:17,690 --> 01:24:22,015
You can save your psycho stuff.
I don't know where the victim is.

661
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:23,017
Morning.

662
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:39,379
You look totally gay.

663
01:25:53,770 --> 01:25:58,571
And you have no clue
how to do it properly.

664
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,379
One line here.

665
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:10,939
But not too strong,
your lashes are already quite dark.

666
01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:17,739
And now this.

667
01:26:33,370 --> 01:26:35,259
What's going on here?

668
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:38,039
I don't know.

669
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:47,421
Surprise!

670
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:54,260
How nice that you were born,
we would have really missed you otherwise.

671
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:59,012
"How nice that we're all together;
we congratulate you, birthday child!"

672
01:26:59,730 --> 01:27:00,939
Happy Birthday.

673
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:04,779
Aren't you happy?

674
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:07,994
My birthday is tomorrow, not today.

675
01:27:08,070 --> 01:27:08,657
Tomorrow?

676
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:10,317
Your birthday is today.

677
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:11,232
Tomorrow.

678
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,133
No, today.

679
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:15,000
You have to blow out the candles.

680
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:33,220
I am afraid I don't have a present for you,
cause I only just heard about it.

681
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:35,537
But I have a present for you.

682
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:41,297
Here you are.
Your name is written on the present.

683
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:43,611
I don't have a name.

684
01:27:43,690 --> 01:27:47,058
I gave it to you, when you were born.

685
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:57,613
Tell me where Nicolas is,
then I tell you your name.

686
01:27:58,610 --> 01:28:04,333
Tell me, where Nicolas is?
Then I will give you your name.

687
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:17,072
He is in the cellar of the water park.

688
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:19,860
Marienbad, where we were yesterday?

689
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:25,416
Where is your telephone? Your telephone!

690
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:29,654
Happy Birthday, Leon.

691
01:28:47,999 --> 01:28:55,218
I want you to go now.
Leave my house and never come back!

692
01:29:07,730 --> 01:29:10,700
I thought, we would celebrate together

693
01:29:56,890 --> 01:29:59,534
You are arrested provisionally.

694
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:01,453
What? You can't do that, we are kids.

695
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:02,900
As of today no longer

696
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Come on!

697
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:07,000
You promised that we celebrate his birthday today, all together

698
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:10,093
You promised it!

699
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:16,219
No, you promised it.

700
01:30:19,730 --> 01:30:22,497
But you promised it.

701
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:26,613
A promise is a promise!

702
01:30:30,490 --> 01:30:33,134
Don't you want to say Good Bye at least?

703
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:34,897
Bye.

704
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:36,013
A Real Good Bye!

705
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:44,852
Bye.

706
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:53,992
Bye.

707
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:57,139
Hands Up!

708
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Into the cellar you pussies!

709
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:23,116
Where is my child?

710
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,793
They didn't find him.

711
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:34,573
WHERE IS MY CHILD?...WHERE IS MY CHILD?
...WHERE IS MY CHILD?

712
01:32:18,210 --> 01:32:19,899
You fucked it up.

713
01:32:23,570 --> 01:32:26,414
There is no way back for him now.

714
01:32:26,490 --> 01:32:28,333
He will not do it.

715
01:32:29,330 --> 01:32:34,097
Go and get a rest Mrs. Doctog
we can handle this from here.

716
01:32:34,170 --> 01:32:36,013
You look tiered.

717
01:33:02,930 --> 01:33:08,653
Crazy, you actually look quite similar.
At least if you know it.

718
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:16,339
Look at the mouth,
it looks just like yours.

719
01:33:16,770 --> 01:33:19,216
Look the corners of the mouth!

720
01:33:19,290 --> 01:33:27,857
You just can't see it, because of the... the...

721
01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:30,740
Mathilda, I am trying to concentrate here.

722
01:33:30,999 --> 01:33:31,897
Sorry.

723
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:44,534
You are scared like shit.

724
01:33:44,650 --> 01:33:46,971
Of cause I am scared,
do I look like a psycho, or what?

725
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:50,661
I can do it for you.
The cops will fuck you.

726
01:33:51,930 --> 01:33:53,773
They will fuck me anyway.

727
01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:56,102
Your mother loved his mouth more than yours.

728
01:33:58,850 --> 01:34:00,493
Although you have the same.

729
01:34:01,490 --> 01:34:03,834
We don't have the same mouth.

730
01:34:06,990 --> 01:34:08,379
Why not, you are brothers?

731
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:18,739
Half brothers.

732
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:26,000
Brothers, half brothers, fuck it!
You have the same mouth.

733
01:34:29,370 --> 01:34:32,170
Mathilda, would you please wait outside?

734
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:42,430
Mathilda, would you please wait outside!

735
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:57,139
I bet, you don't dare it.

736
01:34:57,210 --> 01:34:58,496
Give it back!

737
01:34:58,650 --> 01:35:00,971
It's mine, I stole it!

738
01:35:12,270 --> 01:35:14,414
But the victim is mine.

739
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:42,217
Noisless: I'm sorry!

740
01:36:00,970 --> 01:36:01,701
Shit!

741
01:36:16,490 --> 01:36:23,453
The mother opens the flap from the outside
and puts her baby here into the bed.

742
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:31,210
The bed detects that there is a child
and automatically warms up.

743
01:36:33,210 --> 01:36:41,777
If the flap closes again, a silent alarm is set off
and we take care of the baby.

744
01:36:41,850 --> 01:36:44,060
Really quite simple.

745
01:36:53,330 --> 01:36:59,451
Do some mothers leave something for their children,
some kind of keepsake?

746
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:04,821
Whatever we find next to the child
we keep in these envelopes.

747
01:37:04,890 --> 01:37:10,477
From the age of sixteen, the children have the right
to inspect these things.

748
01:37:11,050 --> 01:37:13,860
May I see the boy's envelope ?

749
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:36,294
Do you know what's in there?

750
01:37:39,410 --> 01:37:43,210
Sometimes a bad past is better than none.

751
01:37:46,150 --> 01:37:53,910
Anna Heinzke, I baptise you in the name
of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

752
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:54,733
Amen.

753
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:04,334
The Lord bless you and keep you.

754
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:09,132
The Lord lift his countenance upon you,
and be gracious to you.

755
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:13,932
The Lord make his face to shine upon you
and give you peace.

756
01:38:14,010 --> 01:38:14,897
Amen.

757
01:38:21,650 --> 01:38:25,450
Come!
You are going to get your birthday present.

758
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:59,052
Today is you birthday, we have to celebrate that.

759
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:02,896
As long as the pussys are singing
this house is ours.

760
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:03,857
Relax!

761
01:39:03,930 --> 01:39:06,740
I swear, there is booze somewhere.

762
01:39:25,970 --> 01:39:26,892
To you!

763
01:39:34,610 --> 01:39:38,820
Here drink! Drink!

764
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:41,291
It will make you relax.

765
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:45,132
Drink!

766
01:40:19,170 --> 01:40:21,616
This will be my birthday present.

767
01:40:58,130 --> 01:41:00,974
Do you like what you see?

768
01:41:19,250 --> 01:41:21,139
Do you like me?

769
01:41:24,530 --> 01:41:26,419
Then show me!

770
01:41:27,330 --> 01:41:29,776
Show me that you like me!

771
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:51,379
Happy Birthday, Leon.

772
01:42:03,290 --> 01:42:07,090
If I ask you for something, will you do it?

773
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:12,999
No matter what it is?

774
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:13,937
Yes.

775
01:42:26,790 --> 01:42:33,080
Tomorrow at breakfast with mum and dad,
we will bring it to an end.

776
01:42:37,010 --> 01:42:37,932
Leon?

777
01:42:42,370 --> 01:42:44,259
I will bring the buns.

778
01:43:37,330 --> 01:43:41,699
We have this more often, sometimes stones,
vomit, deposit bottles...

779
01:43:41,810 --> 01:43:45,337
you can forget that,
the alarm has a delay of fifteen minutes,

780
01:43:45,450 --> 01:43:46,940
so that the mother stays anonymous.

781
01:43:59,210 --> 01:44:01,099
I am here.

782
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:35,053
Your father raped me
I am sorry, Mum.

783
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:40,839
Had a nice day?

784
01:45:54,770 --> 01:45:56,659
Morning. Awake so early?

785
01:45:57,090 --> 01:45:58,421
Yes.

786
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:06,256
I would like to have four
of these normal buns.

787
01:46:08,210 --> 01:46:17,210
Two custard tarts and...
another two of these cross, stuff.

788
01:46:26,450 --> 01:46:30,250
You will talk now, and we keep out of it.

789
01:46:39,220 --> 01:46:41,000
What do you want?

790
01:46:46,610 --> 01:46:48,499
Tell me who I am.

791
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:01,939
Did you know him?

792
01:47:03,230 --> 01:47:04,819
Did you know him?

793
01:47:07,730 --> 01:47:16,332
I was drunk. I just wanted to forget all that.
Three weeks laterl was pregnant.

794
01:47:18,290 --> 01:47:21,134
Why didn't you abort me?

795
01:47:24,690 --> 01:47:28,251
I was still covered by my parents' health insurance.

796
01:47:28,370 --> 01:47:29,257
Bullshit.

797
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:31,693
I was ashamed.

798
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:38,016
I thought it was all my fault
I shouldn't have drank so much.

799
01:47:42,290 --> 01:47:44,179
And then?

800
01:47:46,130 --> 01:47:49,930
What then? I got you.

801
01:47:52,850 --> 01:47:53,772
Where?

802
01:47:55,730 --> 01:47:56,652
WHERE!

803
01:47:57,650 --> 01:47:58,981
On the toilet.

804
01:47:59,570 --> 01:48:02,414
Alone on the toilet.

805
01:48:04,210 --> 01:48:08,420
You were screaming all the time.
I did not know what to do?

806
01:48:08,570 --> 01:48:18,491
When the flap closed, I felt so relieved,
...like all this never happened.

807
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:41,774
Did you give Nicolas the breast?

808
01:48:45,650 --> 01:48:47,539
Did you suckle him?

809
01:48:49,490 --> 01:48:50,412
Yes.

810
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:52,333
Me too?

811
01:48:57,170 --> 01:48:58,092
No.

812
01:49:04,850 --> 01:49:11,540
If you amputate someone's leg,
he can still feel it tickling, even years late:

813
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:16,338
When Nicolas is dead, where will it tickle you?

814
01:49:26,930 --> 01:49:28,819
You didn't do it.

815
01:49:29,810 --> 01:49:31,699
I know Nicolas is well.

816
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:34,580
You want to see him?
It's no pretty sight.

817
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:49,941
Let me alone.

818
01:49:50,930 --> 01:49:52,819
I hate you.

819
01:49:58,610 --> 01:49:59,532
I am sorry.

820
01:49:59,610 --> 01:50:00,497
I am so sorry.

821
01:50:43,730 --> 01:50:48,497
Hello? We will now eat breakfast all together

822
01:50:48,570 --> 01:50:50,413
Like a real family?

823
01:50:51,330 --> 01:50:54,891
Hello? ...Hello?

824
01:50:55,650 --> 01:50:57,618
I brought buns?

825
01:51:33,650 --> 01:51:35,379
Would you hand me the jam, please?

826
01:51:35,490 --> 01:51:36,901
Strawberry, please.

827
01:51:38,850 --> 01:51:40,340
Thank you.

828
01:51:52,850 --> 01:51:55,694
Oh, the coffee is ready.

829
01:52:07,650 --> 01:52:09,140
Milk?

830
01:52:28,370 --> 01:52:30,657
The weather is so beautiful today.

831
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:35,099
Shall we go for a walk?

832
01:52:36,050 --> 01:52:37,939
But you promised it.

833
01:52:38,930 --> 01:52:40,819
A promise is a promise.

834
01:52:40,890 --> 01:52:43,700
You promised it. You can't do that.

835
01:52:45,650 --> 01:52:46,981
A promise is a promise.

836
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:51,379
You always fool me. You always promise something
but you never keep it.

837
01:52:51,450 --> 01:52:54,260
A PROMISE IS A PROMISE!

838
01:52:54,370 --> 01:52:55,212
Asshole!

839
01:53:28,850 --> 01:53:32,650
Mum! Dad!

840
01:53:45,170 --> 01:53:48,014
Say, that you love me!

841
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:52,452
Say it!

842
01:54:05,730 --> 01:54:06,652
Leon?

843
01:54:10,130 --> 01:54:12,974
Leon, I...I would like to see you...

844
01:54:13,050 --> 01:54:14,893
I forgot Mathilda.

845
01:55:46,370 --> 01:55:48,737
I forgot Mathilda.

846
01:55:52,850 --> 01:55:54,739
Me too.

847
01:56:59,090 --> 01:57:00,979
Claudia...

848
01:57:02,530 --> 01:57:04,419
are you all right?

849
01:57:08,690 --> 01:57:11,534
I have tried to reach you all the time.

850
01:57:11,810 --> 01:57:14,420
I have to tell you something.

851
01:57:17,330 --> 01:57:20,174
Just come in for now.
