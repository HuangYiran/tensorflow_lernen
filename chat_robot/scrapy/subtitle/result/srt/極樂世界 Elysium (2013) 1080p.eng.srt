{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Max, are you stealing again?

17
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,140
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}It breaks my heart. Why do you do it?

18
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,960
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}To save up ?

19
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,380
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}You want to buy a ticket to go up there?

20
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,960
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}That place is not for you, or me.

21
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,660
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}It's not fair, sister.

22
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,360
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Why can't I go?

23
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,960
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}There are things in life that can't be explained.

24
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,860
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}We just have to accept them.

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}But one thing I know for sure.

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}One day you'll do something marvellous.

28
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,760
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}You were born for it.

29
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,280
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}My little Max.

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}That's real funny, I have a job. Chistoso.

34
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,640
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Por favor ninos! You think I got money?

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}You must report immediately to your parole officer.

58
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,380
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Thank you, Citizen.

73
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,960
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}No, God, I don't do any of that stupid shit anymore.

74
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,250
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I work at Armadyne. On the line, you know? Working...

85
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,160
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}If I was as smart as you I would have left too.

86
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,510
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Have dinner with me. Just...

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I'll settle for a coffee.

88
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,050
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-No.     -Aww.

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Have I gotta break my other arm to get attention?

90
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,050
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-Stop.     -...'cause I will do that.

91
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,440
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}My life is complicated, Max.

92
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,640
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I just, I... I miss you.

00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,730
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Please take one pill with each meal.

278
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,920
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Thank you for your service.

279
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,810
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}At 15:00 hours yesterday you shot down two shuttles, killing 46 civilians.

280
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,760
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Your mandate is to deal with illegals 'quietly'.

281
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,560
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I am aware of that.

282
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,610
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}And then there's the use of this... agent.

283
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,070
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}A Mr. M. Kruger.

284
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,890
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}15 human rights violations...

285
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,160
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Rapes, kidnappings, torture.

286
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,660
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}The man's been diagnosed with serious psychological issues.

287
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,560
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}We made it explicitly clear to you that we're no longer using sleeper agents.

288
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,910
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Tell me something, President Patel.

289
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,470
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Do you have children?

290
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,110
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I'm not the one being reviewed here.

291
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,950
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Then I will assume you do not.

292
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,360
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Perhaps, if you did have children,

293
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,160
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}then you would behave in a manner

294
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,160
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}that is more conducive to the longevity of this habitat.

295
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:36,360
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I understand, it is not the fashion to think and to act as I do.

296
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,340
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I understand that perfectly.

297
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,490
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}But when they come for your house...

298
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,840
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}or the house you built for your children,..

299
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,880
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}and your children's children...

300
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,060
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}It won't be PR and campaign promises that keep them out.

301
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,710
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}It will be me!

302
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,780
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I've heard enough! This is your final warning.

303
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,570
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Any further unauthorized actions, and you will be removed from office.

304
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,700
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}And let's discharge this agent Kruger permanently.

305
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,860
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}All in favour?

306
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,060
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Good. Effective immediately.

307
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,600
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}You want some beer?

308
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,880
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}You have been discharged from CCB.

309
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,270
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Please return all weapons to local embassy.

310
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,020
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Fuck your 'Politikster'! Fuck you!

311
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,060
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Look...

312
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,610
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Max...

313
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:10,970
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Max!

314
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,370
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}What's wrong? What happened?

315
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,560
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Jesus, let me help you. Let's go.

316
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,000
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Max, what happened?

317
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,110
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-Max, what happened?     -I shouldn't have gone in, man.

318
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,190
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Gone in where?

319
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,580
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I took a full dose, man.

320
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,800
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}A full dose.

321
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,280
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}You're gonna be OK. Let me help.

322
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,690
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-You're gonna be OK, Max.     -They gave me Miporol, man.

323
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:54,470
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}They gave me... Miporol.

324
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,490
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I got five fucking days! I only got five days!

325
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,450
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}You have to take this.

326
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,660
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-They can fix this shit on Elysium, man.     -I know.

327
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,100
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-I'm gonna go see Spider.     -Max, Max!

328
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,330
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Take the pill!

329
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,700
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}There you go!

330
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,170
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}To see Spider, you need money.

331
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,520
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I'll give you everything I have, but it's not enough for a ticket.

332
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,540
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}He's going to give me a ticket.

333
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,360
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}He's gonna give me a fucking ticket.

334
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,080
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Frey, you know we've done everything we could to help your daughter.

335
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,820
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}But I had a meeting today with the board,

336
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,150
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}and they're recommending that we send her home with you.

337
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,140
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}How can I work here and leave her at home?

338
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,960
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}You know it can happen any minute, Dr. Faizel.

339
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,900
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I know, if she has another seizure, of course bring her back here.

340
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,720
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}But until then she's discharged.

341
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,370
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}This isn't Elysium. We can't just heal her.

342
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,530
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Max!

343
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,880
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}It's been a while, my brother!

344
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,980
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}How's life at the factory?

345
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,170
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-I need to ask you a favour.     -What? I can't hear you. What?

346
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:57,310
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I need a ticket. Up there. And an ID.

347
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,900
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Yeah, sure sure.

348
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,540
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Absolutely. You prefer aisle or window?

349
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,960
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I'm being fucking serious, man.

350
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,580
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Listen, I'm gonna come back and work for you.

351
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,770
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Anything you need. I'll fucking pay it back.

352
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,610
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}You know what?

353
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,360
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}This... is...

354
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,320
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}priceless.

355
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,440
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}This is priceless.

356
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,040
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Yeah, let me ask you a question.

357
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,820
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Do you have any idea how many idiots

358
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,290
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}come in here saying the same kinda bullshit?

359
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,760
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I got little kids coming here every day.

360
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:50,550
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Max, if I were you, I'd get the fuck out of here, right now

361
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,530
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Max, No...

362
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,120
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Max, No...

363
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,060
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I did 3 years for you.

364
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,350
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Everything I did for you, you're gonna get me up there.

365
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,380
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-Can you feel this?     -Go ahead and shoot.

366
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,330
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I got so much radiation in my body right now,

367
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,030
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}you're probably getting a little sick yourself.

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Even throw in some snacks and a drink.

397
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:13,150
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}All you have to do is walk into a house and use the med-bay, and you're cured.

398
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,870
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Sandro will do the surgery. You know him?

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}What the fuck am I gonna do?

406
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,250
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I'll have them install...

407

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}...this!

408
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,090
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}A third generation Axo-suit.

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}We hook this into your nerval system, and it'll make you as strong as a droid.

410
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,460
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}You're already under the knife, right?

411
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,460
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Let's get out of here, please.

412
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,190
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I want a 4 man team. But I pick them.

413
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,740
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I'm sending my own data wrangler.

414
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,990
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Brain to brain, that is real tough.

415
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,760
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}OK, but I'm taking Julio. He gets a ticket up there, same as me.

416
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,210
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Yeah, sure.

417

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}OK, I'll go get the boys ready.

418
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,940
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Wait!

419
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,330
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}It's gotta be John Carlyle.

420
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,530
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}The CEO of Armadyne, Carlyle?

421
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,230
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}That's the mark.

422
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,590
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Secretary Delacourt, Mr. Carlyle has arrived.

423

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}You are here to persuade me to renew our Armadyne contracts, yes?

424
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,560
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Astute as always.

425
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,230
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Come with me.

426
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,190
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I'm not interested in your little ideas.

427
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,780
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I am interested in something much larger.

428
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,460
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}This habitat is dying.

429
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,280
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}There is a political sickness inside of it. A tumor that needs to be removed.

430
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:05,350
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}You and your company are in need of revenue that is drying up.

431
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,770
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}So...

432
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,500
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}You built the Torus.

433
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:14,840
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Can you override the servers and place a new president in power?

434
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,480
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}A coup?

435
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,880
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Are you suggesting a coup?

436
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,680
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Is it possible?

437
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,760
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I could write a reboot sequence.

438
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:33,060
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}It'd shut down the entire system, and at that point...

439
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,460
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}you can encode a new President, yes.

440
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,460
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Then that is what you will do.

441
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,060
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}And you will have your contract secured for the next 200 years.

442
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:48,260
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Missile Defense Batteries, Droids, everything we need, to protect our liberty.

443
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,140
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}all guaranteed, of course, by your new President.

444
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,220
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Go! Get to work, Mr. Carlyle.

445
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,350
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}This is the guy.

446
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,270
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-He's the guy?     -This is him.

449
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,180
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Play nice, amigo. Play nice.

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Let's get him an ID first.

451
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,290
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Give the chief one of my identification codes.

452
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,290
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Get that ready.

453
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,290
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Arm up.

454
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,750

664
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,990
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Max, Max, wait.

665
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:14,390
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-Thank you.     -Who did this to you?

666
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:16,950
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I don't know. I got-I got hurt at at work.

667
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:22,600
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I had to take a job from Spider to try to get up there and get healed.

668
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:26,090
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}It went bad, now I'm in trouble.

669
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:27,700
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Mommy?

670
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:32,970
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Hey, sweety, come here!

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Who is that man?

672
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,870
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}His name is Max. Mommy knew him when he was your age.

673
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,980
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-It's Matilda.     -Hi!

674
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,580
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}You can go watch cartoons, OK?

675
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,880
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I'll be right there.

676
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:59,640
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I didn't know you had... I'm so sorry, I need to go.

677
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:03,210
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-Wait, Max, you can not leave.     -I shouldn't have come here. I have to leave!

678
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,570
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Max! She's dying. She's in the final stages of leukemia.

679
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:12,390
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I told you my life complicated. I need you to help me.

680
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,860
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-I've no idea how to do this.     -How to do what?

681
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:19,180
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-Get her to Elysium.     -I can't help her. I...

682
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:21,800
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I would if I could.

683
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:25,680
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}How about this? Fake citizenship. If you took her there,

684
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,910
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-could you heal her with this?     -It doesn't work that way.

685
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,360
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}This is coded to me, it's locked to my DNA.

686
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:36,430
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}The people looking for me. They... You don't understand who these people are.

687
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:39,390
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}If they find me here, they will kill all of us.

688
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:42,750
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}The only thing I can do to help you is leave. I promise you.

689
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:46,080
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-She's all I have.     -I'm sorry.

690
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:54,550
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}You have bandages.

691
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,290
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Yeah. I got bandages.

692
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,560
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}What are you doing?

693
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:08,020
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I don't want you to be sick. You wanna hear a story?

694
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,190
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}N.., ah...

695
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,840
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}There once was a meerkat who lived in the jungle.

696
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,830
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}He was hungry and he was small.

697
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,710
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}So small.

698
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:24,770
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}And the other big animals had all the food, 'cause they could reach the fruits.

699
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:28,060
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}So he made friends with a hippopotamus

700
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,860
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}OK, stop!

701
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,650
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}It doesn't end well for the meerkat.

702
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:39,760
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Yes, it does 'cause he can stand on the hippopotamus' back

703
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:43,080
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}to get all the fruits that he wants.

704
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:48,000
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-What's in it for the hippo?     -The hippo wants a friend.

705
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,260
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I'm sorry.

706
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:45,680
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Hey, boss.

707
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,380
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I think we got him.

708
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:57,390
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Yank this fucking cunt!

709
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:25,680
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-Mommy, is everything OK?     -It's OK, sweety.

710
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:37,180
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Clear!

711
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:41,480
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}What is this?

712
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,280
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Good afternoon.

713

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Sorry to come bursting into your home. Didn't mean to...

714
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,780
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}traumatize your young daughter.

715
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,660
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Me and the boys here are looking for a young gentleman...

716
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,500
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}who was in this very house a moment ago.

717
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:00,480
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}We're hoping you can tell us where he went.

718
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,270
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}No.

719
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,380
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}I...

720

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-I don't know where he is.     -I don't believe in ...

721
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:13,370
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}...committing violent acts in front of the kids.

722

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-It's OK.     -I really need you to tell me.

724
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:22,380
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Hey?

725
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,960

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Close your eyes, keep your fucking eyes closed.

727
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,360
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Keep her eyes closed.

728
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,070
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Please, I don't know where he is.

729
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:33,380
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}He was wounded, I helped him and he left.

730
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,260
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Please!

01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:45,080
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}What's this here?

733
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:48,910
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}-This a hospital you're running here?     -She's sick.

734

762
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,140

782
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,960
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}We can change the course of fucking history!

{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Something for which we were born.

1064
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,310
{\bord1\shad2\1c&HFFFF80&\3c&HAA5500&\4c&HFF9F40&\blur3}Fuck you!
