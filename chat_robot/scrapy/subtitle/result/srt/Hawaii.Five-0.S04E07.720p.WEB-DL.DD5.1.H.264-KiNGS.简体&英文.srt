13
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,110
我还是觉得不太好
I'm still not comfortable with this.

14
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,000
史蒂夫  岛上谁不认识你和五零特遣队
Steve, everyone on this rock knows you and Five-O.

15
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,280
所以如果你们出现的话
So if you guys show up,

16
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,700
你们还没从前门进来
the clientele's gonna be out the back door

17
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,020
目标就已经从后门跑了
before you even step foot in the front,

18
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,640
但他们不认识我
but they don't know me.

19
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,400
-那我们换个地方吧  -不  不行
- Maybe we do a different location.  - No, no, no.

20
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,610
这家伙不想任何人知道他在赌场
This guy doesn't want anyone to know that he's in the casino,

21
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,690
所以这是唯一
so it's the only place

22
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,690
他不会带保镖的地方
where he's not gonna have security with him.

23
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,450
我监视过那里  我知道怎么进去
I've surveilled it; I know how to get in,

24
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,570
我也知道怎么出来  一举成功
I know how to get out. Boom.

25
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,020
如果你的身份被识破  怎么办
What if you get compromised?

26
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,540
我会随机应变
I'll improvise.

27
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,070
是你让我尽快回到正轨的  好吗
You're the one who told me to get back up on the horse, okay?

28
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,390
你说得没错
And you were right.

29
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,450
所以这次让我去做吧
So you're just gonna have to let me do this.

00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,030
干嘛  你要给我授权
What, are you deputizing me?

32
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,540
只是以防万一  好吗
Just in case, all right?

33
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,250
别担心  不会有事的
Don't worry, it's gonna be fine.

34
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,020
我能行的  好吗
I've got this covered, okay?

35
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,490
没事的
It's gonna be fine.

派司拉  又名花旗骰  一种赌博玩法

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,760
看来你不适合在赌桌对面下注呢
Betting against the table hasn't been working for you, huh?

41
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,620
也许换种玩法能赢钱哦
Maybe you can get lucky some other way.

42
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,840
我们是不是在哪见过  小姐
Haven't we met before, Miss?

43
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,510
你想做什么
What do you want?

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,930

在选呢
Picking up.

52
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,610
如果运气好  能冲个炫酷的浪
If we're lucky, we'll get swell.

53
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,320
煎饼好吃吗

54
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,820
你太了解我了

55
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,600
那是好事还是坏事

56
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,960
好事

57
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,620
还需要什么吗  恋爱男
Anything else, lover boy?

58

娜妮  你在我背后偷看吗
Nani, you reading over my shoulder?

59
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,870
只看到腻歪的部分
Only the dirty parts.

60
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,010
还要咖啡吗
More coffee?

61
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,020
结账吧  谢谢
Just the check, please.

62
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,990
已经有人给你付掉了
Oh, it's already taken care of.

63
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,690
柜台那儿的那位先生
Gentleman at the counter.

64
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,660
-谢谢  娜妮  -没事
- Thanks, Nani.  - Sure.

65
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,440
给我钱干吗
What's that for?

66
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,260
格罗弗队长
Well, Captain Grover,

67
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,130
开门见山  我出来混也不是一两天了
let's just say I've been around long enough to know that

68
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,020
有人埋单  必有所求
when someone pays for your meal they usually want something.

69
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,120
拜托
Come on.

70
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,440
别那么愤世嫉俗嘛
Are you really that cynical?

71
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,750
我们那里  警察总相互埋单
Where I'm from, cops do that for each other.

72
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,620
再说  我之前拿枪指着你
Besides, I figured it was the least I could do

73
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,570
就当是聊表歉意的小小心意吧
after pointing a shotgun in your face.

74
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,630
是啊  那次人质事件搞得大家都挺不愉快的
Yeah, well, that hostage crisis was rough on everyone.

75
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,560
我觉得双方都有责任  这么说才公平
I think it's fair to say that there was fault on both sides.

76
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,280
警督
Lieutenant,

77
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,610
我知道州长给了你们特权
I realize the governor gives you guys a free pass,

78
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,540
但老实说
but to be honest,

79
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,890
那天我在那里看到的你的所作所为
that behavior I saw out there in the field the other day,

80
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,290
足以令你和你的警察兄弟们
that's a surefire way to get yourself alienated

81
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,120
分道扬镳
from your brothers in blue.

82
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,760
我是说  如果哪天你需要后援时
I mean, i'd hate to see you in a situation

83
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,730
后援却没有出现  这太糟糕了
where you call for backup and it doesn't show.

84
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,530
我觉得  这些话你该跟麦格瑞特去说
I think you need to be having this conversation with McGarrett.

85
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,030
我不觉得
I don't think so.

86
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,770
我不想跟麦格瑞特谈
I'm not having this conversation with McGarrett.

87
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,300
麦格瑞特都不算一个真正的警察
McGarrett's not a real cop.

88
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,670
他不会像警察一样去思考
He doesn't think like a cop,

89
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,110
也不会像警察一样去处事
he doesn't act like a cop.

90
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,790
但是你...
You, on the other hand...

91
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,730
我查过了  你是个好警察
I did my homework; you're a good cop.

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,800
在度过了这么大的难关之后  重新回到警队
Got your badge back after going through a rough patch.

93
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,200
我知道那是什么感觉
I know what that's like.

94
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,110
祝你有美好一天  队长
Have a nice day, Captain.

95
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,280
来了
I'm coming

96
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,100
我说了来了
I said I'm coming!

97
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,390
来了  来了
All right, all right.

98
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,790
是个女孩  恭喜

99
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,020
玛丽  怎么...
Mary, what...

100
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,980
你该看看你的脸
You should see your face.

101
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,180
你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

102
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,900
这是谁的孩子
Who's baby is this?

103
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,280
我的
Mine.

104
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,760
不  不是吧
No, it's not.

105
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,960
她是我的孩子
She's mine.

106
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,770
-我领养了她  -你在说什么
- I adopted her.  - What are you talking about?

107
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,800
她怎么会是你的孩子
How could it be yours?

108
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,910
已经领养一段时间了
It's been in the works for a while,

109
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,180
但是我挑最后期限才带回来
but I kept in on the DL

110
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,260
以防某人会有意见
in case a certain someone was gonna be critical about it.

111
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,540
不敢相信
I don't believe it.

112
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,970
她多可爱啊
Isn't she cute?

113
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,790
我给她取了爸爸的名字
I named her after Dad.

114
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,910
-你给她取名为约翰  -不是  是琼
- Oh, you named her John? - No, Joan.

115
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,070
玛丽  我不是有意见
Mary, I don't want to be critical,

116
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,010
但是你自己的生活还没打理好
but you have difficulty managing your own life.

117
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,230
你要怎么多照顾一个婴儿
How you gonna look after the baby?

118
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,500
我都能照顾好一个九十岁的老头
I think I took care of a 90-year-old man pretty well.

119
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,810
只照顾了三周  而且还死了
For three weeks, and he died.

120
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,960
他自然死亡的  好吗
He died of natural causes, okay?

121
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,630
好吧
Okay.

122
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,280
你得把孩子还回去  玛丽
You got to give her back, Mary.

123
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,260
史蒂夫  我不能像台游戏机一样就把她还了
Steve, I can't return her like she's an Xbox.

124
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,610
她不是游戏机
She's not an Xbox.

125
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,350
她是一个小婴儿  好吗
She's a little baby person, okay,

126
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,960
你的下半辈子都得
and this is a responsibility you're gonna have

127
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,970
对她负责
for the rest of your life.

128
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,450
被你念得都不想当妈了
You're really killing my buzz being a new mom.

129
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,820
谢谢
Thanks.

130
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,060
是我  好
Yeah? Okay.

131
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,200
我马上来
I'm on the way.

132
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,440
我得走了  听着
I got to go. All right, listen,

133
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,000
等我回来了我们再谈
we'll talk about this when I get back.

134
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,940
拜拜
Bye.

135
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,330
兄弟  听我说  在我看来
Buddy, listen to me, the way I see it,

136
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,680
不是玛丽领养孩子  而是你
Mary didn't adopt a kid; you did.

137
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,240
因为这只是时间的问题
All right, 'cause it's only a matter of time

138
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,100
在这个可怜的小宝贝
before that poor, unfortunate child

139
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,810
凌晨三点嚷着要喝奶的时候
is looking for some suckling at 3:00 A.M.,

140
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,760
她肯定会被丢给你的
is gonna be looking to you.

141
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,490
-不  不会这么闹心的  -不会吗
-No, there's gonna be no suckling,  -No?

142
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,210
因为那孩子会被送回去
'Cause that baby is going back.

143
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,560
你打算送孩子回去  回哪  孤儿院吗
Oh, you're gonna send it back, what, to the orphanage?

144
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,060
跟那些没人要的孩子们呆在一起吗
With a bunch of other kids that nobody wants?

145
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,630
-什么  -行  没事  那想法不错
- What? - Yeah, no, it's a good idea.

146
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,630
我的意思说  这办法总比
I mean, it's probably a better idea

147
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,620
让你妹妹照顾要好一点
than leaving it with your sister.

148
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,940
等等  你好像不赞成这么做
Wait a minute, I thought you didn't approve?

149
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,980
我不赞成
I don't approve.

150
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,420
那你到底站在哪一边
Okay, whose side are you on then?

151
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,800
我站在孩子能得到关爱这一边
I'm on the side where the kid has a chance of being loved.

152
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,380
如果你觉得玛丽能够胜任
If you think Mary is capable of doing that,

153
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,870
那我会非常支持的
then I'm all for it, okay?

154
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,370
先生们  我们这有一位男性受害人
Gentlemen, what we have here is a male victim.

155
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,340
死因显然是多处刀伤所致
C.O.D. is quite evident based on the multiple stab wounds.

156
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,880
他很可能是在水里遇到袭击
He was most likely attacked in the water.

157
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,330
也许是几个人在争抢这块分界带的归属权
Maybe a couple of guys got territorial over this break,

158
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,490
接着情况就失控了
and then it got out of hand.

159
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,800
分析得很有道理  但应该不是
A reasonable theory, but highly unlikely.

160
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,730
受害者的手部没有明显的防御性伤痕
The victim's hands are noticeably free of defensive wounds,

161
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,210
这就说明袭击是突发且在死者意料之外
which suggests that the attack was sudden and unexpected.

162
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,460
好吧  身份确认了吗
Okay, do we get an ID?

163
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,890
正要去确认
I was just getting to that.

164
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,070
我刚询问了负责的这片区域的救生员
Just spoke to a lifeguard who patrols this area.

165
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,350
他说受害人是这里的常客
He said our vic's a regular,

166
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,710
无论是否有浪  每周一早上九点都会来
here every Monday 9:00 A.M., swell or no swell.

167
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,610
就是说他的行程可以预测
Okay, so predictable schedule,

168
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,450
他受到了近距离的攻击
he's hit up close and personal,

169
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,770
而且没有防御性伤痕
no defensive wounds.

170
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,170
受害人可能是被熟人所杀
Our victim could've been attacked by somebody who knew him.

171
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,980
受害人名叫布赖恩・卡彭特
Our victim has been identified as Bryan Carpenter.

172
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,970
挟持人质  毒品交易  盗窃
Pinches for assault, drug charges, grand larceny,

173
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,380
这家伙几年里犯的事可真多啊
guy's been in and out of trouble for years.

174
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,560
可能是仇家跟着他来到海边的
Looks like his troubles followed him out to sea.

175
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,330
卡哈拉  布赖恩・卡彭特的住宅

176
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,330
卡哈拉  布赖恩・卡彭特的住宅

177
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,140
有被破门而入的迹象
Got signs of a break-in.

178
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,540
这里已经被人翻查过了
Place has been tossed.

179
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,830
安全
Clear.

180
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,910
恐怕他们已经找到想要的东西了
I wonder if they found what they were looking for.

181
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,190
那是什么
What is that?

182
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,090
排水管下面有东西
Something under this drain.

183
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,390
这可能就是他们在找的东西
This could be what they were looking for.

184
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,440
里面还有什么
There's something else in there.

185
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,900
-哦  天呐  -阿成  是什么
-Oh, my God.  -Chin, what is it?

186
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,770
受害人不叫布赖恩・卡彭特
Our victim wasn't Bryan Carpenter.

187
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,810
法医办公室

188
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,810
法医办公室

189
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,260
他的名字叫麦特・赫钦斯
His name is Matt Hutchins.

190
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,350
几年前我在警校
He was a cadet at the Police Academy

191
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,490
教关于执行搜查令的课程时
when I was teaching a class

192
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,730
他是一名学员
on executing search warrants a few years ago.

193
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,030
一般情况下我不会记得学生
Normally, I don't remember students,

194
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,210
但麦特问了很多很有见地的问题
but Matt asked a lot of really smart questions.

195
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,040
有一天  他下课后拦住了我
One day, he cornered me after class

196
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,030
问我这份工作到底是什么样的
and asked me what the job was really like.

197
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,840
这孩子想要有所建树
The kid wanted to make a difference,

198
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,020
但不知道能不能做得到
but wasn't even sure it was possible.

199
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,450
他长大的地方很乱
He grew up in a rough neighborhood,

200
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,460
到处是毒贩  黑帮
drug dealing, gangs.

201
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,870
当我问他"为什么要做警察"时
When I asked him, "Why be a cop?"

202
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,790
他说他只懂这个"游戏"的规则
he said that "The game" was the only thing he knew,

203
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,220
他的将来不是混黑道  就是混白道
and that he would end up on one side of it or the other.

204
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,080
他希望能选择正确的道路
He wanted to take the right path.

205
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,170
所以他当上了警察
So he became a cop.

206
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,310
可是麦特从没拿到过警徽
Well, Matt never got his badge.

207
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,090
他在突击搜查中被查到藏有海洛因
He was busted for heroin possession.

208
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,680
于是被开除出了警校
He got kicked out of the Academy.

209
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,810
我当时很遗憾
I was disappointed.

210
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:06,410
我是ATF的特别探员布莱克・肯尼迪
Special Agent Blake Kennedy, ATF.

211
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,860
烟酒枪械管理署

212
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,040
我刚接到一通电话
I just got a call?

213
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,370
我的手下怎么了
What happened to my guy?

214
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,620
什么  你的手下
Sorry. Your guy?

215
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,210
麦特・赫钦斯在为ATF
Matt, uh, Hutchins was working

216
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,520
执行一项长期卧底行动
a long-term undercover op for ATF.

217
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,950
我是他的联络人
I was his handler.

218
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,630
那么他从没被警校开除过
So he was never kicked out of the Academy.

219
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,890
开除  当然没有  那都是帮他做的掩护
Kicked out? Hell no. That was all part of his cover.

220
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,000
是什么行动
What was the op?

221
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,050
我们让他渗入一个走私枪支的团伙
We had him infiltrate a gang of gunrunners.

222
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,110
一条联系亚洲和美国本土的走私网
A network with ties to Asia and the mainland.

223
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,420
麦特的任务是确认团伙人员的身份
Matt's job was to ID the players

224
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,170
以及记下交易记录
and record transactions,

225
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,080
而我们正要针对这些人铲除这个走私网
and we were just about to drop the net on these guys.

226
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,580
再过几周  麦特就可以功成身退了
Another few weeks and Matt would've a career bust.

227
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,660
如果你的人已经那么深入的话
If you guys were that close,

228
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,950
我们就得假设一件事了...
we have to assume one thing...

229
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,600
麦特的掩护身份被识破了
Matt's cover was compromised.

230
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,040
他是怎么死的
How?

231
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,970
他在今天早上遭到了袭击
He was attacked this morning.

232
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,670
我们认为他是被人故意杀害的
We believe he was deliberately targeted.

233
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,390
在哪儿
Where?

234
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,970
玛卡普乌海滩
Baby Makapu'u Beach.

235
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,940
我们今天刚去过那儿
We were just there today.

236
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,970
有目击者称他每周一都会去那儿
A witness told us that he surfed there every Monday.

237
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,630
我每周一都会带着儿子去那儿
My son and I go there every Monday.

238
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,380
他不能暴露自己
Well, he couldn't break cover,

239
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,170
我相信  这是他守护你们的方式
but I'm sure that was his way of keeping an eye on you.

240
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,780
你们查出是谁干的吗
Do you know who did this?

241
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,280
我们认为是他在卧底行动中结识的人
We believe it had something to do with his undercover assignment.

242
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,960
他在调查那些人  他恨他们
Those people he was investigating, he hated them.

243
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,190
你俩多久交流一次
How often did you two speak?

244
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,530
几周一次
Every few weeks.

245
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,600
一通短信  或是几句电话里的寒暄
A text here, a quick phone call there.

246
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,310
每次都是用不同的号码
Always from a different number.

247
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,190
但是上一次
But the last time,

248
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,400
他的声音有些不一样...
his tone was different...

249
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,800
怎么说
How so?

250
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,030
我也说不上来
I don't know.

251
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,610
听上去他很开心
He sounded happy.

252
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,520
所以我就以为
So I was under the impression that

253
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,500
也许很快就要结束了
maybe it was coming to an end and...

254
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,880
他可能很快就能回来了
he'd be home soon.

255
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,790
我丈夫为这份工作献出了一切
My husband sacrificed everything for that job.

256
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,260
警督  你一定要抓到害死他的王八蛋
Lieutenant, you need to find the bastards who did this.

257
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,910
这是我们在查的人  J.C.戴克
This is the guy we're after, J.C. Dekker.

258
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,560
他早期在北海岸
He spent his wayward youth on the North Shore

259
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,570
靠走私冰毒出名
making a name for himself in the ice trade.

260
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,130
十年前  他把生意转移到了这里
Now, ten years ago, he moved his operation into town

261
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,740
还升级了业务
and he upgraded his clientele,

262
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,700
开始走私分销枪支
focusing primarily on weapons distribution.

263
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,600
这些人都是一开始就跟着他混的人
Guys right below him have been there since the first dollar.

264
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,790
每个人都是单独招募入伙
Everyone else has been recruited along the way.

265
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,070
看上去麦特还挺有自己的一套
Looks like Matt worked his way up the chain of command.

266
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,530
正如我所说  那是麦特的天赋
Well, like I said: That was Matt's talent.

267
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,650
他知道见什么人说什么话
He was able to talk the talk,

268
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,240
以此来赢得自己的地位
and that earned him respect.

269
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:50,600
如果需要的话
And when it came time,

270
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,290
他不惜使用武力
he wasn't afraid to use some muscle.

271
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,330
我刚把他送进去的时候
When I first sent him in,

272
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,390
还不知道是什么情况
we didn't know what to expect.

273
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,840
我们以为最多是一个六个月的行动
We thought it was a six-month op at most.

274
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,180
但是因为麦特获取的情报很详尽
But Matt's intel was so good,

275
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,860
我们很快发现这是一起大案子
we soon realized we were sitting on a major case.

276
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,800
好吧  麦特不在了
Right, now that Matt's gone,

277
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,340
抓住这些坏蛋的机会也没有了
so are the chances of taking these guys out.

278
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,070
所以我才选戴克
That's why I like Dekker for this.

279
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,810
动机  手段  机会
Motive, means, opportunity.

280
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,120
这些人呢  发生了什么
What about these guys? What happened to them?

281
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,710
行动中阵亡
KIA.

282
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,650
就算戴克这么厉害  他还是遇到了问题
As tight as Dekker's operation is, he has his problems.

283
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,950
过去几个月里
In the last few months,

284
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,030
这些人渣被抢劫了好几次
these dirtbags have been robbed a number of times

285
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,490
是由一个暂未查明身份的三人团伙所为
by a three-man crew we have yet to identify.

286
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,990
这些抢劫是怎么发生的
How were these robberies going down?

287
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,350
这不是街头随机发生的抢劫
It wasn't any street-level, crime-of-opportunity stuff.

288
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,610
这是计划周全的劫逃行动
I mean, we're talking well-coordinated hit-and-runs.

289
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,000
现金交易  他们会抢
Cash drops, they were there.

290
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,900
武器存货  他们也抢
Guns in storage, they were there.

291
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,780
也许戴克认为麦特出卖了他们
All right, well, maybe Dekker thought Matt was selling 'em out.

292
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,020
把信息泄露给劫匪  害死他的小弟们
Giving information to the guys who were ripping off his boys.

293
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,310
也或许戴克发现麦特是个警察
Or maybe Dekker figured out Matt was a cop.

294
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,680
不管哪种推论
I mean, either way,

295
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,860
戴克都至少有两个杀掉这孩子的动机
Dekker had at least two motives to kill this kid.

296
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,880
-我们需要该案件的所有资料  -好的
- We're gonna need everything on this case. - Yeah.

297
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,820
琳达  你能过来一下吗
Linda, can you come over here for a moment?

298
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,050
琳达・戴维斯
Linda Davies,

299
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,900
这是史蒂夫・麦格瑞特
this is Steve McGarrett,

300
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,000
丹尼・威廉姆斯警探
Detective Danny Williams.

301
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,010
-你好  -他们是五零特遣队的
- Hi. - They're with Five-O.

302
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,600
琳达负责誊写麦特的所有报告
Now, Linda transcribed all of Matt's reports.

303
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,790
她会把所有你们需要的给你们
She'll get you everything you need.

304
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,320
当然  这边请
Of course. Right this way.

305
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,720
资料全在这里了
This is everything.

306
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,600
戴维斯小姐  冒昧地问一句
Ms. Davies, do you mind if we ask you

307
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,110
你和麦特有多熟悉
how well did you know Matt?

308
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,020
我们其实没见过面
We actually never met.

309
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,320
过去四年里  我只能听到他的声音
I've listened to his voice for the past four years.

310
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,000
他的每一份报告都由我誊写
I transcribed every one of his reports.

311
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,200
所以我能分辨什么时候他过得好
So I could tell when he was having a good week

312
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,160
什么时候过得不好
and when, when it was bad.

313
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,210
最近的几个报告里他看起来如何
How did he sound in his last few reports?

314
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,140
有没有异常  他提到什么威胁了吗
Anything unusual? Did he mention any threats?

315
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,170
如果你是想问他的身份是否暴露
If you're asking me if his cover was blown,

316
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,440
我只能这么说
I can tell you this:

317
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,330
做卧底的时间越长
the longer you leave an undercover out there,

318
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,930
就越容易感到疲劳  压抑  大意
they get tired and depressed, sloppy.

319
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,380
接着开始犯错
They start making mistakes.

320
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,700
这话不该我来说  但是我真的觉得
It's not my place to say this, but I, I really think

321
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,300
几个月前就有足够的证据将他们缉拿归案
we had enough to take these guys down months ago.

322
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,280
你为什么这么说
What makes you say that?

323
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,550
这份工作我做了很久了
I've been working this job for a while now,

324
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,250
我见过这个部门在证据更少的情况抓人
and I've seen this department take people down for much less.

325
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,180
如果我们能按照以往的方式出牌
If we would have done what we normally do,

326
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,790
我不禁会去想
I-I just can't help but wonder

327
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,410
麦特也许还能活着
if Matt would still be alive.

328
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,990
你来说还是我来说
All right, are you gonna say it or am I?

329
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,120
我没打算说话
I'm not saying anything.

330
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,100
我还没准备好指点江山
I'm not ready to start pointing fingers.

331
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,070
那好  我来说
Okay, I'll say it.

332
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,460
如果ATF几个月前能进行逮捕
If the ATF could have made an arrest months ago,

333
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,410
他们为什么不这样做
why didn't they?

334
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,340
将麦特留作卧底超过预定期限
Keeping Matt out there past his sell-by date

335
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,590
会暴露他的身份
could have compromised his cover.

336
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,120
要瓦解这样一个组织
Dismantling an operation like this,

337
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,830
并没有想象中那么简单
it is not as easy as it sounds.

338
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,180
想一想麦特  好吗
Think about Matt, all right?

339
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,750
这个人  也许他厌倦了
This guy, maybe he, uh, maybe he got tired,

340
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,290
也许他想家了  也许哪里疏忽了
maybe he missed his family, maybe somewhere he slipped up.

341
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,010
也许他疏忽了
Maybe he slipped up,

342
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,430
又或许是肯尼迪把他留在那里太久了
and maybe Kennedy kept Matt out there too long

343
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,420
因为他只在乎破案
because he cared more about making his case

344
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,330
不在乎手下的性命
than he did about looking after his boy.

345
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,240
也许  但是就像我说的
Maybe, but like I said,

346
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,320
在掌握有力的证据之前
I am not ready for pointing fingers

347
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,560
我是不会乱指江山的
until we have something that is real, okay?

348
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,970
我来告诉你什么有力
I'll tell you what's real:

349
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,060
J.C. 戴克  而且我告诉你
J.C. Dekker. And let me tell you something else.

350
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,810
一旦他有一秒怀疑
If he suspected for one second

351
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,620
麦特是警察  他都会解决了他
that Matt was a cop, he would take care of business.

352
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,380
我同意
I agree.

353
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,420
但是现在去打草惊蛇不是好主意
But to go rattle that cage right now is a terrible idea

354
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,970
因为我们可能坏了ATF整整三年的行动
because we could blow the ATF's entire three-year operation.

355
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,260
所以我们小心处理
So we'll tread lightly.

356
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,560
现在能听我说话了吗
Got your attention now or what?!

357
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,950
喂喂喂  说好的"小心处理"呢
Hey, hey, hey, what happened to "Tread lightly," Huh?

358
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,540
我给你三秒钟让你把手从我喉咙拿开
I'm giving you three seconds to get your hands off my throat.

359
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,540
不然呢
Or what?

360
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,350
你穿黑衣的女友还好吗
How's your girlfriend look in black?

361
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,880
坐下
Sit.

362
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,360
现在你听仔细了
Now listen to me very carefully:

363
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,280
你不准乱说话
You're done mouthing off.

364
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,690
从现在开始我问你的问题
I'm gonna ask the questions from now on.

365
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,730
你只需点头回答是或不是
You're just gonna nod yes or no.

366
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,500
布赖恩・卡彭特  你认识他吗
Bryan Carpenter, do you know him?

367
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,210
这动作算不上是或不是
That's not technically a yes or a no.

368
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,600
我就当你说是
I'm gonna take it as a yes.

369
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,140
顺便假设这是你的杰作
I'm also gonna assume that you did this.

370
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,000
出什么事了
What happened?

371
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,040
今天早上  你在哪里
This morning, where were you?

372
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,890
服从国家对我身体主权的
Complying with the state's unconstitutional invasion

373
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,480
违宪侵入
of my physical sovereignty.

374
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,460
什么玩意
Come again?

375
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,660
我的假释官让我去验尿
I was peeing in a cup for my P.O.

376
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,440
你可以问他
You can ask him.

377
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,280
好吧  这也不能证明你没有下令杀他
Okay, well, that still doesn't mean you didn't order the hit.

378
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,230
我为什么要杀他  布赖恩是我的朋友
Why would I do that? Bryan was my friend.

379
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,620
暂时假设你在说实话
Let's assume that you're telling the truth again for two seconds.

380
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,340
为什么会有人想要杀他
Why would somebody want to kill him?

381
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,810
我不知道
I have no idea.

382
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,240
而且你为什么会在乎我的人
And why do you care about one of mines anyway?

383
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,070
难道你现在不应该
Shouldn't you be celebrating

384
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,140
在甜甜圈店或者哪儿庆祝吗
at a donut shop or something right now?

385
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,360
听起来不错
That sounds excellent.

386
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,820
起来
Get up.

387
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:14,090
接下来这几天  你给我什么都别做
Now here's your itinerary for the next couple of days: nothing.

388
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,870
你不能离开这里  明白吗
You don't move from here, you understand?

389
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,220
火奴鲁鲁警局会在这里看着你
HPD's gonna sit on your place

390
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,560
直到我们破案
until we straighten this out.

391
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,710
如果我知道你离开
If I hear that you leave,

392
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,540
就算是去图书馆拿藏书
even to take your library books back,

393
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,800
威廉姆斯警探和我  我们会再来
Detective Williams and I, we're gonna come back

394
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,830
下次我俩就没这么有礼貌了
and we're not gonna be as courteous next time.

395
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,100
他还真是不动声色
Well, that was very subtle.

396
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,640
我肯定他正在给杀麦特那人打电话
I'm sure he's calling whoever killed Matt right now

397
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,890
告诉他们要低调
and telling 'em to lay low.

398
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,980
你在说什么  他没下令实施那次袭击
What are you talking? He didn't order the hit.

399
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,890
你没看到他脸上的表情吗
Did you see the look on his face?

400
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,170
他什么也不知道
He didn't know anything.

401
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,840
好吧  如果是这样
Okay, well, if that's the case,

402
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,490
那我们就得考虑
then we have to consider

403
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,830
麦特手脚不干净的可能性  好吗
the possibility that Matt was dirty, okay?

404
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,780
-不干净  -是的  不干净  好吗
- Dirty. - Yes, dirty, okay?

405
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,220
如果他在向那帮人售卖信息
If he was selling information to the crew

406
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,830
让戴克遭殃  而他自己却溜之大吉
that ripped off Dekker and he slipped off somewhere,

407
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,900
这可能会给他惹来杀身之祸
it would've gotten him killed.

408
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,120
丹尼  麦特是个警察
Danny, Matt was a cop.

409
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,530
我知道他是个警察  好吗
I know he was a cop, okay?

410
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,910
我在新泽西的时候认识不少人
I knew plenty of guys back in New Jersey

411
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,470
他们做卧底的时间太久了
that were undercover for so long,

412
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,530
最终陷入深渊
they ended up slipping;

413
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,530
他们不知道界线在哪里
they didn't know what the line was.

414
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,210
等等  等一下
Just-Just wait. Just wait.

415
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,710
是的  玛丽
Yes, Mary?

416
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,160
等等  什么
Wait-- what?!

417
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,870
开始了
And so it begins.

418
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,130
沙门氏菌
Salmonella?

419
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,360
真的还假的
Really?

420
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,540
我不应该在飞机上吃那个鸡蛋沙拉
I shouldn't have eaten that egg salad on the plane.

421
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,780
是啊
Yeah.

422
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,030
玛丽  这正是我们之前谈论过的情况
Mary, this is exactly what we were talking about before.

423
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,840
史蒂夫  坏掉的鸡蛋和我抚养孩子的技能
Steve, bad eggs have nothing to do

424
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,570
没有任何关系  好吗
with my parenting skills, okay?

425
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,040
我能做一个好妈妈
I could be a good mother,

426
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,430
只是不是现在而已
just not right now.

427
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,870
我真的需要你帮我照看一下琼
I really need you to watch Joan for me

428
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,590
因为我得在这儿过夜
'cause I have to stay here overnight.

429
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,150
不不不  我做不到
No! No, no, no! I can't do that.

430
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,340
史蒂夫  你必须这么做
Steve, you have to.

431
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,240
玛丽  不行  玛丽...
Mary, no, Mary...

432
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,820
我不知道还能找谁
I don't have anybody else to call!

433
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,410
-我得在这儿过...-玛丽
- I have to stay here over...  - Mary.

434
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,340
我现在正忙着
I'm in the middle, I'm in the middle

435
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,600
调查一宗凶杀案
of a homicide investigation.

436
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,410
好吧
Okay.

437
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,340
那我就打给儿童保护机构好了
I'll just call Child Protective Services.

438
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,770
然后琼就只能被安置在
And Joan will have to be placed

439
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,390
某个寄养家庭一阵子了
with a foster care family for a while.

440
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,500
我只希望这样的创伤不会
I just hope that the trauma doesn't

441
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,860
对她的认知发育有什么影响
affect her cognitive development.

442
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,530
认知  你都不知道这个词是什么意思
Cognitive? You don't even know what that word means.

443
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,820
你这个舅舅糟透了
You're a horrible uncle,

444
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,090
你知道吗
you know that?

445
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,020
很好笑吗
This funny to you?

446
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,890
当然了
Yeah!

447
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,560
那你笑完了之后
So when you're through amusing yourself,

448
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,570
帮我给她擦干净然后换尿布  拜托了
I need you to wipe down and change her pad, please.

449
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,010
我才不要  我早就不做奶爸了  你知道的
Not at all. I'm retired, you see.

450
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,600
而且看史蒂夫舅舅换尿布
And it's gonna be way too entertaining

451
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,960
实在是太有趣了  加油哦
to see Uncle Steve on diaper duty. So go ahead.

452
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,290
你胸口怎么"戴"了个孩子
Hey, why is there a baby attached to your chest?

453
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,070
是玛丽的
Oh, uh, Mary.

454
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,440
哦  不说了  祝你好运 
Ah. Say no more. Mazel tov.

455
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,660
-谢了  -总之  我找到我们在
-Thanks.  - Anyway, I was able to track down

456
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,130
麦特家发现的那个钥匙的制造商了
the manufacturer of the key we found at Matt's house.

457
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,640
-好样的  -能追查到是他们卖给
- Oh, good. - It traces back to a set of locks

458
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,230
火奴鲁鲁动物园的一组锁
that they sold to Honolulu Zoo.

459
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,360
让我来看看
Oh, let me see that.

460
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,720
事实上  你知道吗  给你  就一会儿
Actually, you know what? Here, just for a second.

461
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,690
-什么  -小心点
- What?  - OK? Careful.

462
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:43,960
好的
Yeah, yeah.

463
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,700
好了  丹尼  我们走  
Okay, Danny, let's go.

464
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,680
-等等  -如果她饿了的话
- Wait.  - If she gets hungry,

465
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,180
奶瓶在这儿  明白吧  我们走
bottle in here. You got it? Let's go.

466
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,170
等等  我怎么会知道她饿没饿
Wait-- how am I supposed to know if she's hungry?

467
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,090
你会知道的  相信我  你会的
Oh, you'll know. Trust me, you'll know.

468
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,270
佐藤
Sato?

469
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,370
我不认识叫佐藤的人
I don't know any Sato.

470
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,050
你知道吗  对一个爱赌博的人来说
You know for somebody who likes to gamble,

471
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,070
你的"扑克脸"可装的不怎么样
you don't have a very good poker face.

472
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,920
你的名字叫黑田秀明
Your name is Hideaki Kuroda.

473
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,570
你帮佐藤洗钱
You're Sato's moneyman.

474
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,530
你有一个妻子
You have a wife.

475
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,190
两个孩子
You have two children.

476
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,490
萝西和金
Rosie and Kin.

477
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,440
萝西在钢琴上很有天赋
Now, Rosie, she's very talented at the piano.

478
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,960
而金  他的数学很好
And Kin, well, he aced math,

479
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,150
但他需要一个科学家教  对吗
but he needs a science tutor. Right?

480
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,950
还有  你刚买了
 Oh, and you just brought, um,

481
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,960
一辆崭新的跑车
a brand-new sports car.

482
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,840
给你的情妇
For your mistress.

483
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,070
目前为止  都说对了吧
So far, so good?

484
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,730
我还知道
I also know

485
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,880
你想脱离佐藤
that you want out of Sato's crew.

486
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,350
但你不能  因为你一直都在
But you can't because you've been gambling

487
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,770
用你老板的钱赌博
with your boss' money.

488
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,400
而且你一直在输钱
And you've been losing.

489
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,440
你想要掩盖这件事
Trying to cover it up,

490
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,470
把钱挪来挪去  拆东墙补西墙
moving the money around from place to place.

491
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,740
但这个漏洞
But that hole?

492
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,140
漏洞只是不断变大
Yeah, that hole just keeps getting deeper.

493
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,280
越来越大
And deeper.

494
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,460
既然我都知道了这些
Now if I know this,

495
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,730
那么佐藤发现这一切
Then really it's only a matter of time

496
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,560
只是时间问题
before Sato figures it out.

497
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,520
而且当他得知他拿不回钱
And when he realizes that he can't get his money back

498
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,210
是因为你把它们输光了
because you lost it

499
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,940
输在赌桌和赌马上
at blackjack and craps, and roulette and horses,

500
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,750
他会尽他所能  让你不得好死
he is gonna hurt you in the worst way that he can.

501
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,330
现在  我们能帮你
Now, we can help you,

502
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,040
秀明先生  但你必须先告诉我
Mr. Kuroda, but you first you got to tell me

503
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,710
佐藤在哪里
where I can find Sato.

504
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,210
你跟佐藤有什么过节
What business do you have with Sato?

505
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,480
我对佐藤一点兴趣都没有
I don't give a damn about Sato.

506
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,830
我只想问他
I just want to ask him

507
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,430
亚当・西村在哪里
where I can find Adam Noshimuri.

508
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,090
火奴鲁鲁动物园

509
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,090
火奴鲁鲁动物园

510
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,520
在这儿  就是这些储物柜
There it is. There are the lockers.

511
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,140
B-24柜
B-24.

512
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,380
你还觉得麦特是清白的吗
You still think Matt's not dirty?

513
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,330
五零特遣队总部

514
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,330
五零特遣队总部

515
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,960
我们找到了超过十万美元的现金
Okay. We got over a $100,000 cash.

516
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,450
解释给我听听  一个卧底警察
Explain to me how is it that

517
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,520
是怎么拿到这么多钱的
an undercover cop has this kind of money?

518
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,380
无法解释
I can't.

519
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,370
我没办法解释
Okay? I can't.

520
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,910
但这并不代表他手脚不干净
But that doesn't make him dirty.

521
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,910
史蒂夫  他把那个储物柜的钥匙
Steve, he had the key to that locker

522
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,630
藏在了浴室的出水口
hidden in a shower drain.

523
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,890
他不想任何人
He did not want anyone

524
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,660
发现这些现金  为什么
to see this cash-- why?

525
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,170
也许他被收买
Maybe he was getting paid

526
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,170
提供内幕消息
for inside information by the guys

527
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,290
给那些抢劫戴克的人
that were ripping off Dekker.

528
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,050
如果他是一个为了抓到戴克
That's a big maybe for a guy who put his wife

529
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,680
三年来把自己妻子和儿子的生命放在次位的人
and his son's lives on the backburner

530
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,920
这才有可能发生
for three years to take Dekker down.

531
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,340
千万别介意这股味道
Don't mind the smell.

532
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,780
哦  好吧  我懂了
Ooh! Yeah, I know.

533
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,860
豌豆糊
Strained peas.

534
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,510
还只消化了一半
Only partially digested.

535
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,550
给你  你能不能...
Here, could you, uh...?

536
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,790
-小宝贝  -谢谢
- Hey, hi. - Thanks.

537
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,410
你身上除了宝宝的呕吐物
Did you, uh, get anything

538
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,100
没再有别的吧
besides baby puke?

539
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,340
是啊  呵呵
Yeah. Funny.

540
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,620
我查了麦特和他老婆的信用卡记录
I ran the credit histories on Matt and his wife.

541
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,480
毫无异常  他们过得本本分分
Nothing unusual-- they live paycheck to paycheck

542
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,580
和岛上最诚实努力的好公仆无异
just like most honest hard-working civil servants on the island.

543
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,270
你能专注点么
Can we focus over here?

544
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,030
你们查了财务状况  没有异常
Yeah, you ran the finances, no surprises.

545
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,190
挺好  还有什么消息
Good, what else we got?

546
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,610
我查看了麦特的手机
I dumped Matt's phone.

547
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:58,370
唯一值得注意的的是
The only thing of note

548
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,630
他上周给当地房地产中介
was a series of phone calls

549
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,090
打了几个电话
to a local real estate agent all in the last week.

550
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,160
她叫切丽・特瑞顿
Name of Cherie Tranton.

551
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,120
房地产中介
Real estate agent?

552
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,370
你觉得奇怪吗
That seem strange to you?

553
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,510
也许是他房租涨价了
Maybe the lease is up on, uh, on his place.

554
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,150
对呀  也有可能他打算买房子
Ah, yeah, or maybe he was looking to buy some property

555
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,520
来洗黑钱
and launder some of this cash.

556
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,880
我去问问肯尼迪探员
I'll check in with Agent Kennedy.

557
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,240
看看他是不是知道钱
See if he knows anything about the money

558
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,110
或是房地产中介的事儿
or the real estate agent.

559
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,030
阿成  先等等
You know what, Chin? Hold off on that for now.

560
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,760
咱们先看看麦特的报告
Let's take a look at Matt's field reports first.

561
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,760
我现在还不想把ATF的人卷进来
I want to keep ATF out of the loop for now.

562
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,650
肯尼迪那儿有麦特的所有情报
Well, Kennedy had all the same intel Matt did. You know?

563
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,710
我明白了
 Oh, I see.

564
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,620
所以我觉得是麦特有问题
So I'm crazy, my-my theory is nuts

565
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,170
这个推测太离谱了
thinking that Matt went bad,

566
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,780
而你的新推测是
but your new amazing idea

567
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,140
麦特的联络人才是
is Matt's handler was the one

568
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,590
把消息泄露给袭击戴克的人
giving information to the guys that ripped off Dekker.

569
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,850
我只是说有这个可能  好不好
Well, I'm just saying it's possible, okay?

570
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,970
咱们都听到肯尼迪的誊写员怎么说的了
We all heard what Kennedy's transcriber said.

571
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,150
肯尼迪原本可以在几周前就可以
Kennedy could've pulled Matt out

572
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,750
让麦特撤离  结束这个案子的
and taken the case down weeks ago.

573
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,230
这也就能解释为什么肯尼迪
That would explain why Kennedy kept Matt

574
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,530
-这么长时间都不让麦特撤离了  -是的
- out in the field so long. - Right.

575
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,810
所以咱们还得仔细看看记录
So let's just take a closer look at the transcripts.

576
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,550
看看是不是漏掉了什么  好吗
See if we're missing anything. All right?

577
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,500
-这是在搞什么  -轮到你了
- What are we doing? - It's your turn.

578
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,600
轮到我干什么了
My turn for what?

579
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,400
咱们可是个团队啊
We're a team.

580
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,510
丹尼  每个人都得十一分投入
Danny, everybody's got to put in 110%.

581
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,620
看看  这就是十一分的投入
Look at this-- that's 110% right there.

582
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,160
我和阿成去和戴克谈谈
Chin and I, we're gonna go talk to Dekker

583
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,610
看看他能不能解释下这些钱
see if he can shed some light on this cash.

584
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,780
与此同时  当你看孩子的时候
In the meantime, while you're on babysitting duty,

585
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,500
再去查查这个房地产中介
run background on this real estate agent.

586
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,390
查查戴克的团伙
See if there's any connection

587
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,780
和切丽・特瑞顿有没有什么关系
between Dekker's crew and Cherie Tranton.

588
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,480
尽量别让宝宝的口水流到物证上
And try not to let her drool on the evidence.

589
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,730
咱们还有用呢
We're gonna need it.

590
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,580
小孩儿挺聪明啊  我有个想法
Smart kid. Uh, I got an idea.

591
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,180
要不然我为团队身先士卒
Uh, why don't I step up for the team and,

592
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,190
我和阿成去
uh, Chin and I will go out.

593
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,620
你留下来  打打电话  处理一下
You stay here, make those calls, and deal with, uh,

594
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,940
你这脏兮兮的侄女
your soiled niece here?

595
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,780
赶快给她换尿布
Change her soon.

596
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,500
你知道么  否则她会起疹子的
You understand? Or she gets a rash.

597
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,300
是么
Oh, does she?

598
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,710
尿布在史蒂夫的办公室里
Diaper bag's in Steve's office.

599
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,350
奶瓶在冰箱里
Bottles are in the fridge.

600
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,020
你会用得上的
You're gonna need that.

601
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,450
为什么这个会在
Why was this in a storage locker

602
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,140
你死去的朋友的储物柜里
belonging to your dead friend?

603
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,970
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

604
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,620
这儿有十万美金
There's a hundred grand in there.

605
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,620
你怎么知道的
How did you know that?

606
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,030
因为这是我给他的
'Cause I gave it to him.

607
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,400
布赖恩向我借钱
Bryan asked me for a loan.

608
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,380
说周末就能还给我
Said he'd get it back to me by the weekend.

609
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,530
等等  一个人找你借十万美金
Wait a minute-- a guy asks you for a hundred thousand dollars

610
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,740
你就这么随随便便借了
and you just give it to him?

611
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,850
是的  我相信我的朋友
Yeah, I trust my friends.

612
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,820
他要这些钱做什么
What he want the money for?

613
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,460
老兄  我从不细问
I don't ask for details, man.

614
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,660
你不能为了我不知道的事儿难为我
What I don't know won't put me in a box.

615
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,350
如果你没完没了
Now if you're done harassing me,

616
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,320
我去和警卫吃点小鱼玉米卷
I'm gonna get some fish tacos with my police escort.

617
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,800
如果麦特没偷这些钱
If Matt didn't steal that money...

618
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,090
这些钱就无法证明
Yeah, it throws some cold water

619
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,290
他不干净  戴克
on the theory that he was dirty. Hey, Dekker?

620
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,780
除非把钱拿回来  否则我没什么可说的
I'm done talking until I get my money back.

621
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,140
你是指这些给孤寡基金会的捐款吗
Oh, you mean this donation to the Widows and Orphans Fund?

622
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,790
你可真大方
That's very generous of you.

623
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,970
要不然你跟我们讲讲
Now, listen, why don't you tell me about this crew

624
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,960
那些抢劫你的人  他们是谁
that's been ripping you off-- who are they?

625
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,770
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

626
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,350
那些袭击你的人
Those guys that have been hitting you

627
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,000
很有可能就是杀了你朋友的人
are probably the guys that killed your friend.

628
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,090
那么我衷心的希望你能抓住他们
Well, then I sincerely hope you catch them.

629
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,270
好吧  听我说
Okay, listen to me.

630
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,490
我知道你最近经济上出了问题
I know you've been taking some big financial hits lately.

631
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,340
我想帮你一把
Okay? So I want to do you a favor.

632
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,140
我会增加警卫巡逻
I'm going to extend our police presence.

633
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,620
你和你身边的每一个人
You and everybody in your life

634
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,750
都会由火奴鲁鲁警局24小时全方位保护
is gonna be protected by HPD 24-seven.

635
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,420
确保你们的安全
Just to make sure you feel safe.

636
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,850
我们会日夜坚守
We're gonna have eyes on you day and night.

637
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,130
祝你进出口生意兴隆
Yeah, good luck in the import and export biz.

638
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,660
好好吃玉米卷吧
Enjoy your tacos.

639
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,410
等一下
Wait.

640
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,400
我知道些事  有可能对你们有用
I got something that might help.

641
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,140
这是一个室内的监视录像
This is an in-house surveillance video

642
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,870
记录了一个当地帮派被另一拨团伙突击
from a local gang getting ripped off by another crew.

643
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,410
箱子里是什么东西
What's in the crates?

644
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,260
枪支  毒品  还有一些派对套餐
Guns, drugs and other party favors.

645
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,480
我对那些戴面罩的人比较有兴趣
I'm more interested in the guys behind the masks.

646
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,580
有没有什么办法能查他们的身份  查理
Is there any way we can ID these guys,Charlie?

647
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,820
总会有办法的
There's always a way.

648
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,240
我有发现了就打给你
I'll call you when I got something.

649
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,520
好的  谢了  哥们
All right, thanks, buddy.

650
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,340
对了  查理
Hey, Charlie?

651
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,050
你回来真是太好了
It's good to have you back.

652
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:37,030
很久很久以前有个非常英俊的王子
Once upon a time there was a very handsome prince.

653
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,000
而且呢  这个英俊的王子
And this, uh, handsome prince

654
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,900
有匹漂亮的黑马
had a very beautiful black stallion.

655
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,490
王国中的所有人
And this black stallion was, uh, was admired

656
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,970
都对这匹马称赞有加
by everybody in the kingdom.

657
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,570
它跑得最快而且姿态优美
He was the fastest and fairest stallion in the land,

658
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:51,640
马力大概有528匹  反正是匹好马
about 528 horsepower, very nice stallion, anyway.

659
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,050
有一天
Uh, one day, uh,

660
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,830
英俊的王子...
this incredibly handsome prince...

661
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,320
是吧  他瞎了  我告诉你
Yeah, he was, he was out of sight, let me tell you.

662
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,770
他和一个很刻薄的食人怪搭档
He was partnered up with a mean ogre.

663
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,900
奇丑无比而且全身长满毛的食人怪
A disgusting, hairy ogre.

664
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,880
真算不上是天造之和
It was not a match made in heaven.

665
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,260
他们时不时会一起去宰几头龙
They would slay dragons together from time to time.

666
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,850
而且他们总在吵架  当然
And they'd argue all the time and, of course,

667
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,450
聪明的王子殿下总能  总能吵赢
the brilliant charming prince would-would win those arguments

668
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,830
因为食人怪是个笨蛋
because the ogre was a dope.

669
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,610
尽管他们有过这些战绩
Despite their, uh, victories,

670
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,620
但他们之间总是有着若隐若现的矛盾
there was a dark cloud that loomed.

671
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,760
因为...
Because...

672
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,640
那个笨蛋食人怪
the dopey ogre coveted

673
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,870
对王子的好马垂涎已久
the handsome prince's stallion, okay?

674
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,810
他是个非常贪婪自私的食人怪
And he was a very greedy, selfish ogre

675
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,490
控制欲还很强
with-with major control issues.

676
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:32,630
从不让英俊的王子殿下骑自己的马
And he would never let the handsome prince ride his own stallion.

677
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,220
等等  我们得先接个电话
Hold on, we're gonna pick this up in a second.

678
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,050
很好  房地产中介打来了
Oh good, it's the real estate agent.

679
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:39,940
您好
Hello.

680
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,200
是的  我是
Yes, yes it is.

681
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,900
那太好了
Uh, that's perfect.

682
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,080
我可以在那里跟你见面
I can, uh, I can meet you there.

683
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,910
地址是什么
What's, uh, what's the address?

684
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,390
真快啊
That was fast.

685
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,330
得补偿错过的时间啊  来看看
Making up for lost time. Check it out.

686
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,580
我截取到了其中一人的清晰图像
I got a clean screen capture on one of your guys.

687
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,910
我们可以用来估计身高
We can estimate height,

688
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,170
体重  鞋码
weight, shoe size.

689
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,650
如果据此在火奴鲁鲁警局数据库里搜索
If we run those traits through the HPD arrest database?

690
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,890
我们就可以对上号
We're gonna get dozens of matches

691
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,240
-并找到很多嫌疑人  -但是
- and then lots of possible suspects. - But...

692
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,040
如果我们测量瞳距的话
if we measure pupillary distance,

693
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,470
这个人的瞳距是63.2毫米
which in this case is 63.2 millimeters,

694
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,670
然后结合其他线索
and we combine it with all of the other traits,

695
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,010
就能有效缩小搜索范围
it narrows the field considerably.

696
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,530
你好啊  乔伊・提勒曼
Aloha, Joey Tillman.

697
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,680
看看他做过什么  抢劫  持枪
Okay, what do we got? Robbery, guns,

698
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,360
故意伤人  屡次抢劫  就是他了
assault, more robbery. This has to be our guy.

699
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,530
特警队在来的路上了
You know, SWAT's on its way.

700
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,760
也许没必要问这个
Maybe I don't need to ask this,

701
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,940
不过我们要不要等等他们
but should we wait?

702
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,350
我也是这么想的
That's what I thought.

703
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:37,530
掩护
Cover!

704
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,380
看来有三名射手
Looks like we got three shooters.

705
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,780
这些人是靠走私武器谋生的
These guy move weapons for a living.

706
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,300
肯定从头武装到牙齿
They're gonna be armed to the teeth.

707
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,620
我们得等后援
We're gonna need more guns.

708
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,990
你们应该等特警队来了再行动的
You should've waited for SWAT.

709
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,570
你真的打算现在讨论这个问题吗
You really want to do this now?

710
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,040
停火
Hold fire!

711
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,380
这里是火奴鲁鲁警局特警队
This is HPD SWAT!

712
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,420
放下武器  出来投降
Drop your weapons and come out.

713
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,710
你们已经被包围
You are outnumbered.

714
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,600
这是唯一一次警告
This is your one warning.

715
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,620
是提勒曼
That's Tillman.

716
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,590
挪开
Move it.

717
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,100
安全
Clear!

718
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,180
-安全  -伙计
- Clear! - Hey, yo.

719
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,030
来看看这个
You'll want to come take a look at this.

720
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,080
跟监控录像里的板条箱是一样的
Same crates we saw in the surveillance videos.

721
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,150
他们肯定就是抢了戴克的那伙人
These have got to be the guys that've been ripping off Dekker.

722
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,600
我们马上发通缉令吧
All right, let's get an alert out right away.

723
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,030
我记得你说过有三个射手
I thought you said there were three shooters.

724
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,210
确实是  第三个人肯定从后面偷溜了
There were. Third guy must've slipped out the back.

725
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,630
他是从后面偷溜的啊
Oh, he slipped out the back.

726
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,150
还真是干得漂亮啊  少校
Well, that's exemplary work, Commander.

727
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,520
史蒂夫
Steve.

728
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,740
看看这个
Take a look at this.

729
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,610
伤口是在后脑
Entry wound's in the back of the head.

730
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,960
这些人不是我们杀的
We didn't kill these guys.

731
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,830
是那第三个射手干的
The third shooter did.

732
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,640
那个在你眼皮底下溜走的家伙吗
Oh, you mean the guy that escaped on your watch?

733
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,430
在我的眼皮底下
On my watch?

734
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,330
交火的时候你可就在我旁边
You were standing right next to me when this went down.

735
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,680
这事本来不会发生
See, it wouldn't have gone down

736
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,910
如果你们稍微再等一等
if you just waited a little bit

737
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,330
让特警队来处理的话
and let SWAT do its job.

738
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,610
不过  就如我刚才所说
But, hey, like I said,

739
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,560
干得漂亮啊  上校
exemplary work, Commander.

740
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,000
他为什么要杀自己的人呢
So why does he shoot his own guys?

741
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,900
可能是想收拾掉所有走漏风声的人吧
Well, maybe he's tying up loose ends.

742
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,920
而这也可能也是谋杀麦特的动机
Which could be the same motive for killing Matt.

743
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,360
这第三个射手也许知道了
Maybe this third shooter knew

744
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,640
麦特快查到所有参与作案的人了
that Matt was getting close to the crew.

745
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,160
我们得知道  麦特要这些钱来做什么
We need to work out what Matt wanted that money for.

746
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,900
全新建筑
All new construction,

747
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,740
刚换上的新毛毯
brand-new carpeting,

748
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,350
特别设计的石英工作台
engineered quartz countertops.

749
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,800
而且这附近还有个很棒的学校小区
And there's a great school district

750
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,370
等你的小女孩长大了就正好合适
for your little girl, when she's ready.

751
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,970
不  谢谢你的好意
Oh, no, that's, uh... that's very nice.

752
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,190
她其实
She's, uh... she's actually

753
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,420
是我朋友的孩子  我只是临时照看她
a friend of mine's. I'm just babysitting.

754
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,660
我  我还单身
I'm, uh... I'm single.

755
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,190
天  好吧
Oh, my. Well...

756
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,550
能认识这么一个有爱心的人真好
So refreshing to meet somebody who's so... giving.

757
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,190
你肯定是个很热心的人
You must be a very warm person.

758
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,140
你还非常结实
And you're so fit.

759
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,650
谢谢称赞
Oh, thank you very much.

760
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:42,750
我就是特别欣赏把裤子穿得好看的男人
I just appreciate a man who can wear a pair of pants.

761
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,350
好吧  这房子设计很不错
Okay. Well... Now, this condo's got a great layout.

762
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,500
尽管只有一间卧室
Although... there's only one bedroom.

763
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,230
眨眼
Wink.

764
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,850
看  她说眨眨眼
Look at that. She said "Wink, wink,"

765
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:52,990
然后她就眨眼了
and then she winked.

766
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,250
-告诉我  -什么
- So tell me... - Huh?

767
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,920
是什么风
...what winds of fortune

768
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,970
把你这只小船吹来我这里来的
have blown your little ship into my harbor?

769
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,100
是麦特・赫钦斯
Oh, um... Matt Hutchins,

770
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,350
向我推荐了你的
actually recommended you.

771
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,870
赫钦斯先生
Mr. Hutchins!

772
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,570
他为你租下了这间公寓
Oh, did he rent the apartment for you?

773
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,700
是的
Yes, he did.

774
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,790
我不得不说
I have to say,

775
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,630
这种情况我还是第一次碰到
this was a first for me.

776
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,780
我见过很多人只是来看看
I mean, I have people who come and want to window shop,

777
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,870
但从没有人到这来  就租一天
but I've never had someone want to rent a condo for just one day.

778
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,060
是啊  就租一天
Well, uh, yeah, one day.

779
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,940
我们只需要一天就够了
That's all we need it for.

780
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,960
就今天  所以我们来了
Today's that day, so here we are.

781
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,330
是明天  小笨蛋
Tomorrow, silly.

782
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,680
对  对  是明天
Tomorrow, yes, of course.

783
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,260
我的意思就是明天
Tomorrow's that day, that's what I meant.

784
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,920
你知道  对这一千块
You know, for $1,000,

785
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,450
你们两个肯定有精心设计的安排
you boys must have something scintillating planned,

786
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:32,200
所以你最好把切丽的号码存着
so you better keep Cherie's number in your phone.

787
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:35,530
房东协会可不喜欢我们这种小交易
Homeowner's association doesn't like little side deals like this,

788
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,090
所以这是我们两个人的小秘密  知道吗
so it's our little secret, okay?

789
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,860
当然  切丽  你还真淘气
All right. Cherie, you're very naughty.

790
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,710
亲爱的  你猜不透我的
Honey... you have no idea.

791
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,790
你一定爱这里的风景
You are gonna love this view.

792
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,670
太棒了
Wow, very nice.

793
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,090
史蒂夫
Hey, Steve.

794
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,110
我有东西要让你看  快过来
Something you gotta see. Come down here.

795
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,860
看起来麦特在监视那个
It seems like Matt was running surveillance

796
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,810
我们发现了钱的柜子
on the lockers where we found the money.

797
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,810
我说  如果你要让宝宝晒到太阳
You know what, if you're gonna hold the baby in the sun, okay,

798
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,130
你跟我说  我会给她戴上太阳帽的
just ask me and I'll put a sunhat on her.

799
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:14,930
但现在的问题是
You know what, though? The question is,

800
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,540
为什么他要监视那个柜子
why would he be doing surveillance on the lockers?

801
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,180
麦特记录了所有戴克的武器交易
Okay, Matt recorded all the times and dates

802
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,930
时间和地点  是不是
of Dekker's weapons transactions. Right?

803
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,900
那帮抢劫戴克的人也有所有信息
The crew that was ripping Dekker off had all that information.

804
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,450
你是说  麦特认为某个ATF内部的人
Are you thinking that Matt thought

805
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,400
泄露了这些信息
that someone in the ATF leaked it?

806
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,760
我觉得他在调查
I think he was building a case.

807
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,840
他本可以借走戴克的那些钱
I mean, he could have borrowed the money off of Dekker,

808
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,320
把钱放在柜子里
planted it in the lockers

809
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,500
抓出那个泄露情报的人
to set up whoever was leaking that information.

810
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,290
如果是那样
If that were the case,

811
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,930
他会在报告里误报一些信息
he would have planted the misinformation in one of his reports.

812
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
看这个
Now look at this.

813
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,200
这个火奴鲁鲁动物园的入口就是放钱的地方
Here's an entry about the money drop at Honolulu Zoo.

814
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,280
计划明天上午九点把钱放在那里
Set to be dropped off at 9:00 a.m.,

815
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,860
十一点拿走
picked up at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

816
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,250
所以钱有两个小时的空挡被偷走
All right, that's a two hour window for the money to be stolen.

817
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,190
我们是对的
Yep, we were right.

818
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,040
麦特在给某个ATF的内鬼下套
Matt was setting someone up at the ATF.

819
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,060
肯尼迪
Kennedy.

820
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,050
他可能把戴克的交易信息
He could have been selling information to Tillman

821
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,060
卖给提勒曼
about Dekker's operation.

822
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,160
所以让麦特一直卧底  不展开行动
That's why he kept the case open and Matt undercover for so long.

823
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,230
他自己有好处
He was onto a good thing,

824
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,470
当然不想事情这么快了结
he didn't want it to end.

825
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,160
他让自己置身事外  却拿着大笔钱
Well, he keeps his hands clean, and he gets a cut of the profits.

826
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,990
当肯尼迪发现麦特识破了这些
And then when he found out that Matt was on to him,

827
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,590
就找了提勒曼的手下杀了他
Kennedy got one of Tillman's guys to kill him.

828
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,410
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

829
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:14,390
我要去完成麦特没完成的
I'm going to finish what Matt started.

830
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,550
你也来吗
You want to come?

831
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:16,880
行动
Let's do it.

832
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,690
听清楚了
All right, so listen up.

833
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,220
不管是谁  那人一打开柜子拿到钱就抓住他
Grab whoever picks up this money the second they open the locker.

834
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,260
我要这地方完全封锁起来
I want this entire place locked down.

835
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,380
每个出入口都有人把守
I want men on every exit,

836
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,470
周围每隔三十码就有两个人驻守
and I want two men every 30 yards around the perimeter.

837
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,290
开始行动
Let's go.

838
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:37,660
我不会这么做
I wouldn't have done it this way.

839
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,000
是吗
Yeah, you don't say?

840
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,910
麦格瑞特  我们应该等等
McGarrett, we should wait.

841
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,800
火奴鲁鲁动物园

842
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,790
等嫌疑人离开公园的时候你捉住他
Let your suspect exit the zoo, then you take him down.

843
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,680
那样我们就不用在这些人群之中
That way, we don't get into a firefight

844
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,360
开枪交战了
in the middle of all these civilians.

845
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,000
我想确保周围安全
I want to secure the perimeter.

846
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,740
好吗  他这次不会逃走了
Okay? He's not going to escape this time.

847
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,910
如果你上次能等特警来
He wouldn't have escaped last time

848
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,540
他上次就被抓住了
if you'd have just waited for SWAT.

849
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,510
如果我等特警来我可能已经死掉了
I could've been dead if I waited for SWAT.

850
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,980
或许是  但事情总有好坏两种方法
Maybe. But there's a right way and a wrong way to do things.

851
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,590
你不喜欢我  我知道了
You don't like me. All right? I get that.

852
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,810
但这次行动我是指挥
But I'm in command and control of this operation.

853
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,240
我是队长  明白吗
I'm also the team leader, okay?

854
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,490
所以你和你的团队
So you and your team,

855
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:09,000
你们要么和我联手  要么退出
you can come aboard with us or you can stand down.

856
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,960
你说了算
Whatever you say, uh...

857
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,060
少校
Commander.

858
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,670
科莫多巨蜥  夏威夷黄颈黑雁

859
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:28,790
没有发现
Nothing.

860
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,480
你记得把奶瓶给琼了吗
Did you remember to give Joan her bottle?

861
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,050
当然
Of course I did.

862
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,010
你在和麦克斯发消息是不是
You're texting Max right now, aren't you?

863
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:37,200
我没有
No, I'm not.

864
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,230
现在给琼喂奶

865
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,540
你真不会撒谎
You're a terrible liar.

866
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,510
有发现了
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I got something.

867
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,440
黑色连帽衫  径直前进
Black hoodie, straight ahead.

868
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,920
走得很快  直奔柜子
Moving fast, heading straight for the lockers.

869
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,490
不准动
Hold it right there.

870
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,580
怎么这么久
Took you long enough.

871
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,630
路上堵
Traffic.

872
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,220
不许动
Don't move a muscle.

873
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,330
为什么
Why?

874
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,120
看看这里  琳达
Take a look around, Linda.

875
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,050
看看你自己现在在哪里
Look at where you are.

876
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:34,860
看到这间屋子了吗
You see this room?

877
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,180
我们不是随便把你抓来的
You don't get to this room by accident.

878
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,190
都结束了
It's over.

879
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,000
我们知道你一直在把麦特的情报
We know you were feeding Matt's intel

880
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,540
交给你的这位男朋友
to your boyfriend here.

881
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,510
我们还知道  通过那些信息
And we know that with that information,

882
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,650
他和两个同伙
he and two of his associates

883
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:48,110
能够有组织地清除戴克的手下
were able to systematically rip off Dekker's crew.

884
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,830
昨天  这个人
Yesterday, this guy right here,

885
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,500
他将两个同伙爆头枪杀
he put two bullets in the back of their heads

886
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,010
以确保他们不会泄密
to make sure they kept quiet.

887
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,010
谁能保证
Now, who's to say

888
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,180
你拿到钱之后
he wouldn't have done the same thing to you

889
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,700
他会不会对你做出同样的事
after you collected that money?

890
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,380
麦特信任我们
Matt trusted us.

891
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,930
不  我们是他仅有的生机
No, we were his lifeline.

892
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,360
而你却背叛了他
And y-you betrayed him.

893
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,760
为了什么  钱吗
For what? Money?

894
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,000
不是
No.

895
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,600
我们只是不想进监狱
We just didn't want to go to jail.

896
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,770
闭嘴  琳达
Shut up, Linda!

897
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,680
你给我说清楚
You make me understand.

898
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,780
为什么要杀他
Why'd you have to kill him?

899
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,690
麦特几周前打来电话
Matt called a few weeks ago.

900
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:25,090
他想知道  谁有权限看到他的报告
He wanted to know who had access to his transcripts.

901
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,590
他怀疑报告被泄露了出去
He suspected that his reports had been compromised.

902
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,580
他查到我们只是时间的问题
It was only a matter of time until he traced that back to us.

903
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,610
对不起
I'm... sorry.

904
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,490
真的...
I'm...

905
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,110
对不起
so sorry.

906
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,590
问完了吗
You done here?

907
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,400
现在完事了
Now I am.

908
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,330
也许我该早点结束麦特的任务
Maybe I should've... pulled Matt out.

909
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,580
要是我能早点决定动手的话...
You know, if I-I'd just pushed the button sooner...

910
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,060
现在动手也不迟
What say we go push it now?

911
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,510
什么情况
What the hell is this?

912
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,430
我给你的录像里没有能定我罪的东西
There was nothing incriminating on that tape I gave you.

913
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,470
我的钱呢
Where's my money?

914
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,590
你的钱呢
Where's your money?

915
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,260
好消息是  我们找到了你的钱和枪
Good news is, we got your money and your guns.

916
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,810
坏消息是  我们拿走了你的钱和枪
Bad news is, we got your money and your guns.

917
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,750
艾莉森  你该看看这个
Allison, there's something you need to see.

918
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,470
给小麦特
爸爸

919
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,090
你好  小麦特
Hey, Matty.

920
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,080
我总是在想  你会长成什么样的男人
You know, I often dream about the kind of man you'll become...

921
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,850
有力量  有勇气  还有判别是非的能力
your strength and courage, your sense of right and wrong.

922
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:48,460
爸爸想要教给你的东西
There are so many things

923
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,130
实在是太多太多
a father wants to teach his son,

924
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,850
有时候需要言传身教
and sometimes you gotta teach by example.

925
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,690
通过接受这个任务
In accepting this assignment,

926
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,850
我希望能将这个世界变成一个
I hope I've helped make this world the kind of place

927
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,520
让你能够茁壮成长的地方
you deserve to grow up in.

928
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,850
儿子  人生中有很多艰难的抉择
Son, there's always hard choices in life,

929
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,460
牺牲在所难免
sacrifices that need to be made.

930
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,830
我想让你明白
I just want you to know Daddy made this one

931
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,970
爸爸因为爱你和妈妈才会做此选择
out of the love I have for you and your mother.

932
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,390
替我照顾好妈妈  孩子
You take care of her, kid.

933
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,150
你现在是家里的顶梁柱了
You're the man of the house now.

934
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,570
给你
There we go.

935
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,080
接着
Come on.

936
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,950
没有磕碰刮伤
Aw, no dings or scratches.

937
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:38,120
史蒂夫舅舅真称职
Looks like Uncle Steve did a good job.

938
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,450
有工作就要做好  仅此而已
I had a job to do, I did it. That's all.

939
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,030
承认吧  你也乐在其中
Oh, admit it. You had a little bit of fun.

940
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,240
我看出来了
I just saw you.

941
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,620
我是真的乐在其中
I-I definitely had a lot of fun.

942
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,960
她是个好孩子  玛丽
Yeah, she's a great kid, Mary.

943
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,710
谢谢你们
Aw, thank you.

944
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,860
下次再需要看孩子的话  我会联系你俩的
Well, next time I need a sitter I'll call on you two.

945
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,610
先让我说两句
Excuse me for a minute here, please.

946
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,440
没错  我们都出了力
Yes, we all contributed, but I was

947
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,520
但我得说  我是主力
primary on this one, I'd like to say.

948
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,950
好的  硬汉
Okay, tough guy.

949
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,180
跟叔叔们再见
Say goodbye to your uncles!

950
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,720
你要去哪  你不需要
Where-where you going? You don't... what?

951
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,230
你不用急着走
You don't need to rush off, do you?

952
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,330
再待一会吧
Just stick around for a bit.

953
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:06,010
我们刚结了案
Yeah, we just, uh, wrapped up this case.

954
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,230
接下来也没事了  我们可以
We got nothing on the board, so we could...

955
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,890
-一起吃个饭什么的  -没错
- Go out and get a bite to eat? - Right.

956
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,480
吃点儿豌豆糊
Got plenty of strained peas.

957
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,370
抱歉  我们要
Sorry, but we have

958
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,380
十分钟后要去图书馆参加婴儿故事角
Bouncy Baby Story Time at the library in ten minutes.

959
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,940
-跟史蒂夫舅舅再见  -再见
- So say, bye, uncle Steve! - Bye...
