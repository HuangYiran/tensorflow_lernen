He knows how old we are, no?

443
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,721
走吧 
Come on.

444

Let me look at you.

447
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,608
不要紧 没事的 没事的
It's all right. You're fine.

448
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,193
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

449
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,695
杰克 
Jack.

450
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,614
你冷静下来 尤里 你不会有事的 
Calm down, Yuri, okay? You're gonna be just fine.

451
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,575
来 穿上这个 穿上这个 暖和一点
Here, put this on, stay warm.

452
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,205
这算什么 五分钟 
What was that, John? Five minutes? Five minutes?

453
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,081
- 你用五分钟就毁了我们三年的行动 - 不用谢 
- You blew a three-year op in five minutes! You're welcome! 

454
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,541
别客气 我还能怎么办  
You're welcome! What do you want me to do?

455
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,129
我怎么 这么倒霉
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

456
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,382
我的身份暴露了 我在这儿一个朋友都没了
I'm so fucking burned. I got no friends in this town anymore.

457
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,385
你们中情局的人呢 联系他们
What about your people at Langley? Just give them a call.

458
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,805

Give me your phone.

459

(PHONE SHATTERS)

460
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,731
我预付了两年的话费
It's a two-year contract on that phone.

461
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,067
那是什么 快给我
What are you carrying? Give me that.

462
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,695
行了 你有现金吗
All right. You got any cash on you?

463
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,365
有点儿美金
Some American money.

464
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,951
你们在磨蹭什么 我们得赶快走
What are you talking about? We need to keep on moving.

465
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,746
我们得给那家伙找个医生 帮他处理伤口 杰克
We have to get this guy to a doctor. To medical attention, Jack.

466
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:53,914
任务仍然有效
The mission stands.

467
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,458
你的任务都快流血过多而死了
Your mission is bleeding out over there.

468
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,752
继续执行任务 去酒店拿钥匙
The mission continues. We go to the hotel.

469
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,134
来吧 我们走 快走 快
Come on, let's move. Let's move.Come on

470
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,939
这也太扯了
This is nuts.

471
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:20,816
你现在要出去杀人
What, are you going to go out and kill somebody else now?

472
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,734
干嘛为一个人这么兴师动众
Why all this trouble for just one guy?

473
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,653
他是政治犯
He's a political prisoner.

474
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:26,321
约翰 虽然你不在乎
Not that you care, John,

475
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,782
可这关系到国家安全 懂吗
but it's a matter of national security, all right?

476
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,411
他有证据能扳倒查克林 我们需要他
He's got the goods to stop Viktor Chagarin, and we need that to happen.

477
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:33,620
噢 这样的话 
Well, great, Jack.

478
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,664
送他去大使馆不就行了
Let's drop him off at the Embassy, and we can go home.

479
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,333
开什么玩笑 安全屋都出事了
Are you kidding me? After what happened at the safe house?

480
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,003
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,483
事情没那么简单
Look, it doesn't work like that, all right?

481
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,171
这是个外交烂摊子 我不过是炮灰
It's a huge diplomatic mess, and I'm a burnable asset.

482
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,133
我要拿到那份文件 才能完成任务 
So, I now need that file to un-fuck this mission.

483
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,426
还有问题吗
Any more questions?

484
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,011
有 就一个 
Yeah, just one.

485
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,305
为什么从来不告诉我你的下落
How come you never called and told me where you were?

486
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,473
好像你关心似的
Like you'd give a shit.

487
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,784
Shit.

488
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,120
Well , we're not going in the front door.

489
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,257
行了 慢点 慢点
All right, hold up, hold up.

490
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,348
好了 尤里 你听我说 就快搞定了 知道吗
Okay, Yuri, listen to me, all right? We're almost done.

491
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,017
我们一拿到钥匙 就去取文件
As soon as we get that key, we're gonna grab the file,

492
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,227
然后带你离开俄罗斯 懂吗
get you and your daughter out of Russia, all right?

493
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,687
好的
All right.

494
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:45,859
好的 听我说 你表现很好 挺住
Listen to me, you're doing good. All right?

495
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,278
再坚持一会儿 看着他 约翰
I need you to hang here a second. 
Keep an eye on him, John.

496
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,571
嗨 嗨
Hey, hey.

497
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:53,367
唉 别一口一个约翰的 怎么不叫我爸爸
What is it with all this "John" shit?
Whatever happened to "Dad?"

498
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,702
问得好
Good question.

499
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,583
俄语里有个词形容他这种男人

柯鲁托伊
<i>"Krutoi."</i>

意思是 凶悍 顽强
It means "tough," "hard."

502
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,468
他这样的叫不良少年
In America, it means "juvenile delinquent."

503
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,639
你就这一个孩子
Is he your only child?

504
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:20,060
不 我还有个女儿
No. I got a daughter, too.

你呢

我只有一个宝贝女儿
I have only my  <i>Solnyschka.</i>

507
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,990
她小的时候 我一直在忙工作
When she was little, I was working all the time.

508
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,910
我认为工作是最重要的
I believed work was all that mattered.

509
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,835
我也没好好照顾孩子
I screwed my kid's life up, too.

510
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,086
我没日没夜地工作 
You work all the time

511
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,089
可警察没什么休息时间
around the clock most of the time, when you're a cop.

512
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:54,928
我那时觉得拼命工作是件 是件好事 对吗
I just thought that working all the time was a good thing, you know?

513
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,436
我完全没照顾到他
I didn't help him at all.

514
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,441
你还有机会
It's never too late,

515
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,943
但愿如此
I hope.

行了 我们走
Okay, let's go.

517
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,835
尤里 宴会厅在酒店的哪个区域
All right, Yuri, which part of the building is the ballroom in?

518
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:27,961
在主楼里
Main tower.

519
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,671

Main tower. Which floor?

顶层
Top floor.

521
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:33,592
保安方面呢 
What about security?

522
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,510
你记得保安 摄像头之类的吗
You remember any guards? Cameras? Anything like that?

523
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,554
我不知道
I don't know.

524
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,222
你 你得想起来
Well, I need you to remember.

525
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,391
我在牢里关了五年 怎么会记得
I was in prison for five years, how should I know?

526
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,351
可能都变了
Everything could have changed. I know.

527
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,188
是的 我知道 麻烦你好好回忆一下
Just think, all right? Picture it in your head.

528
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,982
宴会厅在89年关闭 
The ballroom was closed in '89.

529
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,151
现在可能在重新施工
I think it's under construction now.

530
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,903
所以那层楼没保安
So that floor's unsecured.

531
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,363
我不知道 听着 我女儿在里面 
I don't know! Listen! My daughter is in there.

532
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:56,698
我都害怕死了 快走吧
I'm scared to death, let's go!

01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:14,515
前进速度已经调到最大
<i>I've got full forward cyclic.</i>

1021
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:47,005
我要失去控制了
<i>I can't hold it.</i>

1022
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:50,968
我的天呐
Jesus Christ!

1023
01:29:56,683 --> 01:29:57,683
干得好
Well done,

1024
01:29:58,309 --> 01:29:59,893
超级间谍
Mr. Super-spy.

1025
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:06,483
可惜你爸没法活着看到你升官了
What a shame your father won't be alive to see you promoted.

1026
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:07,568
(LAUGHING)

1027
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:09,403
你也一样
Neither will you.

1028
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:20,164
(SCREAMS)

1029
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,628
嗨 杰克
Hey! Jack!

1030
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,716
坚持住 约翰
Hang on, John!

1031
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:40,142
(YELLS)

1032
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,029
(SHOUTING IN RUSSIAN)

1033
01:31:08,379 --> 01:31:09,588
约翰
John!

1034
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:16,678
快走
Come on!

1035
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:26,688
我们没有弹药了
<i>We're out of ammunition!</i>

1036
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:28,106
妈的
<i>Shit.</i>

1037
01:31:29,108 --> 01:31:29,983
狗杂种
<i>Bastards.</i>

1038
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,236
你他妈的要干什么
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

1039
01:31:35,114 --> 01:31:35,948
我来为你报仇 爸爸
<i>This is for you, papa.</i>

1040
01:32:40,013 --> 01:32:47,352
John !

1041
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:54,901
(GASPING)

1042
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:55,986
John !

1043
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:02,075
Dad !

1044
01:33:04,454 --> 01:33:05,454
我在这儿
Right here.

1045
01:33:32,774 --> 01:33:34,358
你刚才叫我爸爸
Did you just call me Dad?

1046
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:37,194
没有
No.

1047
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:40,197
我想也是
I didn't think so.

1048
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:43,533
你幻听了
You're hearing things.

1049
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:47,204
耳朵进水了吧
You got swimmer's ear.

1050
01:33:56,255 --> 01:33:59,257
我们不会多长出个手臂什么的吧
We're not gonna grow any third arms or anything, are we?

1051
01:33:59,425 --> 01:34:00,592
不会
No.

1052
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:02,803
不过你可能会秃头
You might lose your hair.

1053
01:34:03,429 --> 01:34:04,554
你就笑吧
Laugh it up, kid.

1054
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:07,724
再过五年你也会这样
This is you, five years from now.

1055
01:34:08,226 --> 01:34:10,227
那是雨水 没事的
It's rainwater. You'll be fine.

1056
01:34:10,394 --> 01:34:13,563
再说了 麦克莱恩家的人没那么容易死
Besides, it's hard to kill a McClane.

1057
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:16,942
你是麦克莱恩家的人
Now you're a McClane?

1058
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:20,403
对 我是麦克莱恩家的人 约翰·麦克莱恩
Yeah, I'm a McClane. John McClane.

1059
01:34:20,571 --> 01:34:22,072
小约翰·麦克莱恩
John McClane Junior.

1060
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:25,534
噢 那你就是老约翰了
Well, that makes you a "senior."

1061
01:34:25,701 --> 01:34:27,202
没错
That's right.

1062
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,912
可别忘了 
Try not to forget it.

1063
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,747
我是你爸爸
I'm your father.

1064
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:34,918
你得学会尊重长辈
Have some respect for your father.

1065
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,087
我问你件事
Let me ask you something.

1066
01:34:39,132 --> 01:34:41,258
是你爱找麻烦 
Do you go looking for trouble

1067
01:34:41,425 --> 01:34:43,552
还是麻烦总是 来找你
or does it always just seem to find you?

1068
01:34:45,638 --> 01:34:48,598
知道吗 这么多年了
You know, after all these years,

1069
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:52,227
我自己也没想明白过
I still ask myself the same question.

1070
01:34:55,303 --> 01:35:30,095
