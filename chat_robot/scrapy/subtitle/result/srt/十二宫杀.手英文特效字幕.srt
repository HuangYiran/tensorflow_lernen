{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know this used to be the town of Monticello?

219
00:18:02,663 --> 00:18:07,191
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But at some point, the county decided that the land would work better as a lake...

220
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:09,199
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so they flooded it.

221
00:18:10,404 --> 00:18:14,204
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-But there's an entire...\n-Hidden city under the water.

222
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,503
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We were here last spring, remember?\n-Oh, yeah.

223
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:27,451
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Somebody else is here.\n-It is a public park.

224
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:32,419
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think he's watching us.

225
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:34,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we're very good-looking.

226
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:42,398
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where'd he go?

227
00:18:45,006 --> 00:18:48,965
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He went behind that tree.\n-All right, so he's taking a leak.

228
00:18:55,716 --> 00:18:57,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's coming towards us.

229
00:18:59,854 --> 00:19:01,412
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God, he has a gun.

230
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:04,149
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't move.

231
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:07,226
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I want your money and your car keys.\n-Okay.

232
00:19:07,662 --> 00:19:09,323
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not gonna do anything, okay?

233
00:19:09,497 --> 00:19:12,591
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna cooperate. Just tell me what you want us to do.

234
00:19:16,737 --> 00:19:18,295
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here.

235
00:19:20,174 --> 00:19:22,665
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're welcome to everything I have.

236
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,774
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If there's anything else I could do for you...?

237
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,975
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe I could write you a check?

238
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:35,781
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I could give you my phone number.

239
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,188
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I might be able to help you...

240
00:19:40,228 --> 00:19:44,164
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-...even more than you might think.\n-He's a sociology major.

241
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:49,002
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prelaw, actually.

242
00:19:50,171 --> 00:19:53,868
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, keys. You know, I'm sorry. I don't know exactly where I put my keys.

243
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,942
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They might be on the blanket. Is it okay...?

244
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:03,249
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's the keys.

245
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:08,378
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't get up. I want her to tie you up.

246
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,387
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

247
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:36,844
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, if he comes any closer I might be able to get that gun.

248
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:39,111
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Don't get any ideas.\n-I'm not.

249
00:20:39,287 --> 00:20:41,847
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I killed a guard escaping from prison in Montana.

250
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:43,854
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not doing anything, okay?

251
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not afraid to kill again.

252
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:49,455
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look away.

253
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:58,264
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was the name of that prison?

254
00:21:02,543 --> 00:21:04,943
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, you said it was in Montana, right?

255
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm taking your car and going to Mexico.

256
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:12,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We didn't complain when you tied our hands.

257
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:16,245
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, you have everything that I have. We have done everything that you've asked.

258
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:18,323
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. It's okay.

259
00:21:18,492 --> 00:21:20,926
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She tied you loose, didn't she?

260
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:26,163
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get on your stomach so I can tie your feet.

261
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:30,794
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. It gets really cold out here at night. We could freeze.

262
00:21:38,846 --> 00:21:40,279
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, you all done?

263
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:46,519
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, just because people are gonna ask, was that thing even loaded?

264
00:21:57,298 --> 00:22:00,165
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. This is all gonna be okay.

265
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:33,825
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dispatch, this is 43L2, heading south on Knoxville Road.

266
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:36,469
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got an abandoned white vW Karmann Ghia.

267
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:45,969


268
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:48,206


269

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Napa Police Department.

270
00:22:53,988 --> 00:22:59,119
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to report a murder. No, a double murder.

271
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,127
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They are two miles north of park headquarters.

272
00:23:03,297 --> 00:23:07,393
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were in a white volkswagen Karmann Ghia.

273
00:23:08,335 --> 00:23:10,303
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the one that did it.

274
00:23:10,504 --> 00:23:15,203
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}43L2 has a male victim with him. Piner's ambulance has been dispatched.

275
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:18,304
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boy lived, the girl didn't. Again.

276
00:23:18,512 --> 00:23:22,073
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you imagine surviving that? Writing the dates on the side of the car.

277
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:25,685
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got two Vallejo killings, now there's one in Napa. Why Napa?

278
00:23:25,853 --> 00:23:29,016
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell is he doing out of Vallejo? Sweet mother of Christ...

279
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,021
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...what are you drawing?

280
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:34,286
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kid at the lake? This is what he said the Zodiac was wearing.

281
00:23:34,462 --> 00:23:37,056
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-My God, that's a hell of a getup.\n-What are you doing?

282
00:23:37,231 --> 00:23:40,166
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hyman, I wrote it. It's done. Now I just gotta type it up.

283
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:43,428
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not finished until you type it up. We've gotta read it.

284
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What's that?\n-That's the Zodiac at the lake.

285
00:23:49,276 --> 00:23:53,269
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the story with the kid? He seems a little touched or medicated or....

286
00:23:53,447 --> 00:23:55,711
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Graysmith? He's a fucking Boy Scout.\n-Yeah.

287
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:58,545
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink, he doesn't curse.

288
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:01,552
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And he's back.\n-"Man is the most dangerous animal."

289
00:24:01,722 --> 00:24:04,987
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew that I heard that from somewhere. The Most Dangerous Game.

290
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,855
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a movie about a count who hunts people for sport.

291
00:24:08,028 --> 00:24:10,656
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People. The Most Dangerous Game.

292
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:14,524
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who's that? That's the...?\n-That's Count Zaroff.

293
00:24:14,702 --> 00:24:17,694
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Zaroff? With a Z?

294
00:24:19,406 --> 00:24:20,964
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That will be all for the news.

295
00:24:21,142 --> 00:24:23,633
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got curfews tonight for the following counties:

296
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:26,507
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Napa, Solano, Contra Costa, Alameda, Marin, and San Mateo...

297
00:24:26,814 --> 00:24:27,906


298
00:24:28,082 --> 00:24:29,879
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so please, everyone, stay safe.

299
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:33,577
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}vic in San Francisco, you're on the line. You're not scared of the Zodiac?

300
00:24:33,754 --> 00:24:36,416
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heck, no, he's only shooting those farm kids.

301
00:24:36,624 --> 00:24:39,115
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What scares me is those hippies out in the Haight...

302
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:41,284
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...with their free love and weird clothes.

303
00:24:41,462 --> 00:24:43,362
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Taxi.\n-We've got Alfred from vacaville.

304
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:47,399
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I think that was really offensive. It's not just farm kids.

305
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:49,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are nice clean-cut people.

306
00:24:49,336 --> 00:24:51,896
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, nobody's downplaying the loss of human life here.

307
00:24:52,072 --> 00:24:53,972
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that last guy was.

308
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:57,008
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have good solid communities out here in the North Bay...

309
00:24:57,178 --> 00:25:00,739
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...unlike in the city where you have Satanists running around.

310
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:03,941
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you bring up a good question. Is the Zodiac a Satanist?

311
00:25:04,118 --> 00:25:06,086
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amber from Oakland, what do you think?

312
00:25:06,253 --> 00:25:09,984
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, but I thought that code they printed didn't look very Christian.

313
00:25:10,157 --> 00:25:12,182
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think a bigger problem is the papers...

314
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,089
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...shouldn't have printed anything Zodiac has been doing.

315
00:25:15,262 --> 00:25:18,254
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That they're printing all that stuff to sell more newspapers.

316
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:22,333
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, the Zodiac did demand they print his letters or he'd kill more people.

00:25:22,503 --> 00:25:25,563
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he would have done it anyway, whether they printed it or not.

318
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:29,072
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An interesting point. So, what do you think he'll do next?

319
00:25:49,797 --> 00:25:53,028
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-San Francisco Police Department.\n-There's a fight in a cab!

320
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is your location?

321

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}3398 Washington, at the corner of Cherry.

322
00:25:57,771 --> 00:25:59,762
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One's drunk and we think he's robbing him.

323
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,398
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Is the crime still in progress?\n-Yes, please hurry.

325
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:30,636
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nuts!

326
00:26:33,274 --> 00:26:35,265
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoever this is, you owe me a new lamp.

327
00:26:35,442 --> 00:26:38,002
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cabby's been shot three blocks from the Presidio.

328
00:26:38,178 --> 00:26:41,113
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It wasn't me. I been with my bride all night, she can vouch.

329
00:26:41,282 --> 00:26:43,341
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go put on the Folgers.

00:26:43,517 --> 00:26:44,916
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll pick me up?

331
00:26:45,085 --> 00:26:47,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me just describe the lamp you're gonna buy me.

332
00:26:55,629 --> 00:26:58,723
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I just got to sleep.\n-Suspect's Negro, male adult.

333
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:01,333
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walt's on scene, locked the cab, secured the crowd.

334
00:27:01,502 --> 00:27:04,198
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dead asleep. I lost feeling in my arm and everything.

335
00:27:04,371 --> 00:27:05,963
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crackers?

336
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ever try Japanese food?

337
00:27:11,478 --> 00:27:14,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What do you mean, like teriyaki?\n-No, like the urchin.

338
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:16,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Raw fish?\n-I'm eating here, Bill.

339
00:27:18,152 --> 00:27:21,053
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I always wanted to try it.\n-So why don't you?

340
00:27:21,221 --> 00:27:22,745
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Haven't got around to it.

341
00:27:38,872 --> 00:27:41,864
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Evening, gents. What a lovely night for a botched robbery.

342
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:44,533
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, third this week. Must be end-of-summer rush.

343
00:27:44,712 --> 00:27:47,875
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got foot patrols going through the park, the dogs are on the way.

344
00:27:48,048 --> 00:27:52,144
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The victim's name is Paul Stine. Dousette pronounced him at 10:10.

345
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,312
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Suspect fired one shot to the head. Driver's wallet and car keys are missing.

346
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,481
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How'd you know his name?\n-Leroy there...

347
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:00,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...came down from Yellow Cab to lD him.

348
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:04,495
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neighborhood's pretty high-end for this, so I already set up transpo for the cab.

349
00:28:04,665 --> 00:28:06,189
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Coroner's here.\n-Any witnesses?

350
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:09,359
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kids who called it in saw the suspect from that window.

351
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,335
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-They hear a shot?\n-No.

352
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:14,338
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They saw him in the front seat, thought he was a drunk.

353
00:28:14,508 --> 00:28:17,341
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oldest kid ran to get a better look from the dining room...

354
00:28:17,511 --> 00:28:21,709
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...described him as a white male, glasses, crew cut, stocky, and wearing a dark jacket.

355
00:28:21,882 --> 00:28:25,648
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I thought someone said he was black.\n-The description went out to radio cars.

356
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:28,515
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We already corrected it.\n-Oh, well, that's good.

357
00:28:28,689 --> 00:28:31,123
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You guys need anything else?\n-No. Get out of here.

358
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:33,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks. Happy birthday.

359
00:28:33,193 --> 00:28:35,184
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, it's your birthday?

360
00:28:35,362 --> 00:28:37,023
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yep.\n-That's great. Happy birthday.

361
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:41,031
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Thanks. Body or scene?\n-It's your birthday, I'll take the body.

362
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:45,297
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave, he wiped the cab down pretty good. We got some blood over here.

363
00:28:45,472 --> 00:28:47,804
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Prints?\n-Could be. We'll dust it at the Hall.

364
00:28:47,975 --> 00:28:50,637
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The odd thing is, we also got gloves.

365
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:53,905
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Suspect's?\n-There's blood on them.

366
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:57,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Pete? You through over there, can I get in there?

367
00:28:57,484 --> 00:28:58,473
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm all set.

368
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,352
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who rolled him?\n-Stewarts.

369
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:11,693
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a single 9 mm casing.

370
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:17,298
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, Luger.

371
00:29:17,471 --> 00:29:19,598
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing from the crowd.

372
00:29:19,773 --> 00:29:22,173
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm your shooter, Negro male adult...

373
00:29:22,342 --> 00:29:25,209
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...who also happens to be a stocky, crew-cut Caucasian.

374
00:29:25,446 --> 00:29:27,846
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I flag a cab. I give him this address.

375
00:29:28,048 --> 00:29:30,949
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did I give him this address? Who's got the fare book?

376
00:29:31,118 --> 00:29:32,346
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right here.

377
00:29:34,922 --> 00:29:38,824
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Washington and Maple. That's one block east.

378
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:02,348
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lighting's the same over here, so maybe I see someone walking their dog.

379
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:06,612
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't want any witnesses, so you tell him to go down a block. Pulls over.

380
00:30:06,787 --> 00:30:08,778
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wait for him to park because I'm smart.

381
00:30:08,956 --> 00:30:11,447
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want him hitting the accelerator when I shoot.

382
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He stops, puts it in park:

383
00:30:13,994 --> 00:30:16,326
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I shoot him on the right side, he slumps right?

384
00:30:16,497 --> 00:30:19,057
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you've got your hand on his collar when you shoot.

385
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:21,929
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I just dumped a quart of blood in the front seat.

386
00:30:22,102 --> 00:30:25,003
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-So why do you get in the front seat?\n-For the money.

387
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:28,164
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you could just reach over the seat, pull out his wallet.

388
00:30:28,342 --> 00:30:30,833
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have to go anywhere near the blood.

389
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:32,842
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So why'd he get in the front seat?

390
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:35,081
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm an idiot.\n-But you're not.

391
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:37,012
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You waited for him to put it in park.

392
00:30:37,184 --> 00:30:39,448
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Right. Thank you.\n-Yeah, sure.

393
00:30:41,121 --> 00:30:43,248
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-May I see that?\n-Yeah.

394
00:30:43,423 --> 00:30:46,551
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am an idiot. I just killed a man for $8.25.

395
00:30:46,727 --> 00:30:51,096
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's his third fare of the night. Does anyone have any Animal Crackers?

396
00:30:51,665 --> 00:30:53,997
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Animal Crackers?\n-They're in the car.

397
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:56,101
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm saving those for later.

398
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,931
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine.

399
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:05,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Are you a reporter?\n-No, I'm Inspector Dave Toschi, S.F.P.D.

400
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:09,377
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, I was wondering if I'd be able to talk to your children one at a time...

401
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-...and preferably alone?\n-They just saw a man murdered.

402
00:31:12,886 --> 00:31:14,285
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand.

403
00:31:14,454 --> 00:31:17,355
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It looked like they were drunk.\n-Yeah, and he had a rag.

404
00:31:17,524 --> 00:31:19,822
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He came around the car. He was wiping stuff.

405
00:31:19,993 --> 00:31:21,824
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you get a chance to see his face?

406
00:31:21,995 --> 00:31:25,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did. Well, sort of.

407
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:28,765
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you remember what he looked like?

408
00:31:30,337 --> 00:31:31,702
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Normal.

409
00:31:31,872 --> 00:31:33,931
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah.\n-Normal?

410
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:41,577


411
00:31:41,748 --> 00:31:43,340


412
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,921


413
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:00,261
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"This is the Zodiac speaking. I am the murderer of the taxi driver...

414
00:32:00,434 --> 00:32:03,835
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...over by Washington Street and Maple Street last night.

415
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:06,837
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To prove this, here is a bloodstained piece of his shirt.

00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:11,603
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am the same man who did in the people in the North Bay Area.

417
00:32:11,778 --> 00:32:16,147
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The police could've caught me last night if they had searched the park properly...

418
00:32:16,316 --> 00:32:19,251
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...instead of holding road races with their 'motorsickles."'

419
00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:20,852
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Gentlemen.\n-Dave.

420
00:32:21,021 --> 00:32:23,319
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paul, where's the shirt?

421
00:32:24,424 --> 00:32:25,982
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right there, boss.

422
00:32:27,194 --> 00:32:30,789
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Your rag the kids talked about.\n-So he got in the seat to tear off a piece.

423
00:32:30,964 --> 00:32:33,262
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Is this on the record?\n-Well, what do you think?

424
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:35,594
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He confirms the Vallejo and Napa killings.

425
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:38,329
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Gets worse.\n-Robert, do you have a deadline?

426
00:32:39,606 --> 00:32:41,198
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does he mean, "it gets worse"?

427
00:32:41,575 --> 00:32:42,906
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Read the last part.

428
00:32:43,076 --> 00:32:45,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"School children make nice targets.

429
00:32:45,512 --> 00:32:47,639
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I shall wipe out a bus some morning.

430
00:32:47,814 --> 00:32:49,304
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just shoot out the front tire...

431
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:52,111
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out."

432
00:32:52,285 --> 00:32:54,446
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's got buses, Department of Transportation?

433
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:56,486
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-School board.\n-All right.

434
00:32:56,657 --> 00:32:58,989
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna need elimination prints from your staff.

435
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,753
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is anyone here that didn't touch this letter?

436
00:33:06,032 --> 00:33:08,262
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Going back to my desk. I can get the phones if you want.

437
00:33:08,468 --> 00:33:10,231
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need matches on blood and fabric.

438
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:13,202
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll call and get the letters up to Sherwood in Sacramento.

439
00:33:13,373 --> 00:33:16,604
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave, just one thing. Is it true they got a print off the cab?

440
00:33:16,777 --> 00:33:19,439
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we got a partial in blood.

441
00:33:19,946 --> 00:33:22,506
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-But that is not for publication.\n-No, hey, come on.

442
00:33:23,316 --> 00:33:25,443
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, it's me.

443
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:27,484
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did he say they got a print?

444
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:30,188
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Partial.

445
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,421
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He wears his gun like Bullitt.\n-No, McQueen got that from Toschi.

446
00:33:37,597 --> 00:33:41,055
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He think Zodiac's gonna send another code? I think Zodiac's gonna send...

447
00:33:41,234 --> 00:33:44,203
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus Harold Christ on rubber crutches. What are you doing?

448
00:33:44,371 --> 00:33:47,534
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're doing that thing we discussed. The thing that I don't like.

449
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:49,198
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Starts with an L.\n-Oh, looming.

450
00:33:49,376 --> 00:33:50,365
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

451
00:33:50,544 --> 00:33:52,307
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In cooperation with S.F.P.D...

452
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:56,074
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...we will run the Zodiac letter without including the threat on children.

453
00:33:56,249 --> 00:33:58,183
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't wanna start a city-wide panic...

454
00:33:58,351 --> 00:34:01,377
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so I'm asking all of you to please keep this confidential.

455
00:34:01,555 --> 00:34:05,616
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just go about your daily business. Thank you.

456
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:24,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Packed you your carrots and your celery and peanut butter, okay?

457
00:34:24,177 --> 00:34:27,374
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Dad, you don't have to wait with me.\n-I know.

458
00:34:28,381 --> 00:34:30,281
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Shirley.

459
00:34:34,554 --> 00:34:38,718
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? You know what? I'm gonna drive him today, okay?

460
00:34:38,892 --> 00:34:40,257
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

461
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:47,522


462
00:34:57,978 --> 00:34:59,275
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?

463
00:34:59,613 --> 00:35:02,741
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Similarities in the lowercase R's.

464
00:35:11,525 --> 00:35:13,789
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And that?\n-It is you waiting in the hall...

465
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,861
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...if you speak again. I have to concentrate.

466
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:20,557
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sorry.\n-"Sorry" counts as speaking.

467
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:33,741
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are similarities in the lowercase R's.

468
00:35:38,251 --> 00:35:40,242
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to release the bus threat.

469
00:35:40,854 --> 00:35:43,846
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It'll screw us.\n-We're already screwed.

470
00:35:44,024 --> 00:35:46,117
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We just went from "Routine Cabby Shooting"...

471
00:35:46,293 --> 00:35:48,158
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to "Mass Murderer Targets Kids."

472
00:35:56,269 --> 00:35:59,067
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Zodiac Killer has come to San Francisco.

473
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:02,231
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Confirmation tonight from the San Francisco Police Department...

474
00:36:02,409 --> 00:36:04,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that in his latest taunting letter...

475
00:36:04,578 --> 00:36:07,638
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...which takes credit for the murder of cabdriver Paul Stine...

476
00:36:07,814 --> 00:36:11,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the Zodiac has threatened to, quote, "Wipe out a school bus...

477
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:14,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out."

478
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:20,749
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you think you might know who the Zodiac is...

479
00:36:20,927 --> 00:36:25,057
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you can call the San Francisco Police Department's newest tip line.

480
00:36:29,035 --> 00:36:32,232


481
00:36:33,273 --> 00:36:36,709


482
00:36:41,815 --> 00:36:43,442
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need policemen out there.

483
00:36:48,255 --> 00:36:51,088
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Press conference is at 4. We gotta give them something.

484
00:36:51,258 --> 00:36:54,557
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're coordinating with the school board, and we expect a break soon.

485
00:36:54,728 --> 00:36:56,923
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What do we really got?\n-We're swamped.

486
00:36:57,097 --> 00:36:59,895
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When they can't get the tip line, they call the switchboard.

487
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:03,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You got any hard suspects?\n-About 90 an hour. I'm up to around 500.

488
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Can't you narrow it down?\n-I would love to, if I could get out...

489
00:37:07,307 --> 00:37:08,604
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Homicide, please hold.

490
00:37:08,775 --> 00:37:12,734
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, hold, please. We're gonna need to tell them we got the entire force on this.

491
00:37:12,913 --> 00:37:16,781
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How many men can you give me?\n-You and Bill, and Monday's a school day.

492
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,577
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. I have three daughters.

493
00:37:18,752 --> 00:37:21,983
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah, I know. Where's Armstrong?\n-He's on the phone with Vallejo.

494
00:37:22,155 --> 00:37:23,918
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're playing catch-up, Jack.

495
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,581
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to set up a meeting with your Michael Mageau.

496
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,022
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't. He skipped town.

497
00:37:28,194 --> 00:37:31,186
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only guy who's seen Zodiac without a mask is missing?

498
00:37:31,364 --> 00:37:34,299
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When he was in the hospital we could show him lineups all day.

499
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:36,628
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Soon as he got out, he split.\n-Really? Why?

500
00:37:36,803 --> 00:37:39,135
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think he wanted anything to do with this.

501
00:37:39,306 --> 00:37:41,399
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you send us everything that you have?

502
00:37:41,574 --> 00:37:44,338
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, the road goes both ways.

503
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:47,036
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, we need that print you lifted from the cab...

504
00:37:47,213 --> 00:37:49,545
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and we should have been in on the handwriting.

505
00:37:49,716 --> 00:37:51,775
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I apologize. Things have been moving fast.

506
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:54,546
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who should I talk to in Napa so we can coordinate?

507
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:55,983
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Talk to Ken Narlow.

508
00:37:56,156 --> 00:37:58,147
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should have been in on the handwriting.

509
00:37:58,325 --> 00:38:00,793
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I apologize. Things have been moving fast.

510
00:38:00,961 --> 00:38:03,156
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We're gonna need your photos.\n-Can't help you.

511
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,491
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna get into a jurisdictional thing...

512
00:38:05,665 --> 00:38:07,895
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. We didn't have a crime scene.

513
00:38:08,068 --> 00:38:11,435
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The ranger literally swept everything into a picnic blanket.

514
00:38:11,604 --> 00:38:14,266
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-All we have are the Wing Walker prints.\n-The what?

515
00:38:14,441 --> 00:38:18,707
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boot prints to and from the crime scene made by Size 10-and-a-half Wing Walkers.

516
00:38:18,878 --> 00:38:21,574
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Military-style boots sold only at military PXs.

517
00:38:21,748 --> 00:38:23,807
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Designed to walk on the wings of planes.

518
00:38:23,984 --> 00:38:26,452
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you can't buy at a PX without a military ID...

519
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:28,644
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so our suspect could be military.

520
00:38:28,822 --> 00:38:31,154
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Did you guys narrow your list off of this?\n-Yeah.

521
00:38:31,324 --> 00:38:32,848
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Did vallejo?\n-I don't know.

522
00:38:33,026 --> 00:38:34,891
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't work in Vallejo. I work here.

523
00:38:35,061 --> 00:38:38,895
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'll need photos of those boot prints.\n-Sure, if you send me the handwriting.

524
00:38:39,065 --> 00:38:40,726
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought Questioned Documents did.

525
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,697
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nope. Vallejo's got them, not us.

526
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:46,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll have Questioned Documents... Forget it. I'll telefax it to you.

527
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:48,066
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't have telefax yet.

528
00:38:48,241 --> 00:38:50,675
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Okay, I'll put it in the mail.\n-We'll mail ours too.

529
00:38:50,844 --> 00:38:53,938
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And call Mulanax in Vallejo. Maybe he can get you a mimeo.

530
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:56,947
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Right.\n-Why don't you get a photo off the cast?

531
00:38:57,117 --> 00:38:59,483
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'd have to wait because they don't have a fax.

532
00:38:59,652 --> 00:39:01,176
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't have a fax, either.

533
00:39:01,354 --> 00:39:04,448
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm just trying to get us coordinated.\n-Have you called Solano?

534
00:39:04,624 --> 00:39:06,319
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would I call Solano?

535
00:39:06,493 --> 00:39:09,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because the two kids that got killed last Christmas were Solano's.

536
00:39:09,863 --> 00:39:12,855
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I thought they were Vallejo.\n-They were over the county line.

537
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:16,332
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You'll need to coordinate them too.\n-Okay.

538
00:39:16,503 --> 00:39:19,131
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bill? Can I have a word with you?

539
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:25,234
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you see this guy?

540
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,479
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got the call to look for a Negro male adult...

541
00:39:28,648 --> 00:39:29,945
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where was he?

542
00:39:30,116 --> 00:39:33,051
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On Jackson. Heading east. About the middle of the block.

543
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:35,949
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-This is three minutes after the shooting?\n-Give or take.

544
00:39:36,122 --> 00:39:38,784
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And you were heading east or west?\n-We were going west.

545
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:40,619
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you're on Jackson going west.

546
00:39:40,794 --> 00:39:43,558
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So the cab was one block catty-corner southwest?

547
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:44,719
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Correct.

548
00:39:44,898 --> 00:39:47,526
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Did you slow down?\n-Of course we slowed down.

549
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,827
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, Dispatch said it was a Negro male.

550
00:39:50,003 --> 00:39:51,197
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was corrected.

551
00:39:51,371 --> 00:39:53,896
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, but at the time they hadn't changed it.

552
00:39:54,074 --> 00:39:57,874
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This guy was white. Right, not in a hurry. Kind of lumbering along like...

553
00:39:58,044 --> 00:40:00,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lumbering? What do you mean, "lumbering"?

554
00:40:01,981 --> 00:40:04,609
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Shuffling.\n-Stocky? Had a crew cut?

555
00:40:05,718 --> 00:40:07,151
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's all correct.

556
00:40:08,455 --> 00:40:11,856
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, it was dark. The guy was wearing a dark jacket.

557
00:40:12,025 --> 00:40:15,256
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-There's no way...\n-He would have been covered in blood.

558
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,523
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you stop him?

559
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,392
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you talk to him?

560
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:24,937
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yes? No?\n-No.

561
00:40:25,705 --> 00:40:27,536
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to get with a sketch artist.

562
00:40:27,707 --> 00:40:30,198
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to put out a new composite right away.

563
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,812
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Five persons have been murdered in the area and...

564
00:40:35,982 --> 00:40:36,971


565
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,139
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...in each case, the killer...

566
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:40,548
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I shall wipe out a school bus some morning..."

567
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,813
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}San Francisco police...

568
00:40:44,124 --> 00:40:46,752
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To see the Stones in concert this Sunday....

569
00:40:46,926 --> 00:40:48,917
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The new letters from the Zodiac Killer...

570
00:40:49,095 --> 00:40:52,155
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...were sent to the City room of the San Francisco Chronicle.

571
00:40:52,632 --> 00:40:55,192
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looming. No looming.

572
00:40:55,368 --> 00:40:58,201
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Have you considered the water theory?\n-What?

573
00:40:58,371 --> 00:41:01,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every attack takes place near a body of water or a water-based name.

574
00:41:01,841 --> 00:41:04,833
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-This is your water theory?\n-Lake Berryessa. Blue Rock Springs.

575
00:41:05,011 --> 00:41:07,241
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Lake Herman.\n-Washington and Cherry?

576
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:11,977
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You think?\n-No.

577
00:41:12,152 --> 00:41:14,484
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm reading this book, Homicide Investigation...

578
00:41:14,654 --> 00:41:16,246
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-...by LeMoyne Snyder...\n-"LeMoyne."

579
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:17,821
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He says you look for patterns.

580
00:41:17,991 --> 00:41:21,154
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. You can't think of this case in normal police terms.

581
00:41:21,327 --> 00:41:23,591
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why not?\n-You got four crime scenes:

582
00:41:23,763 --> 00:41:26,596
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Solano, Vallejo, Berryessa and here.

583
00:41:26,766 --> 00:41:30,532
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not a single usable print at the first three or in any of the letters?

584
00:41:30,703 --> 00:41:34,104
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How does that master criminal come to the city and leave a bloody latent?

585
00:41:34,274 --> 00:41:36,435
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, assuming the gloves are his...

586
00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:38,941
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...he shoots the cabby and then takes them off?

587
00:41:39,112 --> 00:41:40,101
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So it's not his print?

588
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe. You're missing the point. The point is the first attack...

589
00:41:43,516 --> 00:41:46,076
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-David Faraday and Betty Jensen.\n-They both die.

590
00:41:46,252 --> 00:41:48,584
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From there out, he only manages to kill the girls.

591
00:41:48,755 --> 00:41:51,019
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Not for lack of trying.\n-Not for lack of trying.

592
00:41:51,191 --> 00:41:54,752
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mageau lives, Ferrin dies. Hartnell lives, Shepard dies.

593
00:41:54,928 --> 00:41:58,056
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He gets so caught up with the women, he forgets to finish the men.

594
00:41:58,231 --> 00:42:00,563
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Plus they're all couples and all on lovers' lanes.

595
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:02,428
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Paul Stine is not.\n-Exactly.

596
00:42:02,602 --> 00:42:04,763
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Single male cab driver on Cherry doesn't fit.

597
00:42:04,938 --> 00:42:06,667
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't fit.

598
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,768
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So why does Zodiac kill him?

599
00:42:12,278 --> 00:42:14,405
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's breaking the pattern.

600
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,117
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah?\n-Someone claiming to be Zodiac...

601
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:28,021
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...called Oakland P.D. a half-hour ago.

602
00:42:28,294 --> 00:42:29,352


603
00:42:29,529 --> 00:42:31,554
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Says he's gonna call in on Jim Dunbar's morning show in three hours.

604
00:42:31,731 --> 00:42:34,632
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-On television?\n-He wants Melvin Belli on to counsel him.

605
00:42:34,801 --> 00:42:37,269
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. All right. Let's go wake up Melvin.

606
00:42:39,806 --> 00:42:41,205
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Animal Crackers?

607
00:42:41,374 --> 00:42:42,966
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Glove box.

608
00:42:43,142 --> 00:42:44,769
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are these windows bulletproof?

609
00:42:44,944 --> 00:42:47,378
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, Melvin. You don't have to lie down back there.

610
00:42:47,547 --> 00:42:51,506
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This man is a marksman. Could snuff me out at a moment's notice.

611
00:42:51,684 --> 00:42:55,017
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Are you sure you're up for this?\n-Don't you worry about me, inspector.

612
00:42:55,188 --> 00:42:57,383
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be fine when the lights are on.

613
00:42:57,557 --> 00:42:59,457
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This man has asked for my help.

614
00:42:59,626 --> 00:43:01,787
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The man you're worrying about snuffing you out?

615
00:43:01,961 --> 00:43:05,226
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are these, cookies?

616
00:43:05,398 --> 00:43:07,457
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dear Lord, do you ever clean this car?

617
00:43:07,634 --> 00:43:11,968
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit. KGO must have tipped other stations.

618
00:43:20,947 --> 00:43:23,677
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him talking. Convince him to meet you somewhere.

619
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:27,786
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you see an opportunity, we want you to suggest Old Saint Mary's Church.

620
00:43:27,954 --> 00:43:29,353
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be tracing the call?

621
00:43:29,522 --> 00:43:32,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to keep him on the line for 15 minutes.

622
00:43:32,492 --> 00:43:35,359
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can do that, can't we, Jim?

623
00:43:37,363 --> 00:43:41,026
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Fifteen seconds. Clear the set.\n-Clear the set.

624
00:43:45,905 --> 00:43:48,999
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you go, you drunken reprobate.

625
00:43:49,175 --> 00:43:51,666
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We interrupt our program to bring you this bulletin.

626
00:43:51,844 --> 00:43:56,076
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This special edition of our show, we are joined by attorney Melvin Belli...

627
00:43:56,249 --> 00:43:59,309
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...who the Zodiac Killer personally requested to appear.

628
00:43:59,485 --> 00:44:01,476
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finish up, buddy, and put it in the sink.

629
00:44:01,654 --> 00:44:04,452
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Good morning, Melvin.\n-Good morning, Jim.

630
00:44:04,624 --> 00:44:07,821
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So the phone lines are open. Mr. Belli is here.

631
00:44:07,994 --> 00:44:10,929
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Here to help, Jim.\n-Yes. Here to help.

632
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:16,591
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we ask the public not to call in so that the Zodiac himself can reach us.

633
00:44:24,777 --> 00:44:27,337
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw your Star Trek, by the way. It was excellent.

634
00:44:27,513 --> 00:44:31,813
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A shame about the show. Good people.

635
00:44:31,984 --> 00:44:35,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I've often thought of becoming an actor full-time.

636
00:44:35,621 --> 00:44:37,612
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What was your character's name?\n-Gorgan.

637
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:39,917
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gorgan. That's right.

638
00:44:40,927 --> 00:44:45,227
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Roll the tape. Get the tape.\n-Jim, we have a call. We're going live.

639
00:44:46,766 --> 00:44:48,529
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

640
00:44:51,504 --> 00:44:54,302
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? This is Melvin Belli.

641
00:44:54,907 --> 00:44:56,841
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who am I speaking with?

642
00:44:57,009 --> 00:45:00,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the Zodiac speaking.

643
00:45:02,548 --> 00:45:06,609
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there something I can call you that's a little less ominous?

644
00:45:08,388 --> 00:45:09,719
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam.

645
00:45:12,294 --> 00:45:15,966
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there somewhere we can meet, Sam, and talk about this?

646
00:45:16,378 --> 00:45:19,714
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meet me on top of the Fairmont Hotel.

647
00:45:19,756 --> 00:45:21,588
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Without anyone else or I'll jump...

648
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:23,504
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have a unit go to the Fairmont Hotel.

649
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:25,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sam.\n-Yes.

650
00:45:26,425 --> 00:45:29,826
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam, do you think you need medical care?

651
00:45:29,995 --> 00:45:31,826
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Medical, not mental.

652
00:45:31,997 --> 00:45:34,192
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have health problems?

653
00:45:34,366 --> 00:45:36,061
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sick. I have headaches.

654
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,861
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Headaches?

655
00:45:38,036 --> 00:45:41,665
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have headaches, too, but a chiropractor stopped them a week ago.

656
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,538
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I can help you, Sam.

657
00:45:46,445 --> 00:45:47,776
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam?

658
00:45:49,815 --> 00:45:51,544
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He knows they're tracing his calls.

659
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:59,279
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam, we'd like you to know that we are not tracing these calls.

660
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:04,418
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a long, difficult process and ineffective with these short calls.

661
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:11,225
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam?

662
00:46:13,071 --> 00:46:16,563
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not tracing these calls. You have my word.

663
00:46:17,075 --> 00:46:18,337
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

664
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:22,037
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam, you need to tell me what your problem is.

665
00:46:22,214 --> 00:46:26,514
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to go to the gas chamber. I have headaches. I kill, I don't get them.

666
00:46:26,685 --> 00:46:28,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is fucked up.

667
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,121
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to live, don't you? Well, this is your passport.

668
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,154
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long have you been having headaches?

669
00:46:33,325 --> 00:46:35,816
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Since I killed a kid.

670
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,462
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Do you have blackouts?\n-Yes.

671
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,294
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Do you have fits?\n-No. I just have headaches.

672
00:46:42,294 --> 00:46:44,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you attempt to call one other time

673
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,672
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when F. Lee Bailey was with us two or three weeks ago?

674
00:46:46,672 --> 00:46:47,798
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

675
00:46:47,798 --> 00:46:49,714
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And why did you want to talk to Mr. Bailey?

676
00:46:49,714 --> 00:46:52,756
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you wanna tal k to me, Sam?

677
00:46:52,758 --> 00:46:54,787
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I don't want to be hurt.\n-Why is he calling?

678
00:46:54,964 --> 00:46:56,329
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, just a second, buddy.

679
00:46:56,499 --> 00:46:58,524
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You won't get hurt if you talk to me.

680
00:46:58,701 --> 00:47:00,965
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're not going to the gas chamber.

681
00:47:01,137 --> 00:47:03,799
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't think they would ask for capital punishment.

682
00:47:03,973 --> 00:47:07,932
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should ask the district attorney. Do you want me to do that, Sam?

683
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:11,341
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want me to talk to the district attorney?

684
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that, Sam?

685
00:47:17,687 --> 00:47:19,279
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did not say anything.

686
00:47:19,455 --> 00:47:22,049
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We heard a scream.

687
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:25,253
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was my headache.

688
00:47:25,428 --> 00:47:29,159
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sound like you're in a great deal of pain.

689
00:47:29,331 --> 00:47:33,199
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My head aches. I'm so sick.

690
00:47:34,036 --> 00:47:35,196
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna kill them.

691
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:38,467
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Okay.\n-I'm gonna kill those kids!

692
00:47:38,641 --> 00:47:40,768
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fantastic.

693
00:47:42,912 --> 00:47:44,311
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam?

694
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:48,372
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's meet and talk. Just us.

695
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:50,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

696
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,787
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about Old Saint Mary's Church in Chinatown?

697
00:47:52,955 --> 00:47:58,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. In front of the Daly City St. vincent De Paul at 10:30.

698
00:47:58,294 --> 00:48:00,421
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see you there.

699
00:48:01,797 --> 00:48:03,788
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take care of yourself, Sam.

700
00:48:12,108 --> 00:48:13,097


701
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:33,084
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My, my, my. You fellows certainly know how to put on a secret meeting.

702
00:48:33,429 --> 00:48:34,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Belli, over here.

703
00:48:37,066 --> 00:48:42,333
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to go to the gas chamber. I have headaches. I kill, I don't get them.

704
00:48:42,505 --> 00:48:44,837
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's not him.

705
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:47,942
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the voice. The voice is too high. It's too young.

706
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,578
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Thanks for coming down, Bryan.

707
00:48:51,747 --> 00:48:53,908
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's okay. I got it.

708
00:48:59,822 --> 00:49:04,054
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They pulled off the trace. Our Daly City no-show called from a mental institution.

709
00:49:04,226 --> 00:49:08,629
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oakland P.D.'s operator is sure the man she talked to had a deeper voice.

710
00:49:08,798 --> 00:49:13,064
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calmer. Might have actually been him.

711
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:20,903
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"So I shall change my way of collecting slaves.

712
00:49:21,811 --> 00:49:22,800


713
00:49:22,978 --> 00:49:26,106
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I shall no longer announce to anyone when I commit my murders.

714
00:49:26,282 --> 00:49:29,342
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They shall look like routine robberies, killings of anger...

715
00:49:29,518 --> 00:49:32,248

716
00:49:32,421 --> 00:49:35,857
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The police shall never catch me, because I have been too clever for them.

717
00:49:36,025 --> 00:49:39,722
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I look like the description passed out only when I do my thing.

718
00:49:39,895 --> 00:49:42,693
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The rest of the time I look entirely different.

719
00:49:42,865 --> 00:49:47,734
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I shall not tell you what my disguise consists of when I kill.

720
00:49:47,903 --> 00:49:50,633
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As of yet I have left no fingerprints behind me...

721
00:49:50,806 --> 00:49:53,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...contrary to what the police say.

722
00:49:53,409 --> 00:49:56,572
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wear transparent fingertips.

723
00:49:56,745 --> 00:50:01,341
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All it is is two coats of airplane cement coated on my fingertips.

724
00:50:01,517 --> 00:50:05,613
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I enjoy needling the blue pigs. Hey, blue pig, I was in the park.

725
00:50:05,788 --> 00:50:11,317
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were using firetrucks to mask the sound of your cruising prowl cars.

726
00:50:11,493 --> 00:50:15,156
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, pig, doesn't it rile you up to have your nose rubbed in your boo-boos?

727
00:50:15,965 --> 00:50:19,332
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you cops think I am going to take on a bus the way I stated I was...

728
00:50:19,501 --> 00:50:23,267
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you deserve to have holes in your heads."

729
00:50:24,807 --> 00:50:27,002
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you need to look at this.

730
00:50:29,678 --> 00:50:31,873
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Take one bag of ammonium-nitrate fertilizer...

731
00:50:32,047 --> 00:50:36,177
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...one gallon of stove oil and dump a few bags of gravel on top...."

732
00:50:36,352 --> 00:50:37,819
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Okay.\n-It's a bomb.

733
00:50:37,987 --> 00:50:39,249
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta call the Army...

734
00:50:39,421 --> 00:50:42,254
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and see if this science experiment could actually work.

735
00:50:42,892 --> 00:50:44,553
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Another cipher.

736
00:50:46,528 --> 00:50:49,258
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-When did these arrive?\n-They arrived this morning.

737
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:51,524
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Are you planning to publish?\n-Robert.

738
00:50:53,402 --> 00:50:55,267
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should have a drink.

739
00:50:59,475 --> 00:51:01,067
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

740
00:51:02,711 --> 00:51:06,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So tell me about yourself. You married?

741
00:51:06,181 --> 00:51:09,344
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Divorced. I have two kids.

742
00:51:09,718 --> 00:51:11,549
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you do for fun?

743
00:51:12,955 --> 00:51:14,946
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love to read.

744
00:51:15,457 --> 00:51:17,516
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I enjoy books.\n-Those are the same things.

745
00:51:17,693 --> 00:51:20,287
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why you been going through my trash?

746
00:51:23,399 --> 00:51:25,264
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll come back to that.

747
00:51:26,035 --> 00:51:28,697
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How'd you know he'd send another code?\n-I just guessed.

748
00:51:29,338 --> 00:51:31,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You just guessed.\n-The first one seemed too easy.

749
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,001
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, this can no longer be ignored.

750
00:51:34,176 --> 00:51:35,803
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is that you're drinking?

751
00:51:35,978 --> 00:51:37,843
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's an Aqua Velva.

752
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:40,072
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wouldn't make fun of it if you tried it.

753
00:51:50,426 --> 00:51:52,621
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But who actually cracked the code?

754
00:51:53,595 --> 00:51:57,622
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A married couple who liked puzzles. So, what's that tell us about the Zodiac?

755
00:51:58,233 --> 00:52:01,202
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He's no expert.\n-Right. It's a simple substitution code...

756
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...like the one that we used to do as Boy Scouts.

757
00:52:03,772 --> 00:52:07,367
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-A is one, B is two.\n-We weren't all Boy Scouts, Robert.

758
00:52:07,543 --> 00:52:10,444
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's not that hard. You just gotta know where to start.

759
00:52:10,612 --> 00:52:13,604
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-In the first cipher...\n-You actually carry that around with you?

760
00:52:13,782 --> 00:52:16,273
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why?\n-No reason.

761
00:52:16,485 --> 00:52:19,477
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the most common double consonant in the English language?

762
00:52:20,155 --> 00:52:21,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Consonant?\n-The double L.

763
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,521
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Double L.\n-And what's the one word...

764
00:52:23,692 --> 00:52:26,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that we know that he'll use in here, at least once?

765
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,655
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-"Kill."\n-Right, "kill."

766
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:31,391
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Hardens start look for double symbols, which they find here and here...

767
00:52:31,567 --> 00:52:33,694
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...each with the same symbols preceding them.

768
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:37,862
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've got a repeating four-letter word ending with two symbols that stand for L.

769
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,203
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Since they think the word is "kill"....\n-You got your K, your I...

770
00:52:41,377 --> 00:52:42,708
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and you're on your way.

771
00:52:42,878 --> 00:52:46,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But how do you go from A is one, B is two to figuring out this whole code?

772
00:52:46,548 --> 00:52:49,915
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, same way I did. You go to the library.

773
00:52:52,588 --> 00:52:54,579
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In this book...

774
00:52:54,757 --> 00:52:55,746


775
00:52:55,924 --> 00:52:58,688
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the author presents a very simple substitution code in the preface.

776
00:52:58,861 --> 00:53:01,762
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eight of the 26 symbols he suggests are found in this cipher.

777
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:04,763
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there are non-letter symbols. There's these medieval ones.

778
00:53:04,933 --> 00:53:07,094
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought they looked medieval too.

779
00:53:08,203 --> 00:53:11,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I found a code written in the Middle Ages. Guess what it's called.

780
00:53:12,074 --> 00:53:13,803
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The zodiac alphabet.

781
00:53:15,744 --> 00:53:17,439
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus.

782
00:53:18,313 --> 00:53:20,543
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What do you want out of this?\n-What?

783
00:53:20,716 --> 00:53:24,379
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your angle? This is good business for everyone but you.

784
00:53:27,189 --> 00:53:29,157
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you mean "business"?

785
00:53:32,094 --> 00:53:34,392
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Come to bed.

786
00:53:34,563 --> 00:53:37,589
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be up in a minute. I need to make a phone call.

787
00:53:49,745 --> 00:53:51,872
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hello?\n-Bill?

788
00:53:52,047 --> 00:53:54,379
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's not many basements in California.

789
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,017
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Basement for future use."

790
00:53:56,452 --> 00:53:58,044
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right.

791
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:02,884
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll have vallejo and Napa check with their city planners. Get some sleep.

792
00:54:03,058 --> 00:54:04,821
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, sure.

793
00:54:13,802 --> 00:54:17,033


794
00:54:17,206 --> 00:54:19,606
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Dear Melvin, this is the Zodiac speaking.

795
00:54:20,175 --> 00:54:22,234
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish you a happy Christmas.

796
00:54:22,411 --> 00:54:25,903
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The one thing I ask of you is this: Please help me.

797
00:54:26,081 --> 00:54:29,642
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I cannot reach out for help, because this thing in me won't let me."

798
00:54:29,818 --> 00:54:30,807
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

799
00:54:30,986 --> 00:54:34,251
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I am finding it extremely difficult to hold it in check...

800
00:54:34,423 --> 00:54:37,984
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I am afraid I will lose control again and take my ninth...

801
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,821
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and possibly 10th victim."

802
00:54:39,995 --> 00:54:42,156
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Melvin, he's reaching out to you.

803
00:54:42,331 --> 00:54:47,064
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Absolutely. Inspectors, he sent this letter directly to my residence.

804
00:54:47,236 --> 00:54:50,205
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is a cry for help intended as a private communique.

805
00:54:50,372 --> 00:54:52,636
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which is why you contacted the Chronicle.

806
00:54:52,808 --> 00:54:55,709
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The people have a right to know. Toddy?

807
00:54:55,878 --> 00:54:58,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-When did the letter arrive?\n-In the middle of last week.

808
00:54:59,042 --> 00:55:01,546
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was away on safari.

809
00:55:01,546 --> 00:55:03,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you gentlemen do for Christmas?

810
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You're looking at it.\n-You must see Africa.

811
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:11,126
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cradle of civilization. Fascinating people. Beautiful. Savage.

812
00:55:11,126 --> 00:55:15,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Back to the killer who wrote to you.\n-Yes. Of course.

813
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,127
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is my belief that he penned this letter...

814
00:55:17,303 --> 00:55:19,965
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...because he couldn't get to me on the show or here.

816
00:55:22,741 --> 00:55:24,902
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was out, but he spoke with my housekeeper.

817
00:55:25,077 --> 00:55:27,238
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Didn't leave a number.\n-He's crafty like that.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the real story is the letter.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'll be back.\n-Yeah.

821
00:55:34,353 --> 00:55:37,151
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-She's right this way.\n-Inspector Toschi...

822
00:55:37,323 --> 00:55:40,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...it is my belief this is a window into this man's soul.

823
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,623
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Killing is his compulsion.

824
00:55:42,795 --> 00:55:46,492
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even though he tries to ignore it, it drives him. It's in his blood.

00:55:46,665 --> 00:55:49,498
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could be. Or maybe he just likes the attention.

00:56:41,053 --> 00:56:43,487
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I could tighten the lugs up for you.

00:58:29,628 --> 00:58:31,152
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?

836
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:35,129
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

00:58:36,168 --> 00:58:40,571
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Must have been worse than I thought. I can give you a lift to a service station.

00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:04,257
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know you had a baby.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, is that okay?

842
00:59:07,966 --> 00:59:10,025
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The more, the merrier.

00:59:19,578 --> 00:59:22,342
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You shouldn't smoke. It's a bad habit.

00:59:28,687 --> 00:59:31,155
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we just passed a filling station.

00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:43,961
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I'm done with them, they don't need much help.

00:59:47,172 --> 00:59:48,605
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay.

849
00:59:48,774 --> 00:59:50,969
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before I kill you...

850
00:59:51,143 --> 00:59:53,771
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I'm gonna throw your baby out the window.

01:00:21,106 --> 01:00:24,041
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said she jumped from a car. I found her like this.

01:04:24,716 --> 01:04:27,514
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we drove him underground.

929
01:04:27,719 --> 01:04:29,448
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe he's gone.

01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:13,677
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is Riverside?

01:08:16,481 --> 01:08:19,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think Paul knows that it's that far away.

01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,588
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sounds kind of dangerous.

997
01:08:24,856 --> 01:08:27,825
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. How do you mean?

998
01:08:27,993 --> 01:08:30,257
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you said it was an anonymous tip, right?

999
01:08:30,428 --> 01:08:31,759
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:35,764
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So it could be an ambush. I mean, it could be the Zodiac.

1001
01:08:37,035 --> 01:08:39,333
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you think it's kind of stupid?

1002
01:08:39,504 --> 01:08:42,234
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, yeah. Well, Paul has a gun.

1003
01:08:45,844 --> 01:08:49,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So do you know what's good here?

1007
01:09:01,526 --> 01:09:04,222
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll have the penne vodka, but do it in a cream sauce.

1008
01:09:04,396 --> 01:09:05,988
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course.

01:09:10,869 --> 01:09:12,598
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe give us another minute?

1010

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have any change?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, wait. No, wait, hold on.

1012
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:21,945
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Nope. That's a penny.\n-Do you have to make a phone call?

1013
01:09:22,113 --> 01:09:25,947
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you know, when you were saying that the Zodiac...?

1014
01:09:26,117 --> 01:09:29,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you said it was dangerous, I thought that it is dangerous, and...

1015
01:09:29,621 --> 01:09:30,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Stupid?\n-Stupid.

1016
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:35,886
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I just thought that I should call his wife and just see if she's heard from him.

1017
01:09:37,929 --> 01:09:39,453
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have some change.

1018
01:09:58,383 --> 01:10:01,648
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Well, she said she'd call when she heard from him.

1019
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:04,152
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Good.\n-Yeah.

1020
01:10:04,456 --> 01:10:08,916
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Melanie, I should really go home and wait for the call.

1021
01:10:11,463 --> 01:10:14,193
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this some sleazy plan to get me to go home with you?

1022
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,158
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No.

1023
01:10:19,404 --> 01:10:21,634
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll get the food to go.

1024
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:24,539
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello!

1025
01:10:40,358 --> 01:10:43,657
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi! I'm supposed to meet somebody here.

1026
01:11:01,479 --> 01:11:03,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything?

1027
01:11:06,251 --> 01:11:08,617
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You don't have to stay.\n-Are you kidding?

1028
01:11:09,554 --> 01:11:12,682
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the most interesting date I've ever had.

1029
01:11:16,928 --> 01:11:17,917
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Paul?\n-Robert?

1030
01:11:18,096 --> 01:11:19,586
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yes.\n-You sitting down?

1031
01:11:19,764 --> 01:11:22,756
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yes.\n-You're not gonna believe this.

1032
01:11:22,934 --> 01:11:24,629
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Dave.\n-In a bizarre twist...

1033
01:11:24,803 --> 01:11:26,566
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the hunted has become hunter.

1034
01:11:26,738 --> 01:11:30,435
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}San Francisco Chronicle reporter and Zodiac target Paul Avery...

1035
01:11:30,608 --> 01:11:32,769
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...claims to have uncovered new information...

1036
01:11:32,944 --> 01:11:36,607
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...regarding the only unsolved homicide in Riverside County's history...

1037
01:11:36,781 --> 01:11:40,182
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...a 1966 Southern California murder...

1038
01:11:40,351 --> 01:11:43,946
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that Avery now believes was the Zodiac's first victim.

1039
01:11:44,122 --> 01:11:45,453
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What?\n-He didn't call you?

1040
01:11:45,623 --> 01:11:48,114
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hang on.\n-The Riverside killer wrote to the press...

1041
01:11:48,293 --> 01:11:51,353
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...letters that I took to the Office of Questioned Documents.

1042
01:11:51,529 --> 01:11:53,463
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what did this expert tell you?

1043
01:11:53,631 --> 01:11:55,326
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I knew in my gut, Ron.

1044
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,695
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The handwriting matches Zodiac's.

1045
01:11:57,869 --> 01:11:59,928
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd he get the evidence out of Riverside?

1046
01:12:00,105 --> 01:12:02,403
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He took it to Sherwood without telling us.

1047
01:12:02,574 --> 01:12:06,271
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You know how bad this looks?\n-How do we know that this lead is real?

1048
01:12:06,444 --> 01:12:10,904
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's very real. You know how I know? Because I saw it on TV.

1049
01:12:12,417 --> 01:12:15,784


1050
01:12:17,255 --> 01:12:19,519
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave? Hi.

1051
01:12:19,691 --> 01:12:22,159
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know Mel Nicolai. He's working the case.

1052
01:12:22,327 --> 01:12:23,658
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good to see you again, Mel.

1053
01:12:23,828 --> 01:12:27,127
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can someone explain to me why I'm reading about breaks in this case...

1054
01:12:27,298 --> 01:12:29,289
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...instead of getting calls from you?

1055
01:12:29,467 --> 01:12:31,025
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We got screwed.\n-Dave, come on.

1056
01:12:31,202 --> 01:12:33,636
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do get your name in the paper a lot. People talk.

1057
01:12:33,805 --> 01:12:36,831
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't ever talk about an open investigation, period. Okay, Ken?

1058
01:12:37,008 --> 01:12:40,375
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave? Hey. Hi. Paul Avery.

1059
01:12:40,545 --> 01:12:44,538
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Can I catch a ride with you gents...?\n-Not a good idea, Paul.

1060
01:12:44,716 --> 01:12:48,243
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's gonna make me take a cab when we're going to the same place.

1061
01:12:48,419 --> 01:12:50,751
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for choosing PSA.

1062
01:12:50,922 --> 01:12:53,254
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Fair enough. Fair enough.\n-Please take your seats.

1063
01:12:53,424 --> 01:12:55,949
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, smoking is in the last six aisles only.

1064
01:12:56,127 --> 01:12:58,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enjoy your flight.

1065
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:01,628

01:13:07,882 --> 01:13:10,462
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not at all. I hear you have some files for us.

1070
01:13:10,462 --> 01:13:12,084
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll show you mine. You show me yours.

1071
01:13:12,084 --> 01:13:14,462

1077
01:13:27,207 --> 01:13:30,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She leaves with an unidentified male at closing, 9 p.m.

1078

01:13:34,294 --> 01:13:35,714
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her car is disabled.

1080
01:13:35,714 --> 01:13:38,756
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone cut the coil in the distributor, the battery died.

1081
01:13:38,756 --> 01:13:41,252
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The someone comes back, offers to help.

1082
01:13:41,252 --> 01:13:43,504
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Like Kathleen Johns.\n-Who?

1084
01:13:46,252 --> 01:13:49,882
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Might. Might be. I have her comp right here in this file.

1085
01:13:49,882 --> 01:13:51,168

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...on November 29th, a month after Bates' murder.

1088
01:13:57,354 --> 01:13:59,015
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They ran it.

1089
01:14:00,757 --> 01:14:03,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I'm not sick. I am insane. But that will not stop the game.

1090
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,819
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This should be published for all to read."

1091
01:14:05,996 --> 01:14:09,227
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wants to be published. He calls it a game. This could be our boy.

1092
01:14:09,399 --> 01:14:12,391
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Six months later, the police, the girl's father and the paper...

1093
01:14:12,569 --> 01:14:14,537
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...they all received these.

1094
01:14:19,142 --> 01:14:21,235
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Double postage, just like Zodiac.

1095
01:14:21,411 --> 01:14:22,400


1096
01:14:22,579 --> 01:14:25,446
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are what Sherwood Morrill matched to the Zodiac letters?

1097
01:14:25,615 --> 01:14:27,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These and the desktop. Don.

1098
01:14:27,484 --> 01:14:32,285
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was found a couple of months later by a janitor in RCC storage.

1099
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:41,057


1100
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:44,598
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sherwood got a handwriting match off wood?

1101
01:14:45,502 --> 01:14:47,561
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who etches in their own handwriting?

1102
01:14:47,737 --> 01:14:51,264
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To be honest with you, our letters and your letters, I don't see it.

1103
01:14:51,441 --> 01:14:54,274
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did Paul Avery get his hands on the exemplars?

1104
01:14:54,444 --> 01:14:57,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gave them to him. We talked on the phone for about an hour.

1105
01:14:57,647 --> 01:15:00,844
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And I told him you were gonna be here.\n-You told him we were meeting?

1106
01:15:01,017 --> 01:15:03,451
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I also told him we don't think this is Zodiac.

1107
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:06,521
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, wait a minute. You don't think this is Zodiac?

1108
01:15:06,690 --> 01:15:08,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got a guy we like for it.

1109
01:15:08,358 --> 01:15:11,225
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't have enough to pin him yet, but we're sure it's him.

1110
01:15:11,394 --> 01:15:14,295
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you don't think this is Zodiac, why give anything to Avery?

1111
01:15:14,464 --> 01:15:17,058
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm trying to cooperate.\n-That's how you cooperate...

1112
01:15:17,233 --> 01:15:19,064
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...by giving information to reporters?

1113
01:15:19,235 --> 01:15:22,033
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}About the handwriting, Sherwood says it's a match, right?

1114
01:15:22,205 --> 01:15:25,697
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So let's just say that your guy did Cheri Jo. He types the confession.

1115
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:29,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Zodiac reads it in the paper and writes a letter taking credit for it.

1116
01:15:29,312 --> 01:15:33,339
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Now, that's something he's done before.\n-Look, now you have everything we have.

1117
01:15:33,516 --> 01:15:36,849
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But in my opinion, you guys came south for nothing.

1118
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:39,113
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}FUBAR, gentlemen. FUBAR.

1119
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:41,883
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care what he says. This still could be Z.

1120
01:15:42,058 --> 01:15:45,027
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The problem is the entire state already thinks it is.

1121
01:15:45,195 --> 01:15:48,255
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, there's your press agent. Talk to him about it.

1122
01:15:51,101 --> 01:15:53,296
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I come in peace. I don't want trouble. Dave.

1123
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:56,337
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I don't want to talk to you now.\n-Just trying to do my job.

1124
01:15:56,506 --> 01:15:59,202
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, really? Well, now I can't do mine.

1125
01:15:59,376 --> 01:16:03,073
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're screwed with the amount of tips and you freaked out the entire state.

1126
01:16:03,123 --> 01:16:06,388
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have got Napa, Vallejo, and DOJ looking at me sideways...

1127
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,154
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and Riverside's telling me I'm on a snipe hunt!

1128
01:16:09,329 --> 01:16:11,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheri Jo Bates was a gift. I gave that to you.

1129
01:16:11,665 --> 01:16:13,758
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and Armstrong never would have found her.

1130
01:16:13,934 --> 01:16:16,027
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This might not be Zodiac. That matter to you?

1131
01:16:16,203 --> 01:16:19,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That Riverside may not be able to make a case against their suspect?

1132
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,402
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm out here, beating the bushes, trying to draw him out.

1133
01:16:22,576 --> 01:16:25,306
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We're in this together.\n-We're not in anything together.

1134
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:29,643
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I don't want to up my circulation.\n-Boy. He wrote me. He threatened my life.

1135
01:16:29,816 --> 01:16:33,752
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Bullitt. Been a year and a half, you gonna catch this fucking guy or not?

1136
01:16:37,658 --> 01:16:39,888
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Go fuck yourself.\n-Happily.

1137
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,051
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should have called me, Paul.

1138
01:16:47,601 --> 01:16:49,262
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1139
01:16:52,572 --> 01:16:57,566


1140
01:17:02,115 --> 01:17:03,742
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Did you see this?\n-Unfortunately.

1141
01:17:03,917 --> 01:17:06,715
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here comes every lunatic in California.

1142
01:17:07,554 --> 01:17:10,455
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm the Zodiac.\n-And how did you kill your victims?

1143
01:17:10,624 --> 01:17:13,491
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With a gun. No, with a hammer.

1144
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:16,561
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All I'm authorized to say is he's under government employment.

1145
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:19,563
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And who authorized you?\n-That's all I'm authorized to say.

1146
01:17:19,733 --> 01:17:21,826
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only a little rat bastard like Andre...

1147
01:17:22,002 --> 01:17:24,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...could have cut off all the victims' hands.

1148
01:17:24,471 --> 01:17:26,701
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Zodiac didn't cut off any of the victims' hands.

1149
01:17:26,873 --> 01:17:28,602
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Are you sure?\n-Yes, sir.

1150
01:17:28,775 --> 01:17:31,335
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Travis and I work here side by side for 10 years.

1151
01:17:31,511 --> 01:17:35,174
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His foot gets crushed in an accident and the killings begin.

1152
01:17:35,349 --> 01:17:36,509
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coincidence?

1153
01:17:36,683 --> 01:17:39,083
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I don't know.\n-You're a cop, man. Do the math.

1154
01:17:43,557 --> 01:17:46,856
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you considered the killer might be Paul Avery?

1155
01:17:47,027 --> 01:17:48,392
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frequently.

1156
01:17:48,695 --> 01:17:50,424
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was drinking Coors, getting a load on.

1157
01:17:50,597 --> 01:17:53,862
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Starts talking about hunting people. Like that book.

1158
01:17:54,034 --> 01:17:58,027
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Says how you can put a light at the end of a gun to use as a sight in the dark.

1159
01:17:58,205 --> 01:17:59,433
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He said that?\n-Yeah.

1160
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:01,198


1161
01:18:01,375 --> 01:18:03,172
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I asked, "How would you get away with it?"

1162
01:18:03,343 --> 01:18:07,279
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he said, "It would be easy because there'd be no real motive to the thing."

1163
01:18:07,447 --> 01:18:11,281
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said he'd write letters to the police, call himself Zodiac to mess with them.

1164
01:18:11,451 --> 01:18:15,353
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Leigh liked messing with people.\n-You're positive he said, "Zodiac"?

1165
01:18:15,522 --> 01:18:19,117
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I thought it was a stupid name. So I told him.

1166
01:18:19,292 --> 01:18:22,125
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He got up all upset and said, "I don't care what you think.

1167
01:18:22,295 --> 01:18:25,458
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've thought about it a long time. That's the name I'm gonna use."

1168
01:18:25,632 --> 01:18:28,863
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you feel like he'd been thinking about it a long time?

1169
01:18:29,036 --> 01:18:32,301
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was raw about losing his job at the school.

1170
01:18:32,472 --> 01:18:35,441
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He talked about shooting out the tires of a school bus...

1171
01:18:35,609 --> 01:18:37,907
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and picking off the "little darlings."

1172
01:18:38,078 --> 01:18:41,741
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He actually used those words?\n-That's what made me remember.

1173
01:18:41,915 --> 01:18:46,443
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Afterwards, I told my wife I didn't wanna see him again. And I haven't since.

1174
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:48,781
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Other thing is, Leigh's into skin diving.

1175
01:18:49,222 --> 01:18:51,349
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's been up to that lake a bunch of times.

1176
01:18:51,525 --> 01:18:53,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lake Berryessa? Did you ever go with him?

1177
01:18:53,894 --> 01:18:57,455
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couple times. We went fishing by Putah Creek near there.

1178
01:18:57,631 --> 01:19:01,761
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Tell him when you put it together.\n-About a year ago, in the paper...

1179
01:19:01,935 --> 01:19:04,301
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...there was a story about the Zodiac.

1180
01:19:04,471 --> 01:19:07,133
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it all comes back. I tried to call the local cops...

1181
01:19:07,307 --> 01:19:10,299
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Blew him off. Thought he was a nut.\n-And you're sure...

1182
01:19:10,477 --> 01:19:12,809
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the conversation you had about Zodiac...

1183
01:19:12,979 --> 01:19:16,881
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...took place on January 1st, 1968?

1184
01:19:17,050 --> 01:19:18,608
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It couldn't have been any later.

1185
01:19:18,785 --> 01:19:23,586
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I started a new job in L.A. on January 20th. I had to move.

1186
01:19:23,757 --> 01:19:26,248
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-This is my problem. This guy....\n-Arthur Leigh Allen?

1187
01:19:26,426 --> 01:19:30,419
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This guy just lays out his entire evil plan to a fishing buddy on New Year's Day?

1188
01:19:30,597 --> 01:19:32,895
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. He's angry. He's been drinking.

1189
01:19:33,066 --> 01:19:35,557
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Been thinking about it for a while. I can buy that.

1190
01:19:35,735 --> 01:19:37,965
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So why didn't Cheney contact us sooner?

1191
01:19:38,138 --> 01:19:39,628
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I checked. He did.

1192
01:19:39,806 --> 01:19:42,934
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First recorded contact with the police department about Allen...

1193
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:46,671
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...was in Pomona, January 10th, 1970. He just got lost in the shuffle.

1194
01:19:46,847 --> 01:19:49,941
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did Cheney have anything against Allen? Did Allen screw his wife?

1195
01:19:50,117 --> 01:19:54,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna do a full background check. But I gotta tell you, I like this guy.

1196
01:19:55,455 --> 01:19:57,616
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So let's pull some handwriting samples.

1197
01:19:59,126 --> 01:20:02,391
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. I talked to Sherwood. He got the samples.

1198
01:20:02,562 --> 01:20:04,996
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What are you having?\n-BLT.

1199
01:20:06,867 --> 01:20:09,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The check stubs are a wash. There's not enough handwriting.

1200
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:12,532
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The application's got more, but he can't rule him in.

1201
01:20:12,706 --> 01:20:14,367
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he can't rule him out, either.

1202
01:20:14,541 --> 01:20:17,874
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Well, that's vague.\n-He needs more samples.

1203
01:20:18,411 --> 01:20:22,905
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Also, our guy is a pervert. When Mel got the application from Valley Springs...

1204
01:20:23,083 --> 01:20:25,745
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...they told him Allen had been fired for touching kids.

1205
01:20:25,919 --> 01:20:29,013
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-"Touching"?\n-Polite euphemism.

1206
01:20:29,756 --> 01:20:33,021
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-So, what do you wanna do?\n-Make some phone calls.

1207
01:20:33,193 --> 01:20:35,684
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Are you done with the fries?\n-Go ahead.

1208
01:20:35,862 --> 01:20:39,593
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you have a chance to look at the copies of the Zodiac letters we sent?

1209
01:20:39,766 --> 01:20:43,167
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Some of this stuff is pretty creepy.

1210
01:20:43,336 --> 01:20:45,668
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah, we know.\n-I mean creepy like Leigh.

1211
01:20:45,839 --> 01:20:48,467
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He misspells words like that. He thinks it's funny.

1212
01:20:48,642 --> 01:20:50,075
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the handwriting?

1213
01:20:50,243 --> 01:20:53,041
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Don't you have experts for that stuff?

1214
01:20:53,213 --> 01:20:56,205
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our man at Questioned Documents says it's inconclusive.

1215
01:20:56,383 --> 01:20:58,283
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe he did it with his other hand.

1216
01:20:58,451 --> 01:21:02,319
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The letters are too neat for someone to have written with the wrong hand.

1217
01:21:02,489 --> 01:21:04,889
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-But not for Leigh, right?\n-What do you mean?

1218
01:21:05,058 --> 01:21:09,586
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's ambidextrous. He can write with either hand. Didn't you guys know that?

1219
01:21:09,763 --> 01:21:12,095
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In everyday life, Allen uses his left hand.

1220
01:21:12,265 --> 01:21:15,098
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Job applications, letters to friends, et cetera.

1221
01:21:15,268 --> 01:21:17,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he writes the Zodiac letters with his right hand...

1222
01:21:18,104 --> 01:21:21,733
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...producing a different handwriting that he can't be linked to.

1223
01:21:21,908 --> 01:21:24,172
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We gotta see this guy, chief.\n-Where is he?

1224
01:21:24,344 --> 01:21:28,075
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vallejo. He works at Union Oil in Pinole. His brother's up there too.

1225
01:21:28,248 --> 01:21:32,014
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See them both. Make sure you call Mulanax. It is his backyard.

1226
01:21:32,185 --> 01:21:35,211
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, right, because that worked so well for us in Riverside.

1227
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:38,013
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cooperation, that's us, at all costs.

1228
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:45,058


1229
01:21:48,001 --> 01:21:49,628
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can talk to him in here.

1230
01:21:49,803 --> 01:21:52,328
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coke machine's busted, by the way.

1231
01:21:52,939 --> 01:21:54,907
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll go get him for you.

1232
01:21:56,109 --> 01:21:58,407
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how do you guys wanna do this?

1233
01:21:58,578 --> 01:22:01,411
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Bill talked to the informants. He leads, we follow?

1234
01:22:02,215 --> 01:22:03,944
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay by me.

1235
01:22:17,697 --> 01:22:21,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Allen, I'm Inspector Bill Armstrong. This is Inspector Dave Toschi...

1236
01:22:21,534 --> 01:22:23,195
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and Sergeant Jack Mulanax.

1237
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:27,568
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're investigating the Zodiac murders in San Francisco and Vallejo.

1238
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:29,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please sit down.

1239
01:22:38,385 --> 01:22:41,047
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The informant notified us you made certain statements...

1240
01:22:41,221 --> 01:22:43,712
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...eleven months prior to the first Zodiac murder.

1241
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:46,415
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they're true, they're quite incriminating.

1242
01:22:46,593 --> 01:22:49,585
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You recall having any such conversation?\n-No.

1243
01:22:49,763 --> 01:22:52,357
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you ever read or heard anything about the Zodiac?

1244
01:22:52,532 --> 01:22:55,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When it was first in the paper, but I didn't follow it after.

1245
01:22:55,835 --> 01:22:57,234
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not?

1246
01:22:57,404 --> 01:22:59,201
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too morbid.

1247
01:22:59,372 --> 01:23:01,465
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told all this to the other officer.

1248
01:23:02,409 --> 01:23:04,673
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Which other officer?\n-From Vallejo.

1249
01:23:06,012 --> 01:23:07,604
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you remember his name?

1250
01:23:07,781 --> 01:23:11,114
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, but it was right after the murder at the lake.

1251
01:23:11,284 --> 01:23:13,752
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what did you tell this officer?

1252
01:23:15,689 --> 01:23:20,388
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told him that I'd gone to Salt Point that weekend to skin dive...

1253
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,256
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that I was alone but I met a couple there.

1254
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:25,891
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have their names at home if you want them.

1255
01:23:26,066 --> 01:23:29,001
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That would be great, Arthur.\n-Leigh.

1256
01:23:29,169 --> 01:23:33,868
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What?\n-Leigh. Nobody calls me Arthur.

1257
01:23:34,808 --> 01:23:37,936
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Also, that day when I came home, my neighbor saw me.

1258
01:23:38,111 --> 01:23:42,138
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was around 4. But I forgot to tell the other officer that.

1259
01:23:42,315 --> 01:23:44,943
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Neighbor's name?\n-Bill White.

1260
01:23:46,152 --> 01:23:48,052
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He died a week or so afterwards.

1261
01:23:48,221 --> 01:23:51,588
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heart attack. So I didn't think to call to follow up.

1262
01:23:53,526 --> 01:23:55,994
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The knives I had in my car with the blood on them...

1263
01:23:56,162 --> 01:23:58,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that blood came from a chicken that I killed for dinner.

1264
01:24:02,302 --> 01:24:05,032
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What?\n-I had knives in my car that weekend.

1265
01:24:05,205 --> 01:24:09,539
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe Bill saw them and called the other officer on me.

1266
01:24:10,243 --> 01:24:12,643
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we'll be checking in on that.

1267
01:24:12,812 --> 01:24:14,712
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, let me ask you something else.

1268
01:24:14,881 --> 01:24:19,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Were you ever in Southern California at any time in 1966?

1269
01:24:19,419 --> 01:24:21,444
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this about the Riverside killing?

1270
01:24:21,621 --> 01:24:23,316
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

1271
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:27,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I guess I was there around that time. I used to go down there a lot.

1272
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:29,792
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like the auto races.

1273
01:24:33,466 --> 01:24:35,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Informant says that you're ambidextrous?

1274
01:24:36,069 --> 01:24:37,798
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, that's untrue.

1275
01:24:37,971 --> 01:24:40,337
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't write with both hands?

1276
01:24:41,541 --> 01:24:43,805
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My teachers tried to make me when I was a kid...

1277
01:24:43,977 --> 01:24:46,639
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but I couldn't. I'm left-handed.

1278
01:24:46,813 --> 01:24:50,249
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He also said that you made statements about killing school children.

1279
01:24:51,751 --> 01:24:53,981
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is... That is horrible.

1280
01:24:54,154 --> 01:24:56,588
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is... That's a horrible thing to say.

1281
01:24:56,756 --> 01:24:59,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you weren't angry about being fired from Valley Springs...

1282
01:25:00,026 --> 01:25:01,994
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...for touching your students?

1283
01:25:11,571 --> 01:25:13,903
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not the Zodiac.

1284
01:25:14,274 --> 01:25:17,471
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if I was, I certainly wouldn't tell you.

1285
01:25:19,779 --> 01:25:22,009
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a nice watch.

1286
01:25:23,082 --> 01:25:25,141
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Thank you.\n-May I see it?

1287
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:29,281
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May I see it?

1288
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where'd you get it?

1289
01:25:41,835 --> 01:25:42,824


1290
01:25:43,002 --> 01:25:45,163
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A Christmas gift from my mother two years ago.

1291
01:25:45,338 --> 01:25:46,771
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's very sweet.

1292
01:25:46,973 --> 01:25:49,305
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So tell me something, Arthur.

1293
01:25:49,809 --> 01:25:54,473
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't remember anyone you might have had a conversation with regarding Zodiac?

1294
01:25:56,082 --> 01:26:02,385
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe Ted Kidder or Phil Tucker at Vallejo Recreation.

1295
01:26:02,655 --> 01:26:06,591
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I couldn't be positive. I used to work there...

1296
01:26:10,463 --> 01:26:13,023
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Most Dangerous Game.

1297
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,934
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What?\n-The Most Dangerous Game.

1298
01:26:16,102 --> 01:26:19,594
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why you're here, isn't it? It was my favorite book in high school.

1299
01:26:19,772 --> 01:26:23,264
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's about this man who waits for people to get shipwrecked on his island.

1300
01:26:23,443 --> 01:26:26,776
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was tired of hunting animals, he hunted people for the challenge.

1301
01:26:26,946 --> 01:26:30,279
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And "Man is the most dangerous animal of all"?

1302
01:26:31,184 --> 01:26:33,277
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the whole point of the story.

1303
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,685
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great book.

1304
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:39,552
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or at least that's what I told Phil.

1305
01:26:45,164 --> 01:26:47,029
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May I go?

1306
01:26:50,069 --> 01:26:51,434
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure.

1307
01:26:55,975 --> 01:26:59,809
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Thanks for your time.\n-I'm willing to help in any way possible.

1308
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:02,245
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I look forward to the day...

1309
01:27:02,415 --> 01:27:06,146
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...when police officers are no longer referred to as "pigs."

1310
01:27:06,953 --> 01:27:08,682
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

1311
01:27:09,255 --> 01:27:10,745
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll be in touch.

1312
01:27:22,669 --> 01:27:26,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So does anyone think this suspect warrants further investigation?

1313
01:27:26,739 --> 01:27:29,799
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are copies of some of the Zodiac letters that were sent.

1314
01:27:29,976 --> 01:27:31,238


1315
01:27:31,411 --> 01:27:33,106
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'd like you to take a look at them.

1316
01:27:33,613 --> 01:27:35,638
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think my brother's the Zodiac.

1317
01:27:35,815 --> 01:27:39,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Well, we're looking at him.\n-Are you going to arrest him?

1318
01:27:39,252 --> 01:27:43,018
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Allen, we don't arrest people just because we're interested in them.

1319
01:27:43,189 --> 01:27:46,852
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Well, Leigh's always been troubled.\n-Is it true about the children?

1320
01:27:47,527 --> 01:27:51,463
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unfortunately. We don't see him much anymore since we found out.

1321
01:27:51,631 --> 01:27:53,895
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are your feelings about Don Cheney?

1322
01:27:54,067 --> 01:27:57,332
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don Cheney? My old roommate? Was he the one who contacted you?

1323
01:27:57,503 --> 01:28:00,802
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That's confidential.\n-Well, Don's a very reliable guy.

1324
01:28:00,974 --> 01:28:04,137
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he were to tell you something, I'd believe it to be true.

1325
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:05,504
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-This one.\n-What about it?

1326
01:28:05,678 --> 01:28:07,669
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, he spells Christmas with two S's.

1327
01:28:07,847 --> 01:28:11,874
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got a Christmas card from Leigh years ago. He spelled it the same way.

1328
01:28:12,051 --> 01:28:14,451
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-"Christ-mass."\n-Would you still have that?

1329
01:28:14,621 --> 01:28:17,351
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I can look for it.\n-Thank you. That'd be great.

1330
01:28:18,925 --> 01:28:20,916
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there anything else we can do to help?

1331
01:28:21,094 --> 01:28:23,927
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brother said he'd search Leigh's apartment next time he went.

1332
01:28:24,097 --> 01:28:26,429
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Gets you around the warrant.\n-For the time being.

1333
01:28:26,599 --> 01:28:27,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we do find something...

1334
01:28:28,101 --> 01:28:31,537
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Mulanax will go to the DA and we could search the place properly.

1335
01:28:31,704 --> 01:28:35,731
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I talked to the cop who interviewed Allen two days after the Berryessa murders.

1336
01:28:35,908 --> 01:28:39,708
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't remember how he got onto him, but didn't think he looked like a killer...

1337
01:28:39,879 --> 01:28:42,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-...so he didn't like him for Z.\n-But you do?

1338
01:28:42,215 --> 01:28:45,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I wish I could've taken the guy in there.\n-Take it slow, Dave.

1339
01:28:45,652 --> 01:28:49,144
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find more stuff for Sherwood. A match will get us farther on the warrants.

1340
01:28:49,322 --> 01:28:52,314
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Avery's on 2.\n-Tell him to screw.

1341
01:28:52,492 --> 01:28:56,428
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want me to communicate that verbatim or can I spice it up a little?

1342
01:29:06,630 --> 01:29:08,084
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Christ, kid.

1343
01:29:09,714 --> 01:29:10,756
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1344
01:29:10,756 --> 01:29:13,168
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Paul, I've been thinking...\n-Oh, God save us all.

1345
01:29:13,168 --> 01:29:14,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The letter to Melvin Belli

1346
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:17,672
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was sent exactly one year after the Lake Herman Road murder.

1347
01:29:17,672 --> 01:29:19,504
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the one to Cheri Jo Bates' father

1348
01:29:19,504 --> 01:29:21,966
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was sent exactly six months after her death.

1349
01:29:21,966 --> 01:29:24,378
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-She was killed a day before Halloween.\n-Yeah.

1350
01:29:24,378 --> 01:29:25,966
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you received a Halloween card...

1351
01:29:25,966 --> 01:29:28,672
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, these are all fascinating pieces of news, Robert,

1352
01:29:28,672 --> 01:29:30,714
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's a bit early in the day.

1353
01:29:30,714 --> 01:29:33,588
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paul, it's 11:00 and we missed Editorial.

1354
01:29:38,168 --> 01:29:40,294
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up.\n-No, no, no.

1355
01:29:40,294 --> 01:29:41,504
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I just thought that...\n-No, no, no.

1356
01:29:47,129 --> 01:29:50,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This suspect is not your Zodiac.

1357
01:29:51,433 --> 01:29:54,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This sample matches the canceled checks and the application?

1358
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:57,131
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Perfectly.\n-So we've retested the left hand.

1359
01:29:57,305 --> 01:29:59,432
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We know he's ambidextrous.\n-In 38 years...

1360
01:29:59,608 --> 01:30:01,769
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I've never seen anyone that ambidextrous.

1361
01:30:01,943 --> 01:30:03,911
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Both hands would have commonalities.

1362
01:30:04,946 --> 01:30:08,382
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. Just not gonna work.

1363
01:30:10,285 --> 01:30:12,617
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Homicide, Toschi.\n-Dave, it's Jack Mulanax.

1364
01:30:12,788 --> 01:30:14,949
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, Mulanax. Yeah?

1365
01:30:15,123 --> 01:30:18,183
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We struck out with the judge. He won't sign off on a warrant.

1366
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,021
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why not?\n-Said it wasn't enough.

1367
01:30:20,195 --> 01:30:22,993
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unless we bring him a handwriting match or some evidence...

1368
01:30:23,165 --> 01:30:25,065
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, how are we gonna get evidence?

1369
01:30:25,233 --> 01:30:26,962
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

1370
01:30:27,135 --> 01:30:30,502
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I truly am sorry.\n-No, I know. I thank you, Jack.

1371
01:30:32,007 --> 01:30:34,339
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What do you wanna do?\n-Don't know what I can do.

1372
01:30:34,509 --> 01:30:37,535
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need Allen's right hand. We can't get it without a warrant.

1373
01:30:37,712 --> 01:30:39,839
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are there other guys you should be looking at?

1374
01:30:40,015 --> 01:30:43,246
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Only, what...?\n-Twenty-three hundred?

1375
01:30:43,885 --> 01:30:45,352
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, then.

1376
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:50,148
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, then.

1377
01:31:17,652 --> 01:31:20,348
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paul, you wrote the Justice Department...

1378
01:31:20,522 --> 01:31:24,117
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...asking to be put in charge of the Zodiac investigation?

1379
01:31:24,292 --> 01:31:25,987


1380
01:31:26,161 --> 01:31:28,686
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I merely suggested...\n-On our letterhead?

1381
01:31:28,864 --> 01:31:32,823
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that those with knowledge of the case create an information clearinghouse...

1382
01:31:33,001 --> 01:31:35,333
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to promote an exchange and free flow of ideas.

1383
01:31:35,503 --> 01:31:38,267
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And that you run it.\n-Well, who better than me?

1384
01:31:39,574 --> 01:31:40,802
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The marked man.

1385
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:45,541
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paul, if you wanna work here, I need three things: One, stop boozing.

1386
01:31:45,714 --> 01:31:48,706
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two, stop doing whatever else it is you're doing.

1387
01:31:48,884 --> 01:31:52,115
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And three, cut this nonsense out.

1388
01:31:52,287 --> 01:31:55,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetest of Templetons, if at any time...

1389
01:31:55,624 --> 01:32:00,823
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you feel my excellent work is no longer in step with this trashy provincial rag...

1390
01:32:00,996 --> 01:32:02,588
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I'll more than happily...

1391
01:32:02,764 --> 01:32:05,892
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More than happily decamp for greener pastures.

1392
01:32:06,067 --> 01:32:07,898
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paul, I mean it.

1393
01:32:18,013 --> 01:32:19,913
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Paul?\n-Yep?

1394
01:32:20,115 --> 01:32:21,582
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that?

1395
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:24,116
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An editorial tete-a-tete.

1396

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Wanna grab a drink?\n-It's 10 in the morning.

01:32:34,029 --> 01:32:35,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?

1399
01:32:36,431 --> 01:32:37,762
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

01:32:40,902 --> 01:32:42,733
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for asking.

1401
01:32:45,006 --> 01:32:46,166
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Shorty!\n-Yes?

1402
01:32:46,341 --> 01:32:49,276
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Let's go out for one.\n-Paul, where are you going?

1403
01:32:51,212 --> 01:32:52,941
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you moved off my brother-in-law?

1404
01:32:53,815 --> 01:32:55,908
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We couldn't get a warrant.

1405
01:32:56,084 --> 01:32:57,483


1406
01:32:57,652 --> 01:33:00,712
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last year we arranged for Leigh to get help from a social worker.

1407
01:33:00,889 --> 01:33:05,588
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He only went twice. We saw him recently for the first time in nine months.

1408
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,729
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mother-in-law brought him by to see the new baby.

1409
01:33:08,897 --> 01:33:11,889
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After he left, I went to see that social worker.

1410
01:33:12,067 --> 01:33:15,036
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He couldn't talk about a former patient, so I just asked him...

1411
01:33:15,203 --> 01:33:17,831
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...if he thought Leigh was capable of killing people.

1412
01:33:18,006 --> 01:33:21,339
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Because of patient confidentiality...\n-The man said yes.

1413
01:33:23,078 --> 01:33:27,139
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why hadn't you seen him in nine months?\n-He's going to school in Santa Rosa.

1414
01:33:27,315 --> 01:33:30,751
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Santa Rosa? Where is he living?\n-In his trailer.

1415
01:33:30,919 --> 01:33:32,648
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-In Santa Rosa?\n-Sonoma County.

1416
01:33:32,821 --> 01:33:35,016
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We wouldn't have to go through the Vallejo DA.

1417
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:38,216
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been 11 months and now you wanna search his trailer?

1418
01:33:38,393 --> 01:33:40,054
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we find something, great.

1419
01:33:40,228 --> 01:33:43,391
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If not, we get his prints and handwriting samples from both hands.

1420
01:33:43,565 --> 01:33:45,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought Sherwood shut you down.

1421
01:33:46,768 --> 01:33:48,929
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if I can get a second opinion?

1422
01:33:50,338 --> 01:33:52,772
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna step on Sherwood's toes. He trained me.

1423
01:33:52,941 --> 01:33:55,671
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All I need to know is if the suspect is ambidextrous...

1424
01:33:55,844 --> 01:33:59,678
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...could he possibly have written those letters with his other hand?

1425
01:34:00,982 --> 01:34:02,108
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Between you and me?

1426
01:34:02,283 --> 01:34:05,684
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because there are differing schools of thought on this....

1427
01:34:07,389 --> 01:34:11,223
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the samples of his other hand. If he's the Zodiac, you'll get a match.

1428
01:34:11,393 --> 01:34:14,191
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the current thinking, according to Terry Pascoe.

1429
01:34:14,362 --> 01:34:17,126
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I spoke to a psychologist who'd be willing to testify...

1430
01:34:17,298 --> 01:34:20,461
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that someone who undergoes a personality change like Zodiac...

1431
01:34:20,635 --> 01:34:23,468
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...would manifest it physically, altering his handwriting.

1432
01:34:23,638 --> 01:34:27,233
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which is why Sherwood couldn't get a match from Allen's samples.

1433
01:34:27,409 --> 01:34:29,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got Terry Pascoe, this psychology guy...

1434
01:34:29,744 --> 01:34:32,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...coupled with Cheney, it could be enough for a warrant.

1435
01:34:32,614 --> 01:34:33,945
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Get Cheney on the record.\n-"...and shoot the kiddies as they came bouncing out...

1436
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:38,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and that he would call himself 'Zodiac.'"

1437
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:40,639
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yes.\n-And you're willing to swear to this...

1438
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:42,742
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...under oath, in superior court?

1439
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:44,241
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Without any hesitation.

1440
01:34:44,412 --> 01:34:47,643
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you very much, Mr. Cheney. Thank you very much for your time.

1441
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:49,214
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen.

1442
01:34:49,924 --> 01:34:53,756
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lives in Sunset Trailer Court in Santa Rosa, California.

1443
01:34:53,756 --> 01:34:55,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Physical description.

1444
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:57,756
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Allen is similar in height, weight and build

1445
01:34:57,756 --> 01:35:00,966
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to a man seen at Lake Berryessa on the day of the stabbings.

1446
01:35:00,966 --> 01:35:03,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand he doesn't look much like the San Francisco composite.

1447
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,462
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}True. Height and weight are sketchy,

1448
01:35:05,504 --> 01:35:07,798
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but lumbering Caucasian with a crew cut is right on.

1449
01:35:07,798 --> 01:35:10,168
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We never had much confidence in the composite from the kids.

1450
01:35:10,168 --> 01:35:12,294
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The patrolman who say Zodiac that night

1451
01:35:12,294 --> 01:35:13,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}said he didn't look much like the sketch.

1452
01:35:13,882 --> 01:35:15,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Military boot prints.

1453
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:18,252
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Allen was in the Navy. Wears a size 10-and-a-half.

1454
01:35:18,252 --> 01:35:20,798
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Same size as the prints found at Berryessa.

1455
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:22,588
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about gun?

1456
01:35:22,588 --> 01:35:27,252
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheney says Allen owns several firearms. We'll list them in the warrant.

1457
01:35:27,252 --> 01:35:30,126
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And the ciphers.\n-Could be code training in the Navy,

1458
01:35:30,126 --> 01:35:32,966
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and people have seen Allen with ciphers in the past.

1459
01:35:32,966 --> 01:35:34,084
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? Who?

1460
01:35:34,084 --> 01:35:36,966
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That would be his sister-in-law and a man named Phil Tucker

1461
01:35:36,966 --> 01:35:39,378
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that he worked with at a public pool in Vallejo.

1462
01:35:39,378 --> 01:35:42,966
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Phil Tucker told us about a conversation that he had with Allen

1463
01:35:42,966 --> 01:35:45,756
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about how to attach a flashlight to the barrel of a gun.

1464
01:35:45,756 --> 01:35:49,084
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That gives us two sources on the ciphers and two on the flashlight.

1465
01:35:49,084 --> 01:35:51,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about his threats on children?

1466
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:53,042
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Suspect worked for elementary schools

1467
01:35:53,042 --> 01:35:56,378
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and was fired for molestation in March, April '68.

1468
01:35:56,378 --> 01:35:59,084
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Could give him motive.\n-At the very least, it's home turf.

1469
01:35:59,084 --> 01:36:01,252
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'd have knowledge of bus routes,

1470
01:36:01,252 --> 01:36:03,798
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which the two major threats centered around.

1471
01:36:03,798 --> 01:36:05,546
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the bomb?

1472
01:36:06,966 --> 01:36:09,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Allen works as a chemist.

1473
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,546
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take him through the geography.

1474
01:36:10,546 --> 01:36:12,126
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vallejo murders.

1475
01:36:12,126 --> 01:36:15,714
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Allen lives in Vallejo with his mother in her basement.

1476
01:36:15,714 --> 01:36:19,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Berryessa murder. On the day that the two kids were stabbed

1477
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,756
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}his neighbor saw bloody knives in his truck

1478
01:36:21,756 --> 01:36:24,756
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which he claimed were used to kill a chicken.

1479
01:36:24,756 --> 01:36:26,714
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does he have any alibis?

1480
01:36:26,714 --> 01:36:29,462
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He claimed he did, but he's been unable to produce the names

1481
01:36:29,462 --> 01:36:32,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of the couple he supposedly met on the day of Berryessa.

1482
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:35,294
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The bottom line is that Allen can't alibi up on anything.

1483
01:36:35,294 --> 01:36:37,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Riverside, Vallejo, the lake or us.

1484
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:39,504
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You want to tell me about the name?\n-What name?

1485
01:36:39,504 --> 01:36:40,714
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Zodiac.

1486
01:36:40,714 --> 01:36:44,714
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Allen wears a watch that bears both the word and crosshair symbol.

1487
01:36:44,714 --> 01:36:46,168
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he mentioned Zodiac to Cheney

1488
01:36:46,168 --> 01:36:48,756
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a year and a half before it appeared in any letter.

1489
01:36:51,924 --> 01:36:54,462
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-John...\n-That's pretty good, guys.

1490
01:36:54,462 --> 01:36:57,462
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We think so, too.\n-Let's take it to a judge.

1491
01:36:58,488 --> 01:37:05,052


1492
01:37:17,641 --> 01:37:18,972
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Allen?

1493
01:37:19,142 --> 01:37:23,476
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the Santa Rosa Police Department. We have a warrant to search your residence.

1494
01:37:34,858 --> 01:37:36,189
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

1495
01:37:44,834 --> 01:37:46,734
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll check with the neighbors.

1496
01:37:48,371 --> 01:37:49,861
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Close the door.\n-Close the door.

1497
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:52,099
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's rodents running around.

1498
01:38:04,754 --> 01:38:07,279
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neighbor said he tore out of here about half-hour ago.

1499
01:38:07,457 --> 01:38:10,949
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You think somebody tipped him?\n-We're not leaving till he comes back.

1500
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:18,831
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll check the back.

1501
01:38:32,115 --> 01:38:33,844
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Jesus.\n-What?

1502
01:38:34,017 --> 01:38:35,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Squirrels.

1503
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:38,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Piece of work, this guy.

1504
01:38:45,829 --> 01:38:48,024
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not one, but two blue windbreakers.

1505
01:38:48,198 --> 01:38:51,759
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Like the Stine scene?\n-We'll have those checked for blood.

1506
01:38:52,869 --> 01:38:56,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And a pair of black gloves.

1507
01:38:57,007 --> 01:39:00,101
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Men's 7, just like the ones we found in the cab.

1508
01:39:00,710 --> 01:39:03,144
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, he's got the same size shoes and gloves as Z.

1509
01:39:03,313 --> 01:39:05,338
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably just a coincidence.

1510
01:39:05,515 --> 01:39:10,145

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'll flip you for it.\n-You wish.

1613
01:46:25,809 --> 01:46:28,801
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody has more Zodiac crap than you do.

1614
01:46:36,286 --> 01:46:37,878


1615
01:46:40,190 --> 01:46:41,384


1616
01:46:42,192 --> 01:46:43,386


1617
01:47:13,090 --> 01:47:15,524
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Are you kidding me?\n-Hi, Paul.

1618
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:19,124
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Permission to come aboard.

1619
01:47:19,296 --> 01:47:22,197
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right there. You got shoes on. This is perfect right here.

1620
01:47:22,366 --> 01:47:24,766
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That's the one.\n-Okay.

1621
01:47:25,769 --> 01:47:27,498
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See that? Mesmerizing.

1622
01:47:27,671 --> 01:47:31,767
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. My own kids would kill me for one of those.

1623
01:47:33,143 --> 01:47:35,634
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How are you?\n-Fantastic.

1624
01:47:35,812 --> 01:47:40,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, admittedly, the Bee ain't exactly the Chron, but fuck it, right?

1625
01:47:40,183 --> 01:47:43,118
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want a drink? I don't have anything blue, but I got....

1626
01:47:43,287 --> 01:47:45,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry about that. Don't worry about it.

1627
01:47:45,555 --> 01:47:49,013
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's no bother at all. Nobody comes by from the old days.

1628
01:47:49,192 --> 01:47:50,454
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheers.

1629
01:47:51,061 --> 01:47:53,427
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To your health and mine.

1630
01:47:55,165 --> 01:47:57,065
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mostly mine.

1631
01:48:05,442 --> 01:48:06,773
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what's new?

1632
01:48:08,779 --> 01:48:11,805
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been thinking. Somebody should write a book.

1633
01:48:11,982 --> 01:48:15,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody should write a fucking book, that's for sure.

1634
01:48:15,285 --> 01:48:17,845
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-About what?\n-About Zodiac.

1635
01:48:18,789 --> 01:48:20,279
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not new.

1636
01:48:20,457 --> 01:48:24,359
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been thinking that if you put all the information together...

1637
01:48:24,528 --> 01:48:27,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...maybe you could jog something loose. And I was thinking...

1638
01:48:27,698 --> 01:48:30,633
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-...you know the case best.\n-Yeah. That's true.

1639
01:48:30,801 --> 01:48:33,634
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you know all the players and you have all the files.

1640
01:48:33,804 --> 01:48:36,534
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Lost them.\n-You lost them?

1641
01:48:36,707 --> 01:48:40,165
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or I tossed them. I don't know. I moved onto a boat.

1642
01:48:40,344 --> 01:48:43,404
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know that we work in the daily business, right? As in, today?

1643
01:48:43,580 --> 01:48:45,878
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think we were doing back then?

1644
01:48:47,584 --> 01:48:50,451
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More people die in the East Bay commute every three months...

1645
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:52,087
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...than that idiot ever killed.

1646
01:48:52,255 --> 01:48:56,555
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He offed a few citizens and he wrote a few letters and he faded into a footnote.

1647
01:49:02,499 --> 01:49:06,799
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not that I haven't been sitting here idly waiting for you to drop by...

1648
01:49:06,970 --> 01:49:09,803
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and reinvigorate my sense of purpose.

1649
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:14,402
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was four years ago. Let it fucking go.

1650
01:49:14,745 --> 01:49:17,873
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're wrong. It was important.

1651
01:49:19,049 --> 01:49:21,244
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then what did you ever do about it...

1652
01:49:22,319 --> 01:49:24,651
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...if it was so important? What did you ever do?

1653
01:49:24,821 --> 01:49:27,346
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You hovered over my desk, you stole from wastebaskets.

1654
01:49:27,524 --> 01:49:29,185
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I being unkind?

1655
01:49:30,327 --> 01:49:34,559
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that's right, I forgot. You went to the library.

1656
01:49:36,466 --> 01:49:38,525
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry I bothered you.

1657
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:02,483
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hey, hi.\n-Hi.

1658
01:50:02,659 --> 01:50:05,685
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Where you been?\n-The library.

1659
01:50:14,571 --> 01:50:19,565


1660
01:50:36,793 --> 01:50:38,454
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1661
01:50:53,844 --> 01:50:57,575
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Inspector Toschi?\n-Yeah? One moment, please.

1662
01:51:01,585 --> 01:51:03,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hi.\n-Hi.

1663
01:51:04,321 --> 01:51:06,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We met at the movies once.

1664
01:51:06,656 --> 01:51:09,022
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It must have been magical.\n-I'm Robert Graysmith.

1665
01:51:09,192 --> 01:51:12,525
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I work at the Chronicle. I was wondering if I could buy you lunch.

1666
01:51:14,364 --> 01:51:15,626
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure, why not?

1667
01:51:15,799 --> 01:51:18,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you're a friend of Paul Avery's?

1668
01:51:18,869 --> 01:51:21,167
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's actually the reason I'm here.

1669
01:51:22,772 --> 01:51:24,672
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted to ask you about Zodiac.

1670
01:51:25,542 --> 01:51:28,568
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I appreciate the interest, but we don't discuss open cases.

1671
01:51:28,745 --> 01:51:31,043
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, well, what's going on with it, day-to-day?

1672
01:51:31,214 --> 01:51:33,512
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're actively pursuing all leads.

1673
01:51:33,683 --> 01:51:36,652
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're the only one on it, right?

1674
01:51:37,087 --> 01:51:38,816
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Graysmith...

1675
01:51:39,389 --> 01:51:41,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Zodiac hasn't written in three years.

1676
01:51:41,558 --> 01:51:44,356
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how many murders we've had in San Francisco since?

1677
01:51:44,528 --> 01:51:46,018
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No.\n-Over 200.

1678
01:51:46,196 --> 01:51:49,222
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a lot of dead people and grieving families that need help.

1679
01:51:49,399 --> 01:51:50,923
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So nobody cares.

1680
01:51:51,101 --> 01:51:54,036
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me? I care.

1681
01:51:56,373 --> 01:51:58,603
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Can I show you something?

1682
01:52:01,545 --> 01:52:04,673
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been doing research on the first cipher.

1683
01:52:04,848 --> 01:52:09,785
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything an amateur would need to create it can be found in these books.

1684
01:52:09,953 --> 01:52:13,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I started thinking that if you can track these books...

1685
01:52:13,323 --> 01:52:15,257
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...then maybe you could track the man.

1686
01:52:16,159 --> 01:52:18,889
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I remember you thought that Zodiac was military...

1687
01:52:19,062 --> 01:52:22,623
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so I went to every base library and I got a list of every person...

1688
01:52:22,799 --> 01:52:26,792
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...who's ever checked out these books and that's when I found this.

1689
01:52:31,641 --> 01:52:34,132
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Missing.\n-It means they were stolen.

1690
01:52:34,744 --> 01:52:38,441
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So almost every book on ciphers was stolen from the Presidio Library?

1691
01:52:38,615 --> 01:52:40,708
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the Oakland Army Terminal Library.

1692
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:47,751
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody didn't want a record of ever having checked out these books.

1693
01:52:48,592 --> 01:52:50,617
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you again?

1694
01:52:52,329 --> 01:52:54,388
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanna help.

1695
01:52:57,167 --> 01:52:59,192
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't allow you to help.

1696
01:52:59,369 --> 01:53:02,463
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't discuss the case with you. I can't give you information...

1697
01:53:02,639 --> 01:53:06,405
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I certainly couldn't tell you to go see Ken Narlow in Napa.

1698
01:53:06,576 --> 01:53:07,907
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}N-A-R-L-O-W.

1699
01:53:17,954 --> 01:53:22,823
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Mr. Graysmith, but we don't cooperate with writers.

1700
01:53:22,993 --> 01:53:25,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm not a writer, I'm a cartoonist.

1701
01:53:26,529 --> 01:53:28,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And Dave Toschi sent you?\n-Yes.

1702
01:53:28,865 --> 01:53:30,594
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why?\n-Maybe he...

1703
01:53:30,767 --> 01:53:32,928
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe he thought that I could do some good.

1704
01:53:34,337 --> 01:53:39,104
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What are you, some kind of boy scout?\n-Eagle Scout, actually. First class.

1705
01:53:39,542 --> 01:53:42,511
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if you wanna do this, don't let me stop you.

1706
01:53:43,813 --> 01:53:46,179
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Better start with Vallejo, Jack Mulanax.

1707
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:49,145
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand what you're trying to do...

1708
01:53:49,319 --> 01:53:51,549
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but this is an open police investigation.

1709
01:53:51,721 --> 01:53:53,882
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a friend of Dave Toschi's.

1710
01:53:54,057 --> 01:53:57,083
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he said that you might be able to help.

1711
01:53:57,594 --> 01:54:01,155
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, the case is dead. Zodiac's long gone.

1712
01:54:01,331 --> 01:54:03,561
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's yesterday's news, right?

1713
01:54:04,501 --> 01:54:06,298
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what they say.

1714
01:54:07,103 --> 01:54:09,037
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what's the harm?

1715
01:54:09,205 --> 01:54:10,729
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No pens, no paper.

1716
01:54:10,907 --> 01:54:13,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything that's relevant, you better remember in your head.

1717
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:15,241
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1718
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:19,248
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Okay, here we go.\n-Which one?

1719
01:54:19,416 --> 01:54:23,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All of them. There's more in the next room. They're all marked with these numbers.

1720
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:26,514
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-243-146\n-"243-146."\n-You don't smoke, do you?

1721
01:54:26,823 --> 01:54:29,849
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once. In high school.

1722
01:54:32,362 --> 01:54:33,852
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me see this.

1723
01:54:34,664 --> 01:54:36,564
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1724
01:54:37,167 --> 01:54:38,327


1725
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:58,587


1726
01:55:00,190 --> 01:55:02,249


1727
01:55:04,027 --> 01:55:05,688
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, you really creeped us out.

1728
01:55:11,868 --> 01:55:13,529
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Nine millimeter."

1729
01:55:15,672 --> 01:55:18,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Said nothing and began firing."

1730
01:55:23,113 --> 01:55:24,307


1731
01:55:25,882 --> 01:55:26,871


1732
01:55:27,050 --> 01:55:30,542


1733
01:55:33,857 --> 01:55:37,725
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Darlene's sister, Linda. It was all just deep breathing. George."

1734
01:55:39,062 --> 01:55:41,257
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"It was a strange man. George."

1735
01:55:43,133 --> 01:55:46,296
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you so much.

1736
01:55:46,469 --> 01:55:49,165
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, briefcase. Thanks.

1737
01:55:51,374 --> 01:55:53,638
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hey, Jack.\n-Hey, Bawart.

1738
01:55:53,810 --> 01:55:55,505
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who's that?\n-That's Graysmith.

1739
01:55:55,678 --> 01:55:59,079
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some cartoonist. Thinks he's gonna solve the Zodiac.

1740
01:56:01,084 --> 01:56:02,176
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, good for him.

1741
01:56:02,485 --> 01:56:05,113
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Traffic troubles won't be affecting very many commuters.

1742
01:56:05,288 --> 01:56:08,189
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Highway 37, blocked between Navarro and vallejo.

1743
01:56:08,358 --> 01:56:11,623
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A gasoline tanker truck overturned tonight....

1744
01:56:13,029 --> 01:56:15,054


1745
01:56:15,231 --> 01:56:16,493


1746
01:56:20,837 --> 01:56:22,498


1747
01:56:22,672 --> 01:56:24,503


1748
01:56:24,674 --> 01:56:26,335


1749
01:56:32,715 --> 01:56:35,013
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Thank you for meeting me.\n-No. We're not meeting.

1750
01:56:35,185 --> 01:56:37,483
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're just two guys sitting on the same bench.

1751
01:56:37,654 --> 01:56:40,248
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got five minutes. I've gotta get back to the Hall.

1752
01:56:40,423 --> 01:56:43,551
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As far as you know, did anyone ever get in touch with Mageau...

1753
01:56:43,726 --> 01:56:46,388
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...during your investigation and show him suspect photos?

1754
01:56:46,563 --> 01:56:47,552
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

1755
01:56:47,730 --> 01:56:50,665
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's the only surviving victim who saw Zodiac without a mask.

1756
01:56:50,834 --> 01:56:53,268
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, why are you asking me? That's Vallejo's case.

1757
01:56:53,436 --> 01:56:55,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paul Stine is mine. You've got four minutes now.

1758
01:56:56,039 --> 01:56:58,507
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, Darlene Ferrin was being followed.

1759
01:56:58,675 --> 01:57:01,109
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mulanax says they found this guy, a George Waters?

1760
01:57:01,277 --> 01:57:04,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He also said a lot of admirers would come to the restaurant where she worked.

1761
01:57:05,114 --> 01:57:06,775
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-She was popular.\n-Very.

1762
01:57:06,950 --> 01:57:09,942
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, so she and her husband, they move into their new house.

1763
01:57:10,119 --> 01:57:12,314
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And one night, they throw this painting party.

1764
01:57:12,489 --> 01:57:15,515
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What's a painting party?\n-A party where people help you paint.

1765
01:57:15,692 --> 01:57:18,217
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sounds like a terrible party.\n-Well, supposedly...

1766
01:57:18,394 --> 01:57:20,589
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...somebody who's not Waters shows up.

1767
01:57:20,763 --> 01:57:22,424
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Darlene is terrified of him.

1768
01:57:22,599 --> 01:57:24,533
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you think that Darlene knew Zodiac?

1769
01:57:24,701 --> 01:57:28,865
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if Zodiac knew Darlene, then maybe Mageau knows Zodiac.

1770
01:57:29,038 --> 01:57:30,733
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe. But Mageau's gone.

1771
01:57:30,907 --> 01:57:34,274
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you wanna connect Darlene to Zodiac, you'll have to find another way.

1772
01:57:34,444 --> 01:57:37,345
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have another way. Phone calls the night of Darlene's murder.

1773
01:57:37,514 --> 01:57:40,642
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah, Zodiac called the police.\n-No, there were four other calls.

1774
01:57:40,817 --> 01:57:44,184
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two to Darlene's house, Darlene's brother-in-law and father-in-law.

1775
01:57:44,354 --> 01:57:47,289
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just heavy breathing. They started around 1:30 a.m.

1776
01:57:47,457 --> 01:57:51,018
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this was before anyone in the family knew that Darlene had been shot.

1777
01:57:51,194 --> 01:57:53,253
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-This was in the Vallejo files?\n-Yeah.

1778
01:57:53,429 --> 01:57:55,556
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Goddamn it.\n-It's more than just coincidence.

1779
01:57:55,732 --> 01:57:59,395
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody doesn't just randomly prank phone call a victim's entire family...

1780
01:57:59,569 --> 01:58:01,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...90 minutes after they were shot.

1781
01:58:01,571 --> 01:58:05,098
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So either Zodiac shoots a random couple, then he recognizes Darlene....

1782
01:58:05,275 --> 01:58:07,209
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or Darlene was shot on purpose.

1783
01:58:07,377 --> 01:58:11,108
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Either way, Zodiac had to have known Darlene.

1784
01:58:12,348 --> 01:58:14,646
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's good, Robert.

1785
01:58:14,817 --> 01:58:17,547
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I can't find Mageau, maybe I can find Darlene's sister.

1786
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:19,915
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe she can tell me who this mystery man is.

1787
01:58:20,089 --> 01:58:23,252
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try that. I've got to go. She's very cute.

1788
01:58:26,696 --> 01:58:30,996
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, it's interesting that you should mention Zodiac calling people at home.

1789
01:58:31,167 --> 01:58:34,159
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He did that in San Francisco once.\n-What? Who did he call?

1790
01:58:34,337 --> 01:58:37,864
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't tell you. That's privileged information.

1791
01:58:38,708 --> 01:58:40,903
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But maybe Melvin Belli could.

1792
01:58:43,846 --> 01:58:47,976
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Melvin Belli. How do I get to Melvin Belli?

1793
01:58:48,585 --> 01:58:51,076
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He should be along soon.\n-Oh, that's all right.

1794
01:58:51,254 --> 01:58:55,623
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I've really only been waiting two hours....\n-He's usually not this late.

1795
01:58:55,792 --> 01:58:59,023
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, cookies. Thank you. These look great.

1796
01:58:59,228 --> 01:59:01,093
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are here on business?

1797
01:59:01,264 --> 01:59:03,289
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm writing a book about the Zodiac.

1798
01:59:03,466 --> 01:59:06,026
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember that. I spoke to him.

1799
01:59:06,202 --> 01:59:10,866
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You mean to Mr. Belli about the case?\n-No, to the Zodiac when he called.

1800
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:14,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said he had to kill because it was his birthday.

1801
01:59:14,277 --> 01:59:17,337
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said it.... Wait, he said it was his birthday?

1802
01:59:17,513 --> 01:59:20,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. You want something to drink?

1803
01:59:21,751 --> 01:59:23,446
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When was this?

1804
01:59:24,120 --> 01:59:26,418
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So many years ago.

1805
01:59:26,956 --> 01:59:31,052
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Belli was away for Christmas. Gone for a week.

1806
01:59:31,227 --> 01:59:33,695
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Zodiac called, wanting to talk to him.

1807
01:59:33,863 --> 01:59:35,194
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said, "He is not here."

1808
01:59:35,365 --> 01:59:37,959
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said, "I have to kill. Today is my birthday."

1809
01:59:38,134 --> 01:59:40,159
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then he hangs up.

1810
01:59:40,336 --> 01:59:41,894
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then the letter arrived.

1811
01:59:42,071 --> 01:59:46,201
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So the call came before the letter of December 20th.

1812
01:59:46,376 --> 01:59:48,173
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Belli was gone for a week?

1813
01:59:48,344 --> 01:59:52,007
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He came back on Christmas. Not a good day to work.

1814
01:59:52,181 --> 01:59:53,808
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So he left on the 18th.

1815
01:59:55,284 --> 01:59:58,151
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Is that helpful?\n-She said it was his birthday.

1816
01:59:58,321 --> 02:00:00,915
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you have to confirm that, now wouldn't you?

1817
02:00:01,090 --> 02:00:03,558
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How? How?

1818
02:00:03,726 --> 02:00:06,661
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I never spoke to her, but maybe my partner did.

1819
02:00:06,829 --> 02:00:09,821
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How do I get ahold of him?\n-You don't. Bill wanted out of this.

1820
02:00:09,999 --> 02:00:12,092
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As far as I'm concerned, he should stay out.

1821
02:00:12,268 --> 02:00:13,394
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do I confirm it?

1822
02:00:13,569 --> 02:00:16,197
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if my partner did talk to someone from Justice...

1823
02:00:16,372 --> 02:00:19,864
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...they would've had to put that in a report. That's standard procedure.

1824
02:00:20,343 --> 02:00:22,311
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Okay.\n-Mel Nicolai.

1825
02:00:22,478 --> 02:00:24,708
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Thank you.\n-Goodbye.

1826
02:00:24,881 --> 02:00:27,179
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I just need to confirm a date.\n-Mr. Graysmith.

1827
02:00:27,350 --> 02:00:30,376
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've narrowed it down between the 18th and the 20th of December...

1828
02:00:30,553 --> 02:00:33,886
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I'll play. Let's say this phone call did take place.

1829
02:00:34,057 --> 02:00:38,153
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's say it really was Zodiac. Why would he volunteer the day he was born?

1830
02:00:38,327 --> 02:00:40,158
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Plus, nobody died on December 18th...

1831
02:00:40,329 --> 02:00:43,787
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...like nobody died over the weekend he was gonna kill a dozen people...

1832
02:00:43,966 --> 02:00:45,957
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or when he was gonna shoot school kids.

1833
02:00:46,135 --> 02:00:49,002
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He's a liar, Mr. Graysmith.\n-What if he made a mistake?

1834
02:00:49,305 --> 02:00:53,605
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if he wasn't lying, if it was him? He didn't expect a nice person to pick up.

1835
02:00:53,776 --> 02:00:55,038
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if, what if, what if?

1836
02:00:55,211 --> 02:00:58,544
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, off the record, Bill Armstrong checked this out.

1837
02:00:58,715 --> 02:01:01,183
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We took this very seriously.

1838
02:01:01,350 --> 02:01:04,444
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}None of the suspects had the same birthday as this phantom caller.

1839
02:01:04,620 --> 02:01:06,952
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bill Armstrong.

1840
02:01:12,295 --> 02:01:16,391
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I give you a piece of advice? You're looking in the wrong place.

1841
02:01:16,566 --> 02:01:19,433
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Handwriting, fingerprints, that's what this thing's about.

1842
02:01:19,602 --> 02:01:20,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stick to the evidence.

1843
02:01:21,904 --> 02:01:23,337
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

1844
02:01:31,247 --> 02:01:33,477
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. How was your day?

1845
02:01:33,649 --> 02:01:35,173
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Long.

1846
02:01:39,689 --> 02:01:40,917
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's Sherwood Morrill?

1847
02:01:41,090 --> 02:01:43,752
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a handwriting expert in Sacramento.

1848
02:01:43,926 --> 02:01:47,293
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He called. He said he could meet you tomorrow morning at 7.

1849
02:01:47,463 --> 02:01:48,794
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, great.

1850
02:01:48,965 --> 02:01:50,227
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you're taking off work?

1851
02:01:50,399 --> 02:01:52,492
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just an hour.

1852
02:01:53,336 --> 02:01:54,667
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sacramento's two hours away.

1853
02:01:56,773 --> 02:01:58,934
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Really?\n-Yes.

1854
02:01:59,108 --> 02:02:00,598
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's this?

1855
02:02:00,777 --> 02:02:03,211
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that's the... That article.

1856
02:02:03,379 --> 02:02:06,815
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Robert Graysmith has quietly been shopping his book about the Zodiac."

1857
02:02:06,983 --> 02:02:08,143
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1858
02:02:08,317 --> 02:02:12,515
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It talks all about you researching Zodiac.\n-Well, that's what the article's about.

1859
02:02:12,688 --> 02:02:14,679
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not sure we want people to know that.

1860
02:02:14,857 --> 02:02:16,017
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, are you embarrassed?

1861
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:19,059
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robert, what's the one thing we know about Zodiac?

1862
02:02:20,163 --> 02:02:21,687
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He reads the Chronicle?

1863
02:02:21,864 --> 02:02:24,662
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but he's never gonna read Herb Caen.

1864
02:02:28,571 --> 02:02:30,766
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hello.\n-Mr. Graysmith?

1865
02:02:30,940 --> 02:02:33,431
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Robert Graysmith mentioned in the paper today?

1866
02:02:33,609 --> 02:02:34,769
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah?

1867
02:02:34,944 --> 02:02:37,777
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can tell you who the Zodiac is.

1868
02:02:40,616 --> 02:02:43,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who is this?\n-The Zodiac Killer is obsessed with movies.

1869
02:02:43,886 --> 02:02:46,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He recorded his murders on film.

1870
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:49,819
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried to tell the police, but they wouldn't follow through on it.

1871
02:02:49,992 --> 02:02:53,393
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a man you need to find. His name is Bob vaughn.

1872
02:02:53,563 --> 02:02:55,861
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Pen, pen.\n-V-A-U-G-H-N.

1873
02:02:56,032 --> 02:02:57,863
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a friend of the Zodiac's.

1874
02:02:58,034 --> 02:03:00,366
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. vaughn does not know his friend is a killer...

1875
02:03:00,536 --> 02:03:02,868
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and he's storing some film canisters for him.

1876
02:03:03,039 --> 02:03:04,939
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In these canisters is the evidence.

1877
02:03:05,107 --> 02:03:08,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, yeah, friend? Who's his friend?

1878
02:03:08,444 --> 02:03:11,641
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You have quite enough to get started.\n-Oh, please.

1879
02:03:11,814 --> 02:03:16,114
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Zodiac's name is Rick Marshall.

1880
02:03:18,821 --> 02:03:21,016
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your toast is burning.

1881
02:03:21,991 --> 02:03:27,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We choose at some point in our lives how to physically construct each letter.

1882
02:03:27,697 --> 02:03:29,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once we lock that into our brains...

1883
02:03:29,966 --> 02:03:32,332
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...our handwriting may change over the years...

1884
02:03:32,501 --> 02:03:35,868
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but the moves themselves remain unaltered. Understand?

1885
02:03:36,038 --> 02:03:37,505
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

1886
02:03:38,207 --> 02:03:40,767
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Except Zodiac's doesn't.

1887
02:03:41,978 --> 02:03:44,344
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Specifically with his K.

1888
02:03:45,014 --> 02:03:47,744
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In his first letters, he executed the K with two strokes.

1889
02:03:47,917 --> 02:03:50,715
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Later letters, he did them with three.\n-Why?

1890
02:03:50,887 --> 02:03:53,754
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't know. Excuse me, I gotta spray this.

1891
02:03:53,923 --> 02:03:56,983
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many suspects were cleared through handwriting?

1892
02:03:57,159 --> 02:04:02,062
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All of them. Also the print in the cab. No match was ever found.

1893
02:04:02,231 --> 02:04:06,258
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there any way that someone could beat a handwriting test?

1894
02:04:06,435 --> 02:04:11,168
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Whoever the Zodiac is, he's not someone I cleared.

1895
02:04:11,774 --> 02:04:15,232
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}About a month ago, a man showed up on my doorstep very distraught.

1896
02:04:15,511 --> 02:04:18,002
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Name was Wallace Penny.

1897
02:04:18,180 --> 02:04:22,549
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said he knew who the Zodiac was. Gave me a name.

1898
02:04:22,718 --> 02:04:25,414
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Rick, Rick somebody.\n-Rick Marshall?

1899
02:04:26,856 --> 02:04:29,882
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah.\n-The man you talked to called me too.

1900
02:04:30,059 --> 02:04:34,655
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After he left, then I checked my files. I never cleared a Rick Marshall.

1901
02:04:41,804 --> 02:04:43,294
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

1902
02:04:48,077 --> 02:04:49,908
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello. Who is this?

1903
02:04:59,789 --> 02:05:01,586
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a wrong number.

1904
02:05:07,964 --> 02:05:10,956
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does the name Rick Marshall mean anything to you?

1905
02:05:11,968 --> 02:05:15,165
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What are you after?\n-What do you got?

1906
02:05:15,338 --> 02:05:20,173
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hypothetically, you just named my favorite suspect in the whole case.

1907
02:05:20,710 --> 02:05:24,544
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is off the record. Couple years back, I was trying to get Marshall's prints.

1908
02:05:24,714 --> 02:05:26,944
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I handed him a photo. He looks at it.

1909
02:05:27,116 --> 02:05:28,947
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's about to give it back and he says:

1910
02:05:29,118 --> 02:05:31,518
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"My goodness, I got fingerprints all over this."

1911
02:05:31,687 --> 02:05:34,019
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he wipes them off.

1912
02:05:34,190 --> 02:05:36,055
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why didn't you test him for handwriting?

1913
02:05:36,225 --> 02:05:38,489
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because when they finally did run his prints...

1914
02:05:38,661 --> 02:05:41,061
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...they cleared him against the one in Stine's cab.

1915
02:05:41,230 --> 02:05:43,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-So it's not him.\n-Maybe yes, maybe no.

1916
02:05:43,299 --> 02:05:45,324
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. What do you mean?

1917
02:05:45,501 --> 02:05:47,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Zodiac left gloves behind at the scene.

1918
02:05:47,737 --> 02:05:49,728
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he had the foresight to bring gloves...

1919
02:05:49,905 --> 02:05:52,396
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...how's he gonna accidentally leave a print behind?

1920
02:05:52,575 --> 02:05:54,167
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it was in the victim's blood.

1921
02:05:54,343 --> 02:05:58,336
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could have been one of the bystanders or a cop just reaches out...false print.

1922
02:05:58,514 --> 02:06:00,607
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that print disqualified 2500 suspects.

1923
02:06:00,783 --> 02:06:03,547
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Which is why we used handwriting.\n-But not for Marshall.

1924
02:06:03,719 --> 02:06:06,552
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}S.F.P.D. saw a handwritten sign in the window of his house...

1925
02:06:06,722 --> 02:06:09,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...decided it looked nothing like the Z letters, so they moved on.

1926
02:06:10,026 --> 02:06:12,517
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do they know that Rick Marshall wrote the sign?

1927
02:06:12,695 --> 02:06:14,925
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My thoughts exactly.

1928
02:06:15,097 --> 02:06:17,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rick Marshall was a Navy man.

1929
02:06:17,366 --> 02:06:21,302
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He received code training. He was also a projectionist at a silent-film theater.

1930
02:06:21,470 --> 02:06:23,631
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do I get copies of Marshall's handwriting?

1931
02:06:23,806 --> 02:06:27,401
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three ways. One, get a warrant, which you can't.

1932
02:06:27,576 --> 02:06:30,374
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Two, get him to volunteer which he won't.\n-Yeah, and three?

1933
02:06:31,814 --> 02:06:33,577
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get creative.

1934
02:06:33,749 --> 02:06:36,479
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what to tell you. You get it, I'll analyze it.

1935
02:06:36,652 --> 02:06:40,247
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Beyond that, you're on your own.\n-What about the guy who saw you?

1936
02:06:40,423 --> 02:06:41,754
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The one who called me?

1937
02:06:41,924 --> 02:06:44,415
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean Wallace Penny?

1938
02:06:44,593 --> 02:06:46,925
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Did he leave a number?

1939
02:06:55,805 --> 02:06:59,172
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hello?\n-Hi, this is Robert Graysmith.

1940
02:06:59,341 --> 02:07:02,435
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How did you find me?\n-I need a sample of Marshall's writing.

1941
02:07:02,611 --> 02:07:03,942
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you. vaughn is who...

1942
02:07:04,113 --> 02:07:06,775
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Penny, if Rick Marshall is the Zodiac...

1943
02:07:06,949 --> 02:07:09,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I need a sample of his handwriting to confirm it.

1944
02:07:09,618 --> 02:07:11,745
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you help me or not?

1945
02:07:12,955 --> 02:07:17,449
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rick used to draw movie posters for the theater vaughn worked at.

1946
02:07:17,693 --> 02:07:19,752
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'll send one down.\n-Thank you.

1947
02:07:29,638 --> 02:07:30,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll need more samples.

1948
02:07:30,906 --> 02:07:33,374
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah, but is it...?\n-It's as close as I've ever seen.

1949
02:07:33,542 --> 02:07:37,171
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tread lightly here. We're talking about implicating this man as the Zodiac.

1950
02:07:37,346 --> 02:07:40,315
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can get more. I'll just find Vaughn and I'll track down Linda.

1951
02:07:40,483 --> 02:07:43,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, Linda is Darlene's sister. I've been to the DMV...

1952
02:07:44,019 --> 02:07:48,217
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I talked to her parents, but still, nobody knows where to find her.

1953
02:07:48,390 --> 02:07:52,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Graysmith, most of the writing matches the exemplar.

1954
02:07:53,028 --> 02:07:56,054
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Though it's the part that doesn't match that scares me the most.

1955
02:07:56,232 --> 02:07:58,325
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What do you mean?\n-Well, on the poster...

1956
02:07:58,501 --> 02:08:01,834
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the one letter that absolutely, positively does not match...

1957
02:08:02,004 --> 02:08:03,835
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is the letter K.

1958
02:08:05,508 --> 02:08:08,739
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wouldn't happen to have any Animal Crackers in there, would you?

1959
02:08:09,578 --> 02:08:13,378
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unit 5, Toschi needs to call in on a landline.

1960
02:08:21,157 --> 02:08:24,820


1961
02:08:24,994 --> 02:08:27,258
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Dispatch.\n-Hey. Dave Toschi.

1962
02:08:27,429 --> 02:08:29,192
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll connect you.

1963
02:08:29,765 --> 02:08:31,357
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Dave?\n-Yeah. What's up?

1964
02:08:31,534 --> 02:08:33,434
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jennings here from the Chronicle.

1965
02:08:33,602 --> 02:08:35,763
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It came in this morning. You need to see it.

1966
02:08:35,938 --> 02:08:36,927
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See what?

1967
02:08:37,106 --> 02:08:39,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The new Zodiac letter. And it mentions you.

1968
02:08:39,875 --> 02:08:41,843
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay.

1969
02:08:43,112 --> 02:08:47,378
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit. All right, come on. Hall of Justice.

1970
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:51,575
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now. Come on, come on, come on.

1971
02:08:57,059 --> 02:08:58,287
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave.

1972
02:08:58,894 --> 02:09:00,919
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have it with you?

1973
02:09:04,466 --> 02:09:06,798
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"This is the Zodiac speaking. I'm back with you.

1974
02:09:06,969 --> 02:09:09,904
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell Herb Caen I am here, I have always been here.

1975
02:09:10,072 --> 02:09:12,905
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That city pig Toschi is good, but I am smarter and better.

1976
02:09:13,075 --> 02:09:16,067
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He will get tired, then leave me alone.

1977
02:09:16,245 --> 02:09:18,907
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm waiting for a good movie about me. Who will play me?

1978
02:09:19,081 --> 02:09:21,549
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm now in control of all things."

1979
02:09:21,717 --> 02:09:24,277
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These guys are from Internal Affairs.

1980
02:09:26,088 --> 02:09:27,953
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to talk.

1981
02:09:28,123 --> 02:09:29,454
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good evening. Our top story:

1982
02:09:29,625 --> 02:09:32,059
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The San Francisco Police Department has confirmed...

1983
02:09:32,228 --> 02:09:36,289
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that the man who calls himself Zodiac and terrorized the Bay Area...

1984
02:09:36,465 --> 02:09:39,127
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...has broken his silence of 51 months.

1985
02:09:39,301 --> 02:09:41,861
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In a letter claiming, "I am back with you"...

1986
02:09:42,037 --> 02:09:45,768
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the Zodiac makes no overt threats against the citizenry...

1987
02:09:45,941 --> 02:09:48,603
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and muses that his life would make the best movie yet.

1988
02:09:48,777 --> 02:09:50,836
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These carrots are perfect.

1989
02:09:51,447 --> 02:09:53,278
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Just go.\n-This message also mentions...

1990
02:09:53,449 --> 02:09:55,849
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen...

1991
02:09:56,018 --> 02:09:58,851
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and the department's own David Toschi by name.

1992
02:09:59,021 --> 02:10:00,079
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May I be excused?

1993
02:10:00,256 --> 02:10:02,986
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to come back and finish what's on that plate.

1994
02:10:03,158 --> 02:10:05,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our team's coverage on the cipher slayer's return...

1995
02:10:05,995 --> 02:10:08,463
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...begins as Alan Freeman has more.

1996
02:10:08,631 --> 02:10:11,896
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Eric. Chronicle columnist Armistead Maupin said...

1997
02:10:12,067 --> 02:10:14,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that he thinks not only is this new letter a forgery...

1998
02:10:15,070 --> 02:10:19,234
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but it was written by the very man trusted to hunt down this killer...

1999
02:10:19,408 --> 02:10:22,844
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...David Toschi. Maupin, a very well-respected author...

2000
02:10:23,012 --> 02:10:27,142
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...has gone on record saying that he believes Toschi wrote the letter...

2001
02:10:27,316 --> 02:10:29,216
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to drum up publicity for himself.

2002
02:10:29,385 --> 02:10:32,479
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maupin used David as a character in his column.

2003
02:10:32,655 --> 02:10:35,988
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}David got a kick out of it and wrote a couple of anonymous letters...

2004
02:10:36,158 --> 02:10:38,319
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...asking for the character to be brought back.

2005
02:10:38,494 --> 02:10:41,657
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was like writing fan mail to himself. That's all.

2006
02:10:41,830 --> 02:10:43,991
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But David did not write that letter.

2007
02:10:44,166 --> 02:10:47,158
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm sure that he didn't. I'm sure this will all blow over.

2008
02:10:47,336 --> 02:10:48,496
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Blow over"?

2009
02:10:48,671 --> 02:10:50,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They kicked him out of Homicide.

2010
02:10:50,906 --> 02:10:54,171
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They made him give his handwriting like some common criminal.

2011
02:10:54,343 --> 02:10:57,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-May I talk to him?\n-No.

2012
02:10:57,880 --> 02:11:01,213
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you just ask him if he ever investigated a man named Rick Marshall?

2013
02:11:01,383 --> 02:11:03,374
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that all you can think about?

2014
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:07,147
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Graysmith, Maupin works at your paper. We trust...

2015
02:11:12,828 --> 02:11:16,559
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-This girl, she wants music lessons?\n-Dave. Dave.

2016
02:11:17,866 --> 02:11:20,198
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Okay, see you later.\n-I'll catch up to you.

2017
02:11:20,369 --> 02:11:22,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stop calling my house. Do you understand me?

2018
02:11:22,705 --> 02:11:24,332
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need your help to find Linda.

2019
02:11:24,506 --> 02:11:27,202
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Jesus.\n-Look, two seconds.

2020
02:11:28,544 --> 02:11:30,978
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, we've been running handwriting samples.

2021
02:11:31,146 --> 02:11:33,239
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who's we?\n-Sherwood and I.

2022
02:11:33,415 --> 02:11:36,646
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sherwood? Sherwood who was fired from Questioned Documents?

2023
02:11:36,819 --> 02:11:39,413
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sherwood who drinks like Paul Avery?\n-He retired.

2024
02:11:39,588 --> 02:11:41,078
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that what he told you?

2025
02:11:41,256 --> 02:11:45,215
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What, are you saying he's wrong?\n-I'm saying stop calling my house.

2026
02:11:45,961 --> 02:11:47,792
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We ran them on Marshall.\n-No, Robert.

2027
02:11:47,963 --> 02:11:51,592
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No, I know you don't think it's him.\n-I am not having this conversation.

2028
02:11:51,767 --> 02:11:54,031
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I can't talk to Mageau or Linda, so I'm...

2029
02:11:54,203 --> 02:11:55,727
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Robert, stop it.\n-What? What?

2030
02:11:55,904 --> 02:11:59,567
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Rick Marshalls of this world will suck you dry. They're blind alleys.

2031
02:11:59,742 --> 02:12:02,734
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he said he wasn't gonna announce his murders anymore, Dave.

2032
02:12:02,911 --> 02:12:05,778
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know what the chances of us arresting someone are now?

2033
02:12:05,948 --> 02:12:09,941
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too much time has gone by, okay? Too much of the evidence is lost.

2034
02:12:10,119 --> 02:12:13,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People get old, Robert. They forget.

2035
02:12:13,422 --> 02:12:17,449
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I have been a cop for 25 years. Murder police for 12.

2036
02:12:17,626 --> 02:12:19,423
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What do you do?\n-You know what I do.

2037
02:12:19,595 --> 02:12:22,189
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You're a cartoonist.\n-So, what are you saying?

2038
02:12:22,364 --> 02:12:26,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am saying Zodiac was my job. It is not yours.

2039
02:12:28,670 --> 02:12:31,104
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He's still out there.\n-No, I am through with this.

2040
02:12:31,273 --> 02:12:33,332
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am through with you.

2041
02:12:39,448 --> 02:12:42,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about September 26, 1970?

2042
02:12:42,284 --> 02:12:46,277
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Okay, which one was that?\n-"Lake Tahoe Nurse Goes Missing."

2043
02:12:48,524 --> 02:12:51,925
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-One day before the vernal equinox. Dad?\n-Yeah. Mark that.

2044
02:12:52,094 --> 02:12:55,427
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, got another one. June 19th, 1971.

2045
02:12:55,597 --> 02:12:58,691
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's gotta be near the summer solstice.

2046
02:13:00,836 --> 02:13:05,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, guys. Don't tell Mom about our special project, okay?

2047
02:13:05,974 --> 02:13:09,341
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How come you and Mom don't sleep in the same bed anymore?

2048
02:13:13,515 --> 02:13:16,143
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hello?\n-Mr. Graysmith, Ken Narlow from Napa.

2049
02:13:16,318 --> 02:13:20,311
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Captain Narlow. Thank you for calling me back.

2050
02:13:20,489 --> 02:13:22,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. How can I help?

2051
02:13:22,324 --> 02:13:25,191
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I called because we've been cross-referencing lunar cycles...

2052
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:26,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...with the Zodiac's timeline.

2053
02:13:27,029 --> 02:13:30,556
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More often than not, each cycle since '69 corresponds with an attack...

2054
02:13:30,732 --> 02:13:33,997
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or with one of the letters or an unsolved homicide.

2055
02:13:34,169 --> 02:13:37,036
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who's working with you on this?\n-Some colleagues.

2056
02:13:37,206 --> 02:13:38,434
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad?

2057
02:13:39,374 --> 02:13:41,808
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Ken, can you hold on one second?\n-Dad?

2058
02:13:42,244 --> 02:13:44,235
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What is it?\n-What's this?

2059
02:13:48,016 --> 02:13:51,213
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the decade since the Zodiac's last cipher was received...

2060
02:13:51,386 --> 02:13:54,617
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...every federal agency has taken a crack at decoding it.

2061
02:13:54,790 --> 02:13:56,018


2062
02:13:56,191 --> 02:14:00,093
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But today, where those agencies had failed, a cartoonist has succeeded.

2063
02:14:00,262 --> 02:14:02,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you do it?

2064
02:14:02,731 --> 02:14:05,825
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a lot of books from the library...

2065
02:14:06,001 --> 02:14:09,664
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I love puzzles, so I just....

2066
02:14:09,838 --> 02:14:12,033
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. The fucking library.

2067
02:14:12,207 --> 02:14:15,199
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe you can accomplish anything that you put your mind...

2068
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:21,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a J? Okay. Honor Camp?

2069
02:14:22,451 --> 02:14:24,351
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you so much.

2070
02:14:25,888 --> 02:14:28,618
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, we found Linda. She's in jail. lsn't that great?

2071
02:14:28,790 --> 02:14:30,781
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why'd you do it?\n-She'll identify Rick...

2072
02:14:30,959 --> 02:14:34,292
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What are you talking about?\n-You went on TV.

2073
02:14:34,463 --> 02:14:37,728
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You put yourself out there for him to see.\n-You're being paranoid.

2074
02:14:37,900 --> 02:14:40,892
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then who's been calling our house in the middle of the night?

2075
02:14:41,069 --> 02:14:43,196
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody, I...

2076
02:14:43,972 --> 02:14:47,169
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What's it gonna take for you to be done?\n-I can't talk about this.

2077
02:14:47,342 --> 02:14:48,673
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to go see Bob Vaughn.

2078
02:14:48,844 --> 02:14:51,938
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that's too bad, because we're gonna talk about this.

2079
02:14:52,114 --> 02:14:56,278
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When is it gonna be finished? When you catch him, when you arrest him?

2080
02:14:56,451 --> 02:14:58,919
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Be serious.\n-I am serious.

2081
02:15:00,889 --> 02:15:05,223
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to know who he is.

2082
02:15:05,827 --> 02:15:09,456
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to stand there. I need to look him in the eye...

2083
02:15:09,631 --> 02:15:12,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I need to know that it's him.

2084
02:15:13,235 --> 02:15:15,601
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that more important than your family's safety?

2085
02:15:15,771 --> 02:15:17,898
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course not.

2086
02:15:19,274 --> 02:15:22,243
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why? Why do you need to do this?

2087
02:15:23,278 --> 02:15:24,711
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

2088
02:15:26,548 --> 02:15:28,175
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because nobody else will.

2089
02:15:28,350 --> 02:15:29,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not good enough.

2090
02:15:30,652 --> 02:15:32,142
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you done? Can I go?

2091
02:15:47,936 --> 02:15:49,961
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Mr. Vaughn?\n-Mr. Graysmith?

2092
02:15:50,138 --> 02:15:52,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yes.\n-Hi. You needed to speak to me?

2093
02:15:52,641 --> 02:15:54,871
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. There's a coffee shop right on the corner.

2094
02:15:55,043 --> 02:15:58,137
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why don't we just go to my home?\n-Oh, I don't wanna put you out.

2095
02:15:58,313 --> 02:16:01,043
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's no trouble at all. Where are you parked?

2096
02:16:01,216 --> 02:16:02,308
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just right there.

2097
02:16:02,484 --> 02:16:04,145
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can follow me?

2098
02:16:05,654 --> 02:16:06,882
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

2099
02:16:24,706 --> 02:16:26,367
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch your step.

2100
02:16:30,912 --> 02:16:34,177
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Very nice house.\n-Oh, thank you.

2101
02:16:34,349 --> 02:16:36,078
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's very rustic.

2102
02:16:36,251 --> 02:16:39,186
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Can I take your jacket?\n-No, thank you, I'm fine.

2103
02:16:39,354 --> 02:16:42,255
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. This way, please.

2104
02:16:44,259 --> 02:16:45,954
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Have a seat.\n-Thank you.

2105
02:16:46,128 --> 02:16:48,528
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How about some tea?\n-Oh, no, I'm all right.

2106
02:16:48,697 --> 02:16:50,961
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You sure?\n-Yes.

2107
02:16:51,133 --> 02:16:54,762
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted to ask you about a film that the Avenue may have played...

2108
02:16:54,936 --> 02:16:59,066
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...while you were the organist there, The Most Dangerous Game?

2109
02:16:59,241 --> 02:17:02,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a classic. RKO. 1932.

2110
02:17:02,711 --> 02:17:07,239
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fay Wray, Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks. We've run that picture many times.

2111
02:17:07,416 --> 02:17:09,111
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In '68, '69?

2112
02:17:10,719 --> 02:17:12,687
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd have to check my records. Why?

2113
02:17:12,854 --> 02:17:14,754
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you remember the Zodiac?

2114
02:17:17,225 --> 02:17:19,489
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it?

2115
02:17:19,661 --> 02:17:23,392
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He was a projectionist there, right?\n-For a time, yes.

2116
02:17:23,565 --> 02:17:27,296
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I have no occasion to correspond with him these days.

2117
02:17:27,469 --> 02:17:29,733
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, well, there is a connection...

2118
02:17:29,905 --> 02:17:32,465
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...between one of the Zodiac attacks and that film.

2119
02:17:32,641 --> 02:17:34,404
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean the symbol?

2120
02:17:35,777 --> 02:17:37,472
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on.

2121
02:17:37,646 --> 02:17:42,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Zodiac symbol on film. It's on the countdown.

2122
02:17:45,487 --> 02:17:48,217
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's trimmed off each reel before it's shown...

2123
02:17:48,390 --> 02:17:50,415
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but it always arrives with it.

2124
02:17:50,592 --> 02:17:52,583
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right there.

2125
02:17:53,095 --> 02:17:56,895
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The first time I saw it in the papers, I thought about that.

2126
02:17:57,399 --> 02:17:58,491
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got a tip...

2127
02:17:58,667 --> 02:18:03,104
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that Rick left a film canister here that he told you never to open.

2128
02:18:03,271 --> 02:18:06,104
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tip about a mysterious film canister?

2129
02:18:07,109 --> 02:18:08,599
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it true?

2130
02:18:10,345 --> 02:18:11,573
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

2131
02:18:12,013 --> 02:18:14,481
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Did you open it?\n-No.

2132
02:18:14,649 --> 02:18:20,178
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-May I see it?\n-Rick took it back in 1972.

2133
02:18:20,789 --> 02:18:25,351
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This tip is how you got it in your head that Rick is the Zodiac?

2134
02:18:25,527 --> 02:18:27,119
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That and the poster.

2135
02:18:27,295 --> 02:18:29,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The poster?

2136
02:18:30,632 --> 02:18:32,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The poster that Rick drew.

2137
02:18:32,367 --> 02:18:35,359
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The handwriting is the closest that we have ever come to a match.

2138
02:18:35,537 --> 02:18:37,368
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rick didn't draw any posters.

2139
02:18:37,539 --> 02:18:39,006
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, he drew this one.

2140
02:18:39,174 --> 02:18:43,508
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters myself.

2141
02:18:43,678 --> 02:18:46,078
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my handwriting.

2142
02:18:54,055 --> 02:18:56,956
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't take any more of your time.

2143
02:18:57,125 --> 02:19:02,461
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't I just go and find out when we played that film?

2144
02:19:02,631 --> 02:19:03,996
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that's all right.

2145
02:19:04,166 --> 02:19:08,227
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not a problem. They're just down in the basement.

2146
02:19:09,337 --> 02:19:12,397
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not many people have basements in California.

2147
02:19:15,076 --> 02:19:16,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do.

2148
02:19:18,113 --> 02:19:20,411
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coming, Mr. Graysmith?

2149
02:19:31,626 --> 02:19:36,188
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The original studio one-sheets I always kept for myself.

2150
02:19:37,165 --> 02:19:40,191
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cheapo knockoffs like you brought today...

2151
02:19:40,368 --> 02:19:42,836
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I end up tossing into the back alley.

2152
02:19:57,219 --> 02:19:59,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'69.

2153
02:20:04,693 --> 02:20:05,785
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You live alone?

2154
02:20:05,961 --> 02:20:11,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69.

2155
02:20:12,067 --> 02:20:18,404
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So that would be about nine weeks before the first Zodiac letter, correct?

2156
02:20:21,409 --> 02:20:23,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

2157
02:20:26,882 --> 02:20:30,943
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think he saw the film in our theater and was inspired?

2158
02:20:37,259 --> 02:20:39,727
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure there's nobody else in the house?

2159
02:20:41,663 --> 02:20:43,893
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you like to go upstairs and check?

2160
02:20:45,133 --> 02:20:46,828
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

2161
02:20:49,271 --> 02:20:52,638
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. Thanks for everything.

2162
02:20:52,807 --> 02:20:54,502
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're welcome.

2163
02:21:15,597 --> 02:21:17,258
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's locked.

2164
02:21:27,776 --> 02:21:29,073
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

2165
02:21:32,147 --> 02:21:34,809
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, Mr. Graysmith.

2166
02:21:55,070 --> 02:21:59,769
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gotta be two killers. One has the map, the other one kills....

2167
02:22:05,747 --> 02:22:07,237
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys?

2168
02:22:26,334 --> 02:22:28,234


2169
02:22:36,311 --> 02:22:38,336


2170
02:22:40,582 --> 02:22:42,743
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got five minutes.

2171
02:22:50,492 --> 02:22:52,153
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Linda?

2172
02:22:52,694 --> 02:22:54,594
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, I'm Robert.

2173
02:22:58,366 --> 02:23:00,664
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you get my note?

2174
02:23:00,835 --> 02:23:02,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What's this about?\n-Zodiac.

2175
02:23:04,506 --> 02:23:06,235
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Figures.

2176
02:23:06,875 --> 02:23:09,366
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You got the look.\n-What look?

2177
02:23:09,978 --> 02:23:12,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't mean anything.

2178
02:23:13,214 --> 02:23:15,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me about this painting party.

2179
02:23:16,551 --> 02:23:19,611
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told the cops about that so long ago.

2180
02:23:22,690 --> 02:23:26,421
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Darlene always had a lot of boys around, even though she was married.

2181
02:23:26,594 --> 02:23:29,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this one guy was weird, though.

2182
02:23:29,464 --> 02:23:33,298
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He used to bring her presents from Tijuana and....

2183
02:23:33,468 --> 02:23:36,062
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know why she was friends with him.

2184
02:23:36,237 --> 02:23:38,467
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But she once told me he'd killed somebody.

2185
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:40,039
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

2186
02:23:40,208 --> 02:23:42,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I think maybe when he was in the service.

2187
02:23:42,710 --> 02:23:44,644
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Navy?\n-I think so.

2188
02:23:44,813 --> 02:23:46,804
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was he into movies? Was he a movie buff?

2189
02:23:46,981 --> 02:23:49,449
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can tell you that he was not into people.

2190
02:23:49,617 --> 02:23:52,677
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The party Darlene threw, people were supposed to just show up...

2191
02:23:52,854 --> 02:23:54,344
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and drink beer, help paint.

2192
02:23:54,522 --> 02:23:56,547
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this guy showed up in a suit...

2193
02:23:56,724 --> 02:23:59,557
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and just sat in a chair all by himself all night long.

2194
02:23:59,727 --> 02:24:01,285
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't talk to anyone.

2195
02:24:01,463 --> 02:24:05,229
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Darlene told me to stay away from him. She was scared of him.

2196
02:24:07,569 --> 02:24:09,764
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couple weeks later, she was dead.

2197
02:24:09,938 --> 02:24:12,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. Do you remember his name?

2198
02:24:13,475 --> 02:24:17,138
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, it was short, like a nickname. Like Stan.

2199
02:24:17,412 --> 02:24:20,381
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Rick?\n-No, I don't think so.

2200
02:24:20,548 --> 02:24:22,675
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Are you sure?\n-Yeah.

2201
02:24:22,851 --> 02:24:25,342
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can you be sure? It was long ago. Think hard.

2202
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:26,885
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am thinking hard.

2203
02:24:27,622 --> 02:24:29,749
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was Rick.

2204
02:24:29,924 --> 02:24:32,859
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No, it wasn't.\n-It was Rick. It was Rick Marshall.

2205
02:24:33,027 --> 02:24:35,393
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No.\n-Just say it.

2206
02:24:35,563 --> 02:24:38,396
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It wasn't Rick.

2207
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:51,171
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was Leigh.

2208
02:24:54,477 --> 02:24:57,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Leigh?\n-Yeah, Leigh.

2209
02:24:58,281 --> 02:24:59,612
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sounds right.

2210
02:25:04,354 --> 02:25:05,685
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Officer!

2211
02:25:05,856 --> 02:25:08,256
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I need you to let me in.\n-Is this an emergency?

2212
02:25:08,425 --> 02:25:10,017
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I just need to see one file.

2213
02:25:10,193 --> 02:25:13,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to come back tomorrow morning, 8 a.m., when we're open.

2214
02:25:13,563 --> 02:25:15,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sergeant! Sergeant Mulanax!

2215
02:25:15,365 --> 02:25:18,698
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sergeant, I just need to see one file! Just give me five minutes.

2216
02:25:18,869 --> 02:25:21,099
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know exactly where it is.

2217
02:25:22,272 --> 02:25:23,739
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please.

2218
02:25:36,786 --> 02:25:38,549
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I shouldn't be talking to you.

2219
02:25:38,722 --> 02:25:40,986
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You got five minutes.\n-Okay.

2220
02:25:42,792 --> 02:25:44,123
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here. Here.

2221
02:25:44,294 --> 02:25:47,889
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Linda states that some of Darlene's closest friends are Leigh...

2222
02:25:48,064 --> 02:25:51,033
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...who used to bring Darlene presents from Tijuana.

2223
02:25:51,201 --> 02:25:52,896
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-So what?\n-He knew her.

2224
02:25:53,069 --> 02:25:54,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Linda said Leigh. This is Leigh.

2225
02:25:54,905 --> 02:25:58,898
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. That's just one name in a file that contains hundreds. It's nothing.

2226
02:25:59,376 --> 02:26:02,311
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Dave Toschi...\n-Agrees with me.

2227
02:26:02,479 --> 02:26:05,471
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our investigation into this subject is over.

2228
02:26:08,285 --> 02:26:09,775
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

2229
02:26:18,728 --> 02:26:20,218
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello.

2230
02:26:35,011 --> 02:26:36,342
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's there?

2231
02:26:39,883 --> 02:26:42,545
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You didn't return my calls.\n-I've been kind of busy.

2232
02:26:43,486 --> 02:26:45,954
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I can see that.

2233
02:26:47,590 --> 02:26:49,057
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's the book coming?

2234
02:26:52,429 --> 02:26:54,863
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried to send you these.

2235
02:26:55,465 --> 02:26:57,228
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I called the Chron.

2236
02:26:57,400 --> 02:27:01,734
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm not a cartoonist anymore, so....

2237
02:27:01,905 --> 02:27:03,566
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I heard.

2238
02:27:08,178 --> 02:27:10,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When's the last time you ate something?

2239
02:27:13,350 --> 02:27:15,045
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing makes sense anymore.

2240
02:27:18,054 --> 02:27:19,544
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did it ever?

2241
02:27:19,723 --> 02:27:21,816
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it did.

2242
02:27:21,992 --> 02:27:24,358
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robert, it was just the date that didn't end.

2243
02:27:25,362 --> 02:27:27,023
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't mean that.

2244
02:27:28,365 --> 02:27:29,957
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A little.

2245
02:27:32,502 --> 02:27:34,265
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The kids miss you.

2246
02:27:34,437 --> 02:27:36,337
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't have them see me like this.

2247
02:27:36,506 --> 02:27:40,602
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neither can I. So do whatever you have to...

2248
02:27:41,244 --> 02:27:43,007
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but finish this.

2249
02:27:54,991 --> 02:27:56,481


2250
02:28:00,063 --> 02:28:02,861


2251
02:28:10,440 --> 02:28:12,203
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave.

2252
02:28:12,375 --> 02:28:14,502
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dave. It's Robert.

2253
02:28:16,279 --> 02:28:17,746
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Dave!\n-Is he actually here?

2254
02:28:17,914 --> 02:28:19,643
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna kill him.

2255
02:28:20,116 --> 02:28:23,176
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Dave.\n-I'm calling S.F.P.D. Where's my gun?

2256
02:28:25,121 --> 02:28:28,056
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Dave.\n-Robert, go away.

2257
02:28:28,224 --> 02:28:30,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Dave, he made a mistake.\n-Get away from the window.

2258
02:28:31,094 --> 02:28:34,154
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'll meet you around front.\n-No, you won't.

2259
02:28:35,131 --> 02:28:37,258
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You have to hear this.\n-No, I don't, Robert.

2260
02:28:37,434 --> 02:28:39,902
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The birthday was the one time that he was weak.

2261
02:28:40,070 --> 02:28:42,937
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-The one time he gave something away.\n-I'm calling the police.

2262
02:28:43,106 --> 02:28:44,971
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Arthur Leigh Allen!

2263
02:28:50,113 --> 02:28:51,512
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you get that name?

2264
02:28:52,449 --> 02:28:56,351
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He called the Bellis' house. December '69. "I need to kill. Today's my birthday."

2265
02:28:56,519 --> 02:28:58,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was his birthday.

2266
02:28:58,521 --> 02:29:01,581
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Arthur Leigh Allen was born on December 18th.

2267
02:29:04,494 --> 02:29:06,155
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in here.

2268
02:29:07,997 --> 02:29:10,932
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Here you go.\n-Thanks.

2269
02:29:13,203 --> 02:29:15,103
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wrote me, you know?

2270
02:29:15,672 --> 02:29:19,768
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}2500 suspects, the only one who ever wrote me a letter was Leigh Allen.

2271
02:29:21,478 --> 02:29:24,914
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-They like to help, you know, sometimes.\n-Yes, Robert, I know.

2272
02:29:26,249 --> 02:29:28,911
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was arrested January 1975 for molestation.

2273
02:29:29,085 --> 02:29:30,712
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He sent me that when he got out.

2274
02:29:30,887 --> 02:29:33,617
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"If I can ever be of any help to you, just let me know.

2275
02:29:33,790 --> 02:29:37,191
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry I wasn't your man." And it's typewritten.

2276
02:29:37,360 --> 02:29:40,022
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Using a typewriter is not a crime.

2277
02:29:41,297 --> 02:29:43,458
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he knew Darlene.

2278
02:29:44,367 --> 02:29:46,665
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's in the Vallejo files.

2279
02:29:51,574 --> 02:29:55,032
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mulanax said that he was your favorite suspect...

2280
02:29:55,211 --> 02:29:59,807
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that you spent two years on him, and that nobody ever came close.

2281
02:30:02,085 --> 02:30:04,246
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the evidence said no.

2282
02:30:05,321 --> 02:30:07,482
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sherwood disqualified his handwriting.

2283
02:30:07,657 --> 02:30:10,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The same Sherwood that drinks like Paul Avery now?

2284
02:30:11,895 --> 02:30:15,729
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, you have Morrill saying this won't work, but you also have Terry Pascoe...

2285
02:30:15,899 --> 02:30:17,389
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-His protege.\n-Yeah, his protege.

2286
02:30:17,567 --> 02:30:19,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But a handwriting expert nonetheless.

2287
02:30:19,502 --> 02:30:21,834
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he's saying, "Do not disqualify this suspect."

2288
02:30:22,005 --> 02:30:23,666
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So the two cancel each other out.

2289
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:27,537
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't. It was Sherwood's case. He was the head of Questioned Documents.

2290
02:30:27,710 --> 02:30:31,976
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it went to trial, all the defense would have to do is call Sherwood to the stand.

2291
02:30:32,148 --> 02:30:36,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was no way of getting Allen into court, because there was no evidence.

2292
02:30:36,219 --> 02:30:38,551
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean? You have him with the ciphers.

2293
02:30:38,721 --> 02:30:40,916
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The military boot prints. The same size gloves.

2294
02:30:41,090 --> 02:30:44,582
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Most Dangerous Game. The watch. The background with school children.

2295
02:30:44,761 --> 02:30:48,322
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The misspellings of "Christ-mass." Knives. All circumstantial.

2296
02:30:48,498 --> 02:30:51,262
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paul Stine's shirt, his wallet, his keys.

2297
02:30:51,434 --> 02:30:54,926
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should have found one of those things in that trailer. We didn't.

2298
02:30:57,473 --> 02:31:01,307
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Catherine Allen states that Leigh cleaned out his trailer on Friday after work...

2299
02:31:01,477 --> 02:31:05,311
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and moved it to Santa Rosa on Saturday, August 7th, 1971.

2300
02:31:05,481 --> 02:31:08,939
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You interviewed him on August 4th. So he's cleaning out his trailer...

2301
02:31:09,118 --> 02:31:12,679
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...he's moving into a different county 48 hours after you interviewed him?

2302
02:31:14,824 --> 02:31:15,984
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Okay.

2303
02:31:16,159 --> 02:31:18,719
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Look at the stuff side by side, Dave.\n-All right.

2304
02:31:18,895 --> 02:31:21,625
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Arthur Leigh Allen and the Zodiac, their timelines.

2305
02:31:21,798 --> 02:31:24,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-When was the first murder in Vallejo?\n-Christmas, 1968.

2306
02:31:24,634 --> 02:31:27,432
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eight months before, Allen is fired for molesting students.

2307
02:31:27,604 --> 02:31:29,435
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His family discovers he's a pedophile.

2308
02:31:29,606 --> 02:31:31,767
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-When do the letters begin?\n-July '69.

2309
02:31:31,941 --> 02:31:33,932
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After the murder of Darlene Ferrin.

2310
02:31:34,110 --> 02:31:36,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they continue until you go to see him at work.

2311
02:31:36,679 --> 02:31:40,012
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After that, do any of the letters contain swatches of Stine's shirt?

2312
02:31:40,183 --> 02:31:43,175
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, he dumped them. He got scared. He knew you were onto him.

2313
02:31:43,353 --> 02:31:45,287
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So when's the next letter from Zodiac?

2314
02:31:45,455 --> 02:31:47,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not until January of 1974.

2315
02:31:47,824 --> 02:31:49,189
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is silent for three years.

2316
02:31:49,359 --> 02:31:52,988
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In '74, he feels comfortable again. Everybody's moved off Allen as a suspect.

2317
02:31:53,162 --> 02:31:57,656
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do we get? Three new letters from Zodiac in January, May and July in '74.

2318
02:31:58,334 --> 02:32:00,825
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-But then the letters stop.\n-What happens to Allen?

2319
02:32:05,074 --> 02:32:07,235
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's arrested.

2320
02:32:07,410 --> 02:32:10,641
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}January, 1975, they send him to Atascadero.

2321
02:32:10,813 --> 02:32:13,509
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't get another letter the entire time he's there.

2322
02:32:13,683 --> 02:32:16,345
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-When is he released?\n-August '77.

2323
02:32:16,519 --> 02:32:20,182
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Allen gets out. He types you an apology, and then what?

2324
02:32:20,356 --> 02:32:23,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We get our first new Zodiac letter in four years.

2325
02:32:29,299 --> 02:32:32,462
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Zodiac had to have known Darlene Ferrin, right?

2326
02:32:32,635 --> 02:32:34,967
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, the phone calls on the night of her murder.

2327
02:32:35,138 --> 02:32:39,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because of the Vallejo file, we know that Darlene knew a man named Leigh?

2328
02:32:39,876 --> 02:32:42,709
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yes.\n-So all coincidence aside, Robert...

2329
02:32:42,879 --> 02:32:45,746
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...how can you be sure that Leigh is the Leigh from this file?

2330
02:32:45,915 --> 02:32:49,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vallejo is small, but it's not that small. How do you put the two together?

2331
02:32:49,686 --> 02:32:52,348
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A case that's covered Northern and Southern California...

2332
02:32:52,522 --> 02:32:55,389
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...with victims and suspects spread over hundreds of miles...

2333
02:32:55,558 --> 02:32:57,788
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-...would you agree?\n-Yes.

2334
02:32:58,661 --> 02:33:01,152
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Darlene worked at the Vallejo House of Pancakes...

2335
02:33:01,331 --> 02:33:03,356
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...on the corner of Tennessee and Caroll.

2336
02:33:06,836 --> 02:33:11,068
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Arthur Leigh Allen lived in his mother's basement on Fresno Street.

2337
02:33:13,343 --> 02:33:17,905
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Door to door, that is less than 50 yards.

2338
02:33:20,116 --> 02:33:21,447
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that true?

2339
02:33:22,719 --> 02:33:24,482
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've walked it.

2340
02:33:27,990 --> 02:33:29,981
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus Christ.

2341
02:33:36,132 --> 02:33:37,793
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So?

2342
02:33:41,070 --> 02:33:44,039
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-The prints, the handwriting...\n-I'm not asking you as a cop.

2343
02:33:44,207 --> 02:33:46,198
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I am a cop.

2344
02:33:48,611 --> 02:33:50,374
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't prove this.

2345
02:33:50,546 --> 02:33:53,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just because you can't prove it, doesn't mean it's not true.

2346
02:33:53,816 --> 02:33:55,909
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy, Dirty Harry.

2347
02:33:59,021 --> 02:34:00,784
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finish the book.

2348
02:34:09,465 --> 02:34:12,764
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. Thank you for breakfast.

2349
02:34:36,692 --> 02:34:41,459


2350
02:35:20,169 --> 02:35:21,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I help you?

2351
02:35:23,439 --> 02:35:24,838
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

2352
02:35:55,671 --> 02:36:01,007


2353
02:36:08,484 --> 02:36:10,145


2354
02:36:45,521 --> 02:36:47,182
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Mageau.

2355
02:36:47,790 --> 02:36:51,317
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Thanks for coming to see me.\n-You're the one I talked to on the phone?

2356
02:36:51,494 --> 02:36:55,897
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm George Bawart, Vallejo P.D. I took over for Jack Mulanax.

2357
02:36:56,065 --> 02:36:59,034
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been 22 years. I don't know how I can help you.

2358
02:36:59,201 --> 02:37:01,897
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is just a formality. I'm gonna show you photographs.

2359
02:37:02,071 --> 02:37:05,507
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, the person that shot you may or may not be among these photographs.

2360
02:37:06,242 --> 02:37:09,734
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have to pick anybody because I'm showing you these, understand?

2361
02:37:09,912 --> 02:37:11,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir, I do.

2362
02:37:12,048 --> 02:37:13,845
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

2363
02:37:14,450 --> 02:37:16,179
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take your time.

2364
02:37:16,419 --> 02:37:18,979
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you don't recognize anyone, that's okay.

2365
02:37:30,700 --> 02:37:32,361
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's him.

2366
02:37:33,636 --> 02:37:35,297
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How sure are you?

2367
02:37:35,571 --> 02:37:37,232
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm pretty sure.

2368
02:37:40,309 --> 02:37:42,334
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He had a round face like this guy.\n-Wait.

2369
02:37:42,511 --> 02:37:44,672
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're now identifying this second photograph?

2370
02:37:44,847 --> 02:37:48,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. Just that he had a round face like that.

2371
02:37:49,785 --> 02:37:50,979
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's this man.

2372
02:37:52,021 --> 02:37:53,682
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

02:37:55,257 --> 02:37:59,057
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, on a scale of one to 10, 10 being positive...

2374
02:38:02,365 --> 02:38:04,299
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...how sure are you?

2375
02:38:07,737 --> 02:38:09,398
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least an eight.

2376
02:38:12,174 --> 02:38:17,111
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last time I saw this face was July 4th, 1969.

2377
02:38:19,315 --> 02:38:23,251
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am very sure that's the man who shot me.
