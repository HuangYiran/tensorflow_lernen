00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,080
1726年3月28日
On 28th March, 1726,

3
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,560
一口棺材被抬到了威斯敏斯特大教堂
a coffin was carried into Westminster Abbey.

4
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,200
棺材里的人曾经位高权重
In it was the body of a man who had held high office,

5
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,840
虽然他不是政客
although he wasn't a politician.

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,360
他曾将别人送上绞刑架 虽然他不是司法部官员
He had had men hanged, although he wasn't a member of the judiciary.

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,240
他写了很多关于《圣经》的文章
And he'd written extensively on Scriptures,

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,800
虽然他也不是牧师
although he was no cleric or priest.

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,400
他的棺材是由大法官
His coffin was carried by the Lord Chancellor,

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,280
两位公爵和三位伯爵抬到这的
two dukes and three earls.

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,400
这个人就是伊萨克・牛顿
That man was Isaac Newton.

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,840
能够下葬威斯敏斯特大教堂
To be buried in Westminster Abbey

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,120
通常是国王和贵族才有的荣誉
was an honour usually reserved for kings and nobles,

14
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,400
牛顿这样的平民是没有这样特权的
not commoners like Newton.

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,880
但牛顿并不是个平凡的人
But Newton was no ordinary man.

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,280
这里写道
Even here, it's written,

17
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,320
“众人因这样杰出的存在而欣喜”
"Mortals rejoice that there has existed such an ornament of the human race".

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,600
牛顿是第一位自然哲学家
Now, Newton was the first natural philosopher,

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
用现在的话来说 就是科学家
or scientist, as we now call him,

20
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,280
而人们以这种方式纪念他
to be honoured in this way.

21
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,680
但他一定不是最后一个
But he certainly wasn't the last.

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,520
这是詹姆斯・克拉克・麦克斯韦
And here is James Clerk Maxwell.

23
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,320
这是迈克尔・法拉第
Here, Michael Faraday.

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,240
这是保罗・狄拉克
And here, Paul Dirac.

25
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,480
人们还将他描述电子运动的方程
With his equation describing the behaviour of the electron

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,400
刻在了威斯敏斯特大教堂的地面上
inscribed into the stone on the floor of Westminster Abbey.

27
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,000
英国以这种方式
It's perhaps no coincidence

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,360
纪念其杰出的科学家
that a country that honours its leading scientists in this way

29
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,960
因此拥有数量众多的领路人和改革者
has produced far more than its fair share

30
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,360
也就不奇怪了
of trailblazers and innovators.

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,680
解码DNA 解释遗传的科学家们
Men and women who explained heredity by decoding DNA.

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,720
为每项太空计划提供物理学基础的科学家们
Who provided the physics for every space programme ever conceived.

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,320
利用万维网转变人类交流方式的科学家们
And transformed communication for ever with the World Wide Web.

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,520
这个系列里 我想考察
In this series, I want to explore Britain's pivotal role

35
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,920
英国在创建现代科学中发挥的关键作用
in creating modern science.

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,400
发掘每一个为现代科学做出贡献的人物
Reveal the characters who have made science what it is today.

37
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,960
揭示英国在过去的300年中
Show how Britain has used its scientific strength

38
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,080
如何运用其科学优势
for over 300 years.

39
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,480
探究英国科学路在何方
And explore what the future holds for British science.

40
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,720
英国科学家不断地
British scientists have made and continue to make,

41
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,800
做出重大科学发现
some of the great scientific discoveries.

42
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,520
但从历史的角度看
But of equal importance from a historical perspective,

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,320
同等重要的是科学研究手段的发展
was the development of the means by which we do science.

44
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,680
提出理论 实验论证
The idea that you build theories, you test them by experiment

45
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,800
最后发表结果
and you publish the results.

46
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,360
这就是科学方法
This is known as the scientific method.

47
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,120
也是科学的基础
It is the bedrock of science.

48
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,800
这是由英国科学家率先使用并不断完善的
And it was developed and first used, to a large extent, here in Britain.

49
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,120
这里是英国皇家学会
This is The Royal Society.

50
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,520
世界顶尖科学家的联盟
A fellowship of the world's most eminent scientists

51
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,120
成立于1660年
that has existed since 1660.

52
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,880
其成员几乎包括所有科学史上的重要人物
Its members include virtually all of the great names in science.

53
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,680
从达尔文到法拉第
From Charles Darwin to Michael Faraday.

54
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,360
就是这些人的构想和研究
These are people whose ideas and investigations

55
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,600
改变了我们对自然界的理解
have transformed our understanding of the natural world.

56
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,920
他们改变世界的行为
That they were able to perform such a transformation

57
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,560
已足够引人注目
is remarkable enough.

58
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,840
同样值得注意的是
But what's also remarkable

59
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,240
很多皇家学会成员
is that many of The Royal Society's members

60
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,400
都将他们的杰出成就
would've traced their towering achievements

61
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,000
归功到一个人的研究上
back to the work of one man.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,920
艾萨克・牛顿爵士
Sir Isaac Newton.

63
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,560
这是牛顿的死亡面具
This is Newton's death mask.

64
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,240
他死后
It's a plaster cast of his face

65
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,880
依照他面部做成的石膏模型
that would've been taken moments after he died.

66
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,320
趁尸体还有未凉
And the technique was to make these masks

67
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,360
人们做成这些面具
whilst the body was still warm.

68
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,760
这东西看起来确实很可怕
And it's really quite an eerie thing to look at.

69
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,280
如果你将牛顿看待成一位物理学家
When you think of Newton as a physicist,

70
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,800
那么就会认为牛顿就是一堆抽象理论的集合
you think of Newton as almost an abstract set of theories.

71
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,040
你知道 F = MA 力等于质量乘以加速度
You know, F = MA, force equals mass times acceleration.

72
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,680
想起他的万有引力定律
You think of his universal law of gravitation.

73
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,840
第一个普适的物理定律
That first universal, physical law that's still used to this day

74
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,720
今天依然应用此项定律向太阳系边缘或之外发射宇宙飞船
to send spacecraft to the edge of the solar system and beyond.

75
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,240
但看看这个
But when you look at this,

76
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,480
你会发现一个不同的牛顿
you see a different Newton.

77
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,120
仅仅是一个人
You see Newton, the man.

78
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,720
牛顿并不是很容易相处
Newton certainly wasn't the easiest person to get along with.

79
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,800
他强势 不怀好意
He was obsessive, malicious

80
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,640
而且易怒
and prone to outbursts of rage.

81
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,920
但他的工作方式
But there was something quite extraordinary

82
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,280
也有些不同寻常
about the way that he worked.

83
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,120
在人类依然信仰魔法的年代
In an age when people still believed in magic,

84
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,840
牛顿提出了革命性的理论框架
Newton devised a revolutionary theoretical framework

85
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,440
人们可以以此准确地探索自然的本质
with which to accurately investigate the nature of the world.

86
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,240
1642年 牛顿出生在
Newton was born in 1642

87
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,160
处于过渡期的英格兰
into an England that was a country in transition.

88
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,160
那年 英国内战正式爆发
That was the start of the English Civil War.

89
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,960
那是个人们仍在到处搜寻女巫的国家
It was a country where they were still hunting for witches.

90
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,240
但也是个科学 理性思考
But also, it was a country where science,

91
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,800
开始蓬勃发展的国家
where rational thought, where reason were beginning to flower.

92
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,120
当时 一个伟大的问题
Now, at the time, one of the great questions

93
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,360
是关于光的本质
was about the nature of light.

94
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,840
当时人们已经知道 如果你用太阳光照射棱镜
It was known that if you take a prism and shine sunlight through it,

95
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,080
棱镜则会将太阳光
then it splits that sunlight

96
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,240
分散成彩虹的颜色
into all the colours of the rainbow.

97
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,760
而问题就是为什么
The question was why.

98
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,680
之前主流的科学观点
Now, the prevailing scientific view

99
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,840
太阳光是完美的
was that sunlight must be perfect.

100
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,280
这要一路追溯到亚里士多德和其他古希腊哲学家
This dated all the way back to Aristotle and the Ancient Greeks.

101
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,560
来自上天的东西
How could something that comes from the heavens

102
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,400
怎么可能不是完美的
be anything other than perfect?

103
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,480
当时大部分人对此的解释
The common explanation for the appearance of the colours

104
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,720
是棱镜带来了杂质
was that they were impurities added by the prism

105
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,800
污染了纯净的白光
to the pure white light.

106
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,040
牛顿则认为这些颜色
Newton thought that the colours

107
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,600
原来就存在于白光中
were already present in the white sunlight.

108
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,320
但牛顿的可贵之处在于
But what set Newton apart

109
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,360
他设计了实验
was the fact that he devised and performed an experiment

110
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,200
并以此验证自己的假设
to test his hypothesis.

111
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,680
这就是牛顿的天才设计
Then, and here's the genius,

112
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,880
他在彩虹中放置了一条细缝
he introduced a slit into that rainbow beam.

113
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,080
这样他就可以分离出单色光
And that allowed him to isolate a particular colour of light

114
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,400
然后再将单色光照向第二个棱镜
and shine that into a second prism.

115
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:37,360
接着他观察有色光在墙壁上的偏转
Then he looked for the deflection of the coloured light onto his wall.

116
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,160
看 就在那
You can see that over there.

117
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,960
我现在将红光换成绿光
Now, look what happens

118
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,440
看看接下来会发生什么
when I move the red light across the slit, to the green light.

119
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,320
你会发现 照射在棱镜上的绿光
On the wall, what you see is green light into the prism

120
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,960
也就是发出的绿光
equals green light out.

121
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,240
这意味着颜色本身是纯净的
Now, that implies that the colours themselves are pure.

122
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,480
棱镜并没有添加或除去任何东西
The prism is not adding or subtracting anything.

123
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,000
这表明实验验证了牛顿的假设是正确的
That means that Newton's hypothesis was shown to be correct.

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,800
有色光本身
The colours themselves

125
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,240
就是光线的基本组成部分
are the basic building blocks of light.

126
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,960
白光是由所有的有色光组合起来的
And white light is made up of all those individual colours.

127
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
这太神奇了
That's genius.

128
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,000
牛顿率先使用今天所谓的“科学方法”
Newton was one of the first to interrogate nature

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,440
探索自然
using the principles of what we now call the scientific method.

130
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,880
换句话说 他观察世界
In other words, he observed the world,

131
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,960
提出理论解释观察到的现象
came up with theories to explain what he saw,

132
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,600
接着用实验验证这些理论十分正确
then tested them with experiments to see if he was right.

133
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,960
这种方法的优势在于
The power of this approach

134
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,340
它意图排除已先入为主的构想
is that it aims to remove preconceived ideas.

135
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,780
这么做 我们就可以
And in doing so, deliver a more accurate description

136
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,220
更加准确地描述自然界
of the natural world.

137
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,740
但他虽然思考清晰 实验技巧娴熟
But for all his clarity of thought and experimental technique,

138
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,180
但似乎没有意识到
Newton himself seems to have been strangely unaware

139
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,020
自己工作的重要性
of the importance of his work.

140
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,060
这本书十分珍贵
This is a priceless book.

141
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,380
它是牛顿著作《自然哲学的数学原理》
It is the first handwritten manuscript

142
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,620
的第一份手稿
of Newton's great masterpiece, the Principia.

143
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,900
书里第一次
It's in here the first time

144
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,500
描述了万有引力定律
that the universal law of gravitation is outlined.

145
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,260
他提出的运动定律
It's also his laws of motion

146
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,380
也解释了宇宙万物的运动
that say how objects move around in the universe.

147
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,580
这几乎是你大一整年
It's pretty much everything you do

148
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,300
要学的物理
in the first year of an undergraduate degree in physics.

149
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,500
而这本书背后的故事也令人着迷
And the story behind the writing of this book is fascinating.

150
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,580
它也揭露了牛顿的其他方面
It reveals a lot about Newton.

151
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,660
天文学家埃德蒙多・哈雷曾说过
The astronomer Edmond Halley said,

152
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,700
是否存在一个外有引力定律
"Is it true that there's a universal law of gravity

153
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,980
可以解释所有星球的可观测到的运行轨道
"that can explain the observed orbits of the planets?"

154
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,260
牛顿说 我已经证明了 几年前就证明过了
Newton said, "Yeah, I've proved it. I proved it a couple of years ago."

155
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,060
然后他开始找笔记
And he went to look for his notes,

156
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,300
但他找不到
and the story is that he couldn't find them.

157
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,740
接着他坐下来 开始重写这个证明过程
And so he just sat down and wrote the whole thing out again.

158
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:24,340
和哈雷的对话引出了整部《自然哲学的数学原理》
And it's that conversation with Halley that led to the Principia.

159
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,580
我们会惊奇地发现
So, it's interesting to speculate

160
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,100
如果把这事交给牛顿处理
that if it had been left up to Newton,

161
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,740
科学史上最伟大的著作
then maybe the greatest work in the history of science

162
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,340
根本就不会发表了
wouldn't have been published at all.

163
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,260
探索自然的乐趣对牛顿来说也已经足够了
The joy of exploring nature was enough for Newton.

164
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,860
著述 与别人分享知识
And the act of writing it down and sharing his knowledge

165
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,940
可能就是次要的了
with others was somehow secondary.

166
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,500
牛顿本身也充满了矛盾
Newton was certainly a man of contradictions.

167
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,700
他生活在17世界中叶
Given that he lived and worked in the middle of the 17th century.

168
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,980
站在理性时代的开端
He stood at the cusp, at the dawn of the Age of Reason.

169
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,300
毫无疑问 他处在两个世界中
And so, he was undoubtedly a man with feet in both worlds.

170
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,460
神秘世界和科学世界
The mystical and the scientific.

171
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,740
他是占星家 炼金术士
He was an astrologer, an alchemist,

172
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,500
但他也明白
but he was also a man who understood

173
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,620
什么是科学家
what it is to be a scientist almost innately.

174
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,580
他说我们可以
He said that the nature of things

175
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,060
通过物体间的相互作用
can be most naturally and securely deduced

176
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,020
而不是通过自己的直觉
by their operations one upon another,

177
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,940
推断出事物的本质
rather than upon the senses.

178
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,020
他想表达的是了解自然运转的唯一方法就是
By which he meant that the only way to understand how nature works

179
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,580
观察它
is to look at it

180
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,460
然后运用理性思考
and then use logic and reason

181
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,580
理解并解释自己观察到的现象
to understand and explain what you see.

182
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,820
从表面上看来 
On the face of it, it seems baffling

183
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,460
科学方法经过了很长时间才出现
that the scientific method took so long to emerge.

184
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,660
毕竟 牛顿就生活在几个世纪前
After all, Newton lived just a few hundred years ago.

185
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,620
问题的一部分就是
Part of the problem is that our world

186
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,260
我们生活的世界是个复杂且令人困惑的地方
is a complicated and baffling place.

187
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,220
但如果你将世界简化 那么就容易理解多了
But it's much easier to understand if you simplify it.

188
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,420
通过观察彩虹就可能推测出光的本质
It is possible to deduce the nature of light by investigating a rainbow.

189
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,620
但牛顿设计了一个可控可重复的实验
But by creating a controllable, repeatable experiment,

190
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,500
验证了自己的假设
Newton was able to support his hypothesis

191
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,220
接着将理解
and then transfer that understanding

192
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,140
扩展到实验室外更复杂的世界里
to the much more complex world outside the laboratory.

193
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,220
这个合理系统的方法
It's this logical, systematic approach

194
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,180
使英国科学
that has enabled British science

195
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,620
解释了自然界中
to shed light on nature's great mysteries,

196
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,340
小到物质结构 大到行星的轨道的难题
from the structure of matter to the orbits of the planets.

197
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,580
也因其在医学和科技上的应用
It's also improved our lives through its application

198
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,220
提高了我们的生活水平
to medicine and technology.

199
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,700
牛顿奠定基础的250年后
And 250 years after Isaac Newton laid its foundation,

200
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,340
科学方法
the scientific method

201
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,740
是整个英国在其黑暗时期的灯塔
provided Britain a lifeline in our darkest hour.

202
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,420
新闻影片：纳粹的计划就是断绝英国的粮食和军需品
NEWSREEL: 'Nazi strategy is to starve Britain of food and munitions.

203
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,860
派出大量纳粹潜水艇
'Scores of Nazi U-boats set out to harry the ships

204
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,700
掠夺向英国运输必要物资的船只
'that bring essential stocks and supplies to Britain.'

205
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,020
1940年 美国派出护航舰向英国运输粮食和军需品
In 1940, the convoys bringing supplies of food and ammunition

206
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,620
但它们都因德国潜水艇
from America to Britain were suffering a frightening rate of attrition

207
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,100
遭受到严重损失
at the hands of German U-boats.

208
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,100
丘吉尔和其他人
And Churchill and others genuinely thought

209
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,980
想到我们数周内就可能输掉这场战争
that we were within weeks of losing the war.

210
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,420
但最后还是成功摆脱了困境
Now, salvation came, not in the form of a new weapon system,

211
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,020
并不是因为造出了新的武器系统或者飞机或军舰
a new aircraft or warship,

212
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,140
而是因为一群有献身精神的人们
but at the hands of a few dedicated people,

213
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,380
可以说是天才
geniuses even,

214
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,540
拿起纸币
with pencils and paper,

215
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,740
在白金汉郡小屋内做出的努力
working here in sheds in Buckinghamshire.

216
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,340
布莱切利园是英国二战期间
Bletchley Park was the centre

217
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,660
破解德国密码的基地
for British code-breaking during World War II.

218
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,420
就是在这 分析拦截到的德国信息
It was here that intercepted German messages were brought for analysis.

219
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,860
杰瑞・罗伯茨上尉
Captain Jerry Roberts was part of the group

220
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,340
就参加了破解德国信息的计划
assigned the task of decrypting the daily flow of communications.

221
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,580
他当时刚毕业 有法语和德语的学位
He'd just graduated with a degree in French and German,

222
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,100
但他对国际象棋和填字游戏的浓重兴趣
but it was his keen interest in chess and crosswords

223
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,500
使他拥有了这项工作
that landed him the job.

224
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,940
你乐于接受
Did you take delight in just the intellectual challenge

225
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,380
每日破解敌方密码的挑战吗
of breaking the code every day?

226
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,820
因为你必须得保持高度的专注度
Did that almost, I don't know, remove from your mind

227
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,900
这有没有使你忽略了其他重要的事情
the bigger picture because you had to focus so much on that act?

228
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,420
我们都十分高兴破解工作取得了巨大的进展
We greatly enjoyed the process of breaking, you know?

229
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,740
确实很有趣
It was great fun.

230
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,580
老实说
I have to be quite honest

231
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:39,700
我们并没太在意会对战争产生什么影响
and say, we were not thinking too much about the impact on the war,

232
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,980
我们只是在考虑如何取得更大的进展
we were thinking about how we could get a bit further along, you know?

233
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,820
是的
Yeah.

234
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,740
纳粹无线电通信设备
The Nazi war machine ran on radio communications,

235
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,540
加密了战场上个部队
coded signals between the forces in the field

236
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,260
和柏林指挥地之间的信号
and the high command in Berlin.

237
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,820
大部分信息都被恩尼格玛密码机加密了
Most of the general traffic was encoded by a machine called Enigma.

238
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,500
罗伯茨抵达布莱切利之前
By the time Gerry Roberts arrived at Bletchley,

239
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,180
同盟国就因阿兰・图灵的工作
the Allies had broken the Enigma code thanks to the

240
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,420
破解了谜语机密码
mathematical work done by Alan Turing

241
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,860
还有另一个原因就是获取了正在工作的谜语机
and also because a working Enigma machine had been captured.

242
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,820
但更大的收获则是
But the big prize was another code that was

243
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,740
获取了为柏林最高级通讯保留下来的另一套密码
reserved for the highest level signals from Berlin.

244
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,500
它采取某些和谜语机一样的原则
It used some of the same principles as Enigma,

245
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,620
但却更加复杂
but it was far more complicated.

246
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,100
纳粹高级将领称之为洛仑兹密码
The Nazi high command knew this code as the Lorenz cipher.

247
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,060
而同盟国则称之为金枪鱼
The Allies called it Tunny.

248
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,700
金枪鱼拥有不止一级两级加密
Tunny had not one, not two,

249
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,380
它有三级加密
but three levels of encryption.

250
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,780
也从未被破译过
It should never, ever have been broken.

251
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:02,260
要不是因为害羞谦虚的比尔・塔特
And it might not have been were it not for the scientific approach

252
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,500
采取化难为易的科学方法
taken by a shy and unassuming man called Bill Tutte

253
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,220
这套密码也不会被破译
of reducing the complex to the simple.

254
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,540
接近三个月里
He dedicated every waking hour

255
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,180
他醒着的每一分钟都在破译密码
for nearly three months to cracking the code.

256
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,420
我和他坐在同一间办公室
I was actually sitting in the same office as he was

257
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,460
他在那工作
when he was doing it,

258
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,220
而我望着他
and I saw him staring into the middle distance,

259
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,460
看他摆弄自己的笔
twiddling his pencil,

260
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,940
在纸上演算着
and making counts on reams of paper,

261
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:44,980
我一直想知道他到底成功了没有
and I used to wonder whether he was getting anything done!

262
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,140
天啊 他终于成功了
My goodness, he was.

263
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,380
这就是人类伟大的壮举
It was an extraordinary feat of the mind.

264
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,180
太不可思议了 你知道塔特是如何做到的吗
I find it remarkable. Do you understand how Tutte did it?

265
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,620
部分是些计算 但主要是逻辑思考
It's partly mathematics, but mostly logic.

266
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,500
如果这个是这个 那个是那个
If this is this and that is that,

267
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,140
那么它必须遵循这个很可能是其他
then it follows that this must be the other conclusion.

268
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,340
同盟国里没有人见过产生金枪鱼的设备
No-one on the Allied side had seen the machine that produced Tunny.

269
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,980
所以塔特利用他的头脑和一支笔就破译了这套密码
So the fact that Tutte cracked the code with little more than his brain

270
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,540
这是天才才能完成的超凡工作
and a pencil is a testament to an extraordinary work of genius.

271
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,140
同盟国记录了已经发送过两次的
The Allies had recorded a message that had been sent twice

272
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,180
利用金枪鱼加密过的信息
using the same Tunny encryption or key.

273
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,980
就是这一个小小失误使
It was this tiny lapse in procedure that gave Tutte a way in

274
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,300
塔特有机会破解了整个系统
to crack the entire system.

275
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,780
他的方法十分科学
His approach was scientific.

276
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,180
因为所有信息是相似的 但不完全相同
Because the messages were similar, but not identical,

277
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,060
而且使用统一的密匙
and they used the same key,

278
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:57,620
所有他推测出一定存在重复的结构
he knew there would be repeated patterns

279
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,780
他如果可以通过仔细观察发现这些结构
and if he could find those patterns by careful observation,

280
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,580
那么就可以破解整套密码
he could crack the code.

281
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,260
他最后找到了一种结构
He eventually did find a pattern

282
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,140
这个结构里隐藏着一个素数 41
and in that pattern, was hidden a prime number - 41.

283
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:15,820
因此他提出假设
His hypothesis was this was the number of settings possible

284
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,620
41可能是金枪鱼密码机第一圈转子上的档数
for the first of Tunny's scrambling wheels

285
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,900
事实验证了他的假设
and this turned out to be correct.

286
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,020
这也是破解整个密码机的关键
It was the key to unlocking the entire cipher.

287
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,700
身为译解密码者
As a cryptographer,

288
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,060
我很难相信他竟然做到了
I find that almost impossible to believe that he did it.

289
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:38,700
有人称之为上个世纪伟大的智力创举
One man called it the outstanding mental feat of the last century.

290
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,500
不是战争 上个世纪
Not the war, the last century.

291
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:49,180
和恩尼格玛密码机破译者不一样 塔特从没见过
Unlike the Enigma code-breakers, Tutte had never seen the machine

292
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,820
纳粹如何使用设备产生代码
the Nazis used to produce the code that he cracked.

293
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,260
但仅通过逻辑思考 仔细观察
But by using logic, careful observation

294
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,700
以及大胆假设
and by producing testable hypotheses,

295
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,540
他就成功破解了密码机的工作原理
he managed to determine exactly how it worked.

296
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,820
这意味着我们有可能造出
And that meant it was possible to build a machine

297
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,500
一台机器自动破译加密信号
to automatically decipher the coded signals as they were issued.

298
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,020
比尔・塔特利用科学方法就是同盟国
By applying a scientific approach, Bill Tutte allowed the Allies

299
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,500
可以监听纳粹高官说过的每一个字
to listen in to virtually every word uttered by the Nazi high command,

300
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,100
而产生的结果也是惊人的
and the consequences were breathtaking.

301
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:49,740
我也相当怀疑有时我们的将军会比德国将军
I strongly suspect that our generals sometimes saw the text

302
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,540
先看到解密后的信息
of the messages before the blessed German generals did!

303
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,740
艾森豪威尔将军在战后曾说
General Eisenhower said, after the war,

304
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,580
布莱奇利的破译工作
that Bletchley decrypts helped shorten the war

305
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,660
将战争缩短了至少两年
by at least two years.

306
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,140
至少两年
At LEAST two years.

307
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,340
而这场战争里
And this was a war

308
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,980
每年平均会有一千万人丧生
in which ten million people died each year on average.

309
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,420
比尔・塔特完成了似乎不可能的任务
Bill Tutte had achieved the seemingly impossible.

310
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,340
他仅通过逻辑原理
He'd done it by applying the principles of logic

311
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,380
就做到了
enshrined in the scientific method.

312
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,660
但这仅仅是故事的一部分
But that's only part of the story.

313
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,140
在他还没听过金枪鱼或布莱切利园的很久以前
Tutte was fascinated by problem-solving

314
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,300
他就着迷于解决问题
long before he'd ever heard of Tunny or Bletchley Park.

315
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,380
和牛顿 达尔文 法拉第
Like Newton, Darwin, Faraday

316
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,300
和其他数不尽的科学们一样
and countless other scientists before and since,

317
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,340
塔特爱好 甚至着迷于
Tutte was interested in, perhaps even obsessed by,

318
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,900
了解事物如何运转
discovering how things work.

319
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,580
理查德・博切尔兹就是当代的塔特
Richard Borcherds is a latter-day Tutte.

320
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:13,260
首先我先将平方先加起来 0的平方 加上1的平方 加上2的平方
..First I start adding up squares, so I take nought squared, plus one squared, plus two squared...

321
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,620
他现在是加州大学伯克利分校的数学教授
He's a professor of mathematics at the University of California at Berkeley.

322
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,500
这是一个椭圆模函数
An elliptic modular function looks like this...

323
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,500
另一位尝试破解
Another British scientist on a quest

324
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,300
似乎不能破解的密码的英国科学家
to solve an apparently uncrackable code.

325
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,740
我不仅尝试理解宇宙如何运转
What I'm doing is trying to understand

326
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,260
也要搞清楚它为什么存在 为什么运转
not just how the universe works, but why it exists or why it works.

327
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,460
这个问题听起来很可怕
That's a very scary question that...

328
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,980
你知道 宇宙为什么存在
You know, why does the universe exist at all?

329
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,100
过去的15年里 理查德一直试图解决抽象问题
Richard has spent the last 15 years trying to solve an abstract problem

330
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,740
它是量子场理论的核心
that lies at the heart of quantum field theory,

331
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,900
而量子场理论最好地
our best current description

332
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,220
描述了自然界的基础
of the building blocks of the natural world.

333
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,100
这个问题已经困扰了数学家将近一个世纪
It's something that has defeated mathematicians for almost a century,

334
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,340
但理查德不为所动
but Richard is undeterred.

335
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,980
他每天都在攻克这个难题
He spends many hours a day working on the problem.

336
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,580
看我工作和看我睡觉
Watching me work is pretty much indistinguishable

337
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,540
没什么大的不同
from watching me sleeping.

338
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,780
我一般会这样的坐很久
I'd generally just be sort of sitting there like this...

339
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,180
就是想问题
for a long time, just thinking.

340
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,820
大部分时候你问我这个月有什么进展
Most months you ask me what I've produced this month

341
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,180
我一般会说 嗯 我发现这个想法行不通
and I will say, "Well, I've discovered this idea doesn't work."

342
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,860
就是这样
And that's it.

343
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,940
大部分的工作不是在计算
Most of the work is not in doing calculations,

344
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,180
而是搞清楚要计算什么
but in trying to figure out what calculations to do.

345
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,460
而这要花要用多年的时间 
That's the part of mathematics that takes years

346
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,900
却毫无进展
and years without really getting anywhere.

347
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,060
毫无疑问 理查德智力超群
Richard has, without question, an unusual mind.

348
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,220
和布莱切利园一样聪明
A mind similar to the Bletchley Park code-breakers.

349
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:14,820
他连续多年完成看似不能完成的任务
One capable of dedicating years on end to the almost incomprehensible task

350
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,380
理解支撑着宇宙的抽象数学
of understanding the abstract mathematics that underpins the universe.

351
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,700
虽然他付出了超出常人的努力
But although his dedication may appear extreme,

352
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,380
但执念似乎是所有科学家拥有的共性
it seems that an element of obsessiveness is something that many scientists share.

353
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,780
从牛顿到迪拉克
From Isaac Newton to Paul Dirac,

354
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,740
从麦克斯韦到塔特再到博切尔兹
James Clerk Maxwell to Bill Tutte and Richard Borcherds,

355
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,500
英国不断地涌现出发愤图强的科学家
Britain has produced an array of driven scientists

356
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,540
为科学进步做出了重大贡献
who have contributed enormously to our understanding.

357
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,180
他们的脱颖而出并不是因为他们的财富 权力 或者恶名
They stand out, not because of their wealth, power or notoriety,

358
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,940
而来自他们独特的思考方式
but because of the way they thought.

359
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,620
原因可能是他们将科学放在了首要位置
Which might be the reason that they were drawn to science in the first place.

360
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,980
拜伦・科恩教授研究了科学家们的心理状态后
Professor Simon Baron-Cohen studies the psychology of scientists

361
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,900
发现大多数科学家有一些共同的特征
and has discovered that many of them share some specific characteristics.

362
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,460
研究对象中的大部分
Many people in the population

363
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,460
都喜欢在聊天时经常变换话题
are quite happy to flit from one topic to another.

364
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:34,220
他们乐意聊天 但都不想超过半个小时
They're happy to chat about something, but they don't want to go on about it for half an hour,

365
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,580
更别说几小时 几天 几周了
let alone many, many hours, or days or weeks.

366
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,580
我想 拥有科学头脑的人不想停留在一个话题上
And, I think, someone with a scientific mind often does want to stay on one topic,

367
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:51,060
无论在研究什么 他们都想更加深入地了解
they want to go deeper into whatever they're studying.

368
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,300
我笑是因为我也这样
Now, I'm grinning because I definitely see that in myself,

369
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,020
我太太也一定这么想的
and my wife would certainly say that that's the case.

370
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,140
一旦我聊起某些事
Once I start talking about something

371
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,500
我不太可能聊很久
I'm likely not to talk about anything else for a long time. Yeah.

372
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,300
这确实很有趣 我认识到了这一点
That's interesting, actually, cos I recognise that.

373
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,700
而且不会产生消极影响
Yeah, but it's not negative, that's the point.

374
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,980
我们在讨论重视深度而不是广度的头脑
That, effectively, we're talking about a mind that prioritises depth over breadth.

375
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,500
这以前常被看成是不好的行为
And that used to be seen as something negative,

376
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:22,180
你太执着自己痴迷的事物 人们不会鼓励你这么做的
that if you go too deeply into something you're obsessional and it should be discouraged.

377
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:26,420
但现在我们发现 除非你是飞机设计师
But what we can now see is that... Unless you're the aircraft designer that designed the aircraft

378
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,060
正设计自己要乘坐的飞机 这真是理想的工作啊
you're sitting on. In which case, it would be desirable!

379
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:33,140
我很庆幸飞机设计师十分执着
I'm delighted that the aircraft designer is obsessional, yeah. Yeah.

380
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,100
西蒙的研究又发现了
As part of his research, Simon has shown another trait

381
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,460
科学家身上更普遍的特征――对细节的注意
to be more common amongst scientists - attention to detail.

382
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,660
这个例子很好地显示了我们怎样观察你对细节的关注度
This is an example where we're looking at how well you can pick up detail.

383
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:51,820
你可以多快地在整个设计中找出目标性状
So, how quickly you can find the target shape hidden in the overall design.

384
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,100
科学家在这项试验中表现得比普通人优秀
Scientists are quicker at this test than non-scientists,

385
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,060
再一次强调 我们不是仅在讨论古怪的性格
and again, we're not just talking about eccentricity now,

386
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,540
其实我们在寻找某个特定的心理过程
we're actually looking at a specific psychological process.

387
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:09,860
西蒙通过调查问卷可以测量一个被他称为“系统化”的品质
Using a questionnaire, Simon has also measured a trait he calls "systemising".

388
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:14,180
这是驱动人们理解
This is the drive and ability that people have to understand

389
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,580
从天气到地图 从政治到引擎
how things work, from the weather to road maps,

390
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,780
大千事物运转的能力
from politics to car engines.

391
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,540
这些问题关于
There are questions in there about how interested

392
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,220
你对家里的电线有多大兴趣
you are in the electrical wiring in your house.

393
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,220
我十分感兴趣
I'm very interested in that.

394
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,860
嗯 那你就得分了 在这题上得了一份
So, you would probably score, you know, you'd score one point

395
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,500
还有很多类似的问题
on that item and there are lots of items of that kind.

396
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,620
小时候某次过生日 还收到过一个保险丝盒
I once got a fuse box for my birthday when I was young,

397
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:43,420
实际上是我要的 嗯 大概是12岁的时候 这是什么意思
I actually asked for a fuse box. Right. It was my 12th birthday or something, what does that say?

398
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:47,060
嗯 它在证实测试的有效性
Well, it's telling us that the test has validity.

399
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,380
耶 系统化头脑的标准
Yeah! It's a sign of a systematic mind.

400
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,420
另一项有趣的发现是
What's also interesting is that the personality trait

401
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,460
西蒙展示的科学家拥有的性格特质
Simon has shown to be characteristic of scientists

402
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,420
表现在自闭症儿童的身上
are expressed in their extreme in children with autism.

403
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,220
我们知道自闭症儿童往往有社交障碍
Kids with autism we know have difficulty socialising,

404
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,340
但他们通常十分留意细节
but they often have excellent attention to detail

405
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,060
他们喜欢在事物中寻找特定的模式 就像科学家一样
and they like to look for patterns in things, just like a little scientist really.

406
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,420
下面举个点灯开关的例子
An example might be electrical light switches,

407
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,060
他们想知道把开关扳到开或关
that they want to look at the effect of putting a light switch

408
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,900
会对整间房子产生什么效果
into different positions, the on and off position, all around the house.

409
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,900
嗯 这就是个实验 你说的很对 科学方法从根本上说
So it's experimentation. It is. Essentially the scientific method

410
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,620
就是孤立某个特定系统 然后
in action, just isolating a particular system and...

411
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,780
嗯 但这是在真实世界里
It is, but it's in the real world, absolutely.

412
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,900
我的意思是 没有把科学家
I mean, there's no claim in which you would label scientists

413
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,500
贴上自闭症的标签 很可笑
as autistic in some sense, it's ridiculous.

414
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,740
确实没有
Absolutely not, that is ridiculous.

415
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,180
数据告诉我们 在相关的测验中
What the evidence is telling us is that on specific measures of relevance,

416
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,020
科学家的得分
scientists are just scoring mid-way

417
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:56,340
正好在自闭症患者和其他人之间
between people with autism and the rest of the population.

418
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,140
大部分人都能猜到
It will come as no surprise to most people,

419
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,580
科学家身上有某些特别的性格特征
that there are certain character traits that we associate with scientists,

420
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,660
想解构世界的想法
the idea that you want to deconstruct the world,

421
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,740
对最微小细节的留意
that you pay attention to the smallest details.

422
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:25,420
我发现我还是小孩的时候 身上就有一些特征
Actually, I can identify some of those traits in myself as a child.

423
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,620
西蒙问过我关于收集东西的问题
Some of the questions that Simon asked me about of collecting things...

424
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,780
我 我喜欢观察公交车 然后在名单上打勾
I was... I liked to spot buses and tick them off in a list,

425
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,500
我也喜欢观察火车
I liked to do the same with trains.

426
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:41,020
我还喜欢收集电路 绕起来 看它怎么工作
I also liked to collect electrical apparatus and wire it up and understand how it works.

427
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,580
我猜 回想起来 这些都预示着
And, I suppose, in retrospect, that may have marked me out

428
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,940
我长大后可能成为一名科学家
as being statistically more likely to be a scientist when I grew up.

429
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,420
科学家对研究对象的关注
Scientists' dedication to their subject may sometimes appear

430
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,860
有时可能会显得十分古怪甚至诡异
to be quirky or even eccentric.

431
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,660
但这来自于很多科学家都有的特性
But it stems from a trait that I think many scientists share -

432
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,860
对世界万物的好奇心
an all-embracing curiosity.

433
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,660
这是唯一一张亨利・卡文迪许的画像
This is the only picture of Henry Cavendish,

434
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:21,060
因为他不喜欢坐在那让别人给自己画像 事实上 他从未这么做过
and the reason is that he was very uncomfortable about sitting for portraits. In fact, he never did it.

435
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,980
所以这张照片是一位艺术家晚餐时瞟了他一眼
So this was done mainly by an artist who glimpsed him over dinner

436
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,980
然后仅凭记忆画出来的
and then sketched it from memory.

437
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,100
他显示了卡文迪许身上所有的古怪特质
It shows all the essential eccentric features of the man.

438
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,220
他戴着一顶
He's wearing a hat which has been described as something

439
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,900
仿佛来自上世纪的帽子
from the previous century.

440
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,940
他生活在18世纪
Remember, this is a man who was living in the 1700s,

441
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,620
可戴了一顶17世纪的三角帽
so he's got a 17th-century three-cornered hat.

442
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,660
他也经常穿同一件外套 他十分喜欢这件外套
And he always wore the same coat and he liked it

443
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,300
因为经常穿它
so much that every year when it wore out,

444
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,180
衣服每年都会破
because he wore it every day,

445
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,180
而他都会再定制一健一模一样的外套
he had a new one, exactly the same, tailored.

446
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,740
卡文迪什生命中的主要目的就是
Cavendish's main aim in life was to weigh, measure and classify

447
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:10,820
尽可能测量 分类宇宙中的万物
as many objects in the universe as he possibly could,

448
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,260
幸运的是 和当时很多科学家一样
and fortunately, like many scientists at the time,

449
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:20,140
他家境富裕 可以由他
he was fabulously wealthy so he was able to indulge his curiosity

450
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,180
做各种各样神奇的实验
with hundreds of extraordinary experiments.

451
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,580
就像
Like this one,

452
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,140
1766年他第一次描述的这个实验
which he first reported in 1766.

453
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,660
需要几块金属
It involves taking a metal,

454
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,380
这里我们用锌
we'll take zinc,

455
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,580
然后倒入
and then I'm going to pour

456
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,500
浓盐酸
concentrated hydrochloric acid onto the zinc.

457
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,780
接着把产生的气体导入肥皂溶液
Now I'm going to bubble the gas that's produced  into this soap solution,

458
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:01,380
现在这些气泡将充满这种气体
so these bubbles are now going to be filled with this gas,

459
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,620
要十分迅速 十分小心 点燃气体
and very quickly and carefully I'm going to light the gas.

460
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,980
GAS POPS

461
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:12,820
卡文迪什称它为
Now, Cavendish called that, not inappropriately,

462
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,620
易燃的气体
I suppose, "inflammable air".

463
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:20,060
现在都知道这种气体就是氢气
It's the gas that we now know as hydrogen.

464
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,500
GAS POPS

465
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,140
但卡文迪什并没有就此打住
But Cavendish didn't stop there,

466
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:28,580
他继续顽固地试图定量地研究氢气
he doggedly continued his quest to quantify hydrogen

467
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,860
希望能够描述氢气的各种特征
until he could describe every aspect of its existence.

468
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,620
他想知道他新发现的气体
So, he wanted to see how his newly discovered gas,

469
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,780
现在被称作氢气
hydrogen, as we now call it,

470
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,980
如何跟其他物质反应 也包括空气在内
reacted with other things, including air.

471
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,740
现在我要重现卡文迪什的实验
So, I'm going to repeat Cavendish's experiment again

472
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,020
但这次要使用烧瓶
but this time with a vessel.

473
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,700
我想将它充满氢气
What I'm going to do is fill it with hydrogen...

474
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,420
GAS HISSES

475
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:00,660
现在这里充满了易燃的气体 然后点燃它
So, that's full of inflammable air, and I'm going to light the spark.

476
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,860
COMPUTER BEEPS

477
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,340
LOUD BANG

478
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,060
刚才我们看到的是一个化学反应
Now, what you saw there was a chemical reaction,

479
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,500
氢气和空气反应 你要是近距离
the reaction of hydrogen with air, and if you look closely

480
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,940
观察烧瓶的里面
on the sides of the flask,

481
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,580
你会发现它是 它是湿的
you'll see that it's... Well, it's wet.

482
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,500
这是水 是整个化学反应的产物
That is water and it's appeared as a result of the chemical reaction.

483
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,340
卡文迪什身上充分表现了科学是什么
In many respects, Cavendish embodies what science

484
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,820
以及科学家是什么
and what being a scientist is all about.

485
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,260
他对世界的好奇心驱动着他
His curiosity about the world drove him to design experiments

486
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,340
设计实验 以新的视角探索宇宙
in an effort to gain new insights into the way the world works.

487
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:50,060
卡文迪什其实不知道这些化学反应中到底发生了什么
Now, Cavendish didn't really have any idea what happened in these chemical reactions,

488
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:54,300
他全部的理论基础在现在看来都是错的
indeed his whole theoretical framework was nonsense to modernise,

489
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,940
它建立在炼金术的基础上
it was based on alchemy.

490
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,780
他当时认为物质会燃烧是因为它们含有一种叫燃素的成分
He thought things burned because they contained a substance called "phlogiston".

491
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,860
LOUD BANG

492
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,180
尽管这错得离谱
But even though that is complete nonsense,

493
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,780
但他是个优秀的实验科学家
because he was a great experimental scientist,

494
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:14,380
测量也十分准确 所以他成功测出
his measurements were correct, so he managed to measure that water

495
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,900
水是由两份氢和一份氧组成的 H2O
is made of two parts of hydrogen to one part of oxygen, H2O,

496
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:24,620
即使他根本就不相信水是由任何成组成的
even though he didn't believe that water was made of anything at all!

497
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:28,660
这种能力可以证明你关于宇宙运行
So, that ability to get your theoretical picture,

498
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,940
的理论认识和想法彻底错误
your ideas about the way that nature works completely wrong,

499
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,740
并且确保你的测量可靠准确
and yet make honest and precise measurements

500
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,780
足以接受时间的考验
that stand the test of time and are correct,

501
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,620
而这种能力恰恰是一位成功的实验科学家的标志
is the mark of a great experimental scientist.

502
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:52,300
毫无疑问 卡文迪什是英国史上最优秀的科学家之一
Cavendish has rightly gone down in history as one of this country's greatest scientists,

503
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,660
但他更多地被人们联想到
but perhaps he should be remembered more for his association

504
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,100
他和科学其他方面的联系
with another aspect of science,

505
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,780
因为他曾参与创立
because he was instrumental in establishing this place

506
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,180
位于伦敦阿尔伯马尔街21号的机构
at 21, Albemarle Street, London.

507
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,660
英国皇家研究所
The Royal Institution.

508
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:25,540
这个壁炉在英国科学史上占据重要位置
This fireplace occupies a central place in the history of British science.

509
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,180
它是一间位于索霍广场的房子的一部分
It was part of a house in Soho Square

510
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:32,700
而就在这间房子里 英国科学史上三位优秀的科学家
where three of the great characters in British scientific history

511
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,460
聚在一起 讨论着英国英国科学研究所的建设
gathered to discuss the foundation of this place, The Royal Institution.

512
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,980
这三人之一是伦福德伯爵
Those three men were Count Rumford of Bavaria,

513
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,380
他阅历丰富
who is a colourful character.

514
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:46,460
出生于美国 当过兵 搞慈善
He was born in America, he was a soldier, a philanthropist,

515
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:51,020
也是科学家和工程师 还是个花花公子
a scientist, an engineer. And many people say, a philanderer.

516
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,740
还有卡文迪什
Then there was Cavendish,

517
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,900
英国科学家和实验者中最古怪的人
that most eccentric of British scientists and experimenters.

518
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,660
最后还有约瑟夫・班克斯 
And finally, there was Joseph Banks who is an iconic figure

519
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,740
18、19世纪科学的代表人人物
in 18th and 19th-century science.

520
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:07,780
他的科学生涯开始于1768年 他当时是一位植物学家
He began his scientific career as a botanist aboard the Endeavour

521
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:12,220
和库克船长一起乘坐奋进号前往大溪地岛
with Captain Cook in 1768 on the journey to Tahiti

522
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,180
观测金星移动
to measure the transit of Venus.

523
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,700
而他也不是众人眼中的科学家样子
And he was not a stereotypical scientist,

524
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,460
我见过人们这样描述他 头上的卷发犹如浓密的荆棘丛
I've seen him described as a man with a thick bramble of curly hair,

525
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,660
浑身散发着神秘和浪漫
he had a brooding, romantic intensity.

526
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,100
他说话方式更像呼啸山庄里的希斯克利夫
He sounds more like Heathcliff than a man of science.

527
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:34,060
尽管班克斯担任长达40年的科学研究所主席
But Banks, although he was president of The Royal Society for 40 years,

528
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,820
他仍热衷于使科学走向大众
was passionate about democratising science.

529
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,460
他认为英国科学有些与世隔绝
He felt that British science was to insular -

530
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,540
专属于富人和名人的 与达官贵人关系紧密
a preserve of the rich, famous, and politically well-connected.

531
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,380
因此这三人想以这个阶梯教室为中心
And so the three of them came up with the idea for this place,

532
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,580
建立这个研究所
centred around this lecture theatre.

533
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:55,420
他们希望公众可以在这了解得重大的科学发现
Where the vision was that the public could hear of the great discoveries of science.

534
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,140
英国皇家研究所成为了孕育
The Royal Institution became a platform for a new breed -

535
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,180
科学新人的摇篮
a science personality.

536
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:18,460
从与科学共舞的汉弗莱・戴维
From Humphry Davy, the showman who famously danced with joy at his scientific discoveries,

537
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,940
到开始“圣诞节讲座”传统
to Michael Faraday, who began the tradition

538
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,580
的迈克尔・法拉第
of giving the, now famous, Christmas lectures.

539
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:31,860
如今 科学家仍使用这间讲堂与公众互动
And the theatre is still used by scientists to engage with the public to this day.

540
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,460
如果现在我移除过滤器
If now I remove the filter...
LOUD BANG

541
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,340
将发生奇妙的事情
..something happens.

542
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,020
DULL BOOM

543
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,060
APPLAUSE

544
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,660
就在这样
Oh, yes!

545
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,460
APPLAUSE

546
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,700
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

547
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,660
请拿一些肥皂泡里的氢气
So, I'd like you to grab some of that hydrogen in the soap bubbles.

548
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,740
Um...

549
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,980
沃 噢 你还好吧
Whoa! Ow! You all right?

550
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,660
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

551
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,660
班克斯和他的团队是正确的 人们的确想
Banks and his colleagues were right, people really do want to hear

552
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,500
了解科学和工程上的发现
about the findings of science and engineering,

553
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,020
想了解宇宙探索
about the exploration of the universe.

554
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:16,460
在皇家研究所举办的公益讲座十分受欢迎
So popular were the public lectures here at the Royal Institution,

555
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:22,220
而阿尔伯马尔街也挤满了前来聆听讲座的马车
so crowded was Albemarle Street with horses and carriages delivering people to hear those lectures,

556
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,500
阿尔伯马尔街因此成为了伦敦的第一条单行道
that Albemarle Street had to be made the first one-way street in London.

557
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,660
英国帮助了科学方法的传播
Britain helped to give the world what we now call the scientific method.

558
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:42,020
诞生了如牛顿 卡文迪什这样
It produced great scientists like Newton and Cavendish

559
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:46,180
运用实验探究世界的科学家
who used experimentation to make discoveries.

560
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,300
英国率先认识到
It was amongst the first countries to understand

561
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,220
对科学的追求是国家实力的重要组成部分
that the pursuit of science is a vital part of nationhood,

562
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:00,100
而公众参与则保障了科学持续发展
and that public engagement ensures science's bloodline.

563
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,540
另一件发生在英国的事很可能
But there's another British phenomenon that has had perhaps

564
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,780
已深深影响了科学进步
the greatest impact on the progress of science,

565
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:15,820
那就是著述分享的简单行为
and that is the simple act of writing down and sharing ideas.

566
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,140
分享的源头可以追溯到
The roots of that sharing can be traced

567
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,620
科学史上某本里程碑似的著作
to one of the most iconic books in the history of science.

568
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:29,260
它极其珍贵 被存放在一间温度可控的地下室
It's considered so valuable that it's kept in a climate-controlled vault.

569
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:38,180
出版于1665年 
Published in 1665, this is the first edition

570
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:41,380
第一期的英国皇家学会《自然科学会》
of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.

571
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,700
它是第一本科学期刊
It is the first scientific journal.

572
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,260
我认为能够准确描述科学期刊是什么的人
And I think the best description of what scientific journals mean

573
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,660
非首任编辑奥尔登伯格莫属
should be left to the first editor, Oldenburg,

574
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,620
他写道 创立期刊的目的是
who wrote that the purpose of this

575
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:01,780
让科学家用自己的知识影响其他科学家
is to allow scientists to "impart their knowledge to one another

576
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,860
并为积累自然知识以及完善哲学和科学
"and contribute what they can to the grand design of improving natural knowledge

577
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:11,300
的伟大机制做出最大的贡献
"and perfecting all philosophical arts and sciences".

578
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:18,020
亨利・奥尔登伯格首次为科学家
Henry Oldenburg had created a platform, where for the first time,

579
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,860
提供交流彼此科学发现的平台
scientists could widely share their findings with others.

580
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:28,820
这就是出版和展示科学知识
So this is the publication, the presentation, of scientific knowledge

581
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:35,820
如果你走进这里 翻翻数年来出版的自然科学会报
and if you step through here and follow the Philosophical Transactions on through the years,

582
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:41,980
你会发现所有著名科学家都在这发表过自己的研究
you will find all the great names of science publishing their research in here for all to see.

583
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:46,500
有牛顿 有达尔文 有法拉第
So, you'll find Newton, you'll find Darwin, you will find Faraday,

584
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:53,780
这里就是存放所有人类拥有的知识的地方
this is where the sum total of human knowledge is stored and archived and rests.

585
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,860
科学史就在这呈献给大家
So, the history of science is laid out for everyone to see, here.

586
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,260
是不是很奇妙
Isn't that wonderful?

587
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:16,060
印刷第一期会报的将近350年之后
Nearly 350 years after that first issue was printed,

588
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:21,500
皇家学会依然在出版自然科学会报
the Royal Society still publishes its Philosophical Transactions,

589
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,220
而且每一期都会存放在这间图书馆里
and every issue of that journal is kept here in their library.

590
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,220
随便拿出一本
It's fascinating to just grab them at random.

591
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,180
这本出版于1897年 这上面写着
Here's one from 1897, and it's on,

592
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,460
我甚至看不懂这些字
I don't even know the words,

593
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,900
小脑传入和传出神经
"afferent and efferent tracks of the cerebellum",

594
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,820
和神经的再生
and the regeneration of nerves.

595
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:52,140
这本出版于1895年 有机草酰胺
And then you can go, here's one, 1895, "organic oxymides,

596
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:57,340
（完全不懂）
"or the organisation of the fossil plants of the coal measures".

597
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,820
显而易见 找到关于自然有趣的新发现
Now, obviously there's no point in finding interesting things out

598
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,500
而不告诉别人是没有意义的
about the natural world and keeping them to yourself,

599
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,340
而真正的意义就在于向公众展示这些发现
not telling anyone, but there's much more to publishing than that.

600
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,380
这期自然科学会报
This is an edition of the Philosophical Transactions

601
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,260
出版于1861年
of the Royal Society from 1861,

602
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,700
其中一篇约翰・丁达尔的文章
and one of the papers here by John Tyndall

603
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,260
就展示了
is one of the first pieces of research

604
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,500
如今被称为“温室效应”的早期研究
on what we now call the "greenhouse effect",

605
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,620
而温室效应则是气体会吸收热量
the way that different gases absorb heat.

606
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:32,220
好几个表格的实验结果
There is table after table of results,

607
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:36,740
他也准确讲述了他如何获得这些数据
but he also describes precisely how he got those results,

608
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:42,180
而且这张图也描绘了他的实验器材
and there's a beautiful diagram of his apparatus,

609
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:48,660
其他人如果怀疑数据结果的真实性
and this is there so that anyone else reading this paper, if they're sceptical about the results

610
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:53,020
或者仅仅是想验证一下 他们都可以自己搭建仪器
or even if they just want to check them, can rebuild the apparatus

611
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:57,900
重新做一次实验 看看丁达尔到底犯没犯错误
and redo the experiments and check that Tyndall didn't make any mistakes.

612
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,740
所有这些数据不是见仁见智的 它们就在这
So these results are not a matter of opinion, they're here,

613
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,420
已经被其他科学家检验过了 证实过了
they can be checked by other scientists, they can be verified.

614
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:08,220
这就是科学知识如何积累进步的
So, this is how scientific knowledge progresses.

615
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:14,740
出版就是解释科学为什么可以成为我们看待宇宙的最好方法的答案
Publishing is the reason why science gets to our best view of the way that nature works.

616
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,780
只从1665年第一期自然科学会报出版
Since the Philosophical Transactions emerged in 1665,

617
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:36,540
目前也出现方方面面的科学期刊
thousands of journals have been published on every aspect of science.

618
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,540
科学期刊因为备受信任正以此种方式蓬勃发展
Scientific journals have flourished in this way because they can be trusted.

619
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:50,460
期刊上出版的内容都尽可能接近事实陈诉
What's printed in them is as close to a statement of fact as you can hope for.

620
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:55,780
我可以完全相信科学
And we can trust in that science

621
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:00,220
原因就是诞生于英国的一种独特自我调节机制
thanks to a unique British-born system of self regulation

622
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:03,460
它扮演着十分重要的角色 那就是同行评审
that lies at its heart - peer review.

623
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,940
坎贝尔博士是现任《自然》杂志主编
Dr Philip Campbell is the editor in chief of the journal, Nature.

624
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:18,260
同行评审保障了
And peer review is central to its reputation

625
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,780
其作为世上之一最优秀的期刊的名誉
as one of the greatest journals in the world.

626
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,820
你能简单介绍一下同行评审吗
Could you run through the peer review process,

627
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,540
具体的流程的是什么
and describe exactly how that works?

628
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:34,780
同行评审是他的同事或同行
So, peer review is an attempt by colleagues, as it were, of the authors,

629
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:39,820
验证作者实验结果是否正确的尝试
their peers, to see whether what these authors have produced looks valid.

630
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,700
同行会认真阅读论文 抽丝剥茧
He or she will look at that and really rip it to shreds,

631
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:47,180
挖掘数据 然后反馈给我们
digging into the data and then coming back to us and saying,

632
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,580
我已经认真阅读了这篇论文 我认为这篇论文没有问题
"I've really looked at this stuff and it's stood up to what I thought."

633
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,020
或者他们说这篇论文有问题
Or they'll say it doesn't.

634
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,500
那么你如何客观地评价
So, how would you assess the effects of this,

635
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,100
同行评审的作用 它达到我们要求的目的了吗
of the peer review process, just objectively? Does it do what we all want it to do?

636
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:05,980
纯粹对科学知识的评价如何保证客观
Which is be absolutely objective in a pure assessment of where our scientific knowledge is.

637
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,020
也存在一些小缺陷 我这么认为
It's full of little holes, that's how I see it.

638
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:12,100
没有任何一种方法可以排除掉所有坏文章
There are all sorts of ways in which bad papers can slip through.

639
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:16,980
他还不完美 我相信它存在某种程度上的偏见
It's not perfect and I'm sure that there are degrees of bias.

640
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,460
但我更担心
But I would feel a lot more worried

641
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,020
大量撤回我们发表的论文
if we were retracting a lot of our papers.

642
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,780
其实我们也撤回了少量论文
Actually, we retract very few of our papers.

643
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,020
我相信原因是我们发表的论文基本上是经得起考验的
I believe that's because what we publish is, by and large, robust.

644
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:32,420
我认为没有人可以比科学家更具备批判性
I really cannot think of a more critically minded group of people than scientists.

645
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:42,900
同行评审不是科学出版提供的唯一一种方式
Peer review is not the only service provided by scientific publishing.

646
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,860
因为期刊是科学界主要的一种发声形式
Because the journals are one of the key voices of the scientific community,

647
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,180
为持续的辩论提供平台
providing a forum for continued debate.

648
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:59,260
这种科学界持续的评审帮助去伪存真
This continuous interrogation by the scientific community helps sort the good science from the bad.

649
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,420
这大体上提供了科学家
Gradually, this gives way to a consensus

650
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,100
针对最近发现及其意义达成共识的方法
with scientists agreeing on the latest findings and their meaning.

651
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,500
论文并不是终结
No paper is the end of the story.

652
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,700
即使一篇论文已经登上了自然
So, even though it's got the Nature name on it,

653
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,740
在我看来 只有人们确实验证了实验结果 
from my point of view, I know that it's only when it's been out there

654
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:21,980
我们才能确信这篇文章是没有问题的
and people have really tested it and try to build on it, that we really know whether it's true.

655
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,860
全球变暖就是一个很好的例证
Global warming is a good example.

656
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,340
科学界的大部分达成共识二氧化碳
There's an overwhelming scientific consensus that carbon dioxide

657
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,620
和其他排入大气的气体正在改变气候
and other emissions into the atmosphere is changing the climate,

658
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:36,220
使全球变暖 人们是如何达成这个共识的
warming the world. So, how did that consensus develop?

659
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,580
气候系统非常复杂
The climate system is enormously complex

660
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,500
我认为没有任何一篇文章
and I don't think there is any single paper that can ever show

661
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,340
能描述清楚大气因为二氧化碳或其他温室气体
one way or another that climate warming because of carbon dioxide

662
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,820
的这种或那种变暖过程
or other greenhouse gases is occurring.

663
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,460
因此 花费了大量时间 积累了很多证据
So, it's only over a lot of time and a lot of cumulative evidence,

664
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,900
仔仔细细地检查 你才能最终确定
and a lot of critical scrutiny that you end up convinced

665
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,900
某事正在发生
that something is really happening.

666
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,420
我想说气候变化
I would so love to show that climate change isn't happening

667
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,460
并不会威胁我孙子孙女的未来
in a way that I do actually believe threatens my grandchildren's future.

668
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,100
但不幸的是
But, it's so unfortunate

669
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,980
我们似乎没有得到任何可以证明它是伪命题的文章
that we don't seem to be getting papers that show that it's wrong.

670
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,780
同行评审尝试向科学发现过程中
Peer review is an attempt to introduce

671
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:25,180
引入额外的严密审查
an additional level of rigour to the process of discovery,

672
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:29,860
让我们可以区分已验证的假设和推测
allowing us to distinguish between tested hypotheses and speculation.

673
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,580
书和期刊的不同之处在于
The difference between a book and a scientific journal

674
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:42,260
书里只是作者自己的观点
is that, in a book, you're reading an author's opinion.

675
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:47,620
世上可能没有赞成书中的内容 而且你也可能不知道
Nobody else in the world may agree with the contents of this book and you wouldn't know.

676
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,620
书只表达了个人观点
It's a statement of opinion.

677
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:54,540
虽然期刊经过了层层审核
Whereas a scientific journal has been through some level of checking,

678
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:59,940
此领域的专家仍会认真阅读 发现被人忽视的错误
experts in the field have looked at it and found that it's not obviously wrong.

679
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,660
所以说同行评审在某种意义上
So a scientific peer review journal is in a sense a snapshot

680
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:09,620
是任意时间我们对客观世界或某一特定事物的最佳理解的写照
of our best view of the world, of a particular subject, at any given time.

681
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:21,220
从牛顿的理性探讨到出版和同行评审
From Newton's rational approach, to publishing and peer review,

682
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:27,500
可以说英国对科学产生的影响是全世界最大的
Britain has arguably had a greater influence on how science is done than any other nation.

683
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:35,180
也许这种影响在法国更明显
But perhaps that legacy can be seen most clearly in France.

684
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:44,060
或是说 在法国
Or rather, UNDER France,

685
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,380
和瑞士地下
and Switzerland.

686
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:54,060
这些建筑看似毫不起眼
This rather unimpressive set of buildings

687
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:57,820
就像一所三等的省级技术院校
might look like a third-rate provincial technical college,

688
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:01,060
但里面住的可是正参加有史以来
but housed in them are scientists engaged in what is, without doubt,

689
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:06,140
最伟大实验之一的科学家
one of the most important experiments ever undertaken.

690
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:17,260
在底下大约100米 就是大型强子对撞机
Below the ground here, around 100 metres below the ground, is the Large Hadron Collider.

691
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:20,580
周长27千米
It's 27 kilometres in circumference.

692
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:25,740
它能将质子加速到光速的99.9999%
Its job is to accelerate protons to 99.9999% the speed of light,

693
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:32,140
一秒可以绕周长27千米的隧道11,000圈
at which speed they circumnavigate these 27 kilometres 11,000 times a second.

694
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:35,980
质子相互碰撞 模拟宇宙大爆炸最初的
The protons are collided together, and with each one of those collisions,

695
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,820
十亿分之一秒之内
the conditions that were present

696
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:41,740
这些碰撞发生了
less than a billionth of a second after the universe began, are recreated.

697
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,700
人类可能
The sheer audacity of it,

698
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:59,780
回到137年前探索宇宙如何形成
that human beings might be able to reach back 13.7 billion years

699
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:03,420
这种行为十分大胆 扣人心弦
to discover how the universe evolved, is breathtaking.

700
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:10,300
这里进行的实验定会载入史册
And yet, that's what's being done here on an epic scale.

701
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:21,100
大型强子对撞机是人类建造的最为复杂的实验设备
The Large Hadron Collider is the most complicated scientific experiment ever built.

702
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,460
但它仍和其他设备一样都是实验的一部分
But it's still just an experiment like any other.

703
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,900
它的核心还是可再现性
At its heart, there is repeatable process...

704
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,100
牛顿的棱镜核心也是可再现性
..as with Newton's prism.

705
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:45,820
正如卡文迪什一样
There are teams of people dedicated to making detailed measurements,

706
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,660
大量的团队都致力于做出精细测量
as Cavendish did with his flammable air.

707
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,860
LOUD BANG

708
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,820
塔特运用的严谨逻辑思考
And the same rigorously logical thought processes

709
00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:01,660
也被应用在这里
used by Bill Tutte are, of course, applied here too.

710
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:10,660
这些原则原则虽然简单 但有着极大力量
These are simple principles, yet they hold great power.

711
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:20,220
世上半数的粒子物理学家 大约10,000人
Half of the world's particle physicists, 10,000 of them,

712
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:25,860
都因潜在科学发现的吸引 聚集在这 
are gathered here because of the tantalising prospects of what they might discover.

713
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,980
欧洲核子研究组织就是未来 因为这里正经历着天翻地覆的变化
CERN is now the place to be because everything is happening here.

714
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:35,420
新物理 新材料 超对称 暗物质
New physics, new stuff, supersymmetry, dark matter.

715
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:39,340
我们正在解决的问题很重要 是世界万物的基础
So we're solving problems which are fundamental to all, all people, everywhere.

716
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:44,340
你不会在意他们来自哪里 我们都在为同一个目标努力
You don't really care where anyone comes from, we all want the same thing.

717
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,980
能成为其中一部分
And being part of this

718
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,460
简直太奇妙了
is just...brilliant.

719
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:53,260
我在干什么 我得想一想
What do I do? I'm going to have to think about that for a second...

720
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:54,740
HE CHUCKLES

721
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,380
尽管其中一两位科学家
But while one or two of them

722
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:00,180
记不住他们自己应该干什么
can't remember what they're supposed to be doing individually,

723
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,060
但作为一个集体 这的科学家们
as a group, the scientists here

724
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:05,620
已做出物理上的重大发现之一
have made one of the most important discoveries in physics.

725
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:13,220
日内瓦欧洲核子研究组织的研究人员
Researchers at the Centre for Nuclear Research near Geneva...

726
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:16,660
就在几分钟前宣布他们已经观测到
..have just announced in the last few minutes that Higgs boson,

727
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,740
被称为上帝粒子的希格斯玻色子
the so-called God particle, has been glimpsed.

728
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:26,460
2012年7月 已证实检测到一种新的粒子 希格斯玻色子 
In July 2012 it was confirmed that a new particle, the Higgs boson, had been detected.

729
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,660
亚原子拼图中的这种难捉摸的一小片
This elusive piece of the subatomic jigsaw

730
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:33,060
是宇宙万物一切质量的来源
is responsible for the masses of the building blocks of the universe.

731
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:38,260
这种粒子以英国物理学家彼得・希格斯命名
The particle is named after British physicist Peter Higgs,

732
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:41,140
希格斯早在50年前就在研究这种理论
who worked on the theory some 50 years earlier.

733
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:49,380
此项理论是CERN的构想的辩护
The discovery is a vindication of the ideas behind CERN,

734
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:54,100
我们之所以相信这项发现
but the reason that we can be confident in the discovery

735
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:58,620
是因为在实验设计中投入的心血 
is the painstaking effort that has gone into the design of the experiments.

736
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:08,300
即使资助两个研究团队 而他们却在研究同一件事情
Even to the point of funding two separate teams of researchers, analysing exactly the same things.

737
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:13,540
因为交叉核对十分重要 不允许团队讨论自己研究
A cross-check so vital that the teams are not allowed to discuss their work,

738
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,740
即使团队间讨论也不被允许
even with each other.

739
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,100
我所在的研究所就是那边几百米的
My institute in Manchester is part of an experiment

740
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,300
超环面仪器实验中的一部分
about a few hundred metres in that direction called Atlas,

741
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:29,820
它集结了来自38个国家超过160个学术机构
it's a collaboration of over 160 institutes from 38 countries,

742
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:35,500
我们一起设计 建造 运行这个实验
and together, we designed, we built and we operate that experiment.

743
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,860
如果你朝这个方向走上几英里
Now, if you go several miles in that direction,

744
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:42,820
大型强子对撞机的另一边还有另一个合作研究所
over to the other side of the LHC there's another collaboration.

745
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:46,060
也就是CMS 由另一批物理学家负责
It's called CMS and it's run by different physicists.

746
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:51,740
它的设计 建立 运行 完全独立于Atlas
It was designed, built, and it is operated completely independently from Atlas.

747
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:55,180
它们都在研究同一种物质
But they're both designed essentially to do the same thing,

748
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:58,620
也就是研究类似希格斯玻色子的物理新现象
which is to search for new physics like the Higgs boson.

749
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:05,140
由于两个团队找到了完全一样的物质
And because these two groups found exactly the same thing,

750
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:09,180
因此每个人都确信该粒子确实已经被发现了
everyone could be confident that the Higgs really had been discovered.

751
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:15,260
就是这种科学方法让CERN
It's this, the scientific method, that gives CERN

752
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:19,260
和所有的科学研究相信其拥有的力量和正确性
and all of scientific investigation its power and validity.

753
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:25,420
CERN就是现代科学的最好例证
CERN is the best example of what modern, international science has become

754
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:29,100
你会发现所有的基本科学准则
and you see all the basic principles of science

755
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:33,780
都已付诸实践 从精确观察到同行评审
put into action here, from precision observation to peer review.

756
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:39,460
英国在超过四个世纪中奉献给科学的东西
So, I suppose, CERN perfectly embodies all the things that Britain

757
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:42,540
现在都被CERN传承了下来
over four centuries has given to science.

758
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:52,260
科学就是这个国家拥有的其中一个成功故事
Science is one of this country's success stories,

759
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,820
许多知名人物都是英国人
many of its important characters are British,

760
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:59,820
英国也成为重大科学发现的摇篮
and Britain has always been a place where crucial discoveries are made.

761
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:04,660
牛顿的万有引力定律 原子结构
Newton's theory of gravity, the structure of the atom,

762
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,300
DNA分子模型
the form of the DNA molecule,

763
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:11,740
北大西洋上的这些小岛留下的所有遗产
all courtesy of a few small islands in the North Atlantic.

764
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:20,460
但是重大的科学发现都不是巧合
But these great discoveries haven't happened by accident.

765
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:29,340
皇家学会和科学研究所这样组织的存在
The existence of organisations like the Royal Society

766
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:34,500
证明了英国重视科学头脑
and the Royal Institution demonstrates that here is a place where enquiring minds are valued,

767
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:39,140
也相信看似未知的事物也值得研究
and the apparently unknowable is thought worthy of investigation.

768
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:45,020
这是一个歌颂好奇心的国家
This is also a nation that celebrates curiosity,

769
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:49,100
一旦和正确的探索自然的方法结合
and when combined with a powerful method to investigate nature,

770
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:52,180
英国科学定会
this has always ensured that British science

771
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:56,300
屹立世界之巅
is disproportionately represented amongst the world's best.

772
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:03,260
英国 仅有世界1%的人口和3%的投资
Britain, with only 1% of the world's population and 3% of the investment,

773
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:09,500
发表了将近15%的最具影响力的科学论文
produces almost 15% of the most influential scientific papers.

774
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:13,900
考虑到我们的文明就建立在科学的基础上
And given that our civilisation is built on science,

775
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:18,380
科学使我们了解自然的唯一方法
that science is the only way we have of understanding how nature works,

776
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:22,660
英国今天在世界科学中
then it seems to me that Britain's place today

777
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:25,980
占据的领先地位
as the best place in the world to do science

778
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:30,100
似乎值得庆祝 值得投入
is something that's worth cherishing, investing in,

779
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,860
值得保护
and protecting for the future.

00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:46,580
下一集 我们将走进英国重大科学发现的发生地
Next time, I'll be looking at where some of Britain's greatest discoveries came from.

781
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:53,900
当我们知道自己在寻找什么时 科学给我们带来的好处是不是更多
And asking whether we benefit more from science when we know what we looking for.

782
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:58,180
或者这些想法是不是从天而降
Or whether the best ideas come out of the blue.
