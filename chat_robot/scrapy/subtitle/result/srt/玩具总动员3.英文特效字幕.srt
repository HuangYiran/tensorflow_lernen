00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I thought we were goin' to the attic. -I hate all this uncertainty!

109
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Wait a minute. Quiet!

110
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one's getting thrown out, okay? We're all still here.

111
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, yeah, we've lost friends along the way.

112
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Wheezy and Etch and... -Bo Peep?

113
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Even Bo.

114
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All good toys who've gone on to new owners.

115
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But through every yard sale, every spring cleaning, Andy held on to us!

116
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He must care about us, or we wouldn't be here.

117
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in the attic. It'll be safe and warm...

118
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And we'll all be together. -Exactly!

119
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's games up there, and books, and...

120
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-The racecar track! -The racecar track. Thank you!

121
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And the old TV. -There you go, the old TV.

122
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And those guys from the Christmas decorations box. They're fun, right?

123
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

124
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And someday, if we're lucky, Andy may have kids of his own.

125
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he'll play with us then, right?

126
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll always be there for him.

127
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, guys. Let's get our parts together, get ready,

128
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and go out on a high note.

129
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I 'd better find my other eye.

130
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where'd you leave it this time?

131
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someplace dark. And dusty.

132
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Let's see how much we're going for on eBay.

133
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry. Andy's gonna take care of us. I guarantee it!

134
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guarantee it, huh?

135
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, Buzz. What else could I say?

136
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, whatever happens, at least we'll all be together.

137
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For infinity and beyond.

138
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Can I have your stereo? -No.

139
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why not? -'Cause I 'm taking it with me.

140
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Can I have your computer? -No.

141
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Your video games? -Forget it, Molly.

142
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Andy, let's get to work here.

143
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything you're not taking to college either goes in the attic, or it's trash.

144
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Mom, I 'm not leaving till Friday. -Come on. It's garbage day.

145
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Mom. -Look, it's simple.

146
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Skateboard, college. Little League trophy, probably attic.

147
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple core, trash. You can do the rest.

148
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you still have these toys?

149
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Molly, out of my room!

150
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three more days and it's mine!

151
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Molly, you're not off the hook either.

152
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have more toys than you know what to do with.

153
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some of them could make other kids really happy.

154
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kids?

155
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The children at the daycare. They're always asking for donations.

156
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's daycare?

157
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Mom. -No buts.

158
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You choose the toys you want to donate, I 'll drop them off at Sunnyside.

159
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Poor Barbie.

160
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get the Corvette.

161
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andy, come on. You need to start making decisions.

162
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like what?

163
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like what are you gonna do with these toys?

164
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Should we donate them to Sunnyside?

165
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No. -Maybe sell them online?

166
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, no one's gonna want those old toys.

167
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're junk.

168
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. You have till Friday.

169
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything that's not packed for college or in the attic

170
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-is getting thrown out. -Whatever you say, Mom.

171
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What's happening? -We're getting thrown out, you idiot.

172
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what's happening.

173
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You need a hand? -I got it.

174
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here.

175
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you gonna miss me when I 'm gone?

176
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-If I say no, do I still get your room? -Nope.

177
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then, yes, I 'll miss you.

178
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't breathe!

179
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-This can't be happening! -Quiet! What's that sound?

180
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andy!

181
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not trash. That's not trash!

182
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think, think, Woody. Think, think, think.

183
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buster! Come here, boy! Come here!

184
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, boy. To the curb!

185
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Buster! No!

186
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get up. Buster!

187
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We're on the curb! -I knew it would come to this!

188
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pull, everyone! Pull!

189
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It won't rip! -Forget it!

190
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's triple-ply, high-density polyethylene!

191
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's gotta be a way out!

192
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andy doesn't want us. What's the point?

193
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Point. Point. Point!

194
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Push! Push!

195
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can hear the garbage truck!

196
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's getting closer.

197
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz! Jessie!

198
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Andy threw us out. -Like we were garbage.

199
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Junk. He called us junk. -How could he?

200
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This doesn't make any sense.

201
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should have seen this coming. It's Emily all over again.

202
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sarge was right. -Yeah, and Woody was wrong.

203
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute. Wait, hold on. This is no time to be hysterical.

204
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the perfect time to be hysterical.

205
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Should we be hysterical? -No!

206
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yes! -Maybe! But not right now!

207
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fellas, I know what to do.

208
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the heck?

209
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We should 've done this years ago. -Jessie, wait. What about Woody?

210
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's fine, Buzz. Andy's taking him to college.

211
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now we need to go!

212
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right. Come on.

213
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Buzz? -Woody!

214
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on? Don't you know this box is being donated?

215
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's under control, Woody. We have a plan.

216
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going to daycare!

217
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daycare? What, have you all lost your marbles?

218
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, didn't you see? Andy threw us away.

219
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, no. He was putting you in the attic.

220
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Attic? So how did we end up on the curb?

221
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was a mistake. Andy's mom thought you were trash.

222
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. After he put us in a trash bag.

223
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And called us junk!

224
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I know. It looks bad. But, guys, you gotta believe me.

225
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure thing, college boy!

226
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andy's moving on, Woody. It's time we did the same.

227
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Out of the box. Everyone, right now!

228
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Buzz. Give me a hand. We gotta get this thing outta here.

229
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woody, wait. We need to figure out what's best for everyone.

230
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. Great! It's gonna take us forever to get back here.

231
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all right, Barbie. You'll be okay.

232
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:44,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Molly and I have been growing apart for years.

233
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just... I can't believe she would throw me away!

234
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Welcome to the club, toots. -Okay, everyone, listen up.

235
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can get back to Andy's, but we gotta move fast.

236
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll hide under the seats till we get back home.

237
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get it through your vinyl noggin, Woody.

238
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andy doesn't want us anymore.

239
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was putting you in the attic!

240
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He left us on the curb!

241
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-All right, calm down! Both of you! -Okay, fine. Fine.

242
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just wait till you see what daycare's like.

243
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why? What's it like? -Daycare is a sad, lonely place

244
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for washed-up old toys who have no owners.

245
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Quite the charmer, aren't ya? -You'll see.

246
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As soon as we get to daycare, you'll be begging to go home.

247
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,910


248
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can anyone see anything?

249
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-There's a playground! -Wow!

250
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We hit the jackpot, Bullseye!

251
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So much for sad and lonely, huh?

252
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Calm down, guys. Let's just keep this in perspective.

253
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perspective? This place is perfect.

254
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woody, it's nice! See? The door has a rainbow on it.

255
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hey there! -Wow!

256
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Haven't seen you in ages.

257
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted to drop these old toys off.

258
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Is this Bonnie? -Look how big you are.

259
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Say hi, sweetie. -Hi.

260
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, how are your kids? Molly and Andy?

261
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not kids anymore. Andy's going to college on Friday.

262
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What? -Can you believe it?

263
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You sure they won't miss these? -No, they never get played with.

264
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You see any kids? -Where is she taking us?

265
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Look! -Wow!

266
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? What is it?

267
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no.

268
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the matter with you?

269
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't see!

270
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, everyone. Recess. Come on!

271
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-So now what do we do? -We go back to Andy's.

272
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Anyone see an exit? -Exit, shmexit. Let's get played with.

273
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Careful. These toys might be jealous of new arrivals.

274
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I want to see! -Hey!

275
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Rex! -It's my turn!

276
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}New toys!

277

279
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,070

285
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,940

286
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First thing you gotta know about me, I 'm a hugger.

287
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at you all. You've been through a lot today, haven't ya?

288
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been horrible.

289
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you're safe now. We're all castoffs here.

290
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We been dumped, donated, yard-saled, secondhanded

291
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and just plain thrown out. But just you wait,

292
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you'll find being donated was the best thing that ever happened to ya.

293
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Lotso, do toys here get played with every day?

294
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All day long. Five days a week.

295
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what happens when the kids grow up?

296
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, now, I 'll tell ya.

297
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When the kids get old, new ones come in.

298
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When they get old, new ones replace them.

299
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll never be outgrown or neglected, never abandoned or forgotten.

300
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No owners means no heartbreak.

301
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It's a miracle. -And you wanted us to stay at Andy's.

302
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because we're Andy's toys!

303
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you got donated by this Andy, huh?

304
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's his loss, Sheriff. He can't hurt you no more.

305
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Whoa, whoa, no, no, no... -Now, let's get you all settled in.

306
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ken? Where is that boy? Ken? New toys!

307
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Far out! Down in a jiff, Lotso.

308
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour?

309
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's show our new friends where they'll be staying.

310
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Folks, if you want to step right this way...

311
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, I 'm Ken.

312
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Barbie. Have we ever met?

313
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would 've remembered.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Abandoned by the same owner.

369
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sounds like kids to me.

370

372
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They sound so sweet.

373

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, everyone, it's nice here, I admit.

374
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we need to go home.

375
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,390

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A chance to make kids happy again.

377
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why don't you stay? -Yeah, Woody. Stay with us.

380
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You can make a new kid happy. -No, no. Guys, really. No!

381
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a kid. You have a kid. Andy!

382
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if he wants us at college, or in the attic,

383
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}well, then, our job is to be there for him.

384
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I 'm going home.

385
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone who wants to join me is welcome. Come on, Buzz.

386
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz?

387
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our mission with Andy is complete, Woody.

388
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

389
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what's important now is we stay together.

390
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:28,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We wouldn't even be together if it weren't for Andy!

391
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look under your boot, Buzz. You, too, Jessie.

392
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whose name is written there?

393
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe Andy doesn't care about us anymore.

394
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:39,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course he does. He cares about all of you!

395
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was putting you in the attic. I saw.

396
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't just turn your back on him now!

397
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:47,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woody, wake up! It's over! Andy is all grown up!

398
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, fine. Perfect.

399
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe how selfish you all are.

400
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:05,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So this is it? After all we've been through.

401
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bullseye, no. You need to stay.

402
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bullseye, no, I said, "Stay!"

403
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look,

404
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:38,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want you left alone in the attic, okay? Now, stay.

405
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bonnie?

406
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta go.

407
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bonnie, you in here?

408
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Come on. Oh, no, no.

409
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What... What the heck?

410
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, that's better.

411
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Bonnie! -Bluebells, cockleshells...

412

413
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, no!

414
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Reach for the sky!

415
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bluebells, cockleshells. Eenie, miny...

416

00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that space guy, he could be useful.

532
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:37,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He ain't the sharpest knife in the place where they keep the knives.

533
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neither are you, Chunk.

538
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I 'm not a girl's toy! I 'm not! Why do you guys keep saying that?

539
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All them toys are disposable.

551
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who's "Yid-nuh"? -I believe it's pronounced "Yid-nay."

557
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I 'll fire up the computer.

558
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unhand me, you cowards! I demand to talk to Lotso!

559

561
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:31,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ken? What's goin' on here? Why is this toy tied up?

562
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He got out, Lotso.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Got out"? No, no, no, no, no. This isn't how we treat our guests.

564
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:44,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}F-A-oh, my Schwarz. There you go. I 'm so sorry.

565
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Lotso, there's been a mistake. -A mistake?

566
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The children in the Caterpillar Room are not age-appropriate

567
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for me and my friends.

568
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:53,550

571
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:01,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This toy's shown initiative, leadership.

572
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, I 'd say we've found ourselves a keeper.

573
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper!

574
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're calling you up to the big leagues, son.

575
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:15,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From now on, you'll have anything you want.

576
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excellent. I 'll go get my friends.

577
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss.

578
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those Caterpillar kids need someone to play with.

579
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But my friends don't belong there.

580
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}None of us do, I agree.

581
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which is why, for the good of our community,

582
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we ask the newer toys, the stronger ones,

583
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to take on the hardships the rest of us can't bear anymore.

584
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I guess that makes sense.

585
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I can't accept. We're a family. We stay together.

586
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Family man, huh? I understand.

587
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put him back in the timeout chair.

588
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are ya... Unhand me!

590
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here it is.

591

00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I 'll see what it was.

604
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you see? Anything?

605
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:49,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, just a dark hallway and... Wait. Wait!

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, I really see him. In his room.

609
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My other eye! The one I left behind.

00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this is so weird. He's packing up.

611
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:11,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here comes Buster. Out of the way! Get away!

00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's looking in the attic.

614
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, there's Mom. Why is he so upset?

615
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible!

659
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,360

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think this potato needs to learn himself some manners.

665
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,630

675
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,740

676
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, yes, sir! Prisoners sleep in their cells.

677
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any prisoner caught outside their cell spends the night in the box.

678
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roll call at dusk and dawn.

679
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any prisoner misses roll call, spends the night in the box.

680
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:27,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prisoners do not speak unless spoken to.

681
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any prisoner talks back, spends the night...

682
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the box! We get it.

683
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At ease, soldier. They're neutralized.

00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But remember, they'll say anything to make you doubt yourself.

685
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, Commander.

686
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any doubt I had got pounded out of me at the academy.

688
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got a way of doin' things here at Sunnyside.

689
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:51,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you start at the bottom, pay your dues,

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's just a dinosaur toy down the street.

699
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's nothing. Let me just take care of that.

700

710
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:05,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean "escape"?

711
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:10,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sunnyside is a place of ruin and despair.

712
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ruled by an evil bear who smells of strawberries.

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But... How do you know that?

717
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:26,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chuckles. He'll tell you.

718
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:33,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I knew Lotso.

719
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was a good toy. A friend.

720
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:42,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me and him, we had the same kid, Daisy.

721
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A was there when Lotso got unwrapped.

722
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daisy loved us all.

00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:52,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Lotso,

00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lotso was special.

00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One day, we took a drive.

728
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:10,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime.

729
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:13,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After lunch, Daisy fell asleep.

730
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:23,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She never came back.

731
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lotso wouldn't give up.

732
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:38,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It took forever, but we finally made it back to Daisy's.

733
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But by then, it was too late.

734
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:02,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something changed that day inside Lotso.

735
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:04,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something snapped.

736
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She replaced us. Come on!

737
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No, she only replaced you! -She replaced all of us.

738
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:11,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't she?

739
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She don't love you no more!

740
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now come on!

741
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:29,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were lost. Cast off. Unloved. Unwanted.

742
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then we found Sunnyside.

743
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Lotso wasn't my friend anymore.

744
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wasn't anyone's friend.

745
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:59,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He took over Sunnyside and rigged the whole system.

746
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how'd you get out?

747
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got broke. Bonnie found me, took me home.

748
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Other toys, they weren't so lucky.

749
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It ain't right what Lotso done. New toys,

750
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they don't stand a chance.

751
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-But my friends are in there. -You can't go back.

752
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Returning now would be suicide!

753
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what about your Andy?

754
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't he leaving for college?

755
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off!

756
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Bullseye. I miss Woody, too.

757
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he ain't ever comin' back.

758
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,800


759
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rise and shine, campers!

760
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Commander Lotso, sir!

761
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:25,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All quiet, nothing to report.

762
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:28,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excellent, Lightyear. Come on. We need ya back at Star Command.

763
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! What've you done with my husband?

764
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big Baby.

765
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetheart!

766
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:45,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was cold and dark. Nothing but sand and a couple of Lincoln Logs.

767
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:47,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think those were Lincoln Logs.

768
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You all get ready. You got a play-date with destiny!

769
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:14,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

770
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:16,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You shouldn't have come back, cowboy.

771
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:21,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they've cracked down hard since you left. More guards, more patrols.

772
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:23,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and your friends ain't ever getting out of here now.

773
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I made it out once.

774
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:27,610

775
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:30,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep your heads down. You'll survive.

776
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, for how long?

777

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they'll never break me.

779
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:38,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's only one way toys leave this place.

780
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:42,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn.

781
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then it's off to the dump.

782
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I appreciate your concern, old-timer.

783
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we have a kid waiting for us. Now, we're leaving.

784
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you'd help us, one toy to another, I 'd sure be grateful.

785
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if you're gonna get out,

786
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}first thing you gotta get through's the doors.

787
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Locked, every night. Inside and out. Keys are left on a hook in the office.

788
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:05,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got it. What else?

789
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lotso has trucks patrolling all night long.

790
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hallway, lobby, playground.

791
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:11,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, yeah, yeah. What about the wall?

792
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eight-feet high. Cinder block. No way through it.

793
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You go over or under.

794
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:18,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it? Doesn't seem so bad.

795
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:21,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not. Your real problem's the monkey.

796
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The monkey's the eye in the sky.

797
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He sees everything.

798
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Classrooms.

799
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hallways.

800
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even the playground.

801
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can unlock doors, sneak past guards, climb the wall,

802
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:07,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but if you don't take out that monkey, you ain't going nowhere.

803
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,260

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lotso did something to him!

812
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:39,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He thinks he's a real Space Ranger again.

813

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong.

817

868
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this is where the magic happens.

869
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,290

875
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:33,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one appreciates clothes here, Barbie. No one.

876
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:38,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ken, would you model a few outfits for me?

877
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a few?

878
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,140

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amigos! We're all amigos.

944
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,470


945
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,270


946
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:58,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta switch him back.

947
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:01,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Well, how do we do that? -I don't know. That part's in Spanish.

948
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't have time for this. Come on, El Buzzo.

949
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:06,030


950
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:07,000


951
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:09,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck, cowboy.

952
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:17,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here they come.

953
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:21,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Buzz!

954
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What took you so long?

955
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Things got complicated. Where's Potato Head?

956
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We haven't seen him.

957
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz.

958
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:35,900


959
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:39,900


960
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:42,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you fix Buzz?

961
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:44,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sort of. -Behind you.

962
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone's coming.

963
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You would not believe what I 've been through tonight.

964
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:54,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Darling! Are you okay?

965
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:57,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel fresh. Healthy. It's terrible.

966
01:08:57,130 --> 01:09:00,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've lost weight. And so tall.

967
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:04,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a sight for detachable eyes.

968
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:10,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All clear.

969
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Come on.

970
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:19,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're almost there.

971
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:25,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back up. Back up!

972
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

973
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:42,000


974
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:45,330


975
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:48,000


976
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woody!

977
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:56,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. We're almost there.

978
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,400


979
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:07,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz, come here. Give me a lift.

980
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,500


981
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:19,560


982
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:21,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Way to go, Buzz. Come on.

983
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:28,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Is it safe? -I guess I 'll find out.

984
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:37,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Woody? You okay? -Yeah.

985
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:40,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on down. But not all at once.

986
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:42,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What did he say? -I think he said, "All at once."

987
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No. No, no, no, no, no!

988
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:45,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Geronimo! -Look out!

989
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:49,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, Jess.

990
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:51,620


991
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Almost there, guys.

992
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:55,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slink, you think you can make it?

993
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:58,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I might be old, but I still got a spring in my step.

994
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He did it! -All right, Slinkykins.

995
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, climb across.

996
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:09,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You lost, little doggie?

997
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, well. Look who's back.

998
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:25,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, cowboy.

999
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They broke me.

1000
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:31,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are y'all doing? Running back to your kid?

1001
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He don't want you no more.

1002
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That's a lie. -Is it?

1003
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me this, Sheriff.

1004
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:40,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If your kid loves you so much, why is he leaving?

1005
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think you're special, cowboy?

1006
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:47,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a piece of plastic. You were made to be thrown away.

1007
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:50,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Speak of the devil.

1008
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:59,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, we need toys in our Caterpillar Room

1009
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:02,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you need to avoid that truck.

1010
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:06,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you come on back, join our family again?

1011
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:10,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't a family! It's a prison! You're a liar and a bully!

1012
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:14,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I 'd rather rot in this dumpster than join any family of yours!

1013
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:18,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jessie's right! Authority should derive from the consent of the governed,

1014
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:19,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not from the threat of force.

1015
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:22,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If that's what you want.

1016
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:27,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Barbie! Wait! Don't do this, Lotso.

1017
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:32,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's a Barbie doll, Ken. There's a hundred million just like her.

1018
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:34,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not to me, there's not.

1019
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:38,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. Then why don't you join her!

1020
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:42,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Ken!

1021
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone, listen!

1022
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:47,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sunnyside could be cool and groovy if we treated each other fair.

1023
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:50,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Lotso. He's made us into a pyramid,

1024
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he put himself on top!

1025
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone concur with Ken?

1026
01:13:57,890 --> 01:14:00,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't throw you away. Your kid did.

1027
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:03,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really.

1028
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:05,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chew on that when you're at the dump.

1029
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:07,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! What about Daisy?

1030
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what you're talking about.

1031
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daisy? You used to do everything with her?

1032
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:16,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah? Then she threw us out. -No.

1033
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:18,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-She lost you. -She replaced us!

1034
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:20,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She replaced you.

1035
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:22,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if you couldn't have her then no one could.

1036
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You lied to Big Baby and you've been lying ever since.

1037
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:29,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Where'd you get that? -She loved you, Lotso.

1038
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She never loved me.

1039
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:32,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As much as any kid ever loved a toy.

1040
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:37,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mama.

1041
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:40,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? You want your mommy back?

1042
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:44,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She never loved you. Don't be such a baby!

1043
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:48,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Push 'em in. All of 'em!

1044
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:52,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is what happens when you dummies try to think.

1045
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:57,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're all just trash, waiting to be thrown away! That's all a toy is!

1046
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:01,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot!

1047
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:06,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No! Wait a minute! Big Baby, wait!

1048
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:11,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He's gone! -Holy cow.

1049
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Hurry!

1050
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For crying out loud!

1051
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:26,960


1052
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woody!

1053
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:37,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, boy. Incoming!

01:30:21,790 --> 01:30:26,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but he's also one of the most dastardly villains of all time, evil Dr. Pork Chop.

1207
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These little dudes are from a strange alien world.

1215
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:04,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They mean a lot to me.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-"There's a snake in my boot." -Wha?

1221
01:31:45,370 --> 01:31:47,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's brave, like a cowboy should be.

1222
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:49,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And kind. And smart.

01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:56,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the thing that makes Woody special is he'll never give up on you.

01:36:51,930 --> 01:36:54,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, she really got your smile.

1265
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the...

1266
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:07,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you kids! Stay out of my butt!

1267
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:12,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?

1268
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:15,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Romeo, o Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?

1269
01:37:16,490 --> 01:37:18,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next season, we're doing Cats.

1270
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:21,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or might I suggest Hamlet?

1271
01:37:22,330 --> 01:37:25,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Detached wing. Cosmetic damage.

1272
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:27,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing a little duct tape can't fix.

1273
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:40,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what came over me.

1274
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:44,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just go with it, Buzz.
