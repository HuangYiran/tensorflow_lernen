我們將一視同仁

在亞丁灣港口加油時遭到襲擊
while refueling in the port of Aden.

20
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,570
這是恐怖主義行動
This was an act of terrorism.

21
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,420
這是可鄙懦弱的行動
It was a despicable and cowardly act.

22
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,350
下面為您演奏的

整個事件就發生在我的眼前
It was right in front of my eyes,

26
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,680
而我絲毫沒預料到
and I never saw it coming.

27
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,000
該飛機撞向了世貿中心

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,660
你現在成了自己國家的敵人

我要把你放回伊朗

為我做事

中央情報局恐怖爆炸事件的策劃者
The man who financed the bombing of the CIA.

57
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,710
我們已經談過
We talked about this.

58
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,370
你得摒棄你那套冷戰時期的狗屁理論
The need to wean you of your cold war bullshit.

59
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,980
這是可以扭轉一切的行動
This is a once in a lifetime operation

60
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,310
一輩子就這么一次機會
that can transform everything.

61
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,270
扭轉中東的整個局勢
The entire Middle East.

62
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,700
你說得像嗑藥嗑多了似的
You sound like you're fucking high.

63
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,890
你走之前我得問你件事
I need to know something before you leave.

64
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,810
我必須知道
I need to know...

65
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,730
炸彈是誰放的
Who's responsible for the bomb?

66
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,910
你知道他問了我什么
You know what he asked me?

67
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,600
誰轉移了炸彈
Who moved the bomb?

68
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,280
如果是布洛迪干的
If it was Brody.

69
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,060
那他為什么那樣問我
Now, why would he ask me that?

70
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,720
那似乎在暗示
That implies that there's a difference

71
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,530
該問題存在分歧
of opinion on that subject.

72
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,680
你應該知道是這個人
You should know that the man

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,930
放了炸彈  移動了那臺越野車
who built the bomb and moved the SUV,

74
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,160
他并沒有像他們說的那樣死于爆炸
He didn't die in the explosion like they say.

75
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,340
據我所知  他還在美國
As far as I know, he's still in this country.

76
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,190
什么地方
Where?

77
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,090
我不知道
I don't know.

78
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,070
誰知道
Who does?

79
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,070
就是促成我們會面的人
The man that brought us together.

80
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,320
是你的律師  是本尼特嗎
Your lawyer? Bennett?

81
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,810
你怎么這么殷勤  我都開始擔心了
What happened to you? I started to get worried.

82
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,300
好久沒機會表現  都生疏了
I'm out of practice.

83
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,130
看著就很好吃  索爾
This looks delicious, Saul.

84
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,230
謝謝
Thank you.

85
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,280
我給你倒杯茶吧
Can I pour you a cup of tea?

86
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,640
好
Please.

87
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,020
你哪里弄到的
Where did you get these from?

88
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,580
這不就是我們
Aren't these the mugs

89
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,470
從菲律賓帶回的杯子嗎
we brought back from the Philippines?

90
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,920
最后的一對
The very last pair.

91
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,400
等事情徹底了結
When this is all over,

92
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,990
我想再回蘇祿海上那座小島
I'd like to go back to that island on the Sulu Sea.

93
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,490
你不必有什么承諾
You know, you don't have to promise anything.

94
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,350
真的  我都明白
Really. I understand.

95
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,150
干嘛不呢
No, I don't see why not.

96
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,530
我們可以開開心心
We might actually have fun.

97
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,720
好吧  畢竟看目前情況
Well, the evidence does seem to indicate

98
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,750
確實有可能成行
that that is possible after all.

99
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,440
你今天可以
Is there any chance

100
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,950
在家待著嗎
that you could stay home today?

101
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,630
求之不得
There's nothing I'd rather do.

102
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,020
不過
But?

103
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,490
不過早晨得去趟白宮
I got a meeting with Mike Higgins

104
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,290
我和麥克·希金斯有個會
this morning at the white house.

105
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,860
-幾點  -九點半
- When? - 9:30.

106
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,880
那我看咱們還有
Well, that gives us an hour and a half...

107
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,220
一個半小時
by my count.

108
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,820
那當然
Yes, it does.

109
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,190
這兒有點問題
Okay, here's something.

110
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,020
馬克西米利安·阿齊茲博士  約旦人
Dr. Maximillian Aziz, Jordanian,

111
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,790
爆炸發生時曾在會場
was actually in the auditorium the time the bomb went off.

112
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,580
外勤還是內勤
Ops or intelligence?

113
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,380
內勤  分析跨國事務
Intelligence-- office of transnational issues.

114
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,550
和利蘭·本尼特什么關系
And what's his connection to Leland Bennett?

115
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,830
他搞了個長篇大論
He wrote a lengthy analysis

116
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,690
研究他們公司背后那些小客戶
of the firm's hip-pocket clients.

117
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,760
伊朗  敘利亞  阿塞拜疆的
Iran, Syria, Azerbaijan.

118
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,390
不過是兩年前
This was two years ago.

119
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,130
基本不符合條件啊
It hardly fits the profile.

120
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,940
受過訓嗎  有沒有爆破經歷
Any munitions training? Experience with explosives?

121
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,460
沒有
Uh... No.

122
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,360
好吧  先加進名單里
All right, add him to the list anyway.

123
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,720
行吧  但我還是想問問
Yeah, which begs the question--

124
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,400
真能確定是那炸彈客挪了布洛迪的車嗎
are we even sure that the guy who made the bomb moved Brody's car?

125
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,450
-看怎么講了  -怎么講
- Depends. - On what?

126
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,180
得看你信不信賈瓦迪
On whether or not you believe Javadi.

127
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,770
反正你信
Which you do.

128
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,020
我是信  但是光憑想當然
Which I do. But it takes more than an opinion

129
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,680
可沒法向索爾交待
to put it in front of Saul.

130
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,790
沒錯
Right.

131
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,580
但我總覺得咱這是在撞大運
You know, I can't help but feel we're spinning our wheels here.

132
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,520
這材料都快被調查局翻爛了
The FBI have been through these files a hundred times.

133
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,980
那天在總部的每一個人
Anybody that was at Langley that day

134
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,600
都被從頭到腳查了一遍
has been turned inside-out and upside-down.

135
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,100
是  但那場爆炸肯定是現場某人搞的
Yeah, well, someone who was at Langley that day did the bombing.

136
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,460
我還是接受不了他們都死掉了
I still can't believe all these people are gone.

137
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,770
我也是
Yeah.

138
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,560
法拉哪兒去了
Where's Fara anyway?

139
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,680
她一個多小時前就該過來
She was supposed to be here over an hour ago.

140
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,450
{\an8}機密

141
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,000
請進  索爾
Come on in, Saul. 

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,890
你好麥克  見到你很高興
Hey, Mike. Good to see you.

143
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,950
參議員
Senator?

144
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,590
好吧
Yeah.

145
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,630
參議員的控訴相當嚴厲
The senator's made some serious allegations.

146
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,810
具體是
Which are?

147
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,450
說你把賈瓦迪藏進我們本土的安全屋
That you had Majid Javadi in a safe house, on American soil

148
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,690
還送他出境
and let him go.

149
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,030
這是真的嗎
Do you contest that?

150
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,150
也是  也不是
Yes and no.

151
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,930
是怎么講
What's the yes?

152
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,540
我根本不知曉有任何
I'm not aware of any standing order

153
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,350
逮捕賈瓦迪上校的指令
to arrest Colonel Javadi.

154
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,910
-那你羈押他沒有  -羈押了
- Did you have him in custody or not? - I did.

155
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,820
我操他媽的  索爾
Aw, Jesus fucking Christ, Saul.

156
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,560
我們不光是送他走  麥克
We didn't just "Let him go," Mike.

157
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,040
還盤問了他
We debriefed him.

158
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,620
策反了他
Turned him.

159
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,460
才把他送回德黑蘭
Sent him back to Iran.

160
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,900
策反了他
You turned him?

161
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,240
他是我們的人了
He's ours.

162
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,630
沒法保證他會真的合作
With no guarantee that he'll actually cooperate.

163
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,200
他會的
He will.

164
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,450
你怎么知道
How do you know?

165
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,930
因為我了解他
Because I know the man.

166
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,500
因為他知道游戲規則
Because he knows the game.

167
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,590
這完全是一廂情愿
That is total speculation.

168
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,840
他說得對
He's right.

169
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,890
最近這個部門的工作
We haven't had a whole lot of success

170
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,060
基本沒什么成果
in that department lately. 

171
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,870
現在有了  賈瓦迪是中情局史上
Well, we have now. Javadi's the highest placed CIA asset

172
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,150
最有價值的線人
in the history of the agency.

173
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,300
他指揮了總部爆炸案  還提供資金
He ordered and financed the attack on Langley.

174
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,380
那再好不過了  沒人會懷疑他
All the better if he did. He's above suspicion.

175
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,420
公開的抓捕會給伊斯蘭領袖們
A high-profile arrest would've sent a clear message

176
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,560
一個明確的信息
to the mullahs.

177
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,350
都他媽歇菜
Back the fuck down.

178
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,540
但有了線人能讓我們了解
Instead we have a live source, keeping us current

179
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,120
伊朗核武器的最新進展
on Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon,

180
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,570
還有全球真主黨的行動
on hezbollah operations all over the globe.

181
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,400
這事我怎么毫不知情
How come I never saw a finding on this?

182
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,080
我們在現場對事件做出反應
We were responding to events on the ground.

183
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,870
必須當場做出決定
The call had to be made in real time.

184
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,650
他心知肚明  這就是鬼扯
That is horseshit, and he knows it.

185
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,540
邁克  該把參議員請走了
Mike, I think it's time you excuse the senator.

186
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,780
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

187
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,200
我是來向幕僚長
I called this meeting to brief

188
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,200
匯報任務第二階段的計劃
the chief of staff on the second phase of the mission.

189
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,870
那你說啊
So, go ahead.

190
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,080
不行  你在場我不能說
I can't. Not with you present. 

191
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,760
為什么
Why not?

192
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,850
因為你的密級比"行動級"還低一個等級
Because your security clearance is one level below operational.

193
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,360
你看到他這幅德行了吧
You see what I'm dealing with?

194
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,480
這人根本不服管  失去控制了
The man is out of hand and out of control.

195
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,860
這件事他是對的
And in this case, he's correct.

196
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,130
抱歉  參議員
I'm sorry, senator.

197
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,670
邁克  還有九天
Mike, in nine days,

198
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,310
我就要做局長了
I'm the next DCI.

199
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,210
所以九天后  索爾就會告訴你
And in nine days, Saul will brief you

200
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,740
你需要知道的一切
on whatever you need to know.

201
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,940
但在那之前不行
But not until then. 

202
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,380
-邁克  -參議員
- Mike... - Senator.

203
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,190
-邁克  -參議員  請離開
- Mike? - Senator, please.

204
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,630
該死的  索爾
Goddamn it, Saul.

205
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,970
過去一個半月
I spent the last month and a half 

206
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,130
我都在給你倆牽線搭橋
arranging a marriage between you two.

207
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,920
我出局了  我知道
I'm out, I know that.

208
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,230
現在成定局了
You are now.

209
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,120
本來不必如此的
You didn't need to be.

210
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,810
為了賈瓦迪  也值了
Javadi was worth it.

211
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,790
算了  跟我說第二階段的計劃吧
All right, tell me about this phase two.

212
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,340
政權更迭嗎
Regime change?

213
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,570
這是最后
Eventually.

214
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,050
我們還在準備
We're setting the stage.

215
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,710
怎么做
How?

216
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,750
首先我們讓賈瓦迪在軍方提升為
First we move Javadi up the chain of command

217
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,080
高級將領
into a senior military position.

218
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,450
怎么做到
How?!

219
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,670
繼續看
Keep reading.

220
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,470
抱歉我遲到了
Sorry I'm late.

221
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,740
路上堵車
Traffic.

222
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,920
我給你點了杯瑪奇朵  但估計都涼了
I ordered you a macchiato, but it's probably cold by now.

223
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,650
謝謝
Thank you.

224
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,900
沒關系
It's fine.

225
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,450
我收到你短信了
So I got your text.

226
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,180
一切都好嗎
Everything okay?

227
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,200
都好
Yes.

228
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,860
不好
No.

229
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,230
是...索爾
It's... Saul.

230
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,710
他怎么了
What about him?

231
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,930
我們做了個決定
We've made a decision.

232
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,920
是我做了個決定
Well, I-I've made a decision.

233
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,440
再給我們的婚姻一次機會
To give the marriage another chance.

234
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,490
我...
I...

235
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,900
要知道  做出這決定我也不容易
You have to know, it's not easy for me.

236
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,060
那你是什么時候決定的
And when, uh, did you decide all this?

237
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,660
昨晚
Last night.

238
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,060
恕我直言  我們昨天還在麗思卡爾頓酒店的套房里
Forgive me, but didn't we just spend yesterday

239
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,910
翻云覆雨
in a suite at the Ritz Carlton?

240
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,750
這是怎么回事
What's changed?

241
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,220
我剛跟你說了
I-I just told you.

242
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,530
怎么  你和索爾突然
What, suddenly Saul and you

243
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,200
決定和好了嗎
have decided to reconcile?

244
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,750
不是事發突然
It's not suddenly.

245
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,330
過去兩個月我們一直在談這事
We've been talking about it for the last two months.

246
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,560
你懂的
You know that.

247
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,950
我之前還以為
Well, I was under the impression

248
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,630
你已經放棄了
That you had given up on that.

249
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,100
你們都放棄了
That you both had.

250
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,190
我也不清楚  也許吧
Well, I don't know, maybe we had.

251
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,080
那你有什么瞞著我
Then there's something you're not telling me.

252
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,090
我和索爾做夫妻都35年了
We've been married 35 years.

253
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,270
我愛你
I love you.

254
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,720
別那樣說
Don't say that.

255
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,440
我很享受和你做愛的感覺
I love making love to you.

256
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,880
-我得走了  -米拉
- I have to go.  -Mira...

257
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,460
再見
Good-bye.

258
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,000
他簽了嗎
He signed off?

259
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,520
這么說吧
Well, let's put it this way--

260
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,570
他認為該行動計劃有可取之處
He sees the merits of the operation.

261
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,890
所以他要讓總統過目
So he's taking it to the President?

262
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,660
-是的  -可取之處
- Yes.  -Merits?

263
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,980
索爾  你他媽是個天才
Saul, it's fucking genius.

264
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,240
還得看能不能落實
If we can pull it off.

265
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,040
你什么時候出發
When are you leaving?

266
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,160
明天早上
Tomorrow morning.

267
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,730
卡莉知道你要出發嗎
Does Carrie know you're going?

268
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,880
她根本猜不到
She can't even suspect it.

269
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,550
你們找我嗎
Heard you were looking for me.

270
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,770
剛剛在看你和賈瓦迪的談話筆錄
Yeah, we were just going over the transcript of your debrief 

271
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,300
看看是否與
with Javadi to see if it supported

272
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,280
昨天他對卡莉敘述的內容相符
what he told Carrie on the tarmac yesterday.

273
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,920
結果呢
Which was?

274
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,020
當時移動越野車的嫌犯
That the man who moved the SUV

275
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,350
仍身處在國內
is still in the United States,

276
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,660
并且他和利蘭·本尼特的律所有聯系
And he's somehow connected to Leland Bennett's law firm.

277
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,540
什么聯系
Connected how? 

278
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,210
還不清楚
It's unclear.

279
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,390
所以希望你可以指點迷津
We were hoping you could shed some light.

280
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,200
賈瓦迪從未談及與本尼特的關系
Javadi didn't mention the Bennett connection.

281
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,130
那布洛迪呢
Well, what about Brody?

282
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,250
他提及過布洛迪嗎
Did he mention Brody?

283
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,670
在什么背景下
In what context?

284
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,030
背景是他充當炸彈襲擊者
In the context of being the Bomber.

285
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,080
他并沒有詳細地說
Not in so many words, he didn't.

286
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,260
那他怎么說的
Well, what did he say?

287
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,190
他說據他所知  布洛迪沒有移動那輛車
He said as far as he knows, Brody didn't move the car.

288
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,640
據他所知
As far as he knows?

289
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,220
他對我不是這樣講的
That's not what he told me.

290
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,030
-好吧  -他很確定布洛迪不是元兇
- Okay.  -He told me definitively it wasn't brody.

291
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,280
你到底想說什么
What's your point?

292
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,930
他對你我的敘述為何不一致
Why would he tell us two different stories?

293
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,000
你是在詢問我  還是質疑我
Is that a question or an accusation?

294
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,320
我只是希望你可以坦誠地回答
Well, I guess I'd like a straight answer.

295
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,760
如果賈瓦迪提及過布洛迪沒有移動那輛車
And if Javadi even intimated that Brody didn't move the car, 

296
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,470
為什么不繼續逼問是誰動的
why not press him on who did?

297
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,660
我估計你生氣是因為
Well, you're angry because I didn't share

298
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,790
我從沒和你談過布洛迪  哪怕是私下里
a conversation with you about Brody. An inconclusive one.

299
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,550
不是  我生氣是因為你似乎完全不在乎
No, I'm angry because you seem entirely indifferent

300
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,150
抓住真正的炸彈襲擊者
to catching the actual bomber.

301
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,510
隨你怎么說  我沒意見
Speak for yourself. I'm all for it.

302
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,990
很高興聽到你這么說
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

303
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,740
這么說  你們倆
So... You two...

304
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,390
已經有計劃了
actually have a plan?

305
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,980
是的  我們想把這家伙給引出來
Yeah, we want to flush this guy out into the open.

306
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,090
怎么做
How?

307
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,000
你和利蘭·本尼特有來往  對吧
You know Leland Bennett personally, right?

308
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,950
我們一起跟國會議員打過幾次球
We've golfed congressional a few times together.

309
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,130
而且我們都是北方基金會董事會成員
And we serve on the board of the northern foundation.

310
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,730
你能很隨意的與他接觸嗎
How comfortable would you be making an approach?

311
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,840
非常隨意
Comfortable enough.

312
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,200
這么早就回來了
Oh, back already?

313
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,870
是的  感覺不舒服
Yeah, I'm not feeling well.

314
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,110
你可以走了
You can go.

315
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,620
今天我來照看他
I'll look after him today.

316
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,380
你確定
You sure?

317
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,950
是的  他怎么樣了
Yeah. How is he?

318
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,680
能坐起來了
Oh, sitting up.

319
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,720
有進步
Progress.

320
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,590
是的  就是有點吃力
Yeah, slowly but surely.

321
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,040
明天見
I'll see you tomorrow.

322
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,100
注意身體
Feel better.

323
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,380
謝謝
Thanks.

324
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,730
老爸
Baba  Joon.

325
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,130
今天我待在家里
I'm staying home today.

326
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,120
[波斯語]

327
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,080
我需要理由嗎
Do I need a reason?

328
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,290
[波斯語]

329
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,810
我不會丟掉工作的
I'm not going to lose my job.

330
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,340
[波斯語]

331
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,010
因為我確定
Because I'm sure.

332
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,810
說英語
Speak english.

333
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,940
[波斯語]

334
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,040
[波斯語]

335
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,330
說英語
English.

336
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,760
我來美國不是為了
I did not come to America

337
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,530
像個臟兮兮的阿拉伯人一樣流落街頭
to live in the street like a dirty Arab.

338
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,730
爸爸
Baba...

339
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,690
聽我說
Listen to me.

340
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,130
不會出現那種情況的
Nothing like that is going to happen.

341
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,050
不會有人把我們從家里趕出去
No one's going to throw us out of our home.

342
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,160
別擔心
Don't worry.

343
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,950
我的工作很穩定
My job's safe.

344
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,350
銀行的工作嗎
At the bank?

345
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,490
是的
Yes.

346
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,100
在投行
At the investment bank.

347
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,820
如果你在投行工作
If you work at the bank,

348
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,140
我們怎么會這么窮
Why are we not rich?

349
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,180
里克特  這是個德裔姓氏
Richter. That's a German surname.

350
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,160
我父母出生在漢堡
My parents were born in Hamburg.

351
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,100
你會說德語嗎
Do you speak it?

352
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,640
是的  當然會
Ja natürlich.

353
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,980
很實用
That's useful.

354
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,170
柏林有三家私人銀行是我們的客戶
We represent three private banking houses in Berlin.

355
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,760
能否給我們幾分鐘時間
Would you, uh, excuse me for just a moment?

356
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,820
當然
Of course.

357
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,450
你來早了
You're early.

358
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,890
我正在面試一位準合伙人
I'm in the middle of interviewing a new associate.

359
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,530
我長話短說
It won't take long.

360
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,460
上周基金會開會你沒參加
We missed you at the foundation meeting last week.

361
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,110
沒時間  工作太忙
Couldn't get there. Work.

362
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,090
應該為我們擠出時間
You gotta make time for us.

363
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,300
這個季度我多給你們一百萬還不夠嗎
It's not enough that I've raised over a million dollars this quarter?

364
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,010
你了解我的  從不滿足
You know me. Never satisfied.

365
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,250
不過  我今天來不是為了這事
But... That's not what this is about.

366
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,370
-不是嗎  -不是
- No? - No.

367
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,390
我有不祥的預感
Sounds ominous.

368
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,730
我現在負責反恐工作  順便說下
I do terror now, by the way.

369
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,710
估計你還不知道
I'm not sure you knew that.

370
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,330
我好像真不知道
I don't think I did.

371
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,890
最近看到有你們公司的名字出現
Your firm's name has come up lately.

372
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,310
還不止一次
More than once.

373
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,800
-好事還是壞事  -我不能說
- In what light? - That I can't tell you.

374
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,590
那為什么還告訴我這事
Then why tell me at all?

375
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,350
因為明天早上10點整
Because tomorrow morning at exactly 10:00,

376
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,610
我會參加一個高層絕密會議
I walk into a high level, top secret meeting

377
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,860
而你就是會議的議程
at which you are the agenda.

378
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,850
你想要我干什么
What do you want?

379
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,040
跟我們合作  實話實說
Cooperate with us. Come clean.

380
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,630
避免陷入一場即將升級為...
Get out in front of what's sure to turn into a...

381
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,700
極具傷害性的調查
a bruising investigation.

382
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,410
知道嗎
You know what?

383
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,360
20年前的我也許會被你嚇尿
20 years ago, I might've fallen for that weak shit.

384
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,610
但現在...
But today...

385
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,900
我隨你怎么查
Come after me if you want.

386
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,750
我沒什么好隱瞞的
I've got nothing to hide.

387
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,250
{\an8}一輛紅色手推車

388
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,590
蠟燭是為誰點的
Who's the candle for?

389
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,080
所有逝去的人
All the departed.

390
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,370
你是東正教徒嗎
You orthodox?

391
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,750
前男友
Old boyfriend.

392
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,750
聽說他之后辦過無數次喜酒
I hear the weddings go on forever.

393
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,010
喜酒的時間比婚姻還長  這笑話能樂一輩子
Longer than the marriages, so goes the joke.

394
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,910
本尼特先生需要你幫他查一個人
Mr. Bennett needs you to look into something for him.

395
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,470
我與馬吉德·賈瓦迪合作  不是利蘭·本尼特
My arrangement's with Majid Javadi, not Leland Bennett.

396
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,620
沒錯
Correct.

397
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,270
但本尼特先生今天得到的消息
But what Mr. Bennett heard today

398
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,210
也許會牽連到你
might reverberate onto you.

399
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,630
牽連我
Onto me?

400
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,490
需要我提醒你嗎
Do I need to remind you--

401
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,670
你已被外國政府招募為特工
You're a recruited agent of a foreign government?

402
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,830
我見過賈瓦迪  一次而已
I met with Javadi. Once.

403
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,440
我同意做他的顧問  而不是做特工
I agreed to consult with him. I'm nobody's agent.

404
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,890
不知道中情局能否理解其中的區別
I doubt the CIA would appreciate the distinction.

405
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,140
你得到什么消息了
What the hell do you know about it?

406
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,950
我知道本律所因為某些原因
I know the law firm appears to be

407
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,690
成為了被質詢的目標
the target of an inquiry of some kind.

408
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,810
這個我可不知道
Well, not one that I'm aware of.

409
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,450
這個警告是經私人渠道傳出來的
The warning was delivered personally,

410
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,370
沒通過官方渠道
outside of official channels.

411
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,490
是在局里工作的人嗎
By somebody who works at the agency?

412
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,540
本尼特先生的老熟人  是的
A longtime acquaintance of Mr. Bennett, yes.

413
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,090
那你想讓我做些什么
So what do you want from me?

414
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,810
確認一下這個報告
Confirm the report.

415
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,400
本尼特先生需要知道
Mr. Bennett needs to know

416
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,590
哪一部分業務處于調查之中
what part of the business is under investigation

417
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,780
以及他能做些什么以求自保
and what he can do to protect himself.

418
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,630
那可不容易
That's not going to be easy.

419
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,090
這么做的話不可能不讓人察覺
Not without setting off alarm bells.

420
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,380
你會想辦法搞定的
You'll figure something out.

421
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,630
讓我想辦法嗎
I'll figure something out?

422
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,400
而且顯然你的時間有限
And obviously there's a clock on this.

423
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,750
顯然極了
Obviously.

424
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,710
喂
Hello?

425
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,170
見效了
It's on.

426
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,410
跟我說說
Tell me.

427
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,360
我剛跟富蘭克林見過面
I just met with Franklin.

428
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,820
他們開始慌了
They're panicking over there.

429
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,940
讓他們慌吧
Well, let them.

430
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,980
等滿24小時
Wait 24 hours...

431
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,630
然后用我們知道炸彈襲擊者的消息給他們一擊
then hit them with the news we know who the bomber is.

432
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,100
好的
Will do.

433
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,480
索爾
Uh, Saul?

434
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,570
什么
Yeah?

435
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,960
在那之前我需要一點私人時間
I need some personal time between then and now.

436
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,390
行
You got it.

437
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,300
-謝謝  -你沒事吧
- Thanks. - You all right?

438
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,550
沒事
Yeah.

439
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,660
我應該早些告訴你布洛迪的情報
I should've shared that intel about Brody with you sooner.

440
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,240
抱歉  我沒考慮周全
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

441
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,840
你死里逃生
You've been to hell and back.

442
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,640
我知道這對你有多重要
I know how important this is to you.

443
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,400
我欠你的  我們都欠你的
I owe you. We all do.

444
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,140
只要我們找到真正的炸彈襲擊者...
Yeah, well, as long as we get the real bomber...

445
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,160
我們會的
We will.

446
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,180
是卡莉嗎
Carrie?

447
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,920
是  你怎么知道的
Yeah. How'd you know?

448
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,010
你的語氣
Tone of your voice.

449
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,830
你從不和其他人那么說話
You don't talk to anyone else like that.

450
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,750
我都沒注意到
Huh, I wasn't aware.

451
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,680
準備開飯嗎
You ready to eat?

452
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,320
要不要開瓶酒
Should I open a bottle of wine?

453
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,350
好主意
That's a great idea.

454
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,130
聽著
Listen...

455
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,160
我得離開幾天
I got to go away for a few days.

456
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,080
是嗎
You do?

457
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,600
-是的  -什么時候
- Yeah. - When?

458
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,060
明天
Tomorrow.

459
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,870
索爾
Saul...

460
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,050
我知道
I know.

461
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,800
時機不太好
The timing's not great.

462
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,260
但你說只是幾天對嗎
But you said only a couple of days?

463
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,460
對  頂多一周
Yeah. A week, at the most.

464
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,940
一周
A week?

465
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,180
要不是我非去不可
I wouldn't be going...

466
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,590
我也不會走的
if I didn't absolutely have to.

467
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,300
我可以跟你一起去
You know what, I could go with you.

468
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,120
-那可真是太棒了  -誰說不是呢
- Wouldn't that be great? - Why not?

469
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,000
這不是什么旅行
It's not that kind of trip.

470
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,910
雖然我希望是
I wish it were.

471
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,470
-干杯  -干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

472
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,910
為我們
To us.

473
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,960
你覺得惡心想吐嗎
You've been nauseous?

474
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,020
是的
Yeah.

475
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,870
一般來說現在應該已經沒那感覺了
Usually that goes away by now.

476
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,510
我也是這么聽說的
So I've heard.

477
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,210
我這里看的非常清楚
I'm getting a real clear image here.

478
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,760
你想知道是男孩還是女孩嗎
You want to know if it's a boy or a girl?

479
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,040
不想
No.

480
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,010
很抱歉最后才來找你
Sorry this is so last-minute.

481
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,050
不  很高興見到你
No, no, it's great to see you.

482
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,210
真是個驚喜
This is quite a surprise.

483
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,670
上周我還在院里見到了麥琪
I saw Maggie at the hospital last week,

484
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,110
她什么都沒提
she didn't say a thing.

485
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,530
她不知道
She doesn't know.

486
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,390
這跟你為什么第13周
Does that have anything to do with

487
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,790
才來做第一次孕檢有關系嗎
why you're coming in for your first prenatal exam

488
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,190
其實我沒打算要孩子
I didn't exactly plan this.

489
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,300
但你知道自己懷孕  已經有一陣子了吧
But you've known for some time.

490
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,810
用藥情況如何
What about medications?

491
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,340
你現在在服用哪些藥
What are you currently taking?

492
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,450
現在什么藥都沒吃
Uh, at the moment, nothing.

493
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,880
我知道
I see.

494
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,800
我孕前一個月服用過
I was on 1,800 milligrams of lithium

495
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,480
1800毫克的鋰鹽
for about a month there.

496
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,680
當時事情有點失控
Things were a little out of control.

497
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,580
更早之前
And, uh, before that,

498
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,970
喝了很多酒
There was a lot of drinking.

499
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,850
非常多
A... Lot.

500
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,430
在你知道自己懷孕之后嗎
After you knew?

501
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,760
我還沒想過要去弄一個育嬰室
I haven't been painting a nursery,

502
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,180
就那么放在一邊
just put it that way.

503
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,060
你是告訴我  你想做人流嗎
Are you telling me you wish to terminate?

504
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,360
我只想知道測試結果
I just want to know what the tests say.

505
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,830
是不是都還好
If things are okay.

506
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,190
你缺鐵
You're iron deficient.

507
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,040
這個我們可以補回來
We can fix that.

508
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,210
但是你的血壓非常高
But your blood pressure's very high.

509
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,780
我的工作壓力非常大
I've been... really stressed at work.

510
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,770
你真的應該放松一下
Well, you really should be taking it easy.

511
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,590
是啊  我會試試看
Yeah, I'll try.

512
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,410
卡莉  我們有辦法
Carrie, we can manage this.

513
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,130
保證你和寶寶的健康
Keep you and the baby healthy.

514
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,140
并不神奇  只是一個過程
It's not magic, it's a process.

515
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,680
如果你想要順其自然  決定權在你
You want to leave it to chance, that's up to you.

516
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,810
否則你就需要改變下自己的行為習慣
Otherwise you need to modify your behavior.

517
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,750
不是一周或是兩周  或者方便的時候
Not in a week or two, or when it's convenient.

518
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,140
而是現在
Now.

519
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,570
我現在做的事和孩子父親有關
What I'm doing, it has to do with the father.

520
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,340
我得把事情捋順
I need to make some things right.

521
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,030
這關系到很多人
It matters to a lot of people.

522
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,500
但這不一樣的  卡莉
But this is different, Carrie.

523
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,460
你現在已經不是自己一個人了
You're not on your own anymore.

524
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,130
法拉
Fara?

525
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,350
西拉吉
Sherazi?

526
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,160
你是哪位
And you are?

527
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,540
米切爾·克勞森總長辦公室
Mitchell Clausen. From the I.G.'s office.

528
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,600
什么總長
I.G.?

529
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,910
總監察長
Inspector General.

530
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,680
我能進來嗎
May I come in?

531
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,200
[波斯語]

532
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,420
[波斯語]

533
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,640
這邊請
This way.

534
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,660
我可以給你弄點喝的嗎
May I offer you something?

535
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,060
不用
I'm good. Um...

536
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,600
你連續兩天打電話來請病假
You called in sick two days in a row.

537
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,150
是怎么了呢
Is something the matter?

538
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,160
偏頭痛
Migraines.

539
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
可是你昨天開車去上班了
Yet you drove into work yesterday.

540
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,720
對
Yes.

541
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,230
你就呆坐在停車場半個多小時
Where you sat in the parking lot for over half an hour

542
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,190
還是決定走了
before deciding to leave again.

543
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,980
我那時候希望頭疼能止住
I was hoping the headache would go away.

544
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,040
所以你才去了 
Is that why you then paid a visit

545
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,580
最近發生雙尸案的
to 1426 Longhill Road,

546
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,250
長山路1426號嗎
where the recent double murder happened?

547
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:36,170
貝塞斯達警局記下了你的車牌號
The bethesda P.D. took down your license number.

548
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,110
警局為了調查這案子
The agency had to call in a lot of favors

549
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,140
召集了眾多幫手
to close that investigation.

550
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,290
你到那兒去會產生嚴重后果
Your going over there jeopardized all that.

551
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,790
我想看看案發現場
I wanted to see where it happened.

552
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,850
為什么
Why?

553
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,300
我很不安
It upset me. I...

554
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,770
我因此煩亂不堪
I was upset by it.

555
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:05,230
貝倫森局長對你表示出了
Director Berenson has shown an unusual degree

556
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,370
非同尋常的信任  西拉吉小姐
of confidence in you, Ms. Sherazi...

557
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,710
對你委以國家級的重要任務
entrusted you with matters of national importance.

558
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,000
那個我知道
I'm aware of that.

559
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,340
但是你目前的心理狀態
But your current state of mind

560
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,780
使你對局長和中情局的忠誠度
makes your loyalty to him

561
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,080
都有待商榷
and to the agency a very live issue.

562
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,200
轉告局長不用擔心
Tell the director not to worry.

563
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,660
我很好
I'm fine.

564
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,700
明天上班的時候
You can tell him yourself.

565
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,830
你自己跟他說吧
When you come into work tomorrow.

566
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,730
行
Yes.

567
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,880
貝倫森局長
Director Berenson?

568
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,360
這個貝倫森局長是誰
Who is this Director Berenson?

569
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,610
他是我上司
My boss.

570
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,700
他不是銀行里的人吧
But he's no banker, is he?

571
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,390
不是
No.

572
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,040
你依舊執迷不悟是吧
You went ahead, didn't you?

573
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,810
把我的話當耳旁風
In spite of everything I said?

574
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,630
爸爸  發生了恐怖襲擊
Baba, an attack happened.

575
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,910
那又怎樣
So what?

576
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,170
這又不關你的事
It's none of your business.

577
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,590
他們需要有國際金融背景
They needed Farsi speakers

578
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,020
又懂波斯語的人
with experience in international finance.

579
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,680
我必須幫他們
I had to help.

580
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,310
要是那些伊朗特工
And when the secret police find out

581
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,510
發現你為美國人賣命  那怎么辦
who you work for, what then?

582
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,160
我們在德黑蘭還有家人
We have family still in Tehran!

583
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,920
你的叔叔  嬸嬸  侄子
Your uncle, his wife and children.

584
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,620
到時候全部都要上黑名單  被處以絞刑
They will be added to the list of those to be hanged,

585
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,000
或者槍決
or shot!

586
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:31,880
[波斯語]

587
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,000
[波斯語]

588
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,080
我是美國人
I'm an American.

589
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,930
目標身份依舊不明  有可能就是
Target is still unknown, but presumed to be the man

590
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,140
在總部禮堂前安放炸彈的人
who put the bomb in position in front of the H.Q. Auditorium.

591
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,970
這是保羅·富蘭克林
This is Paul Franklin,

592
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,600
現在拿他做木馬  卡莉
our stalking horse. Carrie?

593
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,660
下午晚些時候  我會放出假消息
Later this afternoon, I'll promote misinformation

594
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,970
希望能唬住富蘭克林
to Mr. Franklin in the hopes that

595
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,160
利用他引出炸彈襲擊者
he'll lead us to the bomber.

596
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,380
如果計劃奏效  我們見面之后
Our assumption is that after the meeting,

597
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,380
他會聯系上頭尋求下一步行動指示
he'll reach out for instructions.

598
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,460
也就是這個人
To this man.

599
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,450
利蘭·本尼特  他們律所的一個大股東
Leland Bennett, one of the senior partners at the firm,

600
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,990
因此  本次行動從現在開始
which is why operation, from this moment forward,

601
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,670
針對這兩個人進行
requires a full complement of audio 

602
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,500
全程音視頻監控
and visual surveillance on both subjects.

603
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,640
不需要我再重申
I don't have to tell you

604
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,440
抓住這兩個家伙的重要性了吧
what catching this guy would mean.

605
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,440
換句話說  就是不聲張  不妄動  不露面
In other words, stay small, stay cool, stay out of sight.

606
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,560
好  開始行動
Okay, everybody. Game time.

607
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,320
你是對的
You were right.

608
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,610
快說
Tell me.

609
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,300
他們已經把總部爆炸案
They've connected your firm to the guy

610
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,970
牽罪到你們律所頭上了
who detonated the bomb at Langley.

611
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,710
不可能
That's not possible.

612
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,300
就這么告訴你  信不信由你
I'm telling you what I found out.

613
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,140
好吧
All right. Okay.

614
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,440
他們還認為
They're also under the impression

615
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,790
那個炸彈客現在仍在美國
That he's still here in the United States.

616
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,190
是不是真的
Is that true?

617
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,570
回答我  不然的話
Answer the question, or so help me,

618
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,080
我現在就拍屁股走人  你別想再見到我
I'll get up and you'll never see me again.

619
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,940
放松點  卡莉   深呼吸
Take it easy, Carrie. Take a breath.

620
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,660
別把我當孩子哄
No, don't patronize me.

621
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,050
好吧
Okay.

622
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,640
是真的  他還在美國
It's true, he's here.

623
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,570
具體在哪
He's here where?

624
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,490
你這么問就是說他們也沒掌握他的下落
I'm assuming that means they haven't located him yet.

625
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,410
對  他們還沒掌握
No, they haven't.

626
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,420
那他們到底掌握了些什么
Then exactly what do they have?

627
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,990
以同謀罪帶走利蘭·本尼特
A warrant pending before a FISA judge,

628
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,170
面見外國情報監督法法官的逮捕令
naming Leland Bennett a co-conspirator.

629
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,140
這份逮捕令還有多久生效
How soon before the warrant's active?

630
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,890
至少要好幾天
A few days, at least.

631
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,850
他們不會知道的  本尼特做事干凈利落
They won't find anything. Bennett's clean.

632
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,070
他一貫假人之手
He works through a cutout.

633
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,410
就是你
You.

634
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:01,410
別摻和了  讓我來處理這件事
Just lay low and let me handle this.

635
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,890
一直以來都是你在處理
You're the one who's been handling this,

636
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,820
恕我冒昧  你的話不怎么可信
so excuse me if your assurance isn't very assuring.

637
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,390
他們查到我們朋友了
They have a line on our friend.

638
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,120
他們是怎么知道的
How'd they get onto him?

639
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,180
- 不清楚  -那就去搞清楚
- No idea. - Well, find out.

640
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,830
有點太遲了  你不覺得嗎
It's a little late for that, don't you think?

641
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,810
你確定不是你這出了差錯嗎
You sure it wasn't your mistake?

642
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,710
你確定不是你的錯嗎
You sure it wasn't yours?

643
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,480
我們當時被要求向一名與政府有關系的
We were asked to provide material support

644
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,360
美國公民提供物資支持
to an American citizen with ties to the regime.

645
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,440
并沒有提及他與爆炸襲擊案有關
There was no mention of his involvement in the bombing.

646
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,850
后來提到了
There was later.

647
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,780
你說得對
Yes, there was.

648
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,330
我們當時就該把這個問題解決好
Well, we should've dealt with it then.

649
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,200
也許吧
Maybe.

650
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,710
他們知道他是誰嗎
Do they know his name?

651
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,230
不知道
No.

652
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,290
那我們暫且沒事
Then we're still okay.

653
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,680
你想讓他離開美國嗎
Do you want him out of the country?

654
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:09,930
是的
Yes.

655
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,780
最好換個新身份
Preferably with a new identity.

656
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,880
我該告訴他多少
How much do I tell him?

657
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,040
無所謂
I don't care.

658
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,600
把他弄出去就行
Just get him out.

659
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,370
富蘭克林發了條短信
Franklin's sending a text.

660
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,110
告訴我
Talk to me.

661
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,050
是個地址  還有時間
It's an address and time.

662
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,780
凌晨一點半在林奇堡的美景汽車旅館
Fairview Motel in Lynchburg, 01:30.

663
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,520
能查到他發給了誰嗎
Can we trace who he's sending it to?

664
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,850
不行  他的手機上一定裝了匿名軟件
No, there must be an anonymizer on the device.

665
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,230
別擔心  卡莉
Don't worry, Carrie.

666
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,720
只要我們盯住富蘭克林
As long as we stick on Franklin,

667
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,200
你就能找到那個炸彈襲擊者
you'll get your bomber.

668
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,660
他說得對
He's right.

669
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,510
我們派一支戰術小隊去汽車旅館
We'll send a tactical team to the motel.

670
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,510
富蘭克林一清理現場
They'll arrest the target

671
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,440
我們就逮捕目標
as soon as Franklin clears scene.

672
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,210
華盛頓特區交通部
D.C. department of transportation

673
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,850
告誡司機朋友們  由于市區街道封閉
is warning drivers to prepare for delays

674
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:37,370
從星期四至星期六做好延誤準備
due to street closures downtown Thursday through Saturday.

675
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,760
官方稱第十四街西北的南行方向
Officials say southbound 14th Street northwest

676
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,290
G大街與賓夕法尼亞大道之間的路段將被封閉
will be closed between G Street and Pennsylvania.

677
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,880
有情況
Here's something.

678
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,820
可能是他
It could be him.

679
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,020
沒錯  就是他  我看到了
Yeah, it is him. I've got a visual.

680
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,440
收到
Copy that.

681
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,300
他在干什么
What's he doing?

682
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,120
現在就在那干坐著
Just sitting there at the moment.

683
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,000
B小隊  你們看到他了嗎
Bravo, do you have eyes on?

684
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,800
我在屋頂上  監視著他的車
I'm looking down on the roof of his car.

685
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,010
任何人不許動
No one moves

686
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,170
直到富蘭克林離開
until Franklin leaves site.

687
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,500
收到
Copy that.

688
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,490
他在給誰打電話
He's calling someone.

689
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,130
在監聽了
We got it.

690
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,960
你來了嗎
Are you here?

691
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,280
就在外邊
Outside.

692
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,910
閃一下車燈
Flash your lights.

693
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,660
你在哪間房
What room are you in?

694
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,840
先告訴我怎么回事
First tell me what's happening.

695
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,800
你可能被暴露了
You may have been compromised.

696
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,900
他媽的怎么會這樣
How the hell did that happen?

697
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,170
已經發生了
It happened.

698
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,000
怎么發生的有區別嗎
What difference does it make how?

699
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,040
因為要完蛋的是我
Because I'm the one whose life is fucked.

700
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,710
要不是我先找到你
If I hadn't gotten to you first,

701
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,730
你就得蹲一輩子監獄了
you'd spend the rest of your life living in a cage.

702
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,850
你該感激我
Try on some gratitude.

703
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,470
你到底想不想收拾行李走人
You want your exfil package or not?

704
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,690
220號房
2-2-0.

705
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,030
這就來
Be right up.

706
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,120
操  他帶了武器
Shit. He's got a weapon.

707
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,670
什么
What?

708
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,530
他在裝消音器  天吶  你們看到了嗎
Now he's silencing it. Jesus, you seeing this?

709
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,820
他有把槍
He's got a gun!

710
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,850
B小隊  你能確定嗎
Bravo, can you confirm?

711
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,570
不能  我的視野很模糊
Negative. My view is obscured.

712
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,970
他不是要帶走炸彈襲擊者
He's not exfiltrating the bomber,

713
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,140
他要干掉他
he's taking him out.

714
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,330
你沒法確定  卡莉
You don't know that, Carrie.

715
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,230
裝消音器還能有別的原因嗎
Why else would he have a silencer?

716
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,810
她說得對  斯科特
She's right, Scott.

717
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,290
我看到武器了
I make the weapon.

718
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,070
我說了富蘭克林要干掉那個人
I'm telling you Franklin's gonna kill that guy.

719
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:34,780
聽我說  我們剛聽到本尼特告訴富蘭克林
Listen to me. We just heard Bennett telling Franklin

720
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,580
把那個家伙帶出國境 
to get the guy out of the country.

721
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,400
或許本尼特改主意了
Maybe Bennett changed his mind.

722
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:42,340
不管怎樣  我們得先確保讓富蘭克林繼續行動
Either way, our priority is to keep Franklin in play.

723
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,260
那就任由他殺掉那個炸彈襲擊者嗎
So we just let him kill the bomber?

724
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,470
如果必要的話  是的
If necessary, yes.

725
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,360
我們之前不是這樣定的
That wasn't the deal.

726
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,980
那個襲擊者是唯一可以證明布洛迪清白的人
The bomber's the only way to prove that Brody's innocent.

727
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,760
可是制止富蘭克林會暴露你的身份
And stopping Franklin now would blow your cover

728
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,080
還有賈瓦迪回到德黑蘭的計劃
and Javadi's back in Tehran.

729
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,330
你懂了吧
You get that, right?

730
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,660
在富蘭克林離開前
Until Franklin is clear,

731
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,970
我要求全部小隊停止行動原地待命
I want all teams to stand down.

732
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,880
全部小隊原地待命  收到請回答
All teams, acknowledge standing down.

733
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,140
B小隊  原地待命
Bravo here, standing down.

734
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,720
A小隊  原地待命
Alpha team standing down.

735
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,110
卡莉  收到請回答
Carrie, acknowledge.

736
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,250
卡莉
Carrie?

737
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,530
卡莉  你他媽要干啥
Carrie, what the fuck are you doing?

738
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,490
卡莉  回到車里去
Carrie, go back to the van!

739
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,420
索爾答應過我  會讓這個人活著
Saul promised me this guy alive.

740
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,420
現在這里不是索爾說了算
Saul's not calling the shots here. 

741
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,810
他答應過我的  該死  讓他接電話
He promised me, goddamn it. Get him on the phone!

742
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,920
沒有時間  回去
There's no time. Turn around!

743
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,650
卡莉  馬上回去
Carrie, turn around now,

744
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,590
不然我們就要阻止你了
Or we will stop you.

745
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,570
這是對你的最后警告
This is your last warning.

746
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,230
聽他的話  卡莉
Listen to the man, Carrie.

747
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,800
B小隊  我現在授權使用武力
Bravo, I am authorizing force.

748
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,300
開槍射擊  我重復一次
Take the shot. I repeat:

749
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,140
-開槍射擊  -我來
- Take the shot. - Let me.

750
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,390
卡莉  我是奎恩
Carrie, this is Quinn.

751
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,670
快離開
Break away.

752
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,930
對不起  我不能
I'm sorry. I can't.

753
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,430
你會搞死我們的  卡莉
You're fucking us, Carrie.

754
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,650
幾個月的努力  你的努力
Months of work. Your work.

755
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,110
我不在乎
I don't care.

756
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,880
卡莉  我會開槍的
Carrie, I will take the shot.

757
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,250
要來不及了  看在上帝的份上
Window's closing, for christ's sake!

758
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,310
他進去了  富蘭克林進屋了
He's in. Franklin is inside.

759
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,260
把她帶走  趕緊的
Pick her up, for god's sake!

760
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,690
走  快走
Go! Go!

761
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,780
挪開
Move it!

762
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,460
我的老天爺
Jesus christ.

763
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,590
你當時磨蹭什么呢
What was the delay?

764
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,650
我攔住她了  不是嗎
I stopped her, didn't I?

765
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,390
跟她一起走  我來監視富蘭克林
Go with her. I'm watching franklin.

766
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,620
-接通醫院的電話了  -告訴他們
- Hospital's on the line. - Tell 'em we got

767
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,280
有人左上臂受了槍傷
a gunshot wound to the upper left bicep,

768
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,910
大出血  可能是射穿動脈了
significant bleeding, might have clipped an artery.

769
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,030
堅持住  你會沒事的
Hold on. You're gonna be all right.

770
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,420
真該死
Goddamn it!

771
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,120
媽的  他媽的
Fuck! Fuck!

772
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,870
-奎恩  -什么事
- Quinn... - Yeah?

773
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,210
那個炸彈襲擊者死了嗎
...Is the bomber dead?

774
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,650
-死了  -媽的
- Yeah. - Fuck!

775
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,400
他媽的
Fuck!

776
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,270
一定出事了
Something's going on.

777
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,680
-沒錯  你中槍了  -是啊  少廢話
- Yeah, you got shot. Yeah, no shit!

778
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,950
你開的槍
You shot me!

779
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,510
不是  我是說出了別的事
No, I mean, something's going on.

780
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,910
這次行動...這次行動說不通
None of this... none of this makes sense.

781
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,560
呼吸  好嗎  深呼吸  拜托
Just breathe, okay? Deep breaths. Come on.

782
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,870
過來
Come here.

783
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,750
近一點
Come closer.

784
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,440
索爾在他媽什么地方
Where the fuck is Saul?

785
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,740
您的旅途順利嗎
You have a good flight?

786
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:38,940
還不錯
Yeah, fine.

787
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,200
至少把我送過來了
Got me here.

788
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:53,320
這邊走
Hey. This way.

789
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:55,960
在這里等著
Wait here.

790
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,170
再過一個月  這里會更熱的
In another month, it's even hotter.

791
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,640
你想不到有多熱
You won't believe.

792
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:27,370
或許我會用那一千萬美元裝一臺空調
Maybe I use the $10 million to put in an air conditioner.

793
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,010
在那里
There.
