1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,160
"妙警贼探" 前情提要...
Previously on White Collar...

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,430
Curtis Hagen今天被提前释放了
Curtis Hagen was granted early release from prison today.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,930
Mosconi法典
The Mosconi Codex.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,460
你让我冒着进监狱的风险去偷一本破书?
You want me to risk jail for a little light reading?

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,430
这是特别探员David Siegel
Special Agent David Siegel.

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,860
你一定是我的新负责人了
You must be my new handler.

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,400
确实
Must be.

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,130
Teddy Winters这个名字有印象吗?
Does the name Teddy Winters mean anything to you?

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,660
他们找到我了
They found me.

10
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,000
最起码你不用再进监狱了
Well, we kept you out of prison.

11
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,330
是的 为此我付出了所有
Yeah, that cost me everything.

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,600
给你法典
The Codex.

13
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,030
我们的合作挺顺利的
This relationship is working wonderfully.

14
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,500
- 什么时候是个头?  - 等到我拿到我想要的时候
- When does it end?  - When I get what I want.

15
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,460
我们会找出来凶手的 Neal
We'll find out who did this, Neal.

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,900
我保证
I promise.

17
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,960
他叫David Siegel
David Siegel.

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,100
在Bushwick区的Linden街和中央大道的交界被发现
Found on the corner of Linden and Central in Bushwick.

19
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,760
死因是胸部中枪
Cause of death was a gunshot wound to the sternum.

20
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,100
当场失血过多死亡
He bled out instantly.

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,560
现场我们找到了一个弹壳
We retrieved a shell casing from the scene.

22
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,260
是9毫米口径的史密斯维森39手枪的
9-millimeter caliber round from a Smith & Wesson 39 series.

23
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,300
这张截图来自周围的交通录像
This image was taken from a traffic cam in the area.

24
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,130
画面上的人物身份还没确定
The subject is still unidentifiable.

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,160
15天已经过去了
15 days have passed,

26
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,360
我们还是毫无头绪
And we are no closer to figuring out who did this and why.

27
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,400
有些人认为Siegel探员
The working theory stands that Agent Siegel was a victim

28
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,560
是街头行凶的无辜受害者
of an indiscriminate mugging gone wrong.

29
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,960
他的钱包和手枪还没有找到
His wallet and firearm are still missing.

30
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,560
我们部门要竭尽全力
Our division has dedicated all of its resources

31
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,830
调查此案
to this investigation.

32
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,700
但实际上 我们还有
But the truth is we had caseloads beforehand,

33
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,830
更紧急的案子要处理
and those caseloads still need to be resolved.

34
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,000
所以联合行动小组不会解散
So the joint operation center will remain in this building,

35
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,700
有一组探员会继续调查这个案子
And a team of agents will continue to pursue all leads.

36
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,630
其余人手会被分配到别的案子
The remainder of you will resume your active assignments.

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,300
纪念David Siegel最好的方式
The best way we can honor David Siegel

38
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,730
就是做好我们的工作
is by doing our jobs.

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,230
想要找我谈谈的人可以随时过来
Counseling remains available to anyone who still needs to talk.

40
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,730
散会
That's all.

41
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,530
你还好吧?
You okay?

42
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,300
嗯 我很好 怎么了?
Yeah. I am. What's going on?

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,460
你知道Caffrey现在的情况吗?
You got any updates on Caffrey's status?

44
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,800
他还被软禁在家
His house arrest is still in effect.

45
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,500
嗯 如果你还想雇佣他
Yeah, well, he can't stay there forever

46
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,530
可不能让他永远待在家里
if you're gonna use him.

47
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,000
他需要一个负责人
He needs a handler.

48
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,430
啊 晚安
Ah, bonsoir.

49
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
你怎么穿着浴袍?
What's with the bathrobe?

50
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,260
客房的水压太低
The water pressure's weak in the guest room.

51
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,560
所以我借用了一下你的浴室
I needed to borrow your shower.

52
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,530
你要在这里住多久?
How much longer are you staying here?

53
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,060
直到我找到了稳定的经济来源
Just until I get myself on some financially secure footing.

54
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,830
我可以在阳台把自己吹干吗?
Okay if I air dry on the terrace?

55
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,200
不 Moz 我怎么才能帮你
No, Moz. Tell me how I can help.

56
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,830
那家伙夺走了我的一切
Big brother burned through all of my resources.

57
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,000
安全屋没有了 钱也没有了
No safe houses, no capital.

58
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,100
更糟的是 联邦调查局
What's worse, the Federal Bureau of Invasion

59
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,260
把你困在了这个密不透风的狗窝里
has confined you to this impenetrable dog pound.

60
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,030
- 这是我家  - 宽敞明亮的监狱
- It's my apartment.  - A sublimely spacious cell.

61
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,600
所以你就是我的狱友了?
Does that make you my cellmate?

62
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,660
我更喜欢"监狱俏佳人"这个说法
I prefer the term "mis-incarcerated."

63
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,060
听起来像是你赢了监狱选美比赛
That sounds like you just won a prison pageant.

64
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,430
首先 我确实能赢 其次 我会再想个名字
A, I could. B, I'll think of a better term.

65
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,760
还在研究法典?
Still working on the Codex?

66
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,900
我不想让自己胡思乱想
I'm trying to keep my mind occupied.

67
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,230
不管用的
And it's not working.

68
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,660
Siegel总是浮现在我的脑海
I can't stop thinking about Siegel.

69
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,400
我一直在想他的死是不是我造成的
Can't stop wondering if it was my fault in any way.

70
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,800
- 可能Hagen...  - 别说了
- If Hagen somehow...  - Stop right there.

71
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,700
尸体是在Bushwick区被发现的
The body was found in Bushwick.

72
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,400
我和Hagen几小时前在那里见过面
That's where Hagen and I met a few hours earlier.

73
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,630
这不是巧合
It's not a coincidence.

74
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,960
巧合是命运之神最喜欢的把戏
Coincidence is fate's favorite tool.

75
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,960
因为你不知道是谁干的
You're condemning yourself

76
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,330
所以就在责怪自己
because there's no one else to blame.

77
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,660
我被困在这里 什么也做不了
I can't do anything while I'm stuck here.

78
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,530
如果有新的负责人
I'd be better off with a new handler

79
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,800
或是回监狱里也比这样好
or even thrown back in prison.

80
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,530
猫咪探长可不会让你回去的
The Suit will never let that happen.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,100
有新任务?
New assignment?

82
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,100
部门需要破几起案子
The department needs a few wins right now.

83
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,230
所以你就把我叫来了?
Is that why you called me in? 

84
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,560
- 我们要开始工作吧  - 我们?
- We're going back to work.  - We?

85
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,330
Peter 谢谢 但你不必为我做这么多
Oh, Peter, thank you, but you don't have to do that for me.

86
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,700
我是特别探员主管
I'm ASAC.

87
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,060
这里我说的算 我决定
I make decisions around here, and I've decided

88
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,800
我们要提高办案效率
that I'm going to actively pursue investigations.

89
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,860
- 就是这样  - 从哪个案子开始?
- That's what we do.  - Where do we start?

90
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,330
- 金融诈骗案  - 能不能换一个?
- Accounting scam.  - Can we start over?

91
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,360
你没得选 我来选
You don't get to choose. I choose.

92
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,430
我们的第一个案子应该选个好的
Our first case should be a good one.

93
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,960
这个就不错
This is a good one.

94
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,960
- 看看这个...  - 我要睡着了
- Now, look here...  - I just fell asleep.

95
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,000
放开我 我愿意合作
Don't grab me. I'm cooperating.

96
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,460
老实点 否则我就给你戴上手铐
Well, calm down, or I'm gonna throw you in cuffs.

97
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,830
嘿 怎么回事?
Hey, what's going on?

98
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,760
刚才他来到大厅
Guy strolled into the lobby two minutes ago.

99
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,200
说想和联邦调查局的人谈谈
Said he needs to talk to the FBI.

100
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,600
这是在他身上发现的
Found this on him.

101
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,300
我要自首
I need to confess to a crime.

102
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,860
这个案件貌似不错
Looks like it is gonna be a good one.

妙警贼探 第五季第4集

106
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,000
Nate Griffith 从1998年开始频繁进出拘留所
Nate Griffith. In and out of lockup since '98.

107
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,500
你早就想抢劫银行了 对吧?
Liked to knock off banks for a while there, didn't you?

108
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,360
那是很久之前的了 好吧?
That was a long time ago, okay?

109
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,730
我当时有债要还 最后还清了
I had dues to pay, and I paid 'em.

110
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,330
我一直想做回好人
Mm-hmm. I've been trying to do right

111
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,660
为了我的家庭
by my family ever since.

112
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,030
- 你的家庭  - 我有一个儿子
- Your family.  - I've got a son.

113
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,930
叫Andrew 他... 他七岁了
Andrew. He's... he's seven.

114
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,730
你快告诉我整个案件吧
Why don't you walk me through this?

115
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,900
好 好
Okay, okay.

116
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,300
我之前听说过这个在曼哈顿的证券保险库
So I'd heard about this securities vault in Manhattan

117
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
可能有200万现金
that supposedly had 2 million in cash in it.

118
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,700
谁告诉你的?
Who told you about it?

119
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,860
只是听来的 不知道
Just heard. I don't know.

120
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,560
你越隐瞒 就越...
Look, the more you withhold...

121
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,360
我发誓 没有隐瞒
I'm not trying to, I swear.

122
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,100
公司的名字是什么?
What's the name of the company?

123
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,200
是Kaplan安保公司
It's Kaplan Securities.

124
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,460
我... 我先搞清楚怎么绕开保护系统
So I... I figured out how to bypass the lock system

125
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,930
在大厦后面
in the rear of the building.

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,730
然后直奔保险库那 席卷一空
I just went straight to the vault, and I cleaned it out.

127
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,400
你用什么破解保险库?
What did you use to crack the vault?

128
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,900
我觉得我有密码
I think I had the combination.

129
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,000
你觉得?
You think?

130
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,430
听着 我是在说实话
Look, I'm telling you the truth.

131
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,160
好 你要明白
All right, look, you gotta understand,

132
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,600
这件事对我来说... 就像一场噩梦
this whole thing... it's like some sort of bad dream.

133
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,130
它只是零零星星地浮现在我眼前
It's only coming back to me in bits and pieces.

134
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,060
但我知道不能这样下去
But all I know is that I couldn't stop.

135
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,130
剩下的钱在哪?
Where was the rest of that money?

136
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,730
在... 在中央总部的一个柜子里
It's... it's in Grand Central in a locker, um...

137
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
柜子编号是941
in number 941.

138
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,560
密码
Combination.

139
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,100
你听着 这不是在玩
Yeah, see, this isn't a game.

140
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,100
算上你的前科 你要呆上10年监狱
With your priors, you're looking at ten years.

141
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,560
我知道
I know that.

142
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,630
一个钟头之前 我在去中央的路上
Look, an hour ago, I was walking to Grand Central

143
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,400
拿剩下的钱 然后我就...
to get the rest of the cash, and I just...

144
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,430
一直回想自己的所作所为
I kept thinking about what I'd done,

145
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,230
我违背了对自己和家人的承诺
how I'd broken that promise to myself and my family.

146
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,230
突然... 我被一辆不知从哪来的出租车撞到了
And then bam... I get hit by this cab, outta nowhere.

147
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,700
伤到头了
That's how I got this.

148
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,160
这是一个警钟
Look, it was a wake-up call.

149
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,000
如果我继续重操旧业下去
I cannot set a good example for my son

150
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,930
就无法给儿子树立一个好榜样
if all I'm gonna do is relapse.

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,360
我们在Griffith的包里找到的... 这可以解释他的行为
We found those in Griffith's bag... could explain his behavior.

152
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,800
他还有各色的药丸
He's got a pill for every color of the rainbow.

153
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,500
相呐斯 镇静剂 安定药...
Xanax, valium, ativan...

154
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,900
而且是高剂量的
Heavy doses too,

155
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,560
都是同一个精神科医生开的
all authorized by the same psychiatrist.

156
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,660
Mara Summers医生
Dr. Mara Summers.

157
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,560
来 喝点东西
Here. Drink this.

158
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,600
谢谢
Thanks.

159
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,960
你看上去和那些人不一样
You don't seem like those other guys.

160
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,800
因为我不是他们啊
That's 'cause I'm not.

161
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,800
其实 我以前和你很像
In fact, I used to be a lot like you.

162
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,530
你也打劫过银行?
You robbed banks?

163
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,660
我犯了很多错
I did a lot of things.

164
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,600
关键是我最后改过自新了
The point is I was able to turn myself around.

165
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,230
正如你正在做的 你可以和我实话实说
Just like you're trying to do. You can be straight with me.

166
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,860
你还有什么漏掉的吗?
Is there anything else you remember?

167
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,130
我知道你想帮我
I know you're trying to help me,

168
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,460
但我已经坦白说完了 Caffrey先生
but I honestly can't, Mr. Caffrey.

169
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,000
别再叫我Caffrey先生了
Don't ever call me Mr. Caffrey.

170
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,100
叫我Neal 来吧
It's Neal. Come on.

171
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,900
好的 继续找 20分钟后汇报
All right, keep looking. Update me in 20.

172
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,530
我派了一个团队去检查中央的保险柜
I sent a team to check the lockers at Grand Central.

173
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,930
那里什么都没有
There's nothing there.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,230
现在变得越来越奇怪了
This gets stranger by the minute.

175
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,230
我不喜欢这样
I don't like it.

176
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,630
是吗?
Really?

177
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,760
一个人拿着一堆现金走进联邦调查局
Guy walks into the FBI with stacks of cash

178
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,360
然后求你抓他啊
and begs you to cuff him.

179
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,900
- 我以为那是你的兴奋点  - 我没有兴奋点
- I'd think that was your catnip.  - I don't have catnip.

180
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,900
- 每个人都有兴奋点 不是吗?  - 你的是什么?
- Oh, everybody has catnip. Yeah?  - What's yours?

181
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,200
"真实主妇"秀
Real Housewives.

182
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,960
多多益善
Can't get enough.

183
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,900
钱上都有Griffith的手指印
Money has Griffith's prints all over it.

184
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,600
我们看看这些序号
We're running the serial numbers.

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,660
你发现什么了?
What do you have?

186
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:44,000
每张纸币左上角的质地摸起来不一样
Texture feels funny in the top-left corner of every bill.

187
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,930
我要再仔细看看
I'm gonna need a closer look.

188
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,560
做过标记的
Marked bills.

189
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,600
本来有可能用于地下交易或结算
Cash could've been used in a controlled buy or payoff.

190
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,000
或者另有来源
Or it's from another score.

191
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,530
对 有没有可能这家伙偷的钱
Yeah, is it possible our guy stole money

192
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,400
本来就是其他人偷来的?
that was already stolen?

193
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,860
我觉得Neal和我该亲自去检查那个保险库
I think Neal and I should check out that vault.

194
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,230
联邦调查局的 要见你们经理
FBI here to see the manager.

195
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,960
他在那
That's him there.

196
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,330
自己熟悉下数据库
Familiarize yourself with the database

197
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,900
从你桌面上的客户名册开始
starting with the client roster on your desktop.

198
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
然后 要按照日期和时间
After that, I want you to categorize

199
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,230
对本月的财务方案进行分类
this month's financial packages by date and time.

200
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,060
- 你都清楚了吗?  - 清楚了 
- Are you getting all of this?  - Yes, sir.

201
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,830
很好 那回到自己的座位吧 
Good. Back to your desk, then.

202
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,830
抱歉 先生们
Ah. Apologies, gentlemen.

203
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,160
他第一天上班 我能做点什么吗?
It's his first day. How can I help you?

204
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,000
我是特别探员Peter Burke
Special agent Peter Burke,

205
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,330
这是我同事Neal Caffrey
and this is my coworker Neal Caffrey.

206
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,800
你好
How you doing?

207
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,930
我们是来调查上周的盗窃事件的
We're here about the break-in that happened last week.

208
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,930
盗窃?
Break-in?

209
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,700
今早一个出了名的重罪犯去我们办公室
This morning a known felon walked into our offices

210
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,560
承认自己洗劫一空了四号保险库
to confess to emptying the contents of vault number four.

211
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,960
不可能
Oh, impossible.

212
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,860
我们没有客人上报失窃
None of our clients have reported anything missing,

213
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,730
我也保证我们的安全系统是顶尖的
and I assure you our security is top-notch.

214
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,130
其实你还可以升级下
Actually, you could use an upgrade.

215
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,530
你们保险库的U.I.安全许可级别仅是一级
The U.I. Approval on your vaults is class I.

216
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,430
也就是说30分钟之内就可以撬开
That means they can be breached in 30 minutes or less.

217
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,030
当然也需要合适的切割轮
I mean, you need the right cutting wheel

218
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,430
和硬质合金钻头
and carbide drill, of course.

219
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,930
- 我建议升级到三级  - 可以看下保险库吗?
- My advice, go class III.  - Could I see the vault?

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,030
我们严格保护
Uh, we're very protective

221
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,600
客户的财产和隐私
about our clients' possessions and anonymity.

222
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,960
没有搜查令的话
Without a warrant,

223
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,800
我只能提供这些信息
this is all the info I can give you.

224
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,300
如果还有其他问题 请随时联系
Feel free to call if you have further questions.

225
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,630
再见 先生们
Gentlemen.

226
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,060
如果保险库里的钱是非法获取的
Well, if the cash in the vault was illegally obtained,

227
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,760
无论谁是户主
it makes sense that whoever owns it

228
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,330
都不会上报失窃 这讲得过去
Wouldn't want to report it missing.

229
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,230
除非他们也想进监狱
Unless they want to go to prison too.

230
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,460
但这些都是推测的
But this is all speculative.

231
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,060
不足以申请搜查令
It's not good enough for a warrant.

232
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,960
Louis啊!
Louis!

233
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,630
如果我们看不了保险库
If we can't get a look at the vault,

234
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,100
也许可以找下户主是谁的
maybe we can find out who owns it.

235
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,800
Louis啊!
Louis!

236
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,930
谢谢
Thank you.

237
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,260
有办法吗?
What's the play?

238
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,000
看来Kaplan安保公司今天会有
Well, Kaplan Securities is going to have

239
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,760
更多新员工了
more than one new employee today.

240
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,200
- 那个宣传册还在吗?  - 在
- You still have that brochure?  - Yeah.

241
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,100
谢谢
Thanks.

242
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,260
好
Okay.

243
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,130
小心你的手指 Peter...
Watch your fingers. Peter...

244
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,600
你以前肯定做过
You've done this before.

245
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,630
即黏胶水
Instant glue.

246
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,260
先凑合用一下吧
Well, it'll do in a pinch.

247
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,760
你吓到我了
You frighten me.

248
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,230
事实上 往往你才是吓人的那个
Actually, you're usually the frightening one.

249
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,460
你钱包里有照片吗?
You have any pictures in your wallet?

250
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,260
需要帮忙吗?
Can I help you?

251
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,100
我是Eric Roberts 你的主管
Eric Roberts. I'm your supervisor.

252
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,630
Epstein先生没提过你
Mr. Epstein didn't say anything about you.

253
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,300
- 我要打个电话...  - 不是吧 只有你和Epstein先生
- I have to call and...  - What, you and Mr. Epstein

254
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,900
在这上班吗?
are the only employees here?

255
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,230
我知道你还要处理那些财务方案
Look, I know you have those financial packages to work on,

256
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,360
但这位贵宾更重要
but this man takes precedence.

257
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,260
Wilcox先生是首屈一指的进出口商人
Mr. Wilcox is a premier importer and exporter

258
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,660
在东岸可是叱咤风云
up and down the east coast,

259
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,300
他想开个账户
and he'd like to open an account.

260
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,760
他会的
He would.

261
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,360
现在填写申请书
That means start-up papers.

262
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,130
规定不是这样的 我们有系统流程
That isn't protocol. We have a system.

263
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,930
- 你最好给我搞定  - 必须的 Wilcox先生
- You better make this work.  - Very good, Mr. Wilcox.

264
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,300
我来这五年了
I've been here for five years,

265
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,860
你只是初来乍到
You've been here for five seconds.

266
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,760
赶快准备文件
Start up paperwork.

267
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,400
楼下大厅左边第三个办公室
Third office, down the hall, left-hand side.

268
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,300
好 好 我很快回来
Of course. Of course. I'll be right back.

269
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,630
好的 四号保险库
All right. Vault number four.

270
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,630
留意点
Keep a lookout.

271
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,360
好
Yeah.

272
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,430
严格来说我要先拿到法院指令
Technically I should get a court order

273
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,800
才能操作那台电脑
to go through that computer.

274
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,000
幸亏你的线人有别的办法
Well, good thing your CI doesn't need one.

275
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,500
Neal啊
Neal.

276
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,660
数据库里有250个客户
There are 250 clients in this database.

277
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,900
按照保险库编号缩小范围
Narrowing it down by vault number.

278
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,430
我找到了
I found it.

279
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,930
四号保险库
Vault number four.

280
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,130
真奇怪
That's strange.

281
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,130
不是个人注册的
It's not registered to a person.

282
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,730
那是什么?
To what, then?

283
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,700
是一间公司注册的 Niteowl控股公司
To a corporation. Niteowl Holdings.

284
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,900
- 谢谢  - 太感谢了 先生
- Thank you.  - Thank you very much, sir.

285
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,530
够了 撤吧
That's good enough. Go.

286
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,000
Louis啊!
Louis!

287
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,630
这是一间虚拟的公司
It's a dummy corp.

288
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,230
有人在用Noteowl公司作掩饰
Someone is using Niteowl as a front.

289
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,530
无论Griffith偷了谁的东西 他们的身份都隐藏得很好
Whoever Griffith stole from covered their identity nicely.

290
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,860
对
Mm-hmm.

291
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,600
大伙们 我找到那些带记号纸币的线索了
Gentlemen, I got a lead on those marked bills.

292
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,130
两个月之前 曼哈顿一辆运钞车被洗劫一空了
Two months ago, a Manhattan mutual truck was cleaned out.

293
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,160
所以现在银行规定在所有纸币上做记号
Now it's the bank's policy to mark all currency

294
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,460
以防发生盗窃
in case any kind of theft occurs.

295
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,860
纽约警局找到了嫌疑人 只是不能定他罪
NYPD had a suspect, just couldn't nail him.

296
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,760
Shane Jacoby 有过殴打他人的前科
Shane Jacoby. Priors for assault.

297
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,660
他貌似是Niteowl控股公司的执行总裁
And likely CEO of Niteowl Holdings.

298
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,430
Griffith和Jacoby互不相识
So Griffith and Jacoby don't know each other,

299
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,530
但他们是有关联的 怎么关联?  
but they're linked. How?

300
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,460
我估计已经找到关联点了
I might've found that link.

301
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,660
Shane Jacoby接受了一个法庭命令的治疗
Shane Jacoby received a court-ordered treatment

302
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,600
和治疗Griffith的是同一个精神科医生
from a psychiatrist who prescribed Griffith his meds.

303
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,160
Mara Summers医生
Dr. Mara Summers.

304
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,030
冲动控制障碍有五个常见阶段
There are five common stages to ICD,

305
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,030
始于冲动 终于愧疚
Beginning with the impulse and ending with guilt

306
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,330
或毫无愧疚
or lack thereof.

307
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,430
最后这一阶段的...
It is that final...

308
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,700
真是个有意思的专业领域
This is an interesting area of expertise.

309
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,530
是啊 难怪Griffith找上了她
Yeah, I can see why Griffith went to her.

310
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,460
我发现那些为自己的行为
I found the patient who experiences guilt

311
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,200
感到愧疚的病人 更容易回归
from his actions is most likely to fall back

312
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,160
初始的摧毁性模式
into the original destructive pattern.

313
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,600
这是我在研究过程中 与我合作的多名改造罪犯的
This is generally the case with the bulk of reformed criminals

314
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,400
普遍情况
I've worked with in my studies.

315
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,460
明天的课上我们会详细讨论
More on that in tomorrow's lecture.

316
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:34,460
感谢大家的参与
Thank you all for coming. 

317
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,960
她的一些客户具有犯罪倾向
She's got clients prone to commit crimes,

318
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,730
她能进入他们的大脑
and she's got access to their heads.

319
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
然后控制他们
She could be manipulating them.

320
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,030
亦或她只是在做本职工作
Or she could just be doing her job.

321
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,260
想弄明白只有一个办法
Only one way to find out.

322
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,060
- 讲得太棒了 谢谢您  - 谢谢
- Excellent, thank you.  - Thank you.

323
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,600
Summers医生
Dr. Summers.

324
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,800
抱歉 你是...
I'm sorry, you are...

325
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,200
我叫Neal Caffrey
My name's Neal Caffrey.

326
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,200
我是个已定罪的重刑犯 我需要您的帮助
I'm a convicted felon, and I need your help.

327
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,060
不得不说 您对于冲动控制障碍的研究令人惊叹
Your work and research on ICD is impressive, to say the least.

328
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,530
我对该领域很有兴趣
I have a predilection for its study.

329
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,030
哦 Summers医生 这就是我和您说的人 Peter
Oh, Dr. Summers, this is the man I told you about, Peter.

330
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,460
我的假释官
My parole officer.

331
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,500
你看管Caffrey先生多久了?
How long have you been keeping an eye on Mr. Caffrey?

332
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,100
- 可以说一直都是吧  - 我得把话说明白了
- Eternally, some might say.  - I have to be honest.

333
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,930
我与绝大多数改造罪犯的合作都是无偿的
Most of my work with reformed criminals is pro bono.

334
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,330
但现在我实在没时间
Right now I simply don't have time

335
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,660
接新的病人
to take on any new patients.

336
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,660
我并不是想要您免费服务
Oh, I'm not asking you for a free session.

337
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,700
- 我收费很贵  - 这不是问题
- I'm expensive.  - Won't be a problem.

338
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,060
Peter 你何不向Summers医生简要介绍下我?
Peter, would you mind briefly giving Dr. Summers my resume?

339
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,500
简要介绍? 好吧
Briefly? Right.

340
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,460
Neal因伪造债券而被定罪
Well, Neal's been convicted of bond forgery.

341
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,560
同时 他牵涉了超过四十桩
He's also been implicated in over four dozen

342
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,130
艺术品伪造案
works of counterfeit art.

343
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,460
另外他还是数起备受关注的
And there's also the fact that he's still a suspect

344
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,130
联邦案件的嫌疑人
in several ongoing high-profile federal investigations.

345
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,530
- 具体是什么案件?  - 随便说 都有
- For what, exactly?  - Pick something.

346
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,030
总而言之 钱对我这种人来说可不是问题
Bottom line, money may not be a problem for a guy like me.

347
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,400
这话我没听见
I didn't hear that.

348
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,730
明天下午1点 来我办公室
My office, 1:00 p.m. Tomorrow.

349
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,430
很期待与您合作
I look forward to working with you.

350
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,500
干得好
Nice job.

351
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,700
两个罪犯 同一个精神病医生
Two criminals, same psychiatrist.

352
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,630
我觉得比起客户 她更关心她自己
I think she's looking after herself more than her clientele.

353
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,200
也许她操纵一个客户
It's possible she had a patient

354
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,960
偷了另一个客户的钱
steal from another patient,

355
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,000
但我不明白她怎么办到的
But it's the how of all this that bothers me.

356
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,960
你没法在一个人不知道的情况下
You can't put the idea of a heist in someone's head

357
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,600
把抢劫的主意塞进他脑袋里去
without them knowing about it.

358
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,400
Peter 这没什么奇怪的
Peter, it's not that odd.

359
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,130
在1到10中间挑一个数
Think of a number between one and ten.

360
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,600
不 我讨厌你玩这招
No, I hate it when you do this.

361
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,000
就挑一个数
Just think of a number.

362
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,930
2 3 4 5 随便哪个
Two, three, four, five, whatever.

363
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,360
- 想好了?  - 嗯
- You got it?  - Yup.

364
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,130
现在大声说出来
Now say it out loud in your head.

365
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,700
"7 7 7" 就像这样
"seven, seven, seven," for example.

366
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,700
我就知道你想干嘛 Neal 才不是7
I know what you're doing. It's not seven, Neal.

367
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,630
当然不是 是9
No, it's nine.

368
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,000
好吧 你怎么办到的?
Okay, how did you do that?

369
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,330
在让你挑一个数之前
Before I asked you to think of a number,

370
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,260
我说话时用了 "奇" 字
I used the word "odd" in a sentence.

371
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,660
所以通常来说 你会选一个奇数
So naturally, you'll choose an odd number.

372
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,500
- 接着?  - 接着我通过
- Then?  - Then I made your mind

373
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,960
大声念 "2 3 4 5" 以及 "7"
subtly cross off options by saying

374
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,860
令你无意识地排除了这些选择
"two, three, four, five" and "seven" aloud.

375
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,160
只剩下1和9
Which leaves the numbers one and nine.

376
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,900
而没人会选1的 因为这太显眼
And nobody chooses one because it's too obvious.

377
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,700
9比较不起眼 所以你选了它
Nine is more obscure, so that's what you go with.

378
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,100
很好 但你想说明什么
That's good. Okay, but the point of all this.

379
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,700
在不到20秒的时间里
In less than 20 seconds,

380
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,400
我就让你选了我要的数字
I got you to the number I wanted.

381
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,630
再想想Griffith和Summers
Now think of Griffith and Summers.

382
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,860
有了那么长时间的影响
With that much time and influence,

383
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,330
她定能叫他言听计从
She could make him do anything she wanted.

384
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,430
这人是无辜的
This guy's innocent.

385
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,060
但这些不够 Neal
I need more, Neal.

386
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,430
当你和Summers会面时 找出她或Griffith
When you're with Summers, find something tangible

387
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,100
与Jacoby的钱有联系的具体证据
that links her or Griffith to Jacoby's cash.

388
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,460
那你呢?
What are you gonna do?

389
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,600
我拿到了Shane Jacoby的工作地址
I've got Shane Jacoby's work address.

390
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,130
我去看看能否找到他和Niteowl控股公司
I'm gonna go down there and see if I can find a connection

391
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,800
之间的关系
between him and Niteowl Holdings.

392
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,660
Neal 要当心
Neal, be careful.

393
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,460
我可不想这个精神病医生入侵你的头脑
I do not want this therapist getting inside your head.

394
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,830
拜托 我的头脑坚不可摧
Please. I'm a wall.

395
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,030
真的?
Really?

396
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,130
告诉我 你想要
Tell me, what kind of change

397
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,830
改变生活的哪个方面?
are you looking to make with your life?

398
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,700
大概是想恢复正常吧
I guess I'm looking for some normalcy.

399
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,000
谢谢
Thank you.

400
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,830
那如果这不可能呢?
And what if that's not possible?

401
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,630
听起来不怎么鼓励人啊
That doesn't sound very encouraging.

402
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,200
我不是来鼓励你的
I'm not here to encourage you.

403
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,760
我是来帮助你发掘
I'm here to help you discover

404
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,230
真正的自我 这样你才能接受它
the truth about yourself, so you can accept it.

405
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,400
接受自己无法恢复正常的事实?
I have to accept that I can't be normal?

406
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,400
你太有意思了 以至于无法变得正常
You're too interesting to be normal.

407
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,060
什么让我变得有意思?
What makes me so interesting?

408
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,060
你那永远要成为房间里
Your pathological assumption that you need to be

409
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,000
最聪明的人的病理假设
the smartest person in the room at all times.

410
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,900
或许你才是做出假设的人
Maybe you're the one assuming things.

411
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,500
就满墙的证书而言
According to all these diplomas on your wall,

412
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,760
你比我聪明多了 不过话说回来
you're a lot smarter than me, but then again,

413
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,760
那些只是一纸空文 而非实际能力
those are just papers, not people.

414
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,930
你觉得你擅长和人打交道吗?
Do you think you're good with people?

415
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,360
- 比不上你  - 这是我的工作
- No more than you.  - It's my job.

416
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:30,030
也是我的
Mine too.

417
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,500
你的手段很强势
You have an aggressive approach.

418
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,130
而你已经开始防守了
And you're already withholding.

419
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,830
但这很正常
But that's natural.

420
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,730
我们需要更多地互相了解 以建立信任
We need to know one another better to build trust.

421
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,300
你觉得我不够诚实?
You don't think I'm being honest?

422
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,100
不够
Not yet.

423
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,700
但你会的
But you will be.

424
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,600
迟早的事
In time.

425
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,260
Jacoby先生!
Mr. Jacoby!

426
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,000
Peter Burke 联邦调查局的
Peter Burke, FBI.

427
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,800
你想要什么?
What do you want?

428
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,700
我想和你谈谈
I'd like to talk to you

429
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,130
你在Kaplan安保公司的金库
regarding your vault at Kaplan Security.

430
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600
我不知道你在说什么
Don't know what you're talking about.

431
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,160
好吧 那就换个说法
Okay, let's try that again.

432
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,500
今年9月4日你在哪里?
Where were you on september 4th of this year?

433
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,330
纽约警局想把货车的事归在我头上
NYPD tried to pin that truck on me.

434
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,930
但他们没有证据 你也一样
They had nothing. Same as you.

435
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,400
好吧 好吧 别激动
All right, all right, calm down.

436
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,660
我不喜欢被指控
I don't like accusations.

437
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,960
那你就不该犯罪
Well, then you shouldn't be a criminal.

438
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,000
我尤其不喜欢说我犯罪这个指控
I especially don't like that accusation.

439
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,200
这不是指控 这是事实
It's not an accusation. It's a fact.

440
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,130
我看了你的警方档案 加重伤害罪
Read your rap sheet. Aggravated assault.

441
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
你打断了一个保安的鼻子
You busted the nose of a security guard

442
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,200
以及三根手指
and three of his fingers.

443
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,000
我不再是那样的人了
That's not who I am anymore.

444
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,500
和我讲讲Niteowl控股公司
Tell me about Niteowl Holdings.

445
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,230
也没听说过
Never heard of that either.

446
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,760
你找错人了 Burke探员
You're talking to the wrong guy, Agent Burke.

447
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,130
值得怀疑 不过最后一个问题
Well, that's doubtful, but one more question.

448
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,160
法院指定你和Mara Summers医生间的愤怒管理课程
How did those court-ordered anger management sessions go

449
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,560
进行得如何了?
with Dr. Mara Summers?

450
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,430
要么找点来由把我关进去 要么就让我走
Either take me in on something, or let me get on with my day.

451
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,660
帽子不错
Nice hat.

452
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,100
你读过布鲁克林寄宿高中
You went to Brooklyn residential high.

453
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,230
玩什么体育项目?
What sport did you play?

454
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,360
摔跤 完了没有?
All state in wrestling. Are we done?

455
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,560
唔 没呢
Mm, not quite,

456
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,760
不过你可以走了 Jacoby先生
but you can get on with your day now, Mr. Jacoby.

457
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,000
哦 你知道吗? Kaplan安保公司的金库
Oh, you know that vault that was in Kaplan Security,

458
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,930
就是那个装了200万现金的?
the one with the $2 million cash in it?

459
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,130
它已经空了
It's all gone now.

460
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,400
不过你肯定知道了
But you knew that.

461
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,700
或者你不知道
Or you didn't know that.

462
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,800
好了 现在你知道了 祝你今天愉快
Well, now you do. Have a good day.

463
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,360
- 工作  - 受限制
- Job.  - Confined.

464
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,930
- 嫉妒  - 软弱
- Jealousy.  - Weak.

465
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,130
- 金钱  - 支撑
- Money.  - Prop.

466
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,500
- 女人  - 希望
- Women.  - Hope.

467
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,560
- Peter  - 杰出
- Peter.  - Worthy.

468
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,360
- 偷窃  - 胜任
- Theft.  - Capable.

469
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,330
- 被捕  - 糟了
- Caught.  - Oops.

470
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,230
你得出什么结论了吗?
You make something from that?

471
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,260
下诊断还太早
It's too early to diagnose.

472
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,300
但你还是有了点想法
But you've got something.

473
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,660
你的回答总体来说很有意思
Your answers are unique in summation.

474
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,560
我保证我能应付 医生
I assure you I can handle it, doctor.

475
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,200
你的行为具有反社会倾向
Your behavior is sociopathic.

476
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,360
什么?
I'm sorry?

477
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,260
你专注于观察他人
You work on perception, the perception of others.

478
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,930
体会他们的感受
How you think they'll feel.

479
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,560
这对你行为和思维的影响
This influences your actions and thoughts

480
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,460
远远大于你自身情绪的影响
more so than your own emotions.

481
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,660
欺诈与操纵是紊乱的
Deceit and manipulation are the essential characteristics

482
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,630
两大特质... 而你二者兼备
of the disorder... You excel at both.

483
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,830
欺诈与操纵适用于
Deceit and manipulation are generalities

484
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,500
任何一个说谎者
that can apply to anyone who lies,

485
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,360
而任何人都会说谎 包括你 Summers医生
And everyone lies, including you, Dr. Summers.

486
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,630
或许是的
That may be true,

487
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,760
但并非所有人都能相信自己的谎言
but not everyone believes their own lies.

488
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,030
我为什么要欺骗自己?
Why would I delude myself?

489
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,800
因为你不希望别人看到你的弱点
Because you don't want anyone to see your vulnerabilities.

490
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,600
你不觉得我自信
I don't strike you as confident.

491
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,860
自信的人会承认缺点
Confident people admit to their flaws.

492
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,200
而你不会
You don't.

493
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,100
你只是一笑了之
Instead you smile a lot.

494
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,360
你很自信 那你的缺点是什么?
You're confident. What are your flaws?

495
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,560
我可以很强势 这你之前就提到了
I can be aggressive, like you pointed out earlier.

496
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,330
紧张时我会抠指甲
I also pick at my nails when I get nervous.

497
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,860
没有人是完美的
Nobody's perfect.

498
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,500
确实
Precisely.

499
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,200
一个人越是追求完美
The harder a person fights to be perfect,

500
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,930
就越是压抑本我
the more he suppresses his true nature.

501
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,730
我...
I'm...

502
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,730
我已经改变了
I'm reformed.

503
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,200
真的吗?
Are you?

504
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,460
一个人开始做好事
Just because a person starts doing good things

505
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,700
并不意味着就不做坏事了
doesn't mean he wants to stop doing bad things.

506
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,130
当然不是
Of course not.

507
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,960
因为每个人在人生的某一时刻
Because everyone has done something bad

508
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,500
都做过坏事 哪怕你也是
at some point in their life, even you.

509
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,030
现在说的不是我
This is not about me.

510
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,730
我觉得骗子都能承认自己的缺点
I thought confident people could admit to their flaws.

511
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,660
- 你在扯开话题...  - 你也是
- You're redirecting...  - So are you.

512
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,930
因为你感觉不舒服
Because you're uncomfortable.

513
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,630
你不认为我能改变
You don't think that I can change.

514
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,960
我是在问 你是否想改变
I'm asking if you really want to.

515
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,000
抱歉 我感觉不舒服
I'm sorry. I don't feel well.

516
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,060
我说过 试着放松点
Like I said, try to relax.

517
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,830
我还要问你几个问题
I have a few more questions for you.

518
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,700
怎么回事?
What's happening?

519
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,230
我们正在使用一种新的疗法
We're using a new form of therapy.

520
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,000
- 你给我下了药  - 我在帮你
- You drugged me.  - I'm helping you.

521
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,730
我在帮你
I'm helping you.

522
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,460
我只要你跟我说真话
What I want is for you to simply tell me the truth

523
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,030
你是谁 是做什么的
about who you are, what you really do,

524
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,360
为什么要来这儿
and why you're really here.

525
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:44,030
你准备好 我们就开始吧
I am ready to begin when you are.

526
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,300
嘿 Neal
Neal?

527
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,060
你没事吧?
You okay?

528
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,860
怎么回事?
What happened?

529
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:06,030
我们用了催眠技术
We began to practice hypnotherapy technique.

530
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,600
你睡了好一会儿了
You were out for quite some time.

531
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,060
你醒不过来
You had trouble waking.

532
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,100
真的吗?
Are you sure?

533
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,160
也许你该吃点东西
Perhaps you could use something to eat

534
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,330
或者喝杯水
or a glass of water.

535
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,400
不用 我得走了
No, I should go.

536
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,960
要我帮你叫辆出租车吗?
Would you like me to call you a cab?

537
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,160
不 不用
No. No.

538
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,100
我没事
I'm fine.

539
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,230
- Peter  - 进来
- Peter.  - Yeah.

540
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,700
在布鲁克林居民档案馆找到这个
Got this from Brooklyn residential's archives.

541
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,030
Jacoby毕业那年的
The year Jacoby graduated.

542
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,560
就是他
That's him.

543
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,130
这是赢了全美摔跤比赛的猫头鹰队
That's the team that won All State. The Owls.

544
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,330
我一看到帽子就认出了这个吉祥物
I remembered the mascot when I saw his hat.

545
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,730
猫头鹰队夺冠那一年
Championship year for the Owls,

546
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,300
队长就是Shane Jacoby

547
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,430
他以攻击性的击倒
Known for his aggressive takedowns

548
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,600
以及深夜训练出名
and late-night practices,

549
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,960
于是有了"夜猫头鹰"的昵称
earning him the nickname the Night Owl.

550
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,260
这就是他和Niteowl控股公司的联系
And there is our link to Niteowl Holdings.

551
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:57,300
打电话给纽约警局 把这位怀旧的朋友带来问话
Call NYPD, have our nostalgic friend brought in.

552
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,330
听着挺不错的
Sounds good.

553
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,500
Summers识破我了
Summers is onto me.

554
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,900
你在说什么? 怎么盯上的?
What are you talking about? How?

555
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,660
我不知道 但她给我下药了
I don't know, but she dosed me with something.

556
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,630
她想办法让我开口 我根本不记得自己说了什么
She got me to talk, I can't even remember what I said to her.

557
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,900
我晕过去了
I passed out.

558
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
你知道是什么药吗?
Do you know what it was?

559
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,160
我完全不知道
No, I have no idea.

560
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,530
她肯定是掺进了我喝的水里
She must've slipped it into my water.

561
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,160
好吧 我们得尽快让你做一个毒样检查
Okay, we're gonna get you a tox screen ASAP.

562
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,400
Peter 如果有结果
Peter, if that's the case,

563
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,030
我们就有足够的证据立刻逮捕Summers
we have enough to arrest Summers right now.

564
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,030
如果我们现在逮捕她 很有可能就没法
If we bring her in now, there's a good chance we won't

565
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,560
找回她偷走的钱 就还不了Griffith清白
find the money she stole. Griffith won't be cleared.

566
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:24,130
Griffith 她就是这么识破你的
Griffith. That's how she made you.

567
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,030
没错 我又见了Summers医生
Yeah, I saw Dr. Summers again.

568
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,600
你告诉她我是个联邦调查局探员
And you told her I was an FBI agent.

569
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,560
没错 还说了他是个顾问
Yeah, and he was a consultant.

570
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,100
你有什么目的?
What are you up to?

571
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,200
没目的
Nothing.

572
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,060
听着 我不知道你们在调查她
Look, I didn't know you were investigating her.

573
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,560
我怎么可能知道?
How could I have known?

574
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,400
听着 发生了那么多事 我必须找个人谈谈
Look, I had to talk to someone after everything that happened.

575
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,760
Jacoby不在他的住所和其它常去的地方
Jacoby's not at his residence or any known location.

576
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,400
看来他藏起来了
Looks like he went off-grid.

577
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,930
我们得去追踪他了
We're gonna have to track him down.

578
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,100
听着... 我不是故意把事情弄成这样的
Look, I... I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

579
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,860
你来这里 就是做了正确的事
Look, you did the right thing coming here.

580
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,530
只不过现在出了问题
Only after the fact.

581
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,400
如果我没法改变呢?
What if I can't change?

582
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,630
如果我这辈子就注定...
What if I can't be anything more than...

583
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,430
是个罪犯呢?
a criminal?

584
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,930
晚安 灰姑娘
Good night, Cinderella.

585
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,260
什么?
What?

586
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,800
是种药 叫"晚安 灰姑娘"
Oh, it's a drug. Good night, Cinderella.

587
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,360
很有可能就是Summers给你下的药
It's most likely what Summers spiked your drink with.

588
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,430
在里约工作的女孩子很喜欢用
Very popular with the working girls of Rio.

589
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,000
我听说的
I've heard stories.

590
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,400
你是听说的 还是试过了?
You've heard them or have them?

591
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,160
这有区别吗?
What's the difference?

592
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:43,100
区别就在于你一直在用我的毛巾
The difference is you've been using my towels.

593
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,900
你在我冰箱里放了什么?
What did you put in my fridge?

594
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,930
我做了Hongeo
Oh, I made some Hongeo.

595
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,700
- 能拿出来吗?  - 这是道美食
- Can you please unmake it?  - It's a delicacy.

596
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,600
这是条腐烂的韩国鱼
It's rotted Korean skate fish.

597
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,800
配韩国泡菜和米酒最合适
Fantastic with, um, kimchi and rice wine.

598
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,200
我以为你想尝尝的
I thought you'd like some.

599
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,730
好吧 如果你还想住这儿
All right, if you are gonna live here,

600
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,200
就别再做菜了
you can no longer cook here.

601
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,760
你是在嫉妒我优越的味蕾吗?
Jealous of my refined palate?

602
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,160
我怀疑你还有没有味蕾
I am surprised that one even exists.

603
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,360
接着说"晚安 灰姑娘"
Good night, Cinderella. You were saying.

604
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:11,330
这药混合了γ-羟丁酸 氯胺酮和氟甲硝基安定
Oh, it's a combination of GHB, ketamine, and flunitrazepam.

605
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,400
那些姑娘喜欢给客人下药
The girls give it to their johns,

606
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,930
在药效期间 他们就会言听计从
and then they do whatever they want while under the influence.

607
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,230
他们会把钱都交出来
Empty out their bank accounts,

608
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,200
把车钥匙拱手让人
hand them the keys to their car.

609
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,300
大多数人第二天根本不记得发生了什么
Next day, most guys don't recall anything happening.

610
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,130
他们只会将这个归结为玩得太过火了
They just chalk it up to having too much fun.

611
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,160
你觉得Summers知道这些吗?
And you think Summers knows about this?

612
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,700
学药理学的就都知道
Well, anything's possible with pharmacology.

613
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,230
她是个精神病医生
She's a psychiatrist.

614
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,360
在这个领域是有学位的
She does have a degree in the field.

615
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:35,900
她在治疗很多所谓的罪犯
She's working with so many so-called criminals,

616
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,760
完全可以学会一两招
she could've picked up a trick or two.

617
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,560
我得弄清楚都告诉她什么
I need to find out what I told her.

618
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,960
我可能什么都说了
I could've told her everything.

619
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,500
不仅仅是这个案子的事情
And not just about this case.

620
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,460
万一我跟她说了Hagen的事怎么办?
What if I said something about Hagen?

621
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,000
- 或者是Siegel的事?  - 有个办法能弄清楚
- Or Siegel?  - There's a way to find out.

622
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,700
RMT疗法
RMT.

623
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,500
- 寻回记忆疗法  - 你了解多少?
- Recovered memory therapy.  - What do you know about it?

624
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,230
很简单
It's simple.

625
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,900
我喝多酒之后 就会忘事儿
I drink too much wine, I forget things.

626
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,960
为了想起那些事情 我就再多喝点酒
In order to remember them, I drink more wine.

627
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,360
我知道你的确是这么干的
I'm sure you do.

628
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:03,760
为了寻回记忆 通常情况下最有效的办法
To recover a memory, it's often most effective

629
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,500
就是重新创造出和失去记忆时
to recreate the conditions one was experiencing

630
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,030
完全一样的状态
at the time of that memory's loss.

631
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,360
所以你想说
So what you're saying

632
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,000
我得回那鬼地方一次?
is I need to go back down the rabbit hole?

633
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,160
听着 就算我打算用这个办法
Look, even if I were gonna consider this,

634
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,830
你能在大街上找到这种药吗?
would you be able to find this stuff on the street?

635
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,960
不 当然找不到
No, of course not.

636
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,400
我得帮你配一剂
I'd have to make it for you.

637
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:28,000
你确定这就是Summers用的配方?
You're sure this is the exact combination that Summers used?

638
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,530
非常确定
Mm, pretty sure.

639
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,530
人生中的必然之一
One of the few certainties in life

640
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,760
就是要躲开那些一尘不变的人
is that persons of certainty should certainly be avoided.

641
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,860
这可没让我放心
That does not make me feel better.

642
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,660
好吧 我的确调整了配方
Okay, I made a few modifications.

643
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,630
我添加了一种温和的兴奋剂 用来延迟你的视觉
I added a mild stimulant to prolong your vision quest.

644
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,000
很好
Great.

645
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,530
你在变化状态中清醒的时间越久
The more time you spend awake in this altered state,

646
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,000
我们的成功几率就越大
the better our chances of success.

647
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,030
不会有副作用
And there are no lasting effects.

648
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,700
没有 事实上
No, in fact you'll be

649
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,930
你可以完全控制自己
in complete control of your faculties,

650
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,200
这得归功于我添加的钾兴奋剂
Thanks to my added Potassium stimulant.

651
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,400
只要结束后我能醒得过来就好
As long as I wake up when it's over.

652
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,400
Neal 你不会有事的
Neal, you'll be fine.

653
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,260
我就是你的夏尔巴向导
I am your sherpa guide.

654
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,100
是你将要投身的
Your spirit animal

655
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,500
正常奇幻之旅的精神向导
for this fantastic voyage you're about to embark upon.

656
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,760
相信我 这就是解决办法
Trust me. This is the solution.

657
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,330
晚安 灰姑娘
Boa noite Cinderela.

658
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,830
回忆一下那间办公室
Remember the office.

659
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,600
形状 质感 摆设
The shapes, the textures, the view.

660
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,900
Summers医生就坐在你对面
Dr. Summers is sitting across from you.

661
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,030
她在等着你失去意识
She's waiting for you to lose your inhibitions.

662
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,060
她说了什么?
What is she saying?

663
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,160
你准备好 我们就开始吧
I'm ready to begin when you are.

664
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,960
深呼吸 保持冷静
Take a deep breath, and stay calm.

665
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:50,630
镇定剂药效过了之后 你不会记得自己说了什么
You won't remember what you tell me once the narcotic wears off.

666
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,560
她有没有问你问题?
Did she ask you any questions?

667
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,530
问了 她想...
Yeah, she wanted...

668
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,560
她想要...
she wanted to...

669
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,760
联邦调查局都知道了什么?
What does the FBI know?

670
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,760
什么都知道了
Everything.

671
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,100
那他们有什么证据?
What can the FBI prove?

672
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,260
什么都证明不了
Ah. Nothing.

673
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,930
你问了她问题吗?
Did you ask her any questions?

674
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,400
问了
Yeah.

675
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,400
你投了两百万 为什么?
You stole the 2 million. Why?

676
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,130
和你偷艺术品的动机一样
For the same reason you steal.

677
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,930
因为就摆在你面前
Because it was there.

678
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,860
这方法肯定没用
This isn't gonna work.

679
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,600
- 我没法好好思考  - 这就是关键
- I can't think straight.  - That's exactly the point.

680
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,630
要换种角度思考
Think circular.

681
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,660
不 我是说Summers
No, I mean Summers.

682
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,800
她说得没错 我没有变
She was right. I'm not reformed.

683
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,700
我是说 我喜欢现在的工作
I mean, I like doing the things I do.

684
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,300
我喜欢和Peter一起工作
You know, I like working with Peter,

685
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,560
也喜欢和联邦调查局合作
I like working with the FBI.

686
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,800
好吧 这就是迷药在发挥作用
Okay, that's simply the drugs talking.

687
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,260
但我也喜欢跟他们对着干
But I also like working against 'em.

688
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,960
我喜欢做不应该做的事情 而且也不觉得愧疚
I like doing things I shouldn't, and I don't feel guilty,

689
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:57,060
不会自责 没有其它任何感觉除了...
I don't feel remorse, I don't feel anything except...

690
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,560
好吧 看来兴奋剂加多了
Okay, too much stimulant.

691
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,930
也许你也应该喝点这个药
Maybe you should take some of the solution too.

692
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,960
没错 这可以让你想起来
Yeah, it could help you remember.

693
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,730
- 想起什么?  - 真正的你
- Remember what?  - Who you are.

694
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,560
你在这里做什么 Moz?
What are you doing here, Moz?

695
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,330
你应该在外面重建自己的生活
You should be out on the streets rebuilding yourself.

696
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,800
你很聪明 人缘又广
You are smart, you are resourceful.

697
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,630
只要没有身高要求的事情 你都能办得到
You can do anything without a height requirement.

698
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,930
这没那么简单
It isn't so easy.

699
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,200
难道警察终于把你逼到角落 打趴你了吗?
Has big brother really finally just cornered you into defeat?

700
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,560
我去拿纸笔 把这些都写下来
I'm gonna get a pen and write some of this down for research.

701
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,460
去吧
Go.

702
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,560
好了 我们接着...
Okay, we should take it fr...

703
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,560
不
Oh, no.

704
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,000
- Burkes  - 是Neal啊
- Burkes.  - Neal.

705
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,100
有什么事儿吗?
What are you doing here?

706
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,400
没
No.

707
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,330
只是有些话不说憋着难受
I just came to get some stuff off my chest.

708
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,860
我才七年级的时候 还什么都不懂
I was in seventh grade, I didn't know any better,

709
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,830
但是看到那钞票从她的包里伸出来一小截
but the money was sticking out of her purse,

710
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,520
"啵" 就成我的了
and boop, mine.

711
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,390
跟在伯利兹偷伽利多那副自画像如出一辙
It was the same thing with the Garrido self-portrait in Belize.

712
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,620
当然没有从钱包里抽出来那么容易
I mean, I wasn't taking that out of a purse.

713
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:21,920
那边其实是美国古董总中心
It was more like a highly secured wing

714
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,490
戒备异常森严的一侧
of a Central American Antiquities Center.

715
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,790
我是不是有点话痨?
Am I talking too much?

716
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,020
- 他没事吧?  - 一头雾水
- Is he okay?  - I have no idea.

717
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,090
我在做实验
I am conducting an experiment.

718
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,260
试着回忆
I am trying to remember

719
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,020
我当时跟Summers都说了些什么...
what I said to Summers when I was under...

720
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,020
这边真热
It's hot in here.

721
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,560
你干了什么?
What did you do?

722
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,920
我跟Mozzie说了 他给了我一剂药
I talked to Mozzie, and he gave me a solution,

723
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,690
我喝了下去
and I drank that solution.

724
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,990
我没听懂
I don't understand. 

725
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,990
他在一个什么可笑的实验里给自己下了药
He drugged himself in some ridiculous experiment

726
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,620
来再现他都跟那个精神病医生说了什么
to recreate what he said to the psychiatrist.

727
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:51,920
Neal 你饿不饿?
Neal, are you hungry?

728
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,690
你看起来需要吃点东西
You look like you could use something to eat.

729
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,260
我现在倒是不饿
I'm actually not hungry right now,

730
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,790
不过要是有你做的那种美味菜鸡
but if you have any of those fantastic game hens you make,

731
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,060
我可以一会儿吃上一点
maybe later.

732
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,360
不过不要肉饼 我不大喜欢那个
Ooh, no meat loaf, though. I'm not a fan.

733
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,990
宝贝 让我们俩单独待一会儿好吗?
Honey, could you excuse us for a minute?

734
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,920
好的
Yeah.

735
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,690
Neal啊
Neal.

736
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,020
你知道Siegel怎么死的吗?
Do you know what happened to Siegel?

737
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:16,320
你没回答我 Siegel的事
You're not answering my question. Siegel.

738
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:20,360
我不知道怎么回事 而且...
I don't know what happened, and...

739
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,220
你瞒了我什么 Neal?
What aren't you telling me, Neal?

740
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,890
谢天谢地
Oh, good.

741
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,420
就算热爱梭罗
For the love of thoreau,

742
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,420
{\an8}梭罗 美国作家 主张回归自然

743
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,690
你也不能就这么随随便便跑进树林里
you can't simply wander off into the woods like that.

744
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,590
嘿 Moz 你在我屋里干什么呢?
Hey, Moz. What're you doing in my house?

745
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,990
他像个追着断了线的气球的
He ran away like an impudent child

746
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,360
傻小孩儿一样跑出了屋子
chasing after an untethered balloon.

747
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,490
怎么回事?
What happened?

748
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,120
我们做了尝试 而且成功了
We tried something, and it worked.

749
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,960
他开始回忆起部分Summers控制住他的时候
He was starting to remember parts of the conversation

750
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,320
和他的对话了
when Summers had him under.

751
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,160
但你最多只剩大概15分钟了
But you only have about 15 minutes left, at best.

752
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,660
然后他就会睡着了
Then he's gonna want nap time.

753
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,490
好吧 来吧
All right, let's do this.

754
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,290
- Neal  - 嗯
- Neal.  - Yeah.

755
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,420
深呼吸
Take a deep breath.

756
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,720
- 闭眼  - 嗯
- Close your eyes.  - Yeah.

757
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,920
从你断开那里接着往下回忆
Just try to remember where you left off.

758
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,660
联邦调查局都知道了什么?
What does the FBI know?

759
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,960
Summers问我联邦调查局知道了什么
Summers asked me what the FBI knew.

760
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,720
她知道我们什么证据也没有
She realized we have nothing.

761
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:20,020
她接下去问了什么?
What did she ask next?

762
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,290
她问了...
She asked about...

763
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,860
Griffith的事
Griffith.

764
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,590
联邦调查局会起诉他吗?
Will the FBI prosecute?

765
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,020
很快就会的
They will soon.

766
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,820
非常好 Neal
That's good, Neal.

767
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:34,090
保持注意力集中
Stay focused.

768
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,490
然后 她站起身
After that, she stood up.

769
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,190
她去了哪儿?
Where did she go?

770
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,360
打了个电话
To make a phone call.

771
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:47,190
打给谁?
Who did she call?

772
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,460
我看到她打的号码了
I saw the number she dialed.

773
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,560
区号是212
It was a 212 area code.

774
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,420
有三个5...
Three fives...

775
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,290
零 一...
0, 1...

776
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,020
还有两位数字 Neal
Two more digits, Neal.

777
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:06,660
零 一...
0, 1...

778
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,320
八 四
8, 4.

779
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,920
干得漂亮
Nice work.

780
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,720
看看她给谁打的电话
Let's find out who she called.

781
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,860
我是Jacoby 有事请留言
This is Jacoby. Leave a message.

782
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,220
她给Shane Jacoby打的电话
She called Shane Jacoby.

783
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,390
Neal 我们得...
Neal, we're gonna have to...

784
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,960
给你拿床毯子
grab you a blanket.

785
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,460
我带他走
I'll take him.

786
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,360
什么 你要背着他吗?
What, are you gonna carry him?

787
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,890
我要告诉你我做了不少屈腕练习的
I'll have you know I've been doing a lot of wrist curls.

788
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,390
你已经帮了很多忙 我来照顾他吧
You've done plenty. I'll take care of him.

789
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,990
Jones 嘿
Jones. Hey.

790
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,820
我想明天去见Griffith
I want to see Griffith tomorrow,

791
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:40,660
你得跟我一起去
and I'm gonna need you to come with me.

792
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,670
现在不太方便
Now's not really a good time.

793
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,600
不方便也得方便
Make time.

794
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,630
你不认识Shane Jacoby
You don't know Shane Jacoby.

795
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,570
跟你们说过了 我不认识
I told you guys, no, I don't.

796
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,500
他倒是可能认识你
Well, he may know about you.

797
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,470
Summers昨天和他联系过
Summers made contact with him yesterday.

798
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:08,030
我已经把知道的都告诉你们了
I've told you everything that I can.

799
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,270
我... 我真的很抱歉 但你们真的得走了
I'm... I'm really sorry, guys, but you're gonna have to leave.

800
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,030
我得去学校接孩子
I have to pick up my kid from school.

801
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,830
只能追查到底了
Just had to follow up on this.

802
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,970
我们会尽力弄清怎么回事的
We're doing everything we can to figure out what's going on here.

803
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,730
只要你不犯我们
You don't waste our time,

804
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,670
Griffith先生 我们绝不犯你
Mr. Griffith, we won't waste yours.

805
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:40,300
- 我说的都是实话  - 我相信你
- I'm telling you the truth.  - I believe you.

806
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,330
既然你要去接孩子
And I know that you have to see your kid,

807
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,700
那我们就先走了
so we'll be on our way.

808
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:46,030
但要是出了什么事
But if anything should come up,

809
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,230
联系我们就好 听见了吗?
you make sure you call us. You got it?

810
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,070
嗯 嗯 听见了
Yeah, yeah. Got it.

811
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,900
保持联络
We'll be in touch.

812
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:01,270
好了 他们走了
All right, they're gone.

813
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,670
爸爸 怎么回事?
Daddy, what's happening?

814
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,170
没事的 宝贝
It's okay, buddy.

815
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,930
滚开
Back up.

816
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,770
是啊 他会没事的
Yeah, he'll be okay.

817
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:19,100
只要你告诉我你把我的200万藏哪儿去了
As soon as you tell me where you stashed my 2 million.

818
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,300
不然的话...
Otherwise...

819
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,100
不然怎么样?
Otherwise what?

820
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,630
举起双手 立刻放开孩子
You put your hands in the air, and let go of that kid now.

821
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,930
- Peter 你没问题吧?  - 没问题
- Peter, you good?  - Yeah, I'm good.

822
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,070
带他出去
Get him outta here.

823
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,530
记得我说过我们还没完吗?
Remember when I said we weren't done?

824
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,500
现在完了
Now we're done. 

825
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,630
第一个回合
All right, the first time out,

826
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,930
Summers操纵Griffith偷Jacoby的钱
Summers manipulates Griffith to steal from Jacoby.

827
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,500
然后反将一军
Then she turns it around.

828
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,700
让Jacoby去找Griffith
She steers Jacoby towards Griffith.

829
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,030
对于她倒是说得通
Well, it makes sense on her part.

830
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,270
Jacoby去杀Griffith 把自己搞进监狱
Jacoby tries to kill Griffith, lands himself in jail,

831
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,700
而她带着钱安然离去
and she walks with the money.

832
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,000
依然没有指向Summers的
There's still no physical evidence

833
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,670
确凿证据
pointing toward Summers.

834
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,100
只有心智操控
Only psychological manipulation.

835
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,930
我们有什么办法?
What's our best option?

836
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,400
要么把钱找到 但估计藏得很好
Find the money, which is probably well hidden,

837
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,230
要么让Summers招供
or get a confession out of Summers,

838
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,000
这个更不可能了
which is all the more unlikely.

839
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,870
未必
Not necessarily.

840
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,070
总有一剂药可为良方
There's always a solution.

841
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,070
{\an8}此处"solution"双关 既指药剂 又指解决办法

842
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,470
很高兴看到你气色有起色
I'm glad to see you're feeling better.

843
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,930
我对生活有了一种新视角
I got a new perspective on things.

844
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,270
跟我讲讲
Tell me about that.

845
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,800
我承认我不知道
Well, I can admit that I don't know

846
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,830
自己是否能控制本能冲动
if I can control my natural impulses,

847
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,970
但失控并未让我感到无助
but that lack of control doesn't make me feel helpless.

848
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:43,800
那你感到什么?
How does it make you feel, then?

849
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,300
自由
Free.

850
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:49,670
因此你承认你仍旧乐于犯罪
So you admit you still like to commit criminal acts.

851
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,500
事实上 我现在就要犯上一桩
I'm gonna commit one right now, as a matter of fact.

852
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:58,200
钱在哪里?
Where's the money?

853
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,300
你让Griffith偷的那些
The money you had Griffith steal.

854
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,370
你可以接着装傻
You can play dumb

855
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,370
医生 但好景不长的
all you want, Doctor, but it won't last long.

856
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:07,730
药很快就要生效了
The drugs will take effect soon.

857
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,770
不可能
That's not possible.

858
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,570
我拿开了水瓶 自己倒的水
I removed the water bottles and poured it myself.

859
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,100
那你会发现重新塑封瓶盖是多么容易
You'd be surprised how easy it is to reseal a plastic lid.

860
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,430
开始抠指甲了 医生?
Are you picking your fingernails, Doctor?

861
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,700
也就是说你很紧张
'Cause that would mean you're nervous.

862
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,430
- 你紧张吗?  - 你不能这么对我
- Are you nervous?  - You can't do this to me.

863
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,830
告诉我钱在哪
Tell me where the money is.

864
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,030
联邦调查局永远也别想找到
The FBI will never find it.

865
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,970
是啊 他们找不到
No, they won't.

866
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:43,070
但毕竟我可是个罪犯
I am a criminal, after all.

867
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,800
你帮我意识到这点 多谢了 医生
You helped me realize that, so thank you, Doctor.

868
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:52,400
我需要的只是...
All I need from you...

869
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,830
招供
is a confession.

870
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,500
你准备好 我们就开始吧
I'm ready to begin when you are.

871
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,680
Mara Summers医生 现在以
Dr. Mara Summers, you're under arrest

872
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,640
盗窃 私藏违禁药物以及渎职罪逮捕你
for theft, possession of illegal narcotics, and malpractice.

873
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,940
有证据吗?
On the basis of what?

874
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,080
你的招供
Your confession.

875
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,440
我知道Shane Jacoby偷了钱
I knew Shane Jacoby stole that money.

876
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,310
那个白痴额头上就跟
Idiot may as well have had "guilty"

877
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,210
烙着"有罪"俩字儿似的
tattooed across his forehead.

878
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,910
我跟踪他到他藏钱的金库
I followed him to the vault where he hid the cash.

879
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,580
这是非法的 你们对我下药了
This isn't legal. You drugged me.

880
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,580
我想你说的是你不小心对自己下了药
I think you mean you accidentally drugged yourself.

881
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,540
我们要对你做一个毒样检查
We're gonna do a tox screen on you that's probably gonna match

882
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:41,240
结果可能跟你给Neal下的毒完全一样
the unprescribed cocktail you dosed Neal with at his session.

883
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,480
而你再次试图对我下药时 Peter会提出
And in trying to drug me again, Peter's going with

884
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,910
你可能不小心换错了瓶子
the theory that you made the mistake of switching bottles,

885
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,680
害了自己
inadvertently harming yourself.

886
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,440
差不多是这样 带她走
That sounds about right. Take her.

887
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:53,910
女士
Ma'am.

888
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,210
你应该知道你永远
You do understand you'll never be

889
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,840
也跳不出罪犯的圈子了
anything more than what you are.

890
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,840
但至少我是自由的
But at least I'm free.

891
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:03,880
我就能跟你说这么多了
Which is more than I can say for you.

892
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,110
跟我走
Come with me.

893
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,410
就这样? 我清白了?
So that's it? I'm in the clear?

894
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,510
由于你当时所处的精神状态
The Bureau is not pressing any charges

895
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,480
联邦调查局不打算起诉你
due to the psychological duress you were under at the time.

896
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:25,040
谢谢你
Thank you.

897
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,740
- 谢谢你  - 没事 应该的
- Thank you.  - Yeah, of course.

898
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:29,910
不 不 多谢你告诉我 我们这种人
No, no, thank you for showing me that guys like us

899
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,580
也能有所改变
can be more than what we were.

900
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,680
好运
Good luck.

901
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,840
看来他感觉好多了
Seems like he's feeling better.

902
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,640
是啊 你呢?
Yeah. How about you?

903
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,180
再次结案的感觉如何?
How does it feel to close a case again?

904
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,640
我不确定是否算结案
I'm not so sure the case is closed.

905
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:59,040
Summers终于肯松口告诉我们她把200万藏哪里了
Summers cracked and told us where she hid the $2 million,

906
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:03,210
但我们去找的时候却没找到
but when we went to retrieve it, it wasn't there.

907
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,980
至少我们弄到了她的招供
Hmm, good thing we got a confession.

908
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,880
你是说这个归我了?
You're telling me I can have this?

909
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,980
把它当作我那天晚上
Consider it an apology

910
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,580
对你说的话的道歉吧
for all the things I said the other night.

911
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,210
忠言逆耳而已
They were things I needed to hear.

912
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,540
是时候重建帝国了 老朋友
It's time to rebuild the empire, my friend.

913
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,780
友情提醒 钞票做了标记
Word of caution. The bills are marked.

914
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,440
每一美元我还是可以换来50美分的 仍是一笔不错的收获
I can get 50 cents on the dollar. Still a pretty good haul.

915
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,880
我还以为小菜一碟呢
I figured it wouldn't be a problem.

916
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,720
这是从你自己直系猫咪探长
This is illegally obtained contraband from one

917
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:46,390
手上的案子里非法搞来的
of your very own suit's Federal investigations.

918
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:49,290
你为什么要拿?
So why'd you take it?

919
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:52,490
因为它就在那儿
Because it was there.

920
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,620
总有一天我要找到合适的说法
One day I'll find the right words,

921
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,120
一定要言简意赅
and they will be simple.

922
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,850
- 凯鲁亚克说的  - 没错
- Kerouac.  - Yeah.

923
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,290
不能更言简意赅了
Can't get much simpler than that.

924
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,190
对于咱们这样的来说就不是了
Not for guys like us.

925
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:05,850
咱们这样的? 你要回归老日子了?
Guys like us? You coming back to the life?

926
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,450
那你第一步如何打算?
So what's your first plan of action?

927
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,120
改变战局
Change the state of play.

928
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,550
我有太多主子了
I've been serving too many masters.

929
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:14,790
我受够了当每个人的玩偶
I'm through being everyone's puppet.

930
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,890
Hagen 联邦调查局...
Hagen, the FBI...

931
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:20,450
你到底计划脱离哪一方呢?
Which strings, exactly, do you plan on cutting?

932
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,230
一旦时机成熟...
When the time comes...

933
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,170
统统再见
all of them.
