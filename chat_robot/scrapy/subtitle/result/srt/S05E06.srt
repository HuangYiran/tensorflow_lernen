1
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:03,901
罗德尼  你可以说了
You can go ahead, rodney.

2
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:05,234
我不知道该从哪讲起好
I don't remember where to start.

3
00:00:05,234 --> 00:00:06,400
你能行的
Sure you do.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,434
不
No.

5
00:00:07,434 --> 00:00:08,534
从自报姓名说起吧
Start with your name

6
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:09,801
就像我们以前做过那样
Like we've been doing, okay,

7
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,033
我们现在就从你名字开始
And we'll just go from there.

8
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:13,334
我的名字
My name...

9
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:16,267
我是
My name is...

10
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:17,467
罗德尼·麦凯先生
Mr. rodney mckay.

11
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:18,601
说错了
No...

12
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,701
没有
Yes.

13
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:20,701
加油  再想想
Come on, now.

14
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:22,501
你是麦凯博士  记得吗
You're dr. mckay, remember?

15
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:24,801
不  我不是博士了
No, I'm-- I'm not anymore.

16
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:28,834
我再也不聪明了
I'm not s-s-smart anymore.

17
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:32,334
博士是很聪明的  我现在只能是先生了
Doctors are smart, so I'm mister now.

18
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:34,234
好吧
Okay.

19
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:38,801
我以前是最聪明的人
I used to be the smartest person ever...

20
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:42,167
而  现在  我不是了
And-- and now... now I'm not.

21
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,133
所以我们现在正努力治好你
That's what we're trying to fix, right?

22
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:46,501
不  不  你们治不好我的
No. no, you can't fix me.

23
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:48,267
你知道我们正全力想办法
You know we're trying our very best--

24
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:49,901
不  你们治不好的
No, you can't.

25
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:50,968
治不好的  治不好的
You can't. can't--

26
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,200
罗德尼  好好  我们治不好
It's okay, rodney,

27
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,767
接下来你该说什么
What's the next thing you're supposed to say?

28
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:55,734
约翰在哪里
Where... where did john go?

29
00:00:55,734 --> 00:00:56,801
他有事得离开几分钟
He just had to go away for a few minutes.

30
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:57,801
他会马上回来的
He'll be back--

31
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:58,968
约翰
John!

32
00:00:58,968 --> 00:01:00,400
罗德尼   罗德尼  我是你的好朋友
Rodney... rodney, I'm your friend,

33
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,567
我在这陪你
I'm right here.

34
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:03,634
约翰  你在哪
Where are you, john?

35
00:01:03,634 --> 00:01:04,901
约翰!
John!

36
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:12,400
你们怎么不早告诉我  我哥哥病得这么厉害
Why the hell didn't you tell me my brother was this far gone?

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,234
吉妮  这一切发生的太突然了
It's happened pretty fast, jeannie.

38
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:16,033
不  我...
No, i...

39
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:18,601
几个星期前我还收到他的信息
I got a message from him just a couple of weeks ago.

40
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:20,767
他   他看起来还很健康
He... he seemed perfectly fine.

41
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:22,934
他从来没有这么"客气"过
He'd never been so nice.

42
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:24,200
在他被感染后不久
That would have been

43
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,334
就这样了
Shortly after he became infected.

44
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:29,467
我没有及时发现症状
I didn't recognize the symptoms in time.

45
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:30,667
大夫  这不是你的错
It's not your fault, doc.

46
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:33,868
米勒夫人  坦白的说
Frankly, mrs. miller, we contacted you

47
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:35,267
我们一发现病症的严重性
As soon as we became aware

48
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:37,567
就第一时间联系你了
Of the seriousness of his condition.

49
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:38,934
事实上  当代达罗斯号将你送到
In fact,  daedalus dropped you off

50
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:40,667
飞马座第一个星门时
At the first available gate in pegasus

51
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:41,934
我们还担心
Because we were concerned

52
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:44,033
你可能会来不及赶到这儿
That you wouldn't make it here in time.

53
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:48,667
我们认为应该给你机会
We thought you deserved a chance

54
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:51,267
和你哥哥说再见
To say goodbye.

55
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,868
凯勒医生正在和你哥讲
Dr. keller wanted to take a moment

56
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:10,734
说你要过来看他
To prepare him for your visit.

57
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:12,300
好的
Yeah, i, uh...

58
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,901
我也需要几分钟来冷静一下
I think I need a moment myself.

59
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:18,534
他是怎么得上这病的
How did... how did this happen to him?

60
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:21,167
在执行上一个任务时
Um, there was a little snafu

61
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,734
发了点小问题
On the last mission.

62
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:25,667
谢帕德中校
Colonel sheppard,

63
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:26,734
当你抵达研究营
When you reach the research camp,

64
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:28,167
务必提醒尼克拉斯博士
Please remind dr. nichols

65
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,901
他现在已经...
That he is now...

66
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:33,067
超过预定报道时间1小时15分钟了
One hour and 15 minutes overdue for his scheduled check-in.

67
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:35,501
好的  要帮你扁他一下或什么的
Right, want me to smack him around or anything?

68
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:42,567
只要提醒一下就好  拜托了
Just the reminder, please.

69
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:46,467
我们不用担心一下尼克拉斯的小分队么?
Shouldn't we be concerned for dr. nichols' team?

70
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:48,868
不需要  营地和星门只有半小时的路程
No, the settlement's a half hour away from the gate.

71
00:03:48,868 --> 00:03:50,734
他让他们每6小时和总部联系一次
He's got them checking in every six.

72
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:53,300
我想尼克拉斯一定是满宇宙的跑累了
I'm sure nichols is just tired of taking the round trip.

73
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,567
不管怎么说  他动下手指给总部报个到又不会死
Still, it wouldn't hurt to bust his chops a bit.

74
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,701
那个尼克拉斯太自以为是了
That nichols is so arrogant.

75
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:07,834
艾米利亚  我想在他们回来报到前
Amelia, I think I'm going to risk

76
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:10,801
去下面吃个早餐应该来的及
Heading down to breakfast before they check in.

77
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:12,200
我的意思是
I just mean that...

78
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,133
他们去营地
It will probably take them some time

79
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,868
要花些时间
To get to the camp,

80
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:18,501
之后尼克拉斯回来报到
And then more time

81
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:22,167
应该还会更晚点儿
For nichols to get back to the gate and report.

82
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:24,267
其实我没必要...
There's really no point in my...

83
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:26,734
说给你听的
Telling you this.

84
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,033
是不必要  长官
Not really, sir.

85
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:29,501
好的
Right.

86
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:31,633
20分钟后回来
Be back in 20 minutes.

87
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:37,200
外来突发激活
Unscheduled offworld activation!

88
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,534
展开防护盾
Activate the shield.

89
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:45,534
我收不到虹膜解除码
I'm not receiving an idc.

90
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:47,167
我是谢帕德
This is sheppard.

91
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:48,567
请不要降低防护盾
Do not lower the shield.

92
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,100
不然整个发射塔将被洪水淹没
The entire tower will be flooded.

93
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,868
中校  我们会继续打开防护盾
I have no intention of doing that, colonel.

94
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:53,367
你那现在情况怎样
What's your status?

95
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:54,801
又冷又湿
It's cold and wet.

96
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:56,100
星门没入水下
The stargate's underwater.

97
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,534
整个山谷也被淹没了
The entire valley's flooded.

98
00:04:57,534 --> 00:04:59,200
我快冻死了
And it's freezing!

99
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,634
我们急需一艘飞船过来
We need you to send a jumper through

100
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,501
好让我们取暖烘干直到洪水退去
So we can stay warm and dry until the water recedes.

101
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:06,901
马上就到  中校  坚持住
Will do, colonel, hold on.

102
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:07,767
已经在坚持了
Holding on.

103
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,433
谢帕德汇报完毕
Sheppard out.

104
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:19,067
救援1号就位
Rescue one is standing by.

105
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,701
怎么这么久
What's taking so long?

106
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:24,434
为什么星门会罢工
Why isn't the gate disengaging?

107
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:28,534
是因为这些水
It's the water.

108
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:30,901
恒压迫使虫洞保持在活跃的状态
The constant pressure's forcing the wormhole to stay active,

109
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:32,467
这就是说我们得等到
Which means we're going to have to wait

110
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:33,734
星门所能持续开启的最大时间限度
The maximum amount of time a stargate can stay open.

111
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,367
即38分钟
38 minutes.

112
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:36,767
那好  现在还剩32分钟
Well, we're down to 32,

113
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:37,901
别再说什么"我早就告诉过你了"
And before you say I told you so,

114
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:39,334
我们别无选择
We had no choice.

115
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:40,400
我冻得一直发抖
I can't stop shivering.

116
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,801
热量都让你从嘴巴漏走了
You're letting all the hot air out of your mouth.

117
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,067
好了弟兄们
All right, everybody,

118
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:46,601
我们很快会暖起来的
You'll be warm soon enough.

119
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:49,033
我不知道  我应该湿得比你厉害
I don't know, I think I got wetter than you did.

120
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:50,467
那我不确定
I don't know,

121
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:52,534
去拨号也让我弄潮了
I got a little damp dialing the dhd.

122
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:54,667
研究营在更远一点的山谷里
The research camp was farther up this valley.

123
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:57,133
我有点担心尼克拉斯的小分队了
I'm a little concerned for dr. nichols' team.

124
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:58,267
说的对
Right.

125
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:01,133
研究营里还有人么
Anyone at the research camp,

126
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:02,133
我是谢帕德中校
This is colonel sheppard.

127
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:03,367
请回话
Please respond.

128
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:09,234
重复  我是谢帕德中校
I repeat, this is colonel sheppard.

129
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:10,534
请回话
Please respond.

130
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:11,801
我确定他们都死了
I'm pretty sure they're all dead.

131
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:12,868
我们怎么会知道  罗德尼
We can't know that, rodney.

132
00:06:12,868 --> 00:06:15,734
那些人在研究全球变暖的影响
Look, the research team was studying the effects of global warming.

133
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:18,434
他们把营扎在山谷深处的冰川脚下
They set up camp at the foot of a massive glacier up the valley.

134
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:19,968
你觉得是冰化了么
You think an ice dam broke?

135
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:21,300
有这可能
It fits.

136
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,267
古人不把星门建在这样的冲积平原
The ancients don't put stargates on a flood plain,

137
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,501
我认为也就不会有潮水涌过来
And I certainly don't think the tide just came in.

138
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:28,434
难怪水这么刺骨的
It explains why the water's so freezing.

139
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:33,634
好吧
Aw, okay...

140
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:37,767
我浑身热乎乎的  怎么还是发抖
Okay, so now I'm hot, and I'm still shivering.

141
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:39,601
在我们出来前  你发烧了么
Were you running a fever before we left?

142
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:40,734
我不知道  也许吧
I don't know, maybe.

143
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:41,934
我总是有点什么小毛病
I'm always running something.

144
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:46,367
好吧
All right,

145
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,501
这水貌似退了一点
I think the water's receded a little.

146
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:51,100
难道我们要一整晚困在这儿么
So we're going to be stuck here all night.

147
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,367
会有艘温暖舒适的飞船来接我们的
In the back of a warm, cozy jumper, all right?

148
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:57,067
你要做的就是再坚持
All you need to do is hold on

149
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:59,534
我不知道  大概30分钟吧
For, I don't know, 30 minutes or so...

150
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:13,701
他失去知觉多久了
How long has he been unresponsive?

151
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,100
从他在飞船上睡着开始
Since he fell asleep in the jumper.

152
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,467
大概9个小时
About nine hours.

153
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:17,400
把他送到医务室
Okay, let's get him to the infirmary.

154
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,067
我要做个全身扫描
I want him under a scanner.

155
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:20,334
你们几个我也得检查一下
I want to have a look at you guys, too.

156
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:22,267
我们没事
We're good.

157
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,501
那只是暂时的
By that I mean now.

158
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:26,567
这次事故还是证明了我的提案
I think you've just made a case for my proposal

159
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:29,234
每单任务都得有一个轮式机器人给你们开路
To send a malp ahead of every single transit.

160
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:30,334
这是意外  伍尔希
Stuff happens, woolsey,

161
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:31,334
这意外  我是指...
And by "stuff," I mean--

162
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:33,267
我知道你指什么  谢谢
I know what you mean, thank you.

163
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:35,300
你们怎么没乘自己的飞船回来
Why didn't you return in the jumper I sent you?

164
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,567
我让他们
Well, I ordered the rescue party

165
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,534
继续搜救尼克拉斯的小队
to continue the search of nicolas' team

166
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:40,033
有可能有生还者
There's a chance they're still alive.

167
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:42,067
说的对
Of course.

168
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:43,467
我得去做检查了
I got to go get checked out,

169
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:46,067
然后  去看看罗德尼
And then, uh, I'm going to check on rodney.

170
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:55,133
我们的小伙怎么样了
Well, how's our boy?

171
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:56,501
体温正常  没有过高或过低
No fever, no hypothermia,

172
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:58,000
扫描结果一切正常
Nothing on the scan at all.

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,200
你们怎么样了
How about you guys?

174
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,267
我早说了  我们没事
Like I said, we're good.

175
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:03,534
可是我们都没有昏迷过去
But we're not the ones who became unconscious.

176
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:05,701
可能是因为昨晚没睡好吧
Well, I didn't really get much sleep the night before,

177
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:06,868
加上我没好好吃早餐  所以...
And I did skimp on breakfast, so...

178
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:09,801
知道吗  伍尔希想在每次传送之前都派小机器人
You know, woolsey wants to send out a malp before every transit now.

179
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:11,300
这样可会减少其使用寿命啊
Well, that's going to get old fast.

180
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,801
我也是这么想的
That's what I said.

181
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:14,000
我现在能走了么
Hey, can I go now?

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,100
躺在这儿我都犯困了
I feel a little silly lying here.

183
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,567
你的观察期得久一点
I'm keeping you under observation for a little longer.

184
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:18,834
况且  我都帮你订了晚餐了
Besides, I ordered you dinner.

185
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:19,934
那你还得看着我吃了
Well, then you can observe me eat,

186
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,200
我饿坏了
Because I'm famished.

187
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,567
说真的  他好多了
It's official. he's better.

188
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:23,634
再见
See you guys.

189
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:27,801
我把他们带进来好么
Do you want me to send them in?

190
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:30,300
好的
Okay.

191
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:36,968
罗德尼准备好见你们了
Rodney's all ready for you.

192
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,367
我该说什么好
What am I supposed to say?

193
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:46,767
说什么都不要紧了
Doesn't matter.

194
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:02,767
米尔德斯?
Meredith?

195
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,934
是我  吉妮  米尔  我...
It's me. it's jeannie, mere. I'm--

196
00:09:06,934 --> 00:09:08,667
你是我妹妹
You're my sister.

197
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,267
是的
Yes.

198
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:15,667
米尔德斯是我...真名
Meredith's my... real name.

199
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,367
嗯  是你的名字
It's your first name, that's right,

200
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:20,734
可你一直都不喜欢它
But you never liked it.

201
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,767
是不喜欢
No.

202
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:25,200
是女孩子的名字
No, it's... a girl's name.

203
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,234
有的时候是的
Sometimes, yes,

204
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:33,300
后来你就改成罗德尼了
But you go by rodney.

205
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,467
罗德尼·麦凯
Rodney mckay,

206
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:38,133
罗德尼·麦凯
Mr. rodney mckay.

207
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:40,067
罗德尼·麦凯  罗德尼·麦凯
Rodney mckay, rodney mckay...

208
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:47,901
你是因为我哭的
You're crying because of me.

209
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:52,300
我哭是因为我非常想你
No, I'm crying because I've missed you very much.

210
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,400
因为你是我妹妹
'cause you're my sister.

211
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,067
是的
That's right.

212
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:00,667
我...
I'm...

213
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,734
生病了
Sick.

214
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,701
我知道
I know.

215
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:06,801
我知道
I know.

216
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:07,868
所以我来了
I'm here now.

217
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,968
我
I...

218
00:10:12,968 --> 00:10:15,267
宝贝  我出去一下好吗
Sweetie, I just need to go outside for one second, okay?

219
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:16,734
马上回来
I will be right back,

220
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:18,834
我保证
I promise.

221
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,167
我知道
I know.

222
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:28,501
给我点时间
I just need a second.

223
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:30,300
我不想让他看到这样子
I just don't want him to see.

224
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,634
你的心情  我感同身受
I know how you feel.

225
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:32,734
因为我也一样
I felt the same way.

226
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:34,567
我会回去的  我会的
I'll go back in, I will.

227
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,400
他需要我  我要跟他道别
He needs me, and I want to be able to say goodbye,

228
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,566
但好像...
But it's like...

229
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:39,033
他已经弃我而去了
It's like he's already gone.

230
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:41,234
我知道
I know.

231
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:43,500
我有个法子
There's a way.

232
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,033
什么  什么办法
What? how?

233
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:49,033
有个地方  我曾经去过
There's a place. I've been there before.

234
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:51,067
他能在那里恢复记忆  这样你就能跟他道别
He'll be himself again, and you can say goodbye.

235
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:53,634
我不太明白
I don't understand,

236
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:54,901
那你怎么还不带他去
Then why haven't you already taken him?

237
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:57,033
因为这太危险了
Because it's dangerous,

238
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:59,133
如果你希望的话  我乐意冒这个险
But I'm willing to risk it if you are.

239
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:06,901
准备好了么
All set?

240
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:10,068
别忘了提醒我投诉出这馊主意的人
Remind me to register a complaint with whose ever idea this was.

241
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:12,001
这可是你的事儿
It was yours, actually.

242
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:16,100
投诉已经立案了
Well, complaint duly registered.

243
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,834
让你这突如袭来的不测
It was a good idea to keep a record

244
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,267
永载史册  真是个好主意啊
Of what's happening to you and how fast,

245
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:20,300
不过如果你不愿这样--
But if you'd rather not--

246
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,367
没事儿  这样很好
No, it's fine. it's fine.

247
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:22,400
记下我的名字呢  对吧
store My name, right?

248
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,601
对
Right.

249
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:25,968
我还能记得一些事情
Hey, I remembered something. yay!

250
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:27,300
我是罗德尼·麦凯博士
My name is dr. rodney mckay.

251
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,701
亚特兰蒂斯科学什么部门的头儿
I'm head of the department of science something in atlantis

252
00:11:30,701 --> 00:11:35,434
在...
In the,

253
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:37,701
老天啊...
Oh, for god's sake...

254
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:38,968
在飞马座星系...
In the pegasus galaxy.

255
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:41,567
很好  继续说下去
Okay, not bad, keep going.

256
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,934
珍妮弗  有些...
Jennifer, there's...

257
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:47,001
有些东西我想  呃...
There's something I wanted to, um...

258
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:49,634
在我记得  还能记得的时候
You know, while I remember, while I still can,

259
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:52,167
我想说...
Something I wanted to say...

260
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:53,701
继续
Go ahead.

261
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:58,734
吉妮
Jeannie, uh...

262
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:01,434
真没想到这么晚还会有人来
I wasn't expecting anyone this late.

263
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:02,767
是啊  我是那种
Yeah, I'm kind of one of those people

264
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:05,834
对一切必要信息都不肯放过的人
Who needs all the information they can get.

265
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,334
这是他最近一次的头部扫描
This is his most recent scan.

266
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:13,467
这些看上去像肿瘤的暗色区域
This dark area that looks like a tumor

267
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,701
实际上是一些寄生物
Is actually a parasitic organism.

268
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:17,901
它的须蔓已经蔓延
Its tendrils spread

269
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:20,133
利用手术抽离根本无望
Far beyond any hope of surgical extraction,

270
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:22,634
而且任何疗法对其也毫无效果
And it's not responding to treatment.

271
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:25,001
即使是抑制状态也很难减缓其蔓延速度
Even stasis barely slowed its progression.

272
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:27,467
还有很多的混合药物...
There are still a number of drug combinations that--

273
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:29,834
他是在上次任务中被感染的?
He was infected somehow on his last mission?

274
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,133
有可能
Well, maybe,

275
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:32,834
但也说不定
But not necessarily.

276
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:35,968
当时这生物还太小无法在图像上显现
It was too small to show up on a scan at the time,

277
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:38,001
但在飞马座星系
But in the pegasus galaxy,

278
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:41,934
这种情况在年长的人中很常见
The condition is fairly common among the very old.

279
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:44,367
好吧  那为什么是他?
Right, so why him?

280
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:47,801
很有可能我们都接触过它  但是机体排斥掉了
It's possible we're all exposed to it,and fight it off.

281
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:50,952
罗德尼在m44 5y9执行任务时
Rodney was already suffering from a viral infection

282
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:53,034
就已经被毒菌感染了
when he went on the mission at m44 5y9,

283
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:55,777
之后又长时间浸泡在冰水中--
And then all that time in freezing water--

284
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:56,934
因此他的抵抗力很差
So his resistance was low.

285
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:03,867
这种寄生虫并不像是杀死细胞以供其休眠
The parasite doesn't so much as kill cells as render them dormant

286
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:07,968
其原因我依然没有完全弄明白
For reasons I still don't completely understand,

287
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:11,200
但最终结果会导致大脑功能不断衰退
But the net result is ever-diminishing brain function.

288
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,367
随着它不断蔓延
As it spreads,

289
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:14,001
他将失去行动控制能力
He'll lose motor control,

290
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,901
器官功能紊乱--
Regulation of organ function--

291
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:18,867
若楠的人管这种病叫"老年痴呆"
Ronon's people call the disease "second childhood."

292
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,334
你跟若楠谈过?
You talked to ronon.

293
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,467
是的
Yes.

294
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,068
好吧  我知道他会告诉你些什么
Okay, I know what he's told you.

295
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:26,683
他说罗德尼快死了  你对此无能为力
That he's dying, and there's nothing you can do.

296
00:13:26,683 --> 00:13:30,300
不  他是要死了  但我将尽我所能帮他
No, he's dying, and I'm doing everything I can.

297
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,601
那我问你...
I have to ask you...

298
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:35,867
你为什么说你没有及时确诊
Why did you tell me you didn't recognize the symptoms in time?

299
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:39,100
他执行任务回来以后
Because he was already showing the symptoms

300
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,634
就已经表现出症状
When he came back from the mission, and...

301
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:44,233
但我都没有见到
I didn't see it.

302
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:46,701
感觉怎么样
So?

303
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,901
乖乖听医生的安排
Just what the doctor ordered.

304
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:49,834
你可真幽默
Funny.

305
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:51,334
来点什锦水果么?
You want my fruit cup?

306
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:52,434
不  不  不
No, no, no.

307
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:53,968
口是心非啊
I think you do.

308
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:55,200
吃病人的东西
Eating from the patient's tray

309
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,734
会引起别人不满的
Is kind of frowned upon.

310
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:58,334
珍妮弗  我们这是在约会
Jennifer, we practically dated.

311
00:13:58,334 --> 00:13:59,968
你就请我喝了东西  这可跟约会差远了
You bought me one drink. that's hardly dating.

312
00:13:59,968 --> 00:14:02,001
好吧  那如果我现在请你跟我共进晚餐呢
Right, so now I'm asking you to have dinner with me.

313
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:03,901
我的意思是  比如这个
I mean, such as it is.

314
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:08,534
我的确挺喜欢什锦水果
I do love the fruit cup.

315
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:10,500
这可不是我想的那种晚餐  不过...
Not that this is exactly the dinner I had in mind, but...

316
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,834
你在邀请我?
Is that an invitation?

317
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:14,068
你得先答应
Only if you promise to accept.

318
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:20,467
如果不是因为被新的罗德尼·麦凯所打动
If I wasn't so taken by the new rodney mckay,

319
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:22,801
我就能在这些寄生物还小的时候做手术了
The parasite might've been small enough for me to operate

320
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:25,567
也就不会严重到这个地步了
Without causing significant brain trauma.

321
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:29,334
到他出现失忆的时候已经太迟了
By the time he started to forget, it was too late.

322
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:35,133
不过我还没放弃寻找治疗方法
I haven't given up on trying to find a treatment--

323
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:39,767
若楠告诉我一个地方  能让他在死前暂时清醒的
Ronon told me about this place that could give mere one more day as himself again before he dies.

324
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:42,200
吉妮  你不能相信...
Jeannie, you can't possibly believe--

325
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,467
你也不想让他去那里?
And that you're the one who won't let him go.

326
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,734
在一个被称为塔勒斯的星球上
It's on a planet called talus.

327
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:49,434
那是一个先人的原始星球
It's one of the original worlds of the ancestors.

328
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:52,333
大概需要五到六个小时就能到那里通过星门
It took us about five or six hours to get there From the gate

329
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:52,801
我那时还只是个孩子
but I was just a kid,

330
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:55,867
我祖父带我走过大半的路程
And my grandfather had to be carried most of the way.

331
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:57,800
现在只要花一半的时间就能到那里
We could do it in about half that time.

332
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,200
唯一的问题就是
There's a small problem with that plan.

333
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,801
复制人战争的时候  幽灵族在那里有个大型的前哨基地
The wraith established a major outpost there,during the replicator war.

334
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:06,334
现在还在
It's still there.

335
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:09,534
那可挡不住我们去想去的地方
Yeah, well, that's never stopped us from going anywhere we needed to go before.

336
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,434
事实上  并不是仅此而已
Well, it's not just that.

337
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:13,867
你在怀疑他的真实性
You don't believe it's real.

338
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:14,901
我可没这么说--
I'm not saying--

339
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:16,068
我很怀疑
I am, actually.

340
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:17,901
我去过那里
I was there.

341
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:19,367
但你当时只有六岁
Yes, but you were six years old.

342
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:22,667
若楠  想想你告诉我们的
Ronon, listen to what you've told us--

343
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:23,901
一个魔幻的圣地
A magical shrine,

344
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:25,801
在一个瀑布后面的山洞里
Inside a cave, behind a waterfall--

345
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:27,334
我有说过是魔幻的么?
Did I say it was magic?

346
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:31,100
是没有  但你说那些跟麦凯有相同症状的人
No, but you did say that people afflicted with mckay's condition

347
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,068
突然恢复记忆
Suddenly revert to their former selves for...

348
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:39,400
很多有这症状的我的族人都知道塔勒斯圣地
The shrine of talus is also known among my people for victims of the second childhood.

349
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,267
去那的人都有一天时间恢复正常
It offers the gift of one last day,

350
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:43,601
然后迅速死亡
And a quick death.

351
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:46,133
那也不能说明它的确存在
That doesn't necessarily make it real.

352
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,300
我再次告诉你们
I'm telling you that in a matter of seconds

353
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,233
我见证了我的祖父  从个不知道自己名字的人
I saw my grandfather go from someone who couldn't speak his own name,

354
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:53,334
变成了个教我追踪打猎的人
To the man that taught me how to track and hunt.

355
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,501
你六岁的时候就学习打猎?
You learned to hunt when you were six years old?

356
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:03,001
突然有一天
For one day,

357
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:04,734
他抱着他的妻子
He got to hold his wife in his arms,

358
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:06,767
然后与他爱的人共进一餐
And share a meal with the people that he loved,

359
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,233
接着光荣地死去了
And then he died with honor.

360
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,701
你可以认为我当时太小记不住
You can say I was too young to remember,

361
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:12,467
但我知道我看到了什么
But I know what I saw,

362
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,667
并且现在我们可以为麦凯做同样的事
And we can do the same thing for mckay.

363
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:20,434
你要是觉得这不值得
If you think that's not worth it,

364
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:21,834
你就错了
You're wrong.

365
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:32,801
我从没对外人提过这件事情
I've never told anyone this,outside of...

366
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:36,100
我父亲得了老年痴呆
My father had a disease called alzheimer's.

367
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,400
这跟麦凯博士的病症很像
It's similar in many respects to the condition that dr. mckay is suffering from.

368
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,068
我的意思是...
My point is,

369
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:46,334
跟你刚才说的一致
I had a similar moment with him to the one you just described.

370
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:50,068
几个月过去了  他已经认不出我是谁了
He hadn't recognized me, literally, for months,

371
00:16:50,068 --> 00:16:53,267
直到有一天  很突然的
Then one day, out of the blue,

372
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:56,133
他突然对一切重新恢复记忆
He had a moment of absolute clarity.

373
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:59,867
他对我说"理查,你在这里干嘛呢?"
He said "richard, what are you doing here?"

374
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:07,100
然后我对他说"爸,我...我来看你"
And I said, "dad, i, uh,I'm here to see you,"

375
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,567
然后他说...
And he said...

376
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:14,300
他说"那岂不是好极了?"
He said, "isn't that wonderful,"

377
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,100
然后他又再一次陷入以往的状态
And then he was gone again.

378
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:19,734
你难道记不起一点类似的...
Now, couldn't you be remembering a similar--

379
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:20,834
那可不一样
It's not the same.

380
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:21,801
若楠
Ronon, look--

381
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:23,200
我欠他的!
I owe him this!

382
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,416
我自己带他去
I'll take it myself.

383
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:27,233
我跟你一块
I'll go with him.

384
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:28,867
等等  等等
Hold on, hold on.

385
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:32,233
都知道我们只有两艘母船
We know for a fact there are two hive ships

386
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:34,133
而地面上有大概10,000幽灵族
And 10,000 wraith on the ground.

387
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:37,367
要是不得不这样做的话  好吧
If we're even going to consider this, all right,

388
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:40,034
我们得先制定个计划
We have to make a plan.

389
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:41,467
好吧  制定你的计划
Fine, make your plan.

390
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:44,034
抱歉各位  没有我的允许他哪儿也不能去
I'm sorry, but he's not going anywhere without my permission,

391
00:17:44,034 --> 00:17:48,867
而等我们和罗德尼谈过以后再做决定
And you won't get that until we talk to rodney.

392
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,867
还好吧  罗德尼
Hey, rodney...

393
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:01,100
有人来看你了
You got some visitors.

394
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,068
约翰来了
John's here.

395
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:04,801
还有泰勒跟若楠
So are teyla and ronon.

396
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:07,167
全队都到了
The whole team.

397
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:08,500
若楠·德克斯
Ronon dex.

398
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,601
没错  伙计
That's right, buddy.

399
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:12,001
我想带你去个地方
I want to take you to a place,

400
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:15,734
在那儿你能短时间恢复记忆
A place that's going to give you a chance to be yourself again for a little while.

401
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,001
回到你生病之前那样
As you were before you became ill.

402
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,267
之前?
Before...

403
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,034
嘿  老兄
Hey, pal.

404
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:36,567
约翰
Hey, j-john.

405
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:40,534
事实上  我们不...知道你身上将发生什么事
Truth is, we don't... know exactly what's going to happen to you,

406
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:44,034
但如果你愿意的话我们会全力帮助你
But we're willing to try, if you are.

407
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:45,867
没问题
Okay.

408
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:47,334
你同意了
Okay.

409
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,601
那  安顿好他  然后
Okay, well, that settles it, then.

410
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:51,233
不行  还不行
No, it doesn't.

411
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:54,334
罗德尼  他们没告诉你全部细节
Rodney, they haven't told you everything.

412
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:55,434
他没必要知道
He doesn't need to know.

413
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,100
他们想要带你去的那个行星
The planet they want to take you to

414
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,467
是个幽灵族的前哨基地
Is a wraith outpost.

415
00:18:58,467 --> 00:18:59,934
你还记得什么是幽灵族么
You remember who the wraith are?

416
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:03,801
你要是去的话  会非常非常危险
It means going will be very,very dangerous,

417
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:06,867
不仅是对你而言  还有你的朋友
Not just for you, but for your friends.

418
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:08,701
我们乐意冒这个险
We're willing to take that risk.

419
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:10,967
为了什么去冒这个险
A risk for which, and I'm sorry--

420
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:14,767
就算有用  这点我还是怀疑...
even if it works,Which I very much doubt--

421
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:20,034
总有一天你会好起来的
You might revert to your former self for one day.

422
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:23,601
原谅我这种语气  听起来很不吉利
Now, forgive me if that sounds more like torture than a blessing.

423
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:26,900
我们一直在想尽办法处理这个问题
We're still coming up with new ideas on how to treat this thing,

424
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,300
但是如果你这坚持这么做
But if you do this,

425
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,400
坚持离开亚特兰蒂斯
if you leave atlantis...

426
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,534
亚特兰蒂斯...
Atlantis...

427
00:19:33,534 --> 00:19:35,534
这一切就完了
It's over.

428
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:38,701
我就帮不上你了
I can't help you.

429
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,934
大夫
Doctor...

430
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:52,400
他根本就不明白
He doesn't understand.

431
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,434
你错了  他明白
No, he doesn't,

432
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:58,534
他去留的决定权在我这儿
Which means the decision on whether or not to let him go is mine,

433
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:03,501
我绝不会放弃我的病人
And I haven't given up on trying to cure my patient.

434
00:20:13,267 --> 00:20:15,133
你还是不放弃啊
And you still haven't given up .

435
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:16,834
不  因为我不认为
No, because I don't think

436
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:18,734
这些细胞上的损伤是永久性的
The damage to the cells is permanent,

437
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:19,801
这就意味着
Which means

438
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,100
只要我能成功地移除寄生虫...
If I can to safely remove the parasite--

439
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,634
你已经花了多长时间在这上面
How long have you been at it?

440
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:24,367
好几周了吧?
Weeks?

441
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:25,867
可是他还能撑几天
And how many days does he have left?

442
00:20:25,867 --> 00:20:28,634
最多两天不是吗
Two at most?

443
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:31,267
我知道你尽力了
Look, I know you've done everything you can.

444
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:33,100
我知道你觉得这是你的责任
I know you feel responsible,

445
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,500
你一直在努力寻找解决的办法  可是...
And you want to keep trying, but...

446
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,233
我是他的近亲
I'm his next of kin.

447
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:38,767
所以还是按我的决定吧
That makes the decision mine.

448
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:41,467
我们要带他去
and we're taking him

449
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:48,201
正在录了
It's recording.

450
00:20:49,201 --> 00:20:50,767
难道你不说"开拍"之类的么
Well, aren't you supposed to say, "action" or something?

451
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:51,934
不好意思啦
Oh, sorry.

452
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:53,234
说笑而已
I'm kidding.

453
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:56,900
我们开始吧
Okay, here we go.

454
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,733
我的名字是罗德尼·麦凯博士
My name is dr. rodney mckay.

455
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:02,134
在飞马座星系  亚特兰蒂斯里
I am head of the science and research departments

456
00:21:02,134 --> 00:21:04,668
我是负责科学研究部门的
Here in atlantis, in the pegasus galaxy,

457
00:21:04,668 --> 00:21:06,501
在目前的这片地方
In the local cluster,

458
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:09,034
甚至我们所认识的宇宙
In the universe as we know it.

459
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,201
录制这个日志是为了
The purpose of this log

460
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:14,067
给我自己  也给凯勒医生
Is to provide a baseline for myself,

461
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,833
提供一份资料
And for dr. keller,

462
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:19,301
用来关注我的进展  关于我的...
To monitor the progress of my, um...

463
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,668
失忆
Memory loss.

464
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:26,267
很搞笑  对吧
Ironic, isn't it?

465
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:28,733
先从复述前面提到的开始
By reciting the aforementioned,

466
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:30,034
同时再列举一些事情
As well as a list of things

467
00:21:30,034 --> 00:21:31,568
那些我了如指掌的信息
I know like the back of my hand,

468
00:21:31,568 --> 00:21:35,668
那么从圆周率开始吧  精确到小数点后的第12位
Starting with pi, to, say, 12 decimals.

469
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:39,034
3.1415926535...
3.1415926535...

470
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,034
罗德尼在船上么
Rodney on board?

471
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,034
是的
Yes.

472
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:44,534
我们之前达成的协议没有异议吧
Are we clear on the rules of engagement?

473
00:21:44,534 --> 00:21:46,700
我们的行动不会让幽灵人发现的
We'll get in and get out before the wraith even know it.

474
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,434
谢帕德中校
Colonel sheppard,

475
00:21:48,434 --> 00:21:52,800
如果麦凯确实恢复了记忆
If in fact dr. mckay does regain his...

476
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,501
替我跟他道个别
Say goodbye for me.

477
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:04,401
我以为你不相信
I thought you didn't believe.

478
00:22:04,401 --> 00:22:06,000
那是先决条件?
Is that a prerequisite?

479
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:12,467
你能来他很高兴
He'll be glad you're here.

480
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:17,501
好吧  搞定这件事  要么能成  要么就不成
All right, we're either going to get away with this, or we're not.

481
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:18,967
要是不成  这趟旅程应该会很辛苦
If we don't, the ride's going to wild,

482
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:21,301
而且速度很快  大家要有所准备
And it's is going to be fast, so I need everyone prepared.

483
00:22:21,301 --> 00:22:22,501
3号飞船
Jumper three,

484
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:23,967
准备就位
Standing by.

485
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,501
先送辆轮式小机器人吧
Send the malp through.

486
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,601
它们已经帮你们清除了了障碍物
The malp is clear of the gate,

487
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:41,401
并且向两旁开火
And they're firing on it from both sides

488
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,467
看起来是个深山谷
Of what appears to be a deep valley.

489
00:22:45,434 --> 00:22:46,833
它们正在制造烟雾罩
It's deploying smoke.

490
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,900
使这片地区隐形5秒钟
You should have complete coverage of the area in five seconds.

491
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,700
好的  明天见
Okay, see you tomorrow.

492
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,367
但愿如此
I hope so.

493
00:23:12,668 --> 00:23:14,568
这山谷真骇人啊
That's one hell of a valley.

494
00:23:14,568 --> 00:23:17,467
能赶在他们探测到我们之前就隐形起来么
Do you think they detected us before we were able to cloak?

495
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:18,900
应该可以  烟雾罩应该起作用了
No, I think the smokescreen worked.

496
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,201
但愿他们认为
Hopefully they think

497
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:22,201
我们是派了个机器人开路
We just sent a malp through ahead of us

498
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:23,967
然后他们把它炸掉了就能震慑我们
And changed our mind when they blew it up.

499
00:23:28,134 --> 00:23:30,401
我要扫描一下着陆点了
All right, I'm going to do a sweep of the landing area.

500
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:33,134
花不了几分钟
Shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

501
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:36,501
约翰  约翰!
John, john!

502
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,234
约翰!
John!

503
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:49,601
约翰!
John!

504
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:51,267
约翰!
John!

505
00:23:51,267 --> 00:23:52,668
你就在那  然后他...
You were there, and-and then he--

506
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:54,167
罗德尼  罗德尼  我在这儿呢  出什么事了
Rodney, rodney, I'm right here. what's wrong?

507
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,733
我醒过来  大家都走了
I woke up, everyone had left!

508
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,867
兄弟  我...
Buddy, i...

509
00:23:58,867 --> 00:24:01,601
抱歉  我以为你睡着了
I'm sorry, I thought you'd fallen asleep.

510
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:04,267
我...
I was...

511
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:06,167
我怕极了  我很肯定...
I got so scared, I was sure that...

512
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:08,700
一到早上我残存的意识一定会消失殆尽的
By the morning what was left of my mind was going to be gone!

513
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,100
我送你回房间好么
I'm going to take you back to your quarters, okay?

514
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,700
约翰  我从没这么害怕过
John... john, I've never been so scared.

515
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,767
我抓不住了
I'm slipping away.

516
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:15,067
它要溜走了
I'm slipping away,

517
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:16,034
我不知道怎么办
And I don't know how to stop myself!

518
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:17,434
看  你还在这里啊
Look, you're still here.

519
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:19,034
没事的
All right?

520
00:24:19,034 --> 00:24:20,134
你还在这里啊
You're still here.

521
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:25,167
对啊  我是啊
Yeah. I am.

522
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:29,934
而我也还在这里啊
And I'm not going anywhere.

523
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:32,634
如果你想出去逛逛  那就...
You know, you want to hang out, you just...

524
00:24:32,634 --> 00:24:34,167
出去逛逛
Hang out.

525
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:35,367
我不知道要做什么
I don't know what to do.

526
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:37,867
我不知道该拿自己怎么办
I don't know what to do with myself.

527
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:39,867
我...
I'm...

528
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:41,467
对不起  我不该吵醒你
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have woken you up.

529
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:44,867
没关系  看外面夜色多美妙
All right, look, it's a nice night out.

530
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:46,634
我们去码头上喝些啤酒吧
Let's go have some beer on the pier, okay?

531
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:50,900
我会喝酒?
I drink beer?

532
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,367
非常能喝
A lot.

533
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:55,034
拿着这个
Take this.

534
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,434
快点呀  兄弟  我们走!
Come on, buddy, let's go.

535
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:08,267
我不清楚  我能再喝一瓶吗
I don't know, should I have another?

536
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:10,034
喝了也无妨
What could happen?

537
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,234
我不该那样砸你的门
I shouldn't have banged on your door like that.

538
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:15,634
感觉好荒唐
I feel ridiculous.

539
00:25:15,634 --> 00:25:17,300
不要这么想
Don't.

540
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:21,601
我一直在想
I've been trying to remember the name

541
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:24,334
我侄儿的名字
Of my sister's kid.

542
00:25:25,534 --> 00:25:27,234
贝蒂
Betty.

543
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,833
贝蒂...
Betty...

544
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:33,034
我敢保证肯定不是这个
Pretty sure that's not it.

545
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:35,733
It's madison. see?

546
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,201
至少你能想起来什么不是了
At least you remembered what it wasn't.

547
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:38,301
这只是下下策
Oh, there's an underrated skill.

548
00:25:38,301 --> 00:25:40,367
我只是说  也许没有你想象的那么糟糕啊
I'm just saying you may not be as far gone as you think.

549
00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:42,501
我在掩饰了
I'm hiding it.

550
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:43,767
真的  我已经忘记了很多东西
Believe me, I've already forgotten more

551
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:44,967
比大家所能想象的要多得多
Than most people will ever know,

552
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:47,767
我知道这听起来很...
And I know that sounds...

553
00:25:47,767 --> 00:25:48,900
自大  对吧
Arrogant, is that right?

554
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,367
嗯
Yeah.

555
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:53,234
是这样
That works.

556
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:56,668
早上我在帮泽兰卡弄一个装置
This morning I was trying to help zelenka finish a device

557
00:25:56,668 --> 00:25:58,100
那本来是我想出来的
That was apparently my idea.

558
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,568
我没用了
I was useless.

559
00:26:01,868 --> 00:26:03,833
珍妮弗说我还会继续恶化
Jennifer says it's going to get worse now

560
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:06,800
再一个小时最多
Almost by the hour.

561
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,267
差不多一周以后
In a week or so,

562
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:12,434
我甚至记不住我自己的名字
I won't even remember my name.

563
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:17,100
这样吧...
How's about...

564
00:26:19,634 --> 00:26:22,733
我们现在就说再见吧
How about we say goodbye now?

565
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:24,867
不要
No.

566
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:25,934
你说不要是什么意思
What do you mean, no?

567
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:27,234
我是说  我不要说再见
I mean, I'm not saying goodbye.

568
00:26:27,234 --> 00:26:28,401
反正我会说的
Well, I'm saying it anyway.

569
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:29,334
那我就当没听见
I'm not listening.

570
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:31,334
可是很快我就会不知道你是谁了啊
Yeah, but pretty soon I won't even know who you are.

571
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:32,334
那我会提醒你
Then I'll remind you.

572
00:26:32,334 --> 00:26:33,668
可是我不希望你看到我那个样子
But I don't want you to see me like that.

573
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:34,833
我想让你记住我现在的样子
I want you to remember me as I am,

574
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:35,967
一个天才  而不是什么...
As your genius friend, not as some --

575
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:37,067
不可能
Not happening.

576
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:38,100
拜托了嘛
Please.

577
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,501
你别和我争了  罗德尼
You're stuck with me, rodney.

578
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:40,601
面对现实吧
Just accept it.

579
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:41,634
可是...
Yeah, but--

580
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:42,900
没有可是!
No!

581
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,100
就这样!
That's final.

582
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:50,800
好吧
Okay.

583
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,501
好吧
Okay.

584
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:04,267
你真是个好朋友
You're a good friend, arthur.

585
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,367
着陆点没有发现问题
All right, landing area's clear.

586
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:29,401
我们准备进入了
I'm taking us in.

587
00:27:44,301 --> 00:27:45,833
我们是要去哪
Where are we going?

588
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,501
那儿  看到了吗
Up there, do you see?

589
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,000
瀑布后面  那有个洞
Behind the waterfall, there is a cave,

590
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,833
当我们到了那
And when we get there, you will spend

591
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,833
你就可以和朋友们在一起了
A wonderful day with your friends.

592
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:54,167
可我很累
I'm tired.

593
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:55,367
我知道
I know.

594
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:57,401
我们很快就到了
We'll be there soon.

595
00:28:31,467 --> 00:28:33,534
然后呢  我们怎么办
So... what do we do?

596
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:34,967
等
We wait.

597
00:28:34,967 --> 00:28:36,167
罗德尼
Rodney...

598
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:37,401
看这瀑布
Look at the waterfall.

599
00:28:37,401 --> 00:28:38,434
很棒对吧
It's cool, huh?

600
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:39,534
一点也不
No.

601
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:43,900
能量读数很弱了
I'm getting very faint energy readings.

602
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,134
哪种的能量读数
What kind of energy readings?

603
00:28:45,134 --> 00:28:46,134
我不确定
I'm not sure.

604
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,201
看看这个
Look at this.

605
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:50,601
放射物?
Radiation?

606
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:52,601
我从没见过这种的
Not that I've ever seen.

607
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:54,367
说不定可以问下罗德尼
Maybe we can ask rodney in a minute.

608
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:55,601
约翰!
John!

609
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:56,833
撑着点  兄弟
Just hang in there, buddy.

610
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:57,934
我要回家!
I want to go home now!

611
00:28:57,934 --> 00:28:59,967
或许他得靠得再近一点这个图
Perhaps he should stand closer to this tablet.

612
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,267
我不知道
I-- I don't know.

613
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:03,267
这应该是能量读数的来源点了
I think that's the source of these energy readings.

614
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:04,867
我现在就要回去!
I want to go now!

615
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:06,034
就再一下下就好
A little bit longer.

616
00:29:06,034 --> 00:29:07,534
我要回去!
Go now!

617
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:20,467
吉妮?
Jeannie?

618
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,434
我在这  米尔
I'm here, mere.

619
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:27,267
这很明显嘛
Yeah, obviously.

620
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:29,800
他回来了
He's back.

621
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,467
谁来告诉我下
Somebody please tell me

622
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:34,067
见鬼了我们在这里干吗
What the hell we're all doing here?

623
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,789
罗德尼·麦凯
rodney mckay

624
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:41,089
我是科学和...  和...
i'm head of science and... and ...

625
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:46,889
研究
research

626
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,589
-没关系的  -很有关系!
- it's ok. - No,it's not!

627
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:54,800
亚特兰蒂斯
atlantis...

628
00:29:57,534 --> 00:29:58,700
飞马座
Pegasus...

629
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:03,901
3.14...
It's 3.1...4...

630
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:08,433
我不知道
I don't know.

631
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:12,134
我怎么可能不知道
How can I not know that?

632
00:30:12,134 --> 00:30:14,067
要不要先停一会儿
Do you want to stop?

633
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:18,700
当我一闭上眼
I keep seeing a face.

634
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:22,101
我的眼前总有张脸在晃动
Every time I close my eyes.

635
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:27,400
我想那应该是我妈妈
I think it's my mother.

636
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:32,867
我...  我不...
I don't-- I don't...

637
00:30:32,867 --> 00:30:35,867
我认不出她来了...那是很早以前的事了
R-recognize her... it's so long ago.

638
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:42,934
她一直在说着什么
She's saying words to me...

639
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,867
可是我不知道她在说什么
I don't know them.

640
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,801
那你们想从这个鬼地方开始?
Well, you can start with, what is this place?

641
00:30:55,801 --> 00:30:57,567
这里是塔勒斯的圣地
It's the shrine of talus.

642
00:30:57,567 --> 00:30:59,367
那对我来说什么都不是
That means nothing to me.

643
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:00,467
这是先人的星球
It's a planet of the ancestors.

644
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:01,300
所以我们带你来了这里
We brought you here.

645
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,867
谢谢啊  全知先生
Thank you, mr. information.

646
00:31:02,867 --> 00:31:04,667
若楠什么时候学会解释了
Since when did he become ronon the explainer,

647
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:05,967
而且我怎么不在医务室里
And why am I not in the infirmary, huh?

648
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:08,333
我好转了?
What am i, better?

649
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,600
我是好多了
I am better!

650
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,001
并没有的
No, you're not.

651
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:12,433
有啊  我感觉到了  真是太神奇了
I am. I can feel it. this is amazing!

652
00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:14,134
我们把你带到这儿来
Mere, we brought you here

653
00:31:14,134 --> 00:31:16,734
是为了我们能有个机会跟你说再见
So we could have a chance to say goodbye to each other,

654
00:31:16,934 --> 00:31:19,600
你这样的状态也就差不多持续1天
But you're only going to feel like this for about a day.

655
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,700
因为规律就是这样
That's just how it works.

656
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,901
什么什么什么?!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. what?

657
00:31:23,634 --> 00:31:25,834
你记得吗
What do you remember?

658
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:28,300
我记得你不让我说再见的
I remember you not wanting me to say goodbye then.

659
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,634
可是现在唱的又是哪一出
Why now all of a sudden?

660
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:30,834
还有  什么只有一天
Look, and why one day?

661
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:31,901
那又是什么
What's with that?

662
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:33,234
这是圣地的魔力
It is a gift of the shrine,

663
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:36,234
我们冒着危险把你带到这儿来
And from all of us who risked great danger to bring you here,

664
00:31:36,234 --> 00:31:38,400
也给你最后一个机会  和你爱的人们在一起
One last chance to be with those you love.

665
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
然后呢
And then what?

666
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,700
我就要死了吗
I die?

667
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,634
光荣地
With honor.

668
00:31:45,634 --> 00:31:46,734
带着尊严
And dignity.

669
00:31:46,734 --> 00:31:48,300
去他的  那我就一直呆在这
Screw that, I'll just stay here.

670
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,333
没有用的
Doesn't work that way.

671
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:51,234
为什么
Why not?

672
00:31:51,234 --> 00:31:52,967
这个星球是幽灵人控制的
One, this is a wraith-controlled planet.

673
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:54,700
而且我们也探测到
And we're detecting

674
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,168
电离辐射
Ionizing radiation.

675
00:31:56,168 --> 00:31:57,934
实际上我们也不应该站得这么近...
In fact, we shouldn't be standing this close to the--

676
00:31:57,934 --> 00:31:58,901
你们在开什么玩笑
You've got to be kidding me.

677
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:00,700
你怎么能让他们这么对我
How could you let them do this to me?

678
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,168
不能怪她
Don't blame her.

679
00:32:02,168 --> 00:32:03,067
她也不想这么做的
She didn't even want to do this.

680
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:05,268
那是谁出的这馊主意的
Then whose brilliant idea was it?

681
00:32:05,268 --> 00:32:06,234
我
Mine.

682
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:07,834
我们都认为这是件好事
We all thought it was a good thing--

683
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:10,034
这怎么可能是件好事
How could this possibly be a good thing?

684
00:32:10,034 --> 00:32:11,734
我都放下面子了
Look, I'd got past the humiliation,

685
00:32:11,734 --> 00:32:13,534
跟你们一一道别
I've said my goodbyes.

686
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:15,067
我很遗憾你发生了这样的事
Meredith, I'm sorry this happened to you,

687
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,967
可是对于这个机会我不后悔
But I'm not sorry that I got this chance.

688
00:32:16,967 --> 00:32:18,867
拜托啊  就...
Please, just...

689
00:32:18,867 --> 00:32:20,067
试着当成是一次机会而不是...
Try to see this as an opportunity and not--

690
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:21,433
折磨?
Not torture?

691
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:30,168
对不起  我...
Look, I'm sorry, I just...

692
00:32:31,168 --> 00:32:32,367
我以为我慢慢好转了
I thought I was going to be okay,

693
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,567
可是你们却说...
And then now you tell me...

694
00:32:38,268 --> 00:32:40,001
那有没有计划点什么乐子
Did you have some kind of itinerary planned?

695
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,634
事实上
Well, actually,

696
00:32:41,634 --> 00:32:43,367
我们先去饱餐一顿
We're going to have a big feast first.

697
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:44,667
最后的晚餐?
Last supper, huh?

698
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:48,134
当然  配合你的弥赛亚情结
Well, suits your messiah complex.

699
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:50,734
那倒是
True.

700
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:55,101
别生我的气啊
Please don't be mad at me.

701
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:57,067
如果非得要我选
I guess if I had to choose

702
00:32:57,067 --> 00:32:59,268
我的最后一天跟谁过的话...
The people I would spend my last day with, then...

703
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:05,767
怎么了
What is it?

704
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:10,333
老实说  我真没期望能有效果
Honestly, I didn't expect it to work.

705
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:13,400
我希望什么事都不会发生  也确实没发生
I expected nothing would happen, and that would be that.

706
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,534
所以  我们为什么要这么做
So why did it?

707
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:18,934
跟我一样
You don't believe in magic shrines

708
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:21,567
你也不相信这圣地有奇迹
Any more than I do.

709
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,600
给他看下读数
Show him the readings.

710
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:29,934
嗯...
Hmm.

711
00:33:29,934 --> 00:33:30,967
我就是这么说的
That's what I said.

712
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,367
你说"嗯"?
You said "hmm"?

713
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:35,433
我是说我也觉得很诡异
I just meant that I thought it was weird, too.

714
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:36,367
你怎么看  某种反物质?
So what do you think, antimatter?

715
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:37,767
或者是某种超重元素
Or a superheavy element

716
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:39,134
古人曾用来当作能量源的
The ancients used to use as an energy source.

717
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:40,734
我从来没见过这个
I've never seen it before--

718
00:33:40,734 --> 00:33:43,101
或者制造出来给这个地方供给能源的
Or created to power whatever this place used to be.

719
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:44,333
这谁知道呢  都几千年了吧
Who could tell what that is? must be thousands of years--

720
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,734
看这脉冲
whoa, see that spike?

721
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,101
快点来  这是给你办的派对
Come on, this is your party.

722
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:49,067
玩得开心点
Let's have some fun.

723
00:33:49,067 --> 00:33:50,300
对我来说  这个才是开心的
For me, this is fun.

724
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,168
给我留点火腿
Just... save me some ham.

725
00:33:52,168 --> 00:33:53,500
看  又一次
Whoa, there it goes again.

726
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,134
看起来就像间歇的伽马射线
It's like some kind of intermittent gamma that's--

727
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:56,134
跟我来
Come with me.

728
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,433
干吗  为什么
What? why?

729
00:33:57,433 --> 00:33:58,767
我得确认一些事情
Because I need to find out something.

730
00:33:58,767 --> 00:33:59,967
我们去哪
Where are we going?

731
00:33:59,967 --> 00:34:00,634
幸运的话就一直走回亚特兰蒂斯
Hopefully all the way back to atlantis.

732
00:34:08,268 --> 00:34:09,467
对不起
Sorry...

733
00:34:09,467 --> 00:34:11,333
你为什么要这么做
Why did you do that?

734
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:12,567
想看看那些寄生虫
To determine whether the parasite

735
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:14,901
当我们把他带离放射源的话
Would expand rapidly back into his brain

736
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:16,567
会不会又加速扩张到他的大脑里
When we took him from the radiation source,

737
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:17,867
而且我认为就是这样子
And I think it did.

738
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:19,767
他的症状之所以
The reason why his symptoms disappeared

739
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:21,767
一到这儿来就消失
When we came here

740
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:24,001
是因为它收缩了以便自我保护
Was because it contracted to protect itself.

741
00:34:24,001 --> 00:34:26,500
好吧  那这说明什么
All right, well, what does that mean for us?

742
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,134
离开这个地方会置他于死地
That leaving this chamber will probably kill him.

743
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:31,934
我们不能把他带回亚特兰蒂斯
We can't take him back to atlantis.

744
00:34:31,934 --> 00:34:33,834
所以...
So...

745
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:35,867
我们得想个法子
We're going to have to find a way

746
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,468
让我能在这里给他动手术
A way for me to operate on him right here.

747
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:54,668
我以为你已经试过反射疗法了
i thought you already tried radiation

748
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,668
我是试过了  可是我没碰到过这种类型的
i did,but we never came across this kind before

749
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:01,568
寄生虫对辐射有反应  所以这里才会起作用
the parasite is radio-sensetive to it that's why the shrine works

750
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:05,668
这里的辐射让它们感觉到不舒服
it feels fine for one day until radiation start to making it feel sick

751
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:09,668
-可是人一离开  -它们就又迅速进入大脑
-and then you leave -the parasite began to back in your brain

752
00:35:09,668 --> 00:35:11,468
今天又要开始忙活了  我晓得啦
the day is over i get it

753
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,701
那这地方够操作吗
so here is it small enough to operate?

754
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:16,267
我是这么设想的
Well, I'm guessing here,

755
00:35:16,267 --> 00:35:17,600
这是唯一一点我能想到的
But it's the only thing I can think of

756
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,334
能对他的好转做出解释
That would explain his sudden remission,

757
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:21,967
但是没有直接看到我也不能很确定
But I'm not going to know for certain until I get in there.

758
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:23,267
可是用战地装备能搞定这个么
How are you going to manage that with a field kit?

759
00:35:23,267 --> 00:35:24,700
不用这些
I don't.

760
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,101
我们得去亚特兰蒂斯搬器材过来
We would have to bring equipment back from atlantis.

761
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:27,334
这就是问题所在
Well, that's a problem.

762
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:30,000
要是我们呼叫亚特兰蒂斯
What if we radio atlantis,

763
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,834
让他们送个小飞船过来
Ask them to send a jumper through

764
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:31,434
带上我需要的东西呢?
With what I need?

765
00:35:31,434 --> 00:35:32,267
不  我们不能这么做
No, we can't.

766
00:35:32,267 --> 00:35:33,767
我需要那些设备  约翰
I need that equipment, john.

767
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:35,367
听着  幽灵人
Well, the wraith

768
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,367
不可能再上当一次的
Are never going to fall for the same trick twice.

769
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:39,000
就算如果他们没有截获我们的无线电信号
Even if somehow they don't pick up on our radio signal,

770
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,201
即使第2艘飞船成功地到达了这里
And even if the second jumper makes it through the gauntlet,

771
00:35:42,201 --> 00:35:43,401
他们就会知道我们在这里
They'll know we're here.

772
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:44,267
我们就在也回不去亚特兰蒂斯了
We'll never make it back to atlantis.

773
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,234
如果我们不试试  他就会死的
If we don't try, he's dead.

774
00:35:49,934 --> 00:35:51,134
你需要什么
What do you need?

775
00:35:51,134 --> 00:35:53,401
手术用?  我已经告诉过你了
To operate? I already told you.

776
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,034
不是  我指最简装备  得包括什么
No, bare minimum, what do you need?

777
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:59,067
反正不止我的医药箱里那些东西
more than i have in my medical kit.

778
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:00,800
得要一个扫描仪
I mean, I need a scanner

779
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,534
来确定寄生虫的位置
To find out the location of the parasite,

780
00:36:02,534 --> 00:36:04,000
还得有些适当的工具
I need the proper tools

781
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,767
把他的脑壳给割开
To cut his skull open--

782
00:36:05,767 --> 00:36:08,401
好吧
All right.

783
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:09,800
我有主意了
I've got an idea.

784
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,167
尽可能的让他远离这东西
Keep him as far away from this thing as he can stand.

785
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:13,434
我们20分钟之内就回来
We'll be back in 20 minutes.

786
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,767
你不会想让我用这些吧
You can't expect me to operate with those.

787
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:49,200
我见过手术钻的
Well, I've seen surgical drills.

788
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,300
没有什么不同
They're not that much different.

789
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,767
好吧  那就算我们动了刀子
F-fine, assuming we can open him up,

790
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:53,868
我们还是没有办法确认
I still have no way of knowing

791
00:36:53,868 --> 00:36:57,501
寄生虫是缩到哪个角落的
Where the parasite has contracted to.

792
00:37:01,868 --> 00:37:03,367
我们可以用这个
We can use this.

793
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:04,467
生命迹象探测器?
A lifesigns detector?

794
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:05,801
有何不可
Yeah. why not?

795
00:37:05,801 --> 00:37:07,267
它不是用来探测
Well, it's just not designed to do

796
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:08,267
我想要探测的东西
What I need it to do

797
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,567
不是同一个尺度
On the correct scale.

798
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:12,133
那我们可以让吉妮来调整
Oh, we'll have jeannie modify it.

799
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:13,868
你不了解的
No. you don't understand.

800
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:15,033
那个放射物
The radiation

801
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:17,234
就在我们说话的当下  正在损害他的免疫系统
Is compromising his immune system as we speak,

802
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:18,934
如果我们没害死他
Which means if I don't kill him,

803
00:37:18,934 --> 00:37:20,100
在潮湿的洞穴里动手术
The infection he's bound to get

804
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,667
有可能造成的感染
By being operated on in a damp cave

805
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:22,934
同样也会置他于死地
Almost certainly will!

806
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:25,801
可如果我们不采取点什么措施的话
Look, if we don't do something,

807
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:27,400
他必死无疑
He's dead.

808
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,868
你说过的
You said it.

809
00:37:28,868 --> 00:37:30,067
绝对不要
Absolutely not!

810
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:31,901
我们是想救你
We're talking about saving your life.

811
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:32,901
我的脑袋
Look, my brain

812
00:37:32,901 --> 00:37:33,968
可不是你家后院
Is not some new deck

813
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:35,601
的什么新墙壁
Off the back of your house.

814
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:37,000
又不是我来动手术的
I'm not the one doing the surgery.

815
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,701
就算给我的临终赠言
Yes, and as my parting advice,

816
00:37:38,701 --> 00:37:40,334
你就应该阻止他们
You need to stop letting these guys talk you

817
00:37:40,334 --> 00:37:41,801
让你做这么愚蠢的事情
Into doing stupid things.

818
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,300
我可以的
I can do it.

819
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,100
真的吗
Really?

820
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,334
我也确定我能调节这个探测器
And I'm fairly sure I can modify the lifesigns detector.

821
00:37:47,334 --> 00:37:48,567
是啊  在我的帮助下
Yeah, with my help...

822
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:49,801
那就帮忙吧
So help.

823
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,501
这不是什么脑颅手术
This isn't one of those pbs brain surgeries

824
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:52,834
要大开我的脑壳吧
Where my skull is wide open,

825
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:54,033
而且我们还在讨论...
And we're having a conversation...

826
00:37:54,033 --> 00:37:55,133
我有足够的麻醉药
I have enough anesthetic to put you out.

827
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:56,701
你不会有什么感觉的
You're not going to feel a thing.

828
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:59,067
这值得商榷
Yeah, it's probably a hammer.

829
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:00,767
时间就是生命  罗德尼
Time is of the essence, rodney.

830
00:38:00,767 --> 00:38:02,133
做个决定吧
You need to make a decision.

831
00:38:02,133 --> 00:38:03,167
来吧  米尔
Please, mere.

832
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:04,334
我们试一试吧
Let us try.

833
00:38:04,334 --> 00:38:06,467
看来就我是反对派
Look, obviously I'd get around to consenting.

834
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:08,534
一口气丢给我这么多可怕的事情
It's just-- you've thrown an awful lot at me all at once.

835
00:38:08,534 --> 00:38:09,968
这就是生活
That's life.

836
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:12,901
好吧  我要吃点火腿
All right, well, let me have a little ham.

837
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:16,033
术前禁食
No. no food before surgery.

838
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:21,334
拜拜  吉妮
Bye, jeannie.

839
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,801
我有时太刻薄了  抱歉
Sorry I'm mean sometimes.

840
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:29,767
拜拜  泰勒
Bye. bye, teyla.

841
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:33,501
拜拜  若楠·德克斯
Bye, ronon dex.

842
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:38,567
拜拜  约翰
Bye, john.

843
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:46,534
拜拜
Bye.

844
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:06,367
我准备在这儿
I'm going to have to cut here...

845
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:09,133
这儿
Here...

846
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:11,067
还有这
And here,

847
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:12,033
从这些点钻进去
And drill those points

848
00:39:12,033 --> 00:39:13,167
切除这一块
To resect the area.

849
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:15,167
好的
Okay.

850
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:16,400
我不准备穿透硬脑膜层
I don't want to penetrate the dura layers

851
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,534
除非必须
Until we get to that stage,

852
00:39:17,534 --> 00:39:21,734
所以你尽量稳住他吧
So hold him as still as you can.

853
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,868
开始吧
Go.

854
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:02,400
我花太多时间来设置探测器了
I took too long reconfiguring the lifesigns detector.

855
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,334
该死  我钻太深了
Dammit, I went too far.

856
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:12,267
稳住他
Hold him steady.

857
00:40:12,267 --> 00:40:13,634
我在努力了
I'm trying.

858
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:17,567
是寄生虫
It's the parasite...

859
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:18,834
在动了
It's moving.

860
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:21,601
也许它知道我们在找它
Well, maybe it knows we're going after it.

861
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:23,133
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

862
00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:24,934
它应该是本能地想要
I think it instinctually wants

863
00:40:24,934 --> 00:40:26,801
逃开放射源
To get away from the radiation source,

864
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:28,834
我们这样只是给它提供了出口
And we've just shown it the way out.

865
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:38,868
若楠  枪借我们10秒钟
Ronon, we're going to need that gun of yours in about 10 seconds.

866
00:41:01,434 --> 00:41:03,067
你用脚踩就好了嘛
You could have stepped on it.

867
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:05,467
她说用枪的
She told me to shoot it.

868
00:41:06,501 --> 00:41:09,200
干净了
It's clear.

869
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,968
干的不错
You did a good job.

870
00:41:13,067 --> 00:41:14,067
你也是
You too.

871
00:41:17,968 --> 00:41:20,667
我们带他回家吧
Let's get him home.

872
00:41:34,634 --> 00:41:35,634
你去睡会儿觉吧
Why don't you go get some sleep?

873
00:41:35,634 --> 00:41:37,167
我整晚都在这里
I'm going to be here all night.

874
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:38,501
没事
It's okay.

875
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:39,334
我想看着他醒来
I'd like to be here when he wakes up.

876
00:41:39,334 --> 00:41:42,334
那应该还要一段时间
Well, it could be a while.

877
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,133
我们的罗德尼是爱睡觉的呀
He does love to sleep, our rodney.

878
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:46,901
你真该看看他小时候
You should've seen him when he was a teenager.

879
00:41:46,901 --> 00:41:49,200
这么吵谁能睡得着啊
Who can sleep with all the talking?

880
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,601
嗨
Hi.

881
00:41:51,601 --> 00:41:52,601
嗨
Hi.

882
00:41:52,601 --> 00:41:55,601
你的...  记忆都还在吗
You still, uh, all there?

883
00:41:58,868 --> 00:42:00,567
还可以装下很多呢
Well, there was so much to spare.

884
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:07,067
谢谢你
Thank you.

885
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:09,601
不用客气
You're welcome.

886
00:42:09,601 --> 00:42:11,567
那真吓人
That was scary.

887
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:14,133
我也是
For me too.

888
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:18,701
饿吗
Are you hungry?

889
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:23,400
饿极了
Peckish.

890
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,167
我去帮你弄点吃的
I'll go order you something.

891
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:35,033
珍妮弗  有些事我想告诉你
Jennifer, there's something I wanted to...

892
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,901
趁着我还记得  趁着我还能说
While I remember, while I still can,

893
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:42,300
有些事我想告诉你
There's something I wanted to say before, uh...

894
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,868
说吧
Go ahead.

895
00:42:43,868 --> 00:42:47,067
我...
I, uh...

896
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:48,667
我爱你
I love you.

897
00:42:51,434 --> 00:42:53,634
有一段时间了
Loved you for some time now.

898
00:42:58,234 --> 00:43:00,534
好吧  我在哪...
Okay, where was i...
