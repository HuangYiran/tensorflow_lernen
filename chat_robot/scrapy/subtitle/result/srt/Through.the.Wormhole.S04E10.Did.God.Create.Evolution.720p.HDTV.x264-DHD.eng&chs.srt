00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:12,612
Freeman: 我们的存在是有意为之的吗？
Freeman: Were we put here on
purpose by someone or something?

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,570
还是一些随机事件创造了
Or did some random event create

3
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:19,540
我们今日看到的复杂生命？
all of the incredible complexity
we see today?

00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:25,645
[嘶嘶声]
[ Hisses ]

5
00:00:25,646 --> 00:00:27,747
Freeman: 科学家一直在努力理解
Freeman: Scientists
have been trying to understand

6
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:29,649
生命的起源...
how life was created...

7
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,651
[相机快门声]
[ Camera shutter clicks ]

8
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:34,487
但我们的理解仍有许多空白。
But there are still gaps
in our understanding.

9
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:39,492
我们是更高级力量的作品，
Could our existence
be the work of a higher power

10
00:00:39,493 --> 00:00:42,696
还是自然法则造就的？
or was it the laws of nature?

11
00:00:42,697 --> 00:00:44,797
[雷声轰鸣]
[ Thunder cracks ]

12
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:47,468
神创造了进化吗？
Did God create evolution?

13
00:00:55,909 --> 00:01:00,580
空间，时间，生命本身，
Space, time, life itself.

14
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:07,487
宇宙的奥秘尽在穿越虫洞。
The secrets of the cosmos
lie through the wormhole.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,367
科学家估计
Scientists estimate

18
00:01:19,368 --> 00:01:22,371
地球上大约生活过数十亿个物种，
that billions of species
have lived on earth

19
00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:27,642
从最小的微生物，到50吨重的恐龙。
from the tiniest microbes
to a 50-ton dinosaur.

20
00:01:27,643 --> 00:01:32,581
圣经说上帝在六天内做出了它们，
The Bible says God made them all
in six days.

21
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:34,716
但还有另一个理论...
But there's another theory...

22
00:01:34,717 --> 00:01:38,520
生命在大约四十亿年前自发产生，
life created itself
about four billion years ago,

23
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:41,590
而已知地球上繁多的物种
and the myriad species
earth has known

24
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:44,726
全部是由进化产生的。
have all been the product
of evolution.

25
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:47,228
神学和科学
Theology and the science

26
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,631
都希望能够找到它们的共同之处。
struggle to find a common ground.

27
00:01:49,632 --> 00:01:52,100
当查尔斯・达尔文提出进化论时
Did Charles Darwin get it right

28
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:56,071
算是正确解释了生命起源吗？
when he proposed that evolution
created all life?

29
00:01:56,072 --> 00:02:01,644
还是生命是由上帝赋予的？
Was it the guiding hand
of some supreme being?

30
00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:04,881
亦或二者都是可能的？
Or could it have been both?

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,901
我以前经常在家附近的
I used to find caterpillars

32
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:14,904
树丛中寻找毛虫...
in the bushes near my house
growing up...

33
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:19,241
又肥又粗短的虫子。
fat, stubby worms.

34
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:24,346
不久之后，它们就会把自己包在茧中。
Before long, each one hid away
inside a silky cocoon.

35
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:29,718
我对这小小的虫茧中正发生着的很好奇，
I wondered what was going on
inside that tiny shelter.

36
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:32,588
如此丑陋的毛虫是如何
How did something so ugly

37
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:36,960
变成美丽的蝴蝶的？
transform into a beautiful butterfly?

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,137
Michael Behe是宾夕法尼亚州理海大学的
Michael Behe is a biochemist
from lehigh university

39
00:02:45,138 --> 00:02:46,604
生物化学家。
in Pennsylvania.

40
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:51,842
他是“智慧设计论”的支持者...
He's an advocate for an idea
called intelligent design...

41
00:02:51,843 --> 00:02:54,346
这种理论是指有什么人或什么东西
that someone or something

42
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:56,581
在地球上埋下生命的种子，
planted the seeds of life
on earth

43
00:02:56,582 --> 00:02:59,918
然后指导其进化。
and has had a guiding hand
in its evolution ever since.

44
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,087
Behe: 智慧设计论表明随机进程
Behe: Intelligent design argues
that random processes

45
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:07,359
是不能产生今日所见到的生命的，
can't produce
what we see in life today,

46
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,029
但它并不与古代生命
but it has no quarrel
with the idea of descent

47
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,500
发展到现代生命的观点相矛盾。
from ancient organisms
to modern organisms.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,035
Freeman: Michael与达尔文进化论的矛盾在于
Freeman: Michael's problem
with Darwin's theory

49
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:22,940
达尔文坚持随机突变造就了进化。
is that Darwin insists evolution
stems from random mutations.

50
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:24,642
但当他观察大自然时，
When he looks around in nature,

51
00:03:24,643 --> 00:03:26,911
Michael发现很多东西看起来
he sees plenty of things
that look like

52
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:28,879
像是随机放在一起的，
they were
randomly thrown together,

53
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,516
像这些木头碎片。
like the debris in these woods.

54
00:03:31,517 --> 00:03:35,119
最近这里发生了一场风暴，
We had a storm
pass through here recently.

55
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,989
没人会认为这种场面
Nobody would think
that any of this

56
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,958
是有人故意摆放成这样的。
was particularly arranged
on purpose.

57
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,560
你也能看到这是一团乱麻。
You know, it's just a jumble.

58
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:43,728
这有根树枝，
Here's a stick here.

59
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:45,863
那里也有个树枝，还有块石头。
There's a stick there,
a stone there.

60
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:48,833
Freeman: 但Michael认为自然界中有些东西
Freeman: But Michael believes
other things in nature

61
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:51,969
是不可能随机出现的，
could not have arranged
themselves randomly.

62
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,939
它们像是经过刻意设计的。
They appear to be
the work of a designer.

63
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,176
就像这些树枝不可能随机排列成
Just as these sticks didn't
randomly arrange themselves

64
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:02,780
“Life(生命)”这个单词，Michael不认为
into the word "Life, "
Michael doesn't believe

65
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:04,718
生命也不会随机出现。
biological life
came together randomly, either.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,637
Behe: 我是一名生物化学家，所以我看到了自然界中
Behe: I'm a biochemist,
and so I see evidence in nature

67
00:04:09,638 --> 00:04:12,407
大多数人不会考虑的证据，
and places where most people
don't think about,

68
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:13,842
因为它就在细胞中。
but it's in the cell.

69
00:04:13,843 --> 00:04:19,180
细胞是一个奇妙的纳米尺度的工厂，
The cell is
a fantastic nano-scale factory

70
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:23,385
其中有机器...由分子组成的机器。
with machinery... literally
machines made out of molecules.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,537
Freeman: Michael研究了细菌的结构。
Freeman: Michael studies
the structure of bacteria.

72
00:04:28,538 --> 00:04:30,375
一些细菌具有叫做鞭毛的尾，
Some bacteria have tails
called flagella

73
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:32,511
这样它就可以游动。
that allow them to swim.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,835
Behe: 这非常类似于舷外发动机，
Behe: It is quite literally
an outboard motor

75
00:04:37,836 --> 00:04:39,704
细菌靠它就可以游动，
that bacteria use to swim,

76
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:43,508
就像我们每天看到的舷外发动机，
and just like an outboard motor
in our everyday life,

77
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:47,312
鞭毛具有夹子可以固定到细菌的细胞膜上，
it's got clamps to hold it
on to the bacterial membrane,

78
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:50,715
还有螺旋桨叶可以旋转。
it's got a propeller
that spins 'round and around.

79
00:04:50,716 --> 00:04:54,519
如果你把其中的一部分或几部分拿走，
Turns out if you remove
one of more of these pieces,

80
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,923
鞭毛就无法工作了。
the flagellum
doesn't work at all.

81
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,625
Freeman: 细菌尾巴的复杂结构
Freeman: The complicated
structure of bacterial tails

82
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:04,998
使Michael发展出了他称之为
“不可简约的复杂性”的理论。
led Michael to develop a theory
he calls irreducible complexity.

83
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:08,334
这个理论认为生命系统需要其所有的部分
It claims that living systems
need all of their parts

84
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:10,736
才能工作，
in order to work.

85
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:13,707
它们不可能某一部分单独进化。
They can't evolve
piece by piece.

86
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,776
而达尔文的进化论则要求这种部件的渐进进化，
So, Darwin's theory
requires this gradualism,

87
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:20,049
这种模式中生物的特征是随时间缓慢演化的。
wherein some feature of biology
is built up slowly over time.

88
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:23,119
但在不可简约的复杂性系统中...
But with
an irreducibly complex system...

89
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,890
一个系统拥有数个组成部件...
that means a system that has
a number of components...

90
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:30,927
你不能随时间逐渐构建出系统来让其工作。
you can't build it up gradually
over time and have it work.

91
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:35,598
Freeman: 如果细菌的鞭毛只丢失了一个组件，
Freeman: If the tail of the bacterium
was missing just one part,

92
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:38,835
那么整个鞭毛都无法工作。
the whole thing
wouldn't function.

93
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:40,270
Michael不认为
Michael doesn't think

94
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:43,573
有机体可以单纯的通过进化
organisms could have made
such leaps of complexity

95
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:45,175
来完成这种向复杂性的剧变。
through evolution alone.

96
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:50,347
他认为生命接受了造物主的帮助。
He thinks they must have had
help from a creator.

97
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:52,249
我是一名基督教徒，
I'm a Christian,

98
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,851
我当然认为神创造了宇宙，
and so I certainly think
God created the universe,

99
00:05:54,852 --> 00:05:58,087
但我认为智慧设计论
but the nice thing
about intelligent design

100
00:05:58,088 --> 00:06:01,525
可以让你意识到有些东西是被设计好的
is that you can realize
something was designed

101
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:05,261
而你不需要知道设计者是谁,
without knowing
who the designer was.

102
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:07,431
但你可以对他设计的东西充满信心。
But you can be confident
of the design.

103
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:10,834
Freeman: 细菌尾巴的复杂设计
Freeman: The complex design
of bacteria tails

104
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:14,070
还不是最神秘的生物学空白。
isn't the most mysterious leap
in biology.

105
00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:16,807
还有更为复杂的结构，
There are
even more complex structures

106
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:18,642
更难以解释，
that are harder to explain,

107
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:21,211
比如脊椎动物的椎骨棘突。
like the bony spines
of vertebrates.

108
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:24,148
脊椎动物最早的祖先
Our earliest
vertebrate ancestors

109
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:26,750
有着叫做“脊索”的原始脊柱....
had backbones call notochords...

110
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:30,120
但却不是骨头，而是由胶原构成的柔韧的棒状物。
boneless, flexible rods made of collagen.

111
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:35,458
脊索至今仍存在于一些大型的淡水鱼类中。
Some big, freshwater fish that
are alive today still have them.

112
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:40,631
像我们这样的物种，在背部进化出了骨骼...
Other species, like us, have
evolved bones in the back...

113
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:43,166
形成了脊柱。
vertebral columns.

114
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:48,371
但条状脊索是如何
But how did long strips
of collagen make the leap

115
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:50,874
成为脊柱的呢？
and become bony spines?

116
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,646
瓦萨学院的生物机器人学家John Long
Bioroboticist John long
at vassar college

117
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,002
正在寻找这些消失的联系。
is searching
for these missing links.

118
00:06:57,003 --> 00:06:59,038
我们感兴趣的问题之一
One of the great questions
we're interested in

119
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,840
就是我们所属的称为脊椎动物的群体
is how did this group of animals
that we belong to

120
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:03,775
是如何先进化的？
called vertebrates
first evolve?

121
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:06,011
这都是五亿年前的事情了，
Now, this happened
500 million years ago,

122
00:07:06,012 --> 00:07:09,381
我们没有时间机器来回到过去
so we don't have a time machine
we can jump in, unfortunately,

123
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:11,083
看都发生了什么。
and go back
and see what happened.

124
00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:15,120
Freeman: John认为第一个脊柱
Freeman: John suspects the first
versions of the vertebral column

125
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:17,889
是我们DNA中出现的小错误，
were small mistakes in our DNA

126
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,993
使得骨沉积在脊索上。
that created little
bony deposits on the notochord.

127
00:07:20,994 --> 00:07:23,462
这些错误保留了下来，
They stuck around
because they ended up

128
00:07:23,463 --> 00:07:28,667
因为它们使动物变得更快更强，寻找食物更容易。
making animals faster, stronger,
and better at finding food.

129
00:07:28,668 --> 00:07:30,469
但古代鱼类化石表明
But fossils of ancient fish

130
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,672
这种进化是一步就完成的，
don't tell this
evolutionary story step by step.

131
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:36,575
化石记录中存在许多巨大的历史缺口。
There are huge gaps
in the historical record.

132
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:40,946
John于是决定填补上这些缺口，
So John has decided
to try and fill in these gaps

133
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:44,716
通过将已灭绝的生物复活...
by bringing extinct creatures
back to life...

134
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:46,054
比如这些机器人。
As robots.

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,869
欢迎来到Abyss(深渊)。
Welcome to the abyss.

136
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,172
我们在这个水池中创造了一个人造世界，
We create an artificial world
here in this tank

137
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:56,043
我们可以通过游动的仿生机器人重塑
for our swimming biorobots
where we reanimate evolution

138
00:07:56,044 --> 00:07:58,745
五亿年前的进化过程。
that happened
500 million years ago.

139
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:03,217
Freeman: John称它们叫做Evolvobots(进化机器人)，
Freeman: John's robots
are called evolvobots.

140
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:07,387
它们正准备开始生命这场游戏。
They are about to play
the game of life.

141
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:09,789
Long: 这是一根仿生脊柱
Long: This is
a biomimetic vertebral column

142
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,126
由胶原制成，
that's specially designed
out of collagen,

143
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:14,628
我们可以改变脊椎的个数，
and we can vary
the number of vertebrae,

144
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:17,564
这也是我们能够使其进化的特征。
and this is the feature
that we're allowing to evolve.

145
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:20,167
Freeman: John赋予其的脊索，
Freeman: John has given them notochords

146
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:23,836
由不同数目的脊椎组成，
that can each be segmented with
different numbers of vertebrae,

147
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,474
从0到5，到10或是15。
from 0 to 5 to 10 to 15.

148
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:34,280
在他创造的世界中，光意味着生命和食物，
He has created a world in which
light means life or food.

149
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:38,486
进化机器人的任务就是找到它们的食物。
The evolvobots' task
is to find their next dinner.

150
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:46,126
Long: 我们从0开始，到5、10和15根脊椎，
Long: So, we go
from 0 to 5 to 10 to 15,

151
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:48,361
我们希望得到的结果是
and what we're expecting
to have happen, right,

152
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:52,465
拥有脊椎数最多的机器人
is that the robots
with the most vertebrae,

153
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:53,834
就像这个，
over here,

154
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:55,936
比脊椎最少的机器人可以获得更多的食物。
will out-compete the robots
with the fewest vertebrae.

155
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:58,004
那么结果应该是金牌获得者、
So, this should be
gold-medal winner,

156
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,239
银牌获得者、铜牌获得者
silver-medal winner,
bronze-medal winner,

157
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,076
以及感谢参与。
and thank you for trying.

158
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:11,018
现在落后的像是0个脊椎的机器人。
Now, dragging way behind now,
looks like zero vertebrae.

159
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:14,489
Freeman: 有着分段脊柱的进化机器人
Freeman: The evolvobots
with segmented backbones

160
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,659
比没有分段的表现更为出色。
are performing better
than the one without.

161
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,695
Long: 分10段的现在位于首位，
Long: Look at number 10...
way out in front now.

162
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:22,597
接着是分5段的，
And then we have number 5,

163
00:09:22,598 --> 00:09:26,867
分15段的在边上，不过慢一些。
and 15 over on the side there
is getting there, but slowly.

164
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:30,271
Freeman: 让John惊讶的是，
Freeman: To John's surprise,

165
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:35,277
有着10根脊椎骨的机器人打败了有着15根的。
the evolvobot with 10 bones won,
beating the one with 15.

166
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,447
Long: 那么我们能得到什么样的结论呢？
Long: So, what do we have emerging here?

167
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:42,617
似乎中等脊椎数量的
It looks like
intermediate number of vertebrae

168
00:09:42,618 --> 00:09:45,319
更擅长寻找食物。
is doing a better job
at getting food.

169
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,222
 所以脊椎数目并不是关键，
So it's not just having
a bunch of vertebrae,

170
00:09:48,223 --> 00:09:50,057
关键在于其数目是否合适。
it's having the right number.

171
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:52,193
Freeman: John认为这表明了
Freeman: John believes this shows

172
00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:55,129
进化并不是一个设计好的过程。
that evolution
is not a designed process.

173
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,500
大自然可以已经随机试过了不同种类的脊柱，
Nature may have randomly tried
different kinds of backbones,

174
00:09:58,501 --> 00:09:59,702
只是最合适的存活了下来。
and the best ones survived.

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,202
我们发现如果存在一种增强觅食及
We find that when there's
selection pressure

176
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:04,904
逃跑能力的选择压力，
for enhanced feeding
and fleeing,

177
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:09,075
就足够能驱动脊柱的进化。
this is sufficient to drive
the evolution of vertebrae.

178
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,911
Freeman: 通过他的研究，
Freeman: Using his research,

179
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:14,047
John可以追踪脊柱的发展进程，
John can trace
the path of backbone evolution

180
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:17,084
直到我们现在的脊柱。
all the way up to us.

181
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:20,187
Long: 作为人类，一直困扰我们的想法是
Long: So, as humans,
we get bothered by the idea

182
00:10:20,188 --> 00:10:21,955
我们进化出
that we could have evolved,

183
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:24,658
如此发达头脑的荣耀，
in all our wonderful,
brain-heavy glory,

184
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,426
只是一些随机过程，
by random processes,

185
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:27,461
而让我们苦苦思索的
but one of the hard things

186
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:29,129
成为人类的难事之一
to wrap your head around
as a human being

187
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,699
就是进化并不是经过设计的，
is that evolution works
not by design

188
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,104
而是无人控制的自发行为。
but by hands-off
emergent principles.

189
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:44,211
Freeman: John的进化机器人向我们展示了
Freeman: John's evolvobots
give us a window

190
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:47,014
原始生物是如何进化成为
into how primitive organisms
can evolve

191
00:10:47,015 --> 00:10:50,517
复杂的人类的。
into upright,
complex human beings.

192
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:54,154
但地球是否拥有足够的时间
But has there been enough time
in the history of earth

193
00:10:54,155 --> 00:10:58,391
来进行缓慢而又不稳定的进化呢？
for this slow and unsteady
process of evolution to happen?

194
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:04,265
一位麻省理工的复杂性理论学家
正在通过计算来找出答案。
An M.I.T. Complexity theorist
is doing the math to find out.

195
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,501
达尔文的进化论主要基于
Darwin's theory of evolution

196
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,138
物种通过遗传物质的错误及改变
hinges on the idea
that species gradually evolve

197
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,575
来实现逐渐的进化的。
through a process
of genetic trial and error.

198
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:20,378
在地球生命产生的40亿年中，
In the four-billion-year history
of life on earth,

199
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,980
进化学家认为
evolutionists argue,

200
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:29,621
我们都是从第一个单细胞生命进化来的。
the first single-celled
organisms evolved to become me.

201
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,524
相信智慧设计论的人认为
Those who believe
in intelligent design

202
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,426
遗传物质的错误及改变
argue that trial and error

203
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,329
在这四十亿年中无法创造出
could never create
something so complex

204
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,031
如此复杂的生命。
in that amount of time.

205
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:43,402
进化论也需要计算吗？
Does the theory of evolution
add up?

206
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:48,539
这是个只有数学家能回答的问题。
That's a question
only a mathematician can answer.

207
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,911
当麻省理工的Scott Aaronson教授长大的时候，
When M.I.T. Professor
Scott Aaronson was growing up,

208
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,480
他有一个很大的梦想。
he had big dreams.

209
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,048
我小时候
When I was a kid,

210
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,784
一生的梦想是创造自己的电子游戏。
my dream in life was to create
my own video games.

211
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,920
电子游戏让我感到惊讶，
You know,
video games just amazed me.

212
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,455
它就像是整个世界的微缩版，
They were like these entire
worlds in miniature,

213
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:06,925
然而又不同于真实世界，
and yet, you know,
unlike with the real world,

214
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,227
一定有谁很清楚这些
模拟的世界是如何运作的，对吧？
someone must understand
exactly how they work, right?

215
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,962
因为有人制作了它们。
Because someone made them.

216
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:15,767
Freeman: Scott经常想象游戏中的人物
Freeman: Scott used to imagine that
the characters in his video games

217
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:19,070
就像是机器一样在工厂中生产出来，
were built in a factory
like machines.

218
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,305
最后他发现
But he eventually figured out

219
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:22,675
它们实际上是通过数学建立的。
they were actually built
from math.

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,935
Aaronson: 你可以说“这是游戏，
Aaronson: You could say,
"Here is the game,

221
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:27,904
然后这是游戏的代码。”
and then here's the code
of the game."

222
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:29,071
而这些代码
and the code, you know,

223
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:31,174
并不是对游戏的某种描述，
is not just some description
of the game.

224
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:32,308
它的确<i>是</i> 游戏，对吧？
It<i> is</i> the game, right?

225
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:33,709
你改变代码，
You change the code,

226
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,046
你就可以看到游戏也发生了变化，
and then you can watch the game
do something different,

227
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,280
这就很像数学问题。
which is
really just a math problem.

228
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:41,317
这对于我就像是一种启示，
And, you know, for me,
I think that was a revelation

229
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:43,821
好像是刚得知婴儿从哪里来一样。
comparable to learning
where babies come from.

230
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,034
Freeman: 这种领悟激发了Scott
Freeman: This realization
inspired Scott

231
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:49,270
深入探究于数学理论
to look
for deep mathematical theories

232
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:52,239
来解决许多最大的科学谜团，
to solve the biggest mysteries
in science,

233
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,045
比如生物如何进化出现在的复杂性。
like how organisms evolved
into complex beings.

234
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:01,816
智慧设计论的信仰者认为
Believers in intelligent design
like to say

235
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:05,019
像自然选择这种随机进程
that for some random process
like natural selection

236
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:09,957
产生眼或鸟类的翅或人脑
to produce the eye or the wing
of a bird or the human brain

237
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,325
都是不可能的，
is about as improbable

238
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:13,761
就像是龙卷风扫过废物堆积场
as a toRNAdo passing
through a junkyard

239
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:16,597
是不可能自发组装成可使用的建筑的。
and somehow assembling
a usable building.

240
00:13:16,598 --> 00:13:18,066
这就是我工作的地方，
This is where I work.

241
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:20,601
这里是麻省理工的史塔特中心(Stata center)，
It's called
the M.I.T. Stata center,

242
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:22,536
它看起来确实像是
and it does kind of look like

243
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:25,005
龙卷风经过之后。
a toRNAdo passed
through the place.

244
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:27,274
无论这栋建筑看起来如何，
This building,
despite how it may look,

245
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:29,476
都不是被自然进程设计的，
was not designed
by natural processes.

246
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:32,313
而是由建筑师Frank Gehry设计的，
It was designed
by the architect Frank Gehry,

247
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:34,048
但在数学和计算机科学中，
but in math
and computer science,

248
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:36,951
我们知道产生有趣的结构
we know that producing
interesting structure

249
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:39,286
并不一定需要设计者。
doesn't always require
a designer.

250
00:13:39,287 --> 00:13:42,357
Freeman: 神创论者通常认为
Freeman: Creationists often argue

251
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:45,025
进化是随机的，穷尽于搜索
that evolution is a random,
exhaustive search

252
00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:47,829
所有可能的生物学组合。
through all possible
biological combinations.

253
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,065
[呼哧]
[ Wheezes ]

254
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:52,466
这是一项不可能的任务，
An impossible task

255
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:55,737
无法在仅仅的四十亿年中
that could never have gotten
as far as it has

256
00:13:55,738 --> 00:13:57,671
就达到像现在这样完美的地步。
in only four billion years.

257
00:13:57,672 --> 00:13:59,907
[呼噜声]
[ Oinks ]

258
00:13:59,908 --> 00:14:02,978
Scott认为像人脑这样的复杂组织
Scott believes complex traits
like the human brain

259
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:04,081
或细菌鞭毛
or a bacterium's tail

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,602
是能够在这个时间中进化出来的，
can evolve
in a reasonable amount of time

261
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:10,805
因为进化不是一个完全盲目的过程。
because evolution is not
a completely blind process.

262
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:16,478
实际上进化有一些巧妙的捷径。
In fact, evolution
has some clever shortcuts.

263
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:21,149
想象这块象棋棋盘是空白的，
Imagine this chessboard is blank

264
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,318
Scott的目标就是恰当为其上色
and Scott's goal
is to properly color it

265
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:27,087
使得相邻两块的
so that
no two neighboring squares

266
00:14:27,088 --> 00:14:28,756
颜色不同。
are colored the same.

267
00:14:28,757 --> 00:14:30,058
那么你会怎么做呢？
So, how could you do it?

268
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:32,393
我们可以想到
Well, there are
three different approaches

269
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:33,695
三种不同的方法。
that may spring to mind.

270
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:38,600
那就来让我的替身--超级Scott来试试吧。
Let's see my avatar,
super Scott, here, try to do it.

271
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:40,802
如果超级Scott拥有
If super Scott had
the magical powers

272
00:14:40,803 --> 00:14:44,605
智慧设计者的魔力，
of an intelligent designer,

273
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:46,540
我假设，他就能
he could, I suppose,

274
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,812
在脑海中想到所有上色的可能，
just see in his mind's eye
all of the possible colorings

275
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:51,649
然后直接应用能够成立的上色方式。
and just instantly pick out
the one that worked.

276
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,817
Freeman: 对于智慧设计者超级Scott来说，
Freeman: If it takes just one step

277
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:58,688
一步为一个方格上色，
for the intelligent designer
super Scott to fill each square,

278
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:02,191
只需要花去他64步。
it would only take him 64 steps.

279
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,994
你只需几分钟就能创造人类，
You could create humans
in a matter of minutes

280
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:07,665
如果你有这种神一样的能力。
if you had this kind
of God-like vision.

281
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,333
Aaronson: 我们还能怎么做呢？
Aaronson: What else could we do?

282
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:15,171
一种暴力的方式...只是尝试所有上色的可能，
A brute-force approach... just
trying every possible coloring,

283
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:17,606
把所有可能的上色安排
every possible assignment
of colors,

284
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:20,577
适用到64个方格中，
to all 64 of the squares.

285
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:23,446
就需要2的64次方步
Well, there are
2 to the 64th power

286
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:26,249
来为棋盘的所有格子上色。
ways of coloring all the squares
of a chessboard.

287
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,684
大约是1.8的19次方步。
That's about 18 quintillion.

288
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:31,287
很明显他需要在这里耽误好大一会儿。
He's obviously gonna be at this
for quite a while.

289
00:15:31,288 --> 00:15:34,524
Freeman: 在这种纯粹随机的任务中，
Freeman: On this purely random mission,

290
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:38,428
即使超级Scott只有一块不正确，
even if super Scott gets
all but one square correct,

291
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:41,030
他就需要全部重新开始。
he has to start over again.

292
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:43,966
如果生命照此进化，
Is organisms evolved like this,

293
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:46,402
从单细胞细菌进化到
it would take millions of times
longer

294
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,138
今日的智慧生命，
than the age of the universe

295
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:51,007
所花费的时间
for a single-celled bacterium
to evolve

296
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:53,844
是宇宙年龄的数百万倍。
into the intelligent life
we see today.

297
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:57,381
而进化是以不同的方式进行的。
But evolution works differently.

298
00:15:57,382 --> 00:15:59,250
它会进行随机猜测，
It makes random guesses,

299
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:01,953
无论是否错误
but doesn't go
back to square one

300
00:16:01,954 --> 00:16:04,456
都不会回到之前的方格中。
whenever it makes a mistake.

301
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:08,793
Aaronson: 超级Scott在完全随机的棋盘上开始上色，
Aaronson: Here, super Scott starts
out with a complete random coloring.

302
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:10,995
他会去寻找相同颜色的
He can just look
for any two squares

303
00:16:10,996 --> 00:16:14,132
两个方格，随机挑选一个，
that are colored the same,
pick two of those at random,

304
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:18,503
并随机改变其颜色。
and then randomly change
the color of one of them.

305
00:16:18,504 --> 00:16:20,939
Freeman: 在这种进化方式中，
Freeman: In this evolutionary approach,

306
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,708
超级Scott可以持续纠正棋盘颜色
super Scott can make corrections
along the way

307
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:27,411
而无需每次从头开始。
without having to start over
every time.

308
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:30,915
Aaronson: 你就会怀疑这样又会花多长时间呢？
Aaronson: But you might wonder
how long will this take?

309
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,518
结果当然是比
Well, it turns out
it will take longer

310
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,588
智慧设计者久，这是肯定的，
than the intelligent designer,
that's for sure.

311
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:38,222
另一方面，
On the other hand,

312
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:42,159
又远非暴力方式那么慢。
not nearly as long
as the brute-force approach.

313
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,962
为一个8乘8的棋盘上色，
With an eight by eight
chessboard,

314
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:48,066
随机突变的方式会花5000步。
this random-mutation approach
will take about 5,000 steps.

315
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:51,670
Freeman: 5000步多于64步，
Freeman: 5,000 steps is more than 64,

316
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:53,507
但比起1.8的19次方步少很多了。
but it's not anywhere near
18 quintillion.

317
00:16:56,108 --> 00:16:57,943
这些关于进化的数学计算表明
These emerging mathematics
of evolution

318
00:16:57,944 --> 00:17:00,515
复杂的结构可以惊人的速度产生。
show that complex patterns
can arise surprisingly quickly.

319
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,602
我们发现非刻意的进化过程
We've seen that
a mindless evolutionary process

320
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:06,805
的确能够解决进化问题，
really can solve the problem,

321
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:10,642
能够在有限的时间内进化出现有的复杂性。
and it can solve it without
an inordinate amount of time.

322
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:14,813
Freeman: Scott并未声称他证明了进化是如何进行的，
Freeman: Scott doesn't claim
he's proven evolution happened,

323
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:18,716
这只解决了地球时间表的问题。
only that it is possible
within earth's timeframe.

324
00:17:18,717 --> 00:17:20,285
Aaronson: 对于我来说，科学态度
Aaronson: For me, the scientific attitude

325
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:23,021
并不在于世界上没有谜题，
is not that there are
no mysteries in the world.

326
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:25,290
而在于你不会困在谜题之中。
It's that you don't wallow
in mystery.

327
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:29,327
只有你持续寻找对问题的解释，
It's that you constantly look
for explanations of things,

328
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:32,630
如果你发现了对谜题的较好解释，
and, you know, if you find a
good explanation for something,

329
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:34,065
你就继续下去，
you go with it, you know,

330
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:36,802
至少到更好的解释出现的时候。
at least until a better
explanation comes along.

331
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:42,073
Freeman: 但在生命的公式中还有一个
Freeman: But there is
still one unknown variable

332
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:44,075
未知的变量。
in the equation of life.

333
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:48,045
亚利桑那州的一位化学家正在回溯时间
One chemist in Arizona
is rolling back the clock

334
00:17:48,046 --> 00:17:53,318
寻找哪里产生了最原始的生命。
to figure out where the first
spark of life came from.

335
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,670
这颗星球上所有的生命都有一个共同点...
All living things on this planet
have one thing in common...

336
00:17:58,671 --> 00:18:02,373
无论是植物、细菌，还是人类，
from plants to bacteria
to people,

337
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:08,413
所有的生命形式都使用了同样的
由DNA构成的遗传物质，
every life form uses the same
genetic material built from DNA

338
00:18:08,414 --> 00:18:12,283
或与其相关的化学分子，RNA。
or its close chemical relative, RNA.

339
00:18:12,284 --> 00:18:15,519
这对于认为所有的生命都起源于
This makes perfect sense
to evolutionists

340
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,491
一个共同的祖先的进化学家非常有意义，
who believe all life evolved
from a common ancestor,

341
00:18:19,492 --> 00:18:25,797
但还有个意义更为深远的问题仍待解答，
but there is a more profound
question still to be answered.

342
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:36,798
如果DNA是生命的基础，那什么或谁造就了DNA？
If DNA is the spark of life,
what or who created DNA?

343
00:18:39,144 --> 00:18:42,747
John Chaput是亚利桑那州立大学的一名化学家，
John Chaput, a chemist
at Arizona state university,

344
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:47,052
研究DNA的根源...
它到底从何而来
studies the roots of DNA...
where it came from

345
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:49,454
又如何持续存在这么久
and how it has survived
long enough

346
00:18:49,455 --> 00:18:51,523
来产生复杂生命。
to produce complex life.

347
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:54,025
对于所有细胞，生存就需要DNA，
For all cells to survive,
they require DNA,

348
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:55,826
因为DNA含有遗传信息
which is the genetic information

349
00:18:55,827 --> 00:18:57,962
或者说是生命的蓝图。
or the blueprint
for that organism.

350
00:18:57,963 --> 00:19:01,132
细胞想要生存，就需要生长分裂，
And for cells to live,
they have to grow and divide,

351
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:02,633
在这个过程中，
and during that process,

352
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:05,002
DNA就需要经过复制
that DNA has to be copied
identically

353
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:07,572
确保遗传信息能够
so that you maintain
that genetic information

354
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:10,274
从一个细胞到下一个。
from one cell to the next.

355
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:15,613
Freeman: John正在扮演DNA聚合酶(复制DNA的酶)的角色。
Freeman: John is playing the role
of an enzyme called DNA polymerase.

356
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:21,285
他的工作就是将遗传编码
从一条DNA链上进行复制。
His job is to copy the code
of one DNA strand onto another.

357
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:25,023
Chaput: “A”与“T”互补，
Chaput: "A" Always
base pairs with "T, "

358
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:28,561
“C”与“G”互补。
and "C" Always base pairs
with "G."

359
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:35,433
Freeman: 但DNA无法自我复制，
Freeman: But DNA can't replicate
all by itself.

360
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:39,637
它需要“聚合酶”John来进行复制。
It require John, the polymerase,
to do the copying.

361
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:43,043
但在生命起初时是没有John的。
But at the first spark of life,
there was no John.

362
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:48,214
这对于进化论是个大问题。
It's a big problem
for the theory of evolution.

363
00:19:48,215 --> 00:19:49,849
DNA应该不是
DNA could not have been

364
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,751
所有生命的分子基础，
the first molecular basis
for all of life

365
00:19:52,752 --> 00:19:55,354
因为它不能自我复制。
because it can't copy itself.

366
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:57,291
如果不是DNA，那什么才是原始生命的基础呢？
If not DNA, what was
the first spark of life?

367
00:19:57,492 --> 00:20:00,961
DNA很有可能是进化的产物，
It's quite possible that DNA
may be the product of evolution

368
00:20:00,962 --> 00:20:03,631
生命历史中在DNA之前
and that other genetic materials
preceded it

369
00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:05,066
还有其他遗传物质。
in the history of life.

370
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:09,536
Freeman: DNA是双螺旋结构，就像这根绳子。
Freeman: DNA has a double-helix
structure, like this rope.

371
00:20:09,537 --> 00:20:12,807
在DNA之前的遗传物质
The genetic material
that came before it

372
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:16,777
应该能够结合到其复杂的结构上
would have to have been able
to bind with its complex shape

373
00:20:16,778 --> 00:20:20,514
才能传递遗传信息。
in order to pass on
genetic information.

374
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:22,517
RNA是一个候选人，
One candidate is RNA,

375
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:27,455
RNA是我们现代细胞中存在的简化版DNA。
a simpler form of DNA that
is found in our cells today.

376
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:32,660
但如果我们观察RNA，就发现RNA同样很复杂，
But yet, if we look at RNA,
RNA is still very complicated,

377
00:20:32,661 --> 00:20:34,195
在它之前可能还有
and it may have been preceded

378
00:20:34,196 --> 00:20:36,230
更为简单的遗传物质。
by an even simpler
genetic material.

379
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:40,968
Freeman: RNA作为起初的遗传物质还太复杂，
Freeman: RNA is too complicated to
be the very first genetic material,

380
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:45,239
因为它的组分之一是称作核糖的复杂糖类。
because it's made of
a complex sugar called ribose.

381
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,744
想象下你是35亿年前的科学家，
Imagine you were a scientist
3.5 billion years ago

382
00:20:49,745 --> 00:20:53,247
等着第一个生命的诞生。
waiting for the first spark of life.

383
00:20:53,248 --> 00:20:58,319
为了形成RNA，五碳糖(核糖)的五个部分
In order for RNA to form,
five specific sugar molecules

384
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,921
需要自发的形成，
would have to
spontaneously come together,

385
00:21:00,922 --> 00:21:04,859
一个接一个的以特定顺序形成。
one by one,
in a very particular order.

386
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,027
科学家认为在地球上的原始沼泽中
Scientist think
the odds of that happening

387
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:11,265
形成五碳糖是基本不可能的。
in earth's primordial swamp
were highly improbable.

388
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:15,738
你要等很久很久。
You would be waiting
for a very long time.

389
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,975
但是John认为应该会有
But John thought there may be

390
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:23,445
比核糖还简单的糖可以构成遗传物质，
a genetic material made
of a simpler sugar than ribose,

391
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:26,082
一些更有可能自发形成的。
something more likely to form
on its own.

392
00:21:27,683 --> 00:21:31,920
通过在试管中重建进化过程，
By recreating evolution
in a test tube,

393
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:34,522
他可能发现了最合适的糖...
he may have found
the perfect fit...

394
00:21:34,523 --> 00:21:37,093
形成TNA的糖。
a sugar that forms TNA.

395
00:21:37,094 --> 00:21:38,461
[吹口哨]
[ Wolf whistle ]

396
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:39,695
不，不是那样的。
No, not that.

397
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:41,697
[女人笑声]
[ Woman giggles ]

398
00:21:41,698 --> 00:21:46,869
<i>TNA</i> 即苏糖核酸。
<i>TNA</i> or Threose Nucleic Acid.

399
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,371
苏阿糖是很让人兴奋的，
Threose is very exciting,

400
00:21:48,372 --> 00:21:51,407
因为化学成分上它比核糖简单。
because it's, chemically,
much simpler than ribose.

401
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:54,410
Freeman: John认为TNA更像是
Freeman: John thinks
TNA is a likely candidate

402
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:56,712
构成原始生命的候选人，
for being
the first spark of life

403
00:21:56,713 --> 00:22:00,382
因为它是个四碳糖，
because it is made of
four identical sugar molecules

404
00:22:00,383 --> 00:22:04,053
很容易就可以形成。
that come together
in just one easy step.

405
00:22:04,054 --> 00:22:06,689
Chaput: 当你用苏糖核酸
Chaput: And when you make
a genetic polymer

406
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,056
构建成遗传分子，
out of threose nucleic acid,

407
00:22:08,057 --> 00:22:10,559
它能与RNA的碱基良好匹配，
it turns out that it base pairs
very well with RNA,

408
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,728
所以TNA
so it has the ability

409
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:14,330
不仅比RNA有着更简单的化学结构，
to not only be
chemically simpler than RNA,

410
00:22:14,331 --> 00:22:17,500
它还能够与RNA进行遗传信息交换。
but it can also exchange
genetic information with RNA.

411
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:21,504
Freeman: John可能发现了DNA的祖先，
Freeman: John may have found
an ancestor of DNA,

412
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:24,874
它是古老的生命蓝图，
an ancient genetic blueprint
that showed up

413
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,743
远早于我们现今的
long before
the complex machinery

414
00:22:26,744 --> 00:22:28,911
复杂细胞结构。
that is in our cells today.

415
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:34,050
他还尚未证明TNA能够自我复制，
He has not yet been able to show
that TNA can copy itself,

416
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:37,019
但他认为TNA是迄今为止
but he believes
it is the best candidate so far

417
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,422
复杂生命前体的最好候选人。
to be the precursor
to complex life.

418
00:22:40,423 --> 00:22:41,692
Chaput: 所以生命是如此复杂
Chaput: So, life in so complex

419
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,837
使得许多人认为肯定存在一个高层次力量，
that many people feel that
it must have had a higher power,

420
00:22:45,838 --> 00:22:50,074
用神力创造了现有的生命。
a God-like power that helped
to create life as we know it.

421
00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:52,377
但现实是，当你从比如化学的角度
But the reality is,
when you take a look at it

422
00:22:52,378 --> 00:22:54,412
来看生命的诞生，
from the perspective of,
say, chemistry,

423
00:22:54,413 --> 00:22:56,414
这的确是一个问题，
it's really a question
of what molecules

424
00:22:56,415 --> 00:22:57,882
都存在过哪些分子，
might have been present

425
00:22:57,883 --> 00:23:00,418
这些分子如何互相作用？
and how were these molecules
able to react with one another?

426
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:04,355
科学家瞄准了一种分子，
Scientists are zeroing in
on a molecule

427
00:23:04,356 --> 00:23:07,926
它可能是地球上第一种遗传物质。
that may have been the first
genetic material on earth.

428
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:11,528
这会是生命的起源吗？
Would this be the spark of life?

429
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:14,899
也许需要比化学更深刻的答案。
Perhaps the answer
is deeper than chemistry.

430
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,867
如果生命起源
What if the origin of life

431
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:20,037
需要追溯到一个简单的规律呢，
can be traced back
to one simple pattern,

432
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:21,739
一个统治
a pattern that governs

433
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,511
整个宇宙结构的规律？
the structure
of the entire universe?

434
00:23:27,715 --> 00:23:30,584
你看的每个地方
Imagine if everywhere you looked,

435
00:23:30,585 --> 00:23:32,752
都能发现同样的规律...
you saw the same pattern...

436
00:23:32,753 --> 00:23:38,925
天空中，地面上，
in the sky, on the ground,

437
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:41,129
你身体内。
in your body.

438
00:23:43,565 --> 00:23:47,668
你可能认为这是一个伟大工匠的杰作。
You might wonder if it was
a signature of a craftsman.

439
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:53,473
实际上，宇宙中处处存在着这样的规律。
In fact, our universe really is
filled with such a pattern.

440
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:58,713
这就意味着某个伟大的设计者创造了一切吗?
Does this mean it must be
the work of a grand designer?

441
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:04,317
在Adrian Bejan成为杜克大学的工程学教授前，
Before Adrian Bejan became
a Professor of engineering

442
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:08,655
他从事着完全不同的职业。
at Duke university,
he had a very different career.

443
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:14,495
Adrian是罗马尼亚的明星篮球运动员。
Adrian was a basketball star
in Romania.

444
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:17,097
我是共产主义体制下的运动员，
I was a player
under the communist system.

445
00:24:17,098 --> 00:24:21,001
但篮球运动不是共产主义。
Basketball is not communism.

446
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:26,239
尽管在共产主义制度下，
篮球运动也要正确的进行。
Even under communism,
basketball was played correctly.

447
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,977
在我篮球生涯中最重要的一课
The greatest single lesson
from growing up in basketball

448
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:33,981
就是篮球像水一样沿着渠道运动，
was the idea that the ball flows
through channels.

449
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:35,316
这些渠道并不是严格规定的，
The channels are not rigid.

450
00:24:35,317 --> 00:24:37,819
它们在持续变化。
They are constantly morphing.

451
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,822
Freeman: 就像运动员Adrian把篮球
Freeman: Just as Adrian
the athlete saw basketball

452
00:24:40,823 --> 00:24:44,226
看做是球场上的水流一样，
as the flow of a ball
across a court,

453
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:47,429
工程师Adrian现在研究着这样的流动。
Adrian the engineer
now studies that flow.

454
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,464
他认为这会是
He thinks it may be the key

455
00:24:49,465 --> 00:24:53,403
了解整个宇宙设计的关键。
to understanding
the design of the universe.

456
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:58,841
篮球是一个活动的流动系统，
Basketball is
a live flow system.

457
00:24:58,842 --> 00:25:04,280
它会从球场上任意一点流向球篮。
The ball flows from any point
of the area to the basket.

458
00:25:04,281 --> 00:25:09,218
进攻队员试图打开这些渠道
The players on offense are
trying to open up the channels

459
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:12,521
来促使这种流动。
to facilitate the flow.

460
00:25:12,522 --> 00:25:15,458
而同时防守队员
The players on defense,
at the same time,

461
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:18,262
试着关闭这些渠道。
are closing down the channels.

462
00:25:21,265 --> 00:25:25,434
Freeman: 结果是越好的运动员就越频繁的得到篮球，
Freeman: Over time, the better
players get the ball more often,

463
00:25:25,435 --> 00:25:28,337
使一些特定的渠道更宽阔繁忙，
making certain channels bigger
and busier

464
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:32,241
较不活跃的渠道保持其状态。
while the less active channels
stay smaller.

465
00:25:32,242 --> 00:25:34,610
最终，就产生了规律，
Eventually, a pattern emerges

466
00:25:34,611 --> 00:25:38,380
形成了分枝树结构。
that resembles the shape
of a branching tree.

467
00:25:38,381 --> 00:25:40,015
这种树形结构无处不在。
This tree shape is everywhere.

468
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:42,284
它们数十亿次的反复出现。
They occur
in the billions and billions.

469
00:25:42,285 --> 00:25:45,788
它们构成了自然界的一种现象。
They constitute
a phenomenon of all nature.

470
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:50,292
Freeman: Adrian看到了自然界中无处不在的规律，
Freeman: Adrian sees the same
pattern everywhere in nature,

471
00:25:50,293 --> 00:25:54,563
从一棵树，到闪电，及叶脉。
from a tree to a lightning bolt
to the veins of a leaf.

472
00:25:54,564 --> 00:25:59,401
他试着找出这种结构出自哪里。
He's trying to figure out
where this pattern comes from.

473
00:25:59,402 --> 00:26:01,870
他认为这与物质
He thinks it has to do

474
00:26:01,871 --> 00:26:03,942
从一点流向另一点的方式有关。
with the way things flow
from one point to another.

475
00:26:05,543 --> 00:26:07,810
什么以树形结构流动呢？
What flows through the tree?

476
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:12,448
水从地面“流”向干燥的风中。
Water is flowing from the ground
back into the dry wind.

477
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:15,519
其他以树形结构流动的是
The other thing that flows
through the tree structure

478
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,288
机械力或机械应力。
is the mechanical force
or mechanical stresses.

479
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:23,059
风的力量通过树木
The force of the wind
is transmitted to the ground

480
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,828
传向地面。
through the tree.

481
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:28,098
Freeman: Adrian认为这种结构
Freeman: Adrian believes this design

482
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:31,902
是普遍自然法则的一种表现。
is an expression
of a universal law of nature.

483
00:26:31,903 --> 00:26:36,239
他称之为结构法则。
He calls it the constructal law.

484
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,508
这表明通常情况下，
It states, most generally,

485
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:42,913
任何大小有限行为有限的东西，
that anything
that is finite size and moves,

486
00:26:42,914 --> 00:26:46,650
为了与时间协调同步，
这也意味着生存，
in order to persist in time,
which means to live,

487
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:52,155
就必须进化出更加容易的
it must evolve such that
it flows more and more easily

488
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:55,692
随时间发展的更宽广的“渠道”。
for greater and greater access
over time.

489
00:26:55,693 --> 00:26:58,828
Freeman: Adrian看到了我们身体内部
Freeman: Adrian sees evidence
of the constructal law

490
00:26:58,829 --> 00:27:00,830
存在的结构法则。
inside of all of us.

491
00:27:00,831 --> 00:27:06,002
氧气在肺中流动，血液在血管中流动，
Oxygen flows through our lungs,
blood flows through our veins,

492
00:27:06,003 --> 00:27:08,838
电流沿神经元流动，
electricity flows
through our neurons,

493
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,742
全部以树形结构进行。
all in the same
tree-like design.

494
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,004
宇宙似乎就是这样创造出了复杂性，
The universe seems to be
hardwired to create complexity,

495
00:27:16,005 --> 00:27:19,674
或者说宇宙是以这种方式被设计的。
almost as though
it was designed that way.

496
00:27:19,675 --> 00:27:22,010
对于神创论的信仰者来说，
To a believer in creationism,

497
00:27:22,011 --> 00:27:25,014
树形结构似乎是创造者的标志。
it would seem like
the mark of a creator.

498
00:27:25,215 --> 00:27:27,783
Adrian并不这么认为。
Adrian says no.

499
00:27:27,884 --> 00:27:32,154
Bejan: 这种设计就像地心引力现象一样，
Bejan: The design is a phenomenon
just like the gravitation fall.

500
00:27:32,155 --> 00:27:34,490
我们并不知道这些性质为什么存在，
We do not know
why these things happen.

501
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:37,960
我们能做的就是总结这些现象，
All we can do is
to summarize these phenomena,

502
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:39,730
得出规律法则。
and those are the laws.

503
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:45,034
Freeman: Adrian认为树形结构
Freeman: Adrian thinks
this tree-shaped pattern

504
00:27:45,035 --> 00:27:48,004
自然而然的创造了更强
更具适应性的生物体，
naturally creates stronger,
fitter organisms

505
00:27:48,005 --> 00:27:51,006
因为它帮助了"流动"，
because it helps improve flow,

506
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:54,477
无论是水在树干中流动
whether it be water flowing
through the trunk of a tree

507
00:27:54,478 --> 00:27:58,815
还是篮球在球场上向篮筐流动。
or the ball flowing
through the court to the hoop.

508
00:27:58,816 --> 00:28:01,150
Bejan: 篮球实际上是一种
Bejan: Basketball
is actually a metaphor

509
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:04,387
社会中个体运动的比喻。
for the movement
of the individual in society.

510
00:28:04,388 --> 00:28:07,723
这就像是个人顺着“渠道”流动，
It is the same kind of movement
through channels

511
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:10,493
并努力保持“渠道”的打开，
that the individual strives
to open up

512
00:28:10,494 --> 00:28:13,896
同样的，其他人会在不经意间
and, at the same,
channels that others are,

513
00:28:13,897 --> 00:28:17,333
关闭这些“渠道”。
in fact, unwittingly,
trying to close down.

514
00:28:17,334 --> 00:28:21,170
Freeman: 也许宇宙的设计
Freeman: Perhaps
the design of the universe

515
00:28:21,171 --> 00:28:24,474
像是一棵巨大的树...
is like a giant tree...

516
00:28:24,475 --> 00:28:28,713
不断的通过增加流动生长、进化。
constantly growing and evolving

upside down.

那些巨大而又复杂的东西是如何出现的呢？

这些年青人可以这么歌唱
That these youth
can sing this way

548
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,916
是由于他们的神经细胞传递电子，

and so, it's physics
at the bottom, all the way,

wanted to happen.

在几何学中有证据
there is evidence
that this is true

证明这是真的。
in the form of geometry.

If you take that length,
square it,

再加上另一直角边的平方，
add it to that one squared,

586

就能得到直角三角形斜边的平方。

that governs what is possible
in the physical world.

He thinks geometric laws existed
before our universe existed.

592
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,526
人类只是发现了这些法则而已。

647
00:35:34,447 --> 00:35:36,281
是促进生产和乳汁分泌。
to facilitate birth
and breast feeding.

648
00:35:36,282 --> 00:35:38,150
当我开始着手这项工作时，
So, when I first started doing
this work,

649
00:35:38,151 --> 00:35:39,418
我的一个同事说，
one of my colleagues said,

650
00:35:39,419 --> 00:35:42,020
“如果只有女性可以分泌这种激素，
那么它就不会很重要。”
"it can't be that important
if it's only for women, "

651
00:35:42,021 --> 00:35:44,089
不过事实上男性也会分泌。
but, in fact,
men's brains make it, too.

652
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,891
问题就是为什么。
催产素到底发挥了什么功能呢？
The question was why.
Is it actually doing something?

653
00:35:46,892 --> 00:35:50,830
Freeman: Paul认为如果催产素的功能
Freeman: Paul wondered
if oxytocin had a larger role

654
00:35:50,831 --> 00:35:52,965
不仅仅是帮助生产，
than aiding in reproduction,

655
00:35:52,966 --> 00:35:55,567
那么它就可能让人们感到
that perhaps it helps
all humanity

656
00:35:55,568 --> 00:35:59,038
同情、爱与信任。
feel compassion, love,
and trust.

657
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,808
为了找出答案，他进行了一项长期试验，
In order to find out,
he began a long-term study

658
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:05,844
检测当一个人被迫去相信陌生人时
of how this brain chemical
fluctuates

659
00:36:05,845 --> 00:36:07,581
这种脑化学成分是如何波动的。
when a person is forced to trust
a stranger.

660
00:36:07,982 --> 00:36:12,152
今天，他的实验对象就是自己。
Today, his test subject is himself.

661
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:14,253
我们今天打算去跳伞，
We're gonna go skydiving today
to find out

662
00:36:14,254 --> 00:36:17,123
来看当人们面对其他人时的
what happens to the human brain
when you're under high stress

663
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:18,658
高度紧张环境中的脑部反应。
in the presence
of another person.

664
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:20,426
我们已经在实验室中证明了
So, we've shown in a laboratory

665
00:36:20,427 --> 00:36:23,095
催产素可以促使对陌生人的信任，
that oxytocin facilitates trust
in strangers,

666
00:36:23,096 --> 00:36:25,531
那么把你的生命托付于陌生人又会如何呢？
so how about trusting your life
to a stranger?

667
00:36:25,532 --> 00:36:26,833
这就是我们今天想要测试的。
That's what we want to test today.

668
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:29,602
Freeman: Paul首先在地面上
Freeman: Paul first takes a sample

669
00:36:29,603 --> 00:36:31,371
采集了自己的血液样本。
of his own blood on the ground.

670
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:35,608
这个样本会作为催产素的基本水平，
This will be used as
the baseline level of oxytocin

671
00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:40,013
这样就能在他着陆返回后进行对比。
so he can compare it to
his blood levels when he lands.

672
00:36:40,014 --> 00:36:44,050
串联跳伞是信任的终极测试。
Tandem skydiving is
the ultimate test of trust.

673
00:36:44,051 --> 00:36:47,053
两个人，一个降落伞。
Two people, one parachute.

674
00:36:47,054 --> 00:36:52,291
Paul的生命就在他的指导员Andy的手中。
Paul's life is in the hands
of his instructor, Andy.

675
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:54,728
这位就是Andy，这也是我第一次见他，
So, this is Andy. So, I've just
met him for the first time,

676
00:36:54,729 --> 00:36:56,129
我会把自己和他绑在一起，
and I'm gonna strap myself
to him

677
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,898
在12,500英尺的高空中跳出飞机，
and jump out of an airplane
at 12,500 feet,

678
00:36:57,899 --> 00:36:59,365
我不知道你是如何训练的，
so I don't know
how you're trained.

679
00:36:59,366 --> 00:37:01,567
我不认识飞行员，我不知道谁包装的你的降落伞。
I don't know the pilot. I don't
know who packed your chute.

680
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,502
这个我也不知道。
I don't even know that, either.

681
00:37:02,503 --> 00:37:03,703
[笑]是的，好的，那么...
[ Chuckling ] Yeah, okay, so...

682
00:37:03,704 --> 00:37:07,240
经过在地面的简单辅导，
After a brief coaching session
on the ground,

683
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:10,578
他们就要飞上天了。
there's nowhere left to go
but up.

684
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:18,018
大多数跳伞事故都是人为错误...
Most skydive accidents
happen from human error...

685
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:20,586
比如降落伞的包装不妥，
improper packing
of the parachute,

686
00:37:20,587 --> 00:37:24,924
检查不足，缺乏跳伞技巧等。
inadequate inspection,
poor jumping technique.

687
00:37:24,925 --> 00:37:29,330
Paul将他的信任交给一组陌生人。
Paul is putting his trust
into a crew of strangers.

688
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:34,500
我不认为我还有别的选择。
I don't think I have a choice.

689
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:35,769
现在我必须相信Andy，
I really got to trust Andy now,

690
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,370
我只是希望一切都能顺利。
so I'm just hoping
it all works out.

691
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:38,272
准备好了吗？
Ready to do this?

692
00:37:38,273 --> 00:37:39,171
开始吧！
Let's go!

693
00:37:39,172 --> 00:37:40,107
好的！
All right!

694
00:37:40,108 --> 00:37:41,040
让我们开始吧。
Let's do it, baby.

695
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,509
哦，看这场面。
Oh, look at that view.

696
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,844
已经准备好了。
Hands on the harness.

697
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:45,863
做个深呼吸。
Take a nice, deep breath.

698
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:46,879
好的。
Yeah.

699
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,965
现在我们找些乐子吧。
Now for some fun.

700
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,050
好的，哥们儿。
All right, man.

701
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,953
头往右。
Head to the right.

702
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:55,890
[叫喊声]
[ Yells ]

703
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:00,895
哇！
Whoa!

704
00:38:36,097 --> 00:38:38,631
做得好，你可以解开了。
Well done. You're unhooked.

705
00:38:38,632 --> 00:38:39,832
好的。
All right.

706
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:42,902
欢迎继续你的余生。
Welcome
to the rest of your life.

707
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,737
谢谢。
Thank you. Okay.

708
00:38:44,738 --> 00:38:49,141
Freeman: 落地之后，Paul马上采集了血液样本。
Freeman: After the jump, Paul
immediately draws his blood again.

709
00:38:49,142 --> 00:38:52,511
Zak: 我和那个人绑在一起，在12,000尺的高度，
Zak: I was strapped to this guy,
12,000 feet.

710
00:38:52,512 --> 00:38:54,914
我们像石头一样离开了飞机...
You know, we dropped like a rock
out of this airplane...

711
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,616
很不寻常的感受，
very unusual kind of event

712
00:38:56,617 --> 00:38:59,819
眼看着飞机离我而去...
where I'm watching the plane
move away from me...

713
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,788
有些慌乱与恐惧。
kind of panic, kind of fear.

714
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:05,392
Freeman: Paul将自己的血液样本带回了实验室，
Freeman: Paul brings his
blood samples back to his lab

715
00:39:05,393 --> 00:39:08,394
来看紧张情感下的信任
to find out if
the intense feeling of trust

716
00:39:08,395 --> 00:39:11,931
能否在脑化学中体现出来。
was reflected
in the chemistry of his brain.

717
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:15,334
正如预料一样，跳出飞机后
As one might expect after
jumping out of an airplane,

718
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:20,606
Paul的肾上腺皮质醇(一种压力激素)增加了5倍，
Paul had almost a 500% increase
in cortisol, a stress hormone,

719
00:39:20,607 --> 00:39:24,277
睾丸酮增加了40%，
and a 40% increase
in testosterone,

720
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,781
这又与胆量与勇气相关。
which is associated
with the feeling of courage.

721
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:32,185
但跳伞是否引起了道德分子
But did the skydive
cause a moral molecule

722
00:39:32,186 --> 00:39:34,354
开始发挥作用呢？
to jump into action?

723
00:39:34,355 --> 00:39:37,490
Zak: 我的催产素增加了17%，
Zak: I had about a 17% increase
in oxytocin.

724
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:40,092
17%对于与陌生人的交流来说
17% is actually
a fairly large increase

725
00:39:40,093 --> 00:39:42,461
的确算是很明显的增加。
for an interaction
with a stranger.

726
00:39:42,462 --> 00:39:45,665
举个例子，我去过的一个新娘的结婚典礼上...
So, for example, at a bride
at her wedding that I went to...

727
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,100
我采集了之前和之后的血样...
I took blood before and after...

728
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:48,868
我发现她(因为爱)的催产素增加了28%。
I found that she had a 28% increase.

729
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:52,138
我与我的跳伞指导员的联系
So, I'm half as connected
to my skydive instructor

730
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,008
是新娘与婚礼上新郎联系的一半，
as the bride was to her groom
at her wedding,

731
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:56,242
结果还算不错。
so that ain't bad.

732
00:39:56,243 --> 00:39:58,577
Freeman: Paul的研究表明
Freeman: Paul's studies have shown

733
00:39:58,578 --> 00:40:01,248
催产素水平与其他社会行为人
that oxytocin levels
are strongly linked

734
00:40:01,249 --> 00:40:04,017
有着强烈的关联，不仅是信任，
to other social behaviors
besides trust,

735
00:40:04,018 --> 00:40:06,619
还有同理心(移情作用)和慷慨。
like empathy and generosity.

736
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:11,824
如果催产素是控制我们道德行为的分子，
If oxytocin is the molecule that
controls our moral behavior,

737
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:14,660
那么这种分子又从何而来？
where did this molecule
come from?

738
00:40:14,661 --> 00:40:20,767
它会是渴望道德社会的造物主设计的吗？
Was it designed by a creator
who yearned for a moral society?

739
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:22,502
Zak: 我想谦卑的说，“我并不知道
Zak: I want to be humble
and say, "Look, I don't know

740
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,136
“在进化之前都发生了什么，
"What happened before evolution
started happening,

741
00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:26,239
“如果真有上帝，这一切又会多么美妙。”
and if there's a God,
how wonderful is that?"

742
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,007
但作为科学家我无法评论
but it's not my place
as a scientist

743
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,643
神是否存在。
to say whether God exists
or not.

744
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:31,379
我认为这是信仰的问题。
I think that's a question of faith.

745
00:40:33,714 --> 00:40:36,849
Freeman: 我们脑中的道德分子
Freeman: Is a moral molecule
in our brains

746
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:40,119
是神创造了我们的标志吗？
the sign that we are designed
by a holy God?

747
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,891
还是我们的脑就这么进化...
Or did our brains evolve
that way...

748
00:40:45,392 --> 00:40:49,562
使得我们能够团结生存？
allowing us to survive
together as a species?

749
00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:55,735
如果是催产素让我们信任和容忍别人，
If it<i> is</i> oxytocin that makes us
trust and tolerate one another,

750
00:40:55,736 --> 00:40:59,138
也许这种分子就能够
maybe this single molecule
is the answer

751
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:03,909
将神创论者和进化论者整合在一起。
to bringing creationists
and evolutionists together.

752
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:09,082
神创论者认为只有神的指引
Creationists argue that
only the guiding hand of God

753
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:12,351
才能将宇宙中无尽的原子整理成
could arrange the countless
atoms of the cosmos

754
00:41:12,352 --> 00:41:15,721
今日我们看到的非凡景象，
into the remarkable pattern
that exists today,

755
00:41:15,722 --> 00:41:22,028
道德分子只可能在道德宇宙中形成。
that moral molecules would
only form in a moral universe.

756
00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:26,032
进化论则指出了一个简单的规则...
The theory of evolution argues
that one simple rule...

757
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:28,001
适者生存...
survival of the fittest...

758
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:31,037
这样就能解释现有的一切吗，
can explain everything
that lives today,

759
00:41:31,038 --> 00:41:33,673
从最贪婪的捕食者
from the most rapacious predators

760
00:41:33,674 --> 00:41:38,209
到我们这样由内心深处
何为正邪的感受
to beings like us
who are guided by a deep sense

761
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,879
所指引的人类。
of what is right
and what is wrong.

762
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,884
这场争论不会很快就结束，
The debate isn't likely
to end any time soon,

763
00:41:44,885 --> 00:41:48,120
但有一点是双方都赞同的...
but there is one thing
both sides do agree on...

764
00:41:48,121 --> 00:41:54,261
即生命存在的伟大奇迹，
无论它是如何出现的。
the sheer wonder of creation,
no matter how it got here.
