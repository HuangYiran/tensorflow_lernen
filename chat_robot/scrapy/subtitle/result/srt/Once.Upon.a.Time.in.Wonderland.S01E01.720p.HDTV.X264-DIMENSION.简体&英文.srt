1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,730
很久以前

2
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,590
终于回家了
Home.

3
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,720
父亲
Father!

4
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,720
父亲
Father!

5
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,980
父亲
Father!

6
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,480
父亲
Father!

7
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,520
父亲  父亲  是我
Father! Father, it's me!

8
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,760
快开门  父亲
Come on, father!

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,240
你绝对不会相信我去了哪里
You are never going to believe where I've been!

10
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:56,960
爱丽丝
Alice...

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,520
一切都始于一只白色的兔子
It all began with this white rabbit,

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,620
-他想拿走我的帽子  -爱丽丝
- and he wanted to take my hat and then... - Alice?

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,060
真的是你吗
Is that really you?

14
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,410
不然还会是谁
Who else would I be?

15
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,390
你消失了很长一段时间
You were gone a very long time.

16
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,680
我们还以为你...
We--we thought you were--

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,590
你们以为我怎么了
You thought I was what?

18
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,050
死了
Dead.

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,680
白兔子  抽烟的毛虫
White rabbits, smoking caterpillars?

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,340
-巨大的蘑菇  -她以为我是傻子吗
- Giant mushrooms? - Who does she think I am, a fool?

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,360
她为什么要撒谎
Why would she lie?

22
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,040
你女儿得了妄想症
Your child is delusional.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,430
她在胡思乱想  编造了这一切
She's delusional. She's making it up.

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,430
-但我能治好她  -这么说她是个骗子
- But I can cure her of this. - So she's a liar.

25
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,380
她就是个骗子
She a liar.

26
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,070
我不是骗子  这都是真的
I'm not a liar. It was real.

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,840
我会证明给他们看的
And I'm going to prove it.

28
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:42,660
境

29
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:42,660
仙

30
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:42,660
奇

31
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:42,660
缘

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,660
第一季  第一集

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,290
如今

34
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,340
你又把小酒店关了啊  勒罗伊
Looks like you closed down the joint again, Leroy.

35
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,250
你真是在抵制那位每周都得徽章的顾客啊
You're really gunning for that customer of the week plaque.

36
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,660
这是双赢  艾希莉
It's a win/win, Ashley.

37
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,900
你的墙上有我的照片
You get my mug on the wall,

38
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,810
我也有...
I finally get--whoa!

39
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,390
不好意思  哥们  我们打烊了
Sorry, brother. Closing time.

40
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,170
暴风雨好像就要来了
It looks like a storm's coming.

41
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,940
你最好找个地方躲着  免得被淋湿
You better find a place to keep dry.

42
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,230
我这就去
I'll get right on that.

52
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,360
该死
Bloody hell!

53
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,690
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

54
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,370
我路上再告诉你  我们迟到了
I'll tell you on the way. We're late.

55
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,360
不  我对你的重要约会不感兴趣  兔子
No, I'm not interested in your important dates, Rabbit,

56
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,280
对你不重要的约会也没兴趣
or your unimportant dates, for that matter.

57
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,540
不不不  我们不是没赶上什么事
No, no, no, no. We're not late for something.

58
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,830
而是没赶上一个人
We're late for someone.

59
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,180
谁
Who?

60
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,890
爱丽丝
Alice.

61
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,050
她需要帮助
She needs help.

62
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,060
你是红桃杰克
You're the Knave of Hearts.

63
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,640
她需要你
She needs you.

64
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,390
贝特莱姆精神病院
英国伦敦

65
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,980
请你回答问题
Answer the question, please.

66
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,990
爱丽丝
Alice?

67
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,500
爱丽丝
Alice?

68
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,650
我不记得了
I don't remember.

69
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,350
我认为你记得
Oh, I think you do.

70
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,420
已经过了一年了
It's been a year now,

71
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,450
你的陈述一直十分清晰
and you've been quite clear in your statements.

72
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,040
会隐形的猫  
An invisible cat,

73
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,640
会抽水烟的毛虫
a hookah-smoking caterpillar,

74
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,440
能改变你的外形的食物和饮料
food and drink capable of altering your physical form,

75
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,780
还有凶残的红心王后
a murderous Red Queen.

76
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,070
而你遭遇这些事
And you encountered all these things by

77
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,620
全是因为掉进了一个兔子洞
literally... falling down a rabbit hole.

78
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,560
听上去...
Hearing it out loud, it all sounds quite...

79
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,680
非常荒诞  同意吗  爱丽丝
preposterous. Wouldn't you agree, Alice?

80
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,270
同意
Yes.

81
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,200
很好
Good.

82
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,690
再问几个问题
Just a few more questions,

83
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,960
也许这次我们就能放你回家了
and maybe this time, we can send you home.

84
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,680
你父亲最终把你带来我们这儿时
When your father finally brought you to us,

85
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,600
他已经束手无策了
he was at his wit's end.

86
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,150
让他头疼的不止是你
It wasn't just your multiple disappearances

87
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,470
多次消失
that had taken a toll.

88
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,790
还有你荒唐的解释
It was your ludicrous explanation

89
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,940
说你一直在为那地方
that you'd been searching for proof

90
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,460
搜寻证据  那个...
of this place, this...

91
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,690
仙境  你在那经历了
wonderland where you had

92
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,770
神奇  古怪而又可怕的冒险
miraculous, strange, and terrifying adventures.

93
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,420
你依然相信那是真的吗
Do you still believe that to be true?

94
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,590
喂  那是我的
Hey, that's mine.

95
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,380
还给我
Give it back.

96
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,050
有人擅闯  立定
Trespassers! Halt!

97
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,640
她朝迷宫方向去了
She's headed into the maze!

98
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,030
奉皇后之命  快停下
By order of the queen, stop!

99
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,420
别让她跑了
Don't let her get away!

100
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,730
她朝皇后的花园去了
She's headed for the queen's garden!

101
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,680
抓住她
After her!

102
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,370
我觉得她向这边跑了
I thought she went this way!

103
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,810
别让她跑了
She mustn't get away!

104
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,370
那个女孩哪去了
Where's the girl?

105
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,610
有人看见她吗
Has anyone seen her?

106
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,720
我觉得她向这边跑了
I thought she went this way!

107
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,850
爱丽丝
Alice?

108
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,900
爱丽丝
Alice?

109
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,750
爱丽丝
Alice!

110
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,420
不
No.

111
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,000
那不是真的
It wasn't true.

112
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,690
我从没离开过英国
I never left England.

113
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,220
所以那都是你编出来的吗
So you just... made it all up?

114
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,370
为什么  为了引人注意吗
Why? For attention?

115
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,120
你确实如愿了  对吧
Well, you certainly got it, didn't you?

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,230
我们今天要搞清的问题是
The question we have to answer today is

117
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,490
什么才是真实情况
which is the real performance--

118
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,950
是那个讲着茶话会和残暴皇后传说的小姑娘
little girl with tales of tea parties and barbaric queens,

119
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,250
还是说这一切只是想象的小姐
or the young lady who says it was just her imagination?

120
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,100
那个小姑娘是个傻瓜
That little girl was a fool.

121
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,560
那承认谎言的小姐呢
And the lady?

122
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,720
她知道真实情况
She knows what really happened.

123
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,590
全面搜查
Search everywhere!

124
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,350
她肯定就在这里
She has to be here somewhere.

125
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,820
全搜过了
There's nowhere left!

126
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,940
别让她跑了
Don't let her get by.

127
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,000
她跑哪去了
Where did she go?

128
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,910
你在我的瓶子里干什么
What are you doing in my bottle?

129
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,020
告发我  我就变成巨人
Turn me in, and I get big.

130
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,930
此时此地  把你家夷为
Right here, right now, burst your house

131
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,340
喝我

132
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,030
千百万块闪亮的碎片
into a million shiny pieces.

133
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,180
咱们都不想如此  对吗
We wouldn't want that now, would we?

134
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,820
现在  很难再找到什么好瓶子了
Good bottles are so hard to find these days.

135
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,100
我叫塞勒斯
My name is Cyrus.

136
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,510
欢迎光临  请随意
My home is your home.

137
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,810
后来你重新露面时
When you finally resurfaced,

138
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,850
你声称去了这个仙境
you claimed to be in this... Wonderland.

139
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,040
能否告诉我们  你当时到底在哪里
Can you tell us where you really were?

140
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,110
和朋友在一起
With a friend.

141
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,710
在哪里
Where?

142
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,350
阿格拉巴听起来很美
Agrabah sounds beautiful.

143
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,000
我希望有朝一日得以再见
I hope one day to see it again.

144
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,700
你的家乡叫什么
What place do you call home?

145
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,990
英国
England.

146
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,510
但我最近觉得  那儿并不是我的家乡
Although it hasn't exactly felt like home lately.

147
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,410
看来  我们都是这片古怪土地上的异乡人
So we're both strangers in this most strange land.

148
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,940
"古怪"只是这里的特点之一
"Strange" is one word for it.

149
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,580
-也可以说奇妙  -还很危险
- Wondrous. - Dangerous.

150
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,940
我觉得你能照顾好自己
I sense that you can take care of yourself.

151
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,700
你很快就得回到家乡去吗
And you have to go back to your land soon?

152
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,790
我来到这里  确实有我的目的
Well, I do have what I came for.

153
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,080
什么目的
Which is what?

154
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,520
证明这一切都是真的
Prove that all this is real.

155
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,520
你想要证据  来啊  我给你证据
Oh! You want proof? Come here. I'll give you proof.

156
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,760
一只穿夹克和长裤还会说话的白兔
A talking white rabbit in jacket and trousers?

157
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,130
没人再会说这只是我的想象了
No one can say I imagined that.

158
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,620
是啊  毫无疑问
Yes. That much is certain.

159
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,290
告诉我  爱丽丝  你要证明给谁看
So tell me, Alice, who is this proof for?

160
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,990
你冒了这么大的风险回到这里
You've risked much to come back here.

161
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,780
是为了你丈夫吗
Is it... a husband?

162
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,350
不是  我没有丈夫
No. There's no one like that.

163
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,910
那就好
Good.

164
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,530
好什么
Good?

165
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,570
我的意思是  你没有和心爱的人分离
I mean, just that you're not separated from your love.

166
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,190
那样就太悲惨了
That'd be a terrible fate.

167
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,530
对  的确如此
Yes. That it would.

168
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,250
是为了证明给我父亲看
The proof is for my father.

169
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,290
他认为我疯了
He thinks I'm insane.

170
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,170
真的吗
Really?

171
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,510
你冒着生命危险
So you're risking your life for someone

172
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,990
就是为了一个不相信你的人
who doesn't believe in you?

173
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,790
真正爱上一个人时
You know... when you really love someone,

174
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,500
根本不需要什么证据
you don't need proof.

175
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,450
你能感受得到
You can feel it.

176
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,490
也许在你的家乡是这样
Maybe where you're from,

177
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,590
但在我的世界  我希望一切能
but in my land, I wish things would...

178
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,840
你希望一切能怎么样
You wish things would what?

179
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,800
爱丽丝  你找到我的瓶子了
You found my bottle, Alice.

180
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,660
一切皆有可能
Anything is possible.

181
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,570
我亲爱的小姐
Mistress mine,

182
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,240
你的愿望就是我的愿望
my will is thine.

183
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,370
说出三个愿望吧
Tell me your wishes three.

184
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,450
爱丽丝  如果你想要离开本院
Alice, if you wish to be released from this facility,

185
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,190
-你就得  -我不希望任何东西
- you need to-- - I don't wish for anything!

186
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,470
这和...
Would... this have

187
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,680
你口中遇到的那个精灵有关吧
something to do with the genie you believe you met?

188
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,710
你和你父亲说
You told your father that you--

189
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,850
你解救了他
You set him free,

190
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,760
你俩从一个世界到另一个世界
that the two of you traveled from world to world,

191
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,410
与海盗搏斗  和美人鱼共游
fighting pirates, swimming with Mermaids.

192
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,330
然后
And then...

193
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,440
男情女爱的天性使然  你们坠入了爱河
men and women being what they are, you fell in love.

194
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,030
你准备好承认这同样是个谎言了吗
Are you ready to admit that that was a lie as well?

195
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,050
越来越奇妙
Curiouser and curiouser.

196
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,210
我听说过沸腾之海
I've heard of the Boiling Sea,

197
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,380
但亲眼所见之后  觉得它比传说中更加神奇
but in person, it's even more amazing.

198
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,320
你也如此
As are you.

199
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,010
小心
Oh! Careful.

200
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,400
爱丽丝  我从未见过你这样的人类
I've never met a human quite like you, Alice.

201
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,670
我也从未见过你这样的精灵
I've never met a genie quite like you.

202
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,520
其实我从未见过精灵
Well, actually, I've never met a genie,

203
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,680
所以
So...

204
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,900
好了
Okay.

205
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,210
对不起  我还不习惯
Forgive me. I'm not used to--

206
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,050
我总是负责实现愿望  而不是许下愿望
I was always the one granting the wishes, not making them.

207
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,490
许下愿望  什么意思
Making them? What?

208
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,690
一百年来  我被束缚在一个瓶子里
For 100 years, I was tethered to a bottle,

209
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,620
被心怀鬼胎的人所奴役
a slave to the faulty dreams of man,

210
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,960
但自始至终  我只有一个愿望
and all that time, I only had one wish--

211
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,530
再也不要被囚禁
to never be a prisoner again.

212
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,820
而现在
And now...

213
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,830
我有了另一个愿望
I have another.

214
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,740
等等  我想
Wait. I-I think

215
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,560
你们人类会这时候会单膝下跪
the people in you world do this down on one--

216
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,390
我愿意
Yes.

217
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,160
什么
What?

218
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,940
是的  我愿意
Yes, yes, I will.

219
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,050
可我还有一大段话要说
No, but I had a whole speech.

220
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,310
又动听  又动人  而且...
It was charming and eloquent and had--

221
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,870
我们心心相印
Our hearts are entwined.

222
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,600
从现在起  只要你在附近  我就会知道
From now on, I'll know when you are near,

223
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,480
你也会知道
and you will know.

224
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,800
爱丽丝  快跑
Alice, run!

225
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,390
你父亲找到你的时候
When your father found you,

226
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,250
你已经伤心欲绝
you were inconsolable.

227
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,910
你说你此生的挚爱已去
You said the love of your life was gone,

228
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,240
被杀害了
murdered by some--

229
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,710
不  那
No, that's--

230
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,190
那不是我说的
that's not what I said.

231
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,020
爱丽丝  你是一个被忽略的小女孩
Alice, you were an ignored little girl

232
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,490
需要别人的关爱  所以你幻想出一个奇境
who wanted to be loved, so you created a fantasy land

233
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,030
里面全是能帮你
full of characters who'd help you become

234
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,030
梦想成真的人物
who you wanted to be--

235
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,000
高大  勇敢  迷人
tall, brave, beautiful.

236
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,080
你不是第一个这么做的孩子
You wouldn't be the first child to do this.

237
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,910
但你却是第一个长大之后
You're just the first to grow up

238
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,870
依然相信它是真实的姑娘
and still believe It was real.

239
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,980
不  我不再相信了
No. I don't believe it anymore.

240
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,650
我们知道你在说谎
We know you're lying.

241
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,120
你梦中还是会为他而哭
You still cry out for him in your sleep.

242
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,670
-什么  -在你梦中
- What? - In your sleep.

243
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,380
每晚如此
Every night, it's the same.

244
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,900
你为塞勒斯而哭
You cry out for Cyrus.

245
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,080
抱歉打扰二位了
Sorry to interrupt.

246
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,430
我能借他一用吗
Mind if I borrow him?

247
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,990
塞勒斯  不
Cyrus, no!

248
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,670
塞勒斯
Cyrus!

249
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,830
爱丽丝
Alice!

250
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,720
塞勒斯
Cyrus!

251
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,500
塞勒斯
Cyrus!

252
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,250
不
No!

253
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,180
塞勒斯
Cyrus.

254
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,390
爱丽丝
Alice?

255
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,980
我们有了新的疗程  可以消除你的伤痛
We have a new procedure that can take away your pain.

256
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,000
让你忘记
Make you forget

257
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,470
任何...
whatever...

258
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,890
你放不下的人和事
or whomever you're holding on to.

259
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,440
只需一次治疗
One treatment.

260
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,840
就都...没有了
It all just... slips away.

261
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,350
疼吗
Does it hurt?

262
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,810
有一点
A little.

263
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,170
但比你现在的痛苦小得多
But far less than the pain you're in right now.

264
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,410
在这儿签名就好
Just sign here.

265
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,790
好孩子
Good girl.

266
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,500
现在去睡会儿吧
Now go get some sleep.

267
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,290
明天你将展开崭新的人生
Tomorrow your life begins anew.

268
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,370
塞勒斯
Cyrus.

269
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,580
时候到了
It's time.

270
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,580
把那女孩带来
Fetch the girl.

271
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,570
至少给我点时间换衣服吧
Could you at least give me time to get dressed?

272
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:06,970
你
You.

273
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,300
"你"
"You"?

274
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,870
你就跟我说这个  "你"
That's what I get? "You"?

275
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,830
我也很高兴见到你  爱丽丝
Well, nice to see you, too, Alice.

276
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,780
你在这儿做什么
What are you doing here?

277
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,050
对了  快点  我们得走了
Right. Come now. We have to go.

278
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,420
走  不  你不是真的
Go? Oh, no. You're not real.

279
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,040
我无比真实
Oh, I'm very real,

280
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,960
而且我们现在必须走了
and we must leave now.

281
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,230
我已经搞定了一些警卫
I've cleared out some of the guards,

282
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,300
应该能出得去了  
so we should be able to get out--

283
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,720
不  我不能走  不能走
No, I can't. I can't.

284
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,070
爱丽丝  听我的话
Alice, you need to listen to me.

285
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,090
不  我哪儿也不去
No, I'm not going anywhere.

286
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,680
你为什么老是这么顽固
Why must you always be so bloody stubborn?

287
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,920
他在这儿
There he is.

288
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,050
-我什么都没做  -真的
- I didn't do anything. - It's true.

289
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,870
我的意思是  如果她肯稍稍帮点忙
I mean, if she was the least bit helpful,

290
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,700
我们现在早走了
we would have been long gone by now--ow!

291
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,990
把他弄出去
Get him out of here.

292
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,400
爱丽丝  不  你认识我的  
Alice, no! You know me!

293
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,040
你记得的
You remember.

294
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,630
我不想记得  我想要忘记
I don't want to remember. I want to forget.

295
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,860
爱丽丝  听我说
Alice, listen to me.

296
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,640
-不要  -他还活着
- No! - He's alive.

297
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,500
兔子看见他了
The Rabbit saw him.

298
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,920
塞勒斯  他还活着
Cyrus. He's alive.

299
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,220
这不可能
That's impossible.

300
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,800
你跟我都知道  爱丽丝
You know as well as I do, Alice.

301
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,020
在仙境里没有什么是不可能的
Nothing's impossible in Wonderland.

302
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,380
你就打算这么救我吗
Was that your idea of a rescue?

303
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,840
我本来就是想送个信
Well, it was supposed to be more of a message delivery type situation.

304
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,770
我没打算...
I wasn't planning to--

305
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,880
好吧  我们走吧
Right, let's go then.

306
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,110
你们迟到了
You're late.

307
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,380
真是惊喜啊
What a surprise.

308
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,760
对你来说  什么时候都算迟到
To you, everybody's late.

309
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,830
说得对  我的标准就是比较高
True. I do have high standards.

310
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,530
你来的这个世界不错
Nice world you got here. Oh.

311
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,660
这是什么玩意儿  爪子踩上去很硬
What the hell is this stuff? It's pretty hard on the paws.

312
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,320
爱丽丝  站住  别这么做
Alice! Stop. Don't do this.

313
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,310
我能帮治好你的病
I can help you get better.

314
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,650
我们真的要在这儿听这人废话吗
Are we really going to stand here and listen to this guy?

315
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,720
出现幻觉了吗  医生
Seeing things, doctor?

316
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,450
我听说有专门治疗幻觉的疗法呢
I hear there's a procedure for that.

317
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,240
我们现在怎么办
Well, what do we do now?

318
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,000
跑
We run.

319
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,290
小心
Look out!

320
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,810
闪开
Out of the way!

321
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,730
闪开
Out of my way!

322
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,120
不
Oh, no.

323
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,720
我们等着被抓吧
We'll be pinched for sure.

324
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,510
不  不会的
No, we won't.

325
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,760
-他们来了  -兔子
- They're coming. - Rabbit!

326
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,270
在这儿  我们就不能找个
Here? Couldn't we find somewhere

327
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,040
土地松软的地方  比如田野什么的
with softer ground, like a field--

328
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,180
快挖
Dig!

329
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,430
好吧
All right.

330
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,170
走吧
Here goes.

331
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,740
你在等什么
What are you waiting for?!

332
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,860
爱丽丝  我离开那地方的时候
Alice, I didn't exactly leave that place

333
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,820
闹得不是很愉快
on good terms.

334
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,770
我也是  但是如果赛勒斯还...
Neither did I, but if Cyrus is--

335
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,190
那该走的是你  不是我
Then you have to go, not me.

336
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,960
听着  杰克
Listen, Knave.

337
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,260
很久之前  我帮你找回了你的心
Once long ago, I got you back your heart.

338
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,240
现在  我要你帮我找回我的
Now... you need to help me get back mine.

339
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,220
那边
Down there!

340
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,840
不然你可以找那帮人试试
Or you can take your chances with them.

341
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,000
该死
Bloody hell.

342
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:37,630
好吧
All right, then.

343
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,350
下一站...仙境
Next stop... Wonderland!

344
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,190
人类啊
Humans.

345
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,380
我讨厌...
I hate...

346
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,440
这个该死的...
this bloody...

347
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,270
地方
place!

348
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,830
小心点  杰克
Careful, Knave.

349
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,680
我们在棉花糖沼里着陆了
We've landed in the mallow marsh.

350
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,780
当然
Of course we did,

351
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,760
因为一片甜点奶油形成的湖最正常不过了
because a pond made out of dessert topping makes perfect sense.

352
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,440
快点  动起来
Come on. Shake a leg.

353
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,430
两条腿都动起来
Shake two legs.

354
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,650
太混乱了
Ugh! What a mess.

355
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,880
好吧  兔子  塞勒斯在哪
Okay, Rabbit. Where's Cyrus?

356
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,100
告诉我们  你在哪看见他的
Tell us where you saw him.

357
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,860
我没亲眼见到他  你跟她说我看见他了
Well, I didn't exact see him. Did you tell her I saw him?

358
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,160
-你就是那么说的  -那只是比喻
- That is what you said. - It was a figure of speech.

359
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,750
不是  我确定不是
Nope. I'm pretty sure it wasn't.

360
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,750
我的意思是
Uh, what I meant was,

361
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,470
我在跟睡鼠喝茶
I was having tea with the Dormouse,

362
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,610
他说  他看见他了
and he said that he saw him.

363
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,690
我们千里迢迢跑过来
So we came all the way here

364
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,820
就因为一个总打瞌睡的老鼠所说的已经话吗
on the word of a narcoleptic rodent?

365
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,430
别理他  兔子  继续说
Ignore him, Rabbit. Go on.

366
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,240
他说塞勒斯在疯帽子的老屋子里
He said Cyrus was at the Mad Hatter's old place.

367
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,920
那屋子已经废弃了
It's abandoned.

368
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,520
疯帽子  不在仙境很久了
The Hatter--he hasn't been in Wonderland for quite some time.

369
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,130
他一直没回来
And he ain't never coming back.

370
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,570
他在我挖矿的那个世界
He's found himself a nice little life

371
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,440
生活得很不错呢
back in the place I was makin' mine--

372
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,030
要我说  那个地方...
A place, I might add...

373
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,820
蜻蜓就是蜻蜓
where the dragonflies aren't actually dragons.

374
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,810
兔子  你是长高了吗
Rabbit, are you getting taller?

375
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,070
很可能
Yeah, quite possibly.

376
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,450
这种事在这里常有得是
That kind of thing happens quite a lot around here.

377
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,300
我们在下沉
We're sinking.

378
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,530
我的脚动不了了
I can't move me feet.

379
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,690
兔子  那地方在哪  疯帽子的屋子在哪
Rabbit, where is it? Where's the Hatter's house?

380
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,070
还能在哪  拼图森林
Where else? The Tulgey Woods.

381
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,230
杰克  我们得出去
Knave, we need to get out of here.

382
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,300
-是吗  -一切都会好的
- Really? - Uh, everything's gonna be fine.

383
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,030
我去...我去找人帮忙
I'll just, uh... uh, uh, I'll go get help!

384
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,550
别担心  一切都会好起来的
Don't worry! Everything's going to work out just fine!

385
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,540
别动了  我们会沉得更快的
Stop moving. We'll just sink faster.

386
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,130
是啊  短痛不如长痛嘛
Oh, because a slow death is so much more pleasant.

387
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,840
太讽刺了
This is humiliating.

388
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,070
我就要死成一个焦糖饼干了
I'm gonna die like a bloody s'more.

389
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,010
什么
A what?

390
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,180
是一种巧克力小饼干
It's biscuits and chocolate,

391
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,350
再把烤过的棉花糖...
and you get toasted marsh--

392
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,240
别管了  重点是我们要死了
Never mind. The point is, we're gonna die.

393
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,210
杰克  太好了
Knave, that's brilliant.

394
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,820
你在做什么
What the bloody hell are you doing?

395
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,780
我在做糖饼干
I'm making a sore.

396
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,360
-是焦糖饼干  -管他什么呢
- S'mores! - Whatever.

397
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,520
我现在觉得把你关进精神病院是正确的
I'm starting to think you were in the nutter for a reason.

398
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,700
看见了吗
See?

399
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,620
来吧
Come on.

400
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,630
那只兔子呢
Where's that rabbit?

401
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,640
天色要晚了
It's getting late,

402
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,430
我今晚还想在自己的床上过夜呢
and I plan on sleepin' in me own bed tonight.

403
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,180
你不能走  我们还没找到塞...
You can't leave. We haven't found Cy--

404
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,430
塞勒斯  没错
Cyrus. Exactly.

405
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,500
你听见兔子说的了
You heard what the Rabbit said.

406
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,780
他都没看见他
He never even saw him.

407
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,780
如果我早知道
If I'd known that,

408
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,520
就不会做这些事了
I wouldn't have done any of this.

409
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,480
我们现在都不知道  他是不是还活着
I mean, for all we know, he isn't even alive.

410
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,830
如果他活着呢
What if he is?

411
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,180
爱丽丝...
Alice...

412
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,170
我离开仙境是因为我做了很多坏事
I left Wonderland because I did a lot of bad things here.

413
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,510
很多人想看我死
A lot of people wanna see me dead.

414
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,070
他们是有理由的  老实说
They have their reasons, and to be honest,

415
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,330
那些理由都很正当
they're good reasons.

416
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,340
我是为了活下去才离开这里的
I left this place for a future I'm quite keen to see,

417
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,650
难道你指望我  因为你的直觉就去冒险吗
and you want me to risk all that for a hunch?

418
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,360
我可以给你报酬
I can pay you.

419
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,810
什么报酬
How?

420
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,470
你没什么东西能给我  爱丽丝
You don't have anything to pay me, Alice.

421
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,280
并非如此
That's not entirely true.

422
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,420
我有比钱更好的东西
I have something better than money.

423
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,440
愿望宝石
Wishes.

424
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,440
我不明白
I don't get it.

425
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,580
为什么你不用它们把赛勒斯带回来
Why don't you just use 'em to bring Cyrus back?

426
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,200
愿望宝石的效果...难以预测
Wishes can be... unpredictable.

427
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,640
如果我用它带赛勒斯回来
If I used one to bring Cyrus back,

428
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,170
他回来的时候  可能会被吊在树上
he might arrive hanging from a tree

429
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,770
脖子上还绕着绳子
with a noose around his neck.

430
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,310
使用愿望宝石
See, with wishes,

431
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,020
往往会带有一些附带条件
sometimes there's literally a string attached.

432
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,600
那可得小心斟酌许什么愿了
Then one just has to be careful what they wish for.

433
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,480
确保它能够达到目的
Make it consequence-proof.

434
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,300
我能做到
Yeah, I can do that.

435
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,580
也就是说你会留下了来吗
So does that mean you'll stay?

436
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,780
我们一起找到赛勒斯  我可以许一个愿
We find Cyrus, I get a wish.

437
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,810
任何愿望
Anything I want.

438
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,580
那就带我去拼图森林
Just get me to Tulgey woods.

439
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:21,840
你真相信兔子说的话吗
So you really believe the Rabbit, then?

440
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,330
我知道你心存疑虑
I know you have your doubts,

441
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,040
但是  我相信兔子
but, yes, I believe the Rabbit.

442
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
不
Oh, no.

443
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,200
你在这儿  兔子
There you are, Rabbit.

444
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,970
我的耳朵
Oh! My ears!

445
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,770
介意放我下来吗
Oh! Uhh! Do you mind?

446
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,050
女王陛下  让我解释
Your majesty, I can explain.

447
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,270
你迟到了
You're late.

448
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,720
我知道  我知道  非常抱歉
I know. I know. I-I'm so sorry.

449
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,350
我已经尽可能快地赶过来了
I came as soon as I could.

450
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,830
你把你听到的话告诉爱丽丝了吗
So you told Alice what you heard?

451
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,190
是的  我告诉她赛勒斯还活着
Yes, that Cyrus was alive.

452
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,370
他还活着吗
Is he?

453
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,580
我才是问问题的人
I'll be the one asking questions.

454
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,060
是的  是的  那么我们扯平了吧
Right. Right. So this makes us all square then?

455
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,380
你说如果我带她回来  我可以...
You said if I got her here, I'd get--

456
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,510
我说的是游戏结束以后咱俩再算总账
I said we'd settle up when the game was complete.

457
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,700
现在一切都才刚刚开始
We are still setting up the board.

458
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,390
至于你的朋友爱丽丝
Now as for your friend Alice,

459
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,100
她的一举一动你都要向我报告
I need you to report everything she does,

460
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,240
她去了哪儿  和谁说过话
where she goes, who she talks to,

461
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,770
在想些什么
what she is thinking.

462
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,060
我不只需要眼线
I need more than my eyes.

463
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,630
还需要你的耳朵
I need your ears,

464
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,940
你要是不帮我  亲爱的
and you will either help me, darling...

465
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,280
就等着来装饰这间屋子吧
or decorate this room.

466
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,940
明白了吗
Understood?

467
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,740
明白了  女...女王陛下
Yes, y-your majesty.

468
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,720
退下吧
Now leave.

469
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,570
拼图森林
The Tulgey woods.

470
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,640
疯帽子的家就在森林尽头
The Hatter's place is on the other side.

471
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,000
拼图森林  道路和居民在红心王后的慷慨庇护之下

472
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,560
你难道不怕这一切都是个陷阱吗
Aren't you worried this is all a trap?

473
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,520
只要有一丝可能  赛勒斯还活着
If there's a chance that Cyrus is alive,

474
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,110
我们都得去试试
We have to take it.

475
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,890
好吧  我们走
Right. Let's go.

476
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,470
红心王后  你说过就是她
The Red Queen-- you said it was also her

477
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,440
把赛勒斯推进了沸腾之海
who threw Cyrus into the Boiling Sea.

478
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,260
-她为什么要这么做  -我不知道
- Why would she do that? - I don't know,

479
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,260
但我很想问问她
but I'd love to ask her

480
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,080
看看她脸上是什么表情  让她知道
and see the look on her face when she realizes

481
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,040
我一点儿都不宽宏大量
I'm not the forgiving sort,

482
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,810
尤其是当我用这根树枝狠抽她脸的时候
particularly when said face meets this branch, repeatedly.

483
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,470
这可不像你
Doesn't sound like you.

484
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,380
医生说我对人对己都很危险
The doctors said I'm a danger to myself and to others.

485
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,170
你已经不相信所见的任何事了
Yeah, you can't believe everything you read now.

486
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,100
是的
I don't.

487
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,170
事实上  当我以为赛勒斯死了之后
In fact... when I thought Cyrus was dead,

488
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,530
我很难再相信任何事了
I stopped believing in much of anything.

489
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:17,670
怎么样了
Well?

490
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,500
她回来了
She's back.

491
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,450
那女孩正在做什么呢
And what is the girl doing now?

492
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,150
当然是在找她的小精灵
Looking for her genie, of course.

493
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,130
这不正是我们所希望的吗  贾法尔
Isn't that what we wanted, Jafar?

494
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,620
只有找到精灵的瓶子
What we want can't be accomplished

495
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,430
让得让那个女孩许下三个愿
until we have the genie's bottle

496
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,010
我们的目的才能达成
and the girl's made all her wishes.

497
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,360
要我说
So I'd say

498
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,150
你还没资格这样自满
perhaps you shouldn't be so pleased with yourself.

499
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,140
别用高人一等的语气和我说话  贾法尔
Do not talk down to me, Jafar.

500
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,220
我可是王后
I'm the Queen.

501
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,630
都是权力在作祟
That's the thing about power.

502
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,730
可是权力  是那么转瞬即逝
Hmm. It can be so fleeting.

503
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,640
你这是在威胁我吗
Is that a threat?

504
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,520
不是
No.

505
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,620
威胁是给那些措手不及的人准备的
Threats are for people who aren't prepared to act.

506
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,740
等等
Wait.

507
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,350
你需要我
You need me.

508
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,400
已经不需要了
Not anymore.

509
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,970
我能做到你做不成的事
But I did what you could not. I--

510
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,750
我让爱丽丝重回仙境了
I brought Alice back to Wonderland.

511
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,320
你确实管用过
Which means your work

512
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,410
但现在你已经没有利用价值了
and your usefulness to me is done.

513
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,750
下面的事就交给我吧
I'll take it from here.

514
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,050
你知道...
Do you know...

515
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,210
她在哪儿吗
where she is?

516
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,670
你知道吗
Do you?

517
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,560
没错
That's right.

518
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,770
你不知道
You don't.

519
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:11,440
现在你可不是在阿格拉巴了  亲爱的
Now you're not in Agrabah anymore, darling.

520
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,510
这是我的王国
This is my world,

521
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,450
只有我才知道她在哪儿
which means only I know exactly where she is.

522
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,370
只有我才知道她要去哪儿
Only I know exactly where she's going.

523
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,660
如果你仍想让我帮你
So if you want my help,

524
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:32,640
那好  交易继续
yes... our deal remains.

525
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,300
我会帮你得到愿望宝石的
I will get you those wishes.

526
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,010
拿什么作交换呢
In return for what, exactly?

527
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,450
到时候再说
All in due time.

528
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,040
你怎么还不踏上你那破毯子
So why don't you get on that raggedy carpet of yours

529
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,350
滚蛋呢
and fly away?

530
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,540
我来管爱丽丝就行了
And let me take care of Alice.

531
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,580
如你所愿
For your sake...

532
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,070
祝你成功
I hope you do.

533
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,670
我们一直在走
We've been walking forever.

534
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,580
应该到疯帽子家了
We should be at the Hatter's house by now.

535
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,430
该死
Oh, bloody hell.

536
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,480
通缉  死活不限  
红心骑士

537
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,420
我走之后  你都干了什么
What exactly did you do after I left?

538
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,900
别问了
Don't ask.

539
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,460
该往哪儿走了
Now which way?

540
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,420
向上
Up.

541
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,270
我不想再四处乱逛了
I'm tired of wandering around.

542
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,890
我们得换个视角
We need a different point of view.

543
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,810
什么意思
What do you mean?

544
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:54,410
爬得够高  我就能看到疯帽子的家了
If I get high enough, I can see the Hatter's house.

545
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,700
我受够了
Enough of these.

546
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,030
我看到疯帽子的家了  离这儿很近了
I can see it! The Hatter's place--it's not that far!

547
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,120
杰克
Knave?

548
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,870
威尔
Will?

549
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,390
柴郡猫
Cheshire.

550
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,580
是你啊  你吓到我了
It's you. You gave me a fright.

551
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,150
小柴
Chesh?

552
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,970
你不记得我了吗
You remember me, right?

553
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,350
我是爱丽丝
It's Alice.

554
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,830
是啊  我记得你
Yes, I remember.

555
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:22,280
你看起来...变了好多
You look... different.

556
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,330
万物都在变化  不是吗
Everything does, doesn't it?

557
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,790
仙境到处是陌生人
Wonderland has grown stranger.

558
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,560
我是  你也是
I'm stranger. You're stranger.

559
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,940
我们都是陌生人
Together we are... strangers.

560
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,920
好吧  你还好吗
Well, then... how do you do?

561
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,060
既然我们又是朋友了
Now that we're friends again,

562
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,970
你不会想吃朋友的
you wouldn't want to eat a friend now...

563
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,930
是吧
Would you?

564
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:46,370
没加胡椒的话当然不吃
Mmm, certainly not without pepper.

565
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,990
这几天我食不果腹
The pickings are slimmer these days.

566
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,820
这片森林曾经物产丰饶
These woods used to be full of food,

567
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,220
如今  这儿唯一的食物...
but now the only thing it's full of...

568
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,730
就是你
is you.

569
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,170
红心王后向我保证
The red queen promised

570
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:48,030
你的味道绝对鲜美可口
you would be the sweetest meat I've ever tasted.

571
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,400
那就试试吧
Let's see, shall we?

572
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,240
现在
Now then...

573
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,420
去找跟你体型相当的猎物吧
Go pick on somebody your own size.

574
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,110
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

575
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,990
你  你竟...
You. You were--

576
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,070
如此英勇
Brave?

577
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,160
如此勇敢
Daring?

578
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,120
偷走我的愿望宝石
Stealing my wishes.

579
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,360
那个啊
Oh, that.

580
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,870
那只是个误会
I think maybe you misunderstand.

581
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,280
我是想保护它们啊
I was just protecting the wishes.

582
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,100
你觉得我会信吗
You expect me to believe that?

583
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,390
不会  不
Not really, no.

584
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,940
可问题是  我又回来
But can we focus on the part where I came back

585
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,300
救了你啊
and saved your life?

586
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,210
你知道愿望是没法被偷走的
You know you can't steal a wish.

587
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,790
它必须被赐予
It has to be granted.

588
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,270
我当然知道
Of course I did.

589
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,590
人尽皆知
Everybody knows that.

590
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,270
我们去找塞勒斯吧
Let's go get Cyrus.

591
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,020
杰克
Knave.

592
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,390
在那边  快
Over there! Hurry!

593
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,780
塞勒斯
Cyrus?!

594
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,480
疯帽子的房子
The Hatter's house.

595
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,310
塞勒斯
Cyrus.

596
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,970
塞勒斯
Cyrus!

597
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,890
塞勒斯
Cyrus!

598
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,770
塞勒斯
Cyrus.

599
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,240
我在这
I'm here.

600
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,150
爱丽丝
Alice.

601
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,050
他一定在这里  太黑了看不见
He must be here. It's too dark to tell,

602
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,530
也许他在睡觉
or maybe he's sleeping or something.

603
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,720
你们在这啊
Oh, here you are.

604
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,260
我一直在找你们
I've been looking all over.

605
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,840
我带了一整支队伍
I showed up with a whole troop

606
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,830
去把你们拖出沼泽
to pull you out of that marsh,

607
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,370
但是你们走了
but you were gone.

608
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,370
没关系  兔子  挖洞送我们回家吧
It's okay, Rabbit. Just dig us back home.

609
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,830
塞勒斯不在这里
Cyrus ain't here.

610
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,240
不  他一定在
No, he must be here.

611
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,760
爱丽丝
Alice...

612
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,100
爱丽丝
Alice.

613
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,050
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

614
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,730
但他不在这里
But he's not here.

615
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,390
据我所知  他从没来过
And as far as I can tell, he never was.

616
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,520
也许
Maybe...

617
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,780
也许睡鼠说错了房子  或者
maybe the Dormouse just named the wrong house, or--

618
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,300
兔子  够了
Rabbit, enough.

619
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,660
如果塞勒斯来了
If Cyrus were here,

620
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,430
那他早该出现了
wouldn't he have shown himself by now?

621
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,510
所以他真的走了
So he really is gone.

622
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:00,970
爱丽丝
Alice.

623
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,810
你又一次让她痛失所爱
You made her lose Cyrus twice.

624
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,420
为什么要这样做
Why would you do that?

625
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,540
威尔  兔子  快过来
Will, Rabbit, come quickly!

626
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,010
我找到了这个  这是塞勒斯的
I found this. It was Cyrus's.

627
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,200
你从哪找到的
Where did you get that?

628
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,920
就在草地里
It was just here in the grass.

629
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,080
他还活着
He's alive.

630
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,730
任何东西都无法在沸腾之海中存活
Nothing could survive the Boiling Sea.

631
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,140
如果它完好无损  那他也活着
If it survived, so did he.

632
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:07,510
爱丽丝  那条项链是带有魔法的
Alice, that necklace-- it's magic.

633
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:10,610
所以它才没被损坏  戴项链的人
That's why it survived. The guy wearing it--

634
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,160
他不过是血肉之躯
he was just flesh and blood.

635
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,810
他走了
He's gone.

636
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,350
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

637
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,590
现在我们走吧
Now let's get out of here.

638
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,960
兔子可以挖洞
The Rabbit can dig his hole.

639
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,260
你可以过上新的生活  拥有新的爱情
You can make a new life, meet somebody else.

640
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,050
-不  -不
- No. - No?

641
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,080
我不走
I'm not going.

642
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,780
爱丽丝  这不是固执的时候
Alice, this isn't the time to be stubborn.

643
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:28,670
我没有固执
I'm not being stubborn.

644
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,810
你就有
Yes, you are.

645
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:32,470
如果你想走  就走吧
If you want to leave, leave.

646
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,480
但我要留下来
But I'm staying.

647
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,780
就因为那条项链吗
Because of a necklace?

648
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,030
因为他在这里
Because he's here.

649
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,940
但你没有证据
But you have no proof.

650
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,960
真正爱上一个人时
When you really love someone,

651
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,670
根本不需要什么证据
you don't need proof.

652
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,920
你能感受得到
You can feel it.

653
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,540
他在这里
He's here.

654
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,650
我要找到他
I'm gonna find him.

655
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,720
唯一的问题是
Only question is...

656
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,860
你会和我一起吗
are you coming with me?

657
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,030
我就怕你会这么问我
I was afraid you were going to ask me that.

658
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,760
这是同意了吗
Is that a "yes"?

659
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,050
该死的
Bloody hell.

660
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,030
走吧
Come on then.

661
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,130
爱丽丝
Alice.

662
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,420
不
No!
