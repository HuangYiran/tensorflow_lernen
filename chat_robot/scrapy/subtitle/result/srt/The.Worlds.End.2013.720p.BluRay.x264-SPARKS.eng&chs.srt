Ever had one of those nights

Are you sitting comfortably? Then we'll begin.
大家坐好了吗? 我们要开始了

我们叫我老金 因为我的名字是加里・金

Ollie was funny, he fancied himself as a bit of a player, but really, he was all mouth.
奥利挺有意思 他自以为风流倜傥 但其实只会耍嘴皮子

8

We called him O-Man

And Andy. Andy was my wingman.

There was nothing we were gonna miss about school.

Maybe Mr. Shepherd.

He was definitely one of the good guys.

He used to ask me what I wanted to do with my life,

I told him I just wanted to have a good time.

Not that night.

The aim? To conquer The Golden Mile.

We took my car into town.

I called it The Beast because she was pretty hairy.

And so, our journey into manhood began.

We hit pub one and we hit it hard.

By pub five, we were feeling invincible

and decided to purchase some herbal refreshment

45
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,672
from a man we called The Reverend Green.
买点带劲的草本物质

46
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,916
Pint six put O-Man out of commission, so we carried on without him.
喝到第六杯 圈仔不省人事 于是我们扔下他继续走

山姆跟着我们了一会儿 但是我得甩掉她

Nine pints in and it was us against the world.

Things got mental in The Beehive,

so we repaired to the bowls club

or as we liked to call it, The Smokehouse, which is when it all went fuck up.
我们喜欢叫它烟屋 那里的一切都很疯狂

Everyone got para and Pete chucked a whitey, so we had to bench him.
每个人都迷迷糊糊 皮特吸得脸发白 所以我们让他留下休息

seeing the orange glow of a new dawn break
看着黎明的太阳冲破地平线

and knowing in my heart, life would never feel this good again.

Why should getting older affect something as important as friendship?

跟在加里・金屁股后面到处逛

258
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,148
Hello, Steven.
你好 史蒂文

259
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,349
You all right, mate?
你还好吧 哥们?

260
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,795
- Pete.  - Hi, mate.
- 皮特  - 嗨 哥们

261
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,254
Didn't we decide to stop calling him Fearless Leader somewhere around 1992?
我们不是从1992年开始就不叫他无敌领袖了吗?

262
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,522
Old habits die hard.
真是本性难移

263
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,090
They'll be putting that on Gary's tombstone.
他们会把这几个字刻在加里的墓碑上

264
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,825
No, they won't. You know he'll outlive us all.
不会的 他肯定活的比我们长

265
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,560
That'll be funny if it wasn't true.
要是那样就有意思了

266
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,529
- Hang on a sec.  - What?
- 等一下  - 怎么了?

267
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,732
I'm just trying to decide which of us is the biggest idiot for coming.
我想知道我们究竟谁是最傻的那一个

268
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,442
Maybe he had an accident. Oh, sorry, Andy.
也许他出车祸了 不好意思 安迪

269
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,844
- Sorry.  - No, no, no. It's fine.
- 抱歉  - 没事 没事

270
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,112
I think Gary having an accident
我觉得加里要是真出了车祸

271
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,787
would actually be the best outcome for all of us, including Gary.
这对我们都好 对他自己也好

272
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,597
Unbelievable.
没搞错吧

273
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,495
Oh, yes.
来吧

274
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,594
Look at these cunts.

- You're late.  - No, I'm not.
- 你迟到了  - 没有

276
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,633
Yeah, you are. You said 3:00. It's almost 4:00.
你有 你说的是三点 现在都快四点了

277
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,200
Yeah, 3 for 4.
对 不三不四嘛

278
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,135
You know your problem, Gary? You're never wrong.
你知道吗 加里? 你从来不肯低头认错

279
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,236
How is that a problem?
这有什么不对吗?

280
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,171
I can't believe you bought another Granada Mark II.
真不敢相信 你又买了一辆格拉纳达二代

281
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,239
What do you mean?
什么意思?

282
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,875
This looks exactly like the car I sold you in 1989.
它和我89年卖给你的那辆一模一样

283
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,878
This is the car you sold me in 1989. Best 300 quid I ever spent.
这就是1989年你卖给我的那辆 300英镑真是物超所值

284
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,290
- This is The Beast?  - Yeah.
- 这是野兽?  - 嗯

285
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,849
Pretty much. I mean, she's had a bit of work done.
差不多吧 我把她修整了一下

286
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,052
I had to replace the brakes, suspension, exhaust, seats, wheels,
换了刹车 悬架 排气管 座椅 轮胎

287
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,455
paneling, carburetor, manifold, the whole engine, really, mirrors, headlamps.
嵌板 化油器 分电盘 全套发动机 后视镜 还有头灯

288
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,991
Other than that, she's the same old motor.
但除此之外 它还是原来那样车

289
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,335
You could almost say an antique.
它可以算是古董了

290
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:58,636
Well, then let's get this antique on the roadshow.
我们开着这个古董上路表演吧

291
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,217
Come on, you bellends. We're going to be late.
来吧 巡回演出 别晚了

292
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,619
And we're back. Just like the Five Musketeers.
我们回来了 就像五个火枪手

293
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,311
Three Musketeers, isn't it?
不是三个火枪手吗?

294
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,878
Four if you count D'Artagnan,
算上达达尼昂是四个

295
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,880
Well, nobody knows how many there were, really, do they, Pete?
没人知道他们到底有几个人 是吧 皮特?

296
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,251
You do know that The Three Musketeers is a fiction, right?
"三个火枪手"是部小说 你知道的吧?

297
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,352
Written by Alexandre Dumas?
大仲马写的?

298
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,162
A lot of people are saying that about the Bible these days.
现在很多人老这么念叨圣经

299
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,289
What, that it was written by Alexandre Dumas?
怎么了 难不成也是大仲马写的?

300
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,497
Don't be daft, Steve, it was written by Jesus.
别傻了 史蒂文 是耶稣写的

301
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,593
Oh. Anyway, five sounds much better.
噢 随便啦 五个听起来顺口些

302
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,028
I think they missed a trick only having three.
我觉得他就弄三个主角有点失误

303
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,998
'Cause you'd have five, then two could've died and they'd still have three left.
如果是五个人 可以牺牲掉两个 最后还是剩下他们仨

304
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,910
- Are we there yet?  - Let's do this!

00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,401
Oh, look. Is anyone hungry?

- 还给你家老头子打工呢 皮特?  - 是的 我现在是合伙人了

You?

Do you know how much trouble I'm already in?
你都不知道我已经一团糟了?

386
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,689
What's that supposed to mean?
你这话什么意思?

387
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,025
Hey. What the hell is this? Why are we even here?
嘿 这究竟是怎么回事? 我们为什么来这里?

388
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,628
We are here to get annihilated.
一起全军覆没

389
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,931
Have you got any plans for dinner at all?
晚上有什么想吃的吗?

390
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,867
Tonight, we will be partaking of a liquid repast
今天晚上 我们要完成豪饮马拉松

391
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,236
as we wend our way up The Golden Mile.
今天晚上酒就是我们的晚餐

392
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,006
Commencing with an inaugural tankard at The First Post,
先去一号邮局 来一大桶啤酒

393
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:11,176
then onto The Old Familiar, The Famous Cock, The Cross Hands,
然后去老相识 闻名雄鸡 交叉之手

394
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,644
The Good Companions, The Trusty Servant,
好伙伴 忠仆

395
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,879
The Two Headed Dog, The Mermaid, The Beehive, The King's Head
双头猎狗 美人鱼 蜂窝 国王之颅

396
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,915
and The Hole in the Wall for a measure of the same.
然后墙洞 和上回路线一致

397
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,785
All before the last bittersweet pint in that most fateful terminus,
直到宿命的终点站 喝光最后一滴酒

398
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,053
The World's End.
世界的尽头

399
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,121
Leave a light on, good lady,
为我们留盏灯 夫人

400
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,523
for though we may return with a twinkle in our eyes,
虽然我们回来时 眼神还透着兴奋劲

401
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,731
we will, in truth, be blind drunk.
但我敢打包票 全都烂醉如泥了

402
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:49,276


403
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:50,876
Come on!
来吧!

404
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,850
- Until 1840...  - Fucking hell.
- 直到1840年...  - 去他妈的

405
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,953
this building was the site of Newton Haven's first post office.
这里还是纽顿海文第一家邮局

406
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,988
Until an enterprising business fellow decided that
一个进取的生意人发现

407
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,025
far from befitting the sending and receiving of mail
相比用来收发邮件

408
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,227
it was perhaps better suited as a humble taproom
这儿更适合做酒吧

409
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:13,005
where a weary traveler might get matted. Come on.
给疲倦的旅人歇歇脚 快进来吧

410
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,135
Ah!
啊!

411
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:18,774
It's like déjà vu.
简直是昨日重现

412
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,078
I don't remember this at all. Has it been refurbished?
我一点印象都没有 这里重装了吗?

413
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,047
Been bought by a chain, hasn't it?
被连锁店收购了 对吗?

414
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,715
Part of that nationwide initiative to rob

415
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,629
small, charming pubs of any discernible character.

416
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,198
Starbucking, man. It's happening everywhere.
好比星巴克 哥们 这种事很常见

417
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,290
Can't take away that smell, though.
不过 味道还和过去一样

418
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,959
I'm sure they tried.
我相信他们尽力了

419
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,863
- Good evening, Raymondo. The prodigal sons return.  - Eh?
- 晚上好 雷蒙多 浪子们回头了  - 什么?

423
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,443
the honor of drawing first blood.
你有幸成为第一位见证者

424

- What do you recommend?  - There's one. Crowning Glory.
- 有什么推荐的?  - 有一个还不错 至高荣耀

- So tell me more.  - About what?
- 多说点  - 关于什么?

428
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:05,250
Crowning Glory. Is it nutty? Is it foamy? Is it happy?
至高荣耀 带果仁吗? 气泡多吗? 会让人开心吗?

429
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,986
Does it have a surprisingly fruity note which lingers on the tongue?
是不是有种特殊的果味 会留香唇齿间?

430
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:10,321
- Hmm. It's beer.  - Hmm.

We'll have five of those, please.

I don't believe this,

a man of your legendary prowess drinking fucking rain.
猛男居然喝白开水

436
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,879
It's like seeing a lion eating some hummus.
简直和狮子吃豆泥一样荒唐

437
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,048
- That doesn't make any sense.  - I know it doesn't make any sense.
- 没道理  - 的确没道理

438
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,684

发生了那样的事 你还计较我不喝酒?

439
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,320
- I don't, but King Arthur does!  - Oh, this'll be good.
- 我不知道 不过亚瑟王知道!  - 噢 没准有点用

440
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:43,823
What's King Arthur got to do with it?
亚瑟王会怎么做?

441
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:47,234
Do you honestly think that King Arthur came back from the Battle of Hastings,
从黑斯廷斯战场归来后 你觉得亚瑟王

442
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:50,795
- fucking rocked up at Arthur's Castle...  - Camelot.
- 会他妈躲进城堡...  - 卡米洛特

443
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,063
walked up to the bar and went,
走向酒吧然后说

444
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,998
"Hello. Could I have a tap water?"
"你好 给我来杯自来水?"

445
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,502
No, because they didn't have running water in Arthurian times.
不会 在亚瑟王的时代 根本就没有自来水

446
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:00,505
Exactly. He would have had a mead. The King Arthur of beers.
说的没错 他会要杯蜂蜜酒 亚瑟王的啤酒

447
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,679
And I'm less of a man because I choose to drink water?
我喝水就不是男人了吗?

448
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,375
Well, it's a bit "ooh ducky", innit?
的确有点娘 不是吗?

449
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,743
That's not very PC, Gary.
加里 这么说很不友好

450
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,645
Get out of the '90s, Pete.
别整老一套 皮特

451
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,648
There's nothing "ooh ducky" about being teetotal,
戒酒一点也不娘

452
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,184
about walking into a pub after a rugby match
尤其是在橄榄球赛结束后 走进酒吧

453
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:17,655
and ordering a tap water at a bar packed full of big ugly bastards wearing warpaint.
往脸上涂着油彩混球们中间一站 然后要一杯白开水

454

That, my friend, takes confidence, yeah? I'm talking balls
那可是需要极大自信的 朋友 我有的是胆量

455
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,566
You said it, poof.
谁信啊 傻瓜

456
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:27,234
I don't know if you're aware of this, Gary, but we are not teenagers anymore.
我不知道你意识到没有 加里 我们已经不是小孩子了

457
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:29,867
And God forbid you ever have children, because if...

458
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,035
I might have kids.
我可能有孩子

459
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,538
Then you had better be ready to take responsibility...

460
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,242
No. I mean I might have kids.

461
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,786
You remember Karen Eggerton, who I fucked?
还记得卡伦・艾格顿吗 我们睡过?

462
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,713
She was two weeks late when her parents emigrated to Normandy.
他们家移民去诺曼底的时候 她月经迟到了两周

463
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:44,554
I never heard from her again. She might have had a baby.
我和她再也没联系过了 她也许有孩子了

464
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,230
Imagine that? A French kid.
想象一下? 法国孩子

465
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:48,990
It's pointless arguing with you.
简直是对牛弹琴

466
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,461
To kids. Wherever they may be.
为孩子干杯 不管他们如何

467
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:53,392
- Kids.  - Kids.

468
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:57,966
Drink up. Let's Boo-Boo.
干杯 我们嘘嘘吧

469
00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:59,630
"Boo-Boo". What is that?

You remember, "Let's Boo-Boo."
你记得 "我们嘘嘘吧"

471
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,068
You know, from Mr. Shepherd's classroom, it said on the wall,
谢菲尔德先生的课 墙上写着

472
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,671
"Exit, pursued by a bear," you know, from that Shakespeare play?
"快逃 熊追上来了" 还记得吗 莎士比亚的剧本?

- 冬日絮语  - 没错 叫什么来着?

474
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,841
A Winter's Tale. That's it.
冬日絮语 就叫这个

475
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,944
And if we needed to make a quick getaway, we'd say, "Exit, pursued by a bear,"
所以如果我们要赶紧撤 就会说 "快逃 熊追上来了"

476
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:14,947
and then it was, "Exit, pursued by Yogi Bear,"
后来就成了 "快逃 瑜伽熊追上来了"

477
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,881

然后是 "练练瑜伽嘘嘘吧"

478
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,156
and then, "Let's Boo-Boo."
最后就成了 "我们嘘嘘吧"

479
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,603
- So you're saying we should go?  - Yeah. it's shit here, isnit?
- 你的意思是 我们撤?  - 没错 这就是重点 对不对?

480
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:26,592
Ah!

00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:32,604
The Old Familiar. Now this is a pub.

Like déjà vu.
昨日重现

It's difficult to put into words.

489
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:18,287
But if I had to choose three, I would say,

It's a shame, she was a good woman.

You get lost on the ring road again?

也许有人往马桶里扔了太多纸巾

听他讲关于飞碟 蜥蜴人 还有水底纳粹的鬼话

actually being a square?

You're barred.

590
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,589
I cannot fucking believe this. This is ridiculous.
开什么玩笑 太可笑了

591
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,757
Believe me, Gary, it's not worth it.
相信我 加里 没必要啊

00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:02,432
- Have two in the next one.  - Have them all in the next one, for all I care.
- 下场双倍啦  - 要我说 下场喝透算了

We've got to have one in every pub otherwise the whole thing's fucked.
每家酒馆都要喝一杯 否则就不算数了

This is Newton Haven.

602
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,653
Hardly the heart of the organic revolution.

603
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,355
I doubt it's the heart of anything.
我怀疑这里没什么跟现代搭边的

604

My wife wanted us to go organic, problem is, I kinda like eating shit.
我老婆想让我吃有机食品 问题在于 我更加偏向吃垃圾食品

605

- 跨年狂欢 不是吗?  - 90年的新年那次

我们骗你说 你睡了一年 现在是1991年

614

That was a great night.

616
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,632
Didn't you manage to get off with Erika Leekes, Peter?
你最后把艾瑞卡・里奇斯钓走了吗 皮特?

617
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:08,600
Yes, I did. Something of a personal triumph, if I say so myself.
妥妥的搞定 我必须说 完全是人生的丰碑啊

618
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:11,629
- She of the Marmalade Sandwich fame?  - Marmalade Sandwich...
- 她是那个甜心三明治的那个?  - 甜心三明治...

619
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,631
The very same.

620
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,568
Two blondes and a redhead in the middle.
两个金发妞 夹着一个红发小魔女

- 甜心三明治  - 贝奇・索特 那身材啊

Wonder what they're doing now.

623
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,040
Why don't you ask them?
干嘛不直接问她们呢?

624
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,076
What do you mean?
什么意思?

625
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:27,745
I mean, sitting at that table over there are two blondes and a redhead in the middle.
我说 那边卡间里 两边金发 中间红发

626
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:29,113
Shut the fuck up.
真他妈见鬼

627
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,449
I'd say that's Erika Leekes on the left, Tracy Benson on the right,
我猜左边是艾瑞卡・里奇斯 右边是崔西・本森

628
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,517
and by process of elimination, there's Becky Salt in the middle.
剩下的 中间肯定是贝奇・索特

00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,453
That's the Marmalade Sandwich all growed up.
甜心三明治都成熟了啊

630

That is very spooky.

- We should get them over.  - No.

632
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,424
Leave the past where it is.
不要破坏了过去的美好啊

633
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,092
It's bad enough having to look at your old, ugly mugs.
看着你这张皱巴巴的臭脸就很扫兴了

634
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,562
You make it sound like we're fucking ancient.
你这话说的 好像我们快入土的感觉

635
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:45,596
We haven't changed that much.

- 当然啦 史蒂文身材是走样了一点  - 什么?

637

皮特的发型还是那么挫 奥利弗那鬼记号还在

It's called laser surgery, Gary.
有个东西叫做激光手术 加里

640
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,673
It's a small price to pay for not being called fucking O-Man.
为了不被叫圈仔 这代价完全忽略不计

641
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,374
That works for Sisters of Mercy tattoos as well.
这手术也能除纹身 比如你身上的仁慈姐妹

642
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,752
I still like the Sisters Of Mercy.
我可喜欢这纹身了

643
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,151
Well, good job, or you'd never go swimming.
那好的吧 你就别想游泳了

644
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,545
- I'm lost.  - Don't be.
- 我不懂你说什么  - 少装傻

645
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:04,288
Well, I for one, think it's nice to see the old faces again.
我代表我自己 很高兴再看到你们这群老家伙啊

Cheers, mate.

Excuse me? This taken?

00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:10,460
Is this seat taken?

Wasn't that... Shane Hawkins.

- Hey, didn't he...  - Yes, he did.
- 话说 他不是...  - 没错 是的

653
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,268
Hang on. What happened with Shane Hawkins again?
等等 尚恩・霍金又怎么了?

654
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:26,681
I'd rather not bring it all up again, if that's okay.
没事的话 我还是不说的好

655
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,440
Hey, man. Listen, Pete.
伙计 皮特 听着

656
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,208
Bottling up past trauma can lead to
把童年的阴影深埋在心里

657
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,512
inadequate coping strategies in later life, apparently
会对未来的生活造成很大的影响 真的

658
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,947
I don't know, I mean, it's not even about the past, you know.
我也不知道 倒不是为了过去的事情

659
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:40,150
It's not about the fact that he bullied me,
不是因为上学他欺负我

660
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,597
that he made me miss more school days than chicken pox.
他害我请假比出水痘请假还多

661
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:46,224
It's not even that he forced me to spend entire lessons hiding in a toilet cubicle,
也不是因为他强迫我整节课躲在厕所蹲坑间里

662
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,600
or that he punched me so hard he dislodged my eyeball.
也不是因为他打我打到我眼球移位

663
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,742
And it's not even that he ruined a large portion of my childhood.
也不是因为他毁了我的童年生活

664
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:57,108
No, it's the fact that just then, he didn't recognize me.
都不是 只是因为就刚刚 他竟然认不出我了

665
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:01,340
He looked straight through me like it all meant nothing.
他直直地看着我 就好像之前他完全没这么对我过一样

666
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,608
That probably sounds weird, doesn't it?

Shots!

What are you doing, Gary?

670
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,829
I thought it was obvious. Shots.
我以为这很明显啊 喝酒啊

671
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:14,552
Firstly, Peter was talking about something

672
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:15,986
which clearly made him feel very uncomfortable.
很明显让他觉得很不开心的

673
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,160
- It's all right, Andy.  - No, Peter, it's not all right.
- 没事 安迪  - 错了 皮特 怎么可能没事

674

其次 十二杯酒完全超量了 最后 我戒酒了啊!

675

But shots don't count, do they?

You said you wanted to catch up and chew the fat.

I think you just wanted to drink it.

We're not here as your friends.

We're just your fucking enablers.
我们变成你的酒友了啊

680

Gary King And The Enablers.

这个做乐队的名字正好 史蒂文 记得记下来啊

683
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,550
Don't do a Gary, Gary.
别跟加里一样 加里

684
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,679
- Oh, is that a thing now, is it?  - It's always been a thing.
- 哦 现在还有这说法了 啊?  - 这说法一直都有

685
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,414
You don't need us to help you get fucked up,
你完全不用我们来灌你

686
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,191
you've done a perfectly good job so far on your own.
你自己一个人妥妥的可以把自己灌死

687

I'm gonna go and see if there's a bus back to London

It's not the anniversary, Gary.

We did this in June. It's October.

It's just not the same anymore, Gary,

不是这镇子变了 是我们变了

好吧 但你也走不了了 因为公车最后一班刚刚开走

I should probably go and find Sam.

But you don't have what I have. Freedom.
但你们没有我的有的东西 自由

I've got full bars and I'm not getting through.
我信号满格 但我也打不通

不好意思 您的电话现在无法接通

770
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,858
Must be the network.

771
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:02,294
Holy shit. This is all connected.
该死的 这一切都是有联系的

772
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:05,829
This explains why everything's gone fuck up.
这就解释了 为什么所有事情都变样了

773
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:07,324
Everybody's been replaced by one of these.
因为每个人都被这种东西调包了

774
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:10,761
That's why no one recognized us, Basil, Dave, Raymondo.
所以他们都不认识我们 比如巴希尔 戴维 雷蒙多

的确 不管发生了什么 我们不能总躲在厕所里

Ten people have entered this toilet in the last five minutes

781
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:29,112
and not a single one has come back out again.

782
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,524
That's going to look suspicious.
这情况很容易让人怀疑的

783

Gay loving.
搞基

784
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,159
And that's worse than five dismembered bodies.

This is Newton Haven.

我们应该开上野兽 然后直奔伦敦

- 我早就醉酒了  - 你之前醉酒不也照开的吗?

安迪能开 他滴酒未沾!

799
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,088
Ah!

That's settles it then.

其次 他们可能被调包 最后 我们手上都是血

they're gonna know that we know,
他们就知道 我们知道了

I feel a little uncomfortable drinking this much.

It's like Dutch courage, isn't it?

911

Let's just get in and out of this one, yeah?

Gentlemen! The prodigal sons return!

What will it be, one of our guest ales perchance?

Might I recommend five pints of Crowning Glory?

精心酿造 口感跳脱 令人迷醉 泡沫丰富

920
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,187

You're obviously a connoisseur.

那您肯定知道能喝到这种啤酒很难得

Welcome home, boys.

926
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:11,801
I don't remember him being that friendly.

He's obviously one of them.

928
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:15,905
How can he be? He remembered me.

929
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,373
We don't know what they remember.
我们不知道他们记得什么

930
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:18,819
Maybe they have selective memories.

931
00:51:18,976 --> 00:51:20,877
Yeah, like what's his name? Me.
没错 就像 他的名字是什么? 我

932
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,812
Maybe he's one of the others. Like The Reverend.
可能他是其他人中的一员 像老圣人

933
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,156
It is very hard to tell, isn't it?
这很难分辨 对吧?

934
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,249
Yeah, I mean, is he one of them or is he one of them?
对 我是说 他是他们中的一个还是他们中的一个?

935
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,084
Wait, wait, which ones are the thems again?
等等 等等 他们是哪个他们?

Well, they're both thems, aren't they?

But there's two ways of saying it.

938
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:32,855
Is he one of them or is he one of them?
他是他们中的一个还是他们中的一个?

939
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,157
We need different terms.
我们要用不同的名称

940
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:38,129
One for the people who aren't robots and one for the robots who aren't robots.
一个指代不是机器人的人 还有一个指代自称不是机器人的机器人

941
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:44,404
All right, we need to be able to differentiate between them, them and us.
好吧 我们得能区分他们 他们和我们

942
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:46,436
Yeah, I think the pronouns are really confusing.
对 我觉得代词真的很难区分

943
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,438
Yes. I don't even know what a pronoun is.
对 我甚至都不知道代词是什么意思

944
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,506
It's a word that can function by itself as a noun
代词自身能起到名词的作用

945
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,175
which refers to something else in the discourse.
但在语境中指代其他东西

946
00:51:52,176 --> 00:51:53,519
- I don't get it.  - You just used one.
- 我没听懂它  - 你刚刚就用了一个

947
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:55,011
- Did I?  - Yeah. "It" is a pronoun.
- 是吗?  - 用了 "它"就是个代词

00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:56,045
- What is?  - It.
- 哪个词?  - 它

949

- Is it?  - Christ.
- 是它?  - 神啊

950
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,983
Look, we just need a fucking word so we can identify who's who.
听着 我们只是要找他妈的一个词而已 只要分辨谁是谁就行了

951
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:04,763
He's a blank, she's a blank, those two people are definitely blanks.
他是空壳 她是空壳 那两个人肯定也是空壳

952
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:07,668

957
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,239
What do you mean "sort of"?
"基本"是什么意思?

958
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:25,952
Well, it's weird, isn't it?
真奇怪 不是吗?

959
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:30,149
You come back and everything's the same, but sort of different.
你回来后发现一切都没变 都又有点不同

960
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,850
Different how?

961
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:33,528

残疾人洗手间

966
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:42,892
Puck's sake, Gary, take a hint.
去你妹的 加里 我没给你什么暗示

967
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,293
It's all right, I'm not trying to have sex with you.
没关系 我不是要和你做爱

968
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:45,762
Why are we in the disabled toilets then?
那我们为什么跑到残疾人洗手间里?

969
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:47,030
There's something I need to tell you right now,

unless you do want to have sex,

apart from the fact that they're twins?
除了她们是双胞胎这个事实之外?

975
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,505
Just because they're twins doesn't automatically make them creepy.
她们是双胞胎不意味着她们很惊悚

976
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,240
- It does a little bit.  - You had sex with them.
- 不 确实会有点惊悚  - 你和她们上床了

令人惊悚的就是那时好像有四个人在干我一样

00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:25,907
What's he up to?
他去干什么?

00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,472
Oh, don't worry, he's probably just trying to fuck Oliver's sister.

他说牛顿海文被机器人占领了 机器人里都是蓝色的东西

996
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:46,989
and if we don't do what they say, they will make us their prisoners.
如果我们不按照他们说的做 他们就会把我们变成奴隶

如果一切都像看上去那样神经 那么我要告诉你一些事

Another good name for the band, Steve.

- 他没有疯!  - 或许他没疯

或许他就是个空壳人 想引诱我们走到镇子边缘的

Gary's plan is still the best we have.

01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:34,187
Wait a minute
等一下

你们几个小鬼来一起坐吧? 一起喝一杯

This is not about sides, Steven.

It's not about shirts versus skins.

It's about working together as one team.

I know it may seem a bit weird and a little bit scary,
我知道有点奇怪 还有点吓人

but please believe me, it's quite the opposite,

They're here to help.

They've seen something in us, a potential.

1212
01:05:30,794 --> 01:05:33,331
There's a vast community of worlds up there,

And guess what? They want us along for the ride.

Pretty cool, eh, gang?

So, they're not here to harm us?

Far from it, O-Man. No, they're here to help.
怎么会呢 圈仔 他们是来提供帮助的

01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:55,384
I'm not saying they're afraid to get tough.
我可没说他们惧怕暴力

1219
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:58,127
I certainly had to get tough with you in my day.
过去我可被你们折腾的够呛

1220
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:01,661
And what one amongst you wouldn't thank me for it? Hmm?
难道你们中没有一个人对我表示感谢吗?

1221
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:05,227
In some respects, they're a lot like teachers.

1222

But it's all for our betterment.
但都是为了我们好

1224

我们要不要一起换个地方体面地谈谈这事儿?

1225
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:19,441
That wasn't properly?
这么谈不体面吗?

1226
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:23,083
Well, I think it's pretty clear, guys, what Mr. Shepherd is trying to say is that...
嗯 我看很显然 谢菲尔德老师是想告诉我们...

1227
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:28,025
Andy! What the fuck?

Yes, Andy. What the fuck?

Humans, you leave us no recourse.

If you will not join us willingly,

we will be forced to use other means of persuasion.

Break it up.
扯碎它

1245
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,567
It doesn't have to be like this.
完全没必要这样

1246
01:09:29,766 --> 01:09:35,808
It could be so much simpler, so completely painless.

1247
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,840
If only you'd see the light.

1248

See, it's not about conflict,

Oh, look, there's my car!

Let's climb down the drainpipe.

加里 你不是坏人 不过你不是当男朋友的料

1278
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,082
The whole "free spirit quick one in the disabled toilets" thing
"在残障厕所里快速来一发自由精神"这种事情

1279
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:30,860
is kinda cool when you're 17, but not when you're facing 40.
十七岁玩还可以 但是你现在已经奔四了

1280
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:35,335

你得成熟起来 不能再幼稚了

如果我那晚没有甩了你 现在事情就大不一样了

It doesn't have to be.
根本就不该开始

1285

We'll always have the disableds, though, won't we?

1554
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:52,998
There's only one Gary King.
只有一个加里・金

1555
01:29:54,990 --> 01:30:00,463
Then you have made your choice, Gary King of the humans.
这就是你的选择了 人类成员加里・金

1556
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:02,329
Yeah, I have.
对 是我的选择

1557
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:07,334
Because frankly, who the fuck are you to come down here and tell us what to do?
话说回来 你他妈是什么东西啊来这里指手画脚的?

1558
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:11,839
We are The Network and we are here for your betterment.
我们是网络 我们来为你们谋福利

1559
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,307
In the last 23 years,
在过去的二十三年中

1560
01:30:13,308 --> 01:30:16,289
have you not marveled as information technology has surged forward?
你难道没察觉到信息技术的爆炸式发展吗?

1561
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:17,845
No.
没有

1562
01:30:17,846 --> 01:30:22,116
Earth has grown smaller yet greater as connectivity has grown.
随着沟通的增强地球本身变得小而精彩

1563
01:30:22,117 --> 01:30:25,719
This is our doing and it is just the beginning.
这是我们的杰作 这仅仅是个开始

1564
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:28,223
Oh, fuck off, you big lamp.
哦 得了吧 大灯泡

1565
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:31,699
You are children and you require guidance.
你们是孩子 你们需要教导

1566
01:30:32,193 --> 01:30:33,831
There is no room for imperfection.
不能容忍瑕疵的存在

1567
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:37,837
Hey, Earth isn't perfect, all right? And humans aren't perfect.
地球本不完美 好吗? 人类本不完美

1568
01:30:37,999 --> 01:30:40,377
And guess what? I ain't perfect.
知道吗? 连我也不完美

1569
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:43,837
And therein lies the necessity for this intervention.
因此才需要我们的介入

1570
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:48,442
Must the galaxy be subjected to an entire planet of people like you?
难道银河要受制于你们这种人所管理的地球吗?

1571
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:51,686
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
哇 哇 等等

1572
01:30:51,913 --> 01:30:54,114
Who put you in charge, huh?
凭什么你说了算 啊?

1573
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:56,425
Who are you to criticize anyone?
你有什么资格评判别人?

1574
01:30:56,685 --> 01:30:58,892
Now, you might think Gary's a bit of a cock,
你也许觉得加里是个混球

1575
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:02,798
and he is a bit of a cock, but he's my cock.
虽然他确实有点混 但我喜欢

1576
01:31:02,924 --> 01:31:04,358
Oh, thanks, man.
谢谢 哥们

1577
01:31:04,359 --> 01:31:09,063
But he is a detriment to himself, just as Earth is a detriment to the galaxy.
但他损害了自己的利益 地球也在损害着银河的利益

1578
01:31:09,064 --> 01:31:10,197
What did you say?
你说什么?

1579
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:14,169
You act out the same cycles of self-destruction again and again.
你们无数次实行着毁灭自己的行为

1580
01:31:14,269 --> 01:31:19,241
At this point your planet is the least civilized in the entire galaxy.
如今整个银河中你们的星球是文明程度最低的星球

1581
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:22,250
- What did he say?  - He's saying we're a bunch of fuck-ups.
- 他说什么?  - 他说我们是一群该死的蠢货

1582
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:25,980
Hey, it's our basic human right to be fuck-ups.
做蠢货是我们的基本人权

1583
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:30,154
This civilization was founded on fuck-ups. And you know what?
这个文明就是蠢货建立的 你知道吗?

1584
01:31:30,285 --> 01:31:32,753
- That makes me proud.  - And me!
- 我为此而骄傲  - 我也是!

1585
01:31:32,754 --> 01:31:35,530
What is it they say? "To err is..."
那句话怎么说来着? "人非圣贤"

1586
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:37,157
"To err is human."

1587
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:40,696
"To err is human," so, uh...
"人非圣贤孰能无过"所以 嗯...

1588
01:31:41,763 --> 01:31:44,631
We do not believe you speak for all humanity.
我们认为你们不能代表全体人类

1589
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:47,768
You are but two men. Two drunk men.
你们只有两个人 两个醉鬼

1590
01:31:47,769 --> 01:31:49,442
Three drunk men!

1591
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:52,506
Stevie-baby!
史蒂文宝贝!

1592
01:31:54,476 --> 01:31:57,923
Enough! Enough, humans!
够了! 够了 人类!

1593
01:31:58,546 --> 01:32:03,450
Oh, you are in trouble now. It's only the fucking Three Musketeers.
哦 你麻烦大了 三个火枪手到齐了

1594
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:07,388
You are revolting against the wisdom of countless solar systems.
你们这是要背叛无数星系的智慧生命

1595
01:32:07,389 --> 01:32:08,834
Yeah, we are revolting!
没错 我们就是要背叛!

1596
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:12,630
You just said you're not here to conquer. Can I just ask,
你刚刚说你不是来征服的 让我问问你

1597
01:32:12,794 --> 01:32:15,638
how many people did you have to replace in Newton Haven?
你在纽顿海文替换掉了多少人?

1598
01:32:15,797 --> 01:32:17,470
- That is irrelevant.  - Is it?
- 与此无关  - 是吗?

1599
01:32:17,966 --> 01:32:21,880
Hands up. Who here is human?
举手 这里谁是人类?

1600
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:24,907
- I'm human.  - One!

1601
01:32:25,907 --> 01:32:27,682
- And me.  - That's two.

1602
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:30,277
I am. But don't know for how long.

1603
01:32:30,278 --> 01:32:31,845
- Basil!  - Shh...
- 巴希尔!  - 嘘...

1604
01:32:31,846 --> 01:32:35,649
So what's that? Three? You had to replace an entire town?
怎么样? 三个人? 你把整个镇的人都替换了?

1605
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:36,950
Not the entire town.

1606
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:40,320
Everybody apart from old Nutbowl and the Shifty twins.
包括纳特博尔和谢夫迪双胞胎的所有人

1607
01:32:40,321 --> 01:32:42,356
That's a good name for a band, Gary. You should write that down.
这名字用在乐队上不错啊 加里 你该记下来

1608
01:32:42,357 --> 01:32:44,425
I will. What about the ones you replaced,

1609
01:32:44,426 --> 01:32:45,959
like Peter and Oliver?

1610
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,328
Yeah, what happened to the empties?

1611

I told you not to ask that!
告诉过你别问这个!

1612

Redundant vessels are recycled, mulched and converted into fertilizer,
废容器被回收利用转化为肥料

1613
01:32:54,002 --> 01:32:57,471
whereupon they are returned to the earth to promote verdancy and growth.
他们被归还给土壤用于绿化

1614
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:00,207
It is a highly efficient means of organic renewal.

1615
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:01,508
Mulched?
做肥料?

1616
01:33:01,509 --> 01:33:03,911
It is a relative few in light of our long-term plan.
根据我们的长远规划 这只是一小部分

1617
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:07,247
You mean a few hundred thousand turned to fucking compost?
你是说有那么几十万人被你们做成该死的农家肥了?

1618
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:09,583
What about the other places? The penetration points.
那其他那些地方的人呢? 其他那些渗入点?

1619
01:33:10,718 --> 01:33:12,686
Are they as successful as Newton Haven?
都像纽顿海文这么成功吗?

1620
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:15,689
Because I'm guessing we're not the only glitch in your system.
因为我觉得 你系统里不听话的人不止我们几个吧

1621
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:19,160
It is true, The Network has been experiencing some difficulties.
是的 网络的确面对过一些挫折

1622

I think you bit off more than you can chew with Earth, mate.
我猜你们觉得地球没有那么容易被搞定 对吧?

and I am not just talking about Gary.

1626
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:31,105
Yeah, there's more than one Gary King.
是的 他这样的人还多得是

1627
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:34,053
- But you said...  - I fucking know what I fucking said!
- 但你们说过...  - 我知道我说过什么!

1628
01:33:34,209 --> 01:33:38,345
Your reliance on profanity is a measure of your immaturity as a man and a species,
你们对亵渎的依赖说明了你们作为人或者是物种都是不成熟的

1629
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:42,590
Why don't you just get in your rocket and fuck off back to Legoland, you cunts!
你干嘛不滚回你的火箭飞回你们的天国去呢 蠢货!

1630
01:33:42,717 --> 01:33:46,520
- Yeah! Stop fucking Starbucking us, man!  - Yeah!
- 对! 别想在这里开连锁店!  - 就是!

It is our duty to challenge you.
转化你们是我们的责任

1632
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:51,125
Just leave us to our own devices, you intergalactic arseholes.
我们的事我们自己说了算 混账!

1633
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:52,726
- You misunderstand.  - Shut up!
- 你们误会了  - 闭嘴!

1634
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:54,595
- We are trying...  - Nobody's listening!
- 我们试图...  - 我不听我不听!

1635
01:33:54,596 --> 01:33:55,662
If you'd only...
如果你们...

1636
01:33:55,663 --> 01:34:00,874
Face it, we are the human race and we don't like being told what to do.
面对吧 我们是人类 我们不需要别人教我们怎么做

1637
01:34:03,238 --> 01:34:05,309
Just what is it that you want to do?
你们想要的到底是什么?

1638
01:34:06,241 --> 01:34:08,408

And we want to have a good time.
想玩个痛快

1643
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:17,526
And that's what we're going to do.
我们就是这样

1644
01:34:18,553 --> 01:34:21,088
It is pointless arguing with you.
简直是对牛弹琴

1645
01:34:21,089 --> 01:34:24,127
You will be left to your own devices.
你们自己做主吧

1646
