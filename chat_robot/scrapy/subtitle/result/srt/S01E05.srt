00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:03,294
星际之门亚特兰蒂斯 前情提要
PREVIOUSLY ON STARGATE ATLANTIS

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,923
Sheppard少校？！
Sheppard少校，这些都是谁？！
Major Sheppard?!
Major Sheppard who are all these people?!

3
00:00:06,964 --> 00:00:09,300
我叫Teyla Emmagan
是Tughan的女儿
I am Teyla Emmagan Daughter of Tughan

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,553
如果幽灵的触角没有到达你们的世界
那你们应该回到那里
If the wraith have never touched
your world you should go back there.

5
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,472
我们也想啊，但是我们办不到
Oh we'd like to but we can't.

6
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:17,808
我还没见过这种生命体
居然可以像我们一样自然死亡
I don't see a life form like this ever
dieing of natural ageing the way we do.

7
00:00:17,808 --> 00:00:20,353
你侵入我们的捕食域
You trespassed upon our feeding ground.

8
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,231
你不知道你做了一件多么愚蠢的事情
You don't know what you have done.

9
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,496
这里是Sheppard少校的情报与指挥中心
Its Major Sheppard's IDC

10
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:40,581
他们离开也才几个小时
They've only been gone a few hours.

11
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:43,751
亚特兰蒂斯，我是Sheppard
我们正加速赶到
Atlantis, this is Sheppard we're coming in hot.

12
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:47,296
放下防御体系
Lower the shield

13
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:13,072
升起防御体系
Raise the shield.

14
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,408
Mckay！
McKay!

15
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:23,082
医疗队到门厅来
Medical team to the gateroom!

16
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,751
感觉有脉搏
I got a pulse

17
00:01:39,223 --> 00:01:40,516
你感觉怎么样？
How you feeling?

18
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:46,522
我不能说话了 你确实不能说话啊


You can't talk either

19
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,195
你身体里的感觉和运动
神经系统处于超负荷状态
Your body experienced a full overload
to its sensory and motor nervous system?

22
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,988
Ah quwat?

20
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,283
你脸上中了幽灵的击昏器
You took one of those wraith
stunners right in the face?

24
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,368
It's really quite fascinating actually;

21
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,788
幽灵的武器使你的神经元麻痹
那些神经元可使……
the wraith weapon impedes a fire of neurons
that enables the necessary---

22
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:03,789
什么？
Quwat?

23
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:08,169
麻痹是暂时的
别担心，Rodney
The paralysis is only temporary.
Don't worry Rodney.

24
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,087
不久你就可以起床走动了
You'll be up and about in no time.

25
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,717
真幸运，这种幽灵武器是设计来 否则他死定了
麻痹人的
Bloody good thing that wraith weapon
is only designed to incapacitate?

30
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,717
or he's be dead

26
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:16,177
什么？
Quwat?

27
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:19,597
少校，可以请你过来一下吗？
Major? Could I see you for a second?

28
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:27,855
Allo? Allloooo?!
Allo? Allloooo?!

29
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:30,066
他会没事的……
He's going to be fine...

30
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:34,362
我听说……
我想知道到底都发生了什么……
I've heard...
I want to know what happened out there...

31
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,988
还不是老样子……
The same old thing...

32
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:39,200
也就是说你们在几次任务里就
Which makes it the fifth time
your teams encountered the wraith

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,452
碰到了5次幽灵？
out of... how many missions?

34
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,788
9次
nine...

35
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:47,375
所以这应该不是巧合
so... probably not a coincidence.

36
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:52,004
我想这已经非常明显了
这里有间谍
0
I think it's pretty damn obvious now.
We've got a spy in Atlantis.

37
00:03:52,752 --> 00:03:58,629
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季第5集 疑云重重
Season 1 : Episode 5
Suspicion

38
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,039
你能不能不要在这挠脚？
Could you please not do that here?

39
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,041
十分抱歉，但我的脚麻得受不了了
My foot is still numb, if you'll excuse me...

40
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,794
看来至少你的口齿还挺灵的嘛
Well at least your mouth still works fine

41
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,425
好了，我们开始吧
Alright let's get started.

42
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,684
不等Teyla了吗？
Shouldn't we wait for Teyla?

43
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,187
Teyla不在与会之列
Teyla wasn't invited.

44
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,855
她是我队里的一员
She's a member of my team

45
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,482
她也是Athosian人
She's also an Athosian sir.

46
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,191
然后呢？
So?

47
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,068
如果我们保持妥协
有许多证据证明我们……
If we've been compromised and
every indication suggests that we have...

48
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,571
几乎可以肯定有人是有嫌疑的
It is almost certain that one of them is responsible

49
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,948
我们在说Teyla……
We're talking about Teyla...

50
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,074
我也不想这样，少校
I don't like it either Major...

51
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,367
好啊，那就把她请来
Good then get her on in here

52
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,455
但我现在必须先考虑这个基地
以及人员的安全
but the safety of this base and its personnel
are my main concern... right now.

53
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,207
原本这是你的责任
As it should be yours.

54
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,587
幽灵在你们的队伍拜访过
的9个星球中的5个出现
The wraith have shown up on the last five
of the nine planets you team has visited

55
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,632
而且根据掌握的情况
其中有两个星球是无人居住的
and given the fact that two
of those world were unpopulated...

56
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:03,053
所以我们可以极其肯定一定是
有内贼向他们通报了你们的行踪
we can pretty much assume that they have been
alerted to your missions by someone on this base.

57
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,971
如果这个基地里有人和
幽灵保持联络
If someone on this base was
communicating with the wraiths...

58
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,890
那为什么亚特兰蒂斯没有被攻击？
then why hasn't Atlantis been attacked?

59
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,142
说的好
Good point...

60
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,145
也许我们该无限期的停止
星际门的使用
Maybe we should just stop
using the Stargate indefinitely

61
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,730
——不能这样
——为什么？
- We can't do that...
- Why not?

62
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,565
因为我们需要ZPM来给这里提供能量
Because we need ZPMs to power this place.

63
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,317
一切似乎都运转良好
Things seem to be running fine right now...

64
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,947
OK……如果幽灵真的出现……
他们会的……我们要怎样进行防御？
Ok... When the wraith do show up...
And they will... How do we defend ourselves?

65
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,698
更远一点说，这还关系到
我们回地球的事情
Or for that matter how do we get back to earth?

66
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:27,160
这是飞马星系中唯一能跟地球
连接的星际门
This is the only Stargate in the Pegasus
Galaxy that can even reach earth...

67
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:31,498
如果真的到了那一步，我们就得
在幽灵占领城市之前使用自毁系统
and if it comes to that we're going to have to use
the self destruct before the Wraith take the city.

68
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,001
底线是：我们能使用星际门
Bottom line: We need to use the gate.

69
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,712
所以我们要尽快找出谁是主谋
Then we've got to find out who's responsible ASAP.

70
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:42,509
我建议我们先把无关人员
限制在南部区域活动
I suggest we start by confining all non-base
personnel to the south side of the complex.

71
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,760
你是在说笑吗？
Are you kidding?

72
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,012
那是我们至少应该做的事情
如果Sumner上校还在这里的话……
That's the absolute minimum we should do.
If Colonel Sumner was still here...

73
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,305
他不在
He's not.

74
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,518
而我在
I am.

75
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,311
是的，长官
Yes sir.

76
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,566
我们不打算像对待犯人一样
对待我们的战友
We're not going to start treating
anyone like prisoners...

77
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,693
嗯，不错
Well, that's good.

78
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,528
你意味着
That said.

79
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:05,991
应该采取措施加强
敏感区域的防范
Steps should be taken to safeguard
the more sensitive areas of this facility.

80
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,909
这才是合理的
It's only reasonable.

81
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,163
我建议禁入区先从星际门控制台
I recommend that no go zones
start with Stargate operations,

82
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,874
实验室，能量发生器
以及探险者号开始
the labs, power generation and the Jumper bay.

83
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,460
我想见一下基地上所有的Athosian人
I'd like to meet with every Athosian on this base.

84
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:17,878
我是说他们来这儿已经3个月了
I mean they've been here three months...

85
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,337
我只知道其中一些人的名字
I only know a handful of them by name,

86
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,631
这里一结束
我就可以安排好会面
I could start setting up interviews
as soon as we're done here...

87
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:27,387
同时……所有的使用
星际门的活动都暂停，直到有新通知
In the mean time...
all gate travel is suspended. Until further notice.

88
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,191
对不起，女士
你不能上去
Sorry ma'am you can't come up...

89
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,776
我要去见Weir博士
I'm on my way to see Dr Weir.

90
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,694
这里是限制区
That area's of limits.

91
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:45,864
什么时候开始的？
Since when?

92
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,494
我相信一定是有误会了
I believe there has been
some sort of misunderstanding...

93
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:54,790
有个会议没通知我……
I... was unaware a meeting had been called...

94
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,708
我们边走边说
Lets take a walk...

95
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,421
怎么了？
What is happening?

96
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,049
亚特兰蒂斯上可能有人泄密
There may be a security leak on Atlantis.

97
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,300
你确定？
Are you certain?

98
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,178
不是十分确定……但很确定
Well Not certain certain... but pretty certain.

99
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,014
也就是说我们必须采取临时
的警备措施
It means we're going to have
to take temporary precautions.

100
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,349
比如说？
Such as?

101
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,559
嗯……比如……停止使用星际门
Well...like uh... suspending gate travel,

102
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:19,815
加强保安
认识你们的人……更多一些
tightening security...
getting to know your people... better

103
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,609
你们怀疑Athosian人？
You suspect an Athosian?

104
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,779
Weir博士想见他们
就这样，没有针对个人
Dr Weir wants to meet them...
that's all... it's nothing personal.

105
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,783
呃……我是说……
她想亲自见见你们
Well... well I mean it is...
in the sense she wants to meet them all personally

106
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,036
你也十分清楚我们世代
遭受幽灵的侵袭所承受的苦痛
You're aware of the horrors generations
of my people have faced at the hands of the wraith...

107
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,497
就算这样你还怀疑他们的忠诚……
and yet you would still question their loyalty...

108
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,957
喂，Teyla，不能这么说
Come on Teyla... that's not fair...

109
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,960
你们的人在亚特兰蒂斯活动
而许多她都没见过
You've got people running around
Atlantis that's she's never even met.

110
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,797
我知道每一个人
我愿意性命担保他们是清白的
I know each and everyone of them.
I would stake my lives on their innocence

111
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:50,679
OK……也许你也注意到了
每次我们通过星际门的时候那些坏家伙就来攻击我们
ok... well perhaps you've noticed that every time
we step through the Stargate bad guys try to kill us.

112
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,057
我对此有些感到厌烦了……你呢？
and I'm getting a little tired of it... How bout you?

113
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,058
那也不意味着……
That does not mean-

114
00:07:55,058 --> 00:08:00,689
看……我们所需要的……
只是一点配合，这就够了
look... all we're asking for...
is a little cooperation that's all.

115
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,240
我们会合作的
You shall have it.

116
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,742
Halling
Halling

117
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,870
Jintu近况如何？
How's Jintu?

118
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,249
他一直限制在生活区活动，一切都很好
Well enough for a boy confined to his living quarters.

119
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:25,630
对不起，这是暂时的
但也是必须的预防措施
I'm sorry, it's temporary
but it is a necessary precaution.

120
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,507
我知道
So I've heard.

121
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:32,471
那么我猜你也知道
我们为什么安排这些会议了
Then I assume you know why
we've arranged these meetings...

122
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,016
跟我们的人不能到别的星球以及
不能去这个城市的别的区域的原因是一样的
For the same reason my people
can no longer go off-world or...

123
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,852
你们不再相信我们了
enter parts of the city. You no longer trust us.

124
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,564
没错，Halling
我们不知道该相信谁
Truth Halling. We don't know who to trust.

125
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,986
关于外星探索的消息显然已经
被泄露给幽灵了
Information regarding some off-world excursions
has obviously found its way to the wraith.

126
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,112
显然？
Obviously?

127
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,532
他们不可能遍布整个星系
而守株待兔
They can't be lying and waiting
in every corner of this galaxy.

128
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,077
他们在跟踪我们的行动
我们现在必须查清楚
They are tracking our movements
and we have to find out how.

129
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,623
我们十分需要你们的配合
Your help with this will be greatly appreciated.

130
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,419
那么究竟……我要怎样才能帮的上忙？
Then by all means... how can I be of assistance?

131
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:05,837
谢谢
Thank you

132
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,423
自从你来到亚特兰蒂斯以来
你已经参加了3次外星探索了？
Since you've been here on Atlantis...
You've been off-world three times?

133
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,803
是的，我曾经作为向导参与了
Stackhouse军士长的勘测队
Yes I've been acting as a guide on behalf
of Sgt Stackhouse's reconnaissance team...

134
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:17,933
帮助他们和我们之前的交易伙伴
进行沟通
helping to establish relations between your people
and some of our former trading partners.

135
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:22,104
Stackhouse报告说在几次出外活动中
他和你失散了
Stackhouse reported he lost track
of you on a couple of these outings...

136
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,648
我是去看望了些老朋友
I did take the time to visit some close friends.

137
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:29,820
有意思。你出去3次有2次
一天后我们就被幽灵攻击了
Interesting. Two of your three visits predated
wraith attacks by approximately a day

138
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:30,695
军士
Sergeant.

139
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,614
——你是在暗示什么呢？
——我没有暗示什么
- What are you suggesting?
- I'm not suggesting anything.

140
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:36,284
你认为我会背叛我自己的人民？
危害我儿子的性命？
You think I would betray my own people?
Jeopardize the life of my son?

141
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,703
没有人在进行指控
No one is making accusations

142
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:42,541
我不同意。你们已经直接下结论
是有Athosian人泄密了
I disagree. You have already leapt to
the conclusion that an Athosian is responsible.

143
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,377
因为这不可能是我们的人干的
Because it can't possibly be one of our own people...

144
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:46,795
不
No.

145
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,884
我们只想弄清一些事情
We just need to clarify a few things.

146
00:09:54,428 --> 00:10:01,351
那么听我说……在一次幽灵的对
我的家园的攻击中，我失去了最好的朋友
Then allow me... I lost my closest friend in the wraith
attack that forced us from our home world.

147
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,772
Sellena，在我之前被你们问话的那个女人
失去了她的双亲
Sellena, the woman you spoke to before me,
lost both her parents.

148
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,066
事实上，你很难找到一个
In fact, you'd be hard pressed to find an Athosian

149
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,027
没有因为幽灵的攻击而造成创伤的Athosian人
that has not experienced loss at the hands of the wraith.

150
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,408
这就是你们正在指控的人！
These are the people you accuse.

151
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,954
我们没有指控任何人
We're not accusing anyone.

152
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:29,504
并且我来这儿是来接受采访的
而不是审问
And I came here expecting an interview...
Not an interrogation.

153
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:45,061
我认为这不是很……
I mean I don't think it's too much to ask...

154
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,062
什么？
What is it?

155
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,106
没什么……没什么……
nothing... nothing...

156
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,193
就是不能忍受日复一日的
吃同样的饭菜
Just can't bear the same meal
day after day after day...

157
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,488
振作些
我正在诊断
Well buck up a little...
I'm trying to run a diagnostic.

158
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:55,697
对不起
Sorry.

159
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,409
我是说……我们被困在另一个星系
只有有限的资源
I mean... we are stranded with limited
resources in another galaxy.

160
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:03,997
拜托，最近的一家bob-big boys在3百万光年远
我们需要……
Come on the nearest bob-big boys is three hundred
million light-years away... we have to make do...

161
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,625
如果你想连续两天吃掉我最喜欢的东西
那你就吃吧
If that means you have to eat my favorite
food two days in a row... so be it.

162
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,168
你喜欢吃那些军队供给的食物吗？
You enjoy military rations?

163
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,879
我知道……这很奇怪
医院的东西我也喜欢
I know... it's weird... Hospital food too.

164
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:15,300
我不喜欢飞机上的食物的唯一原因是
我不能要两份的，我是一个……
The only reason I don't like aero plane food
is you can't get seconds and I'm an absolute...

165
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,384
Hello...
Hello...

166
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,512
怎么了？
What is it?

167
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,597
这是一个我从未见过的
命令子路线
Well it's a command sub routine
I've never seen before...

168
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,225
什么功能？
What is it's function?

169
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,228
不知道，因为我从未见过这玩意儿
I don't know... because I've never seen it before.

170
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,774
OK，我去对照一下控制室里的
和这有关的远古数据库
Ok, I'm going to cross reference this with
the ancients data base up in the control room...

171
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,734
我要去找那个……
I'm just going to grab the a...

172
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:34,736
你碰了什么？
What you touch?

173
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,863
——没有，没有……
——不，你刚刚……
——不，没有，我没有
- nothing nothing...
- No you were just...
- No no no I didn't.

174
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,556
我不知道顶棚还可以这样
I had no idea the roof could do that.

175
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,516
我也是
Neither did I...

176
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,941
门厅和休闲区对我们关闭了
The gateroom and surrounding
sections have been closed to us.

177
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:16,486
而且我们再也不能在没有护卫的情况下
进医疗室了
And we may no longer have access
to the medical facility without escort.

178
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,656
我们被时刻监视着
行动被限制
We're under constant surveillance...
our movements restricted.

179
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,116
我们这样要忍多久？
How long must we put up with this?

180
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,868
已经太久了
It has already been to long...

181
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,625
我想我应该被邀请到你们的讨论中来
I would have been expected
to be included in this discussion...

182
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,462
因为我们期望你能对我们的防守措施
表明态度
As we would have expected you
to take a stand in our defense...

183
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,797
他们已经采取措施来保护
基地的所有人
They have taken action
to defend everyone on this base.

184
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:40,552
这也包括你们每一个人
幽灵的内贼的存在对我们每一个来说都是威胁
That includes each and every one of you.
The presence of a wraith collaborator threatens us all.

185
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,346
那么你支持Weir博士对我们
的禁行令了？
Then you support Dr weir's decision to confine us?

186
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,849
Halling……我们是他们的客人
Halling... we are their guests.

187
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:49,603
现在我们更像是囚犯……
但和囚犯不同的是……
We've become more like their prisoners...
but unlike prisoners...

188
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,230
我们可以选择离开
we can choose to leave.

189
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,523
你们要去哪里？
Where would you go?

190
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,901
你为什么没说“我们要去哪里”？
Do you not mean to say "Where would we go?"

191
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:01,072
在其他星球上也有朋友
他们一定很欢迎我们的
We have friends on other worlds
who would gladly take us in...

192
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:05,076
住多久？好的贸易伙伴并不一定
是好客的主人
For how long? Good trading partners
do not necessarily make good hosts...

193
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,661
这里有很多星球
There are many worlds among these stars.

194
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,455
幽灵已经唤醒了
没有哪个星球是安全的
The wraith have awakened... no world is safe.

195
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,123
留下也不安全
nor is it safe to remain...

196
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,667
他们会一直这样下去
直到找到替罪羊为止
They will continue to do this until
they find someone to blame.

197
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,754
你打心里知道我们中间
不会有叛徒的
You know in your heart that none of
our people could be responsible for this...

198
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:17,672
当然
Of course.

199
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,966
那我们就没什么好怕的
Then we have nothing to fear.

200
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,805
你真的这么相信Weir博士？
You trust Dr Weir that much?

201
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,972
是的
I do.

202
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,558
——胜过相信自己的人民？
——不！
- More that you would trust your own people?
- No!

203
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,645
我知道她的责任感
I understand her responsibility

204
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,855
Hallin
Hallin

205
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:38,985
我们一次次的碰到幽灵出击
那么经常而迅速
We have met with the wraith offworld
so often and so quickly...

206
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,446
一定有个原因，而不是巧合
there must be a reason beyond coincidence...

207
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,740
让他们查清楚吧
Give them a chance to find it.

208
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,088
他们的有些措施我也不赞成
I do not a approve of some of their measures...

209
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,591
但是我知道最终他们
会证明我们是清白的
but I do know in the end they
will help to prove our innocence.

210
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:06,221
亚特兰蒂斯不单是个避难所
它承载着希望
Atlantis is far more than shelter. It is hope.

211
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,975
不单对我们的人民
而且对每一个跟幽灵抗争的人们
Not only for our people but for everyone
who would stand against the wraith.

212
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,646
我们不应该放弃希望
We must not abandon that hope.

213
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:21,278
他们也许会定居在这儿，Teyla
但他们不是祖先
They may reside here Teyla
but they are not the ancestors.

214
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,780
不管你有多么愿意他们是
No matter how much you wish them to be.

215
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:31,872
长官
Sir.

216
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,373
Ford...
Ford...

217
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,209
我听说他们在探险者号发射台那儿
打开了天棚
Heard they got a sun roof open on the jumper bay...

218
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,085
没错
Yep...

219
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,004
我也听说你计划乘坐探险者号从那儿出去
Also heard you're planning to take a Jumper out...

220
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,215
我想那正是天棚的作用
I figure that's what the door on the roof is for...

221
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,217
其他人带枪了吗？
Anyone else call shot gun?

222
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,304
只是开出去看看而已
Just gonna drive around the planet check it out...

223
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,222
只是出去看看
Oh you're just checking out the planet...

224
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,516
哦，这样啊
我是说这很酷
oh never mind then that's cool I mean...

225
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,269
比出去看看我又更好的事在等着我去做
I've got better things to be doing
than cruising around the planet in a space ship.

226
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,940
你真像个孩子
你知道吗？
You're like a kid you know that?

227
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,943
是的，长官
我带了些飞行中可以吃的东西
Yes sir.
I brought along something to eat on the ride...

228
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:02,861
什么？
What's that?

229
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:05,280
来个美味的……火鸡三明治怎么样？
How about a nice... turkey sandwhich...

230
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:08,158
我们走
Lets go.

231
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,206
不管是谁，把下一个叫进来
Send in whoever's next please...

232
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,383
Teyla
Teyla

233
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,928
我没想到是你
I wasn't expecting you.

234
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,138
我很惊讶你的名单里没有我
I was surprised to be left of your list...

235
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,558
我认为你不需要询问了
I didn't feel it was necessary in your case...

236
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:39,606
相反，你应该先询问我
On the contrary you should have spoken to me first...

237
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,615
你是对的，我本该这么做
You're right... I should have.

238
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,785
我可以告诉你有关我的人民
的任何事情
I can tell you anything you need
to know about my people...

239
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,746
有没可能你并不像你自己
以为的那样了解你的人民？
Is it possible you don't know
them all as well as you think?

240
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,961
Weir博士，我和你有同感
I empathize with you Dr Weir...

241
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:05,757
作为领导者，我们时常要做出
艰难的抉择
As leaders we are often forced to make difficult
decisions in the interests of those we serve...

242
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:10,512
但是有很多Athosian并不是十分
理解
But many of my fellow Athosian
are not so... understanding...

243
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,099
我知道
但现在我对此无能为力
I know...
But there's nothing I can do about that now...

244
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:17,936
他们可以随意猜测我
调查他们的动机
People can suspect my motives
for these meeting all they want.

245
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,814
但你和我必须承认
我们之间有矛盾
But you and I need to agree that we have a problem...

246
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,401
我必须尽全力彻底查清楚
I have to do what ever I can to get to the bottom of it

247
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:28,155
现在这一步就是坐下来
和这里的每一个人会面
and right now that means sitting down
and talking to every single person here...

248
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,491
你该知道有离开亚特兰蒂斯的言论产生了
You should know there is talk of leaving Atlantis

249
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,041
我可不希望见到那一幕发生
I hope it doesn't come to that.

250
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,090
不是所有的改变都是百无一利的
Not all change is for the worst...

251
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,359
把探险者3号送到发射台上
Flight this is Jumper three we are go for bay launch.

252
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,366
探险者3号可以起飞
Jumper three you are good to go.

253
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,577
是的
Yes we are...

254
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,799
很奇怪我们没有感到超重
It's strange not pulling into Gs...

255
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:35,013
是啊，有些想念那种感觉
虽然以这种加速度我们可能已经玩完了
Yeah... kinda miss it. Although at this rate
of acceleration we'd be dead by now.

256
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:35,889
是吗？
yeah?

257
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:40,811
当然……如果不消除重力影响
我们承受的超重将是我们的眼睛被压出
Oh yeah... without inertial dampening we'd
be hit by so many Gs our eyes would pop...

258
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,896
脸皮会被撕下
the skin would pull away from our faces,

259
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,190
我们的脑浆会被压到
头骨的后部
our brains would squish up to the back of our skulls

260
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:49,069
而我们的内脏会四散飞溅
and our internal organs
would be crushed into these chairs

261
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:52,155
来个三明治？
What about that sandwhich?

262
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,455
我们将采用低轨道飞行
Flight we're going to take
a low orbit around the planet.

263
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,541
我们重新连接上时会告诉你们的
We'll advise when we're back in radio range...

264
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,835
照着做，探险者三号
好运
Copy that Jumper three... Good luck

265
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,171
你知道我们还没给那个行星命名
You know we still haven't named the planet yet...

266
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,257
我相信远古人一定给它起过名字了
I'm sure the ancients have a name for it...

267
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,176
叫亚特兰蒂卡之类的怎么样？
How about Atlantica or something like that.

268
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,971
我还以为我们已经同意
你不会再给东西起名字了
I thought we agreed you weren't
going to name anything anymore?

269
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:21,685
长官
Sir...

270
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,355
那是……
Is that...

271
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,565
大陆吗？
...land?

272
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:32,070
是的……没错……
Yes...it is...

273
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,780
真不知道有多大
Wonder how big it is?

274
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,616
大
Big.

275
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:37,951
很大……
Really big...

276
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,161
巨大……
It's huge...

277
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:40,245
到底怎么个巨大法？
Define huge...

278
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,747
一千五百万平方英里
15 million square miles...

279
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,167
放弃还是占领
give or take...

280
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:48,462
那样的话就是大约……
Well that would make it approximately the size of...

281
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,213
我算不清，但听起来确实挺巨大的
I have no idea but it sounds huge...

282
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,798
需要多久能到达那里？
How long would it take us to get there?

283
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,842
用探险者号25分钟
25 minutes by Jumper from ground to ground...

284
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,597
我在南边的表格上看见有些起伏
也许他们是在用未来的滑板冲浪
I saw some sweet breakers on the south table...
there may be surfing in our futur...

285
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,266
我们需要派个队伍去对那里的
泥土和水进行取样
We should send a team
to go get soil and water samples.

286
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:04,603
没错，如果那里的土地适宜耕种
那么将会极大解决我们的食物问题
He's right if the land's arable it could solve
a lot of our food productions problems

287
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,354
事实上我在想其他问题……
Actually I was thinking of something else...

288
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,564
不是冲浪？
Not surfing?

289
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,902
不是，长官……只要Athosian人还在城市里
我们就不能恢复外星任务
No sir... We can't resume offworld missions
as long as the Athosian remain in the city...

290
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,112
所以你想把他们放到那个地方是吗
So you want to dump them on the main land

291
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:16,114
少校，听起来好像是我们把他们
拉去送死
Sound like we're sending them out to die major...

292
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,491
那你们怎么知道……
Well how the hell would you know...

293
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,243
——那里看起来很荒芜
——刚才我们还在冲浪
- It looked pretty wild down there...
- A second ago we were going surfing...

294
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:24,080
那是在我们在寻找怪物以及
Well that was after we check for monsters and...

295
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,541
臭虫和空间有关的东西以后的事情了
bugs and other space related things...

296
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,169
我不觉得那里比他们原来的
居住地要差
I can't imagine it would be worse
than their original home world...

297
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:30,962
那可能只是你的一厢情愿罢了
That could be just failure
of imagination on your part.

298
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:33,924
不管怎样，调查一下就
能得到一些我们需要的信息
And any case a survey would
tell us what we need to know...

299
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,931
你不在认真地考虑这件事情？
You're not seriously thinking about this?

300
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,893
起先我们是他们离开家园的原因
We're the reason they had
to leave their planet in the first place.

301
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,146
少校，当时情况很复杂
This is a complicated situation major...

302
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,147
你什么意思？
Well what does that mean...

303
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:52,317
我并不想排除任何一种可能
在这个节骨眼上
It means I'm not about to rule
anything out... at this point...

304
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:07,207
Weir博士
你们在这里发现了一片新大陆是真的么？
Dr weir...
Is it true you have discovered land on this world

305
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,793
是啊
Yes it is

306
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:12,462
那么我们的人民想离开
去那里开拓
Then my people wish to take our leave to explore it.

307
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,590
真的吗？
You would?

308
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,300
我们在这里不受欢迎了
We're no longer welcome here...

309
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,301
不是这样的
That's not the case

310
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:21,179
这样我们至少显得有用
因为我们不能靠近星际门
And it will make us useful as long
as we have no access to the gate...

311
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,015
我们甚至还不知道那里是否安全
We don't even know if it's safe...

312
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:27,310
我们可以为我们的人民决定
We can determine that... for both our people...

313
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:33,150
我不明白……直到现在你
一直要求进入星际门
I don't get it... up until now you have been
insisting on access to the Stargate

314
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,319
现在你又要求和星际门断绝关系
and now you're proposing to deliberately
cut yourself off from it...

315
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,821
我们不能离开
We cannot leave...

316
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,949
我们也不能留下
and we cannot stay...

317
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,453
那片新大陆给了我们第三种选择
The main land presents us with a third option...

318
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,413
我明白了
I see

319
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,956
你曾说过这只是暂时的措施
You said yourself this was a temporary measure

320
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,040
是的，当然
Yes of course...

321
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:53,211
你有办法保证亚特兰蒂斯和新大陆之间的联络
You have the means to assure us
passage between Atlantis and the main land...

322
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,922
当你决定恢复使用星际门的时候
when you decide to resume use of the gate.

323
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,092
如果我们可以恢复执行通过星际门的任务
And if we resume our missions through the Stargate

324
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:01,636
并且并不是每次都碰到幽灵
and stop encountering the wraith at every turn...

325
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:05,265
那只会证明Athosian人里有叛徒
it will only prove that there is a spy on the Athosian.

326
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,018
而如果你们还是每次都遭到
幽灵的攻击
And when you continue to encounter
the wraith at every turn...

327
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,980
那将证明我们的清白
it will only prove our innocence.

328
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,066
你们和Teyla讨论过这件事了吗？
Have you discussed this with Teyla?

329
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:19,821
Teyla已经作了决定
Teyla has made her decision...

330
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,436
我知道你不会和我们一起来
I understand you are not coming with us.

331
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:11,123
Weir博士安排好了亚特兰蒂斯和新大陆
之间的通信
Dr weir has arranged for communications
between Atlantis and the main land...

332
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,792
如果你们需要我们的帮助
Should you ever need our assistance...

333
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,585
替我们谢谢她
Thank her for us...

334
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,507
我希望……
I hope...

335
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:23,552
——我不希望你们有人认为我……
——Teyla
- I don't want anyone to believe that I'm...
- Teyla.

336
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:32,436
时候到了
The time has come.

337
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,163
保重……
Go safely...

338
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:53,457
你也是
And you...

339
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:18,231
我还从未和我的人民分开过
I've never been separated
from my people before...

340
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:22,652
这一定很难受
但你知道你一定会再见到他们的
It must be hard...
but you know you'll see them again...

341
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:27,157
你们怀疑你们回不了地球了？
You doubt that you will
one day return to earth...

342
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:29,326
我可怀疑不起
I can't afford that doubt

343
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,332
你是说你没法让事实显露出来
You mean you can not afford to let them show.

344
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:40,378
你仍然是个领导者，Teyla
You're still a leader Teyla...

345
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,340
你是为了你的人民和他们的未来
这样做的
You are doing this for
you're people and for their future...

346
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:46,384
他们知道的
They know that.

347
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,365
少校，又要穿过星际门而激动吗？
Anxious to step through the gate again Major?

348
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:10,450
——是啊
——我们都……
- Yes I am...
- We all our...

349
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:13,203
——你有什么特别的要我们带回来吗？
——呃……没有，谢谢
- You like us to bring back anything special?
- uh... no thanx...

350
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,080
杂货？新服装？餐具？
Groceries? A new outfit? Flatware...

351
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,875
嗯……不了……
我只要你们完整的回来
Hmm... no...
just yourselves in one piece please.

352
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:20,585
接通
Dial it up.

353
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:23,380
注意安全
Be safe.

354
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:50,824
有好东西？
Well good stuff?

355
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:53,410
我都不知道怎么形容有多
奇妙了
I can't even begin to tell
you how fascinating this is.

356
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:56,288
人类学的奇妙还是真的奇妙？
Anthropologist fascinating
or actual fascinating?

357
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,790
也许用奇妙形容不是很恰当
Yes well maybe fascinating isn't the right word.

358
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:01,042
也许吧
还有多久？
Maybe not.
How much longer?

359
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,754
据观测
我们差不多该回去了
Realistically.
We'll probably be needing to come back...

360
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,547
这里有太多的东西……
there's just so much here...

361
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:08,717
我知道
有什么办法可以快一些吗？
Well I can see that
is there any way to speed things up?

362
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:11,887
当然，找个可以翻译废墟上的
东西的人
well sure find me someone
who can translate some of the ruin.

363
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:15,223
你是说这里有原住民？
Did you say there were natives here?

364
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:16,892
他们是很害羞的种族
They are very shy people.

365
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,436
我们刚一穿过星际门
他们也许找地方躲起来了
They probably went into hiding
the moment we came through the gate.

366
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:22,731
有没办法可以让他们出来
帮我们一把呢？
Is there any way you can coax them out.
Have them give us a hand?

367
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:25,233
希望不大，但我试试看
It is unlikely but I could try.

368
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:28,153
中尉，和她去一趟
Ltd, go with her.

369
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:30,781
如果我单独行动会好一些
It would be better if I went alone.

370
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:32,365
你是单独的啊
You will be alone,

371
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,743
和Ford少尉
with ltd Ford.

372
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:08,819
也许他们不在附近
Maybe they're not around.

373
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:16,034
他们在附近
但对他们来说你是个陌生人
They are near
but you are a stranger to them.

374
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:19,037
只要你在这儿
他们就不会出来
They will not come out of hiding
so long as you are with me.

375
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,418
少尉，他们不是危险的人
我没事的
They are not a dangerous people Ltd.
I will be fine.

376
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:31,675
好吧，我在这等着
Alright I'll wait here.

377
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:40,809
如果有需要就呼叫我
Call me on the radio if you need me.

378
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:07,461
有幽灵！！回到星际门
WRAITH!!! Back to the Gate Now!!!

379
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:28,648
Teyla！！少校，
怎么了？
Teyla!!
Major what's the situation?

380
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:33,028
少尉，我们真交火呢
你必须绕路靠近星际门了
Ltd we're taking fire.
You're going to have to circle around
to get back to the gate.

381
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,031
Teyla不和我在一起，她去……
Teyla's not with me she went to get...

382
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:38,325
找到她，把她找回来
Find her.
Get her back.

383
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:44,122
走！
Move out!

384
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,313
Lumano！McKay！抓住少校
Lumano! McKay! grab the Major.

385
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:12,651
——那Ford少尉呢？
——快！
- What about Ltd Ford?
- Now!!

386
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:25,163
快关上星际门，他们就在我们后面
Shut it down they're right behind us.

387
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:40,595
我们必须回去
We have to go back.

388
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,347
Teyla呢？Ford少尉呢？
Teyla? Ltd Ford?

389
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:43,890
仍在那个星球上
我们现在必须回去
Still on the planet.
We have to go back now!

390
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:45,767
我反对
门那头都是幽灵！
I'd advise against it.
You have wraith all over the gate.

391
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,602
我们不能把他们留在那儿
We can't just leave them there.

392
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:52,732
有多少？
How many?

393
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,734
不好说，他们有很多人都在3线以后
Its hard to say most of them were behind the tree line.

394
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:57,195
我们在这儿是浪费时间
我们需要找营救的办法
We're wasting time here
we need to mount a rescue operation.

395
00:28:57,195 --> 00:29:00,657
博士，在没有搞清一切以前我是不会
派任何人通过星际门的
I'm not going to send anyone through
that gate until I have all the facts Doctor.

396
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:03,869
Teyla和Ford少尉是怎么和你们分开的？
How did Teyla and Ltd Ford get separated from you?

397
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,496
他们去搜索试图寻找到一些原住民
They went to check out the area and
try to make contact with some of the natives.

398
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:08,206
是谁的主意？
And whose idea was that?

399
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:12,002
我的，她是服从我的命令
Mine.
She was following my orders.

400
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:13,503
你怎么不在医疗室待着？
Shouldn't you be back at the infirmary?

401
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:17,257
不，我好了
我没有被正正得击中
No I'm fine I didn't take a full blast.

402
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,134
少校，你为什么不和他们一起去？
Why didn't you go with them major?

403
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:22,095
那个星球的居民很容易受惊吓
Well the natives of that planet are easily spooked.

404
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:24,681
Teyla说人多的话会把他们吓跑的
Teyla thought we'd scare
them off with a big group.

405
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:26,266
又是Teyla
Teyla did...

406
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:30,103
——军士，怎么了？
——我们中埋伏的时候她正巧不在
- What's that sergeant?
- She was conveniently absent during the ambush.

407
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:32,022
所以你是说Ford，是他干的？
So was Ford maybe it was him?

408
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:33,607
我只是陈述事实，长官
I'm just stating a fact sir.

409
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:37,194
军士，我只想说一遍
Sergeant I am only going to say this once.

410
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:40,447
少校，按照规矩你可以
随意的申诉我
With all due respect Major
You can reprimand me if you wish...

411
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:43,533
但你的队伍已经6次中埋伏了
but its been six times
your team has been compromised.

412
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:46,161
上次任务
只有一个Athosian人知道这件事情
Only one Athosian knew about this last mission.

413
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:53,001
我们受到一个意外的外星信号
We have an unscheduled off-world activation.

414
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:55,629
是Teyla
It's Teyla's IDC.

415
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,672
收到电波传送
Receiving a radio transmission.

416
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:00,634
我是Teyla，Ford少尉受伤了
This is Teyla.
Ltd Ford has been wounded.

417
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:02,719
幽灵和我们很靠近
The wraith are closing in on our position.

418
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:06,556
放下防御体的话，我们就门户大开
幽灵会攻进来的
You put down that shield and we could be
opening up this base to a wraith attack.

419
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:09,726
亚特兰蒂斯，让我们过去
Atlantis, please let us through.

420
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,488
Ford少尉，你能确认一下情况吗？
Ltd Ford can you confirm the situation.

421
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,616
他失去知觉了
我们快要绝望了
He is unconscious.
Our situation grows desperate.

422
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:27,035
再过一会儿我们只有冲过星际门了
别无选择
Soon we will have no choice
but to go through the Stargate.

423
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:30,288
我们放下防御体的话，谁知道
她会带些什么东西过来
We drop that shield and who knows
what she'll bring through the gate with her.

424
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,751
快把门打开！！
Open up the damn gate!!

425
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:45,637
放下防御体
Lower the shield.

426
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:09,786
如果她在给幽灵报信
那为什么把Ford带回来
If she were helping the Wraith
why bother bringing Ford back.

427
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:11,872
那为什么多次一举要回来？
In fact why bother coming back at all?

428
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,416
她在亚特兰蒂斯这儿会更有用
She's off more use to them here in Atlantis

429
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,585
那就是她假装救Ford少尉的原因
as for apparently rescuing Ltd Ford.

430
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:19,171
她把他拖回星际门
有什么假装的？
She carried him through the gate
what's apparent about that.

431
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:21,423
他失去知觉了，长官
我们还不知道发生什么了
He's unconscious sir
we still don't know what happened.

432
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:24,801
——够了
——提出安全的担心是我的本职！
- Oh that's enough
- Its my job to express security concerns.

433
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:27,888
——我已经受够了你的担心
——再一次的，按照规矩，少校
- I've heard enough of your concerns.
- Again with all due respect Major ...

434
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,765
我觉得你把你个人的感觉置于……
I believe you're putting
your personal feeling in front of your...

435
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:31,767
你可以走了
You're dismissed.

436
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:40,692
是的，长官
Yes sir.

437
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,628
怎么了？
What?

438
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:02,547
是我让他负责安全事务的
I'm the one who put him in charge of security.

439
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:04,508
是啊
Yes you did...

440
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:07,636
如果你想让我走，那就请
and if you want to dismiss me.
Go ahead.

441
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:11,932
你为什么不去看看Ford少尉怎么样了？
Why don't you go see how Ltd Ford is doing.

442
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,998
你想让我搜她的东西？
You want me to go through her stuff?

443
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:42,671
我们在找武器，话筒
录音设备
We're looking for weapons,
transmitters, recording devices...

444
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:45,799
所有超过Athosian科技水平的东西
anything that looks like its beyond
the Athosian level of technology.

445
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:47,926
如果我找不到的话
是不是还要脱光衣服检查？
And if I don't find anything
we move onto a strip search?

446
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,637
尽管做
Just do it.

447
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:02,190
我们在回去的路上
我们受到攻击
We were on our way back,
when we came under fire.

448
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:03,233
甚至没看清他们是谁
Didn't even see them.

449
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:05,360
他们向星际门进发的时候
我们又交火了
We returned fire they made for the gate.

450
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:09,072
我从背后被击中
她真是救了我一命，少校
I was shot from behind.
She saved my ass back there major.

451
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:09,948
当然
Of course she did.

452
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,618
少校，我，呃……Ford，你感觉如何？
全身发麻？
Major I oh... Ford how are you feeling
pins and needles all over?

453
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,036
哦，跟我一样
Oh yeah welcome to the club.

454
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:17,914
不，我躲过了击昏器的袭击
No sir I managed to dive out
of the way of the stun blast.

455
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:19,416
一定是回来的时候撞到了头
I must have hit my head on the way down.

456
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:22,627
——你撞到了头？
——少校，我要让你看些东西
- You hit your head?
- Major I need you to see something.

457
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:27,841
我没事
I'll be fine.

458
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:40,187
——这到底是什么？
——我知道看起来很怪
- What the hell is this?
- I know how it looks.

459
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:41,521
这是Bates警官拿来的
It was a special request from Sergeant Bates.

460
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:43,315
——我一定要揍那个臭小子一顿
——少校
- I'm gonna bust that Son of a Bitch.
- Major...

461
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:45,066
Teyla和这次意外无关
Teyla has nothing to do with this.

462
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:46,943
可事实是他是对的
The thing is he was right.

463
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,655
Bates是对的？
Bates was right?

464
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:52,991
我知道，我当时也和你一样奇怪
看这个
I know I was as surprised as you are.
Look at this.

465
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:57,746
这是她的纪念盒
是个话筒
Its her locket.
It's a transmitter,

466
00:33:57,788 --> 00:33:59,915
它在传播一个连续的信号
Its been broadcasting a continuous signal

467
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:02,459
如果我不仔细研究
我一定无法发现
I wouldn't even have noticed
if I hadn't been looking for it specifically.

468
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:04,920
——我知道了
——什么？
- I found it.
- What?

469
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:06,922
在我们第一次见面的时候
Back on her planet the first time we met.

470
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:10,383
Teyla带我到遗迹上参观
它半埋在土里，我拾起来给她的
Teyla took me to the old ruins.
That was half buried in dirt I gave it to here.

471
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:17,682
这是我许多年前丢的
I lost this years ago.

472
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,144
这个纪念盒不足发出很强的信号
传播得很远
The locket isn't powerful enough
to send a signal very far

473
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:23,021
更不用说穿越子空间
certainly not through subspace.

474
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:25,398
现在，我猜是在某些星球上有
这个设备的接收器
Now, my guess is there are probably relay
devices on certain planets

475
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,944
可以接到它发出的信号
然后报告给最近的幽灵
that probably pick up the transmission
and alert the nearest hive ship.

476
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,487
那就是我们被攻击的原因
Those were the planets we were attacked.

477
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:32,781
小伙子还欠我们一个道歉
Boy do we owe a few people an apology.

478
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:37,119
Teyla是无意识泄露了你们的行踪
Teyla had no idea
she was giving away your position.

479
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,121
她说这是她父亲给她的礼物
She said it was a present from her father...

480
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,872
她小时候把它丢了
she lost it when she was a kid.

481
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:43,750
在Sheppard少校拾起它把它激活以前
它很可能处于休眠状态
It was probably dormant until
Major Sheppard picked it up activated it.

482
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,545
如果她小时候戴过
那他们那时为什么没有受到攻击
If she wore it as a kid
why weren't they attacked back then...

483
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:48,255
我不是说它是处于休眠状态吗？
Didn't I just say it was dormant??

484
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:50,090
但你也说它一碰就可以激活了
But if it was activated by touch.

485
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,509
你没听清
我说Sheppard少校把它激活了
You're not listening.
I said major Sheppard activated it

486
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:55,595
就幽灵了解的情况看
As far as the wraith are concerned

487
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:57,139
Teyla只是另一个人类而已
Teyla is just another human being.

488
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,932
他们一定没兴趣跟踪她
They would have no interest tracking her...

489
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:01,435
——而另一方面，Sheppard少校
——拥有远古基因
- now Major Sheppard on the other hand.
- Has the Ancient gene.

490
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:05,814
没错，一方面
幽灵和远古人曾经打过仗
Exactly. Now at one point
the wraiths and the ancients were at war

491
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,608
幽灵发明了可以探测远古人的传输设备
the wraiths created a transmission
device to detect ancients

492
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:12,529
所以Athosian人认为那是不错的小饰品
SO some Athosian thought this would
make a nice little necklace.

493
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:14,614
我怎么知道？
How could I possibly know that?

494
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:16,199
我是在说什么？
重点是……
What am I answer man?
The point is...

495
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:19,786
不是Teyla也不是其他Athosian人
该对此事负责
It wasn't Teyla or any other
Athosian for that matter.

496
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:23,165
如果真是这样的话
If that's the case

497
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:27,043
我们可以将计就计
we can use it against them.

498
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:37,888
——你看起来有些紧张
——不，我也是一员，我要参与
- You seem nervous.
- No... I'm part of this team I'm doing this.

499
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:40,724
没错
我刚才是说你有些紧张
Yes you are.
I just said you seemed nervous.

500
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:42,976
哦，真的？我还以为你暗示我
不用参加了
Oh really... I thought you said Rodney
you don't have to do this.

501
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,978
——你当然要参加
——该死，我要参加
- Yes you do.
- Damn right I'm doing this...

502
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,981
我感觉我走到另一个极端了
despite the fact the feeling has
a completely turned my extremities.

503
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,739
——你迟到了
——对不起
- You're late.
- Sorry

504
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,410
既然幽灵获得了再生的能力
Now given the wraiths regenerative abilities

505
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:03,163
要杀掉他们需要花些力气
killing one requires some amount of effort.

506
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:05,499
活捉是另一项任务
Catching one alive is going
to be a whole other deal

507
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,919
就这些选择
你们要和幽灵决斗
for any of these options to work
your wraith has to be on the ground.

508
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,712
我们去拜访的上一个星球飞船无法进入
The last planet we visited was inaccessible by ship.

509
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:14,049
星际门附近的废墟会迫使
幽灵徒步过来
and the ruins around the Stargate should
force the wraith to come through on foot.

510
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:18,178
那样的话
你们就可以使用这个
In which case,
You'll be able to use these.

511
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:23,016
这是一个击昏手榴弹
This is a stun grenade.

512
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:25,560
里面填充了钠钾混合液
Its filled with a mixture of aluminum
and potassium percolate

513
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,438
点燃以后产生一个高压波
that when ignited produces a high pressure wave

514
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,566
会使目标受到剧烈的
光和声的打击
that will overwhelm the intended
target with intense light and sound.

515
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:34,653
如果那样还不能使他的头嗡嗡响
If that doesn't get his head ringing.

516
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:38,824
那么还有这个
In addition, you've got your tazer

517
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:41,576
射程15-20英尺
with a range of 15 to 20 feet

518
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:43,912
它会产生一个高压
it delivers a high voltage low Ambridge charge

519
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:47,958
限制身体的电子信号暂时的麻痹上当者
that limits the body's electrical
signals temporarily paralyzing the victim.

520
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,419
少校，我是Ford
Major this is Ford.

521
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:53,922
你找到什么了，少尉？
What you Got Ltd?

522
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:57,717
我们找到伙伴了
We've got company.

523
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:01,513
4个
Four of them.

524
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:08,603
很好，按原计划行动
Alright then we go as planned.

525
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:10,981
是的，长官
Yes, Sir.

526
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:19,573
你看起来还是很紧张
You still seem nervous.

527
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:22,075
不不不不，很好
没事的，很好
No no no, its good good.
All go, all good.

528
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:47,976
Teyla
Teyla.

529
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:32,020
这是我们要活捉的，放Tazer！
This one's ours boys. Tazers!

530
00:39:09,182 --> 00:39:13,228
自毁系统，快闪开！
Self destruct. Take cover!!

531
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:26,741
少校！
McKay博士？
Major!
Dr McKay?

532
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:33,415
你还好吧
You ok?

533
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:36,460
我没事，这……这很好玩
I'm fine. This is... this is fun for me.

534
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:03,445
放松……不要自毁了
Easy... Don't go blowing yourself up.

535
00:40:16,158 --> 00:40:18,119
Teyla，对不起
P Teyla
Excuse me.

536
00:40:18,703 --> 00:40:21,122
我原来希望能在你去
新大陆以前找到你
I was hoping to catch you before
you headed back to the main land.

537
00:40:21,163 --> 00:40:23,040
我听说他们干的不错
I hear they're doing well.

538
00:40:23,082 --> 00:40:24,166
很好
Very well.

539
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:27,336
据Halling说，他们正忙着
种下个季度的植物呢
According the Halling they're busily
planting crops for the next harvest.

540
00:40:27,336 --> 00:40:28,754
听到这我很高兴
I'm glad to hear it.

541
00:40:28,796 --> 00:40:30,756
我会告诉他们发生什么了
I will tell them what has happened,

542
00:40:30,798 --> 00:40:35,136
很快我们就都会忘了
这几星期发生的事情
hopefully in time we will all be able
to put the events of the past week behind us.

543
00:40:35,177 --> 00:40:39,348
是的，我感觉到最近几天
Yes, I am aware that the last few days

544
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:41,434
你的压力很大
have been particularly difficult for you.

545
00:40:41,475 --> 00:40:43,978
Weir博士，我相信
I believe, Dr Weir.

546
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,398
如果在你的位置上
我也会这么做的
That in your place,
I would have done the same.

547
00:40:48,524 --> 00:40:50,318
谢谢
Thank you.

548
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,812
再说一次
你们真是顽固的种族
Again,
Your kind is persistent.

549
00:41:26,812 --> 00:41:29,357
我还以为你们该放弃了
I would have thought you'd given up by now.

550
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:33,861
哦，我可有的是时间
Aww hell I've got all the time in the world.

551
00:41:33,903 --> 00:41:36,447
你却在一个陌生的地方
Now you on the other hand.

552
00:41:39,825 --> 00:41:42,286
远古人对防御层可是十分在行的
The ancients were pretty good at shields

553
00:41:42,286 --> 00:41:44,372
不是吗？
and stuff like that, weren't they?

554
00:41:45,748 --> 00:41:49,210
我给你一个星期，最多两个
I give you a week, maybe two tops.

555
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,212
浪费时间
You waste your time.

556
00:41:51,212 --> 00:41:54,048
我不会告诉你们的
I'll provide you with no information.

557
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:57,718
我在想什么更痛苦一点
被枪击还是饥饿呢？
Wonder what hurts more
the gun shot wound or the hunger?

558
00:41:57,718 --> 00:42:01,806
因为我很乐意帮忙
但我不知道McKay把食谱放在哪儿了
Because I'd love to help out
but how did McKay put it?

559
00:42:03,808 --> 00:42:07,687
估计我们没法满足您的要求
We can't meet your dietary requirements.

560
00:42:09,397 --> 00:42:14,860
一旦我自由了，你就是我的第一样食物
When I am free, you will be the first that I feed upon.

561
00:42:14,902 --> 00:42:17,530
好啊来啊
Okie dokie.

562
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:20,491
我把自己做成一个三明治好了
I'm going to go make myself a sandwhich.

563
00:42:20,533 --> 00:42:23,494
人类
Human.

564
00:42:25,413 --> 00:42:28,791
你认为抓到我就是胜利
You think you've won a victory by my capture

565
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:34,046
但把我带到这儿只会加速你们的毁灭
but by bringing me here
you've only hastened your own doom.

566
00:42:34,088 --> 00:42:36,382
只是时间问题
Its only a matter of time

567
00:42:36,382 --> 00:42:39,802
他们迟早会来救我的
before the others of my kind come to rescue me.

568
00:42:39,844 --> 00:42:42,972
等他们到了
And when they do,

569
00:42:43,014 --> 00:42:46,267
这个世界就没有你们的藏身之地了
They'll be no where in this world you can hide.

570
00:42:51,314 --> 00:42:54,483
那现在就保持乐观吧


Stay positive now.
