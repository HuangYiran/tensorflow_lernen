10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,996
没人能强迫你杀一个孩子

11
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:31,677
我只是遵照命令

12
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,854
打扰一下

13
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:53,000

00:00:56,522 --> 00:00:58,356
您需要先在前台登记

16
00:00:58,515 --> 00:01:00,116
不能直接这么进来

17
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:02,037
水龙头还开着

18
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,241
我们昨晚谈了谈

19
00:01:05,392 --> 00:01:07,316
然后我去睡觉了

20
00:01:07,476 --> 00:01:09,236
今早他就不见了

21
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:13,280
我给他的同事打了电话 但是没人知道他在哪

22
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:16,037

23

告诉我你在开玩笑
Tell me you are joking!

31

In the glove box,

40

我们每个冬天都把里面的水抽干

48

你推了他

00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,840
我梦到了
I dream it.

50
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,520
每次都是你把那个畜生推下去
And every time you shoved the bastard in

51
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,920
他的头撞到了泳池底部

我来就是想跟你说这个

57
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,680
发生这些事以后
After everything that happened,

58
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,600

60

# 到我怀里来 #

# 抛开所有恐惧 #

64
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:34,629
# 一根红线 缠绕永远 #

67
00:04:43,596 --> 00:04:46,000
《隧道谜案》第一季第六集

68
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,280
斯蒂芬・博蒙特呢
Where is Stephen Beaumont?

69
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,920
没见到他
I haven't seen him.

70
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,640
虽然都是间接证据
The evidence remains circumstantial,

71
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,880
但这个人肯定有问题
but there is something wrong with him.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,280
听着 伙计们 警员去了苏的公寓
Hey, listen up guys. Uniforms were sent to Suzy's flat

73
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,803
没人应门 
Nobody answered the door, 

74
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:12,600
邻居说没见到她
and neighbors say they haven't seen her.

75
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,800
因为她在医院
Because she is in the hospital.

76
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,320
但是前晚他们听到
But there was some noise 

77
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:17,520
房间里有声音
coming from there the night before last,

78
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,240
好像有人在打斗
some kind of fight or a struggle going on.

79
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,920
很整洁
Very tidy.

80
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,800
不像是大斗一场过
Not exactly rumble in the jungle.

81
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,720
有人清理干净了
Somebody has been cleaning up.

82
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,760
所以 要么是没打斗过
So either there was no fight,

83
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,640
要么就是非常惨烈
or it got much more serious.

84
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,080
上次 这幅画不在这儿
This picture wasn't here last time.

85
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,760
在的 我看见了
Yes it was, I saw it.

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,640
不 你看到时 是挂在那边的
No, when you saw it, it was hanging over there.

87
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,160
保持原样 这可能是犯罪现场
Stay there, we could have a crime scene.

88
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,120
安东尼・沃尔什 那个皮条客
Anthony Walsh, the pimp.

89
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,480
清洁工刚发现了他的尸体
Bin men just found his body.

90
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,440
他的头部受了重伤
He has his head quite seriously re-arranged.

91
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,280
让法医来这
Get forensics down here.

92
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,160
我们也许刚刚有了关键性证据
We may have just moved beyond the circumstantial.

93
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,920
什么时候
At what time?

94
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,200
天啊
Christ!

95

并且要从边境控制那得到确认
and get confirmation from border control.

98
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,580
禁止他离开了吗? 
Departure is prevented? 

99
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:43,800
没有 我们警告过他
No, we'd alert him.

100
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,840
警察 我们要上去
Police. We get on this.

101
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,680
我们在那边有加莱提供的武装反应部队

警方呼吁大家帮助

谈什么?
About what?

108
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,480
吉玛・柯万 还有其他事

109
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,840
还有其他事
Among other things?

110
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,120
你认为是我杀了吉玛?
You think I'm the person who killed Gemma?

111
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,600
为什么你的电脑上有她的照片?
Why is her photo on your computer?

112
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,520
我只是记录下来我帮过的人
I keep records of people I help.

113
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,000
像安东尼・沃尔什?
Like Anthony Walsh?

114
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,680
他只是一心要破坏

115

00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,120
我妹妹
My sister.

119

她又从我这溜走了

122

那可不是我说了算

125

再说现在也太早了些

126

干新闻这行可不要计划地过早

127
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,600
你能明白我的意思吗?

128
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,800
我们鄙视这些年轻人

那样对吗? 陶德

我在
I might be.

00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,120
这个社会对年轻人总是不予理睬

让人们都能看到
Where people can see them.

141
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,720
真理杀手把他的第四条真理

143
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,880
斯蒂芬・博蒙特身上
was slipping away on the ferry.

144
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,720
他究竟是谁?
Who was he really?

145
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,910
只是另一个觉得自己
Just another sad guy who thought  

146
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:23,340
能改变世界的伤心人
he could change the world.

147
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,680
那纵火案呢?
And the burning?

148
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,800
真理杀手宣称他的真理叫"当下的年轻人"
TT is calling his truth "The youth of today."

149
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,360
他强调司法体系对现在的年轻人是该正确对待
He's highlighting the way the youth is treated or

150
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
还是虐待
mistreated by the justice system.

151
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,800
他努力想要被认可...
He was trying to get qualified...

152
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,040
想找到工作 想要被表扬...
trying to get a job, trying to get on...

153
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
但是这太难了 所以...
It's just so hard, so...

154
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,200
他说"我爱你 妈妈"然后就离开了
He said "I love you, Mom" and he was out the door.

155
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,600
那是我最后一次见他
That's the last time I saw him.

156
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,440
迪恩・阿特金森 十九岁
Dean Atkinson, 19.

157
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,200
因参与伦敦暴乱坐了两年牢
Did two years for his part in London riot.

158
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,120
不同于我们之前遇到过的任何烧伤
Quite unlike any burns we have come across.

159
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,671
我们偶尔也遇到过大面积扩散的 
We occasionally get them as wide spread, 

160
00:14:17,672 --> 00:14:19,520
但从未像这样被严重腐蚀的
but never this corrosive.

161
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,040
所用的化学燃料
The chemical used,

162
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,160
我们认为应该是白磷
white phosphorus we think

163
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,120
毁掉了他百分之九十的皮肤
has taken off 90% of the skin.

164
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,640
烧伤最严重的部位是这儿还有这儿
The burns are most at their most intense here and here.

165
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,040
应该是有人把它装进了他的口袋里
Could one have been stuffed in his pockets.

166
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,840
他的衣服现在在哪?
Where are his clothes now ?

167
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,900
这就是我为什么说腐蚀的严重
That's what I meant by corrosive.

168
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,840
除了他的鞋和剩下的一部分织物 
Apart from his shoes and the odd strand of fabric, 

169
00:14:38,841 --> 00:14:40,160
他几乎和他来的时候一样
he was nigh this when he came in.

170
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,720
磷是怎么被引燃的?
How did the phosphorus catch fire ?

171
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,000
需要好几分钟时间
Takes a good few minutes,

172
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,680
但是白磷一接触氧气就会变成燃烧得
but white phosphorus combusts on exposure to oxygen

173
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,245
更加猛烈的东西 
becoming something far nastier, 

174
00:14:55,246 --> 00:14:57,280
叫做五氧化二磷
something called phosphorus pentoxide.

175
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
他家人来过了吗?
The family been here ?

176
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,060
他母亲要求过
His mother has been asking.

177
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,160
她不能看到这个
She can't see this.

178
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,320
她有权利
She has the right.

179
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,600
她是有 那我们就要阻止她行使权力
She does, and we have to  prevent her from exercising it.

180
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
又有三起纵火案
Three more burnings

181
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,960
都是男性青年 都是被定过罪的暴乱参与者
all male youths, all convicted roiters.

182
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,340
纵火都在公共场所 受害人都在几秒钟内死亡
All burned in public places  and dead within seconds.

183
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,005
不仅仅是公共场所 
Public places isn't the half of it,  

184
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:33,040
现在都成了电视节目的热点
these are CCTV hotspots.

185
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,360
他要的是最大可见度
He is after maximum visibility.

186
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,080
几乎变成道德信标了
Going up like moral beacons.

187
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,086
还是白磷? 
White phosphorus again? 

188
00:16:39,087 --> 00:16:40,900
前两起是 第三起还在化验中
The first two, the lab is still checking on the 3rd.

189
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,780
为什么不在网上登出来?
Why isn't the web site up ?

190
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,000
你整天都在干什么?
What are you doing all day?

191
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,400
让我瞧瞧...
Here we go...

192
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,080
警察殴打 错误的抓捕
Police beating, wrongfully arrested

193
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,120
错误的判决
Disproportionate sentencing.

194
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,920
这是什么?
What's this?

195
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,560
这些是他为真理做的海报男孩
So these are the poster boys for his campaign.

196
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,000
下一步是什么
What next?

197
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,000
下一步
Next?

198
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,640
他做够了吗
Hasn't he done enough ?

199
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,720
让人去把四个网点的监控录像全部找来
Get uniforms to seize all CCTV footage of all four sites.

200
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,160
检查名单上所有的人
Run checks on all the names on that list.

201
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,920
我们明天要在加莱见面
We should meet in Calais tomorrow.

202
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,241
为什么 他们都是英国人 
Why? They're all British. 

203
00:17:26,242 --> 00:17:27,840
海报男孩是来自两边的人
The poster boys are from both sides of the channel.

204
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,640
为什么要看法国年轻人
Why show French youth 

205
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:30,960
如果你只是想烧死英国人
if you are only going to burn British?

206
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,840
我会叫塞西尔花一个晚上
I'll ask Cicile to spend the night

207
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,540
去调查我们这边的人
researching the ones from our side.

208
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,520
我要去喝一杯
I am off for a drink.

209
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,040
- 我今晚不行 抱歉 - 别害怕 伙计
- I can't tonight mate, sorry. - Don't panic, mate.

210
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,280
我没有邀请你
I am telling you  Not inviting you.

211
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,600
我把最终拷贝发邮件给你
I emailed through the final copy.

212
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,640
这个故事是烧死青年
The story was the burning youths!

213
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,520
不是...每个人都跟着那个
Nah... see everyone's running with that.

214
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,788
我们的故事是
For us the story is 

215
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:07,360
真理杀手怎样试图告诉我们做什么
how TT tried to tell us what to do

216
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,240
以及我们是如何拒绝的
and how we refused.

217
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,160
继续干 好伙计
Keep up, chummy mate.

218
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
你为什么不带爱丽丝
Why didn't you take Elise?

219
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
什么
What?

220
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
你去夏洛特・鲁伯特家的时候
When you went back to Charlotte Joubert's house.

221
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,960
你为什么不带爱丽丝
Why didn't you take Elise?

222
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
因为夏洛特找的是我
Because Charlotte asked for me.

223
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,160
她也找你
And she asked for you.

224
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,120
总之 你自己也看到了
Anyway, you saw yourself,

225
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,440
爱丽丝在人堆里有一点笨手笨脚
Elise can be a bit clumsy around people.

226
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
想清楚
Make up your mind.

227
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,424
是因为夏洛特让你去 
Is it because Charlotte asked you 

228
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:22,220
还是因为爱丽丝在人堆里笨手笨脚
or because Elise can be clumsy around people

229
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,002
或者你这是在给我找借口 
Or are you just throwing excuses my way, 

230
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:24,960
希望我能相信
hoping one will stick.

231
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,000
你跟她上床了吗
Did you sleep with her?

232
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,440
天哪 天哪
God. Oh god.

233
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,600
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant for fuck's sake.

234
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,520
对不起
I'm sorry.

235
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,080
出去
Get out.

236
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,100
有人吗

237
00:21:14,718 --> 00:21:15,734
有人吗

238
00:21:38,156 --> 00:21:41,718
我杀了你弟弟

239
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:17,956
究竟发生了什么

240
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:19,796
你想怎样

241
00:22:32,837 --> 00:22:33,876
谁带你来这儿的

242
00:22:35,116 --> 00:22:36,184
不是你吗

243
00:22:42,956 --> 00:22:44,020
你得帮我

244
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,357
趁他没回来我们快走

245
00:22:48,315 --> 00:22:49,482
是你杀了我弟弟吗

246
00:22:54,504 --> 00:22:57,596
- 你是迈赫迪・谢尔菲的哥哥 - 闭嘴

247
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,357
不要说他的名字

248
00:23:06,374 --> 00:23:07,356
你在干嘛

249
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,799
你这是干嘛

250
00:23:29,197 --> 00:23:30,717
等一下

251
00:23:31,797 --> 00:23:32,827
你想一下

252
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:37,932
听我说

253
00:23:40,478 --> 00:23:42,556
我要你承认杀了我弟弟

254
00:23:45,397 --> 00:23:47,796
一个无辜的孩子 什么也没做

255
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:49,676
只是对关闭他的足球学校表示抗议

256
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:51,158
我要你坦白

257
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:54,010
好吗

258
00:23:55,156 --> 00:23:56,716
是他们引发的暴乱 不是我们

259
00:23:56,876 --> 00:23:57,956
不是我弟弟

260
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:00,537
不是迈赫迪

261
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,356
他当时很害怕

262
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,516
他很害怕 想要逃走 承认吧

263
00:24:09,803 --> 00:24:12,037
他想要从你引发的暴乱中逃走

264
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:13,244
承认吧

265
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:20,317
好吧 你说得对

266
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:23,475
是上面下的指令

267
00:24:23,635 --> 00:24:24,675
别跟我说废话

268
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:28,122
迈赫迪只是在错误的时间出现在了错误的地方

269
00:24:28,277 --> 00:24:29,796
那你为什么要追他

270
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:31,117
他们逼我的

271
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:34,476
他必须成为暴乱的牺牲品

272
00:24:35,512 --> 00:24:36,523
什么

273
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:38,438
他们逼我的 我发誓

274
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,663
你必须要相信我

275
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,195
住手

276
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:56,756
没有人能被逼成为杀人犯

277
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,476
想想你做过的事情

278
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:24,677
我会带着一封坦白信回来

279
00:25:24,837 --> 00:25:26,237
你要在上面签字

280
00:25:31,236 --> 00:25:32,236
如果你不签

281
00:25:33,396 --> 00:25:34,597
如果你拒绝

282
00:25:36,482 --> 00:25:37,596
我会烧死你

283
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:39,956
- 不要 - 要的

284
00:25:40,116 --> 00:25:41,636
我会活活烧死你

285
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,360
混蛋 你在哪儿
Blimey bastard, where are you?

286
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:53,686
当今的年轻人

287
00:27:12,316 --> 00:27:13,315
喂

288
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,720
我是卡尔
It's Karl.

289
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:16,325
谁

290
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,680
聪明的卡尔 运动健将
Sensitive Karl, the sporty intellectual.

291
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,620
你好 我给你买了咖啡 
Bonjour, I got you a cappuccino. 

292
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:36,120
怎么没给亚当带一份
Maybe Adam will have one.

293
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,320
- 亚当 - 我借一下毛巾 行吗
- Adam ? - I borrowed a towel, if that's ok.

294
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,900
发生了什么事?
What is going on?

295
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,280
亚当昨天在这过夜
Adam stayed here last night.

296
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,560
我出去等着好了
I'll be outside.

297
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,000
你最好有正当的理由
This had better be good.

298
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,840
我没必要回答你
I don't have to answer to you.

299
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,260
她是我同事
She is my colleague.

300
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,000
- 所以呢? - 你是我儿子
- And? - You're my son.

301
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,800
我每天都得和她共事 
I have to work with her every day, 

302
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:33,500
你把事情搅得一塌糊涂
makes things just a tiny bit fucking difficult.

303
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,320
为什么不管什么事你都要来插一脚?
Why does it always have to be about you?

304
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
还是你嫉妒我?
Or are you jealous?

305
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,840
嫉妒你什么?
Of what?

306
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,160
还要我直说吗
That's what it is.

307
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,360
归根结底就是尊重二字
It's about respect is what it is.

308
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,800
那你倒是尊重我啊
Start showing some.

309
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,680
- 拜托你成熟一点 - 我一直很成熟
- Oh ! Grow up! - I did.

310
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,060
只是你从来没发现而已
You just never took any notice .

311
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,047
你在干什么?

312
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,116
刚刚做完一些东西

313
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:24,289
什么东西?

314
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:26,956
会让你自豪的东西

315
00:29:28,396 --> 00:29:30,033
没有什么想和我说的吗?

316
00:29:32,242 --> 00:29:33,836
等我做完了会告诉你的

317
00:29:35,972 --> 00:29:37,315
好的 你继续吧

318
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,520
天啊
Oh God.

319
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,000
我迟到了 大事不好
I'm so late, it's not even funny.

320
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,880
厨房里面有咖啡还有一些杂七杂八的
Listen, there's coffee and shit in the kitchen,

321
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,600
你要什么自己拿
just grab whatever.

322
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,520
你什么都不知道
Do you know something.

323
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,800
你甚至都没问过我的名字
You never even asked me my name.

324
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,320
我是故意的
That's intentional.

325
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,340
如果我不知道你的名字 
If I'm never told a name, 

326
00:30:47,341 --> 00:30:48,880
以后你就不会怪我忘了你
I can never be accused of forgetting it.

327
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,840
你不能那样做
You can't do that.

328
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,600
做什么?
Do what?

329
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,671
不管你们两个做了什么 
Whatever it was you were doing together. 

330
00:31:16,672 --> 00:31:17,940
你们到底做了什么?
What was it you were doing together?

331
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,400
算了 不要回答
Don't answer that.

332
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,400
你到底想问什么?
What are you trying to ask me?

333
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,520
你是不是跟我儿子上床了?
Did you have sex with my son?

334
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,080
他成年了
He's 18.

335
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,400
我知道!
I know!

336
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,260
他有隐私权
He's entitled to a private life.

337
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,400
只有没有孩子的人
That's the sort of thing 

338
00:31:35,401 --> 00:31:36,520
才会说这种鬼话
that people who don't have kids say.

339
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,308
他是有权利
He is entitled to try and keep things 

340
00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:40,820
隐瞒父母
from his parents is what he is entitled to do.

341
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,680
但是现在他没能做到
and on this occasion he didn't manage it.

342
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,126
你是不是跟我儿子上床了? 
Did you have sex with my son?? 

343
00:31:44,127 --> 00:31:45,440
那我是不是也有权利...
Am I entitled to.......

344
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,000
回答我的问题
Did you have sex with my son ???

345
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
- 没有 - 好
- No - Good.

346
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,000
谁?
What?

347
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,640
那两个孩子要成为头条新闻了
The youth were meant to be front page

348
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,120
你没有听我说话
but you did not listen

349
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,760
没有 我在听 我只是不知道说什么
No I listened,  I just don't do requests..

350
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,800
出去
Go outside

351
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,360
我想让你看点东西
There is something I want you to see

352
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,080
你从这里怎么去上班?
How would you get to work from here?

353
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,880
- 我开我的赛车去 - 如果你是中产阶级
- I'd take my 4x4. - On an average wage

354
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,600
那怎么办 公车?
I don't know. Bus?

355
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,200
走过去
Walk it

356
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,440
走路
Walk it

357
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,732
P4010 
 "P" 4 "O" 10. 

358
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,460
什么东西? 公车号码还是什么?
What's that ? A bus route or something?

359
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,680
不 这是五氧化二磷
No, it's the correct molecular formula for

360
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,120
正确的分子公式
Phosphorus pentoxide

361
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,480
如果你把这个放在明天报纸的头版
For when you put that on tomorrow's front page

362
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,720
它将会成为爆炸性头条新闻
And it will be the front page

363
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,360
和她谈话很开心
We just had a nice little chat

364
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,120
她叫凯莉
Her name was Kelly.

365
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,380
是一名准记者
She was training to be a journalist.

366
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,440
她需要你的帮助 不过我应该早点告诉她的
She wanted your help. I should have warned her.

367
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,160
丹尼从来不主动发问
Danny doesn't do requests.

368
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,960
天啊
Name of God!

369
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:41,366
我知道这不是我的工作 

370
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:43,314
不过大家对真理杀手都很感兴趣

371
00:33:43,478 --> 00:33:46,164
比如他是谁 接下来打算做什么

372
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:48,373
我在听

373
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:50,758
我看了他放在网上的照片

374
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,935
其中一个人我认识

375
00:33:52,076 --> 00:33:53,196
迈赫迪・谢尔菲

376
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:57,242
他死于抗议学校关闭而发生的一起暴乱

377
00:33:57,397 --> 00:33:58,767
那个杀人凶手

378
00:33:58,882 --> 00:34:00,797
根据在警察巡逻上发布的消息

379
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:03,797
是一名警察 叫劳伦特・德尔加多

380
00:34:05,236 --> 00:34:06,242
劳伦特・德尔加多

381
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,707
他怎么了?

382
00:34:09,837 --> 00:34:13,397
昨晚德尔加多的妻子报警说他失踪了

383
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:15,556
今早我打他的电话 他还没回来

384
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,280
无论如何非常感谢你
Thank you very much. Whatever it was.

385
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,800
他已经换了作案的国家 换了作案的手法
He has changed country, he has changed approach.

386
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,256
也就是说他从被压迫的青少年
Says he's moving from the oppressed youth 

387
00:34:30,257 --> 00:34:31,280
转移到压迫者
to the oppressors?

388
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,840
是的 分析角度不同但是道理是一样的
Yes, the same truth different angle.

389
00:34:34,517 --> 00:34:36,526
我们认为真理杀手已绑架了劳伦特・德尔加多

390
00:34:36,677 --> 00:34:39,036
我需要你手上迈赫迪・谢尔菲的所有资料

391
00:34:39,196 --> 00:34:40,237
他去年死了

392
00:34:40,397 --> 00:34:41,677
然后呢?

393
00:34:41,836 --> 00:34:44,318
你要名单上法国青年的详细资料

394
00:34:44,477 --> 00:34:45,491
对

395
00:34:47,556 --> 00:34:49,598
我以为你的意思是还活着的那些

396
00:34:51,037 --> 00:34:52,116
为什么?

397
00:34:54,128 --> 00:34:55,596
你只要做好本职工作

398
00:34:55,755 --> 00:34:57,239
那些假设都是浪费时间

399
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,160
如果德尔加多在真理杀手手上
If the TT has taken Delgado

400
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,120
为什么他还没有烧死他?
why hasn't he burned him ?

401
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,640
问得好
Good question.

402
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,840
那些闹事的孩子呢?
What about the kids from the riot?

403
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,791
谢尔菲家里在房地产正中心
The Cherfi family has a grocery shop 

404
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:10,720
开了一家杂货店
right in the heart of the estate.

405
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,960
也许我们应该去那看看 那可是块风水宝地
Maybe we should get up there. It's as good a place as any.

406
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,560
怎么了?
What's the matter?

407
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,977
他总是告诉我们他的计划 
He always tells us what he is planning. 

408
00:35:21,978 --> 00:35:23,400
他会打电话 发邮件
He makes calls, posts.

409
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,480
这次怎么没有?
Why not this time?

410
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,720
说不定我们先他一步
Maybe we're one step ahead.

411
00:36:15,996 --> 00:36:17,396
我 劳伦特・德尔加多

412
00:36:17,516 --> 00:36:19,796
承认杀死迈赫迪・谢尔菲...

413
00:36:45,397 --> 00:36:46,841
这是我儿子雅辛

414
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,397
是关于劳伦特・德尔加多失踪的事

415
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:51,553
知道了

416
00:36:51,725 --> 00:36:53,123
你认识劳伦特・德尔加多吗?

417
00:36:53,276 --> 00:36:54,676
我知道他会下地狱的

418
00:36:57,484 --> 00:36:59,681
你知道他在哪吗?

419
00:36:59,836 --> 00:37:01,477
不知道 算他走运

420
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:08,396
请你走近些

421
00:37:10,716 --> 00:37:11,727
过去吧

422
00:37:13,122 --> 00:37:14,133
发生什么事了?

423
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,387
我做了什么吗? 

424
00:37:18,388 --> 00:37:19,996
我们问问题是为了你的安全

425
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,803
他今晚不能外出

426
00:37:22,915 --> 00:37:26,116
凭什么? 我儿子想去哪就去哪

427
00:37:26,283 --> 00:37:28,013
你可以搜我们俩的身 搜这个店 

428
00:37:28,014 --> 00:37:29,283
我们没什么好藏着掖着的

429
00:37:29,437 --> 00:37:30,676
- 行 - 绝对没有

430
00:37:31,356 --> 00:37:32,437
行了 手举起来

431
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,360
有股汽油味
Smells of petrol.

432
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,156
他抽烟吗?

433
00:37:56,756 --> 00:37:57,963
不抽

434
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:24,200
等等 爱丽丝!

435
00:38:24,876 --> 00:38:26,522
他又发布消息了

436
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,687
我马上回来

437
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,440
他把德尔加多交给了那群小孩
He is handing Delgado over to the kids.

438
00:38:49,116 --> 00:38:51,159
领先一步也到此为止了

439
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:55,516
看看我们能从雅辛那知道什么

440
00:38:55,678 --> 00:38:57,436
防暴警察正在接手

441
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:16,277
你为什么带着火柴?

442
00:39:20,515 --> 00:39:21,557
又不犯法

443
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:23,915
有个恐怖分子在活烧人们 

444
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:25,512
还把你弟弟放到了他网站上

445
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:27,362
而你无缘无故地带着火柴

446
00:39:28,396 --> 00:39:29,795
这什么架势? 我被捕了吗?

447
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,437
你在协助调查

448
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:37,903
真的吗?

449
00:39:39,037 --> 00:39:40,118
劳伦特・德尔加多在哪?

450
00:39:42,557 --> 00:39:43,555
我不知道

451
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:44,876
我觉得你知道

452
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:49,716
就算我知道...

453
00:39:54,201 --> 00:39:56,398
- 我凭什么告诉你? - 你满身汽油味

454
00:40:01,157 --> 00:40:02,156
我在车库

455
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:04,918
所以弄得满手都是?

456
00:40:09,316 --> 00:40:10,333
对

457
00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:11,557
听着

458
00:40:11,716 --> 00:40:12,956
迈赫迪他...

459
00:40:13,717 --> 00:40:15,722
- 我们辜负了他 - 你们没辜负他

460
00:40:19,058 --> 00:40:20,476
你们杀害了他

461
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,480
真理杀手手上的
This list.

462
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,840
这个名单
That TT has.

463
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,760
据说列着所有被警方虐待的人
With all those mistreated by the police, allegedly.

464
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,520
- 我们有吗? - 有
- Do we have one? - Yeah.

465
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,970
我们可以向CNDS要一份 
We can request one from CNDS. 

466
00:40:46,971 --> 00:40:48,840
所有指控他们都记录在案
They have all allegations on file.

467
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,960
- 不过那是机密 对吧? - 当然
- It's classified though, right? - Of course.

468
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,880
在英国也是
Yeah, same in UK.

469
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,600
- 所以呢? - 他在炫耀
- So? - He's showing off.

470
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,895
证明只要他想要 
Proving he can get any information he wants 

471
00:40:58,896 --> 00:41:00,540
机密信息也一样能拿到
even if that is classified.

472
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,760
是炫耀还是露了马脚?
Showing off or giving himself away?

473
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,920
他怎么拿到信息的?
How did he get hold of it?

474
00:42:02,441 --> 00:42:03,530
我 劳伦特・德尔加多 

475
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:04,916
承认杀死迈赫迪・谢尔菲...

476
00:43:06,922 --> 00:43:08,244
那家伙临阵脱逃啦?

477
00:43:10,116 --> 00:43:11,797
你口中的那家伙是我儿子

478
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:15,996
我就剩这个孩子了

479
00:43:16,674 --> 00:43:17,695
唯一的一个

480
00:43:18,317 --> 00:43:19,875
他前程似锦

481
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:23,756
他不该为我将做的事面临指控

482
00:43:34,437 --> 00:43:36,156
起来

483
00:43:37,557 --> 00:43:38,632
跪下来

484
00:43:51,648 --> 00:43:53,117
你杀了我的孩子

485
00:43:53,276 --> 00:43:54,288
我的宝贝儿子

486
00:44:13,716 --> 00:44:16,476
给我一个不杀你的理由...

487
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:18,636
一个好理由

488
00:44:22,799 --> 00:44:23,821
我说不出来
