1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,700
Previously on Revolution...

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,070
- Why'd you do it?
- 'Cause we needed him and you asked me to.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,960
- You have to tell me where my son is.
- One thing at a time.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,890
You set off a bomb in my town.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,420
Your job is to keep our
town healthy and compliant,

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,900
unless you're not a loyal American.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,620
You can't fix him. It's the training.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,820
You cut him loose, he will kill us both.

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,040
You were so worried
about trusting my son,

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,780
when you should've been
worried about trusting me.

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,850
You said your husband
was Patriot high command?

12
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,790
- What do you want?
- Where is the old ball and chain?

13
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,930
I'd like to pick your
brain about the nanotech.

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,470
He's already onto the bodies.

15
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,140
Aaron, it's only a matter of
time before Horn is onto you.

16
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,250
So where are they?

17
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,110
I did not want to be right about this.

18
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,260
He's one of them.

19
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,480
We got to get Aaron out of here.

20
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,920
I'm Aaron Pittman! I'll come
quietly! Just leave her alone!

21
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,440
Aaron, you have got to
tell me how you do that.

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,910
You don't have to be afraid of him,

23
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,610
but it's not him
you're afraid of, is it?

24
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,880
Why don't you tell me
what's going on, please?

25
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,150
{\a6}****

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,110
Where's Horn?

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,050
Where's Horn?

28
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,880
I haven't seen the son
of a bitch in a while,

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,420
but I'm pretty sure you
know where he's holed up.

30
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,120
He's working.

31
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,530
Always working.

32
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,160
Working where?

33
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,490
You have no idea who
you're dealing with.

34
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,560
Is that right?

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Horn's looking for you.

36
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,680
He's got men everywhere
looking for you...

37
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,300
and her...

38
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,440
and Pittman.

39
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,440
and once he finds you...

40
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,720
know what he's gonna do?

41
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,090
Of course I do.

42
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,690
That's why I'm gonna find him first.

43
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,870
So let's try this one more time.

44
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,420
Where is he?

45
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,460
I know, I know.

46
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,870
The bombing rocked all of us.

47
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,860
It was a tragedy and an act
of cowardice, plain and simple.

48
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,550
And, folks... We now know
who was behind the bombing...

49
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,930
the man who stood amongst us
and called himself Stu Redman.

50
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,750
But his real name is Miles Matheson.

51
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,750
You may have heard of him...

52
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,940
General Miles Matheson
of the Monroe Republic.

53
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,340
Now, we have reason to believe
he was acting in retaliation

54
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,060
for the execution of his former
leader... Sebastian Monroe,

55
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,610
and he didn't act alone.

56
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,880
He had an accomplice... Aaron Pittman.

57
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,330
Uh, yeah.

58
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:29,200
Matheson and Pittman pulled the
wool over our eyes, yours and mine.

59
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,870
My daughter also came to town with them.

60
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,930
She was troubled psychologically.
Some of you know that.

61
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,270
She had nothing to do with any of this.

62
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,840
She and my granddaughter are victims.

63
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,090
They were manipulated by these men.

64
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,710
So, please, if you see them,
report it to a U.S. officer.

65
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,620
I'm begging you, help me find them.

66
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,290
I just want my family safe.

67
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,020
They said they'd meet us
here, they'll meet us here.

68
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,770
Well, I got news for you, stay puft.

69
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,050
There might have been a change of plan.

70
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,520
What change of plan?

71
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,740
In that this plan has gone to hell.

72
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,120
Those Patriot sons of
bitches were waiting for you.

73
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,590
And we don't know what happened.

74
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,040
We don't know if Miles can even get
out of town or if he's still alive.

75
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,050
We're gonna wait right
here like Miles told us to.

76
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,530
Whoa, okay, okay. Just don't
light me on fire or anything.

77
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,740
Who's that?

78
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,240
Nobody. Just some intel.

79
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,890
What's it like out there?

80
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,120
It's not good.

81
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,820
Truman told everyone
who Miles really is.

82
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,360
Said that Miles is the one that blew up
the building and that he's the terrorist.

83
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
Did you see your grandfather?

84
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,610
Charlie?

85
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,130
Yeah.

86
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,160
Look, mom, we got to find
a way out of town now.

87
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,070
- Not yet.
- Why not? Aaron's waiting for us.

88
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,200
This is for Aaron, trust me.

89
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,310
They will never give up.

90
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,820
They will never stop looking for
him unless we kill Horn first.

91
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,110
They're calling us terrorists.

92
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,350
Just you wait.

93

Hold it right there.

98
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,700
Tom Neville from the Savannah camp.

99
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,410
I'm here to see
commander Roger Allenford.

100
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,900
State your business.

101
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,550
Just... give him this.

102
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,970
Tell him...

103
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,130
I only speak to him.

104
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,660
Those real?

105
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,820
A little privacy, gentlemen.

106
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,970
Is she alive?

107
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,400
Yes, sir.

108
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,430
She is.

109
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,780
Where is she?

110
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,510
Tied up... safe, hidden.

111
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,320
You've got a lot of balls
coming into my office

112
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,540
and telling me you've
got my wife captive.

113
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,180
With all due respect, sir,

114
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,030
your wife is an enemy of
the United States of America.

115
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,420
I figured that you were a good Patriot.

116
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,040
Am I wrong?

117
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,020
She's guilty of sedition.

118
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,040
She should be punished.

119
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,700
So why not bring her in?

120
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,210
My guess is that you have

121
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,110
a dark and stormy cloud over your head,

122
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,780
over an otherwise spotless career.

123
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,760
I mean, your wife is a traitor.

124
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,630
People have to be whispering

125
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,620
whether or not you were pillow-talking,

126
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,410
whether or not any of
it rubbed off on you.

127
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,500
But if you brought your
wife in by yourself,

128
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,670
delivered her unto justice,

129
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,200
that would solve all of
your problems, wouldn't it?

130
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,470
Turn that rain into sunshine.

131
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,170
And why would you do this for me?

132
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,910
Honestly? I'm ambitious.

133
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,060
And I think there's value

134
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,430
in being friends with a man like you.

135
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,330
So, Commander...

136
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,030
would you like to come
and see the missus?

137
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,700
{\a6}****

138
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,380
I thought these people trusted you.

139
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,540
I thought you were
their beloved Dr. Porter.

140
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,530
Someone will know where
Pittman is... I'll find him.

141
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,820
Do you know what'll happen
to your daughter if you don't?

142
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,600
Or your granddaughter?

143
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,410
Threatening me won't
find him any faster.

144
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,290
Someone knows something.

145
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,380
How about we get everyone Pittman knows,

146
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,100
march them into town square,
and start executing them?

147
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,100
I bet they'll talk then.

148
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,810
I have put a hell of a lot of
time into managing this town.

149
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,220
- We have a plan.
- Right, the plan...

150
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,700
taking town after town.

151
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,480
And how many years until
you take the whole continent?

152
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,320
If I get my hands on Pittman and
figure out what makes him tick,

153
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,510
we take everything in months.

154
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,090
That's all.

155
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,240
Here, I found this.

156
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,310
What is that?

157
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,080
What is this, food?

158
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,470
People used to think so, yeah.

159
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,030
I know you're angry,

160
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,020
and I'm not apologizing for him.

161
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,360
But you don't know why
grandpa did what he did.

162
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,050
He sold us out. He works for them.

163
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,370
Yeah, I get it. You hate him for it.

164
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,090
You don't?

165
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,180
No.

166
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,220
Well, you're a better person than me.

167
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,700
No, I'm not.

168
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,440
I hated you for a long time

169
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,020
for abandoning Danny and me...

170
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,730
for killing Nora.

171
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,050
That's not fair.

172
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,050
This is different.

173
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,930
All I'm saying is hating
you was the easy part.

174
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,930
But letting it go?

175
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,770
That's hard.

176
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,080
It's like EPCOT East Berlin out there.

177
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,750
They have dogs.

178
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,640
When the hell did they get dogs?

179
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,350
You find the place?

180
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,800
The guy's intel was legit.

181
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,140
Basement of the old paper factory.

182
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,590
Definitely their H.Q.

183
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,500
Is there any way to get in
there, drop some kind of device?

184
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,120
Not gonna be easy.

185
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,470
Place is sealed up tighter than a drum.

186
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,770
And, uh, Rachel, the...

187
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,050
there's something else.
I... I saw Truman walking in.

188
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,160
Good. Two birds, one stone.

189
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,830
Walking in with Gene.

190
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,150
You should try to sleep.

191
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,740
You haven't said a
word all day. Come on...

192
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,950
talk to me.

193
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,240
Did you kill Carl?

194
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,340
What?

195
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,700
Did you kill my husband?

196
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,390
The way he died,

197
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,960
the fire in the car,

198
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,650
it was always strange.

199
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,430
- He hit me.
- Oh, my...

200
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,500
oh, God.

201
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,080
Oh, God, Aaron.

202
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,550
I got angry, and I couldn't control it.

203
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,990
You know I can't control it.

204
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,680
You lied to me.

205
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,280
You murdered him, and
you slept in my bed...

206
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,330
and you lied about it.

207
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,190
I'm sorry.

208
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,830
I didn't know how to explain it.

209
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,910
I've had enough liars in my life.

210
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,450
- Cynthia...
- Just leave me alone.

211
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,900
I need to think.

212
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,230
What?

213
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,680
I always dreamed of
cooking with my daughter,

214
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,680
just not like this.

215
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,300
You sure this stuff is safe to carry?

216
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,390
Separately they're fine.

217
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:18,570
But drop this with this down an
air shaft into a locked up basement?

218
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,220
The gas will kill Horn
and everyone else inside.

219
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,740
So when the time comes to do this,

220
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,130
what if grandpa's there?

221
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,670
Let's just hope that he's not.

222
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,180
Okay, but if he is,

223
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,400
you're not gonna go
through with it, right?

224
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,740
Mom?

225
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,070
Hey.

226
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,640
Where the hell are you going?

227
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,130
You're just gonna leave us?

228
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,000
Look, if Miles was coming,
he would've been here by now.

229
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,720
I'm gonna go find him.

230
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,260
And what if they find us?

231
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,240
All right, just...
just hold on, hold on.

232
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,150
We wouldn't last three days without you.

233
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,710
You think three?

234
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,780
Look, Miles has got some information
that I need, someone I need to find.

235
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,830
I held up my end of the bargain.

236
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,830
Now it's his turn...

237
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,830
that's if he's even alive.

238
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,080
You they won't kill.

239
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,460
Me on the other hand...

240
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,600
What?

241
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,960
- What the hell are you doing?
- Aaron!

242
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,970
- Aaron, help!
- Cynthia!

243
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,380
Help!

244
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,910
Aaron!

245
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,100
Help!

246
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,710
Aaron!

247
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,400
{\a6}****

248
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,550
Dad.

249
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,830
- I will fear no evil for thou art with me.
- Dad...

250
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,520
She's not getting any better.

251
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,770
She will.

252
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,750
God won't take her from me.

253
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,550
What if there's something
more that we could do for her?

254
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,130
I'm praying as hard as I know how.

255
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,610
Gary's father is a doctor.

256
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,110
Maybe he could come and see her.

257
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,200
- He... he could...
- He could what?\

258
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,090
We cannot control the lord's will.

259
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,720
Now, you know that.

260
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,640
Now come pray with me, boy.

261
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,500
The lord is my Shepherd.

262
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,140
I shall not want.

263
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,140
We know that through you...

264
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,940
Oh, no.

265
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,670
She can't.

266
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,300
It's her decision to make.

267
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,870
Dr. Porter, what are you doing here?

268
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,070
We have the doctor to
thank for finding you.

269
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,810
Searching the boatyard was his idea.

270
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,670
Gene?

271
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:21,490
Horn, let her go. Please...

272
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,460
she's... she's got nothing
to do with it. Please.

273
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,250
I'm sorry. I need insurance, Aaron.

274
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,650
Can't have one of your
pyrotechnic displays.

275
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,380
As long as you
cooperate, she'll be fine.

276
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,900
You son of a bitch.

277
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,140
Let her go. Let her go.

278
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,410
Cynthia, I'm sorry.

279
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,440
I'm sorry.

280
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,020
Aaron's inside.

281
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,480
{\a6}****

282
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,530
Dad?

283
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,530
What have you done, Calvin?

284
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,880
Gary's father gave them to me.

285
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,340
I didn't want her to die.

286
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,650
Well, she died because of you.

287
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,670
You prayed for a miracle.

288
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,760
But there are no miracles.

289
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,900
Please, do anything you want to me.

290
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,210
Just please let her go.

291
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,950
There.

292
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,770
That should keep you nice and relaxed.

293
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,690
They tell me you came back
from the dead, Aaron...

294
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,300
2 1/2 hours without a heartbeat.

295
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,240
That would make you a
modern-day Lazarus, wouldn't it?

296
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,380
That is, if you believed
in that sort of thing.

297
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:50,450
So what say we start by seeing
how resilient your body really is.

298
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,660
You're free to go, doctor.

299
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,350
I'm staying.

300
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:00,620
If you're going to hurt him,
I want to be here to help him.

301
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,430
How do we know pain isn't
an important part of it?

302
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,080
No, you did your part
bringing him here. Thank you.

303
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,070
And as promised,

304
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,060
as long as your daughter doesn't
look for any more trouble,

305
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,010
I won't go looking for her.

306
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,850
Now, doctor.

307
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:54,770
{\a6}****

308
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,070
Jason, please. Please...

309
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,230
just let me go.

310
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,380
Why are you doing this?

311
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,230
Is it because your father's
telling you to? Huh?

312
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,860
Shut up.

313
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,610
You always follow the man's orders?

314
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,430
I said shut up.

315
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:35,200
He let you get shipped off
to that reeducation center.

316
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,400
He didn't try to stop
it. He didn't say a word.

317
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,490
You know, he doesn't give a
damn about you, and you just...

318
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,800
Jason...

319
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:09,750
you're not fully deprogrammed, are you?

320
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,550
Not completely...

321
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,050
not all the way.

322
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,800
How much further?

323
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,090
Just up ahead.

324
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,780
Do we have a problem?

325
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,830
Did you hurt her?

326
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,300
I wondered if something
like this might happen.

327
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,540
You're still sweet on the woman.

328
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,230
Well, first thing you need
to know, I have a man on her.

329
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,440
You try walking in there without
me, it'll be a short reunion.

330
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,080
So how about we put the gun down?

331
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,210
No, this is what's gonna happen.

332
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,130
You're gonna take me in there,
and you're gonna let my wife go.

333
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,330
And then? What?

334
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:07,730
You two run off together, escape
like two star-crossed teens?

335
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,620
Boy, she must be worth it.

336
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,030
She must give it to you good and sweet.

337
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,700
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?

338
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,890
I thought I was talking to a
man with his head on straight.

339
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,380
If I bring her back...

340
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,710
- they'll kill her.
- You cut her loose and run off,

341
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,140
they'll hunt you down and kill you both.

342
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,460
How far do you think
you're gonna make it

343
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,760
with your soft hands and your fine art?

344
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,090
Be realistic.

345
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:42,010
Your wife went rogue
without a single thought

346
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,640
of what it might do to you or your son.

347
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,210
And if the boy has two traitor parents,

348
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,570
what do you think
they're gonna do to him?

349
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,750
The only question is,

350
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,880
what side of this are you gonna land on?

351
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,770
Charlie?

352
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,140
What the hell are you
still doing in town?

353
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,850
- You should be miles from here.
- We can't.

354
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,940
Aaron's our family.

355
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,700
How'd they find him, Gene?

356
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,050
I found him.

357
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,180
And what's Horn doing with him?

358
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,610
I don't know.

359
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,010
He's still alive... for now.

360
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,730
Grandpa, how could you?

361
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,750
They were gonna kill you if I didn't.

362
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,800
What else was I supposed to do?

363
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,640
How about the right thing?

364
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:15,120
How about everything that you taught me?

365
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,920
Okay. We're gonna get
Aaron out of there,

366
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,060
and you are gonna help.

367
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,930
There's nothing I can do.

368
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,880
You can't get in. It's too late.

369
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,960
- And whose fault is that?
- I was trying to keep you safe.

370
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,340
Really?

371
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,860
By lying to me?

372
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,880
By letting me think that I was crazy?

373
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,290
How was that supposed to help?

374
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,360
Your mother...

375
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,590
died of an awful disease.

376
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:56,630
There was nothing I could do
except watch her waste away.

377
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,590
And suddenly...

378
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,500
I had a chance to save everybody.

379
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,970
They gave me medicine.

380
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,000
No one else had to die like she did.

381
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:20,820
I didn't realize who they
were until it was too late.

382
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,800
But, Rachel...

383
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,430
it's too late.

384
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,930
You rolled over.

385
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,600
You helped them.

386
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,780
You've never done a bad
thing for a good reason?

387
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,700
What about you, Miles?

388
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,440
Dad...

389
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:55,200
how am I ever supposed
to forgive you for this?

390
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,670
You're not.

391
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,400
I don't want it.

392
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,030
If keeping you alive...

393
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,240
means you hate me,
then you just hate me.

394
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,610
But for God's sake, run.

395
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,540
Run.

396
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,520
I know you all are in there!

397
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,040
You got one minute to surrender
yourselves and come on out,

398
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,650
or we're coming in.

399
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,700
Get them out, Gene, or
else this ends bloody.

400
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,310
- You son of a bitch.
- I didn't know, I swear.

401
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:36,440
Look... I can...

402
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,130
let me stay behind.

403
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,010
Maybe I can buy you a couple of minutes.

404
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,640
Please.

405
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,640
No.

406
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,310
You have to come with us.

407
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,310
He's coming with us.

408
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,460
Prepare to fire.

409
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,990
What is this, Gene?

410
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,460
Where are they?

411
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,370
Horn said he was gonna
leave my daughter alone.

412
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,110
And he will.

413
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,410
But Miles Matheson
bombed the town, remember?

414
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,790
Now, you hand him over,

415
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,730
and your daughter walks free.

416
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:41,840
I heard that one before, Ed.

417
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,360
It's the truth.

418
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:52,600
Any one of you takes a step forward
toward that building, this man dies.

419
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,700
Big mistake here, Gene.

420
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,700
I've made worse.

421
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,490
Go, damn it!

422
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,460
Unbelievable.

423
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,310
Why you, Aaron?

424
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:42,600
The nanites in your body
are behaving in a highly

425
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,460
individual way, repairing your cells,

426
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,930
oxygenating your blood.

427
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,930
But why?

428
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,530
Why only you?

429
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,670
I have no idea.

430
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,200
You think of me as your enemy.

431
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,170
But we're partners now.

432
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,720
You know, my father believed there was

433
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,800
a magic, invisible power all around us,

434
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,070
and if he prayed hard enough,

435
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,010
it would grant him a miracle.

436
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,250
He was a horrible, stupid man

437
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,560
who based his whole
life on a fairy tale.

438
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,890
But it's ironic.

439
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,330
Turns out he was right...

440
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,330
sort of.

441
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,250
There is an invisible
power that can save people.

442
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,720
It just doesn't come
from heaven, that's all.

443
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,650
But I have to admit,

444
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,540
it is, in its own way,

445
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,720
a miracle.

446
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,370
You're gonna teach me how to use it.

447
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,710
I can't.

448
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,110
I don't know how.

449
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,740
Then we'll figure it out together.

450
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,900
It's important.

451
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,660
I have a tumor growing in my brain,

452
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,350
and the symptoms are getting worse.

453
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,560
And I'd lost all hope.

454
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,560
Then I heard about you.

455
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,130
Aaron...

456
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,890
I need you to deliver me that miracle.

457
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,100
And I believe that you can.

458
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,020
Jason!

459
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,490
Easy, boy.

460
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,810
Everything's under control.

461
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,540
Roger.

462
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,230
Justine.

463
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,190
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

464
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,430
Writing that letter...

465
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,050
was stupid.

466
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,280
You knew how they would react.

467
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:50,410
What they did to Max, to our baby boy...

468
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,460
I didn't want them to
do that to anyone else.

469
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,140
You know how much
trouble you're in now...

470
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:04,480
how much trouble we're
both in because of you?

471
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,040
I'm sorry.

472
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,450
You got to stay clearheaded about this.

473
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:15,360
Roger, this is a dangerous man.

474
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,420
You can kill them both, and we can run.

475
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,670
Where?

476
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,050
Huh? Where? Where can we go?

477
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,860
Got to be realistic.

478
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,950
Roger... I love you.

479
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,550
I love you too.

480
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,350
Roger, no!

481
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,490
So how are we gonna get Aaron now?

482
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,080
And dad.

483
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,040
Yeah, that's right.

484
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,390
We're gonna go get your grandfather.

485
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,650
If either of you have any bright
ideas, I'd love to hear them.

486
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,230
So here's what we've learned.

487
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:42,640
Self-healing occurs as a direct
reaction to physical trauma,

488
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,530
like a lizard regrowing its tail...

489
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:48,160
but your defensive actions,

490
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,480
burning people alive and all that,

491
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,120
are a response to emotional stimuli.

492
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,210
That's what the next phase is all about.

493
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,220
Here you go.

494
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,930
This one should perk you right up.

495
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,380
Aaron!

496
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,810
What are you gonna do?

497
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:30,200
Sorry. I am,

498
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:34,230
but we need to elevate you
to a proper emotional state.

499
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,230
Then maybe...

500
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,370
maybe you can heal someone else.

501
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,560
No. Please!

502
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,380
You said you weren't gonna hurt her.

503
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,380
I'll check in in a bit.

504
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,930
This room may not be the
safest place to be right now.

505
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,380
Stop!

506
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,200
No!

507
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,050
