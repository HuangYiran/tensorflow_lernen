1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,480
<i>Ed Bader's up for reelection.</i>

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,020
You know how he got to be mayor?

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,390
You wanted him to be.

4
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,060
You're going to work at his office.

5
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,680
All I require is that you keep your eyes and ears open.

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,180
I spoke to Rothstein.

7
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,650
Masseria squeezed him out of the heroin business.

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,660
I should like to meet with Mr. Masseria.

9
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,270
<i>Petrucelli's the biggest importer of heroin</i>
<i>in the whole southeast.</i>

10
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,670
Go back to Tampa.

11
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,140
Those trucks he send up here with the rum...

12
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,440
maybe they carry something for us, too.

13
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,070
- Say hello to Abe Redstone.
- Pleasure to make--

14
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,770
I will thank you in advance
for your discretion.

15
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,720
<i>I'm assuming a reciprocal arrangement would be to your advantage?</i>

16
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,870
- It would.
- Then until next time.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,400
Mr. White is alive,

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,490
and you have crushed me.

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,770
Let me see you, girl.

20
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,760
Stand up.
Stand your ass up!

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,070
Think about what comes out of your mouth next

22
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,600
unless you are ready for a war that you will fight alone.

23
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,280
We're agents of the Bureau of Investigation.

24
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,510
Bring us your brother along with the criminals he conspires with.

25
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,450
<i>And your son stays a free man.</i>

26
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,780
<i>and you get to hold on to what matters.</i>

30
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,330
I don't know exactly his position, but he's bigtime over there.

31
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,940
<i>- This is Balanchuk?</i> 
- Yeah.

32
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,930
And you've dealt with him directly in Atlantic City?

33
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,660
Once or twice when he was Torrio's runner. I don't know.

34
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,810
You don't know?

35
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,160
Not since he got bumped up.

36
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,530
Joseph Balanchuk. What is that, Polish?

37
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,110
- It's Ukrainian. 
- I thought Torrio only worked with Italians.

38
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,010
- Does he? 
- It's a syndicate, for Christ's sake.

39
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,150
- Consisting of? 
- <i>Italians, sure.</i>

40
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,020
All kinds of greaseballs.

41
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,680
Jews.

42
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,580
He's got this one, Jake Guzik, runs his breweries.

43
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,900
But this Balanchuk, he's high up the ladder?

44
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,910
Very high.

45
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,740
He's like Torrio's second.

46
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,210
- Bring it up here, will you? 
- Right, boss.

47
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,090
- Hungry? 
- My dad was a sea dog.

48
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,740
Tattoo of a mermaid on his forearm.

49
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,010
See the world.

50
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,320
I bet that sounds pretty good to you right now.

51
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,550
<i>I know this is difficult.</i>

52
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,000
But what you're doing takes courage.

53
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,520
You're a good father.

54
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,130
Tampa

55
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,530
Get that. Come on. Let's get that unloaded.

56
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,410
Let's go.

57
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,160
<i>They ain't gonna move themselves.</i>

58
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,110
<i>Come on, let's just give me a hand over here.</i>

59
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,980
<i>Give me another barrel of them oranges here.</i>

60
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,760
- Go. We're done. 
- All right.

61
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,840
- Almost there. 
- How many more crates left?

62
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,780
- Just a few. 
- You still here?

63
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,780
Ain't a mirage, lady.

64
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,400
Those trucks got to be on the road in half an hour, McCoy.

65
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,050
I'm at sea for three weeks. Just catching up with the boys.

66
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,700
That sort of look like a woman.

67
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,550
In the right light, I suppose.

68
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,270
How would you pole jockeys know what a woman looks like?

69
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,090
Last call's over. Move your asses.

70
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,270
You two still got them full boxes here to load.

71
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,150
Let's go. Come on, get 'em out.

72
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,330
<i>He'd sweat his balls off in there.</i>

73
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,970
Should make Joe happy.

74
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,490
Tell him to come down next time.

75
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,680
Let's move it along. I'm on a schedule, fellas.

76
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,140
Keep an eye on these <i>finocchi.</i>

77
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,750
Caught one of them trying to steal some of our hooch.

78
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,590
<i>You were supposed to call me three hours ago.</i>

79
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,280
- <i>You miss me? 
- Aw, shucks.</i>

80
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,450
This is business, which runs on a schedule.

81
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,720
You call me just to say hello.

82
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,330
<i>Is that what this is?</i>

83
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,340
No. Something's wrong.

84
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,690
<i>Nuck, I'm hanging up now.</i>

85
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,470
What is it?

86
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,110
<i>I said I'm hanging up.</i> I wasn't talking to you!

87
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,720
<i>So what's the problem?</i> <i>Tell me.</i>

88
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,400
<i>That wop you're in bed with, Petrucelli--</i>

89
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,890
- <i>he's pulling a fast one.</i> 
- How so?

90
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,280
<i>Turns out, rum ain't the only thing you're running.</i>

91
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,110
Him and the other ones, Luciano and his partner--

92
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,390
Lansky.

93
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,170
- Who's there? 
- <i>McCoy.</i>

94
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,490
He's with me. Anyway...

95
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,930
turns out they're stashing heroin in with your hooch

96
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,270
<i>and trucking it north.</i>

97
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,200
And you know this how?

98
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,430
A girl has her ways.

99
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,260
You tell anyone besides McCoy?

100
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,430
<i>I prefer to live near the swamp, not in it.</i>

101
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,440
- Well, keep him close by. 
- Do I have to?

102
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,520
<i>Yes.</i>

103
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,890
And, Sally, I owe you one.

104
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,010
<i>And don't think I don't know it, sport.</i>

105
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,410
From our wedding.

106
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,660
<i>- Said how he's too old.</i> 
<i>- Aw.</i>

107
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,350
What are you doing here?

108
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,900
I like to know what my clients are insuring.

109
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,420
- Keeps me inspired. 
- I understand you've bought a policy.

110
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,580
<i>Whole life.</i>

111
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,410
When it matures, you'll be sitting on a nice little nest egg.

112
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,980
Let's hope it doesn't hatch.

113
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,720
Quite a boy you've got here.

114
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,740
<i>Left college to take a position with the mayor's office?</i>

115
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,410
That's what I call gumption.

116
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,620
- What is it you want exactly, Mr.-- 
- Balanchuk.

117
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,620
I recently transferred from the Chicago office.

118
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,190
Mr. Balanchuk.

119
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,960
I just need to go over a few documents and I'll be out of your hair.

120
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,670
We'll move into the kitchen, give you some privacy.

121
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,180
You should thank your father.

122
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,990
<i>He knows that in an instant,</i>

123
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,080
tragedy can strike and everything a man's worked for,

124
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,130
<i>everything he loves,</i> <i>everything he holds dear...</i>

125
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,530
...can be gone.

126
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,280
- Get to work now, huh? 
- Yes, sir.

127
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,410
You come to my fuckin' house?

128
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,010
Joseph Balanchuk has been dead for two years.

129
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,690
John Torrio paid for his funeral.

130
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,280
- They don't update me on turnover. 
- Playing me for a chump?

131
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,290
You asked what I know. That's what I know.

132
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,020
Next time, know better.

133
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,250
Or as God is my judge, that bright-eyed young son of yours

134
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,360
will be breaking rocks up at Trenton.

135
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,590
- Everything okay? Yeah. 
- Just a spill.

136
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,770
That was some good coffee. Thank you.

137
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,410
Price still hasn't come in yet.

138
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,060
New York City

139
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,290
Yes, please hold for Mrs. Rohan.

140
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,600
Hello? Yes, this is she.

141
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,930
I'm calling in regard to your advertisement in the "Herald."

142
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,050
The apartments in Inwood.

143
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,470
No, I am unmarried.

144
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,540
Recently widowed, actually.

145
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,770
Isham Garden Apartments
2 room, 500

146
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,710
A personal tour would be grand.

147
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,250
And in terms of rent, is that--

148
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,760
I-- I'm sorry. I'll have to call you back.

149
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,500
Changing your residence?

150
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,570
I-- just considering my options.

151
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,010
Mr. Bennett is still at lunch.

152
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,640
May I get you something, Mr. Redstone?

153
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,990
- Have you any milk? 
- Certainly.

154
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,750
May I inquire as to your salary, Mrs. Rohan?

155
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,120
$11 per week.

156
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,430
With the occasional bonus for good performance.

157
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,860
That's $572 annually

158
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,680
with a prospective yearly rental of over half that.

159
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,210
I imagine you're frugal,

160
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,800
but subtracting for the grocer,

161
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,330
transportation, clothing, sundries and what have you,

162
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,230
it seems these particular quarters are above your means.

163
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,260
I fail to see what business this is of yours.

164
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,620
May I offer you some free advice?

165
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,700
Is there anything more expensive in the world?

166
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,940
Forget this place and call me.

167
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,180
I own several buildings uptown.

168
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,800
Perhaps I could steer you

169
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,080
to more suitable accommodations.

170
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,610
CIrcle 6-4408

171
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,120
In exchange for what?

172
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,670
Your boss, Mr. Bennett,

173
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,140
he and his ilk are systematically driving down

174
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,460
<i>the price of Anaconda Realty stock,</i>

175
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,670
<i>in which I'm invested.</i>

176
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,010
Soon, no doubt, they plan on buying it back.

177
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,060
I need to know when this happens.

178
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,550
- I could lose my job. 
- Yes, you could.

179
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,190
Or perhaps gain something better.

180
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,600
Come on, Abe, quit flirting.

181
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,790
Hello, Robert.

182
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,020
Nice chatting with you, Mrs. Rohan.

183
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,100
<i>Got something special coming in.</i>

184
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,660
<i>You're the first person I thought of.</i>

185
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,640
He show his face around here,

186
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,550
him or one of his boys, you get word to me right quick.

187
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,710
Ain't seen a hair of the doctor since the other night.

188
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,830
Ain't heard his speechifying neither.

189
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,370
His jabbering days be over soon enough.

190
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,730
Tonight we pay a visit down the Northside

191
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,320
and see how he--

192
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,890
Back in the kitchen, ofay. This here private.

193
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,750
So this here the new dishwasher Nucky hire?

194
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,280
Half-face white boy taking our jobs.

195
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,520
Well, the way I see it,

196
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,600
one man got as much right to eat as another.

197
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,100
And this here man a friend of mine.

198
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,170
Mr. Harrow.

199
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,280
Mr. White.

200
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,780
You need something, you look me up.

201
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,950
Tonight, over at UNIA.

202
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,230
We wait till after dark.

203
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,430
Ain't nobody gonna be there but Narcisse and his men.

204
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,210
So he's running, being chased

205
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,270
through these giant flowerpots,

206
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,930
and he's jumping and bouncing in and out

207
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,050
like he's got springs in his shoes.

208
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,150
What? Who was?

209
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,240
Douglas Fairbanks. Ain't you listening?

210
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,630
Hey, Nuck,

211
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,260
you see "The Thief of Bagdad"?

212
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,700
You've got time to go to the pictures?

213
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,430
No.

214
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,390
Just, you know.

215
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,670
I need you to take some men, head out to the White Horse Pike.

216
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,740
What's out there?

217
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,640
A convoy of trucks heading from Tampa to New York.

218
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,780
- You want me to stop it? 
- Yes.

219
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,430
And find the heroin Petrucelli's piggybacking with our rum.

220
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,680
Petrucelli's in business with Masseria?

221
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,280
Masseria, Luciano, Lansky.

222
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,610
- Jesus. 
- This kid, this fucking Luciano.

223
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,720
Should have let me plug him years ago when I had the chance.

224
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,730
First, let's make sure it's true.

225
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,610
- Bring Knox and a couple of his men. 
- Flash some tin, less likely to get messy.

226
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,610
Just get it done.

227
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,840
<i>You take everything north of 22nd.</i>

228
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,800
That's 84 speaks in total.

229
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,650
Up to or including Madison?

230
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,980
Include it.

231
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,620
Let Hymie Weiss try and tell you otherwise.

232
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,280
Johnny, hey. Thought you'd gone already.

233
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,320
- Who's this? 
- George.

234
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,110
From the flower shop. I told you about him, didn't I?

235
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,090
No.

236
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,610
Sir, he helped us arrange O'Banion's retirement party.

237
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,000
No, that was a disgruntled customer. Half a fin for a dozen roses--

238
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,600
you get 'em home, they're already wilting. Drive any fella to murder.

239
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,940
- George here's gonna be taking over my collections. 
- Yeah, I'm moving Ralphie up.

240
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,610
Oh, you are?

241
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,180
So's I can run the distribution more hands-on.

242
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,090
And what'll I be doing?

243
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,200
Come again?

244
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,280
While your hands are on the distribution, what will I be doing?

245
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,750
Whatever you want. I mean, I ain't gonna squeeze you out or nothing.

246
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,910
You wouldn't squeeze me out of my own operation?

247
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,680
- That is very generous of you. 
- You know what I mean.

248
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,260
I mean, I know you like to relax.

249
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,210
I got people coming up behind me.

250
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,030
They're, what do you call it, ambitious.

251
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:24,020
- I've been meaning to talk to you about this anyway. 
- So talk.

252
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,350
We had discussions, you and me, about the future

253
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,940
when you got back from Italy.

254
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,220
Expanding my role when you retire.

255
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,120
But I ain't retiring, Al.

256
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,730
No. Right.

257
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,450
Of course.

258
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,710
I know that.

259
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,490
Someday. Eventually.

260
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,570
I'm gonna go. It's good you're thinking ahead.

261
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,390
I remind you all once again that our other business must be kept far away--

262
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,510
Doctor.

263
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,980
Watch out!

264
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,480
<i>Get down! Get down!</i>

265
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,930
Come on, let's go.

266
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,230
Chalky--

267
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,000
Go! Go!

268
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,140
C. Auguste Dupin.

269
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,620
I don't know him.

270
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,180
He's fictional. A detective.

271
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,260
"The Murders in the Rue Morgue."

272
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,350
Right.

273
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,950
Those stories are the reason I wanted to join law enforcement.

274
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,310
You've handled yourself well.

275
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,640
I'm sure you were a good cop.

276
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,380
Are we friends now?

277
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,610
Dinner bell.

278
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,950
You don't have to be my pal, Eli.

279
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,420
I mean, heck, I don't even think you like me.

280
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,920
But really, this doesn't have to be so bad.

281
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,940
Okay, fellas.

282
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,270
- Fan it out. Let's go. 
- All right.

283
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,380
Hold up.

284
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,500
<i>Stay where you are, sir.</i>

285
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,430
Eli, what the fuck is this?

286
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,910
<i>- Search the trucks.</i> 
<i>- Move!</i>

287
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,150
Since when did you start riding with the help?

288
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,160
You want to tell me what's transpiring here? We're already behind.

289
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,930
- It's none of your business what we got in there. 
- Is there a problem, Agent Selby?

290
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,120
This wise head won't get out of the way.

291
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,820
Perhaps you're using the wrong approach.

292
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,180
Step aside, please. Tell it to Joe the boss.

293
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,420
Why don't you relay the message instead?

294
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,180
Any other objections?

295
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,490
- <i>No, sir. No, sir.</i> 
- All right, all right. All right.

296
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,890
Open up. Open up.

297
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,220
Was that necessary?

298
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,090
You heard the man. They're already behind.

299
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,830
Take your time, by all means.

300
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,620
And before this gets any further out of hand, please tell me how I can be of assistance.

301
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,220
We understand you're carrying more than rum.

302
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,820
If we are, that's beyond any personal knowledge I have of the situation.

303
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,620
Dr. Narcisse.

304
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,270
- Chalky White. 
- <i>I told him he wasn't here, boss.</i>

305
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,200
You don't tell Dr. Narcisse anything.

306
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,490
He's not.

307
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,840
Now you've heard it from me, so...

308
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,210
He came at me. I want him dead.

309
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,110
- Came at you how? 
- <i>With a pistol.</i>

310
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,060
He and his men killed three of mine.

311
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,580
- This happened tonight? 
- <i>And tonight it ends.</i>

312
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,930
What you yourself began.

313
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,940
Dead!

314
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,100
I will cut him from nave to chaps.

315
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,070
You'll find the meat tough, Doctor.

316
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,610
Tell me where he is or don't.

317
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,000
Your choice.

318
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,260
Dr. Narcisse,

319
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,050
there's something I've been meaning to ask you

320
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,140
for quite some time.

321
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,520
Who the fuck do you think you are?

322
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,210
Cast your lot? Is it so?

323
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:49,980
Your leaving on your feet or on your back is entirely up to you.

324
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,710
So don't make a mistake.

325
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,930
- You ready for this? 
- Just say.

326
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,360
I'll put one in this burrhead right now.

327
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,370
Mr. Thompson, he not ready for this.

328
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,500
Don't be so sure.

329
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,420
I told you, I don't know where Chalky is.

330
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,980
You've got problems with him, take it up with him.

331
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,780
Now get the fuck out of my club.

332
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:24,420
When I run him through, watch the light go out,

333
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,360
I hope he knows what a friend he had in you.

334
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,580
You sure this copacetic?

335
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,420
- I ain't never fought no war but my own. 
- They're painting the Legion hall.

336
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,600
You'll be safe here through the weekend.

337
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,000
<i>Went straight through.</i>

338
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,480
How you know that?

339
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:05,270
I've been around many people who've been shot.

340
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,150
It's your friend.

341
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:27,590
Oh, my God. What did he do?

342
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,440
<i>Brought her directly, Mr. White.</i>

343
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,800
Ain't nobody follow y'all?

344
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:52,070
You go on now. Make the midnight show so they ain't suspicious.

345
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,190
- Yes, sir. 
- You go, too.

346
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,860
I'll be fine.

347
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,710
He'll come after you, you know.

348
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,870
Come after us. Let him come.

349
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,460
Can you even raise your arm?

350
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,540
Brooklyn

351
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,770
You come to me practically begging, some wet-behind-the-ears little shit.

352
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,790
- Nucky-- 
- You assure me your intentions are honorable,

353
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,920
that you and your partner have big plans for the future.

354
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,410
- If you'd just let me speak-- 
- I let you in on the deal.

355
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,990
Things are going great and what do you do the second you get the chance?

356
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,120
- Mr. Thompson-- 
- You stick it up my fucking ass.

357
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,440
We were coerced, Charlie and I.

358
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,880
By Masseria.

359
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,640
- He found out about Tampa from his cousin... 
- Petrucelli.

360
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,530
<i>...then realized he could use it to his advantage.</i>

361
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,700
- As did you and your greaseball partner. 
- He would have killed us if we didn't go along.

362
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,320
You think I fucking won't?

363
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,750
I know that is a distinct possibility, though I do pray to God it doesn't happen.

364
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,290
If it were strictly up to me, sir, I'd have nothing to do with narcotics.

365
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:56,220
There is plenty of money in liquor, which is a much safer

366
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,980
and eminently more socially acceptable--

367
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:03,550
You've got two seconds to drop the fucking Boy Scout routine or you're going in that hole.

368
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,770
There's a fortune to be made in heroin.

369
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,320
Millions and millions of dollars.

370
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,840
Now I don't know about you,

371
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,300
but the way I saw it, it was the same life I was risking either way.

372
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,820
I'm begging you, Mr. Thompson. Please.

373
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,010
What would you have done if you were me?

374
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,670
- You're going to call him. 
- Call who?

375
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,460
Masseria. If he'd like to see you

376
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,420
or his heroin ever again,

377
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,650
tell him to get his ass down here.

378
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,400
Chalky White left a message. Says it's urgent.

379
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:13,000
You're set for 2:00 with the Palm Court. Mr. Murphy is running five minutes late.

380
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,610
Remind me to stick it to him later.

381
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,490
And do me a favor.

382
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,430
Make sure these trade confirmations get filed.

383
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,890
Anaconda Realty?

384
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:28,090
Redstone, some of these other dubs, they're down by 80%.

385
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,810
I'll tell you, they say these kikes are smart.

386
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:36,290
Well, this one's dumb as a doornail with the deepest pockets I've ever seen.

387
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:41,130
- They're no match for you, sir. 
- They're greedy, every last one of them.

388
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,130
Redstone included.

389
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:46,160
Thinks he can get rich without doing a thing.

390
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,170
Well, the more fool him.

391
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,250
I'd like to take the new Duesenberg for a test drive.

392
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,660
There's a number for a salesman on my desk somewhere.

393
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,270
Consider it done.

394
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,640
That's what Valentino drives, you know.

395
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,480
It's warm, but it's all I can find.

396
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,840
- They keep the rest locked up. 
- It's fine, thank you.

397
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,400
How we get to Narcisse?

398
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,620
May we have some privacy, please?

399
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,400
Of course.

400
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,540
Are you thinking straight about any of this?

401
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,960
She put the knife in Purnsley back.

402
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,610
He came to see me last night. Narcisse.

403
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,700
- What he offer? 
- It doesn't matter.

404
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,240
But what he wants is you on a slab.

405
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,770
What you want?

406
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,540
I can tell you what I don't want, and that's a fucking war.

407
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,940
You okay?

408
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,250
Been worse.

409
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,560
You've been better, too.

410
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,970
So push come to shove,

411
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,330
what happen then?

412
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,250
I'm here, aren't I?

413
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,140
You said you ain't want no war.

414
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:49,200
I don't want the trots either, but when I get them, I deal with it.

415
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,650
You know, someone once told me all of man's problems come from his inability

416
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,170
to just sit in a room.

417
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,360
Doing that right now.

418
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,360
Then I suppose your troubles are over.

419
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,370
Don't do anything until you hear from me.

420
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,040
<i>...and as a devoted friend</i>

421
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,710
<i>of the good and decent people of the Northside,</i>

422
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,160
I vow this--

423
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,540
neither I nor the members of the sheriff's department

424
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,480
will rest until every last one of the cowardly perpetrators

425
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,850
of this heinous attack are brought to justice.

426
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,030
Thank you.

427
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,090
Mr. Mayor, is it true

428
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,840
Chalky White is being sought for questioning?

429
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,140
Mr. Mayor, will the city rebuild the UNIA office?

430
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,060
- <i>Harry, help me with this lamp.</i> 
- <i>All right, got it.</i>

431
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,440
Ah, Nucky Thompson.

432
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,050
Always a pleasure.

433
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,590
Perhaps for you.

434
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,350
Things look different during the day, no?

435
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,120
You see all the-- how you say?

436
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,450
The flaws.

437
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,470
I've always preferred bringing things to light.

438
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:46,000
Meyer, now why you so blue?

439
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,770
It could have something to do with the heroin you had him import.

440
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:53,560
Ah, <i>si.</i> He mention this to me when he called.

441
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,450
So what do you have to say for yourself?

442
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,400
We wait, huh?

443
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,090
???

444
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,530
What partner?

445
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,360
Forgive me my tardiness.

446
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,230
<i>It is a quality</i> <i>I deplore in others.</i>

447
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,570
Ah, no. We just get started.

448
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,140
What the hell is going on?

449
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,230
The world is going on, Mr. Thompson.

450
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,470
Without you, depending on what passes here today.

451
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:34,050
- You two are partners? 
- In a manner of speaking, yes.

452
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,570
As you've deduced, I am deeply entrenched in the business of providing heroin

453
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,710
to those wretched souls who desire it.

454
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:45,140
Mr. Masseria and I have recently embarked on an arrangement

455
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,850
wherein he will supply me with product via Tampa.

456
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,280
Using my trucks for delivery.

457
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,150
- So you see. 
- We do business already, the three of us.

458
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,230
And if I don't like it?

459
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:06,180
<i>I should paint you a picture,</i> but I assure you it would not be pretty.

460
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:09,290
There is money to be made, Mr. Thompson.

461
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,110
A very great deal of it.

462
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,630
I will not be your friend, but I will be an able partner.

463
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:19,190
One far more dependable than you've ever had before.

464
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,590
- Just like that? 
- <i>No.</i>

465
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,210
I will require your full support on the Northside

466
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,430
to include you delivering your Mr. White
to me personally.

467
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,850
- This is nonnegotiable. 
- What do I get?

468
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,640
What do you want?

469
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,700
For starters, I want my fucking share.

470
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:48,300
<i>One third of any heroin</i> <i>already imported.</i>

471
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,200
And one third of any imported in the future.

472
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:00,420
So we have struck a bargain, then?

473
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,620
Yes.

474
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,370
You will not be sorry, Mr. Thompson.

475
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,550
I see great days ahead.

476
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,840
<i>The mayor will be right with you, Mr. Thompson.</i>

477
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,970
- Anything from Knox? 
- Can't find him.

478
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,990
<i>Please hold for Mayor Bader.</i>

479
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,110
<i>- Hello?</i> 
- Ed, it's me.

480
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,330
- Nucky. 
- <i>Listen to me clearly.</i>

481
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,690
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

482
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:49,580
I need you to send two sheriff's deputies to get Chalky White out of town.

483
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,370
Okay.

484
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,180
Fella goes to a drugstore to buy rubbers.

485
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,530
The guy goes, "You want a bag with that?"

486
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,860
Fella says, "No, thanks, she ain't that ugly."

487
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,280
How do you make your wife scream while you're having sex?

488
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,880
Call her, tell her about it.

489
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,110
<i>All right.</i>

490
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,320
All right, I'm heading out.

491
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,190
Johnny, stay. Have a drink.

492
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,950
I'll catch your matinee performance tomorrow.

493
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,750
Another round.

494
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,570
- What's that called? 
- Tom Collins.

495
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,620
- I'll kill that bum. 
- Oh.

496
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,770
What's a good bar and a good woman have in common?

497
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,800
<i>I don't know.</i>

498
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,930
Liquor in the front, poker in the back.

499
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,590
- You've never--? 
- Al, you got a call.

500
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,960
Who is it?

501
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,030
- <i>He didn't say.</i> 
- Take a message.

502
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,270
Said it's important.

503
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,050
I'll take it in there. Come on.

504
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,340
- Hello. <i>
- This Al?</i>

505
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,660
Yeah, who's this?

506
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,250
- <i>Never mind who it is.</i> 
- Yeah? Then what the fuck do you want?

507
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,490
<i>Nothing. I was just calling to say good-bye.</i>

508
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,950
Down! Get down!

509
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,690
The Hawthorne Inn

510
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,490
Ralph! Ralphie!

511
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,990
You okay?

512
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,670
<i>I'm all right.</i>

513
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,900
Oh, my God!

514
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,900
Sweet, merciful Jesus. Oh, my God.

515
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,320
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

516
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,580
Well, lucky for John he left when he did, huh?

517
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,030
You okay?

518
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,240
Are you sure I can't offer you something else?

519
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,960
I'm fine, thank you. Please.

520
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,680
I'm too nervous to eat.

521
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,960
You needn't worry. I'm a married man.

522
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,910
You must be joking.

523
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,190
I am.

524
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,820
Though what would Mr. Thompson think?

525
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,720
He can think what he wants.

526
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,520
My life is my own.

527
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:20,810
Not that this is that. This is business.

528
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:24,560
Drink your tea. It settles the nerves.

529
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,780
It's impossible to get ahead.

530
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,830
And believe me, I've tried.

531
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,260
I work hard, I save my--

532
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,890
You owe no one any explanations, Miss Rohan.

533
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,270
Mr. Bennett--

534
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,180
Mr. Bennett is a criminal no different than--

535
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,040
Than me?

536
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,210
I was going to say my husband.

537
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:00,000
Though to be fair, one could paint me with that same brush.

538
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,160
Anaconda Realty. Mr. Bennett and his partners own the company.

539
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,750
He bought more shares this afternoon.

540
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,660
You should do so yourself as soon as possible.

541
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:25,860
30,000 shares preferred stock. You shouldn't sell until he does.

542
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,130
I'll let you know when that happens.

543
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,770
In return for what?

544
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,250
A rent-free apartment guaranteed for five years.

545
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,790
A safe neighborhood with rooms for the children.

546
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,190
You'll accept nothing from Mr. Thompson, yet you will from me?

547
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,080
I earned this.

548
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,650
And when it's over, I owe you nothing.

549
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,250
We have a deal.

550
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,870
Very well.

551
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,030
I've never done business with a woman before.

552
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,230
Well, how did you like it?

553
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,830
Quite the treat.

554
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,140
You got peoples anywhere?

555
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:45,140
Just here in this room.

556
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,240
You?

557
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,560
You stay here, wait till morning.

558
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:56,570
Catch a train out west. You'll be safe there.

559
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,230
I'm going wherever you go.

560
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,850
They're here.

561
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,990
Mr. White? Climb in the back.

562
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,320
Crouch down a little.

563
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:26,950
Uncle Nucky.

564
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,030
Will, what are you doing here?

565
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,300
I tried to call. The line was busy.

566
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,970
Want a drink?

567
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,230
What's wrong?

568
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:39,170
Earlier today the mayor gave a press conference.

569
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:43,130
- I saw the afternoon paper. 
- Well, afterwards he had a meeting.

570
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,430
This colored doctor from the Northside.

571
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,500
- Narcisse? 
- <i>I don't know.</i>

572
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,820
He had a beard. Suit cost more than--

573
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,810
- What did they talk about? 
- <i>I couldn't hear,</i>

574
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:55,350
but they were in Bader's office for over an hour.

575
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,780
Get me the American Legion Hall on Pacific.

576
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,600
Thought we was going to Philly.

577
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,200
We are. Like I said.

578
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,310
Missed the turnoff back there.

579
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,610
That right?

580
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,420
Doing some work on that road.

581
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,590
Taking a different route.

582
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:52,220
 - You all right? 
- Yeah. Shoulder.

583
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,350
Hurt a touch.

584
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,060
You'll feel better with some sleep.

585
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:00,120
Maybe I'll close my eyes a while.

586
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,460
No!

587
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:34,930
Oh, damn!

588
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,770
Steer the car!

589
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,250
<i>Help me get him out.</i>

590
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,100
<i>Carnegie Hall, one month ago.</i>

591
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,570
<i>Nearly 3,000 Negroes</i> <i>in attendance to see Garvey.</i>

592
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:47,080
(Marcus Garvey President of the Black Star)
<i>If anything, his arrest has made him more popular.</i>

593
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,080
Man to his left, that Patterson?

594
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,190
Yes, sir.

595
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:56,390
- We can't get any more inside than him. 
- Pathetic, isn't it?

596
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:01,090
They join his club, attend his mandatory outings.

597
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:04,340
<i>In exchange, he sells them uniforms signifying nothing,</i>

598
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,080
<i>with the profits being used to fund his appeal.</i>

599
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:11,950
That man has done more damage free on bail than most criminals achieve in a lifetime.

600
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:15,050
<i>3,000 Negroes with ideas in their heads--</i>

601
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:16,980
that's a threat worth worrying about.

602
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:28,650
Your tail's wagging, Jim.

603
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:30,190
I got our weak link.

604
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,220
Nucky Thompson-- his brother Eli.

605
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,420
We backed him into a corner.

606
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:42,210
- He's going to connect all the dots for us, Edgar. 
- Our man in Harlem.

607
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:46,000
I may need you from time to time to nourish that relationship.

608
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,680
Yes, Mr. Director.

609
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,310
What is this?

610
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,580
I'm late for a debriefing.

611
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:58,650
Yes, of course, sir.

612
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,060
Since when are you so shy?

613
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,410
This isn't the right place to be.

614
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,090
Do you just want to sit at home moping?

615
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:17,400
What do you have to be so happy about?

616
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,380
Tonight? Nothing at all.

617
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,790
- That's why we're here. 
- Boardwalk Slim.

618
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:26,190
We just commencing.

619
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,480
Sit anywhere you want.

620
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,660
We're allowed to?

621
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,020
After hours.

622
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,710
It's all just us here.

623
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,060
Go on. That's what you came here for.

624
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,740
I'm sorry.

625
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,280
Just lying down for a minute.

626
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,130
No need to apologize. It's an intoxicating brew--

627
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:54,470
the music, the smoke, the alcohol.

628
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,010
I haven't had anything.

629
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:58,960
What's stopping you?

630
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,330
Not in the mood, I suppose.

631
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,400
At times, it seems all there is

632
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,580
is us and our unhappiness.

633
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,320
This is one of those times.

634
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:16,140
Sit. Please.

635
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:24,930
- You're not with the musicians. 
- No.

636
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,640
I came with my brother.

637
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,270
That's him playing with Mr. Coates.

638
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:46,240
You are Mr. White's child?

639
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,560
You know him?

640
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,270
We are intimately associated.

641
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,170
Richard Pastor.

642
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,520
Maybelle White.

643
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,140
- No wonder he's so proud. 
- Do you know where he is?

644
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,990
Alas, no.

645
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:06,920
I've heard the rumors,

646
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,520
the lies.

647
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:13,780
And beneath it all, the old drumbeat of injustice.

648
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,300
Mother won't even get out of bed.

649
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,300
And you are to be married, are you not?

650
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:26,720
Not as of 3:00 this afternoon. <i>Samuel wasn't even there.</i>

651
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,920
His father told me. I think he enjoyed it.

652
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,150
Why must it be the daughters who suffer?

653
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:37,000
That's the funny thing. I'm not suffering.

654
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:39,330
I'm--

655
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,040
I don't know what I am.

656
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45,300
Except something I'm not supposed to be.

657
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,210
Dangerous...

658
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:50,030
for people like us.

659
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,300
Like us?

660
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:03,640
To be what we are, where we are,

661
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,240
and dare to stand free,

662
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,720
what could be more lonely?

663
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:19,550
I was supposed to come here to forget things.

664
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,470
Then go

665
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:27,940
and forget.

666
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,520
What the fuck's going on? You've got the Seventh Regiment out there.

667
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,270
Bader's turned. He's in Narcisse's pocket.

668
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:17,390
- What? 
- You reach anyone yet?

669
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:20,120
He's locked inside his office preparing a statement.

670
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,910
<i>Word is two deputies are dead on the Pike.</i>

671
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:27,200
- Why are you here? 
- <i>He's doing his job, Eli.</i>

672
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,280
Why else would I put him next to Bader?

673
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,930
You need to leave this room.

674
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:36,500
He's already heard it all.

675
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,440
This is the life you want?

676
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:51,840
Pop, isn't it what we do?

677
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:03,590
All right.

678
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,960
Let's get it sorted out.

679
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:16,660
