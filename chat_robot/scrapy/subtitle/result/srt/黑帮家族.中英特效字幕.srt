3
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How should I know?

4
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Papa.

5
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? Hello?

6
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

7
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only real question we should ask ourselves during our existence is

8
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how much is a man's life worth?

9
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Knowing what you're worth is like knowing what day you're gonna die.

10
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me? I'm worth $20 million,

11
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'd hand over every last dollar to get my old life back.

12
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:32,710


13
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetie? Wake up,we're here.

14
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Fuck. It's about time. - Warren. Language.

15
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom,we've been on the road 11 hours

16
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it smells like a skunk's butt-crack back here.

17
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's no reason to talk like a punk.

18
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's the dog. - Yeah. No kidding it's the dog.

19
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you washed him once in a while

20
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like I asked you to,we wouldn't have this problem.

21
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,yeah. We're looking for number ten.

22
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Next,on the left. - There are no numbers.

23
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,I know. Stansfield said that. That's it,yeah.

24
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,no,the left,and then...

25
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it up there. Right.

26
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Over here.

27
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

28
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it.

29
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No electricity?

30
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,there is,but they must have turned the power off.

31
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mom,what are you doing? - Scaring the rats away.

32
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There are rats here? - Who knows? You never know.

33
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm not staying here if there are rats. - Belle,don't start,please.

34
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway,your father can't stand them. Give him 24 hours,

35
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he'll have killed every single rodent in the place.

36
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Belle,you're upstairs on the right. Warren,opposite your sister.

37
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's cold here. - Well,I'll make a fire.

38
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh?

39
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Idiots forgot the TV again.

40
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Tomorrow,they said. - "Tomorrow," that's their favorite word.

41
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,you two,don't chew me out whenever anything is missing.

42
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go see,talk to them yourselves.

43
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does anybody know what this place is called?

44
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cholong-sur-Avre,Normandy.

45
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Avre part is a river.

46
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides our boys landing here in '44,what's Normandy famous for?

47
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Camembert. - Calvados.

48
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mm.

49
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Riviera had both those things,and sunshine.

50
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,so did Paris.

51
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,right. But here is where we live now,where they make the cheese,

52
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that's it,so get used to the real world.

53
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Malavita?

54
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you are. Good dog.

55
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,hon. You want a hand with the bags?

56
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,no,no,I got it,I got it.

57
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the kids to sleep,they gotta get ready for school tomorrow.

58
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

59
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know it wasn't you,but I couldn't say nothing.

60
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where the hell did you go?

61
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Checking out the property. - It's so big?

62
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just getting my bearings.

63
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was trying to help the dog find himself a spot.

64
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Tomorrow,I'll find mine. - Oh,good.

65
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No cereals,no toast,no peanut butter.

66
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you'll have to make do with the apple donuts

67
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got from the bakery this morning.

68
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where's this school at? - I've drawn them a map.

69
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Do we still have the same names? - No,we are the Blake family.

70
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cool.

71
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just in case.

72
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Your hair is damp. - Mom,it's fine.

73
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Have a good day. - Bye,Dad.

74
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Love you. - Love you too.

75
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna go check out the town

76
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- and get some groceries. - All right.

77
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try not to slob around all day in your robe,OK?

78
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No,'cause of the neighbors? - No,for your morale.

79
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My morale is OK,honey. Don't worry about me. I'm just a little out of it,

80
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you adjust more easily than I do to these things.

81
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do we say if we run into the neighbors?

82
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just give me some time to think about that. In the meantime,

83
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just give them a nice smile,and that'll give us time to come up with an idea.

84
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Stansfield asked me to make sure

85
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you don't step outside the front gate.

86
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Until when? - Until he gets here.

87
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're not supposed to mention the Riviera.

88
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are we from then?

89
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The States,sweetie.

90
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not looking good.

91
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,we're playing in the minor league now.

92
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We'll debrief at lunch? - OK.

93
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

94
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Voila'. - Mm. Thank you,miss.

95
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there anything in this area worth seeing?

96
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know,museum,monument...?

97
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is a pressing museum machine,uh,at Verneuil.

98
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um... There's St. Cecilia's Church,

99
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}uh,with it,mm,15th century stained-glass windows.

100
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Can I walk there from here?

101
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. It's next town,20 kilometers.

102
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next town...

103
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're the Yank? - What do you want?

104
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're American,you must be rich.

105
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow,you must have read some pretty big books

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that was never gonna happen.

00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:46,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know,France is a favorite destination for foreigners. Are you staying long?

178
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,I've never stayed long anywhere. We move around a lot.

179

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,no. Well,maybe one day,but now it's just history.

183
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The landings. It's a commission. That's why we're here.

184
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Landings. That's a vast subject. - Yeah.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My angle? Well,the Marines. It's a kind of a tribute to them.

187
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought there were only Gl's involved in the landings.

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,but I'm going to discuss the Army

00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the core of it and so on,starting with the fleets.

190
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know,before the landings,there was the boardings.

00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure. I guess you'll be devoting a chapter to Operation Overlord.

192
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,I don't think a single chapter could cover that.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I mean,nothing like you. I only started a few months ago.

215
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only one I'm missing is PSG's number eight.

216
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll have to check,but I think I may be able to help you out with that.

217
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you have it,honestly,I'll give anything you want for it.

218
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a deal,man.

219
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. You want a ride?

220
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks,but I've been sitting all day. It's good for me to walk.

221
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure,but it's a chance to get to know each other.

222
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And show you round town. - It won't take long,you know.

223
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,Miss America.

224
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a quick ride to welcome you to our beautiful town.

225
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this way,they get to improve their English.

226
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lost?

227
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just think I missed a turn.

228
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where do you live? - Rue des Favorites.

229
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aah. That is miles away. It'll be dark before you get home.

230
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open the door.

231
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So?

232
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a quick ride.

233
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the boss.

234
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,we aren't leaving town,are we?

235
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to see the leisure park where everybody meets up at the weekend.

236
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Do you like swimming? - Sure.

237
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got the feeling Miss America's gonna knock 'em dead at the pool.

238
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you guys doing? - Just taking a little break.

239
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,well,I think I should get home.

240
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a little much for my first day.

241
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,relax.

242
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is just five minutes to get to know each other better.

243
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get off! Get off! Get off!

244
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,350


245
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,boys,

246
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if this is your approach to women,

247
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're not gonna get very far.

248
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Girls are not some toys that you fuck in the park.

249
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK? Your future depends on women.

250
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you care about your future?

251
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So take care of them,or else you're not gonna have one.

252
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,780


253
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey. - Mom bought supplies for the whole year.

254
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did she find any peanut butter? - You're joking.

255
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey-

256
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hi,honey. - Hey.

257
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How was your day?

258
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Fine. - Good.

259
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,680


260
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi,Don Luchese. You asked for some ice?

261
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not him.

262
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK,OK,I'll keep looking.

263
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Va bene.

264
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about your teachers? What are they like?

265
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pretty good. - Fucking bad.

266
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Warren,can you please avoid using the word "fuck" in every sentence?

267
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sorry,Mom. - We're not in Brooklyn anymore.

268
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your mother's right,son. We're not in Brooklyn anymore.

269
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In fact,I don't there is anywhere further from Brooklyn than this fucking rat hole.

270
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll get it. Finish up and help your mother clear the dishes.

271
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How was the first day? - It was pretty good.

272
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Anything to report? - Nothing... special,no.

273
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kids? School?

274
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know,they always adjust better than we do.

275
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I heard you already met the neighbor. - The guy on the left,yeah.

276
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What did you talk about? - Nothing much,roses,mostly.

277
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roses,good. You can talk for hours about roses.

278
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,you know,I was thinking...

279
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about this for a profession,a writer?

280
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Writer,good. It explains your sedentary nature.

281
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- OK. Writer it is. - But stick to simple subjects.

282
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Airport novels,children's literature,shit like that.

283
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- A war novel,maybe? - No.

284
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything else?

285
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They forgot the TV. We can't find five boxes.

286
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The mover drove his truck off the ditch,broke the TV.

287
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We ordered a new one,be here this week. Boxes,I don't know.

288
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- All right. - Uh...

289
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:37,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mourad... Mourad,uh...

290
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Benkassem. Guy had a little shop down in Nice. You know...?

291
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,he was the guy that sold the Italian produce to my wife.

292
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He vanished two days ago. You have any idea where he might be?

293
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Why are you asking me?

294
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause you beat the shit out of him two weeks ago,

295
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and if I hadn't been there,the guy would've died.

296
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That "poor guy" tried to sell me a dozen lobsters,

297
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}said they were fresh out of the ocean. I cut into them,

298
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they're frozen,rotten. Could have killed me and my whole family.

299
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell do you want with a dozen lobsters anyway,Fred?

300
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just pooled together with some of the neighbors,that's all.

301
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not allowed to make any business deals,Freddy. None. You remember that?

302
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just trying to earn a little cash,that's all.

303
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell for? You're gonna go take a vacation?

304
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you don't know where Mourad's at?

305
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,but if you find him,you can tell him for me

306
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna pay for those fucking lobsters.

307
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try to fit in,will you,Freddy? I'm getting tired of finding you

308
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:25,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a new place to live every 90 days. Can I rely on you to try?

309
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure,as long as I can rely on you.

310
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what's gonna happen to you and your family when they find you?

311
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're here to make sure that don't happen,right? I mean that's your job.

312
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try not to make my job impossible.

313
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta go. I'll be back in a couple of days.

314
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to leave you Di Cicco and Mimmo.

315
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ooh... I'm gonna sleep better now.

316
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Say hi to Maggie for me. - Yeah,you bet.

317
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What did he say? - Eh... The usual standard bullshit.

318
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Djaramambo...

319
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of fucking name is that?

320
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,Maggie.

321
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hi,babe. - Hello,hello.

322
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,you shouldn't have. Put them right there.

323
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen,I'm gonna go put this down there,OK?

324
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi,guys.

325
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get yourselves something to eat. - OK.

326
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. I'm so glad you could make it.

327
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Willy.

328
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh. Hey,what a party. - Thank you.

329
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,babe.

330
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How you doing? Can I get you anything?

331
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah,get me a scotch and water. - OK.

332
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coming up-

333
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Glad to see ya.

334
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Aah! - What's wrong,honey? What?

335
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No... in the yard in Brooklyn.on.

336
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was dreamin' about...

337
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try not to think about it or you won't get a wink of sleep.

338
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Yeah.

339
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

340
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If the story I'm going to tell you didn't happen to me,

341
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd never be able to make it up.

342
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of the version Stansfield sold everybody,

343
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I alone know what's true and what isn't true.

344
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he's gotta keep his mouth shut,in the line of duty. It's different for me.

345
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck the line of duty. ah I want is for the truth,

346
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the whole truth,to be told just once,to say what really happened.

347
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even if nobody ever reads these words.

348
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maggie? Can you get me a coffee?

349
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maggie,you hear me?

350
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maggie? You don't hear me calling you?

351
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drop the Italian Stallion act,will ya?

352
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey,I was working.

353
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Might we know what you're doing on that typewriter?

354
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,I was,uh,writing.

355
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not buying it,Giovanni,so save your bullshit for the neighbors.

356
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,I told you,I was writing.

357
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can hardly read,and you're gonna drop a book on us

358
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about the Normandy landings? You don't even know who Eisenhower was.

359
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forget the Normandy landings.

360
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's just a decoy. I was writing something else.

361
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So share it with us. What are you writing?

362
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My memoirs.

363
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew it.

364
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stan thinks it's a good idea.

365
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's a good idea,too,as a cover.

366
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not for you to actually write your fucking memoirs.

367
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you realize what a shitstorm this would land us in?

368
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I didn't say I was going to publish it. - I should hope not.

369
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With your photo on the cover? The one and only Giovanni Manzoni.

370
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey,I got to get it out. It's good for me to write the truth.

371
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know,even if I'm the only person that sees it.

372
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta know who I am,you understand?

373
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not through the eyes of my old life or the Feds,but through my own eyes.

374
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey,I understand,but you could have come up with something else.

375
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean,being an author's wife isn't exactly glamorous.

376
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It sounds too much like "trophy wife." You could have consulted me,at least.

377
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gave me architect when we were in the south of France.

378
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh,please... - The whole neighborhood came to me

379
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and asked me to build swimming pools and pizza ovens.

380
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK,you know what,forget about that now.

381
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you could be a plumber for five minutes,I would really appreciate it.

382
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The water in the sink is coming out brown.

383
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you call anybody?

384
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I called the guy,made two appointments,he never showed.

385
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where are you going now? - Working for you.

386
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck.

387
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hi,guys. - Hey,Maggie.

388
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roasted peppers in olive oil,

389
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just how you like them,with lots of garlic.

390
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is really sweet of you,Maggie.

391
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The smell alone takes you back home.

392
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You have any of that bread left? - Yeah.

393
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on then,what are you waiting for?

394
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were supposed to be here at nine in the morning,

395
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you don't show up till about noon. What's that all about?

396
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:43,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,I know. You're sure this time?

397
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You... OK... no,all right,all right.

398
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,I'll be here. I'm not going nowhere,but don't make me wait,please.

399
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,did Stan tell you guys about the barbecue?

400
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

401
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know where Gio came up with the...

402
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Fred. - Fred...

403
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know where he came up with the idea,but he's pretty set on it.

404
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The boss thinks it's a good idea,help you guys make friends in the neighborhood.

405
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Friends"? No swearing,please.

406
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So good. - Mm.

407
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If anybody would have told me I'd be living in the land of cream...

408
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last night,at the restaurant I ate in,

409
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there was cream in the soup,the veal and the apple pie.

410
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God,not to mention the butter.

411
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mamma mia,the butter is even worse. They put it in everything.

412
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's not even natural. - Sorry?

413
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The human body was not designed to combat saturated fat like that.

414
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The butter impregnates the tissues,and then it hardens and settles like silt.

415
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It makes your aorta stiffer than a hockey stick.

416
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whereas olive oil...

417
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:42,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...caresses your insides,leaving nothing behind but its scent.

418
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:46,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's right. Oil's in the Bible. - Yeah.

419
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Merci.

420
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you just ask them to hold the sauce,instead of scraping it off?

421
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're supposed to assimilate,remember?

422
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,but there are limits. Dad's barbecue can't come fast enough.

423
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least,we'll get to eat some decent food for once.

424
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How was your morning? - Busy.

425
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Awesome. - What do you got for me?

426
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

427
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here,your math homework. Can I rely on you when the time comes?

428
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have my word.

429
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got the report on your little business,here.

430
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you give me some time to make a fake one,your folks will never know.

431
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want in return?

432
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We share the cigarette market 50-50.

433
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Deal?

434
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ooh... Don't move.

435
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take one of these just before. You'll feel like a horse.

436
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the man.

437
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're a pervert. - Thanks. What about you?

438
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,some girl took my pink pencil case.

439
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're joking? Find out who did it?

440
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It took a while,but eventually I found it.

441
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're a maniac. - Thank you.

442
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know who that is?

443
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. He's a college student who's replacing

444
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Whale while she's on maternity leave.

445
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He started yesterday. All the senior skanks are on the case.

446
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So,you'll have your work out out for you.

447
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On top of that,he's obsessive about math.

448
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's studying for some really tough exam.

449
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Math geeks are such a pain in the ass.

450
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you just get a jock instead. They think less.

451
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you notice first about a guy?

452
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His eyes.

453
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The family at number 12,what are they like?

454
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The mother's a klepto.

455
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She got banned from the mall in Alengon.

456
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The father,he had a bypass surgery.

457
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Other than that,nothing special.

458
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Except for the kid being held back in seventh grade.

459
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think they'll come to the barbecue?

460
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,don't worry,everybody's gonna be there.

461
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They can't wait to check you guys out.

462
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's the weekend's main event. - What the hell is this? It's good.

463
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Calvados. - What the fuck is Calvados?

464
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's good,it keeps you warm. You get a little...

465
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's happened to me before. - Remember that job in Texas?

466
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey... Ramirez,the plumber.

467
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said five minutes,that was 45 minutes ago.

468
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:45,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what we say around here? Better late than never.

469
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you,excuse me.

470
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at the state of your pipes. They must be at least 100 years old.

471
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So,that explains the color of the water?

472
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I didn't say that. - What are you saying,then?

473
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm saying it could be the pipes,but it could be an external issue.

474
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- External? - Sure. The mains.

475
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you'd have to take that up with the mayor's office.

476
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So,what do I do about the pipes now?

477
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- For now? Nothing. - Yeah.

478
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it's a money issue,we could work something out.

479
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Money doesn't solve everything.

480
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you're lucky if you've got money,because renovating your plumbing

481
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is gonna cost you an arm,and maybe a leg,as we say around here.

482
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:36,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If not both arms and both legs,right?

483
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So,what do you think I should do?

484
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You call my wife,you pay 50 percent up front,

485
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you make a new appointment.

486
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're a family of plumbers. My wife keeps the books,

487
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my son's learning the trade at college in Alengon.

488
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're a proud family of plumbers.

489
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father and sons for five generations.

490
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Congratulations. - Thank you.

491
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you,what's your line of work?

492
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me show you.

493
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}AI Capone always said,"Asking polite with a gun in your hand

494
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is better than just asking polite."

495
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for everything.

496
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,my pleasure. Hey,would you get me a little ristretto?

497
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our coffee machine broke during the move.

498
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Coming right up. - Thanks.

499
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night,sir.

500
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night.

501
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:17,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hi,there. - Hi.

502
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I need private lessons. - You need private lessons in math?

503
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unless you have any other specialties?

504
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,no,I only do math.

505
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

506
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So,um...

507
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your level?

508
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's more important,a good level or motivation?

509
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Motivation.

510
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all I have.

511
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,790


512
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,220


513
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,270


514
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,to give you this.

515
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I don't understand is how he could break his legs like this,

516
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by falling down the steps.

517
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:32,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,they're stone steps,so they're pretty steep. Uh...

518
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure,but there are not 200.

519
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This man has as many fractures

520
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as a man who might have fallen from the sixth floor.

521
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:45,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He had his bag on his shoulder and the hammer might have hit and somehow...

522
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That might explain one or two,not 12.

523
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How do you explain 12? - I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

524
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a writer.

525
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know him.

526
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a friend of my husband...

527
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:13,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but he has a beard now.

528
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know where I might find him?

529
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

530
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's vanished too.

531
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have no idea where he could have gone?

532
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,who are you looking for really? My father or this guy?

533
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:31,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know,in our line of work,we have to follow up with every lead.

534
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One clue often leads to another.

535
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about you? Tell us why the FBI is on the case?

536
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's part of a cooperation program between our two countries.

537
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I see your badge?

538
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure.

539
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the next chapters,I'll show myself to be

540
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one of the nastiest bastards ever to walk the earth.

541
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't spare myself,I'll tell the story without trying to make myself look good.

542
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:06,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But in this chapter,I'll do the opposite and demonstrate to you

543
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that if you take a closer look,I'm a good guy.

544
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll prove it to you in ten points,

545
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:14,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a bit like one of Letterman's Late Show top ten lists.

546
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So here we go. Number 10...

547
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am always upfront,always.

548
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You promised me the fucking money. Where's my fucking money?

549
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bust. - Oh,yeah?

550
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number 9: I never look for a scapegoat.

551
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:40,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number 8: If you give me a job,I'll always see it through.

552
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No... No.

553
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number 7: I never showed contempt for people who feared me.

554
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't move for ten minutes,you understand?

555
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:13,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number 6: I never betrayed the guy who gave me my first gun.

556
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you ever work for this man?

557
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:24,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number 5: I never wished any harm on anybody.

558
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey,man. - Hey.

559
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey,what's goin' on? - Hey.

560
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,punk.

561
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,it's all right.

562
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number 4: I lived outside the law,

563
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but only outlaws didn't judge me.

564
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number 3: Anybody who doesn't contradict me

565
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}can expect nothing but good things from me.

566
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No more pictures,you understand?

567
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

568
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Number 2... - Hey,Giovanni...

569
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In my neighborhood,when I was running it,

570
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there was never a single robbery on the street.

571
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People lived and slept easy.

572
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number 1: Of the top ten reasons why I'm a good guy,

573
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't like to cause pain for no reason because

574
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all my sadistic urges are satisfied when I cause pain for a good reason.

575
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait,I'm not fucking finished.

576
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:12,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I thought you quit. - I had.

577
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just one. I needed it.

578
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You all right? - Nothing much.

579
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just the prospect of packing up again and moving

580
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when they find out you killed the plumber.

581
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't kill him. I took him to the hospital.

582
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why'd you beat him to a pulp?

583
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's the only plumber within a radius of 20 miles.

584
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:33,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he disrespected us and he made you wait on him.

585
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey,I survived.

586
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:37,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the guy was tryin' to rip me off.

587
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:40,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He tried to make me change all the pipes without giving me no assurance

588
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that the problem would be solved. So put yourself in my shoes.

589
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:46,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I definitely wouldn't have beat him up. Who's gonna fix the pipes now?

590
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's gonna rebuild the supermarket that burned down the day we got here?

591
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:59,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All these supermarkets going up in smoke everywhere we go.

592
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The plumber told me it might be the main water supply.

593
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna see the mayor tomorrow.

594
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,are you gonna whack the mayor now?

595
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,no,I'm gonna take care of this thing and get to the bottom of it.

596
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,yeah,sure.

597
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:18,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,when you gonna chill out?

598
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:29,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you doing? - I'm talkin' to you.

599
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get me so excited.

600
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're more beautiful than ever when you get angry.

601
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're sick. - Nah,nah.

602
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Maybe I should see a psychiatrist? - Get off me.

603
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you should see a psychiatrist.

604
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:48,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're my psychiatrist. - Oh,God forbid.

605
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know,what even gets me more turned on?

606
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you start lighting those fires everywhere.

607
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't know what you're talking about. - You don't?

608
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK,Gio,not here. Come on,come on.

609
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get off me. - No,here. Here.

610
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:10,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then in the hallway. We'll finish at the kitchen.

611
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say,who's this Henri you invited?

612
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:16,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody told you about him?

613
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,he called to see what time the barbecue started.

614
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He did? - Yeah. So,who is he?

615
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's this teacher at the school.

616
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:26,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He will be a teacher. He has his exams soon

617
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he's been giving me private lessons.

618
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:32,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Private lessons? - Math lessons,Mom.

619
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:34,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. You have condoms,at least?

620
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mom! - What?

621
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We do the lessons at school,in study hall.

622
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So?

623
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know,desire sneaks up on you,honey.

624
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:46,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It never waits for the right time or place.

625
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take your father,for example.

626
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The first time he jumped on me was in church,

627
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:52,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the very last place I expected to lose my virginity.

628
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna be different for me,Mom.

629
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna choose the time and the place,

630
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it will be with the love of my life.

631
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetheart,couldn't you have got something else other than Coke?

632
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why? This is what they expect from us. - What,Coke?

633
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,American slop. Fatty,greasy Yankee chow.

634
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what they expect,pornographic food.

635
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't even think about using that vocabulary in front of your father.

636
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,Mom,listen,the French are sick of healthy eating

637
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and macrobiotic,steamed vegetables and seaweed.

638
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK,what they expect is color,noise and excess.

639
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They want rodeo and two-pound steaks.

640
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm not so sure. - Can you just trust me,please?

641
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:35,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's going to be a line out the door like it's a whorehouse.

642
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:44,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The whole town's coming through. - Yeah. Looks like they're a big hit.

643
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep.

644
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:48,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes,boss. - How's it going?

645
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pretty good. - I'll be there in an hour.

646
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- OK. - Meanwhile,go join the party.

647
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you sure? - You're the neighbor,right?

648
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:59,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- OK. - So,get over there,and join the party.

649
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

650
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:04,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What did he say? - We gotta go to the party.

651
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm relying on you two. Don't mess this up.

652
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Polite,ordinary,nothing eccentric,OK?

653
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- OK. - Warren,did you call your father?

654
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,he said he'd come as soon as he finished his chapter.

655
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh God. - What does that mean,his chapter?

656
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have no idea. But for the survival of the species,

657
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's best if the whole world doesn't find out.

658
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- OK. Yep. - OK? All right.

659
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. Welcome.

660
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you so much for coming.

661
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:40,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,those are beautiful. Thank you so much.

662
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello,I'm Maggie. Oh,we're neighbors.

663
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello,nice to meet you. This is my son Warren.

664
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetie,will you put these in water?

665
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My daughter Belle. Hello,nice to meet you. Welcome.

666
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:53,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come in,make yourself at home. I'm Maggie.

667
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

668
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I confess I'm curious to taste a real hamburger made by real Americans.

669
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:12,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,hopefully,in less than ten minutes,your wish will be fulfilled.

670
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:15,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're going to take that silverware and put it back where you found it,

671
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:18,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}nice and easy,or else I'm gonna break both your arms.

672
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be right there.

673
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. Sweetheart...

674
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to go find your father and tell him

675
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if he hasn't lit his barbecue in the next five minutes,

676
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:36,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll burn the fucking house down.

677
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:39,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Excuse me. - Sorry to interrupt.

678
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Belle...

679
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody's waiting for you to start the barbecue.

680
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK,yeah.

681
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:53,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You OK? - Yeah.

682
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Writing is intense.

683
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel like I've been lookin' at myself in a mirror all day.

684
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:08,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You gonna be OK? - Yeah.

685
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just,I was thinkin' about you and your brother.

686
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How I always didn't do the right thing by both of you and...

687
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I put you in a tricky situation...

688
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I regret that.

689
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad. Dad,what are you talking about?

690
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:37,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the best Dad anybody could ever ask for.

691
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:43,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Really? - Fuck,yeah.

692
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,let's go party then.

693
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:58,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You OK,boys? - Oh,yeah.

694
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:01,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mag,you make the best pasta. - Aw,thanks.

695
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You give yourself away with pasta like this. Everybody'll realize you're actual Italians.

696
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:08,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I added a little cream to throw the people off the scent.

697
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:14,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not how you do it,Mr. Blake. You put too much charcoal on too soon.

698
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:17,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know,this isn't the first time I prepared a barbeque.

699
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I build a wood fire. It takes longer,but the quality is so much better.

700
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your charcoal isn't good quality.

701
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to get it from Michel on the north side of town.

702
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:28,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Or use very dry wood. - You'll never get it started.

703
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should empty it out and start over. It will be quicker.

704
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:33,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah,Mr. Blake,one cannot possess every talent,

705
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:36,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the talent to write beautiful words,and the talent to light fires.

706
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,Stan.

707
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stand me to a drink,Fred?

708
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:04,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Give a couple minutes to get this baby rocked.

709
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll meet you at the bar. - Take your time.

710
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:16,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gentlemen,in two minutes,your burgers will be sizzling and cooked to perfection.

711
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:19,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good crowd.

712
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Congratulations,Fred. It's a huge success.

713
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:25,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,it's missing a... I don't know,a certain je ne sais quoi.

714
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,you miss the social charm of a bunch of wiseguys

715
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}sitting around in the shade. Huh?

716
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,Stan,Have some respect.

717
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those guys were my family. Even if I snitched on them,

718
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:38,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they were still my family and those were the best years of my life.

719
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Whalberg asked about you. - Yeah,Whalberg?

720
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:44,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice to know he's concerned about me.

721
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hear he got himself elected to the Senate?

722
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's always been his big dream.

723
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's even got a weekly meeting at the White House.

724
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:52,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smart man. Great. So,what did he want?

725
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:55,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,he just wants to know how you're...

726
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What you're doing.

727
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mm. Yeah. Tell him I write.

728
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:05,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did. That's what bothers him.

729
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:10,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh... He's got nothin' to worry about.

730
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:14,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At this point,I've just got a few pages down. It's all random stuff.

731
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:16,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You intend to tell the whole story?

732
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stan,how could anybody tell the whole story?

733
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I want people to believe me,I gotta tone it down.

734
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Otherwise they'll think I made the whole fucking thing up.

735
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want people to read it?

736
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At this point,that would be pretentious.

737
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK,what's funny,Fred?

738
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:35,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't written a fucking word yet and all of a sudden,

739
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:37,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a famous writer at the White House.

740
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you so much for coming. These are homemade donuts.

741
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thank you very much. Bye-bye. - Au revoir.

742
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

743
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bye-bye. - Au revoir.

744
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:02,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He didn't come?

745
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,but he only said "maybe."

746
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He has an exam next week. - Aw...

747
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:11,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen,sweetie,I don't know the boy,but you have to be a bit of a dork

748
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:14,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to prefer math to a beautiful girl,you know what I'm saying?

749
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the time I'm done with him,he won't be able to count with his fingers.

750
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:19,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the spirit.

751
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey,Maggie. - Hey,Stan,thanks for coming.

752
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,help me clear up.

753
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:28,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,uh... You knew Vinnie Vitale,right,Fred?

754
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Silly me,he was one of your guys.

755
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway,Auggie Campania ratted him out,

756
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:39,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the carnage when we went by to pick him up,very sad.

757
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:40,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Auggie gave us the whole clan.

758
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We collared practically every one of them and that's down to you,Freddy.

759
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:44,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean,Stan?

760
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were the first one to set a good example,by snitching on your own family.

761
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,everybody thinks you're poolside someplace,

762
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}tanning your ass off.

763
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are the best advertisement we ever had.

764
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:03,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,thanks for the party,and we'll see you soon.

765
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't mention it.

766
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck.

767
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you ever noticed the number of things

768
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad is capable of expressing just with the word "fuck"?

769
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:33,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Trying to say Dad's illiterate? - No...

770
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean,he's a good 0l' boy,so you know

771
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he talks to be understood,not just to sound good.

772
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So,from him,a "fuck" can mean,

773
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Holy shit,what did I just get myself into."

774
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:46,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or,"Great pasta." Or "I'm gonna get that guy for that."

775
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So why does a guy like that need to stay up all night writing

776
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:51,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when he could already express the entire range

777
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:54,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of human emotions with a single word?

778
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:58,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So,you see,as I told you,the tests show the water is fine.

779
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:01,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But my water comes out brown when I turn on the faucet.

780
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps your plumbing is a little bit on the old side,quite simply.

781
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,what about the sewage plant I heard about.

782
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's almost brand new. Go and see for yourself.

783
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:14,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Blake,I know the mayor's office is always a perfect scapegoat,

784
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but for once,we didn't do anything.

785
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,sometimes doing nothing makes you just as guilty

786
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as if you did a whole bunch of things.

787
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen,Mr. Blake.

788
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have nothing against foreigners,

789
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:28,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you have only just come here.

790
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let us resolve our difficulties in our own way.

791
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:32,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}True,it can drag on,

792
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:35,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but we always find a solution in the end.

793
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:44,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,Mr. Blake,it was a pleasure to meet you.

794
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pleasure to meet you too,Mr. Mayor.

795
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is really good. You've really improved.

796
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's because I have a good teacher.

797
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps,but soon,you won't need him anymore.

798
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:02,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So when do you take your exams again?

799
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:06,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Next week. - And what happens if you pass?

800
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:12,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,um,I guess,I go to Paris and find a job.

801
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:18,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK,uh... Let's find you something a bit tougher to do.

802
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:21,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go,a turbine problem.

803
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The water is already brown when it reaches us.

804
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:28,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are at the end of the chain.

805
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So why does everybody give us shit about this?

806
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you go and see who is really responsible?

807
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd be happy to. Just give me one clue and I promise you,

808
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}nobody will give you a hard time after that.

809
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:44,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Chemical fertilizers turn the water brown. - Fertilizers?

810
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And there are not 50 factories producing fertilizers around here.

811
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's only one.

812
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry to bother you.

813
00:56:56,950 --> 00:57:01,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know,Jesus,that my family tries your patience.

814
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:06,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you know,deep down,they're not bad people.

815
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They just need you to guide them,

816
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:12,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'm relying on you,

817
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:17,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I can't do it all on my own.

818
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amen.

819
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:29,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father,you gave me a start.

820
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If there's one place you shouldn't be frightened,it's in church.

821
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,you're right. I'm sorry.

822
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:38,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know,this isn't the first time I've seen you in the middle of the day,

823
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:41,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}praying on your own,but never at mass.

824
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,well,I come as often as I can.

825
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:48,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was expecting a parishioner,who can't make it apparently.

826
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:51,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you like to take his place for confession?

827
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me?

828
00:57:54,510 --> 00:58:00,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,I confess it's been years since I went to confession.

829
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:04,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,then that's one thing at least you should ask forgiveness for.

830
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:13,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I imagine that you're bound by some sort of confidentiality clause.

831
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:15,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing I say leaves the building.

832
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:18,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are bound by something far more sacred

833
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,580

880
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:29,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,a guy from Milan who spent some time here introduced me to this.

881
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:34,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not as creamy as Irish coffee,but less sickly.

885
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:52,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've learned four languages in my time here and started Chinese lessons recently.

886
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I butchered them for decades in Chinatown,

887
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:56,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}never understanding a damn word they said.

01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought I owed them that much,at least.

889
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,it's French.

890
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:09,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"If it's 'Godunov' for you,it's... it's 'good enough' for me."

01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:15,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go get Morales.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh,you're a biker? - Yes,always have been.

897
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What can I do for you?

898
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you are not here about this brown water business too.

899
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:46,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid so.

900
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:50,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If only we could put a stop to this archaic way of thinking,

901

902
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,believe me,you're preaching to the converted.

903
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:56,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you know,it's when I turn my water on in my kitchen,

904
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it comes out brown,I don't want brown water.

905
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:01,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I want my water crystal-clear... - Buy bottled water then.

906
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If there is one thing I don't like,it's being interrupted.

907
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:31,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I'm going to ask you one more time,and I advise you to pay close attention.

908
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:36,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I turn on my faucet,and the water comes out brown,

909
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want my water brown,I want it crystal-clear.

910

913
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:48,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is this turbine?

916
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. My children.

917
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:05,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You open your big mouth about this,you won't have no children no more.

918
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:48,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

919
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:51,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just passing the time,waiting on you.

920
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:58,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where you been? - I was just walking the dog.

921
01:04:58,390 --> 01:04:59,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mm-hmm.

922
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You read the manuscript?

923
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:06,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my job,Fred. Don't get mad,I'm supposed to be keeping an eye on you.

924
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What am I to expect next time? You come out of my toilet bowl?

925
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,not me,but Di Cicco could any minute.

926
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:15,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You amaze me,Fred. Really.

927
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:17,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not as illiterate as you seem.

928
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:22,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a bit rough around the edges,but you got a style all your own.

929
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:26,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I particularly enjoyed your account of the peace negotiations

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with the Esteban family after your turf wars.

931
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:34,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You made a "concession," that's what's they call a euphemism,Freddy.

932
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:36,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You practically kissed his smelly Colombian ass that day.

933
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:39,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stan,I thought we had an agreement. We wouldn't insult each other.

934
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep your ass in this chair,you wouldn't be feeling insulted right now.

935
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:47,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On the other hand,your account of me is a bit harsh.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Eyes... colder than a rotten fish."

939
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:03,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh,"He'd be capable of hauling his own mother

940
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:05,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}into court for fudging on her taxes."

941
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:09,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is just awkward,hackneyed syntax. Freddy,take it easy.

942
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You escaped our surveillance and that is enough for me to terminate

943
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:16,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Witness Protection Program right now,and there's not a goddamn thing

944
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all your cronies in Washington could do about it.

945
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you plan another stunt like this,

946
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna put an electronic bracelet on your ankle.

947
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stan,don't you think you're overreacting a little too much?

948
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is all this grief about? A couple of pages

949
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}written in a garage in the middle of nowhere?

950
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This gets out,you're dead.

951
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:36,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stan,we're all gonna die.

952
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'll be honest with ya.

953
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:40,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dying for these words...

954
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:44,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is always nobler than the death I'm destined for.

955
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

956
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:48,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me the rest of it to read when you're finished.

957
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Deal?

958
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:52,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got a real page-turner here.

959
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:57,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't wait to see how it ends.

960
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:24,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh... Belle. Uh... I'm sorry.

961
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today is a special day for me.

962
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:29,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. Your exam's tomorrow.

963
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:33,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. My train is at 7:15 this evening,and...

964
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We won't do any exercises tonight.

965
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't intend to.

966
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:44,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I,uh... put together some exercises

967
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:47,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for you to do,uh,at home.

968
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're equations.

969
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I have something that I'd like you to solve.

970
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's more beautiful than life itself...

971
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:02,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...devours you inside...

972
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:06,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...makes you laugh and cry all day...

973
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and makes you do anything...

974
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...anytime...

975
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...any place?

976
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:27,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Belle...

977
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:34,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the answer is?

978
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:14,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mmm! Fuck!

979
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Gio. - Aw,honey,I can't...

980
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:20,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry,but only a good old-fashioned expression is worthy of your pasta.

981
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:24,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is so good that's the only way you describe it: "fucking good."

982
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:25,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the ultimate compliment.

983
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:27,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd happily do without your fucking compliments.

984
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:30,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey,it's so good,it's better than New York.

985
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:32,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,your memory's playing tricks on you,honey.

986
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These tomatoes are from Spain. There's no flavor whatsoever.

987
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,Alzheimer's coming to get you,Dad?

988
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:39,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,OK. But,you know,

989
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:41,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's something you do that's just amazing.

990
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,nostalgia compensates for the lack of flavors

991
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:47,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and stimulates the brain to recreate all the missing pieces.

992
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:49,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this with you guys? Huh?

993
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm trying to pay your mother a compliment over here,

994
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:53,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you guys are going off on some other nonsense.

995
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh? What's wrong with this family?

996
01:09:57,690 --> 01:10:00,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this now? Hey. Where's she going?

997
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She leaves the table in the middle of dinner?

998
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think she has a little crush on someone.

999
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,it's a math geek.

1000
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:08,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A crush? And I'm the last to know,obviously.

1001
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:11,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It hasn't gone past first base so far,I don't think.

1002
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,that's good to know,but the guy just thinks he can call

1003
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}at any time of the day or night? What are we doing here?

1004
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:16,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gio,it's fine.

1005
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not fine. It's almost nine o'clock.

1006
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:23,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not a decent time for anybody to be calling us. What are we doing?

1007
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dad. It's for you. - Yeah.

1008
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:36,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1009
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:39,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good evening. This is Mr. Lemercier.

1010
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:42,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We met a few weeks ago at your barbecue. I'm the English teacher.

1011
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,yeah,yeah. I know you,yeah. Right,right.

1012
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:52,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So what can I do for you? - Well,um...

1013
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:55,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've run the Cholong Film Society for nearly five years now,

1014
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on a voluntary basis,of course.

1015
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see,I didn't know that.

1016
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We meet once a month for a film,usually followed by a debate.

1017
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:03,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah.

1018
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:08,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I must say,the arrival of an American writer in Cholong seems like

1019
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:12,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the perfect opportunity to revisit some American classics,

1020
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:16,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I thought of a film that would suit you wonderfully.

1021
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What would that be?

1022
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:20,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some Came Running by Vincente Minnelli.

1023
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:24,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,that rings a bell. That's the one with Sinatra or Dean Martin?

1024
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Both. - What's it about?

1025
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:31,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A writer,who's an army veteran,goes back home with an unfinished novel.

1026
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:37,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And who plays the writer? Frank? - Yeah.

1027
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,let me think that over,and I'll get back to you.

1028
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very gracious of you. Good night,Mr. Blake.

1029
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:44,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thank you,OK. Bye. - Thank you.

1030
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey,Fred. - Who's this? Pluto or Goofy?

1031
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:52,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Di Cicco. What do you mean,"Let me think it over"?

1032
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:56,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't talk to dumbbells. Play the tape for Stan and let him call me.

1033
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:58,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You out of your mind?

1034
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:02,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stan,you told me to integrate,that's what I did. I integrated.

1035
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:05,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He seemed like a nice guy and I didn't want to upset him and risk being unpopular.

1036
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:07,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Unpopular"? Who the hell asked you to be popular?

1037
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:09,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Integrated," "discreet," "nondescript."

1038
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:11,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell are you gonna be doing at a debate

1039
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on American movie classics anyway?

1040
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The subject just... as a writer...

1041
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not a writer,Fred.

1042
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:18,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You even said I had a style all my own.

1043
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're just a mean son of a bitch who managed to save his own ass.

1044
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:22,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stan,I saved my own ass because I don't wanna fucking live

1045
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like a zombie the rest of my life. I paid big time for that right,Stan.

1046
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:29,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The right to live decent,physically,mentally,intellectually.

1047
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:32,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I'm gonna get a copy of that movie,I'm gonna watch it,

1048
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'm gonna think of some interesting stuff to say,

1049
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're gonna come with me to that debate. You understand?

1050
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:38,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And for that,you know what? I promise,

1051
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll give you a good write-up in my memoirs.

1052
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:44,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're insane. - I know.

1053
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:46,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1054
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:50,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll see you at the debate. - OK.

1055
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:55,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't expect me to come to your debate.

1056
01:12:57,370 --> 01:12:58,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for your support.

1057
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Salut,Don Luchese. How are you?

1058
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:10,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm on the trail of Giovanni Manzoni.

1059
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:16,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure? We looked all over the south of France for this guy.

1060
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:18,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The bastard's hiding out in Normandy.

1061
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:22,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Head over there and make him pay. Him and all his family.

1062
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is he exactly?

1063
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:32,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Warren Blake!

1064
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:38,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry up,a little quicker.

1065
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:44,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on.

1066
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Warren Blake.

1067
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:59,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's not much to say about your grades.

1068
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fifteen out of 20,right across the board. No problem there.

1069
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,let's talk about your conduct,

1070
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the 22 complaints I have received about you.

1071
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:14,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Complaints? About what?

1072
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take your pick.

1073
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Assault,corruption,bullying,

1074
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}threatening students,teachers,adults.

1075
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do you want to start?

1076
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:29,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to see my lawyer.

1077
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:37,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My eyes are killing me from watching him too much.

1078
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:41,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well,what's he doing? - Nothing. He's just sitting at his desk.

1079
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:25,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello? - Belle? It's me.

1080
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:27,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know it's you,sweetheart.

1081
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's the boyfriend. - How did it go?

1082
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:33,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. All the stuff I studied for came up.

1083
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:37,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had a quick check afterwards and I think I got pretty much everything right.

1084
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:41,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so proud of you. Are you coming home on the train tonight?

1085
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh,no. I'm going to stay in Paris for a few days.

1086
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:47,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father's in town and I have to start looking for an apartment.

1087
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:51,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,nothing too small and maybe one that has a bathtub.

1088
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:53,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On my budget,it won't be much bigger than a shoebox.

1089
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A shoebox is fine as long as it has a bed.

1090
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Belle,you're a wonderful person.

1091
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amazing,even. And it was an unforgettable experience.

1092
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:08,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An experience?

1093
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,I mean...

1094
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:14,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...a fabulous moment.

1095
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:17,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gave you my heart and soul,

1096
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}things I've never given to anybody before,

1097
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you wanna call it "a fabulous moment"?

1098
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:26,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,you're right. It was much more than that,but...

1099
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:29,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right,it was more than that. I chose you,Henri.

1100
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:33,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Belle,I'm not ready for that. My family doesn't have very much money...

1101
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:35,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What an asshole. - ...and they're relying on me.

1102
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:37,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's not the way to do it. - Come on. Over the phone?

1103
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:39,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't drop everything just like that for...

1104
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:42,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- For...? - Belle,try to understand.

1105
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:47,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's give it a few weeks and maybe we can meet up now and then.

1106
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From door to door?

1107
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:51,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Belle...

1108
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:57,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Love was the only thing

1109
01:16:58,110 --> 01:17:01,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that could take me away from my crazy life.

1110
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was my only hope.

1111
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:07,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you crushed it.

1112
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:17,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Seventeen years old. - Slap him in the face myself.

1113
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's not the way to do it. - Unbelievable.

1114
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:30,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm warning you,Fred. One word out of line,I'll lock you in this house for one year.

1115
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:32,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stan,will you relax?

1116
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not gonna go shake nobody down.

1117
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna go watch a movie at Cholong-sur-Avre.

1118
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:42,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all.

1119
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:45,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Want to walk? - No,we'll take my car.

1120
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:50,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You ever see that movie? - Never heard of it.

1121
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father,I managed to get away.

1122
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:15,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Ow... - You. You can't stay here.

1123
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's wrong? - Your confession has haunted me all week.

1124
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:22,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How can you live such a hellish existence? - Isn't that the point of confessing?

1125
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:26,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your family is the incarnation of evil,

1126
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and your life is a never-ending pact with the devil.

1127
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:33,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave this holy place,for the love of God.

1128
01:19:02,690 --> 01:19:03,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enjoy the show.

1129
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:05,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thank you. - Merci.

1130
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:07,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good crowd. Huh? - Yeah.

1131
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:09,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they'd put your picture out front or in the newspaper,

1132
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:10,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we would have a sell-out.

1133
01:19:10,990 --> 01:19:12,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you gonna moan and groan all night?

1134
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:15,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't you just sit down and relax and enjoy it?

1135
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In our long friendship,this is our first-ever guys' night out.

1136
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Friendship? - Yeah.

1137
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:24,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean,you're probably the guy I hate the most in this whole fucking world,

1138
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:27,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but we've known each other what,nine,ten years already?

1139
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:29,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My freedom is based on the deep respect that I have for you.

1140
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Explain how that works. How can we have a friendship when you hate me?

1141
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:36,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It works just fine. Look at my best friends,I killed them all.

1142
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:43,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just kidding.

1143
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh... My dear friends,

1144
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:50,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}apologies for the delay which was due to certain technical issues.

1145
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:54,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unfortunately as has happened on two previous occasions,

1146
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:58,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}la Cinémathéque de Normandie has sent us the wrong film.

1147
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:00,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,that's one problem solved.

1148
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:04,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on,I'll buy you a drink. - But in this unfortunate mix-up,

1149
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:08,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we received another American film,also set in the US.

1150
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:11,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm sure that Mr. Blake,as a New Yorker,will be able to confirm,

1151
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would say,the authenticity of the film's setting.

1152
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:20,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If,of course,he does us the honor of... of staying?

1153
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh... I'll try,yeah. I'll try my best. Yeah,sure.

1154
01:20:25,150 --> 01:20:27,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1155
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:32,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you,Mr. Blake,for staying for this other film,

1156
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:34,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which is also a masterpiece.

1157
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:36,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of the very best

1158
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:40,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by the famous director Martin Scorsese.

1159
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:41,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen,

1160
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:43,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodfellas.

1161
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:45,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- All right,that's it. Come on. - No,we're staying.

1162
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:46,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be stupid. Come on.

1163
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:49,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll draw ten times more attention to ourselves by running out now.

1164
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:50,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're gonna wonder what we're running away from.

1165
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:53,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna spend two hours listening to you rhapsodize

1166
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:54,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about your family's home videos.

1167
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a good movie,Stan. Gangsters all over the screen,

1168
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:59,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that's gotta be a turn-on for a top cop like you.

1169
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:02,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I bet it's your favorite secret jerk-off movie.

1170
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:03,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could tell me.

1171
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:09,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna like the way it ends. I guarantee.

1172
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:18,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As far back as I can remember,I always wanted to be a gangster.

1173
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:45,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus! You scared the shit out of me!

1174
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:48,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? Going somewhere?

1175
01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:50,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I got into some trouble at school.

1176
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want the Feds blaming you guys for what I did,

1177
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:55,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I'm gonna bail out and head to Paris.

1178
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:58,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm 14,so,it's time I started out in the business.

1179
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:00,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad was 13 when he started.

1180
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,we don't have lD's or anything like that,so you can't...

1181
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think I'm some kind of amateur?

1182
01:22:09,710 --> 01:22:11,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never cease to amaze me.

1183
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:13,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1184
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:17,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Those are Mom's pearls. - Yeah.

1185
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:20,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you going?

1186
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:24,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- To be with the man that I love. - Cool.

1187
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:28,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Take care of yourself,OK? - Yeah.

1188
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:30,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come here.

1189
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:35,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I love you,you know. - I love you,too.

1190
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a...

1191
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a beautiful movie,my friends. Thank you.

1192
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:56,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,we're gonna do a little debate,

1193
01:22:56,970 --> 01:22:59,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}totally unprepared,of course,but...

1194
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK,Mr. Blake?

1195
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:06,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be careful,Fred.

1196
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,I have a question for you,Mr. Blake.

1197
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:27,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When one lives in New York,does one sense quite so vividly

1198
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:31,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the presence of the Mafia,as it is represented in movies?

1199
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh... The presence of the Mafia?

1200
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:40,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh... Might one,you know,bump into men

1201
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:43,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like the three gangsters in the movie in the street?

1202
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:46,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh... In the street?

1203
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:52,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know,there's an opening scene,

1204
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and there's a guy on the left...

1205
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:59,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...with a yellow shirt on,sitting on the chair that's turned around,

1206
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:01,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he was a real gangster.

1207
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:04,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stone-cold killer.

1208
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:07,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'd see him on Hester and Mulberry.

1209
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:13,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every morning he'd be having his coffee,just like he did when he was a kid.

1210
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:16,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His father used to beat him up,threw him out of the house.

1211
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:18,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This kid had a lot of aggression,

1212
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:24,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that's where that killer instinct comes out,

1213
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:30,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'cause you've been getting so many beatings,you just don't give a fuck.

1214
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:36,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At 12 years old this kid had,what you'd call a beef with...

1215
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:41,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...an argument with a kid from another neighborhood,

1216
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and one thing led to another,the next thing you know,

1217
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:46,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he beat him to death with a two-by-four.

1218
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:49,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Put his hand in cold water."

1219
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:53,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's an expression that certain people used to use

1220
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:55,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when you killed somebody for the first time.

1221
01:26:38,190 --> 01:26:40,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why aren't they answering it? The kids are home,aren't they?

1222
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:45,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,the lights are on in their bedrooms.

1223
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please.

1224
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:51,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's OK,Maggie's home.

1225
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:57,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please. Oh,pick up the phone.

1226
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:03,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

1227
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

1228
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:11,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check out the town,get a feel for what's going on.

1229
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:13,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gotcha.

1230
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:17,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,stop,already it's super late.

1231
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:22,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,I'm outside. No stop,really? Seriously?

1232
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:24,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on,m,Belle.

1233
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:26,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute.

1234
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:28,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow,what's wrong with the dress?

1235
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:31,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can I use your phone? - You don't lend your phone to people.

1236
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:36,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah?

1237
01:27:36,910 --> 01:27:39,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You take care of the firehouse and meet us outside the town hall.

1238
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:42,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We'll take the cops. - OK.

1239
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:50,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So,finally they get so impatient,they just shoot him,shoot him.

1240
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:53,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boom,boom,boom. Put him in the fucking tote. Bam!

1241
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:55,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This fucker's out of control.

1242
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:57,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Round up Maggie and the kids. We're gonna go into plan B tonight.

1243
01:27:57,770 --> 01:27:59,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gotcha.

1244
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:02,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's going on? - We're outta here tonight.

1245
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:09,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello? - Hi. It's Belle.

1246
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:12,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Belle. I can't really talk right now. I'm having dinner with my father.

1247
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:15,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't keep you long. I just wanted to tell you that I love you.

1248
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:17,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Belle...

1249
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And hear your voice one more time before I go.

1250
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:23,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're leaving Cholong? - Yes.

1251
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you going?

1252
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To be with you.

1253
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Belle,we've already talked about this.

1254
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:33,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For now,it's better if we just give each other some space.

1255
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of my sister's come down,we're having a big family meal.

1256
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:37,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really can't talk right now.

1257
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:51,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sir,how can I help you? - Sorry,I don't speak French.

1258
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:07,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try that.

1259
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Found it.

1260
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But,uh,I'll give you a ring in a week,

1261
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:21,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK,when I get back from Paris.

1262
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:23,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll call you back.

1263
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:08,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a question for you,young man. How many people are in this firehouse?

1264
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:11,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody,just me.

1265
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good news.

1266
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:30,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Hey,guys.

1267
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:33,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Did you guys see the kids go out? They're not in their rooms.

1268
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,they're supposed to be at home.

1269
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:37,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,yeah,well. I guess they must have snuck out.

1270
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what kids their age do,right?

1271
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:41,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maggie,do you have any idea where they could be?

1272
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:44,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I guess if you'd let them have cell phones we could find out.

1273
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:48,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maggie,look,Stan's activated the emergency plan. You're leaving tonight.

1274
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:50,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong,things went badly at the film society?

1275
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a complete disaster.

1276
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:07,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paulo and Albert at the intersection.

1277
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:10,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bernie and Tommy on the street there,watching for the Feds.

1278
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:12,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They must have a hideout with a view of the house.

1279
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:15,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mezzo,you cut off the back exit,if they try to run that way.

1280
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:19,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Billy and me,we take care of the rest. Everybody happy?

1281
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:21,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,that should do.

1282
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:23,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What time do we synchronize our watches to?

1283
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:26,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What time is it now? Who's got French time?

1284
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:29,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Me. It'll be midnight in 15 seconds. - Good.

1285
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:40,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck.

1286
01:31:40,990 --> 01:31:42,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that?

1287
01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:54,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus,the police switchboard is down.

1288
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:56,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's going on? - I don't know,but if I find out

1289
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you had anything even remotely to do with this,

1290
01:31:59,510 --> 01:32:00,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're gonna go away for a hell of a long time.

1291
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:02,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calm down. I was with you all night.

1292
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:04,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the problem. Your alibi is too good.

1293
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:11,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I forbid you to leave this house. Is that clear?

1294
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:12,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1295
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:25,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My husband's home. I'm gonna go look for the kids.

1296
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:28,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

1297
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:30,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes?

1298
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going by the police station to see what's going on.

1299
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:33,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want the whole family in the house.

1300
01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:35,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

1301
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:38,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay right here.

1302
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:48,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anybody here?

1303
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:12,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to check this block out and meet me back here in ten,all right?

1304
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:13,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got it.

1305
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:14,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bernie. - Yeah?

1306
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The Feds are here somewhere. Find them. - I will.

1307
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:25,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys,look,I just wanna pack some clothes

1308
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:29,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in case you send us to the North Pole,and I gotta find my kids.

1309
01:33:30,890 --> 01:33:33,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't be long,I promise. Five minutes.

1310
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:35,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- OK. - Five minutes.

1311
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:37,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

1312
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:31,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They're here. They've found us. - Who?

1313
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:36,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know how,but the street's crawling with them.

1314
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:40,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're here.

1315
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:43,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no number on the house.

1316
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:46,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That means that's the one. Let's go.

1317
01:35:04,650 --> 01:35:05,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1318
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:08,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a cleanup operation. Get that family out of there.

1319
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:10,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maggie's with us. The kids are unaccounted for. Only Fred's in the house.

1320
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:26,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See that,Malavita? Huh?

1321
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:33,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's up?

1322
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:58,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Happy? - very-.

1323
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:00,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wanna go out?

1324
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:28,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,my God. They're gonna blow up the house.

1325
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:30,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,my God.

1326
01:36:42,210 --> 01:36:45,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,Gio,pick up the phone. Please.

1327
01:37:03,190 --> 01:37:05,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pick up the phone.

1328
01:37:13,490 --> 01:37:15,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shh! Shh!

1329
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:23,420


1330
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:27,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maggie,be calm. Shh!

1331
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:30,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. Maggie,listen to me.

1332
01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:35,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going to go out the back,you wait a few seconds.

1333
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:39,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- On my signal,you come out. - Where are my kids?

1334
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:43,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know where your kids are,but on my signal,you come out,OK?

1335
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:45,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

1336
01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:49,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on. Let's go. - OK.

1337
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck.

1338
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:38,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's that? - Bernie.

1339
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,my God.

1340
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:18,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey,Maggie. - Hey,Bernie.

1341
01:39:19,490 --> 01:39:23,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's good to see you again. - The feeling's not mutual,Bernie.

1342
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:38,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maggie,I'd like to make it a clean kill.

1343
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:41,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After what your husband did,and you know the rule.

1344
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:44,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I have to dirty you first. - Yeah,I know.

1345
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:53,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holy shit.

1346
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:57,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:22,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maggie,if you don't put up a fight,it won't hurt so bad.

1348
01:40:25,430 --> 01:40:27,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Aw,geez. - What?

1350
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:30,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What should we do with it,Tom?

1351
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:32,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said everybody and no witnesses,right?

1352
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:34,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,it's not like the dog could rat on anyone.

1353
01:40:35,150 --> 01:40:37,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Just shoot the fucking mutt,Al. - He's a dog.

1354
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:39,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Albert,shoot the dog or I'm gonna shoot you.

1355
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:42,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right,relax,put the fucking gun down,Tommy. OK?

1356

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll shoot the fucking dog.

1357

1362
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:23,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This morning,I was worth $20 million.

1363
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:25,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm probably worth double that now.

1364
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:29,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've cheated death so many times in my life,I don't even think about it anymore.

1365
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:32,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like getting caught outside in a storm.

1366
01:44:32,220 --> 01:44:34,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just have to avoid being hit by the lightning.

1367
01:44:35,010 --> 01:44:37,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But all things considered,I had a pretty good day.

1368
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:40,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My family is more together than we've ever been,

1369

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the water in town ain't brown no more,

1370
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:46,530

1371

1372
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,780

1373
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:54,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is that I have to re-write this entire fucking book.
