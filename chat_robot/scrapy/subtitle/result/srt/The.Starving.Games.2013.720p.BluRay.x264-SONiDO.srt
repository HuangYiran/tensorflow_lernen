1
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,770
挨饿游戏

2
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,830
嗨 凯迷思！
Hey, Kantmiss!

3
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,970
我的伟大 和强大的
I am the great
and powerful--

4
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,370
啊哈！
Aah!

5
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,730
戴尔！
Dale!

6
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,000
只是想 给你个惊喜
Just wanted
to surprise you.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,270
你让我错失了我的猎物
You made me miss my shot.

8
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,670
嗷
Ow.

9
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,410
狗杂种！
我的背啊！
Son of a bitch!
My back!

10
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,380
看看我得到了什么
Look what I got.

11
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,290
那玩意是真的吗？
Is it real?

12
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,720
哦！ 
想想看！
Ohh!
Psych!

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,960
是块令人作呕的面包！
It's gag bread!

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
看着你
Look at you.

15
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,460
好吧
Right.

16
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,600
你知道...
You know...

17
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,100
我们可以离开这里
we could run away
from here.

18
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,000
我们可以找到别的地方住
We could live
someplace else.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,300
像在哪里？
Like where?

20
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,440
任何地方 只要比这地方好就行
Anywhere that's
better than here.

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,910
达尔富尔 叙利亚
Darfur. Syria.

22
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,280
纽泽西州
New Jersey.

23
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,080
戴尔 那真的很浪漫并且...
Dale, that's--that's
romantic and all...

24
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,720
但我没办法离开我的妹妹
but I can't leave
my sister.

25
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,250
我也不能离开
I can't leave either.

26
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,220
亲爱的年老奶奶等着我照顾她
My dear, old grandma
depends on me to feed her.

27
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,560
天啊 我永远没有我自己的孩子
God, I am never
having kids.

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,360
我的意思是你如何养育一个孩子
I mean, how can
you raise a child

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,930
在这一个他监看着的地方
in a world
where they televise

30
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,400
人间各种悲剧 然后转眼忘记
all of life's misery and
inhumanity and then pass it off

31
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,640
最为变态的一种娱乐
as some sort of twisted
entertainment?

32
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,870
“挨饿游戏”
"The Hunger Games."

33
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,240
成年礼和怀孕
"16 and Pregnant."

34
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,880
早安
Good morning,

35
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,580
十二区的饥饿公民们
hungry citizens
of District 12.

36
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,250
今天的新闻是 我们仍然没有食物
In today's news,
we still have no food,

37
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,080
天气跟大便一样糟
and the weather
will be shitty.

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,180
哦 还有别忘了
Oh, and don't forget,

39
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,650
今天是抽签仪式
today is
the Gathering Ceremony,

40
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,250
因此各位家长请把你们心爱的孩子带来
so, parents, please bring
your beloved children

41
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,920
广场 来一次死亡乐透
to the square
for a random death lottery.

42
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,190
谢谢
Thank you.

43
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,400
我听说有些孩子 太害怕
I heard that some kids
are so afraid

44
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,760
被选上
of getting picked
for the Games

45
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,930
所以试着采取一些丧失资格的手段
that they'll actually
try to get disqualified

46
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,800
造成伤害或自残
by injuring or
maiming themselves.

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,370
那只是个传说吧
That's an urban legend.

48
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,510
呃！
Uhh!

49
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,720
排好队
Get in line.

50
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,830
哦 别这样
贱人
Oh, come on,
bitch.

51
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,840
因此事实
Ipso facto p--

52
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,580
你的行动特权 已经没有了
Your movie franchise
is over.

53
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,780
回去排队
Get back in line.

54
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,810
回去排队
Get back in line.

55
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,710
嗜血的家伙
Bloody dick.

56
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,520
哎 别说话
Hey, no talking.

57
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,850
继续前进
Keep it moving.

58
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,990
我得去找我的妹妹
I gotta find my sister.

59
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,190
祝你好运
Good luck.

60
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,500
佩图妮
凯迷思
Petunia.
Kantmiss.

61
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:48,930
嘿 老妈
Hey, Mom.

62
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,210
我好害怕 凯迷思 人家怕怕
I'm scared, Kantmiss.
I'm scared.

63
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,570
嘿 嘿 不要怕 我给你带来这个
Hey, hey, don't be.
I got you this.

64
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,440
这是最勇敢的鸟 上面还有...
It's the most courageous bird
that there is...

65
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,010
一只鸡
a chicken.

66
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,080
当你带着它 
没什么不好的事会发生在你身上
When you wear this,
nothing bad can happen to you.

67
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,250
嘘嘘 
不 不要哭了
Shh. Shh.
No, don't cry.

68
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,020
你会没事的 好吗
You're gonna
be fine, okay?

69
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,720
我保证
I promise.

70
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,360
继续前进
Keep moving.

71
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,600
排好队！
Line up!

72
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,640
男左女右！
Girls on the right.
Boys on the left!

73
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,480
欢迎来到第75届 挨饿游戏
Welcome to the 75th annual
Starving Games.

74
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,650
哦 哦！哦！
Oh. Oh! Ohh!

75
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,390
嘿 哦！
Hey.
Ohh!

76
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,260
那是 我的香肠！
But that was my sausage!

77
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,330
从我们尊敬的领袖传来一段视讯
And now a video
from our esteemed leader,

78
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,170
雪球总统
President Snowballs.

79
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,410
他曾经杀死他的老母......
He once killed
his own mother...

80
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,980
因为她忘了切掉三明治外面面包的皮
because she forgot to cut
the crust off his PB&J.

81
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,990
他唯一的脸书好朋友 
是梅尔·吉布逊
His only Facebook friend
is Mel Gibson.

82
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,360
他有一个自己的部落格
He has an online blog

83
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,890
在上面泄漏电影的结局
that gives away
the endings of movies

84
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,160
上面没有声明 “狗仔警告 ”
without ever using the
disclaimer "spoiler alert."

85
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,730
什么 
他就是...
What?
He is...

86
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,930
世界上最可怕的人
the most terrible man
in the world.

87
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,370
我不是很喜欢啤酒的
I don't always like beer,

88
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,970
但是如果我想要 
我选择特雷斯·一块死
but when I want one,
I choose Tres Equis.

89
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,010
味道有点像尿一样
Tastes like piss water.

90
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,080
啊哈！
Aah!

91
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,020
每一年 我都会让你们观看此视讯
Every year, I make you
watch this video,

92
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,290
因为 你都是傻瓜
because, well,
you're dumb.

93
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,260
人们忘记在过去
People forget
how in the past

94
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,530
狗屎真的击中了风扇
shit really hit the fan.

95
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,130
组织太大了
并且人们开始失去信心
Corporations got too big,
and people lost trust.

96
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,430
他们静坐罢工 聚众闹事
They staged sit-ins.
They rioted.

97
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,100
你选出女神卡卡作为总统
You elected Lady Gaga
as President

98
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,940
和她的竞选搭档 妮奇·米娜
and her running mate
Nicki Minaj.

99
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,970
这就是为什么我们穿
这些稀奇古怪的衣服吧
That's why we wear
these kooky clothes now

100
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,710
和怪异的发型
and have bizarre hairdos.

101
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,650
后来我接手
Then I took over

102
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,210
把国家分成各区域
and separated the country
into districts

103
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,050
所以那些愚蠢的行为 
永远不会再发生
so that stupid shit
never happened again.

104
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,750
啊哈！
Aah!

105
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,890
已经证明 民主没有用
You've proven that democracy
doesn't work,

106
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,190
在这里以我的第六感来看
and I'm here, in my sixth
self-proclaimed term,

107
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,430
保证所有的自由意志都不见
to ensure that all free will
is expunged,

108
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,560
别再把那丑陋的头像放上去
never to rear
its ugly head again.

109
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,040
是的 自从那后导致我们今天的情况
Yes, that brings us to today.

110
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,210
只是为了证明我是一个很屌的人
Just to prove what
a sick, sadistic prick I am

111
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,780
你们是如此无能为力
and how you have
no control...

112
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,810
自从看过 阿诺的“过关斩将”
and admittedly after
watching "The Running Man"

113
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,850
和日本变态片“大逃杀”
and the Japanese
cult hit "Battle Royale,"

114
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,350
我想出了 挨饿游戏
I came up with
the Starving Games.

115
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,790
从各地区挑选两个孩子
Two kids from each district
are selected

116
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,620
玩死亡游戏 只有一个幸存者
to play a game to the death
with only one survivor.

117
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,060
赢家能获得丰富奖金
The winner is to be
showered with a bounty,

118
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,530
包括一只老火腿...
including an old ham...

119
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,030
哦 我超爱老火腿
Oh, I love old ham.

120
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,430
凭此券到地铁速食店
this coupon to Subway--

121
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,930
购买任何东西可以打六折
buy any foot-long
for a six-inch price--

122
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,000
和...
and...

123
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,710
一个被吃过一部份的酸黄瓜
a partially eaten pickle.

124
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,280
最后祝玩 挨饿游戏愉快
So happy Starving Games,

125
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,450
祝你永远好运
and may the odds be
never in your favor.

126
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,450
雪球总统出品
A President Snowballs
production.

127
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,760
现在开始选出参加者！咳咳
Now let the gathering
begin! Ahem.

128
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,680
休·杰那斯
Hugh Janus.

129
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,010
嗯
Hmm?

130
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,920
不在吗 嗯 好的
No? Yeah. All right.

131
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,190
我再重抽一个 嘿
I'll pick again. Heh.

132
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,260
菲尔·穆特思(谐音似塞满女性器官)
Phil Mahooters.

133
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,530
请上来菲尔·穆特思
Please, Phil Mahooters?

134
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,470
狄恩·格布瑞(音似性无能)
Dean Gullberry.

135
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,400
看看身后
Everyone look around.

136
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,570
四处找一下 狄恩·格布瑞
Check behind you
for a Dean Gullberry.

137
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,450
这是全国直播！
This is being televised
around the country!

138
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,850
你们不要笑的太早
You won't be laughing

139
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,220
当你们当中两个被抽出并丢进屠宰场
when two of you are picked
and thrown into the arena

211
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,960
你愿意卖自己 跟妓女一样
Your willingness to sell
out and whore yourself

212
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
是我让你当上头不程式员的主要因素
is the primary reason I
made you head programmer.

213
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,100

没有人在意给份狗屎的
and no one really
seems to give a shit.

217
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,540
挨饿游戏
And the Starving Games?

218
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,810
那将是一个超棒的演出

我真的别无选择
I really had no choice.

228
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,630
名人一起挨饿游戏 是一个很烂的主意
"Celebrity Starving
Games" was a lousy idea.

229

没有人会参加的
No one
could have anticipated

230
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,360
因为欧普拉会吃掉其他选手
that Oprah would eat
all the other contestants.

231
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,370
我希望这个游戏结束能功德圆满

inspiring revolt which will not
only overthrows my presidency,

a new gardener.

当你们开始对他们有所感动
Then, when you're emotionally
attached to them,

250
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,590
我们会把他们送去恐怖的大屠杀
we'll send them off
to their horrific slaughter.

a little bummed out,

331
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,480
但是并不阻止 我们三个寻找快乐
but that doesn't stop the three of
us from having a whole lot of fun.

332
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,220

425
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,990
西丽 更血腥些
Siri, more blood.

426
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,190
哦
Oh.

427
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,430

Much better.

428
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,480
哦！ 哦！
Ooh!
Ooh!

429
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,990
是马哥！呀！
Yeah, Marco! Yeah!

430
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,400
放手！
Let go!

431
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,600
我先来的！
I got here first!

432
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,340
啊！ 现在把它给我！
Yaah!
Now give it to me!

433
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,680
我不会轻易放手的
No. I'm not letting go.

434
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,240
你背后中镖！
There is a dagger
in your back!

435
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,910
我没事！
I'm okay!

436
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,920
什么
What?

437
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,220
没事
It's fine.

438
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,620
没事
It's fine?

439
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,390
这样没事 你不放手
Seriously?
You're not letting go?

440
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,690
我要这个背包！
I want this backpack!

441
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,300
我要这个背包！
I want this backpack!

442
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,770
我要它 它是我的！
I want it. It's mine!

443
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,080
我不会轻易放手！
I'm not letting go!

444
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,850
那是我的背包！
That was my backpack!

445
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,560
那是什么声音
What was that sound?

446
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,990
大炮的声音 他们发射的
It's the cannon.
They shoot it off

447
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,460
每当有人死了 他们就发射一发
to announce whenever
someone is killed.

448
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,760
很好 看来我的胜算
Nice.
Looks like the odds

449
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,260
对我来说多一些
just got better
for me, then.

450
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,970
我的蛋蛋！
My balls!

451
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,140
哦！看来很痛
Oh! That has
got to hurt.

452
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,610
让我们来看看慢动作重播
Let's see
an instant replay.

453
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,870
我的蛋蛋！
My balls!

454
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,910
我的蛋蛋！
My balls!

455
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,050
我的蛋蛋！
My balls!

456
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,520
我的蛋蛋
My ball--

457
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,420
我的蛋蛋 我 我的蛋
My ball--
My--My ball--

458
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,790
我的蛋
My ball--

459
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:22,120
我的蛋！
My balls!

460
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,590
这样会让我起笑 鲍伯
That makes me
laugh, Bob.

461
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,060
离我远点！
Get away from me!

462
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,570
哇！
Wow!

463
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,870
这个女孩是谁
Who is this girl?

464
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,540
她来自什么区
What district
is she from?

465
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:18,110
我站在杂碎的十二区
I'm standing here
in scummy District 12,

466
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,420
那里的人们 不敢相信 彼得和凯迷思的
where people can't believe
that Peter and Kantmiss

467
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,820
可以存活过开幕式
have actually survived
the opening.

468
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,850
你可以看到大家都兴奋高亢
You can see
the excitement is high,

469
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,260
很长一段时间这个区域都没有赢过
as no one from this district
has won in a very long time.

470
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,490
呀！ 啊！
Yeah!
Unh!

471
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
加油 凯迷思！喔！
Go, Kantmiss! Whoo!

472
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,560
这是我的马子！
That's my girl!

473
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,730
这是我的马子！
That's my girl!

474
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,400
呀！
Yeah!

475
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,470
转回转播台
Back to you
in the studio.

476
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,970
我上电视了！
I'm on TV!

477
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,470
谢谢 尸躺立
Thanks, Stanley.

478
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,740
现在比数如何 砍刀
And how's the scoreboard
looking, Cleaver?

479
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,910
很多人已死
Got a lot
of people dead.

480
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,410
尽管如此 还有很多人活着
Still,
lot of people alive.

481
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,850
让我突然眼睛一亮
Enlightening.

482
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,320
哦 看来凯迷思的以他的方式
Oh, looks like Kantmiss
is making her way

483
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,190
来到屠宰场的边缘
to the outer edge
of the arena.

484
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,320
西丽 让她慢下来
Siri, slow her down.

485
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,130
噢
Ow.

486
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,970
现在 让我们的凯迷思 回到场中央
Now let's get Kantmiss back
to the center of the action.

487
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,100
呼啦！
Holla!

488
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,570
释放惊心动魄的音效
And cue the thrilling
action music.

489
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,440
哦
Ooh.

490
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,270
嗯
Hmm.

491
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,130
你想要玩玩那就来
Oh, you want to play, huh? Okay.

492
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,400
西丽
Siri.

493
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
耶 你需要什么
Yeah, what you need?

494
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,430
以最新的攻击她
Attack her
with the latest

495
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,000
用我们最先进武器
technological weaponry
we have.

496
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,440
喔 哈！
Whoo-hah!

497
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,570
噢 该死！
Oh, shit!

00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,440

No.

501
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,940
怎么怎么
What? What?

502
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,280
很高兴看到我柳丁吗
Orange you glad
to see me?

503
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,050
嘿 嘿 嘿！
Hey, hey, hey!

504
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,280
当你以一个黄色眼神你会得到什么
What do you get
when you cross an orange

505
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,880
昆汀 塔沦落(色情片导演)
with Quentin Tarantino?

506
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,620
“色情小说” 你会得到什么呢
"Pulp Fiction."
You get it?

507
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,220
果浆
Pulp.

508
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,660
嘿 凯迷思
Hey, Kantmiss,

509
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,130
我最后一次见到小笼包
last time I saw
tits that small,

510
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,290
是我看到一对金橘的时候
I was staring
at a pair of kumquats.

511
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,200
啊哈！
Aah!

512
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,700
加油 凯迷思！
Go, Kantmiss!

513
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,210
哦
Ooh,

514
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,510
她肯定会说 哟'对不起踢爆你屁股！
she sure showed
yo' sorry ass up!

515
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,750
你 你 闭嘴 西丽 你闭嘴！
You--You shut up, Siri.
You shut up!

516
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,950
妈的 不要恨 玩家
Shit. Don't hate
the player.

517
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,150
你 恨这游戏！
You--
Hate the game!

518
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:44,690
哇！我从来没有见过 有人这样做
Wow! I've never seen
anyone do that before.

519
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,520
她坏蛋
She's badass.

520
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,760
我顶
Respect.

521
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,790
让我想起了跟自己一点点像
Reminds me
a little bit of myself.

522
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,160
在我有过多的情绪前 我要停下来
I'll stop now before
I get too emotional.

523
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,130
尝尝老娘的屁！
Eat my ass!

524
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,270
你认为你很神勇吗
Think you're so tough?

525
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,140
看看你能不能搞定这 贱人！
Well, come back
from this, bitch!

526
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,090
嘿 朋友们 加油！ 
我们走这条路！
Hey, guys, come on!

527
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,860
来吧 快点！

528
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,060
走吧！
Let's go!

529
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,480
当我发现她的时候
 她就是我的
When I see her,
she's mine.

530
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,460
她肯定在这里的某个地方
She's gotta be
around here somewhere.

531
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,610
你确定凯迷思 走这条路
You sure Kantmiss
came this way?

532
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,140
嗯 我知道
Uh, I know it.

533
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,540
你怎么能这么肯定 
我们可以信任你吗
How can we be so sure
that we can trust you?

534
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,310
我的意思是 
你是自愿参加这游戏的
I mean, didn't you volunteer
to be in the games

535
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,750
只是为了接近凯迷思的
just so you can get
closer to Kantmiss?

536
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,080
不
No.

537
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,050
我的意思是 也许一开始是
I mean, maybe at first,

538
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,690
但我不再喜欢她了
but I don't
like her anymore.

539
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,750
真的吗
Really?

540
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,760
嗯 你知道
Well, you know,

541
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,160
早在12区时
back in District 12,
she's--

542
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,190
她的作为相当是妓女
she's known
as quite the whore.

543
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
啊
Ahh.

544
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,530
她在那里
There.

545
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,530
嘿
Heh.

546
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,200
做得好 彼得

谢谢
Thanks.

548
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,110
我会打爆她的肠子
I'm gonna bust her gut
wide open.

549
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,080
这个小公主 全部是我的
This little princess
is all mine.

550
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:52,480
啊！
Raah!

551
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,750
凯迷思在那！
And there's Kantmiss!

552
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,960
哦 我们会杀了你
Oh, no.
We're gonna kill you.

553
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,120
在我们吃 我们的美味佳肴
Right after we eat
our delicious treats.

554
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,460
咦
Huh?

555
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,970
你怎么能 与他们搅和在一起
How can you
be with them?

556
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,500
我不知道
I don't know.

557
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,070
我...
I--I guess I just...

558
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,940
真的很喜欢他们
really like them.

559
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,440
它们太酷了 而广受欢迎
Th-They're so cool
and popular.

560
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,380
我的意思是 
我是高中的艾薇俱乐部
I mean, I'm in
the high school A/V club.

561
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,580
我从来没有机会与痞子们一起玩
I've never been able to hang
with the in crowd before.

562
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,280
嗯 
跟我们在一起
Mmm.
Stay with us.

563
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,290
太好了

989
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:01,690
你知道...
You know...

990
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:04,160
我暗恋你很久了
I've had a crush on you
for the longest time.

991
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,460
每天放学 我曾经跟着你回家
I used to follow you home
from school every day.

992
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,630
每天
Every day.

993
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:14,830
我还记得 当你
And I remember
when you got

994
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,900
八岁生日拿到第一件有穿衣服的洋娃娃
your first dress-up dolly
on your eighth birthday.

995
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,110
而当你十二岁时
And when you turned 12

996
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:23,840
你的第一个MC来了
and got your first period.

997
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:28,950
每天晚上我看着你洗澡
I watched you shower
every night,

998
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:30,780
洗后
and after you got out,

999
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:33,150
我会在排水口收集你的头发
I would pick through the
drain and collect your hair.

1000
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,160
什么
What?

1001
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,490
你给我做一毛公仔呢
You made
a hair doll of me?

1002
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,160
不只一个
Not just one.

1003
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:45,470
哦
Ohh.

1004
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:49,300
这是你和我
That's you and me,

1005
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,010
而这些都是我们的六个孩子
and those are our six kids.

1006
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,510
那是谁
And who's that?

1007
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:55,980
这就是我们的小狗 阿飞
That's our puppy, Alphie.

1008
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,510
汪汪！
Woof woof!

1009
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,050
汪！ 恶
Woof!
Eww.

1010
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,280
她是里面最小的
She's the runt
of the litter,

1011
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:05,750
但我们爱她 都是一样的
but we love her
all the same.

1012
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,460
哦
Ohh.

1013
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,220
啊 你有一个毛茸茸的小妞
Ah, you got
a hairy chick, dude.

1014
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,200
我太饿了
I'm so hungry.

1015
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,130
可怜的宝贝
Poor baby.

1016
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,620
这是什么 浓汤！
Soup!
What?

1017
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:46,230
肯定 让你感到更好
That'll definitely
make you feel better.

1018
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,160
嗯
Hmm?

1019
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,100
这是什么
What?

1020
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,910
我想他们要我们 更浪漫一些
I--I think that they want
us to be more romantic,

1021
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:08,410
并且作为回报 他们会送
我们的一些东西 让你好更快
and, in return, they'll send
us stuff to make you better.

1022
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,650
听起来不错
Sounds good to me.

1023
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:36,040
对不起 戴尔
Sorry, Dale.

1024
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,880

What?!

1025
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,010

Really?

1026
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:44,050
哦 哦 来吧
Ooh.
Oh, come on.

1027
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:45,650

Hey, who thinks
they're gonna do it?

1028
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:46,650
我们要看！ 我们要看！

现在要干吗(纸条:快表演精彩的)
What is it now?

1031
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,410
这是对的！
All right!

1032
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:11,540
彼得 我不知道我能不能做到这一点
Peter, I don't know
if I can do this.

1033
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:15,050
哦 我的背部
Oh, my back.

1034

I don't know how much
longer I can hang on.

1036
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,790

All right. Let's...

1037

给他们想要的
give them
what they want.

1038
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:42,240
太棒了
Fantastic.

你不能用力捏我的屁股
Can you not grab
my butt so hard?

1042
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:57,920
我没有捏你的屁股
I'm not touching
your butt at all.

1043
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:58,760
哦！

不要害怕
Do not be afraid.

1045
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:02,560
我只是 一位慈祥的老巫师
I am but
a kindly old wizard.

1046
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,060
把手移开我的屁股！
Get your hand
off my ass!

1047
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,130
好吧 嗯......
Right. Well...

1048
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:05,930
让我解释一下
let me explain.

1049
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:08,230
你看 我们正在旅行
You see,
we were traveling.

1050

We were on--

We were on our way

1052
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:13,010
迷雾

迷雾山 是的
the Misty
Mountains, yes.

1054
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,810
我们听到了呻吟声
And then
we heard a moan

1055
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:18,580
来自 这个洞穴里面
coming from
inside this cave,

1056
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,710
担心这是惨叫的呻吟
and fearing it to be
a moan of distress

1057
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,380
做为好心的矮人
and being the good
Samaritans that we are,

1058
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:25,520
我们来到这里 帮助你

What if we don't give
'em the satisfaction?

1180
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:44,420
如果我们都自杀
What if we
both kill ourselves

1181
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:46,460
