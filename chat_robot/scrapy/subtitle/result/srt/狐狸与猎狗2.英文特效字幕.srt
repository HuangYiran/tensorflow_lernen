235
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What do you think you're doin'? - Little audience participation.

236
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,030

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- could ever take my place in the band? - I didn't say that.

244
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:15,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Although, he does have that refreshin' bloom of youth about him.

245
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Just what exactly are you sayin'? - What do you think I'm sayin'?

246
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Better not be sayin' what I think. - You know what I'm sayin'.

247
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You better know what you're sayin' isn't what I think.

248
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why do you always have to... - 'Cause you never...

249
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,030

256
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,270

324
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The nerve of that Cash. Where does he get off firin' me?

325
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I thought you quit.

326
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm that band's heart and soul.

327
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's plain as a pig on a sofa.

328
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bet Cash can talk a dog off a meat truck.

329
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He talked me into gettin' sweet on him

330
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now he tosses me away like yesterday's cornbread.

331
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, I don't blame you for feeling hurt.

332
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurt? What do you mean by that?

333
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think Cash could hurt me?

334
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,590


335
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mangy mutt.

336
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, y'all howled real good today, fellers.

337
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, well.

338
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's more than one way to skin a cat.

339
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No offence.

340
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Soup's on!

341
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's a good boy, right there.

342
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, fellas. All right. Bon appetit.

343
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:06,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, if I could just play the banjo better, y'all would be eatin' steaks.

344
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I guess I'd better go practice.

345
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to the band, kid. Let me do some introductions.

346
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That there is Waylon and Floyd.

347
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're the brains of the outfit.

348
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why I put up with this low class crew of mutts is beyond me.

349
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that delicate flower is Granny Rose.

350
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Textbook version of growin' old gracefully.

351
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I got me an itch.

352
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:39,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep, you'll never harmonize with a finer group of singin' strays than...

353
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are a stray, right boy?

354
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Course he's a stray. You don't see a collar on him, do ya?

355
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- True enough. - I don't see one.

356
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No collar, no home.

357
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Only strays allowed in this dog's band.

358
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tod, I'm not a stray.

359
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll be our secret.

360
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chief, just wait till Copper sees this.

361
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,580
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Another fourth place ribbon.

362
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next year, we're goin' for the three-peat.

363
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh. Oh, my... - What the...?

364
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Widow Tweed? - Huh?

365
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you make a career out of gettin' in my way?

366
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Step aside woman, I got a prize winner comin' through.

367
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, so do I. - What?

368
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This here's a huntin' dog. What could you do with a pie?

369
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woman's got spunk. I'll give her that.

370
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, fellers, ten minutes to curtain.

371
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's round 'em up and move 'em out.

372
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,300
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Move 'em round. - I'm movin'.

373
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That means you, Copper. - Huh?

374
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good luck, Copper. - Thanks, entourage.

375
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say, Tod, while we're on, why don't you spiff up those bowls a bit?

376
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The bowls?

377
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, Cash.

378
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't forget. Fireworks, smack at sundown.

379
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a promise.

380
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little darlin'.

381
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on in. Dixie wants to talk to ya.

382
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, I'm supposed to sing now.

383
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I know. I just wanna pass along my secret of success.

384
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? Thanks Miss Dixie.

385
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before every show, take a big ol' helpin' of that.

386
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Peanut butter?

387
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Let's get to growlin' and howlin'.

388
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now... Granny Rose, go fetch Copper, will you?

389
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang on. Oh, that's good.

390
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me, me, me, me, me

391
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woof, woof, woof, woof

392
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh-oh. Bad news in a rhinestone collar.

393
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cash, you look nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rockin' chairs.

394
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause I'm busy as a farmer with one hoe and two rattlesnakes.

395
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah? Well I'm as...

396
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, I got nothin'. - What is it, Dixie?

397
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just thought you could use a lead singer.

398
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,190


399
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Peanut butter?

400
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Copper, you have to sing.

401
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on, Copper. I'll be right back.

402
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,870


403
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The winner of the milkin' contest is...

404
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the widow Tweed and her fine cow, Abigail.

405
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

406
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Copper, come on out.

407
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perfect, just like that.

408
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

409
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You know darn well Copper is our... - Copper? You mean that little pup?

410
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, he ran off with that fox friend of his

411
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Iike a bank robber on roller skates.

412
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're kiddin'.

413
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, if I'm lyin', may my fur lose its natural lustre.

414
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That did it. I can sing.

415
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. Now when you get out there, don't forget to...

416
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, see you at the fireworks, right?

417
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get used to it, entourage.

418
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is how it's gonna be from now on.

419
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean?

420
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}While he's off havin' fun and gettin' the glory,

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he'll stick you back here with the chores.

422
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Copper isn't like that.

423
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

424
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we'll see, won't we?

425
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here I am.

426
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ran off, huh?

427
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, Dix.

428
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Peanut butter? Oh, Dixie.

429
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are through.

430
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, gettin' rid of me ain't gonna be so easy, Cash.

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All that he can think about is fortune and fame

539
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There ain 't nothin ' I can do To turn his head and excite him

540
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes I swear I just wanna bite him

541
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's lonely at the top

542
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,110
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When the lights go down and the cheerin ' stops

543
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got no real friends

544
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No place to call home

545
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all, good doggie

546
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good doggie

547
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all, good doggie

548
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No bone

549
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, no, no

550
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good doggie

551
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No bone

552
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:24,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good doggie, no bone

553
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good doggie

554
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No bone

555
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:44,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good doggie, no bone

556
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good doggie, no bone Not even a little bitty bone

557
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good doggie

558
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:58,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No bone

559
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now that's a good little doggie.

560
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, you know what?

561
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wouldn't even be in that dumb ol' band if I hadn't lied for him.

562
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come again.

563
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got Cash to think he was a stray.

564
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Copper's no stray. He lives just down the road a piece.

565
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little darlin', all our troubles are over.

566
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd you like to get your best friend back?

567
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But how?

568
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just listen close to ol' Dixie here.

569
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now we can strut our stuff

570
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}While the fans all howl and scream

571
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,460
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, no. That last note was flatter than a duck's footprint.

572
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take it from the top, please.

573
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, but Cash, we've been at it all night.

574
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we'll be at it all day if that's what it takes.

575
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This ain't just another show.

576
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The scout from the Grand Ole Opry is gonna be watchin'.

577
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take it from the top.

578
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Copper, just what are you doin'? - Well, it's a cricket.

579
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Me and Tod used to... - What is the matter with you, kid?

580
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't you wanna be a star? - Well, sure.

581
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, then, why don't you act... - Cash, he's just a pup.

582
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Copper's just havin' a little fun.

583
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do remember fun, don't you?

584
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, all right.

585
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just take five, everyone.

586
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetie pie, don't take it to heart.

587
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cash's bark is worse than his bite.

588
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if he growls at us again, I'm gonna muzzle him, myself.

589
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tod?

590
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tod?

591
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You in there?

592
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cash, have you seen Tod?

593
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nope. Dixie ain't around, neither.

594
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were looking for her?

595
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

596
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

597
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember when I first met her.

598
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just a little ol' stray like you, all paws and ears and...

599
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Felt like a real good-for-nothin'.

600
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You? - Yeah.

601
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then one night, we went a-howlin' at the moon

602
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I found out we could sing.

603
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I said, "Dixie, this is our ticket to success.

604
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,030
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are gonna be stars."

605
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I'd be stretchin' if I said I didn't want her around sometimes.

606
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we're a couple of hound dudes now, remember?

607
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't let old friends get in the way of that, right?

608
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess not.

609
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, come on. You're havin' fun, ain't you?

610
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kiddin'?

611
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you just wait till we're on top.

612
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are so close I can smell it.

613
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Grand Ole Opry.

614
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All we gotta do is ace that audition.

615
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Right? - Right.

616
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on, let's go rehearse some more. - Attaboy.

617
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Copper.

618
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Copper!

619
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, where could that pup have gotten off to?

620
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Copper!

621
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tod? Oh, Tod?

622
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Widow, what are you doin' up this time of night?

623
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I can't find my Tod anywhere.

624
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That pup of yours probably chased him off.

625
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't know. I can't find him.

626
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

627
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I see a sign of your puppy, I'll give you a holler.

628
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm obliged.

629
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I see hide or hair of that fox of yours...

630
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

631
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Amos.

632
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tod.

633
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, Tod. - Copper.

634
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tod.

635
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my...

636
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my hair.

637
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Broke a nail.

638
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's where Copper lives.

639
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice spread. Could use a woman's touch.

640
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure this is a good idea?

641
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the only way.

642
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When Clem Clodkicker over there gets to the fair and sees Copper,

643
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he'll bring him home for sure. You two get to be friends again.

644
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,510
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'll reclaim my rightful place in the spotlight.
