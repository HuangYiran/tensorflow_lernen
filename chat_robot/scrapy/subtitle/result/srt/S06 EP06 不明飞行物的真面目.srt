00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,380
天地伊始  一片混沌
In the beginning, there was darkness.

10
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,880
忽地一声巨响  
And then-- Bang!

11
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,640
时空与物质由此而生
Giving birth to an endless, expanding existence

12
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,980
继而不断发展  永无止尽
of time, space, and matter.

13
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,220
每天都有新发现解开其中
Every day, new discoveries are unlocking

14
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,750
神秘莫测  令人大开眼界  却又致命的秘密 
the mysterious, the mind-blowing, the deadly secrets

15
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,200
这就是我们的
of a place we call

16
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,900
宇宙
the universe.

17
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,100
成千上万的人声称亲眼见过不明飞行物
Thousands of witnesses have claimed to see UFOs.

18
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,180
他们对此现象的描述是惊人的相似
And their accounts are often strikingly similar.

19
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,350
坠落的飞盘  加上尸体残骸
You have a crashed saucer, but also some crashed bodies.

20
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,920
还有政府介入的掩饰行为
You have government cover-up.

21
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,650
主流科学一致认为目前证据不足
Mainstream science says the evidence just isn't there.

22
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:43,700
从不明飞行物到外星飞船是一个很大的跨越
It's a big jump between a UFO and an extraterrestrial spacecraft.

23
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,040
但如果不明飞行物的确是外星飞船
But if UFOs were really extraterrestrial craft,

24
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,470
那其中又隐藏了何种令人匪夷所思的技术
what kind of mind-bending technologies would we find under the hood?

25
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,640
外星飞船一定要有特殊技术
You'd have to have some sort of technology that was capable

26
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,510
才能抵消惯性作用
of canceling the effects of inertia.

27
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,850
不明飞行物神秘面纱后的
When it comes to Unidentified Flying Objects,

28
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,240
真实面目究竟是什么呢
what is the real deal?

29
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,420
对于无数追随者来说  
For millions of believers,

30
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,680
这一切始于1947年6月24日
it all began on June 24, 1947.

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,660
商人飞行员肯尼斯・阿诺德当时正在 
A businessman and pilot named Kenneth Arnold is flying solo

32
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,780
华盛顿州的雷尼尔山附近独自飞行
near Mount Rainier, Washington.

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,350
突然  他看到九个飞行器组成一队  
Suddenly he sees a group of nine aircraft

34
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,670
以惊人的速度飞行
moving at incredible speeds.

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,650
这些飞行器高度反光
They were highly reflective,

36
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,520
并以超音速列队飞行 
and they were flying at supersonic speeds,

37
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,240
它们还会突然改变航线
in formation, changing course abruptly.

38
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,450
威廉・R・阿尔舒勒
《不明飞行物之科学》作者

39
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,730
以当时的技术无法达到该速度
The speeds were unattainable at the time.

40
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,180
那时喷气式飞机和超音速飞机还未问世
This was before the age of jets and certainly supersonic jets.

41
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,250
身为训练有素的飞行员
Being a trained pilot,

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,390
凯文・格雷瑟尔
行星学家

43
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,620
为了确认自己看到的是飞行器
he did several things to corroborate their existence

44
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,480
而不是某种大气效应
to make sure he wasn't seeing some kind of atmospheric effect.

45
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,880
他摆动自己的头  改变机身的角度
He changed his-- his head angle. He changed the aircraft angle.

46
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,090
他甚至调整了飞机位置  
He even positioned the aircraft such that

47
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,890
让白雪作为这群飞行器的背景
there was a light snow in the background behind the objects,

48
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,640
而在白雪的映衬下  这群飞行器显得很暗
and they appeared dark against a light surface.

49
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,370
但就在阿诺德设法接近时  不明物体消失了
Before Arnold can maneuver closer, the objects are gone.

50
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,930
这算得上是现代史无前例的发现
It was basically unprecedented in modern times.

51
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,960
飞碟  
肯尼斯・阿诺德 飞碟到来

52
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,700
从未有人见过类似的物体
No one had seen anything like this.

53
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,230
后来在他讲述事件时
In the days that follow, newspaper reporters misquote Arnold,

54
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,320
记者误引了阿诺德的话
as he tries to make sense of the incident.

55
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,030
当时他说它的飞行方式像碟子在水上漂
In fact, he said it moved like saucers skipping on water.

56
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,690
赛斯・肖斯塔科
地外文明搜索研究所

57
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,180
而记者把这个意思理解错了 
Now, of course, the reporter kind of messed that up

58
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,280
而报道说它们看起来像碟子
in reporting it and said that they looked like saucers.

59
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,880
"飞碟"一词由此而生
The term "Flying saucer" is born.

60
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,490
飞碟

61
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,740
阿诺德的发现首开现代不明飞行物现象的先河
And Arnold's encounter launches the modern UFO phenomenon.

62
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,210
几周后  即在1947年的夏天
Weeks later, in the summer of 1947,

63
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,180
在新墨西哥州的罗斯威尔附近发生了
perhaps the most famous incident involving an Unidentified Flying Object

64
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,200
史上最著名的不明飞行物事件
is reported near Roswell, New Mexico.

65
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,670
罗斯威尔事件是典型的不明飞行物现象
Roswell's become the poster child of the UFO phenomenon,

66
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,860
因其具备所有必要因素
because it has all the necessary ingredients.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,990
坠落的飞碟  加上尸体残骸
You have a crashed saucer, but also some crashed bodies.

68
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,840
还有政府介入  他们绝对隐瞒了实情
You have government cover-up. There was some sort of cover-up.

69
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,780
当局发布的是虚假信息
There was misinformation given out by the authorities.

70
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,010
澳大利亚空军在罗斯威尔地区牧场上空发现飞碟

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,450
消息最初是从空军那边传出的
The original account put out by the air force at the time was

72
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,700
瑞米将军否认了罗斯威尔飞碟

73
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,780
说这就是来自外太空的飞碟
that this was a flying saucer of alien origin.

74
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,540
但没过多久  这个说法就被否认了
And then later, very quickly, was denied, and the story then

75
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,370
改称这是个坠毁的气象气球
was that this was a weather balloon which had crashed and

76
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,130
发现飞碟的农场主后悔自己说出了这个事情

77
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,090
上面没有载人  
that there were no occupants on board

78
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,280
说有外星人更是无稽之谈
and that there was nothing extraterrestrial about it.

79
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,550
其他目击者宣称看到了坠毁飞行器的残片
Other witnesses claimed to have seen actual pieces of a crashed spacecraft--

80
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,010
报道称  这些材料超越了当时的科技水平
Materials that are reportedly unknown to science.

81
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,840
阿诺德的目击与罗斯威尔事件
Both Arnold's sighting and the Roswell incident remain

82
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,510
都未得到官方证实  二者本身也颇有争议
officially unconfirmed and highly controversial.

83
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,890
几乎每年都有许多关于不明物体的报道
Just about every year, there are thousands of reported sightings

84
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,020
它们多数出现在空中  
mostly in the sky,

85
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,290
便被认为是外星飞船
of objects that they assume are extraterrestrial craft--

86
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,630
即不明飞行物
So-called UFOs.

87
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,600
这个"不明"很关键  因为它们从未被确认过
The "U" is important, of course. They're unidentified.

88
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,400
我本人也曾看到一个从地平线飞起  
I personally have seen a bright light start at the horizon

89
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,260
进而直入云霄的亮点
and shoot off into the clouds.

90
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,860
严格来说这就是个不明飞行物
Now, strictly speaking, that was a UFO.

91
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:34,490
从不明飞行物到外星飞船是一个很大的跨越
It's a big jump between a UFO and an extraterrestrial spacecraft.

92
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,160
科学家认为  
Scientists argue that

93
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,230
大部分观察到的不明飞行物要么来自地球
most UFO sightings either have Earthly origins--

94
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:46,890
例如人造卫星  气球或者飞机
Like satellites, ballons, and aircraft.

95
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,260
要么来自宇宙  如陨石和彗星
Or cosmic origins, such is meteors, comets,

96
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,360
也可能是特别耀眼的  比如金星
or even the specially bright, Planet Venus

97
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,800
但当我们无法解释不明飞行物现象时
But when a UFO sighting has no known explanation,

98
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,460
它会不会就是外星飞船呢
could it be an extraterrestrial craft?

99
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,580
既然如此  究竟何种技术才能够制造出
And if so, what kind of technologies could possibly explain the behaviors

100
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,170
这些目击者所描述的现象
that witnesses actually report?

101
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,570
这些飞行器是如何制成
How would such craft be built?

102
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,500
其间又需要攻克怎样的难题
And what problems would they have to overcome?

103
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,460
报道中所述多种不明飞行物的行为
A lot of the behavior of UFOs that people have reported

104
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,520
都超出了我们目前物理学水平
are things that are beyond our current level of physics--

105
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,370
极快速率  极致加速度与急促转弯速度
Extreme rates of speed or extreme acceleration, extreme turn rates,

106
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,730
这些都是人类目前无法实现的
things that just we're-- we're not capable of doing

107
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,900
否则驾驶员甚至飞行器都要承受巨大损害
without extreme harm to a pilot or destroying a spacecraft.

108
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,090
这些目击者描述了超快的加速度
Eyewitness accounts of super fast accelerations,

109
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,210
闪电般的转向与急停  
lightning turns, and sudden stops

110
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,800
这些似乎违反了已知的物理学定律  
seem to violate known laws of physics,

111
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,990
但外星人是否已掌握毋须遵守规律的技术呢
but could aliens find a way around these laws?

112
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,840
需要强调的一条是惯性定律
So what we have to keep in mind here is the principle of inertia.

113
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,820
露丝安妮・沃克薇姿
普林斯顿大学

114
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,320
由艾萨克・牛顿首先提出 
That principle, stated first by Isaac Newton,

115
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,920
即一个处于静止或运动的物体
says that an object at rest or in motion

116
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,330
只有受外力影响才会改变其初始状态
tends to stay at rest or in motion unless acted on by an outside force.

117
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,200
因此为了适应如此剧烈的惯性变化 
So, to generate these kinds of crazy changes in inertia,

118
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,530
就需要对这些物体施加极大的外力
you'd really have to act on that object with an immense amount of force.

119
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,680
例如  一架战斗机飞行员
Following the same logic, a fighter pilot

120
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,530
以近音速的速度飞行 
traveling near the speed of sound,

121
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,360
并试图在该速度下  调转90度
attempting to make a 90-degree turn at the same speed,

122
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,630
将承受将近300G的力
would experience something close to 300 "G"S of force.

123
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,380
飞行员穿着压力服时
The most that a human pilot wearing a pressure suit

124
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,710
最多能够承受约10G的力而不至晕厥
can manage without blacking out is around ten "G"S.

125
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,260
如果它的身体构架和人类有几分相似
If his physiology were remotely similar to humans,

126
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,620
进行300G力的转向
an extraelestial pilot undergoing a 300 "G"s maneuvering

127
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,360
会立即导致死亡
would instantly perish.

128
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,570
它的内脏会继续往前运动 
His internal organs would continue moving forward

129
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,500
因撞击骨骼而碎裂
and crush against the skeleton.

130
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,700
如果它们跟人类相似
If they were similar to us,

131
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,790
就得知道如何处理液体喷撞
they'd probably have to have a way of ejecting fluid--

132
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,730
就是体内的液体  
Internal fluid-- Inside their bodies

133
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,840
这样它们就能解决
so that they dealt with

134
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,180
内脏在体内四处游动的问题 
this problem of their organs floating around inside,

135
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,940
如果能固定好内脏  加以适当的缓冲
and if they were strapped in properly and cushioned properly, uh,

136
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,490
在加速或减速时  它们的内脏就不会受损
end up not having internal damage when they accelerated and decelerated.

137
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,980
为有效抵消飞行器本身的惯性作用 
To effectively cancel the inertial effects on the craft itself,

138
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,400
这些飞行员需要利用的
the pilots might switch on a technology

139
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,630
是现代人类目前只能叹而观止的技术
that is beyond the reach of modern humans.

140
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,840
为了不受这转弯所带来的300G的影响
So, in order to cancel out the effects of a 300-g turn

141
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,870
并且不会被这巨力所压碎  
and not be squished by that amount of force,

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,560
你必须要有一种技术或装置
you'd have to have some sort of technology or a device

143
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,440
来抵消惯性作用 
that was capable of canceling the effects of inertia.

144
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,430
这个装置能够控制重力效应 
The device would have to manipulate the force of gravity,

145
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,920
运用一种力场
using a type of force field

146
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,860
抵消并控制整个宇宙的重力作用
to counteract the gravitational forces that rule the entire universe.

147
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,380
你可以根据需要
This device, you could turn on if you wanted to,

148
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,230
启动或关闭该装置
then turn it off if you wanted to,

149
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,800
或者这个装置能够自动启用和关闭
or maybe it would come on and off automatically.

150
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,940
这项技术远远超出人类的能力
This is high technology that's out of sight.

151
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,410
如果科学解释不了 
But if science can't yet explain

152
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,500
这些飞行器如何克服惯性这一关键问题
how these craft could overcome the deadly problem of inertia,

153
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,430
那飞行器的外形又是怎么一回事呢
can it help explain their shapes...

154
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,540
尤其是该如何解释这个最为出名的飞碟形状呢
Particularly the most famous shape of all, the flying saucer?

155
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:25,340
20世纪50年代末  美国空军测试了飞行车
In the late 1950s, the U.S. Air force tested the Avrocar,

156
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,210
但其设计不稳定  毫无空气动力优势 
but the design had poor stability and few aerodynamic advantages,

157
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,220
正好证明碟状飞行器 
proving that high speeds are unattainable

158
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,550
无法在地球大气层高速行进
for saucer craft in Earth's atmosphere.

159
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,000
三角翼或者楔形  都比碟形设计更稳定
The delta wing, or wedge shape, is a far stronger candidate--

160
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,400
这是现代军事飞行器设计者所熟知的事实
A fact that is well known by modern military aircraft designers.

161
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,490
事实上  目击楔形不明飞行物的报道数目
In fact, the percentage of UFO sightings reporting a wedge-shaped craft

162
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,470
在近几十年来呈逐年增长趋势
have increased in recent decades,

163
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,520
后掠翼喷气机  甚至是像蝇翅设计的
a trend that mirrors the emergence of swept-wing jets

164
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,640
B2隐形轰炸机则应运而生
and even flying-wing designs like the B-2 stealth bomber.

165
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,320
这些年来人们所报告的飞行器外形一直在改变 
The shapes that people have reported over the years have changed,

166
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,130
最近报告的形状基本都是楔形
with the most recent ones being more wedge-shaped.

167
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,510
因此  人们的描述其实反映的是
So, really, people's accounts tend to reflect

168
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,850
当时最先进的飞行器
the most advanced aircraft of the time.

169
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,270
除了运行方式和外形  
Beyond movement and shape,

170
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,450
要解开不明飞行物之谜
any attempt to explain the science of UFOs

171
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,890
还牵涉到噪音问题
has to deal with the noise factor,

172
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,100
准确地说  是它完全无噪音现象
or rather, the lack of noisy.

173
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,620
关于不明飞行物的报告均称
UFO reports consistently claim

174
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,080
这些物体在移动过程中没有发出任何声音
that the objects moved without making any sound.

175
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,740
几乎所有的目击报告中都提到
Almost all of these sightings,

176
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,630
它没有半点噪音
it's a real rule-- there's no noise,

177
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,020
但按理说  在地球大气层中
which you would expect to hear from

178
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,820
任何高速运动的飞行器都会产生噪音
any fast-moving craft in the Earth's atmosphere.

179
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,270
人们能够听见
You would hear it.

180
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,990
在实际情况中会产生音爆 
What actually happens is that you get what's called a sonic boom,

181
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,950
克利福德・强森
南加州大学

182
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,660
这是飞行器高速飞行时 
and that's a special pressure wave that

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,030
穿过大气所产生的特殊压力波
sweeps through the atmosphere along with the craft.

184
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,440
当人在地面上所听到  
So you're on the ground,

185
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,430
巨大音爆的产生是由于
and that huge sonic boom is the result of that pressure difference

186
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,780
飞行器在穿越大气时
between the front of the aircraft and the back of the aircraft

187
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,320
其首尾压力不同所致
as it pushes through the atmosphere.

188
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,610
外星飞行器能够设法消除超音速飞行中 
Could an alien craft somehow cancel out the enormous pressure wave

189
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,510
产生的巨大压力波吗
that supersonic flight generates?

190
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,180
答案也许就在
The answer could lie

191
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:27,310
最新一代的数码消音耳机所采用的技术中
in the technology used in the latest generation of digital noise-canceling headphones.

192
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,130
消音技术确实存在
So there is such a thing as a sound-canceling technology,

193
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,500
即选取想要消除的声音 
where you take a particular sound that you're interested in canceling

194
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,980
之后播放相反的声音  以达到抵消的效果
and kind of broadcast the negative of that sound to cancel it out.

195
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,050
据我所知  现代技术还无法
Now, I'm not aware of any technology that's capable of

196
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,160
抵消冲击波
doing that with shock waves.

197
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,410
要抵消音爆所带来的震耳欲聋的效果
Canceling out the ear-splitting, body-shaking effect of a sonic boom

198
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,400
必然需要一些先进的工程技术
would certainly require some advanced engineering skills.

199
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,230
假设静音已解决  而隐形又该如何解释
And if there is silence, what about invisibility?

200
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:02,820
一些报道称不明飞行物在天际凭空消失
Some reports claim that UFOs simply disappear into thin air.

201
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,010
现阶段正在研究的一种人类技术 
One promising human technology currently being researched

202
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,890
也许能够解释这一现象
might explain such phenomenon.

203
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:16,030
一种即将问世的技术也许可以改变物体的像
There is a technology on the horizon which might change things visually.

204
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,120
那是一种光线扭曲技术
And that is a kind of light-bending technology.

205
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,710
属于超材料的一种
As a class, they're called metamaterials.

206
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,150
热门电影中有不少展示
If you want to think about popular movies,

207
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,650
例如哈利波特电影中的隐形斗篷
think the invisibility cloak in the Harry Potter movies.

208
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:33,300
超材料依靠聚合物基质以及金和铜
Metamaterials use combinations of polymer substrates, gold, and copper

209
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:38,880
有效地扭曲物体周围的电磁波
to forcibly bend electromagnetic waves around an object.

210
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,150
光线被引导绕过物体
The light is guided around the object rather than being

211
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,300
而非反射或折射
reflected or refracted.

212
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,300
若天外来客无法到达地球
But advanced materials, stealth capability,

213
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,460
先进材料  隐形能力
and mind-bending maneuverability would all come to nothing

214
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:59,100
和超强的机动性都将是纸上谈兵
if our visitors were unable to get to Earth in the first place.

215
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,470
我认为其他文明成功来访的几率
I'd say that the chances of another civilization making it

216
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,640
是非常小的
here to visit us are pretty miniscule.

217
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,090
但如果它们真的做到了
But if they did make it,

218
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,220
那意味着它们已经解决了诸多难题
it would mean that they had solved a whole bunch of problems,

219
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,700
包括我们还无法解答的材料科学问题
including material-science problems that we don't have answers to.

220
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,770
因此他们的技术将领先我们许多 
So they'd have technology far beyond ours,

221
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,890
甚至超越了我们想象
perhaps even beyond what we've dreamt of at this point.

222
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,180
科学家推断出了一些独具匠心的技术
But scientists can imagine several ingenious technologies

223
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:29,210
可以完成这看似不可能完成的星际旅行
that could bridge the seemingly unbridgeable distance between the stars,

224
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:34,260
包括一种能量巨大的爆炸式推进
including one explosive propulsion source that's so apocalyptic,

225
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,990
可能身在数光年外的我们也能观测到
we might see them coming light years away.

226
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,850
数十年来  无数有关不明飞行物的报道
For decades, countless UFO reports have

227
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,770
从世界各个城市和乡村传来
surfaced from cities and countries around the globe.

228
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:57,140
但并非所有事件都发生在地球上
But not all UFO sightings have been reported from the surface of planet Earth.

229
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,990
2009年7月19日

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,330
美国宇航局奋进号航天飞机上的视频监视员 
viewers of a NASA video feed from the space shuttle endeavor

231
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,770
发现一碟状物体
reported seeing a disc-shaped object

232
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,450
徘徊于太空船的机械臂上方
hovering above the shuttle's mechanical arm.

233
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,860
收到图像  只有9.65公里的距离
Roger that visual, it has only six miles...

234
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,650
此类太空不明飞行物的目击事件
Space-based UFO sightings like this have purportedly happened

235
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,010
在人类航天史上时有发生
throughout the history of manned spaceflight.

236
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,690
无法断定的宇宙现象
Unspecified cosmic phenomenon,

237
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,810
是否就是
or could it suggest the possibility that

238
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,270
大型星际战舰正在银河系中航行
huge extraterrestrial starship are cruising the Milky Way galaxy?

239
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,870
星际旅行  是科幻题材的主要内容
Space travel between the stars-- It's a staple of science fiction, right?

赛斯・肖斯塔科
地外文明搜索研究所

241
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,160
晚间电视节目上能见到
You see it every night on television.

242
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,490
在电影情节中里也常出现
You see it in the movies all the time.

243
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,180
但我们真的能实现吗  有哪种物种做到了
But could we really do it, or could any species really do it?

244
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,620
星际距离非常遥远
Well, the distances between the stars are enormous-- Really enormous.

245
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,510
星际旅行并不违背物理学
Interstellar travel doesn't violate physics.

246
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,760
我们并不能排除其发生的可能性
It isn't that you can rule it out,

247
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,450
说  "它们绝对到不了这里"
and say "There's absolutely no way they can come here."

248
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,710
只是它实现的可能性微乎其微
It's just that it's very, very hard.

249
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,890
以距地球最近的半人马座阿尔法星为例
Just traveling from the Earth to Alpha Centauri,

250
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,580
它与地球的间距有4.5光年
our closest neighboring star at nearly 4 1/2 light years,

251
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,460
超过人类现有最强力火箭的射程
is beyond the reach of our most powerful rockets.

252
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,290
如果遥远星系的先进文明前来访问
If an advanced civilization were to visit us from a distant star system,

253
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,750
它们绝对不会使用化学燃料的火箭
we can pretty much rule out that they would use chemical rockets to get here.

不管阿波罗  土星五号还是航天飞机 
Despite the impressive pillar of fire and smoke that we see

256
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,900
发射时有着多么壮丽的火焰和烟雾
during Apollo, Saturn V, or shuttle launches,

257
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,280
化学火箭在太阳系中走不了多远
chemical rockets don't get you very far in a solar system.

258
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,740
作为现存航行最远的空间探测器
To give you some context for that distance,

259
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,410
发射于1977年的旅行者一号的工作是
our furthest known space probe is Voyager 1,

260
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,560
反馈星际间距的信息

262
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,520
它以每小时6.1万公里的速度
It's been flying for 34 years

263
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,640
飞行了34年
at 38,000 miles per hour,

264
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,770
而它现在才刚飞离太阳系没多久
and it's only now starting to leave our Solar System.

265
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,150
如果它的目的地是半人马座阿尔法星 
If its destination were Alpha Centauri,

266
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,730
则需要超过5.6万年的时间
it would take over 56,000 years

267
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,270
才能到达这最近的星系
to reach even the closest star system.

268
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,040
如果星际旅行可以在人的一生中完成 
To engage in interstellar missions on time frames of a human lifetime,

269
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,680
时间约为50年  
around about 50 years,

270
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,200
可以得出
we can see that

271
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,940
我们的航行速度至少要提高1,000倍
we need to increase the speed that we can travel by at least a factor of 1,000.

272
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,680
理查德・奥博塞
理论物理学家

273
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,020
科学家已证实
Scientists have determined

274
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:17,620
光速达到了令人咂舌的每秒三十万公里
that the speed of light is a mind-blowing 186,000 miles per second.

275
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,830
星际飞船若航行于星系之中
A spacecraft traveling the star systems

276
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,180
需要达到光速的相对比重
would have to reach a significant percentage of that speed

277
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,700
才可能到达最近的星系
even to reach the nearest star.

278
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,740
最大的难题就是重量
The biggest obstacle is weight.

279
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,900
化学火箭负载量极大
A chemical rocket exacts a huge weight penalty,

280
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:37,560
因为它要装载所有的能源供给
because its entire fuel supply must be carried on board.

281
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,620
经计算得出  
We can calculate that

282
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,780
仅仅是达到光速6%的
even to reach 6% of the speed of light

283
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,440
化学火箭所需燃料
using chemical rocket fuel,

284
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,270
就得超过整个宇宙的质量
you would need more rocket fuel than exists mass in the universe.

285
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,970
据此可知
So we really know that

286
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:53,350
光靠化学火箭燃料无法完成星际旅行
it's actually impossible to reach another star system using chemical rocket fuel.

287
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,540
如果外星来访已然实现
If extraterrestrial visitations are even possible,

288
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,190
它们一定解决了燃料问题
their spacecraft must solve this problem.

289
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,390
2011年  美国宇航局的D型纳米帆
In 2011, NASA's Nanosail-D

290
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,230
成为第一艘环绕地球飞行的太阳帆
became the first solar sail to orbit the Earth.

291
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,650
这块9.29平方米的超薄帆利用太阳光 
The ultra-thin 100-square-foot sail uses sunlight,

292
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,740
或是光子压力来作为推动力
or photon pressure, as a source of propulsion.

293
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,080
火箭推动不可改变的局限性在于
One of the immutable limitations of rocket propulsion

294
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,910
就是需要随火箭体携带燃料
is the fact that any rocket has to carry its fuel with it.

295
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:29,050
太阳帆则能利用自然资源的优势
A solar sail can take advantage of the naturally occurring resources,

296
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,140
即太阳发出的光量子 
namely photons emanating from the sun,

297
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,870
从而转化为太阳帆的推动力
which can be used to propel that solar sail.

298
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,350
同理  悬挂式滑翔机没有能源或引擎
Similarly, a hang glider can fly without any fuel or an engine

299
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,850
仅仅利用我们身边的自然资源 
just by taking an advantage of the natural resources we're surrounded by,

300
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,500
遵循大气流通规律  亦能成行
namely the atmosphere and the laws of aerodynamics.

301
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,650
可载生物飞船要达到足够速度
To achieve sufficient speeds to tow a spacecraft supporting life forms,

302
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:08,620
需要直径达数百公里的巨型太阳帆
the sail would have to be huge, up to hundreds of miles in diameter.

303
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,700
由于恒星产生的光子压力
And because the photon pressure from a star

304
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,660
会随着太阳帆航行渐远而减弱
would decrease the further the sail traveled,

305
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:21,340
有人设想过用高聚激光束驱动太阳帆
some have envisioned a concentrated laser beam directing energy at the sail.

306
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,370
但最终无法避免的是
Eventually and sadly,

307
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,960
所有的滑翔机在一定时段后都会降落
this hang glider and all hang gliders at some point have to land,

308
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,570
但使用高聚激光束的太阳帆
but a solar sail riding a beam of laser energy

309
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,480
在理论上可以完成星际旅行
could conceivably travel to the stars.

310
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,260
太阳帆能达到的最大速度
The max speed of a solar sail--

311
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,320
约为光速的10%
About 10% the speed of light.

312
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:55,920
最大速度  每秒三万公里

313
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,610
靠激光光子能量从地球到半人马座阿尔法星  
Travel from Earth to Alpha Centauri using laser-generated photons--

314
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,580
大约需45年
About 45 years.

315
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,760
最大速度  每秒3万公里
到达半人马座阿尔法星时长  45年

316
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,110
当前  美国宇航局及其他航天机构
Currently, NASA and other space agencies

317
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,490
计划发射更多的太阳帆
have plans for launching more solar sails.

318
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:12,990
但宇宙中还有其他更强大的动力源
But there are other, more powerful sources of propulsion in the universe.

319
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,070
十九世纪六十年代有人提出一种推进方法 
In the 1960s, a method of propulsion was proposed

320
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,760
即在飞船尾部
where a spacecraft would literally

321
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,470
安置一系列爆炸物
drop a series of explosive charges out the back,

322
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,420
爆炸带来的能量将推动飞船前进
and the force of the explosions would push the spacecraft forward.

323
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,200
原型机被称作"核脉冲推进"
The prototype was called the "Orion Drive,"

324
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,970
实际上人们进行了一系列常规炸药的试验
And there were actually a series of experiments done with conventional charges

325
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,610
以证明这是可行的
to show that it would work.

326
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,980
然而"核脉冲推进"燃料使用的是核弹
The Orion Drive, however, was proposed to use nuclear charges.

327
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,310
为模拟核脉冲形式的推进系统
In order to simulate an Orion-style propulsion system,

328
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,310
保罗和吉姆正在搭建示范装置 
Paul and Jim here are rigging up a demonstration

329
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,650
他们将少量化学炸药装入罐中 
where they're going to put a small chemical charge inside this barrel,

330
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,510
将其炸到约15至18米的空中
and we're going to lift this off the ground 50, 60 feet in the air.

331
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,530
我们将计算这次爆炸释放的能量 
We're going to actually calculate the energy released in this explosion

332
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,580
并将其同实际的核脉冲飞船系统中的 
and compare it to a nuclear charge you might find on an actual

333
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,090
核爆能量进行比较
Orion Spacecraft system.

334
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,190
核脉冲飞船模拟器已准备就绪
Our Orion spacecraft simulator is rigged and ready to go.

335
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,570
我们将在内部燃火  使其在空中爆炸
We're going to light off the charges inside, blow the can up into the air,

336
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,860
将其与核脉冲形式推进中
and compare that with the energy release from a

337
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,250
核爆炸所产生的能量进行比较
typical nuclear explosion that would be used on an Orion-style drive.

338
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,700
十九世纪五十年代后期
The Orion Spacecraft,

339
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,170
洛斯阿拉莫斯国家实验室所研制的核脉冲飞船
studied at Los Alamos in the late 1950s,

340
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,350
计划将核裂变作为推动力能源
proposed nuclear fission as its propulsion source.

341
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:41,370
裂变能量来自于原子核分解时
Fission energy is produced when the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts,

342
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,990
释放出中子与质子
producing free neutrons and protons

343
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,330
并产生大量的伽马射线能量
and release tremendous γ ray energy.

344
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,680
炸药使这个重达16公斤的罐子
The explosive charge in this 35-pound barrel

345
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,140
冲到高空约18米处
lofted it about 60 feet in the air.

346
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,900
而在广岛着陆的小型核弹能够
A small nuclear charge in the Hiroshima range would liberate

347
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,940
释放出约2,700万倍的能量
about 27 million times more energy.

348
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,680
显而易见  这是保证星体间航行
Clearly, that's a practical propulsion drive for

349
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,270
甚至星际航行的推进驱动力
interplanetary or even interstellar travel.

350
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,000
由于飞船尾部核脉冲推进需要大爆炸的冲击力
Because of the huge explosions that an Orion Drive would require, on the back of the spacecraft,

351
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,770
用以吸收爆炸冲击力的大块厚实金属板
you would have a huge, thick metal plate that would absorb the thrust of the explosion

352
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,710
以及一系列的冲击波吸收器便是不可缺少的
and a series of shock absorbers to keep the crews from

353
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,230
它们将船员与爆炸后的余震隔离
getting jolted each time the charges went off.

354
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,650
核裂变能源飞船的最大速度
The max speed of a nuclear-powered fission spacecraft--

355
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,950
大约是光速的5%
About 5% the speed of light.

356
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:45,600
最大速度  每秒1.5万公里

357
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,380
从地球到半人马座阿尔法星  
Travel time from Earth to Alpha Centauri--

358
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,230
大约需要90年
About 90 years.

359
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,030
最大速度  每秒1.5万公里
到达半人马座阿尔法星时长  90年

360
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,780
若不是能量来源十分强大  
Despite its powerful fuel source,

361
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,440
裂变飞船比还太阳帆要慢
the fission craft is actually slower than a solar sail.

362
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,280
加快速度意味着
Boosting speed would mean

363
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,420
它需要另种更剧烈的核反应
turning to another, more intense nuclear reaction.

364
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,000
人们熟知核裂变技术
Fission technology is well known and understood.

365
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,000
使用其制造能源已有几十年
And we've been using it to generate power here on Earth for decades,

366
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,410
但还存在另一种核技术
But there is another kind of nuclear technology,

367
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,280
即核聚变
and that is nuclear fusion.

368
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,450
太阳的能量来自于核聚变
Fusion is the power source of the Sun.

369
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,200
太阳核心的温度非常高
In the core of our Sun, the temperatures are so high,

370
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,060
原子们的剧烈运动导致其互相撞击
atoms are moving so fast that they slam into each other,

371
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,550
产生新的元素并释放能量
creating new elements and liberating energy.

372
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,610
与裂变相反  
The opposite of fission,

373
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:40,130
当两个原子熔合成单个新超重原子时 
fusion energy is produced when two atomic nuclei fuse together

374
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,880
就产生了聚变能
to form a single heavier nuclear.

375
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,320
从而释放出巨大能量
The result is a huge liberation of energy.

376
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:53,630
十九世纪七十年代的"戴德拉斯工程"
A fusion-powered spacecraft was proposed in a 1970s study

377
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,730
计划研究聚变能飞船
called "Project Daedelus."

378
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,860
其任务是造访巴纳德星
It's mission called for a trip to Barnard's star,

379
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,520
距地球约5.9光年
some 5.9 light years distant.

380
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,080
与核弹不同的是
Instead of nuclear bombs,

381
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,680
核聚能太空船的推进力
the fusion-powered craft creates the propulsion

382
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,840
源于一个反应箱
on board in a reaction chamber.

383
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,490
戴德拉斯级太空船的燃料球芯块
The fuel pellets for the Daedelus class starship

384
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,670
由氘-氦3的混合芯块组成
consisted of pellets composed of a deuterium-helium-3 mix.

385
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,780
由相对论性电子束激发
These would have been ignited by what we call relativistic electron beams.

386
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,310
这些含有极高能量的电子
These are extremely high energy electrons

387
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,200
击中氘-氦-3芯块
that would have hit the deuterium-helium-3 pellets,

388
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,530
致使它们融合
caused them to fuse,

389
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,670
并释放出大量能量
and a huge amount of energy would be released.

390
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:35,980
戴德拉斯需要二百五十个这样的芯块
The Daedelus design called for 250 of these pellets

391
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,730
在超过两年的时段中不间断地释放能量
to be released every second for over two years.

392
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,480
太空船将重达五万五千吨
The spacecraft would have weighed 55,000 tons,

393
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,880
其中绝大部分是燃料
most of which would have been fuel.

394
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,300
这个重量对宇宙飞船来说未免太大
The weight penalty for such a spacecraft would be high

395
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:53,450
但有一种先进技术能解决这个问题
but an advanced civilization could eliminate the problem

396
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:58,000
即在星际旅行过程中开采氢燃料
by mining the hydrogen fuel during its interstellar journey.

397
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,780
氘  或说重氢  
Deuterium, or heavy hydrogen,

398
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,130
在地球上储量丰富
exists in abundance on Earth,

399
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,840
尤其是在海水中  
notably in seawater,

400
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,040
但氦3则是更为罕见的同位素
but helium-3 is a much rarer isotope.

401
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,540
它存在于太阳系的月球上
In our Solar System, it can be found on the Moon

402
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:18,740
在木星和土星上的含量则极为丰富
and in vast quantities on Jupiter and Saturn.

403
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,020
科学家们提议在穿越物资匮乏的空间时
Scientists have proposed using huge hydrogen scoops

404
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,650
使用巨型集氢器来开采氦3
to mine the helium-3 needed to cross the void of space.

405
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,290
请试想
So it's conceivable

406
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,550
如果你有一艘核聚能太空船
that if you had a craft that was powered by nuclear fusion,

407
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,580
进入另一恒星系统时
you could go to another star system,

408
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,680
可以利用那颗星球上的氢来补充燃料
and then use the hydrogen available from that star to refuel.

409
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,650
设备齐全的聚合能太空船
The self-contained fusion-powered spacecraft

410
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,910
因而可以避免负载巨大的重量
could avoid a huge weight penalty

411
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,160
并以一定速度  
and reach speeds

412
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,040
在适当的时段内进行近恒星探测
that could allow near-star exploration in a reasonable time frame.

413
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,700
核聚能太空船的最大速度
The max speed of a nuclear-powered fusion spacecraft--

414
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,620
能达到光速的百分之十五
up to 15% of the speed of light.

415
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:05,430
最大速度  每秒4.7万公里

416
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,090
最大速度  每秒4.7万公里
到达半人马座阿尔法星时长  约35年

417
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,470
从地球到半人马座阿尔法星
Travel time from Earth to Alpha Centauri--

418
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,810
约需三十五年
about 35 years.

419
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,220
核动力航天的巨额花费  所需物流支持 
The immense costs, the logistics,

420
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,710
甚至国家政策在很久以前
and even the politics of nuclear-powered spaceflight

421
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,450
使得所有计划迟迟未能运行
long ago caused humanity to scrap any and all plans.

422
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,470
但是一个足够先进的文明社会
But a sufficiently advanced society

423
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,380
能够利用核动力
could trade nuclear propulsion

424
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,630
达成那些看似不可能的事
for what seems like an impossible paradox--

425
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:33,480
以光速达到瞬间位移
Traveling at light speed without moving at all.

426
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,910
UFO真能以高速
Can UFOs actually achieve the immense speeds

427
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,470
完成星际旅行吗
required for interstellar travel?

428
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,810
答案也许就埋藏在
One potential answer may be buried

429
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:52,850
美国核心地带的三十英尺之下
30 feet beneath the ground in America's heartland...

430
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,490
就在伊利诺斯州芝加哥郊外的
the Fermilab Tevatron Collider

431
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,740
费米实验室电子伏对撞机
outside Chicago, Illinois.

432
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:04,800
稍慢于光速的质子和反质子
Racing just below the speed of light, particles of protons and antiproton

433
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,020
分别由相反的方向发射
are launched in opposing directions.

434
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,310
以高能对撞形式结合
They meet in a high energy collision.

435
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,330
这种撞击产生的伽马射线  
The impact produces gamma rays--

436
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,120
是宇宙最强的能量源
the highest energy source known in the universe

437
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,690
也是实现星际旅行的可能性关键
and potentially the key to interstellar travel.

438
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,610
在地球上制造反物质的最佳方法
The best way of making antimatter here on Earth

439
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,650
克利福德・强森
南加州大学

440
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,710
就是采用
is to employ probably

441
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,080
爱因斯坦最为出名的方程式
the most famous equation that Einstein taught us,

442
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,040
即质能方程
which is E=mc2,

443
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,800
说明一定的质量是可以产生能量的
which tells us that for a certain amount of matter, we can get energy.

444
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,540
这个理论因其实际影响重大而意义非凡
It's a great idea because it's incredibly efficient.

445
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,750
可以把粒子中所有的质量转化成能量
You essentially take all of the mass in those particles and convert it into energy.

446
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,670
但如果反物质必须由人为产生
But how can antimatter exist in the universe

447
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,840
它怎么会存在于宇宙中呢
if it must be artificially manufactured?

448
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,000
这是来自费城的史蒂芬・H
That's the question that Stefan H. from Philadelphia

449
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,110
向宇宙提出的质疑
texted the Universe.

450
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,120
史蒂芬  反物质是一定存在的
Stefan, antimatter definitely exists,

451
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:28,590
反物质是否存在  我们将如何观测  
史蒂芬・H  宾夕法尼亚州费城

452
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,280
当它接触普通物质
and when it meets up with normal matter,

453
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,530
爆发出强大的电磁辐射
it explodes in a burst of electromagnetic radiation.

454
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,050
我们可以在实验室制造少量反物质
Now, we can make small bits of antimatter in laboratories,

455
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,680
但也可以从太空中收集
but we can also collect antimatter from space.

456
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,470
某些带电的宇宙光
Some cosmic rays, which are charged,

457
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,250
来自太空的高能粒子
very energetic particles coming from space,

458
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,740
的确是由反物质组成
actually consist of antimatter.

459
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,510
目前  超级对撞机是唯一
Currently, the super-collider is the only

460
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,370
在实际中生产反物质的方法
practical way to produce antimatter.

461
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,220
而如今它的数量有限
And right now it's created in very small quantities.

462
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,560
如果我们能找到
If we could figure out a way

463
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,900
生产和储存大量反物质的方法
to both create and store enough antimatter,

464
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:51,980
威廉・R・阿尔舒勒  
加利福尼亚人文研究所

465
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,100
我们将拥有一种可储存的燃料  
we would have a storable fuel which,

466
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,700
当它和普通物质混合时
when mixed with ordinary matter,

467
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,520
将释放出巨大能量
would liberate a huge amount of energy

468
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,220
比核裂变或是核聚合更有效
at a rate way beyond what either fission or fusion can do.

469
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,050
因为反物质是存在于世的
Because we know antimatter exists

470
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:06,650
我们可以生产并将其储存
and we know antimatter can be created and stored,

471
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,600
理查德・奥伯塞
 理论物理学家

472
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:10,540
也许某种先进文明
it is conceivable that an advanced civilization

473
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,790
可以生产并利用反物质能量
could create and harness the power of antimatter

474
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:17,390
用其制造一枚反物质火箭
in sufficient quantities to create an antimatter rocket.

475
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:23,430
一艘反物质飞船可以达到不可思议的速度
An antimatter ship could achieve unbelievable velocities,

476
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,140
仅次于光速
cruising just below light speed,

477
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:30,470
与穿过银河系的粒子束速度不相上下
nearly matching the speed of a star beam streaking across the galaxy.

478
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:37,550
最大速度  每秒28.5万公里

479
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,870
从地球到半人马座阿尔法星的行程时间
Travel time from Earth to Alpha Centauri

480
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,940
即通过4.5光年的路程
4 1/2 light years distant--

481
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:40,230
最大速度  每秒28.5万公里
到达半人马座阿尔法星时长  5年

482
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,890
大约需要5年
about 5 years.

483
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,510
人类无法想象
In human terms,

484
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,480
生产足够的反物质微粒
the cost of creating enough antimatter particles

485
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,080
来运作这样一艘星际飞船所需经费
to power such a starship would be astronomical.

486
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,490
也许外星人财力雄厚  足以承担
It might be affordable in alien currency,

487
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:58,470
但制造一艘反物质太空船所需代价太大
but an antimatter spacecraft like this comes at a high price.

488
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,460
来自于反物质动力的伽马射线危害极大
The gamma rays from antimatter propulsion are so dangerous,

489
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:07,940
它们会摧毁飞船上所有生物细胞结构
they could destroy the cell structure of any living beings aboard ship.

490
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,550
星际飞船上必须有一个先进的防护装置
This starship would have to include an advanced shielding mechanism

491
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,410
以保障船员的生命安全
to keep the crew alive.

492
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,530
其行驶速度飞快
And at such high rates of speed,

493
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,260
对宇宙有一定破坏作用
there are equally destructive threats in the universe.

494
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,300
宇宙空间浩瀚无边  
Space is pretty empty,

495
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,430
但如果以近光速行驶于其中
but if you were moving close to the speed of light,

496
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:32,200
露丝安妮・沃克薇姿
普林斯顿大学

497
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:31,080
就需要一个极佳的防护系统
you'd need an extremely effective shielding system

498
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,390
免其遭受星际尘粒的破坏
that would allow you to be protected from interstellar dust particles

499
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:38,100
它们几乎可以摧毁一艘光速行驶的太空船
that would all but annihilate a spacecraft traveling that fast.

500
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,550
但是如果太空垃圾如此危险
But if space debris is so dangerous,

501
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,020
何不避而远之呢
why not avoid it completely?

502
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,850
解决方案和星际迷航粉丝的想法有些类似
The solution might be one familiar to Star Trek fans,

503
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,770
即星际飞船
namely a starship that

504
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:55,360
以光速达成瞬间位移
could achieve light speed without even moving.

505
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,190
实际上可以制造一种曲速泡
In effect, one would create what is called a "Warp bubble"--

506
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,340
这名字源于科幻小说
the name taken straight out of science fiction--

507
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:06,060
就是当一艘太空船稳坐于这个扁平泡内
and that would involve compressing a region of space-time in front of a spacecraft

508
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,060
将太空船前某一范围内的时空压缩
and expanding a region of space-time behind a spacecraft

509
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:15,050
并扩大其后某范围内的时空
while the spacecraft itself sat stationary inside this flat bubble.

510
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,280
如此就能有效地驾驭时空波浪
So one would effectively be riding a wave of space-time.

511
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,760
曲速引擎就像一种纯粹理想化的实验状态
A warp drive may seem like pure Sci-Fi fantasy...

512
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:30,340
但在1994年  一位广受尊重的年轻物理学家
But in 1994, a well-respected young physicist

513
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,440
米给尔・阿库别瑞
named Miguel Alcubierre

514
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,100
发表了一份重大提议概述
published a serious proposal outlining

515
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,470
曲速引擎  广义相对论范围内的超速旅行

516
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,420
如何在受控的空间扭曲穿梭
how to travel in a controllable space warp.

517
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:47,270
阿库别瑞的曲速引擎还存在许多难题
There are huge obstacles to Alcubierre's warp-drive solution.

518
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:50,860
最大的障碍便是"暗能量"
The biggest is called "Dark energy"...

519
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,410
有三位科学家在2011年  
A cosmic phenomenon recognized in 2011

520
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:58,360
发现并证明了这一宇宙现象
when three scientists were awarded the Nobel prize

521
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,700
并因此获得诺贝尔奖
for proving its existence.

522
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,170
关于暗能量现象
The simplest explanation that's been proposed

523
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,740
最简单的解释就是
for the phenomenon of dark energy is that

524
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,060
空间自身的固有特性
there's an intrinsic property of space itself

525
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,110
令其趋向扩张膨胀
that makes it want to expand.

526
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:19,790
通过观察宇宙已逝去的时空
You can actually see it by looking at receding parts of the universe

527
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:23,140
以及额外的加速度便可知晓
and seeing that there's this extra acceleration component,

528
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,730
但又不像太阳能或其他能源
but it isn't a stored energy source

529
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:28,870
它并非可储存能源
like solar energy or other kinds of energy.

530
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,060
所以它也不是那么匪夷所思
And so it's not inconceivable--

531
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,550
宇宙某个角落
it's not beyond the realms of possibility

532
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,330
应该存在某种先进文明
that some advanced civilization

533
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,020
已然将暗能量技术谙熟于心
existing somewhere in the universe has learned

534
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:43,710
并利用其制造另种形式的动力
how to harness dark energy to create an exotic form of propulsion.

535
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,570
但实际上  曲速引擎还存在另一个障碍
But there's another obstacle to a workable warp drive.

536
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:53,060
利用扭曲将太空船往前推动的唯一办法
The only known way to pull a spacecraft forward within a warp

537
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:57,600
需要利用黑洞的剧烈能量
requires harnessing the intense energy of a black hole.

538
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,500
简单来说就是
The sort of simple notion is somehow

539
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,260
用某种方法制造一种高浓缩物质
to make a very concentrated bit of matter,

540
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,330
极度浓缩至可以产生黑洞
extremely concentrated, on the level which would cause a black hole.

541
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,820
如果能制造出一个小型黑洞
If you could generate a black hole on a small scale, so to speak,

542
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,140
让它悬浮在飞船前方
you could dangle it in front of the ship

543
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,260
利用它的空间扭曲拖动飞船缓缓前行
and use its space distortion to sort of drag the ship along.

544
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,720
由曲速引擎推动的外星飞船
And exactly how fast could a warp drive tow

545
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,070
到底有多快
an extraterrestrial spacecraft?

546
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:31,380
阿库别瑞在文中明显提出了以下观点
The clear implication of Alcubierre's work was that it should be possible,

547
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,330
如果你能设计出曲速引擎
if you can make this design of a warp drive,

548
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:39,890
其速度就能达到光速的任意倍
to achieve speeds almost any multiple of the speed of light.

549
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,790
一艘由空间扭曲驱动的光速飞船
Travel time from Earth to Alpha Centauri

550
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,570
最大速度  每秒至少29.9万公里

551
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,960
从地球到半人马座阿尔法星的时间
aboard a light speed craft powered by a space warp--

552
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,230
约四年半
about 4 1/2 years...

553
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,030
最大速度  每秒至少29.9万公里
到达半人马座阿尔法星时长  至多4.5年

554
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:54,560
只要能保障船内人员安全  时间可以更短
or less, as long as everyone on board doesn't incinerate.

555
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:00,330
阿库别瑞的引擎存在一个问题
One problem with the Alcubierre drive is within that warp bubble,

556
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:02,650
凯文・格雷瑟尔
行星学家

557
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,990
曲速泡中的温度远比太阳内核要高
temperatures would rise to far hotter than the core of our Sun.

558
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,250
非常热
That's hot.

559
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:13,330
到达地球之前还有一个小问题
Just one more small problem to solve for the chance to reach planet Earth.

560
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,710
如果一艘将要抵达地球大气层的外星飞船
But what if such an alien spacecraft were to arrive in earth's atmosphere,

561
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,310
在曲速泡中行驶
riding in a warp bubble,

562
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,190
被黑洞拖着呢
towed by a black hole?

563
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,540
即使这并非拥有众多目击证人的首例
It might not be the first mass-witness UFO sighting,

564
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:29,140
但一定会是最后一次
but it would certainly be the last.

565
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,640
1997年3月13日
March 13, 1997...

566
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:40,190
成千上万人目睹了一次光学现象
thousands of people witness an optical phenomenon

567
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,300
漂浮在亚利桑那州的上空
drifting across the Arizona skies.

568
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,860
有关几何形亮点的消息传得沸沸扬扬
Reports of a series of bright lights in geometric patterns are widespread,

569
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,410
包括多人目睹一艘身长1.6公里
including multiple sightings over Phoenix

570
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,830
并伴有规律性灯光闪烁的太空船
of a craft up to a mile wide with lights

571
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,930
出现在凤凰城上空
winking on and off in sequence.

572
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,640
重现当晚的景象
Reconstructing the events of that evening,

573
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:05,600
凯文・格雷瑟尔
行星学家

574
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,880
那次凤凰城的闪烁灯光就是
the lights of the phoenix lights were almost certainly

575
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,420
空军战机A-10抛出的信号弹
flares dropped by an air force A-10 aircraft,

576
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,790
加之人类会将其联想为一个实体外形
in conjunction with the human tendency to envision a solid shape connecting them.

577
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,720
这才是凤凰城灯光事件的最好解释
That's the best explanation for the Phoenix lights.

578
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,590
对很多人来说  凤凰城灯光事件正是
For many, the Phoenix lights incident was

579
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:26,370
巨型宇宙飞船曾造访此地的直接佐证
direct proof that a huge extraterrestrial craft had arrived.

580
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,650
有人甚至将其称为母舰
Some even called it a mother ship.

581
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,560
母舰存在的目的
The purpose of an extraterrestrial mother ship

582
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,380
是外星人造访理论的基础
is fundamental to the theories of alien visitation.

583
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:43,630
这是穿越星际空间中遥远距离的唯一方式
It's the only way to bridge the vast distances of interstellar space.

584
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,360
"母舰"这一说法
The term "Mother ship," I think,

585
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,800
威廉・R・阿尔舒勒
《不明飞行物之科学》作者

586
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,540
和"飞碟"这个词是在同一时期出现的
came into being around the same time that "Flying saucers" as a term came into being.

587
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,150
大众普遍认为
And I think the universal notion

588
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:58,700
仅能容下一人的航空器无法完成星际旅行
was you couldn't make an interstellar trip in a person-sized craft.

589
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,250
一定得是巨型飞船
You have to have something really large.

590
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,890
理查德・奥博塞
理论物理学家

591
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:06,360
母舰就如地球上的航空母舰一样 
An apt earthly analogy of a mother ship is that of an aircraft carrier.

592
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,880
航空母舰穿梭于大洋之间 
An aircraft carrier travels the vast distances across the oceans,

593
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:13,470
其目的则是运载小型战机
but its purpose is to transport smaller aircraft which

594
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,720
这样它们便可执行任务等等
can then go on and engage in whatever their missions may be.

595
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,350
如果需要成百上千年才能抵达地球
If the journey to Earth is long, on the order of centuries or even millennia,

596
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:27,790
母舰会比航空母舰有更多的功能
the mother ship would be much more than just an aircraft carrier.

597
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,840
这是一艘"方舟"
There's the generational or "Ark ship,"

598
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,490
它是一艘拥有独立生态系统的巨型飞船
Which is a very large spacecraft that is essentially an enclosed ecosystem,

599
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:41,030
居民会在船舱内生老病死
in which generations of inhabitants expect to be born, grow old, and die

600
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:45,740
直至很长时间后抵达最终目的地
over the long period it takes the spacecraft to reach its ultimate destination.

601
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,010
利用"假死"技术
Perhaps with technology, such as suspended animation,

602
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,890
外星乘客会进入睡眠状态
biological alien passengers could be put to sleep

603
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:57,250
直到长途旅行结束时再苏醒
and revived after the vast journey.

604
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,350
若要在这一航行中幸存下来 
Surviving such a journey would also mean

605
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:06,620
就要能承受住推动飞船航行的破坏性能量
surviving the destructive energy powering the spacecraft itself.

606
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,630
其中一种合理的设计  
One logical design solution,

607
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,610
是雪茄形的母舰
a cigar-shaped mother ship,

608
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:16,850
正是众多不明飞行物目击者声称所看到的
is precisely what many UFO witnesses claim to have seen.

609
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,110
对任何一种先进动力系统来说 
For any advanced propulsion system,

610
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:24,420
都会尽可能让船员远离
you would want to situate the crew as far away as possible

611
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,580
引擎动力源
from the engine source.

612
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:30,140
所以飞船都是极细长的设计
So one possible design would be a very long, thin design,

613
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:33,140
引擎置于在飞船尾端
with the engine located at one end of the spacecraft

614
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,270
其间用某种框架将船员区尽可能地
and then some kind of truss connecting the crew section

615
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,670
与这种先进动力装置隔开  
as far away as possible

616
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,870
以避免高能中子
so as to avoid damage from high-energy neutrons,

617
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:44,200
X射线以及伽玛射线对人体的损害
x-rays, or gamma rays from the advanced propulsion system.

618
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,030
倘若此种方舟曾抵达地球
If such ark ships have in fact visited planet earth,

619
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,270
它们所留下的痕迹则是无法磨灭的
the evidence would be overwhelming and undeniable.

620
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,000
所有外星先进的推进技术有一个共同点
Something all these exotic and advanced propulsion technologies have in common

621
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,450
即它们都能辐射出巨大能量
is that they all radiate prodigious amounts of energy,

622
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,240
因此就算隔了几光年的距离
and so we'd be able to see them,

623
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,960
我们也能观测到  
like beacons on a lighthouse,

624
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,270
就像灯塔上的信号灯一样
from sometimes light years away.

625
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,620
X射线束  伽玛射线束
The concentrated emission of x-rays, gamma rays,

626
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,910
甚至次原子微粒团都是可疑现象
or subatomic particles would be suspicious,

627
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,560
因为这些都不是地球上
'cause we don't see that in our environment locally

628
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,190
所常见的现象
under any normal circumstances.

629
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,200
除去肉眼所能见到的迹象
Beyond the obvious visual evidence,

630
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,450
一艘母舰
the physical effect of a mother ship

631
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,780
靠近地球表面所产生的物理效应
approaching so close to the Earth's surface

632
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,580
能导致一场大灾难
could be a terrifying form of apocalypse.

633
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,830
若出于某种原因  
If, for whatever reason,

634
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:40,480
该外星文明没有关闭引擎
this extraterrestrial technology or civilization chose not to turn off their engines,

635
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,790
地球生物则会经历一场浩劫  
it could be catastrophic for life on Earth,

636
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:47,640
受到高能中子  X射线以及伽玛射线的荼毒
as we would be bathed in high-energy neutrons, x-rays, and gamma rays.

637
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,460
若是某种"曲速飞行"
If it's something which is a version of a warp drive,

638
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,130
那么就会产生空间畸变
then you're talking about space distortion, and

639
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:58,880
就不能接近大质量的物体  包括星球
you wouldn't want to be too close to any major mass, including the planet.

640
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,790
这种劫难访问说认为
Such catastrophic visitations assume that

641
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:08,930
外星人甘愿舍身于外太空只为造访地球
aliens are willing to risk their own lives in interstellar space...

642
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,270
但是或许还有更好的方法
But there might be a better way...

643
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,580
他们可以待在自己的星球上
They could stay at home...

644
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:24,620
利用智能机器人来探索宇宙奥秘
and explore the cosmos using a race of thinking machines.

645
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:34,030
对于不明飞行物的众多狂热爱好者来说
For many ardent believers in the UFO phenomenon,

646
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:37,680
1947年夏  美国新墨西哥州罗斯威尔
the Roswell, New Mexico, event in the summer of 1947

647
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,900
是人类史上首次接触外星人
is the defining alien encounter in human history.

648
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:42,200
罗斯威尔
市区范围
高空3570

649
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,300
民间传闻中  有关这次坠毁事件
In popular culture, the most lasting detail from the purported crash

650
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:53,950
最持久不衰的是发现了外星尸体的消息
came from the descriptions of extraterrestrial bodies found at the scene.

651
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:00,840
随后几十年里  这种想象中的"灰种人"
In the ensuing decades, this vision of alien beings, known as "The grays,"

652
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,790
常出现在科幻小说中
Became the accepted standard in science fiction

653
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,920
或是外星人事件报道里
and recurring alien-encounter reports.

654
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,360
硕大的头部也许解释了
The oversized heads may explain

655
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:17,810
我们所预料的外星人特征  即它们智商过人
an expected feature in alien biology-- Greater intelligence.

656
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:21,420
与人类相比  头骨越大脑容量越大
The larger skulls would contain larger, more advanced brains

657
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,820
大脑更发达
compared to ours.

658
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:28,380
在星际航行中要解决棘手问题
Mastering the profound challenges of interstellar travel

659
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,330
固然需要更加智能的物种
would certainly require great intelligence,

660
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:36,660
但它还需要超出有机生物系统的元素吗
but might it require something that is beyond organic biology?

661
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,430
科幻小说中包含的误重大误区
One area of science fiction where we might be making kind of a big mistake

662
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:43,450
赛斯・肖斯塔科
地外文明搜索研究所

663
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:46,620
即我们将外星人臆想成某种生物体
is to assume that the aliens are biological, that they're living things.

664
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:53,880
威廉・R・阿尔舒勒
加利福尼亚人文研究所

665
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:52,510
我认为  有很多种有机体
I think that the possibilities for the kinds of organisms

666
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,360
可以进行星际航行
which might travel between the stars are really wide open.

667
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:59,060
可能在科幻小说中所提及的
And one possibility that has appeared on occasion in

668
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,910
实际上是指智能机器人
science fiction is machine intelligence.

669
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,630
根据近期出现的方程  即摩尔定律
According to a recent earthly equation known as Moore's Law,

670
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,300
单机芯片上的晶体管数量
the number of transistors on a single computer chip

671
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,470
每18个月增加一倍
doubles every 18 months,

672
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,380
意味着计算机处理速率也会快一倍
meaning computer processing speed doubles.

673
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,150
这种趋势已持续了半个世纪以上
This trend has continued for more than half a century and

674
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:24,870
至少要延至2020年以后
is expected to continue through 2020 or later.

675
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:28,770
处理速率的爆炸式增长
The exponential explosion of processing speed

676
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,940
为以"人工智能"为题材的科幻小说
is opening the door on a staple of science fiction

677
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,600
开启了一道大门
called "Artificial Intelligence."

678
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,440
如果你发明了一台智能机器  一百年之后
So, if you invent a thinking machine, 100 years later,

679
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,070
它不止是比你要聪明
that machine is not only smarter than you are,

680
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,380
它还比此前任何人都要聪明
it's smarter than all humans that have ever lived.

681
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,470
这就是人工智能
And that's the difference

682
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,280
与真正人的智力之间的差别
between artificial intelligence and real intelligence.

683
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,950
人工智能能够飞速进化
Artificial intelligence can evolve enormously faster.

684
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:57,200
但最令我们担心又期待的在于
But I think the form of AI that we find most both menacing and promising

685
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,180
人工智能既能够像人脑般运作 
is the kind of AI that could in fact do what our brains can do,

686
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,570
又具备人类的思维
can think the way we can think.

687
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,800
在斯坦福大学的人工智能实验室中
At Stanford university's artificial intelligence laboratory,

688
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,720
智能机器的发展趋势就是这种倾向
the future of truly intelligent machines is rapidly approaching.

689
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,460
以下难点使得人工智能变得十分棘手
There are a few things that make AI difficult.

690
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:20,870
即我们不知如何去改进计算机
One is we don't really know yet how to make computers learn as

691
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,110
让它的学习效率变得和人类一样
effectively as humans can.

692
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,290
似乎现代计算机运行速度受限仅仅是因为
It seems that our computers today just aren't as fast as we

693
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,430
人类不愿让它们模仿其认知过程
would like them to get to simulate the learning processes

694
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,500
进而取代人脑
that take place in the human brain.

695
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,400
人工智能实验室

696
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,550
斯坦福的学生设计了一台击打型机器臂
To demonstrate early-stage artificial intelligence,

697
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:41,040
来演示人工智能研究的初期成效
Stanford students designed a fighting robot--

698
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,540
是一台在击打中学习的智能机
One that attempts to learn as it fights.

699
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,560
它现在在做的是  自我防守
Okay, so what it's doing now-- It's trying to defend itself,

700
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,550
它会随着您的动作作出反应
so it's reacting to your motion.

701
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,600
即这个机器人会根据您手中剑的走向  
So, depending on how you move your sword,

702
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:57,080
对您的动作行为作出反应
the robot will adapt to your motion and to your behavior.

703
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:01,340
研发此类机器人对于真正人工智能的意义
How important a step on the road to true artificial intelligence

704
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,010
有多深远呢  托尔斯滕
are robots like this, Torsten?

705
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,480
我们在这里运用的人工智能方案
So here we are using artificial-intelligence methods,

706
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,890
比如认知方案  是让机器人适应其周围环境
like learning methods, to adapt to the environment of the robot,

707
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:16,910
但我们对机器人的真实想法无从了解
but we are still not at a stage where the robot is really thinking.

708
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:21,470
现代计算机的智能依旧不及普通人类
Today's computers are still far less intelligent than almost any human.

709
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:26,140
但着眼于未来  我相信计算机最终
But in the future, I think computers could eventually

710
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,040
能达到甚至超越人类智力
reach, and maybe even surpass, human intelligence.

711
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,500
倘若真到了这一步  设想每人的钱包里
And if that's the case, imagine that each of us has a computer

712
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,680
都有台电脑  在手机或钱包里都可以
in our wallet--a cell phone or wallet--

713
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,790
智力能与爱因斯坦相抗衡  甚至超越他
That was as smart as Einstein or even smarter.

714
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,340
整个文明将会怎样变化
How will civilization change,

715
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,520
那时的人类又会做出怎样的创举呢
and what are the amazing things we could do then?

716
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,730
这种击打型机器人引领世界尖端科技
Advanced as it is on Earth, the fencing robot is

717
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,280
它是能够适用于星际航空器中的
but a crude analogy for the type of machine intelligence that

718
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,940
人工智能机的简单模拟
could pilot an interstellar spacecraft.

719
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:58,260
智能机的革新将首次接触
The immense obstacles of space travel,

720
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,680
星际航行中的大问题
including the sheer time scale and cosmic hazards,

721
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:07,700
包括时标偏离及宇宙无尽凶险
build a strong case that a race of intelligent machines will make first contact.

722
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,070
但话说回来  倘若真的存在星际航行一说
But honestly, if interstellar travel really takes place,

723
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,970
送出非生物体才是明智之举
it seems sort of reasonable to not send the biological beings.

724
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,610
因为生物体的生命力有限  经不起这样的折腾  
I mean, they're fragile. They have finite lifetimes.

725
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,840
在美国宇航局领先于人类探索
Just as NASA sends robotic probes to explore the Solar

726
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,950
将勘探机器人送去探测太阳系之际
System in advance of human explorers,

727
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,240
兴许我们会通过外星来的勘探机器人
our first contact with an alien civilization

728
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:30,540
凯文・格雷瑟尔
行星学家

729
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,540
与异星文明发生首次碰触
may be with its robotic probes.

730
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,280
它究竟是生物体还是人工智能体
Biologic being or AI super being?

731
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:38,370
我们的憧憬在与其首次接触前
Our vision of an extraterrestrial will remain

732
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,580
都属于纯粹的臆测
mere speculation until first contact is made.

733
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,190
但我们要等多久呢
But how long will we wait?

734
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,170
撇开缺失确凿证据不说
And despite a lack of hard evidence,

735
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,910
异域智慧文明
just how likely is the

736
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:53,200
存在的可能性有多大呢
existence of another intelligent civilization?

737
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,080
有人确信
Some believe it is highly likely

738
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,970
宇宙每个角落都有生物存在的迹象
that the universe teems with life.

739
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,730
银河星系存在了很长时间
The galaxy has been around for a long time.

740
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,260
太阳系虽是悠久
The Solar System's been around for quite a long time,

741
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:09,030
但也不及它的历史久远
but the galaxy much longer.

742
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,660
银河系中的星体
And the stars in it--

743
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,420
有许多比太阳和太阳系都要古老
Many of them are much older than the Sun and our Solar System.

744
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,100
所以  如果存在异星文明
So the chances are, if civilizations are out there,

745
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,620
它们应该比人类文明要源远流长得多
they've been around for longer than we have.

746
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,160
倘若真的存在  就说有十万年了吧
If they exist, say, for 100,000 years,

747
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,950
这种异域文明间的碰触几率就非常大了  
then the chances are pretty good, I think,

748
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:26,180
它们应该掌握了 能在宇宙间交流的方式  
they will have learned to either communicate

749
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,370
甚至是星际航行技术
across interstellar space or possibly travel.

750
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,160
而在首次接触之前
Until first contact occurs,

751
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,310
人类只能继续仰望星空搜寻不明飞行物
humanity will continue to scan the skies for UFOs.

752
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:41,740
目前依然无从证明外星飞船的存在
None have been proven to be extraterrestrial craft so far,

753
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,010
但这并不是否认人类总有一天会
but that does not rule out the possibility that humanity may

754
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:49,650
发现智慧文明存在的痕迹
one day discover evidence of an intelligent civilization,

755
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,570
也许它就在苍穹尽头的某处  
they were on heavens,

756
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:54,240
更靠近它们家园的地方
or much closer to home.
