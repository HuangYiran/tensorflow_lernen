《帷幕: 波罗的最后一个案子》

3
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:34,767
您应该是黑斯廷斯上校吧
Captain Hastings, I presume.

4
00:01:34,807 --> 00:01:38,375
我是黛西・勒特雷尔 很荣幸见到您 
Daisy Luttrell. Delighted. 

5
00:01:38,376 --> 00:01:39,127
您好
How do you do?

6
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:40,647
可怜的波罗先生
Poor Monsieur Poirot

7
00:01:40,687 --> 00:01:43,087
他一直非常期待您的到来
He's been so looking forward to your coming.

8
00:01:43,127 --> 00:01:45,247
都激动坏了
He's quite beside himself.

9
00:01:45,287 --> 00:01:47,026
他最近怎么样
How is he? 

10
00:01:47,027 --> 00:01:49,287
相信他看到您会好很多的
He'll be much the better for seeing you.

11
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:51,967
托比 这是黑斯廷斯上校
Ah, Toby! Captain Hastings.

12
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:53,447
您好
How do you do?

13
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:55,033
乘三点四十的车来的吧
Came by the 3.40, eh?

14
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,873
我们一时冲动买下的这里
We bought this place in a fit of madness.

15
00:01:58,313 --> 00:02:00,633
这把年纪了还开庄园
Guest house keepers at our age!

16
00:02:00,673 --> 00:02:02,793
话说回来 这世道免不了
Still, needs must these days...

17
00:02:03,593 --> 00:02:06,538
至少我俩里面 我还有点商业头脑 
...and at least one of us has a good business head. 

18
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:07,313
是吧托比
Don't I, Toby?

19
00:02:07,353 --> 00:02:09,193
快点 快点
Chop, chop!

20
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:11,393
送上校去他的房间
Take the captain up to his room.

21
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:14,273
当然 您也可以先见见波罗先生
Unless, of course, you'd prefer to see Monsieur Poirot first.

22
00:02:14,313 --> 00:02:15,553
是的 我想先去 
Yes, I would. 

23
00:02:15,554 --> 00:02:18,033
那就先领客人去休息室 然后再安顿行李
Drawing room, Toby. Then see to the cases.

24
00:02:25,593 --> 00:02:27,473
诺顿
Ah, Norton.

25
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:28,928
在西卡莫槭树的旁 旁边
Pair of n-nesting b-blackcaps 

26
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,473
有一对黑 黑顶林莺在筑巢
down by the sycamore.

27
00:02:30,513 --> 00:02:32,633
这位是...
This is...

28
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,456
无良建筑商
Blasted builders! 

29
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:36,513
比尔 这位是黑斯廷斯上校
Bill, this is Captain Hastings.

30
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:38,593
黑斯廷斯 你好
Hastings, yes.

31
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:40,611
我是威廉姆・波伊德・卡灵顿爵士 
Sir William Boyd Carrington. 

32
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:41,353
看我这暴脾气
Excuse the tantrum.

33
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:44,233
我正在装修我的旧所 奈顿公馆 你听过吗
Having my old place tarted up. Knatton Hall, y'know?

34
00:02:44,273 --> 00:02:46,593
这些懒货真是踢一脚动一动
Lazy blighters need a good kick up the backside.

35
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,833
所以你就是那个著名的黑斯廷斯
So you're the famous Hastings?

36
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:51,913
那个小个子的比利时伙计没完没了地念叨着你
The little Belgian chappie never stops talking about you.

37
00:02:51,953 --> 00:02:54,273
- 你女儿也在这里对吧 - 是的
- And we've got your daughter up here as well. - Yes.

38
00:02:54,313 --> 00:02:55,793
漂亮姑娘
Fine girl.

39
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,593
可惜富兰克林成天只知道
Pity Franklin has her slicing up 

40
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,193
让她开老鼠和兔子的膛
rats and rabbits all day.

41
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:01,113
不好意思 我还要打个电话冲他们吼一顿
Excuse me while I give 'em another earful.

42
00:03:08,193 --> 00:03:10,793
请接塔明斯特 7211号
Tadminster 7211.

43
00:03:17,273 --> 00:03:19,913
波罗 有人来看你了
Poirot? There's someone to see you.

44
00:03:34,793 --> 00:03:36,553
黑斯廷斯
Hastings.

45
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:40,833
黑斯廷斯 最最亲爱的黑斯廷斯
Hastings, my dear, dear, Hastings.

46
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,313
- 波罗 老伙计 - 我的老朋友 老朋友
- Poirot, old chap. - Oh, mon ami, mon ami!

47
00:03:46,953 --> 00:03:51,873
我差点忘了 这位是才华横溢的科尔小姐
But I forget myself. This is the talented Mademoiselle Cole.

48
00:03:54,873 --> 00:03:56,633
黑斯廷斯上校
Captain Hastings.

49
00:03:57,913 --> 00:04:00,643
你真是老当益壮啊 老伙计 
You have worn well, mon ami. 

50
00:04:00,644 --> 00:04:02,953
霜华满鬓 却还是腰杆笔挺
With the straight back and the grey of the hair.

51
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:07,793
但是斯人逝去 你还是忘不了啊
But the wound...that is still fresh, huh?

52
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:12,353
已经是最好的结局了
No man could have wished for better.

53
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:16,193
最终 她能够死得其所
Still, she died as she would have wanted.

54
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,353
并没有受到漫长的折磨
No long, drawn-out suffering.

55
00:04:18,393 --> 00:04:20,033
是啊
Bon.

56
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:21,744
你呢 你怎么样 
And how are you? 

57
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:24,753
我? 我糟透了 不 是半截入土了
Me? I am a wreck. No, a ruin.

58
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,749
我没法下地走路 腿跛了也扭曲了 
I cannot walk. I am crippled and twisted. 

59
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,553
需要像小孩一样被人照料
I have to be attended to like a baby.

60
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:32,833
但是内在的我 黑斯廷斯 还是健全的
But the core, Hastings, that is still sound.

61
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,873
你是世上最好心的人 波罗
You have the best heart in the world, Poirot.

62
00:04:34,913 --> 00:04:39,313
心倒是不怎么样 但头脑还是一样敏锐
The heart, no, but the brain-as magnificent as ever.

63
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:41,433
黑斯廷斯 快停下 停
Hastings, do stop, do!

64
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:45,113
- 这不是在推独轮车 - 抱歉 老伙计
- It is not a wheelbarrow. - Sorry, old chap.

65
00:04:46,673 --> 00:04:48,953
时隔这么多年后再回来 感觉怎么样
So is it good to be back after all these years?

66
00:04:48,993 --> 00:04:50,513
食物实在是太可怕了 
The food, it is disgusting. 

67
00:04:50,514 --> 00:04:52,033
应该是定量配给吧
Rationing, I suppose.

68
00:04:52,073 --> 00:04:54,353
不 我说的是英国菜
No, it is the English cooking.

69
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,513
还有水 永远是半温不烫的
And the water, always so tepid,

70
00:04:57,553 --> 00:05:00,953
毛巾薄的 简直没法用
and the towels so thin they're of no use at all.

71
00:05:00,993 --> 00:05:02,513
那你为什么回来
Then why did you come?

72
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,193
因为我在报纸上看到了那起广告
Because when I see the advertisement in the newspaper

73
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:08,442
知道了你的女儿会来这里
and discover your daughter, she will be here... 

74
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:09,953
我突然有了个计划
I conceive of a plan.

75
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:13,092
我会说服我的老朋友黑斯廷斯过来 
I will persuade my old friend Hastings 

76
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:15,673
然后我们会像家人那样团聚
to join us and we shall all be together en famille.

77
00:05:15,713 --> 00:05:17,513
真叫人开心 是吧
It is most agreeable, n'est-ce pas?

78
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:21,073
你是不是暗中有什么把戏
You're up to something, aren't you?

79
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,833
是的
Oui.

80
00:05:22,873 --> 00:05:24,273
我就知道
I knew it!

81
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:25,894
要不然为什么来这里 
Otherwise why come back to 

82
00:05:25,895 --> 00:05:27,793
我们第一次一起破案的地方
the scene of our first murder?

83
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:32,153
因为 我的朋友 我担心
Because, mon ami, I fear...

84
00:05:33,393 --> 00:05:35,673
这儿很快会再有一次谋杀案
...it will soon be the scene of another.

85
00:05:37,673 --> 00:05:39,050
你确定吗
Are you sure about this? 

86
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:41,633
你觉得我得了脑组织软化症吗
You think I have the softening of the brain?

87
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:44,593
不 我不是这个意思 但不太可能啊
No. No, but it seems so unlikely -

88
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:47,753
这么多年之后 在同一地点再次发生谋杀案
another murder all these years later, under the same roof.

89
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:49,793
没错 就是这么回事
Tres bien, that is how it is.

90
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,753
- 你能制止吗 - 你觉得我该怎么做
- Can't you stop it? - How do you propose that I do that?

91
00:05:52,793 --> 00:05:54,504
你可以警告一下受害者 
You could warn the victim. 

92
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:56,073
我不知道谁是受害者
I do not know who is the victim.

93
00:05:56,113 --> 00:05:58,073
那你一定知道谁是凶手
You must know who the killer is.

94
00:05:58,113 --> 00:05:59,753
不知道
Non.

95
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,433
那你到底是怎么知道会有谋杀案的
Then how on earth do you know it's going to happen?

96
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:05,193
- 我不能说 - 为什么
- I cannot say. - Why not?

97
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:07,913
因为...
Because...

98
00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:11,033
你还是以前的老样子 黑斯廷斯
you are still the same old Hastings.

99
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:12,758
你的脸上一点都藏不住事儿 
You have the speaking countenance 

100
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,833
我可不想你盯着所有的宾客看个不停
and I do not wish you to stare at all the guests

101
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:16,577
完全管不住自己的嘴 
with your mouth wide open and give, 

102
00:06:16,578 --> 00:06:18,793
然后 用你的话说 露了马脚
as you say, the game away.

103
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,419
波罗 这话可说的重了啊 
I say, Poirot, that's a bit strong. 

104
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,873
你知道我还是会打扑克的
I do play poker, you know.

105
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:24,033
是啊 总是输
Yes, and always lose.

106
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:27,873
但这可不是游戏 朋友 千万不能犯错
But this is not a game, mon ami, make no mistake.

107
00:06:27,913 --> 00:06:30,619
这次我们可是有任务的
There is here work to be done... 

108
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,553
这才是我叫你来的原因
and that is why I ask you here.

109
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,753
你就把动脑的事儿留给我
Now, the thinking you will leave to me,

110
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:38,113
但是我需要你 我最重要的黑斯廷斯
but I need you, my most invaluable Hastings,

111
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:42,193
来当我的眼睛和耳朵 去到我去不了的地方
to be my eyes and my ears, to go to places where I cannot go...

112
00:06:42,953 --> 00:06:45,181
去捕捉谈话中的只言片语 
...to sniff out the snatched conversation, 

113
00:06:45,182 --> 00:06:48,153
和不为人知的秘密 然后回来汇报给我
the shared confidence, and report back to me.

114
00:06:49,113 --> 00:06:51,713
因为我们之间潜藏着一个杀人凶手
For I tell you there is here amongst us a murderer,

115
00:06:51,753 --> 00:06:54,033
而我们必须制止这个人
and that person must be stopped.

116
00:06:57,553 --> 00:06:59,833
这位是柯蒂斯 我的贴身男仆
Here is Curtis, mon valet.

117
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:02,473
你的贴身男仆 乔治呢
Your valet! Where's George?

118
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:06,913
他回伊斯特布恩去侍候病重的老父亲了
It was necessary for him to go to Eastbourne to care for his ailing father.

119
00:07:16,913 --> 00:07:18,913
我来了
Well... I got here.

120
00:07:18,953 --> 00:07:21,153
真不简单
Very clever of you.

121
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:25,073
- 你记得我父亲吧 - 你好
- You remember my father? - Hello.

122
00:07:25,993 --> 00:07:28,092
我听说你给我女儿分配了不少工作啊 
I hear you work my daughter very hard, 

123
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:28,833
富兰克林医师
Dr Franklin.

124
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:29,777
没有的事
Nonsense. 

125
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:32,673
我总是太全神贯注于一件事情了
I'm afraid I get so awfully wrapped up in a thing.

126
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:36,338
赫尔克里叔叔还好吗
How did you find Uncle Hercule? 

127
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:38,193
不好 一点都不好
Not well. Not well at all.

128
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:41,583
我答应了芭芭拉要去为她读会儿书
I promised I'd read to Barbara. 

129
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:42,193
我得去...
I'd better...

130
00:07:45,793 --> 00:07:47,593
好像她自己不会读似的
As if she couldn't read herself.

131
00:07:48,273 --> 00:07:50,339
富兰克林夫人怎么样 
How is Mrs Franklin? 

132
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,233
老样子 变本加历了
The same and rather more so.

133
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:53,833
她只是喜欢大惊小怪
She just likes making a fuss.

134
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,793
- 这话说的有点过了啊 - 是真的
- That's rather harsh. - It's true.

135
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,836
她完全不在意约翰的工作 
She takes no interest in John's work, 

136
00:07:57,837 --> 00:07:59,673
没完没了地唠叨她的身体
goes on and on about her health.

137
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,993
你们在这儿呢
Ah, there you are.

138
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:05,273
以为科学怪人又拖你去他的实验室了
Thought Frankenstein had dragged you off to his lab again.

139
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:06,713
这是我父亲
This is my father.

140
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,873
- 阿勒顿 - 黑斯廷斯
- Allerton. - Hastings.

141
00:08:08,913 --> 00:08:10,633
久仰大名
Heard a lot about you.

142
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:12,873
波罗忠实的副官 对吧
Poirot's loyal lieutenant, eh?

143
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:31,713
你能来真是太好了
I'm so glad you're here.

144
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:34,993
赫尔克里叔叔总能让你不再自怨自艾
Uncle Hercule always manages to bring you out of yourself.

145
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,569
他一直情绪低落 
He gets so sad. 

146
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,873
你得让他低落一阵子 亲爱的
Ah, well, you must allow him that, mon cher.

147
00:08:38,913 --> 00:08:41,393
纠结于过去又有什么用呢
What's the use of dwelling on the past?

148
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,593
我们必须着眼未来
We must all look forward.

149
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:45,913
你整晚看起来都怪怪的
You know, you've been rather queer all evening.

150
00:08:45,953 --> 00:08:48,913
- 我没有啊 - 你盯着大家看来看去
- I don't know what you mean. - Staring at everyone.

151
00:08:48,953 --> 00:08:51,313
完全藏不住事儿
You're so transparent.

152
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:54,393
可能是因为故地重游 想起了过去和逝者
Maybe it's being back here with its memories and ghosts.

153
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,033
- 这里有过一次谋杀案是吧 - 对
- There was a murder, wasn't there? - Oui.

154
00:08:57,073 --> 00:08:59,153
这房子的女主人被毒死了
The lady of the house, she was poisoned.

155
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:03,313
她控制了 用你们的话说 家里的经济大权
She controlled, as you say, the purse strings,

156
00:09:03,353 --> 00:09:04,800
但是她的继子女们觉得
but her stepchildren felt 

157
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:06,393
他们没有了生活的自主权
they had no life of their own.

158
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:08,113
那真是太自私了
That's so selfish.

159
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:10,793
老人和病人不该倚仗自己弱势
Old people, sick people, shouldn't be allowed 

160
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:12,113
就毁掉别人的生活
to ruin the lives of others.

161
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:14,993
- 朱蒂丝 - 我没那个意思...
- Judith! - Oh, I didn't mean...

162
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:17,433
自私可不是老年人的专利 
Selfishness is not the monopoly of the old, 

163
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:19,433
这点我能保证 亲爱的
I can assure you, mon cher.

164
00:09:19,473 --> 00:09:21,193
我只是想到了件案子 
It's just that I was thinking of this case 

165
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:24,633
有这么一个不像话的父亲 虐待自己的女儿们
of a man who treated his daughters appallingly.

166
00:09:24,673 --> 00:09:29,473
他的长女 算是解开枷锁 
But when the eldest steeled herself to... cut the knot, so to speak,

167
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:31,610
让她的妹妹们重获自由
in order that her sisters might go free, 

168
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:34,233
然后她去投案自首 被判了绞刑
she gave herself up and was hanged.

169
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,433
玛格丽特・利奇菲尔德
Margaret Litchfield.

170
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:39,073
是的 你怎么知道
Yes. How did you know?

171
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:41,513
这是轰动一时的案子
Oh... It is a case most famous.

172
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:43,193
我觉得她非常勇敢
Well, I think she was very brave.

173
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,073
那富兰克林医师 他怎么觉得
And Dr Franklin, what does he think?

174
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:47,113
他觉得那个老人是自作自受
He thinks it served the old man right.

175
00:09:47,793 --> 00:09:49,793
有些人被谋杀纯属是自找的
Some people just ask to be murdered.

176
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,749
谋杀从来就不是正义的 朱蒂丝 
Murder is never justified, Judith. 

177
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,553
但在这么一个极端情况下...
But when a situation is so extreme...

178
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,873
这些想法都是谁灌输给你的
Who has been putting into your head these ideas?

179
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:59,113
- 没有谁 - 一派胡言
- Nobody. - Pernicious nonsense!

180
00:10:02,473 --> 00:10:05,273
其实我过来是为了给富兰克林夫人捎个口信
Actually, I came over to give you a message from Mrs Franklin.

181
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,193
她邀你去她房间
She's invited you to her room.

182
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,993
失陪了
Excuse me.

183
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:12,033
我就没懂过那姑娘
I've never understood that girl.

184
00:10:12,073 --> 00:10:15,913
她活出了自我 是个好姑娘 黑斯廷斯
Oh, she is her own woman, and a good one too, Hastings.

185
00:10:15,953 --> 00:10:18,233
但是她现在变得如此冷血
But she's become so cold-hearted.

186
00:10:18,913 --> 00:10:21,293
我觉得责任在她身边的人
I put it down to the company she keeps - 

187
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:22,833
那个可鄙的富兰克林医师
that wretched Dr Franklin.

188
00:10:25,113 --> 00:10:28,113
还有阿勒顿 我不喜欢那个人
And Allerton. I don't like that man.

189
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:30,873
这就是你们所谓的纨绔子弟 是吧
What you call the nasty bit of goods, eh?

190
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:34,593
- 但是很招姑娘们喜欢 - 向来如此
- But most attractive to the ladies. - Isn't that always the way?

191
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:43,593
您能来真是太好了 黑斯廷斯上校
I'm delighted you're here, Captain Hastings.

192
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:46,113
波罗先生一定高兴坏了
Dear Monsieur Poirot must be so pleased.

193
00:10:46,153 --> 00:10:48,206
还是宝刀未老啊 波罗 
Sharp as a knife, old Poirot, 

194
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:50,633
虽然他的身体已经不堪一击了
even though he is falling to bits.

195
00:10:50,673 --> 00:10:53,495
对朱蒂丝来说也是件大好事 
And it will be so nice for Judith. 

196
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:55,233
这孩子干活太拼了
The child has been working far too hard.

197
00:10:55,273 --> 00:10:56,800
她看起来气色不错啊 
She looks very well on it. 

198
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:58,073
我真是太羡慕她了
Oh, how I envy her.

199
00:10:59,073 --> 00:11:01,473
疾病于我如同跗骨之蛆啊
Ill health has been the bane of my life.

200
00:11:02,273 --> 00:11:04,313
枕头 克拉文
Pillows, Craven.

201
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:08,033
我丈夫特别擅长奴役别人 是吧约翰
Yes, my husband's a real slave driver. Aren't you, John?

202
00:11:08,073 --> 00:11:11,713
你刚说什么 芭芭拉
Mm? What's that, Barbara?

203
00:11:11,753 --> 00:11:15,353
她刚才说你成天使唤可怜的朱蒂丝
She was just saying how you work poor Judith into the ground.

204
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:17,073
朱蒂丝 是啊
Judith, yes.

205
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:20,313
我们还有些事情需要... 抱歉
There was something we had to... Do excuse me.

206
00:11:22,793 --> 00:11:25,073
我觉得自己真是不中用
Oh, I feel so inadequate.

207
00:11:26,113 --> 00:11:28,226
我知道自己应该更关心一点
I know I ought to take more interest. 

208
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:29,753
你不该自寻烦恼 芭布斯
You shouldn't worry yourself, Babs.

209
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:33,116
但是我觉得这太恶心了 
But I find it all so nasty, 

210
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:35,673
白老鼠啊兔子啊之类的
the guinea pigs and the rats and everything.

211
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:37,713
直叫我反胃
It makes me feel quite sick.

212
00:11:38,473 --> 00:11:41,233
我只愿想着可爱的叫人开心的东西
I just want to think about lovely, happy things.

213
00:11:41,953 --> 00:11:45,033
我和芭布斯是青梅竹马 虽然她小了我十五岁
Babs and I are old playmates, even though she's 15 years younger.

214
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:46,553
比尔亲爱的
Darling Bill.

215
00:11:46,593 --> 00:11:48,954
然后等我从缅甸回来的时候 
Then when I came back from Burma 

216
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:50,953
她已经出落成婷婷少女了
to find her a beautiful young lady.

217
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:53,313
我们家之前住在这附近
My family used to live in this part of the world

218
00:11:53,353 --> 00:11:56,273
比尔会不时来奈顿公馆他叔叔家住
and Bill would come to stay with his uncle at Knatton Hall.

219
00:11:56,313 --> 00:11:58,553
死气沉沉的地方
A mausoleum of a place.

220
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,433
需要女主人的打理
Needs a woman's hand.

221
00:12:04,153 --> 00:12:07,233
我不介意说给你听 当时我的心完全沦陷了
I don't mind telling you I completely lost my heart,

222
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:09,473
但是她离我而去 嫁给了富兰克林
but she went and married Franklin.

223
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:11,633
这人完全不懂她
The fellow doesn't understand her.

224
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:14,673
他只在意他的那些试管 蠢货
He's only interested in his test tubes, damned fool!

225
00:12:15,713 --> 00:12:17,793
来打局牌吧
Fancy a rubber?

226
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,473
该出红心 你个傻瓜
Hearts, you stupid man!

227
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:32,913
这没得打了 我们得重新开局
Oh, there's nothing for it, we'll have to start again.

228
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:36,553
我不知道自己是怎么了 整个人七上八下的
I don't know what's got into me. I'm all at sixes and sevens.

229
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:42,313
我们还没切牌呢
We haven't cut yet!

230
00:12:42,353 --> 00:12:46,233
抱歉 亲爱的 太对不起了
Oh, I'm sorry, dear. I'm so sorry.

231
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:57,433
这真是太过 过分了
Well, that was pretty g-ghastly.

232
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:01,574
看他被这么欺负 我实在是忍不下去了 
It gets my back up to see him b-bullied like that. 

233
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:02,313
小声点
Keep it down.

234
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:04,626
但这太 太恶劣了 真的太恶劣了 
But it's too b-bad, it really is. 

235
00:13:04,627 --> 00:13:06,473
更糟的是 他还忍 忍气吞声
And what's worse, he just t-takes it.

236
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:09,433
不过就算想反抗 他也无能为力
Couldn't assert himself if he tried.

237
00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:14,033
我们是不是该关上门
Oughtn't we to shut that?

238
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:16,873
好像还有人在外面
Ah, I d-don't think everybody's in yet.

239
00:13:16,913 --> 00:13:18,486
谁还在外面 
Who's still out? 

240
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:21,633
应该是你女 女儿 还有阿勒顿
Your d-daughter, I think, and Allerton.

241
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:56,713
- 还没睡啊 老伙计 - 我睡不着
- Still about, old chap? - I couldn't sleep.

242
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,113
我想找波罗拿点药
I was going to get some pills from Poirot.

243
00:13:59,993 --> 00:14:02,833
我来给你
Oh. I'll fix you up.

244
00:14:02,873 --> 00:14:04,913
不用去吵醒他
No need to wake him.

245
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:15,953
你经常这么晚睡吗
Do you normally stay up this late?

246
00:14:15,993 --> 00:14:18,993
外面有快乐的事情时 我可不会早睡
I never go to bed when there's sport abroad.

247
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:22,953
这种月光下的良宵不应该被虚度
These moonlit evenings aren't made to be wasted.

248
00:14:25,713 --> 00:14:27,753
这种药的药效很强
This is the real stuff.

249
00:14:27,793 --> 00:14:29,953
它会让你睡得像根木头一样
It'll make you sleep like a log.

250
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:32,633
"安眠" 这药危险吗
Slumberyl. Is it dangerous?

251
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:35,913
过量的话才会 这是一种巴比妥类药物
It is if you take too much of it. It's one of the barbiturates.

252
00:14:35,953 --> 00:14:38,229
开这种药不需要处方吗 
Don't you need a prescription? 

253
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,713
确实需要 但我有门路
Damned right, but I've got a pull in that line.

254
00:14:40,753 --> 00:14:43,593
是我的一个老朋友给我介绍的
An old friend of mine gave me a few useful introductions.

255
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,553
很不幸他已经去世了 那家伙叫埃瑟林顿
Dead now, sadly. Chap called Etherington.

256
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:48,713
莱昂纳多・埃瑟林顿
Leonard Etherington?

257
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:50,593
就是他
That's the one.

258
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:53,593
他的妻子 谁能想到她有那个东西
That wife of his. Who'd have thought she'd have it in her?

259
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:57,233
- 砒霜 对吗 - 对 你也认识他吧
- Arsenic, wasn't it? - Yes. Knew him too, did you?

260
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:59,073
不 我在报纸上看到的
No, I read about it.

261
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:00,953
这样啊
I see.

262
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:03,068
他很风趣 虽然谈不上品行端正 
Funny chap, but good company... 

263
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,313
但有时候也算谈得来
in small doses.

264
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:07,793
睡个好觉
Sleep well.

265
00:15:12,753 --> 00:15:16,153
这是卡拉巴豆 又叫做毒扁豆  
This is the Calabar bean. Physostigma venenosum.

266
00:15:16,193 --> 00:15:18,347
我最近在用它里面提取出来的
I've been experimenting with various 

267
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:19,673
各种生物碱做实验
alkaloids derived from it.

268
00:15:19,713 --> 00:15:22,393
话说 波罗 这种东西真的更合你的胃口
You know, Poirot, this stuff's really more up your street than mine.

269
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:23,833
为什么 我的朋友
How is that, mon ami?

270
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:26,299
因为它还叫做"考验豆" 
Well, you see, it's also called the ordeal bean, 

271
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,353
可以被用来证明是否清白
supposed to prove innocence or guilt.

272
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:30,193
你不喜欢老鼠吗 父亲
Don't you like rats, father?

273
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,073
我肯定不喜欢阿勒顿
I certainly don't like Allerton.

274
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:33,633
原来是这样
So that's it.

275
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:35,513
我想你也不会喜欢他吧
And I suspect you don't either.

276
00:15:35,553 --> 00:15:36,972
我为什么不能喜欢他 
Why shouldn't I like him? 

277
00:15:36,973 --> 00:15:38,273
他不是你喜欢的类型
He's not your type.

278
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,153
那我喜欢什么类型
And what is my type?

279
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,313
你根本不知道 是吧
You have no idea, have you?

280
00:15:43,353 --> 00:15:45,713
实际上 我觉得他很有趣
Well, as it happens, I find him most amusing.

281
00:15:45,753 --> 00:15:46,593
确实有趣 
Amusing, yes. 

282
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:48,633
并且很迷人 任何女人都会喜欢他
And very attractive. Any woman would.

283
00:15:48,673 --> 00:15:50,633
- 问题就出在这里 - 别闹了 父亲
- That's the trouble. - Really, father!

284
00:15:50,673 --> 00:15:52,753
你昨晚和他在外面呆到很晚
You were out with him very late last night.

285
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:56,113
- 这和你有什么关系 - 这真是有趣
- What has that to do with you? - This is most interesting.

286
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:59,043
如果真能这么轻易地检验出
I would find it a great help 

287
00:15:59,044 --> 00:16:00,393
有罪或者无辜 我就轻松多了
if I could test so easily the guilt or innocence.

288
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:01,723
不过之后的问题就是 
Then you have to ask, 

289
00:16:01,724 --> 00:16:03,273
究竟怎么才算有罪或无辜呢
what is guilt or innocence?

290
00:16:03,313 --> 00:16:05,599
要我说这很明显 
Pretty obvious, I'd say. 

291
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,233
要杀人的话就会感觉到自己有罪
One would always feel guilt when it comes to murder.

292
00:16:07,273 --> 00:16:09,793
你这么认为吗 外面有很多人我都想杀掉
You think so? There are lots of people I'd like to kill

293
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,833
而我的良心不会受到什么谴责
without my conscience being too much troubled.

294
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:15,873
我不喜欢小题大做
I do so hate making a fuss.

295
00:16:17,113 --> 00:16:19,616
我有时候觉得
I sometimes think...

296
00:16:19,617 --> 00:16:23,873
如果一个人病了 就应该安静地离去
if one isn't healthy, one should be quietly put away.

297
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:25,593
天呐 这样可不好 夫人
God, no, madame.

298
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:27,913
瞧瞧我 腿都跛了
Look at me, all cramped and twisted,

299
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,913
动也动不了
not able to move,

300
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:31,913
但我却没想过放弃生命
yet I do not think of quitting.

301
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:34,833
我仍尽力享受生活
I enjoy still what I can.

302
00:16:34,873 --> 00:16:37,593
但你只需要考虑自己
But you have only yourself to consider.

303
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:40,233
而我还有可怜的约翰呢
In my case, there's poor John.

304
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:43,673
我觉得自己就像拖累他的包袱
I feel such a millstone round his neck.

305
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:45,793
但我肯定他从没这么说过
But I'm sure he's never said such a thing.

306
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,913
这些科学家有时会非常沉迷于他们的工作
These scientist chaps can get quite obsessive about their work.

307
00:16:49,953 --> 00:16:52,913
完全正确 有时候 波罗先生
Absolutely. Sometimes, Monsieur Poirot,

308
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:56,153
我觉得我能听见那些可怜的小生物
I think I can hear the poor little creatures 

309
00:16:56,154 --> 00:16:57,433
在夜晚的尖叫声
screaming in the night.

310
00:16:58,113 --> 00:16:59,265
真是很可怕 
Perfectly horrid. 

311
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:01,713
斯蒂文和我在这件事情上意见一致
Stephen and I are as one on this.

312
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:03,649
我有时会非常沮丧 
I can get so terribly depressed 

313
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,233
甚至会想 如果能够结束这一切才真是解脱
that I think what a relief it would be to end it all.

314
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:08,500
得了吧 女士 
Oh, come, madame. 

315
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:10,273
但是我对别人有什么用呢
But what use am I to anybody?

316
00:17:10,313 --> 00:17:13,513
踏进神秘的未知之地 
Oh, to step into the Great Unknown - 

317
00:17:13,514 --> 00:17:16,393
然后约翰就会自由了
and then John would be free.

318
00:17:17,393 --> 00:17:19,033
我去帮你拿麦芽牛奶
I'll fetch your malted milk.

319
00:17:19,073 --> 00:17:22,073
我和你一起走 黑斯廷斯
I will come with you. Hastings!

320
00:17:22,113 --> 00:17:24,513
夫人先生 再会
Madame, monsieur.

321
00:17:24,553 --> 00:17:25,880
你还好吗 老兄 
All right, old chap? 

322
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:27,473
是的 我需要休息一下
Yes, I need to rest.

323
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:31,633
我想你在一战时来过这里
I gather you were here in the first war.

324
00:17:31,673 --> 00:17:34,593
是的 在1916年 我来这里修养
Yes, in 1916. I came here to convalesce.

325
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,113
我就是在那时遇见的波罗
That's when I met Poirot.

326
00:17:36,153 --> 00:17:38,593
- 是不是有位老妇人被谋杀了 - 是的
- Didn't an old lady get murdered? - Oui.

327
00:17:39,353 --> 00:17:40,655
我曾经在一个家庭里服侍 
I was once in a house 

328
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:41,633
那里有过一件谋杀案
where there was a murder.

329
00:17:41,673 --> 00:17:44,433
她也是一位老妇人 我的一个病人
She was an old lady too - one of my patients.

330
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:47,873
那个案件不会就是关于夏尔普小姐的吧
It was not by any chance the case of Miss Sharples, was it?

331
00:17:47,913 --> 00:17:50,033
实际上 是的
Yes, it was, actually.

332
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:52,473
她的侄子弗雷达・克莱被控诉对她下毒
Her niece Freda Clay was accused of her poisoning

333
00:17:52,513 --> 00:17:54,833
但是证据不足 无法起诉
but there was evidence insufficient to prosecute.

334
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,253
你是怎么知道的 
How did you know? 

335
00:17:56,254 --> 00:17:59,153
我的工作就是要知道这些事情 克拉文护士
Oh, it is my job to know, Nurse Craven.

336
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:01,353
他总是能明察秋毫
He doesn't miss a trick.

337
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:11,793
该死的鸽子 它们会造成许多损害
Blasted pigeons. They do a lot of damage, you know.

338
00:18:12,673 --> 00:18:14,553
托比一直是个好射手
Toby's always been a fine shot.

339
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,993
我曾经是的
Oh... I used to be.

340
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:18,564
我过去在印度时 
You know, I often used to think of evenings 

341
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:19,713
常常想象这样的黄昏
like this back in India,

342
00:18:19,753 --> 00:18:23,153
但事实和想象的差别很大
but nothing's ever quite as you picture it.

343
00:18:23,193 --> 00:18:27,153
不知道为什么 我忽然很渴
I don't know why, but I've got quite a thirst on.

344
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:29,433
我请你们喝一杯吧 怎么样
Oh. Why don't you have a drink on the house? What d'you say?

345
00:18:29,473 --> 00:18:31,673
好主意
Splendid idea!

346
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:36,353
- 你去过热带吗 诺顿 - 没 没有 
- Have you done the tropics, Norton? - No. No, er...

347
00:18:36,393 --> 00:18:40,353
我 我们...我母亲不让我离开
W-W... My hands were t-tied with mother.

348
00:18:41,873 --> 00:18:43,753
你还好吗 伙计
You all right, old chap?

349
00:18:43,793 --> 00:18:45,753
我受 受不了 了血
Can't s-s-st-stand b-blood.

350
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:47,273
你会习惯的
You'll get used to it.

351
00:18:47,313 --> 00:18:49,073
没什么比猎获几只鸟 
Nothing like bagging a few birds 

352
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:50,833
打几只兔子更有趣了 是吧 黑斯廷斯
and blasting the odd bunny, eh, Hastings?

353
00:18:50,873 --> 00:18:52,137
真是有意思 
Darn good fun. 

354
00:18:52,138 --> 00:18:54,193
你到底在做什么 托比
What on earth are you doing, Toby?

355
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,713
我只是想给朋友们喝一杯 
I just thought I'd give the fellows a snifter. 

356
00:18:56,714 --> 00:18:57,953
你不能这么做
You'll do no such thing!

357
00:18:57,993 --> 00:18:59,593
- 把那个瓶子给我 - 黛西
- Give that bottle to me! - Daisy...

358
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:01,381
如果你再请别人喝酒 
How do you think we'll ever 

359
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:04,353
这生意我们还怎么做下去
make this place pay if you keep standing people drinks?

360
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,753
他们只是老朋友 黛西
They're old friends, Daisy.

361
00:19:06,793 --> 00:19:08,953
锁起来 就应该这么做
Locked up! That's the way of it.

362
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:10,250
我不能容许这样 
I won't have it. 

363
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:12,513
你不容许 你是谁啊 我倒是想知道
You won't? Who are you, I'd like to know?

364
00:19:19,553 --> 00:19:21,673
我 我非常抱歉 伙计们
I'm... I'm awfully sorry, you chaps.

365
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:23,513
我们...
We...

366
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:25,504
威士忌好像喝完了 
We seem to have run out of whisky. 

367
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:27,633
反正我也没有那么渴
Do you know, I'm not that thirsty, anyway.

368
00:19:27,673 --> 00:19:29,713
我们马上就要用晚餐了
We'll soon be having dinner.

369
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,633
晚餐 是的
Oh, dinner, yes.

370
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:33,553
别担心 托比老兄 我们没事的
Don't worry, Toby, old chap. We'll live.

371
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:39,993
好了 先活动活动腿脚
Right. Stretch the old pins before mess call.

372
00:19:44,353 --> 00:19:47,273
- 他这家伙挺棒 对吗 - 对
- Splendid chap, isn't he? - Yes.

373
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:51,313
不管他做什么 总是很成功
Whatever he turns his hand to, always makes a success of it.

374
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:52,585
有的人总是非常幸运 
Some chaps have all the luck. 

375
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:54,433
他现在就少一个妻子了
All he needs now is a wife.

376
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:56,993
只要她不欺负他就行
So long as she doesn't b-bully him.

377
00:19:57,033 --> 00:19:58,953
他不会被欺负的
He won't get bullied.

378
00:19:58,993 --> 00:20:01,073
他不会允许自己被欺负
He wouldn't let himself.

379
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:04,593
- 那有只该死的兔子 - 有吗
- There's a damned rabbit! - Is there?

380
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:07,553
在那里咬树皮 我早该把这个地方圈起来
Nibbling at the bark. I thought I'd wired the place.

381
00:20:12,553 --> 00:20:13,793
我的天啊
My God!

382
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:25,033
去叫富兰克林
Get Franklin!

383
00:20:26,873 --> 00:20:28,993
没事的 勒特雷尔夫人
It's all right, Mrs Luttrell.

384
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,913
没事的 没事
It's all right. That's it.

385
00:20:32,953 --> 00:20:34,273
会好的
It's fine.

386
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:55,493
富兰克林正在给黛西治疗 她会没事的
Franklin's seeing Daisy. She's going to be fine.

387
00:20:56,293 --> 00:20:58,333
你认为他是故意的吗
Do you think he did it on purpose?

388
00:20:58,373 --> 00:21:00,753
我曾这么想过 但看到他们在一起之后 
Well, I did until I saw them together. 

389
00:21:00,754 --> 00:21:01,733
我现在不确定了
Now I'm not so sure.

390
00:21:01,773 --> 00:21:04,213
可怜的老勒特雷尔
Poor old Luttrell.

391
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:08,573
我想黛西是个好人 但一个人是有极限的
I mean Daisy's a good sort, I suppose, but a chap can only take so much.

392
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:11,013
打完桥牌之后 诺顿多了几句嘴
After the bridge, Norton actually said as much.

393
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:13,213
我确定勒特雷尔都听到了
I'm sure Luttrell heard every word.

394
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:16,773
凶手在这里 我就知道
The killer is here! I know it!

395
00:21:16,813 --> 00:21:19,533
- 你怎么知道 - 我就是知道
- How do you know? - I know!

396
00:21:19,573 --> 00:21:22,581
勒特雷尔冲着他的妻子开枪 
Whether Luttrell shot his wife by accident 

397
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:26,053
是意外还是故意的 这个很难证明
or whether he meant to...it is impossible to prove.

398
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:27,933
你能够证明
Oh, you'll prove it all right.

399
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:29,325
你总是可以 
You always do. 

400
00:21:29,326 --> 00:21:31,693
如果人生有这么简单就好了
If only life were that simple.

401
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:35,733
波罗总是能抓到凶手
Poirot always gets his man.

402
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:37,933
或许这一次他不想这么做
Perhaps this time he does not wish to.

403
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:40,493
你把我弄糊涂了 老兄
You've lost me there, old chap.

404
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,053
除非是
Unless, of course...

405
00:21:43,013 --> 00:21:44,708
有人躲在灌木丛中 
..someone was hiding in the bushes, 

406
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:47,533
就在上校开火的同时 他也开火了
and at the exact moment the colonel fired, they fired too.

407
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,274
那个藏在灌木丛中的神秘杀手
And who might be this mystery killer 

408
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:50,453
会是谁呢 黑斯廷斯
in the bushes, Hastings?

409
00:21:50,493 --> 00:21:53,653
我觉得是那个吸毒成瘾的罗萨里奥・阿勒顿
I wouldn't put it past that drug-addled Lothario Allerton.

410
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:54,334
吸毒成瘾 
Drug-addled? 

411
00:21:54,335 --> 00:21:55,893
他曾是莱昂纳多・埃瑟林顿的密友
He was a chum of Leonard Etherington.

412
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:58,573
那个被妻子毒死的瘾君子
That addict who was poisoned by his wife.

413
00:21:58,613 --> 00:22:00,653
- 你怎么知道的 - 他告诉我的
- How do you know this? - He told me.

414
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:03,013
你就没想过要告诉我吗
And you did not think to tell it to me?

415
00:22:04,213 --> 00:22:05,986
黑斯廷斯 你的问题就在于
The trouble with you, Hastings, 

416
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:07,613
你太懒了 精神上太懒了
is that you are lazy - mentally.

417
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:09,348
听着 波罗 我知道我不是个聪明人 
Listen, Poirot. Look, I know I'm not much of a fellow 

418
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:10,573
但你也没必要揭我的伤疤
but there's no need to rub it in.

419
00:22:10,613 --> 00:22:12,733
你不喜欢用脑子来工作
You do not like to work with this.

420
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:15,493
或许你应该让别人帮忙 比如波伊德・卡灵顿
Perhaps you should get someone else on board. Boyd Carrington.

421
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:17,653
- 当然不行 - 他比我可聪明多了
- Certainly not. - He's a good deal cleverer than me.

422
00:22:17,693 --> 00:22:18,653
那倒是不难 
That would not be difficult. 

423
00:22:18,654 --> 00:22:20,333
但是波伊德・卡灵顿...
But Boyd Carrington...

424
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:22,613
是个爱炫耀的讨厌鬼 他的记忆力太差了
Is a pompous bore, whose memory is so bad

425
00:22:22,653 --> 00:22:25,933
他会把你讲给他的故事再讲给你听
that he tells back to you the story that you have told to him!

426
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:30,693
我禁止你向任何人说起这件事情
Now, I forbid you to speak of this matter to anyone.

427
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:32,693
- 你明白吗 - 是的
- Do you understand? - Yes.

428
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:36,773
我只能靠你跟着别人去我去不了的地方
It is up to you to follow people where I cannot go,

429
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,567
跟他们谈话 打探他们 监视他们 
to talk to them, to listen to them, to spy on them, 

430
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:40,773
通过钥匙孔偷看
watch through keyholes.

431
00:22:40,813 --> 00:22:42,493
我不会通过钥匙孔偷看
I will not look through keyholes.

432
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:46,133
好吧 好吧 你不用通过钥匙孔偷看
Oh, very well, very well, you will not look through keyholes.

433
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:50,253
你继续做你的英国绅士 然后有人会被杀死的
You will remain the English gentleman and someone will be killed.

434
00:22:50,293 --> 00:22:52,213
真见鬼 波罗
Oh, dash it all, Poirot.

435
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:57,173
你有的时候真是顽固 你知道吗 黑斯廷斯
You can be quite obstinate at times. Do you know that, Hastings?

436
00:22:58,933 --> 00:23:01,893
我也希望还有其他我可以信赖的人
I also wish there was someone else I could trust...

437
00:23:02,853 --> 00:23:05,333
但是我想我只能忍受你了
..but I suppose I will have to put up with you.

438
00:23:05,373 --> 00:23:07,851
因为你根本没有灰色脑细胞
And since you cannot use your little grey cells 

439
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:09,173
也不能强迫你用它
because you do not possess them,

440
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:10,663
但无论如何用用你的眼睛 
at any rate use your eyes, 

441
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:12,773
你的耳朵 你的鼻子 如果需要的话
your ears, your nose, if need be.

442
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:17,853
当然 在尊严允许的范围内
But only, of course, as far as the dictates of honour will allow.

443
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:23,613
现在走吧
Now go away.

444
00:23:24,253 --> 00:23:26,333
我很累了
I'm very tired.

445
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:44,773
又来了 你又在
At it again, are you...

446
00:23:44,774 --> 00:23:47,533
练习杀人游戏了吗
at your deadly exercise?

447
00:23:49,973 --> 00:23:52,133
我知道你会的
I knew you would be.

448
00:23:52,893 --> 00:23:54,973
为了我的罪恶 我知道你会的
For my sins, I knew you would.

449
00:23:56,733 --> 00:24:00,693
但只要我一息尚存 我就会...
But while I have breath in my body, I will...

450
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:32,413
我就会诅咒你下地狱
I will damn you to hell...

451
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,493
不计一切代价
..whatever the cost.

452
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:47,453
他看起来不太高兴
He doesn't look too happy.

453
00:24:47,493 --> 00:24:49,293
他确实不高兴
He isn't.

454
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,893
他曾有机会前往非洲
He was offered the chance to go to Africa,

455
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:55,413
继续他的研究 但是他妻子坚决不同意
to continue his research, but his wife protested.

456
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,013
他或许不忍心离开她
He probably felt he couldn't leave her.

457
00:24:58,053 --> 00:24:59,773
你很了解她吗 上校
Do you know much about her, Captain?

458
00:24:59,813 --> 00:25:01,872
我只知道她体弱多病 
Only that she's an invalid. 

459
00:25:01,873 --> 00:25:03,773
她以生病为乐呢
She certainly enjoys ill health.

460
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:07,533
所以你认为她的病没那么严重
So you don't think there's very much the matter?

461
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:10,173
她似乎总是能够如愿以偿
She always seems to be able to do anything she wants.

462
00:25:10,213 --> 00:25:12,373
你和富兰克林夫妇很熟吗
You know the Franklins well, do you?

463
00:25:12,413 --> 00:25:14,133
没有
Er...no.

464
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,693
我刚才说的话 都是从你女儿那里听到的
What I've told you I learnt from your daughter.

465
00:25:18,373 --> 00:25:20,453
她在竭力支持他
She's up in arms on his behalf.

466
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,733
你觉得诺顿先生怎么样
What do you think of Mr Norton?

467
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:27,053
- 为什么这么问 - 你们关系好像不错
- Why do you ask? - You seem to get on well.

468
00:25:28,773 --> 00:25:31,613
我们有很多共同点
We have a good deal in common,

469
00:25:31,653 --> 00:25:36,293
他非常善良 虽然...不是很机灵
and he's awfully kind, if a little...ineffectual.

470
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,613
他是个斯文的人
No, he's a gentle soul.

471
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:41,573
他和他母亲住了很多年 她非常专横
He lived with his mother for many years - she was very bossy -

472
00:25:41,613 --> 00:25:44,813
而且我想他在学校里过得也不太好
and I don't think he had a very good time at school either.

473
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:49,053
他的感觉很敏锐
He's very perceptive, you know.

474
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:52,533
安静的人一般都这样
Quiet people often are.

475
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:53,733
是的
Yes.

476
00:25:53,773 --> 00:25:58,053
所以这样的地方才阴沉沉的
That's the depressing thing about places like this.

477
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,373
聚集着失败者
It's full of failures.

478
00:26:01,413 --> 00:26:03,813
我想是因为又经历了一场战争
I suppose it's having endured another war.

479
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,373
我们都曾有过创伤
We've all had the stuffing knocked out of us.

480
00:26:07,293 --> 00:26:10,509
你参与过很多军事行动吗 黑斯廷斯上校 
Did you see much action, Captain Hastings? 

481
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,533
现在不行了
Oh, not allowed to this time round.

482
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:15,413
腿脚不好了 而且实话说 我也有点放任
Gammy leg. And, let's face it, I'm pushing it a bit.

483
00:26:17,093 --> 00:26:19,133
但你的人生才刚开始
But your life's just beginning.

484
00:26:19,173 --> 00:26:21,333
一切皆有可能
Anything might happen.

485
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:27,053
如果你在说婚姻的话 我从不敢去想
If you mean marriage, I could never think of it. 

486
00:26:27,054 --> 00:26:28,493
因为我的过去
Not with my history.

487
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,613
什么意思
What do you mean?

488
00:26:32,293 --> 00:26:35,333
你不知道我是谁吧
You have no idea who I am, have you?

489
00:26:35,373 --> 00:26:36,933
我知道你的名字
I know your name.

490
00:26:37,653 --> 00:26:40,093
我不叫科尔 而是利奇菲尔德 
It isn't Cole. It's Litchfield.

491
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:41,599
马修・利奇菲尔德 
Matthew Litchfield. 

492
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,933
是的 他是我父亲
Yes. He was my father.

493
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:46,413
他是个恶棍 黑斯廷斯上校
A wicked man, Captain Hastings.

494
00:26:47,453 --> 00:26:48,481
他一直囚禁着我们 
He was our jailer 

495
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:49,853
直到我姐姐玛格丽特...
until my sister Margaret...

496
00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:52,035
是的 我知道 报纸上都登了 
Yes, I know. It was in all the papers. 

497
00:26:52,036 --> 00:26:52,973
但你不知道
But you don't.

498
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:58,453
我不相信是她杀了他
It's inconceivable she'd murder him.

499
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:02,013
我知道她投案自首了 但是...
I know she gave herself up, but...

500
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:07,173
我总觉得这不对劲
...I've always felt it wasn't true.

501
00:27:08,213 --> 00:27:10,293
不是玛格丽特干的
It wasn't Margaret.

502
00:27:11,293 --> 00:27:13,453
不可能
It can't have been.

503
00:27:26,413 --> 00:27:27,681
早上好 先生们
Good morning, gentlemen. 

504
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:29,373
早上好 富兰克林夫人
Good morning, Mrs Franklin.

505
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:31,351
你今天心情很好啊 夫人 
You sound very happy today, madame. 

506
00:27:31,352 --> 00:27:33,013
是啊 是啊 波罗先生
I am. I am, Monsieur Poirot.

507
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:36,779
我要和威廉姆爵士
I'm going on a little outing with Sir William 

508
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,213
去奈顿公馆帮他选窗帘
to Knatton Hall to advise him on his cretonnes.

509
00:27:38,253 --> 00:27:41,070
我太笨了 昨天和约翰说话的时候
Silly me left my handbag in the studio yesterday 

510
00:27:41,071 --> 00:27:42,573
把包落在工作室了
when I was talking to John.

511
00:27:42,613 --> 00:27:45,533
- 我太健忘了 - 富兰克林医师去哪里了
- Head like a sieve. Where is Dr Franklin?

512
00:27:45,573 --> 00:27:47,500
他和朱蒂丝去塔明斯特
He and Judith have driven into Tadminster 

513
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,813
买化学药品和其他一些东西
for some chemical or other.

514
00:27:50,813 --> 00:27:53,053
我真为自己没有一个科研头脑感到庆幸
I'm so glad I don't have a scientific mind.

515
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:56,093
在这样好的天气 那种行为多么幼稚
On a day like this, it all seems so puerile.

516
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:59,053
别让科学家们听到你说的这些 夫人
Do not let the scientists hear you say that, madame.

517
00:27:59,093 --> 00:28:03,053
不 你不要以为我不欣赏我的丈夫 先生
Oh. Oh, you mustn't think I don't admire my husband, monsieur.

518
00:28:03,093 --> 00:28:05,853
他对工作那是殚精竭虑
The way he lives for his work is really tremendous,

519
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:09,973
但我也怕他陷得太深而无法自拔
but it makes me nervous the lengths to which he might go.

520
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:12,213
你这话是什么意思 夫人
What exactly do you mean, madame?

521
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:16,693
就是那毒扁豆的事情
Well, this horrible Calabar bean thing.

522
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:20,453
我很担心他会在自己身上做实验
I'm so afraid he's going to start experimenting on himself.

523
00:28:20,493 --> 00:28:24,693
他只能在动物身上研究到这么多
You see, he can only learn so much from animals.

524
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:26,853
他一定会做好一切预防措施
He'd take every precaution, surely.

525
00:28:26,893 --> 00:28:31,253
你不了解约翰 他根本不注意自己的安全
Oh, you don't know John. Absolutely oblivious of his own safety.

526
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:34,213
他真是一个圣人
He really is a sort of saint.

527
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:37,693
- 准备好了吗 宝贝 - 不能让男爵久等
- You ready, Babs? - Oh. Mustn't keep the baronet waiting.

528
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:44,053
富兰克林医师 当代圣人
Dr Franklin, the modern saint.

529
00:28:44,093 --> 00:28:46,093
她听风就是雨
She's a feather for every wind.

530
00:28:46,133 --> 00:28:49,853
你觉得她是个傻瓜吗 黑斯廷斯
You think she is a fool, do you not, Hastings?

531
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:51,829
她反正不是最聪明的人 
Well, she's not the most brilliant intellect. 

532
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,213
先是她的包 现在又忘了手套
First her handbag, now her gloves.

533
00:28:54,253 --> 00:28:56,733
真不知道那姑娘怎么能受得了她
I don't know how that girl puts up with it.

534
00:29:00,853 --> 00:29:03,573
就差一点啊
It was so close! Wasn't it?

535
00:29:10,173 --> 00:29:13,053
我...发现 上校 
I...can't help noticing, Captain, 

536
00:29:13,054 --> 00:29:15,933
你看起来有点心神不宁
that you're looking a little uneasy.

537
00:29:16,813 --> 00:29:21,693
- 是吗 - 我不得不说 我也很不安
- Am I? - And I have to say, well, I'd feel the same way.

538
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:26,453
世道总在变 不是吗
Things change all the time, don't they?

539
00:29:26,493 --> 00:29:28,925
女孩们现在更加自由独立了 
Girls are more independent now. 

540
00:29:28,926 --> 00:29:31,733
我想很大程度上是因为战争的关系
I suppose the w-war had a lot to do with that.

541
00:29:32,693 --> 00:29:34,733
你想说什么 诺顿
What are you trying to say, Norton?

542
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:39,333
别想太多 但是...
...don't let it go further, but...

543
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:43,093
一遇到年轻姑娘
...when it comes to young women,

544
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:47,173
阿勒顿就特别会耍花样
Allerton has rather a special t-technique in that line.

545
00:29:49,853 --> 00:29:53,573
事实上 我碰巧知道一些他的丑事
I happen to know something pretty f-foul about him, actually.

546
00:29:53,613 --> 00:29:55,733
什么事
And what would that be?

547
00:29:57,173 --> 00:30:00,973
不久以前 我听说一个像朱蒂丝那样的女孩
Not long ago, I heard of a girl just like Judith...

548
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:03,996
时髦 独立
modern, independent...

549
00:30:03,997 --> 00:30:06,813
掉入了少校的温柔乡
falling prey to the major's charms.

550
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:10,037
他得手之后 
Once he'd got her in his clutches, 

551
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:13,493
就在她最脆弱的时候
just when she was at her most v-vulnerable,

552
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:16,693
抛弃了她 她很绝望
he abandoned her, leaving her d-desperate.

553
00:30:17,493 --> 00:30:20,093
因为伤心欲绝
So d-devastated was she...

554
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:23,973
她自杀了
...she took her own life.

555
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:26,493
吃了大量安眠药
An overdose of Veronal.

556
00:30:44,053 --> 00:30:46,013
可怜的老妇人
Poor old woman.

557
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,533
痛苦不堪
Devilish pain.

558
00:30:47,573 --> 00:30:50,013
过量服用吗啡要了她的性命 
Overdose of morphia finished her off 

559
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,453
她的侄女弗雷达说是一个疏忽
and her niece, Freda, said it was a slip-up.

560
00:30:52,493 --> 00:30:56,333
警察不这么认为 但没有足够证据来起诉
The police had other ideas but didn't have enough evidence to prosecute.

561
00:30:56,373 --> 00:30:58,493
你认识她 对吗 弗雷达・克莱
You knew her, did you, Freda Clay?

562
00:30:58,533 --> 00:30:59,693
是的
Yes.

563
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:02,253
我只是以前听过这个事情
It is just that I have heard this story before.

564
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:05,013
我也听过 还是一个在现场的人告诉我的 
So have I, from someone who was there, actually.

565
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:06,933
是吗
Ah, have you?

566
00:31:06,973 --> 00:31:09,173
报纸上都登了
It was in all the papers.

567
00:31:10,293 --> 00:31:13,413
我脑子有时候 不太灵光
Get a bit erm...fuddled in the old brain-box sometimes.

568
00:31:13,453 --> 00:31:16,293
比尔 你能说点开心的事吗
Oh, Bill, can't you think of anything jollier to talk about?

569
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,893
我想波罗先生一定都吃得倒牙了
I'm sure Monsieur Poirot is fed up to the back teeth

570
00:31:18,933 --> 00:31:22,413
听你们讨论这些杀人 死亡和凶手的事
with people killing and dying and who did what and why.

571
00:31:22,453 --> 00:31:25,653
她倒会让我们保持警惕 对吧 富兰克林
She certainly keeps us on our toes, eh, Franklin?

572
00:31:25,693 --> 00:31:27,693
正合我意
Just the ticket.

573
00:31:27,733 --> 00:31:29,275
不过确实有过报道
They do say, don't they, 

574
00:31:29,276 --> 00:31:30,973
说有些男人想娶自己的妈妈
that men tend to marry their mothers?

575
00:31:31,013 --> 00:31:32,573
我不太确定
I'm not quite sure about that.

576
00:31:32,613 --> 00:31:35,013
最好问诺顿 他是专家
Better ask Norton. He's the expert.

577
00:31:35,053 --> 00:31:37,773
大家都来了
A full complement!

578
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,293
真是荣幸 对吗 托比
What a treat! Isn't it, Toby?

579
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:40,973
是的 我的宝贝
Yes, my sweet.

580
00:31:41,013 --> 00:31:44,173
你可是为我们的晚餐增色不少 波罗先生
Our little dinners are not the same without you, Monsieur Poirot.

581
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:46,733
是的 我不想让你总一个人吃饭
No. I don't like the thought of your eating alone.

582
00:31:46,773 --> 00:31:50,893
我这个人不喜欢错过任何事 亲爱的
I myself do not like to miss anything, mon cher.

583
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:53,453
从来都没从工作中抽身休息一下
Never a m-moment's rest in your line of work.

584
00:31:53,493 --> 00:31:57,173
没有 诺顿先生 总有做不完的事情
No, no, Monsieur Norton, there is always still so much more to do...

585
00:31:58,413 --> 00:32:00,933
但时间不多了 对吗
...but the clock it ticks. Non?

586
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,933
这是上帝的意志
Such is the will of God.

587
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:07,653
我们都会想念你的 老朋友 你会被永远铭记
We'll all miss you, old chap, but you won't be forgotten.

588
00:32:12,493 --> 00:32:14,685
葡萄酒真不错 但我的意思是... 
Damn good claret. But my point is... 

589
00:32:14,686 --> 00:32:15,453
得了 比尔
Now, Bill.

590
00:32:15,493 --> 00:32:19,573
可以看出弗雷达的本意 是想让某人摆脱痛苦
You can see where Freda was coming from, putting somebody out of their misery.

591
00:32:19,613 --> 00:32:22,653
你们不觉得这样做应当经过病人的同意吗
Don't you think it should only be done with the patient's consent?

592
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:24,143
不能让病人来做决定
It can't be left to the patient. 

593
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:27,253
应该由爱他们的人来负起这个责任
It's the duty of someone who loves them to take responsibility.

594
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:29,101
最后却被指控谋杀吗
And end up being charged with murder? 

595
00:32:29,102 --> 00:32:31,813
如果你爱一个人 就得冒这个险
If you love someone, you'd take that risk.

596
00:32:31,853 --> 00:32:35,013
- 你会吗 - 是的 我会
- Would you? - Yes, I would.

597
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:39,573
我肯定不会 托比也不会 你会吗 亲爱的
Well, I certainly wouldn't, and neither would Toby, would you, dear?

598
00:32:39,613 --> 00:32:43,573
喝点水 就没事了
Sip of water. That'll shift it.

599
00:32:44,573 --> 00:32:47,813
不能让法律落入人们的掌控
You can't have people taking the law into their own hands.

600
00:32:47,853 --> 00:32:50,453
我很同意 你觉得呢 富兰克林
I quite agree. What about you, Franklin?

601
00:32:50,493 --> 00:32:52,213
- 什么 - 安乐死
- What? - Euthanasia.

602
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:54,413
你一定有自己的看法 你可是个医生
You must have an opinion. You're a doctor.

603
00:32:54,453 --> 00:32:56,973
抱歉 我走神了
Mm... Sorry. My mind was elsewhere.

604
00:32:57,013 --> 00:32:59,373
大多数人都没那个勇 勇气
Most people wouldn't have the n-nerve.

605
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:02,693
如果真到那一天 我不相信你会给人安乐死 
I don't believe you would if it came to it.

606
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:04,453
不会吗
Don't you?

607
00:33:04,493 --> 00:33:06,493
除非 当然 你另有企图
Unless, of course, you had an axe to grind.

608
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:09,253
你没明白我的意思 是吗
You don't understand, do you?

609
00:33:09,293 --> 00:33:10,936
如果只是为了达到个人目的的话 
Of course I couldn't 

610
00:33:10,937 --> 00:33:11,813
我当然不会这么做
if the motive was personal.

611
00:33:11,853 --> 00:33:14,387
即便不是 我也不相信
Even if it weren't, I'm not sure 

612
00:33:14,388 --> 00:33:17,133
你会真的扣动扳机 可以这么说
you would actually p-pull the trigger, so to speak.

613
00:33:17,173 --> 00:33:18,833
我们能说点别的吗 
Can't we talk about something else? 

614
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:20,493
同意 这些太可怕了
I agree. It's all far too grim.

615
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:22,853
我不像你们那样把生命看得那么神圣
I don't hold life as sacred as you people do.

616
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:26,413
不健康的生命 无用的生命 就该被除掉
Unfit lives, useless lives...they should be got out of the way.

617
00:33:26,453 --> 00:33:29,413
- 朱蒂丝 - 就应该 那真是一团糟
- Judith! - They should. There's so much mess about.

618
00:33:29,453 --> 00:33:31,529
她也许有点道理 
She might have a point. 

619
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,813
其实还是勇气的问题
It's really a question of  c-courage.

620
00:33:33,853 --> 00:33:36,693
说的粗俗些 有人有这个胆量吗
Does one have the g-guts, to put it vulgarly?

621
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:40,373
而且 黑斯廷斯小姐 我觉得你没有
And you see, Miss Hastings, but I don't believe you have.

622
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:42,173
朱蒂丝还是有胆量的
Oh, Judith's got guts all right.

623
00:33:43,413 --> 00:33:46,093
我有超出你的想象的勇气 诺顿先生
A lot more than you think, Mr Norton.

624
00:33:53,373 --> 00:33:55,373
失陪了
Excuse me.

625
00:33:59,173 --> 00:34:00,813
朱蒂丝
Judith!

626
00:34:01,493 --> 00:34:03,773
我很理解 
I do understand, you know.

627
00:34:03,813 --> 00:34:07,413
在这方面你妈妈远比我做得好 但我确实理解
Your mother was so much better at this than I am, but I do understand.

628
00:34:07,453 --> 00:34:09,533
我不觉得你理解
I'm not so sure that you do.

629
00:34:09,573 --> 00:34:12,013
他不值得 相信我 他不值得
He isn't worth it. Believe me, he isn't.

630
00:34:12,813 --> 00:34:15,373
我知道你喜欢他 但是这没好处
I know you care about him, but it's no good.

631
00:34:15,413 --> 00:34:17,893
- 也许我和你一样清楚 - 不会有结果的
- Perhaps I know that as well as you. - It has no future.

632
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:20,813
他会伤透你的心 我不忍心看你受伤害
He'll break your heart and I can't bear to see that happen.

633
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:23,493
- 对我来说他比任何事都值得 - 别这样
- He's worth everything in the world to me. - Please.

634
00:34:23,533 --> 00:34:26,009
我不希望你再提起他了 
I don't want you ever to speak of him again, 

635
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,733
你再说的话 我会更加恨你的
because if you do, I will hate you even more.

636
00:34:28,773 --> 00:34:30,933
这个你也理解吗
Do you understand that?

637
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,350
我第一次见
Well, I never!

638
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,790
一只花斑啄木鸟
A s-speckled woodpecker.

639
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,350
多可爱的小鸟
Such a lovely bird!

640
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,150
- 什么东西 - 飞走了
- What is it? - Flown away.

641
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,470
- 让我看看 - 我...我想是我搞错了
- Let me see. - I...I think I might have made a mistake.

642
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:18,390
它走了 黑斯廷斯上校
It's gone, Captain Hastings.

643
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,950
怎么了
What's wrong?

644
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,550
那只鸟飞走了
The bird's gone.

645
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,910
- 你们好 朋友们 - 你好 威廉姆爵士
- Hello, you chaps! - Hello, Sir William.

646
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,510
我们度过了一个非常美好的上午
We've had a perfectly marvellous morning.

647
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:50,030
我好久都没这么开心地购过物了
I haven't been able to do a good shop for simply ages.

648
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,230
比尔 你能把这个拿上去吗
Oh, Bill, could you take that up?

649
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,390
易碎的哦
It's very fragile.

650
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,350
我可以帮你拿其他的
I can bring the rest.

651
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,550
非常感谢
Thanks awfully.

652
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,470
- 有什么事吗 斯蒂文 - 没有
- Anything the matter, Stephen? - No.

653
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,550
- 你看起来像见了鬼一样 - 没 没有鬼
- You look as if you've seen a ghost. - No. No, no ghosts.

654
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,310
只是...在想事情
Just...thinking.

655
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,430
波罗先生
Monsieur Poirot.

656
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,030
怎么了 有麻烦事吗
What is it? Is anything the matter?

657
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,670
麻烦 先生
The matter, monsieur?

658
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,750
什么事是麻烦事
What should be the matter?

659
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:25,710
我突然觉得好累
Do you know, I'm suddenly terribly tired?

660
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,910
劳驾你把这些搬上去
If you could bring those up...

661
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:30,110
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

662
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,190
芭布斯
Ah, Babs! Uh...

663
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,870
我必须得说 护士小姐很擅长看手相
Well, I must say, Nurse is very good at the old palm-reading.

664
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,750
拿好这些 克拉文 给我调杯蛋黄酒
Take these, Craven, and fix me an egg-flip.

665
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,390
我好累
I'm exhausted.

666
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,859
我能做什么吗 芭布斯
Can I do anything, Babs? 

667
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,390
是的 比尔 你可以消失了
Yes, Bill, you can go away.

668
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,590
我脚都没知觉了
I'm dead on my feet.

669
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,350
走太多路了吗
Has it all been too much for you?

670
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:00,150
我不想说什么 我不喜欢麻烦别人
I don't want to mention it. I do so hate being tiresome.

671
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,590
我猜今晚有暴风雨 黑斯廷斯
I reckon we're in for a storm tonight, eh, Hastings?

672
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,750
是啊 也许有
Yes, probably right.

673
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,670
- 失陪了 - 想去花园散散步吗
- Excuse me. - Care to take a stroll around the garden?

674
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,830
- 现在不行 诺顿 - 但是 上校...
- Not now, Norton. - But, Captain...

675
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,110
阿勒顿
Allerton.

676
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,550
- 别去 - 放开我
- You can't. - Let go of me!

677
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,590
- 你什么也做不了 - 你倒成家长专家了
- There's nothing you can do. - The expert parent, eh?

678
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:12,710
- 这样做一点用也没有 - 那就这么定了
- This won't get you anywhere. - That's settled, then.

679
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,430
明天去城里 我就说我去伊普斯威奇呆一两天
Go up to town tomorrow and I'll say I'm off to Ipswich for a night or two.

680
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:19,110
然后从伦敦发电报 说你赶不回来
Wire from London that you can't make it back

681
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:22,070
在我的公寓里吃一顿温馨的晚餐
and we'll have a charming little dinner at my flat.

682
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,510
你不会后悔的 我保证
You won't regret it, I promise.

683
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,910
求你了 黑斯廷斯
Please, Hastings.

684
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,630
你需要的是喝一 一大杯威士忌
What you need is a l-large scotch.

685
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,590
败家子回来了
The prodigal returns.

686
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:47,870
我很抱歉 老朋友 我有点头疼
I'm awfully sorry, old boy. I've got a blinder of a headache.

687
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,070
- 一定是打雷的关系 - 不 不 不
- Must be the thunder in the air. - No, no, no.

688
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,350
那是因为你深陷迷阵
It is because you sit around in the draughts.

689
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,510
- 是吗 - 我很确定
- Is it? - Most assuredly.

690
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,990
那迷阵就是我们所有人的死
The draughts will be the death of us all.

691
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,390
但我有完美解药
But I have just the thing.

692
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,750
热巧克力
The hot chocolate.

693
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:09,630
它能放松神经 明白吗
It nourishes the nerves. You comprehend?

694
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,270
喝吧 喝吧
Drink, drink.

695
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,830
你已经觉得好点了吧
Do you not already feel much improved?

696
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:25,590
都喝完 亲爱的朋友 一滴都不要剩
Drink it all, cher ami, every last drop.

697
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,270
天哪 波罗 我在想什么
My God, Poirot, what was I thinking of?

698
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,270
没错
What indeed!

699
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,750
你为什么昨晚不告诉我
Why did you not tell it to me last night?

700
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,990
- 我怕你会阻止我 - 我一定会
- I was afraid you'd stop me. - Most assuredly I would.

701
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,350
你觉得我会眼睁睁看你被绞死吗
Do you think I wish to see you hanged

702
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:16,870
就为了那个叫阿勒顿的恶棍吗
all on account of a scoundrel so unpleasant called Allerton?

703
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,230
我会把瓶子上的指纹擦掉
Oh, I'd wiped my fingerprints off the bottle.

704
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,910
是的 但也会擦掉阿勒顿的
Yes and also those of Allerton.

705
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:26,710
然后人们发现他死了 会确认他死于药物过量
And then when he is found dead, they establish that he died of an overdose,

706
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,150
但不管是意外 还是蓄意
and whether by accident or by design,

707
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:32,150
他都没有理由擦掉他自己的指纹
he would have had no reason to wipe off his own fingerprints.

708
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,350
而且之后
And then...

709
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,190
他们会发现瓶里的阿司匹林 
they find the aspirin. 

710
00:42:43,191 --> 00:42:44,630
阿司匹林谁都有
Well, everyone has aspirin.

711
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,830
但不是谁都把它和安眠药混在一起
Not mixed with their sleeping pills.

712
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,110
也不是谁都有一个
And not everyone has a daughter 

713
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:53,070
被阿勒顿打无耻盘算的女儿 
whom Allerton is pursuing with the intentions so dishonourable.

714
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:56,590
这会对你非常不利 黑斯廷斯
You see, it would not have looked too good for you, Hastings.

715
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,571
而且也可能会有人看见了你
And then of course it is possible that someone may have seen you. 

716
00:42:59,572 --> 00:43:01,230
我保证没人看见
I can assure you they didn't.

717
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,710
也许有人会透过钥匙孔偷看
Someone might have been peeping through the keyhole.

718
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,510
没有人会无聊到透过钥匙孔偷看的
People do not spend their time peeping through keyholes.

719
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:10,070
这不合常理 总之 我并没真的去做
It's simply not done. Anyway, it didn't come off.

720
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,590
感谢上帝
Thank heavens for that.

721
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,510
但朱蒂丝和阿勒顿之间还是有问题
But there's still the problem of my Judith and Allerton.

722
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,830
她和他今天一起去伦敦了 去他的公寓
She's gone to London with him today - to his flat!

723
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:20,070
羊入虎口啊
Straight into the lion's den.

724
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:24,790
黑斯廷斯 你斗不过那两个人的
Hastings, you are not clever enough to deal with those two.

725
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:29,150
我建议你相信她
I would advise you to trust her.

726
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,030
朱蒂丝
Oh, Judith.

727
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:52,230
毒药开始蔓延 必须马上制止
The poison works...and must be stopped.

728
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,510
愿主帮助我们
God help us.

729
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,950
愿主帮助我
God help me.

730
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:09,235
勒特雷尔夫妇会参加吗 
Are the Luttrells joining us? 

731
00:44:09,236 --> 00:44:10,790
他们在准备纸牌
They're setting up the cards.

732
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:13,990
黑斯廷斯小姐 你今晚看起来美极了
Miss Hastings, you look s-splendid this evening.

733
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,120
也许是受同名之累 你看起来很像那个
Like your namesake might have appeared 

734
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:18,310
砍掉了赫罗弗尼斯首级之前的犹太人朱蒂丝
before c-cutting off the head of Holofernes.

735
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:18,310
{\an8}朱蒂丝是诱惑和杀死亚述统帅赫罗弗尼斯的以色列寡妇    

736
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,350
这么说可有点恐怖 老朋友
That's a bit grim, old boy.

737
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:24,418
不 她这么做完全是基于社会道义 
Oh, no, she did it for strictly moral reasons, 

738
00:44:24,419 --> 00:44:26,030
为了救其他人
to...to save others.

739
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:30,270
"嫉妒是绿眼怪兽" 这句话是谁说的
"Jealousy is a green-eyed monster," this person said.

740
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:30,898
莎士比亚 
Shakespeare. 

741
00:44:30,899 --> 00:44:34,510
是奥赛罗还是艾米拉说的来着
Oh, now, was that Othello or Emilia?

742
00:44:30,899 --> 00:44:34,510
{\an8}亚戈・奥赛罗和艾米拉均为莎士比亚《奥赛罗》中的人物

743
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,910
- 是亚戈 - 看 一颗流星
- Iago. - Look! A shooting star!

744
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,950
- 哪儿 - 又有一颗
- Where? - And another one!

745
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:43,030
你得来看看 赫尔克里叔叔
Oh, you must come and see, Uncle Hercule.

746
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:45,510
- 不不不 谢谢 - 你一定得看看
- No, no, no, merci. - I insist.

747
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:50,390
你应该去许个愿 上校
You're supposed to make a wish, Captain.

748
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,550
- 芭布斯 你怎么不过来呢 - 我太累了
- Babs, come on over, why don't you? - Oh, I'm too tired.

749
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:00,630
胡说 机不可失
Nonsense. It's too good to miss.

750
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,350
比尔 放我下来
Bill! Put me down!

751
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,390
快看啊
Look at that!

752
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:13,950
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

753
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:18,030
我想看这儿是不是有一本...
I was just seeing if there was a copy of uh...

754
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,932
我记得妈妈给我讲过 
I remember mother told me 

755
00:45:20,933 --> 00:45:24,030
你以前曾把她抱到阳台去看星星
how you once carried her out onto a balcony to look at the stars.

756
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:26,230
找到了
Ah, here we are.

757
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,950
生活有时很艰难 对吗
Life's quite hard at times, isn't it?

758
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,710
《奥赛罗》 哪页来着
Othello. Now...where is it?

759
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,793
"当心 我的主人 嫉妒 
"O, beware, my lord, of jealousy; 

760
00:45:41,794 --> 00:45:44,310
它是一只绿眼怪兽"
It is a green-ey'd monster..."

761
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,630
美极了
Splendid.

762
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,630
你说对了 波罗 就是亚戈
You were right, Poirot. It was Iago.

763
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,510
那是当然
But of course.

764
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:55,885
我错过什么了吗
Did I miss anything? 

765
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,950
我可不知道 黑斯廷斯 你错过了吗
I do not know, Hastings. Did you?

766
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,647
当然 黑斯廷斯上校 
Oh, you did, Captain Hastings. 

767
00:45:59,648 --> 00:46:01,470
我从来没见过那么多流星
I've never seen so many shooting stars.

768
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,630
- 克拉文在哪 - 不知道
- Where's Craven? - Not sure.

769
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,910
- 我得吃药了 - 放在哪了
- I need my drops. - Where are they?

770
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,030
在浴室的橱柜里
In the bathroom cabinet.

771
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:10,910
谢谢你 亲爱的
Oh, thank you, dear.

772
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:12,950
我出去转转
Think I'll take a stroll.

773
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,630
你似乎很开心啊 医生
You seem pleased with yourself, Doctor.

774
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:17,150
没错
I am.

775
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:20,670
你来了 能帮我打开药瓶吗
Oh, there you are. Open my drops, would you?

776
00:47:14,262 --> 00:47:17,062
经鉴定芭芭拉・富兰克林是因为
It is established that Barbara Franklin died

777
00:47:17,081 --> 00:47:20,481
服用了硫酸依色林
as a result of poisoning by physostigmine sulphate

778
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:23,081
以及一些毒扁豆碱中毒而死
and other alkaloids of the Calabar bean.

779
00:47:23,961 --> 00:47:26,401
波罗先生 你能告诉我们 在你眼里
Monsieur Poirot, could you tell the court

780
00:47:26,441 --> 00:47:29,069
富兰克林夫人在死前的几个小时里
how Mrs Franklin seemed to you in the hours 

781
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:30,121
状态怎么样吗
before her death?

782
00:47:40,521 --> 00:47:44,673
富兰克林夫人去世的前一天 
On the day before her death, 

783
00:47:44,674 --> 00:47:47,441
我曾和她交谈过
I had a conversation with Madame Franklin.

784
00:47:52,441 --> 00:47:54,801
她看起来非常郁闷
She appeared very depressed...

785
00:47:56,801 --> 00:48:00,281
而且表达了好几次想...
and several times expressed the desire to be...

786
00:48:00,321 --> 00:48:02,121
怎么说来着
How do you say?

787
00:48:03,001 --> 00:48:05,201
摆脱一切
Out of it all.

788
00:48:06,921 --> 00:48:09,511
健康状况和忧郁症
Her health and fits of melancholy 

789
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:13,721
让她的生活看起来失去了意义
made her life seem not to be worth living.

790
00:48:14,961 --> 00:48:19,601
十月十日的早晨 你是不是坐在实验室外面
On the morning of October the 10th, you were sitting outside the laboratory?

791
00:48:19,641 --> 00:48:21,601
是的
Oui.

792
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:24,841
你看见富兰克林夫人从实验室里出来了吗
Did you see Mrs Franklin come out of the laboratory?

793
00:48:26,081 --> 00:48:27,841
是的 看见了
Yes, I did.

794
00:48:27,881 --> 00:48:31,241
她手上拿着什么东西吗 波罗先生
And did she have anything in her hand, Monsieur Poirot?

795
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:38,001
她的右手拿着个小瓶子
She had a small bottle clasped in her right hand.

796
00:48:39,801 --> 00:48:42,081
你确定吗
You are quite sure of that?

797
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:45,401
是的 非常确定
Yes, quite sure.

798
00:48:48,561 --> 00:48:50,056
你也看见了吧
Did you not see it also? 

799
00:48:50,057 --> 00:48:52,001
重点是 你看见了没有
The question is, did you?

800
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:55,081
- 你觉得我在撒谎吗 - 那可是作伪证啊
- You think I would lie? - That would be perjury.

801
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:57,361
不算 我可没发誓
No, I was not on oath.

802
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,521
所以你确实撒谎了
So it was a lie?

803
00:49:01,201 --> 00:49:03,481
你也亲耳听到了她说她想自杀
You yourself heard her speak of suicide.

804
00:49:03,521 --> 00:49:06,801
但女人总是有很多情绪 你还没调查清楚
But she was a woman of many moods. You didn't clarify that.

805
00:49:06,841 --> 00:49:08,961
也许我只是不想呢
Perhaps I did not wish to.

806
00:49:09,001 --> 00:49:12,001
你是说你想让这起案子判为自杀吗
You mean you wanted the verdict to be suicide?

807
00:49:12,721 --> 00:49:14,841
你知道她是被谋杀的 对吧
You think she was murdered, don't you?

808
00:49:15,521 --> 00:49:16,257
没错 
She was. 

809
00:49:16,258 --> 00:49:19,201
但这么判的话就不会有更加深入的审讯了
But this verdict stops all further enquiry.

810
00:49:20,401 --> 00:49:22,182
你在耍什么把戏 波罗
What are you playing at, Poirot? 

811
00:49:22,183 --> 00:49:24,601
这不是一场游戏 老朋友 我向你保证
This is not a game, mon ami, I assure you.

812
00:49:29,161 --> 00:49:31,041
不 不
No, no.

813
00:49:36,241 --> 00:49:38,561
说实话 老伙计 你真的得看医生了
I must say, old man, you really should see a doctor.

814
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:40,576
东一句医生 西一句医生
Doctors, doctors! 

815
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:41,761
你看起来很糟糕
You are looking pretty ropey.

816
00:49:41,801 --> 00:49:43,786
他们该做的都已经做了 
They've done all they can for me. 

817
00:49:43,787 --> 00:49:45,161
我倒希望你也是
I do wish you would.

818
00:49:49,241 --> 00:49:51,361
好吧 好吧
Very well, very well.

819
00:49:52,081 --> 00:49:54,201
- 我就见富兰克林医师 - 富兰克林
- I will see Dr Franklin. - Franklin?

820
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,241
黑斯廷斯 照我说的做 就这一次
Hastings, just do as I tell you - for once.

821
00:50:08,561 --> 00:50:11,641
- 他怎么样 - 恐怕快不行了
- How is he? - He's for it, I'm afraid.

822
00:50:11,681 --> 00:50:13,921
他知道吗
Does he know?

823
00:50:13,961 --> 00:50:16,786
知道 我觉得他一直在担心 
Oh, yes. I gather he's worried about 

824
00:50:16,787 --> 00:50:18,481
有件事情还没做完
getting something finished.

825
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:21,001
- 没错 - 我希望他能早日完成
- That's right. - Then I hope he does.

826
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:23,841
- 没有什么治疗吗 - 不需要
- Isn't there any treatment? - Nothing doing.

827
00:50:24,761 --> 00:50:26,395
当他的心绞痛发作时 
Just his ampoules of amyl nitrite 

828
00:50:26,396 --> 00:50:28,521
及时服用安亚硝酸戊酯就行了
when he feels angina coming on.

829
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:32,161
他是个很出色的人
A remarkable man.

830
00:50:32,201 --> 00:50:35,121
他很尊崇人类的生命 对吗
He has a great respect for human life, hasn't he?

831
00:50:35,161 --> 00:50:37,601
- 是啊 当然 - 不像我
- Yes, absolutely. - Unlike me.

832
00:50:38,441 --> 00:50:40,881
反正人必有一死 又有什么要紧呢
Since death comes anyway, what's it matter?

833
00:50:41,881 --> 00:50:44,361
- 我得出差十天 - 去哪
- Oh, well, ten days and I'm off. - Where to?

834
00:50:44,401 --> 00:50:46,041
非洲
Africa.

835
00:50:46,081 --> 00:50:47,881
工作还要继续
The job's still open.

836
00:50:47,921 --> 00:50:50,121
这也太快了吧
Isn't that rather soon?

837
00:50:50,961 --> 00:50:52,881
还有什么能牵绊我的吗
What's to stop me?

838
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:55,170
我也没什么好装 
It's no good pretending 

839
00:50:55,171 --> 00:50:57,721
芭芭拉的死其实是最好的解脱
that Barbara's death wasn't the greatest relief.

840
00:50:57,761 --> 00:51:00,561
判她自杀你难道不觉得奇怪吗
It doesn't worry you that she's just committed suicide?

841
00:51:00,601 --> 00:51:02,681
不过我还真觉得她不会自杀
But I don't really believe she did.

842
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:04,841
那你觉得是怎么回事
Then what do you think happened?

843
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:07,601
我不知道
I don't know...

844
00:51:08,321 --> 00:51:10,321
也不想知道
and I don't want to know.

845
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:13,361
明白了吗
Understand?

846
00:51:35,921 --> 00:51:37,881
诺顿 到底怎么了
Norton, what's the matter?

847
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:44,860
要判定一件事之是或非
when a thing's right or wrong, 

848
00:51:44,861 --> 00:51:47,441
应该很容易 不是吗
it should be awfully simple to say so, shouldn't it?

849
00:51:48,561 --> 00:51:50,641
- 你懂我的意思吗 - 不懂
- Do you see what I mean? - No.

850
00:51:51,321 --> 00:51:53,641
我想说 说的是...
What I'm t-trying to say is...

851
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:57,262
比如 你不小心拆了一封
say, for example, you happened to open 

852
00:51:57,263 --> 00:51:59,063
别人的信
a letter that wasn't yours

853
00:51:59,064 --> 00:52:00,481
当然是误拆
by mistake, of course -

854
00:52:00,521 --> 00:52:05,441
或者是 从钥匙孔看见了一些东西 懂吗
or...or s-saw something - through a k-keyhole, say?

855
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:07,161
- 一个钥匙孔 - 没错
- A keyhole? - Yes.

856
00:52:07,201 --> 00:52:09,641
你为什么要从钥匙孔里偷看
Why on earth would you be looking through a keyhole?

857
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:11,681
也许因为钥匙卡住了
The key might have got stuck.

858
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:15,201
别拐弯抹角了 你从钥匙孔里看见了什么
Stop beating about the bush. Did you see something through a keyhole?

859
00:52:15,241 --> 00:52:16,281
没有
No.

860
00:52:17,681 --> 00:52:20,361
但你从那副望远镜里看见了什么吧
But you did see something through those glasses of yours?

861
00:52:20,401 --> 00:52:22,801
我们陪科尔小姐出去散步的那天
That day we went out rambling with Miss Cole,

862
00:52:22,841 --> 00:52:25,641
有什么东西你不想让我看见 对吗
there was something you didn't want me to see, wasn't there?

863
00:52:25,681 --> 00:52:28,081
是 没有
Yes. Well...no.

864
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:31,201
是什么东西
What was it?

865
00:52:31,241 --> 00:52:34,921
我不知道该不该说
I...don't know if I ought to say.

866
00:52:34,961 --> 00:52:37,641
我是无意看到的
I didn't m-mean to see it.

867
00:52:37,681 --> 00:52:40,361
确实有一只斑 斑点啄木鸟
There really was a s-speckled woodpecker -

868
00:52:40,401 --> 00:52:42,241
很可爱的家伙
lovely fellow -

869
00:52:42,281 --> 00:52:44,321
然后我看见了其他东西
then I saw the other thing.

870
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:46,241
是不是和富兰克林夫人的死有关
Is it to do with Mrs Franklin's death?

871
00:52:46,281 --> 00:52:48,161
真该死
Oh, damn it all.

872
00:52:48,841 --> 00:52:50,321
我不知道该怎么做
I don't know what to do.

873
00:52:52,521 --> 00:52:55,441
- 他看见了什么却不想告诉你吗 - 没错
- He saw something that he will not tell to you? - That's right.

874
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:01,201
- 他有没有告诉其他人 - 应该没有
- Has he told this to anyone else? - I don't think so.

875
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:06,561
吃过晚饭叫他来见我
Ask him to come up and see me after dinner.

876
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:09,161
就说是一次朋友间的会面
Just a friendly little visit.

877
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,801
小心点 黑斯廷斯
And be careful, Hastings.

878
00:53:14,841 --> 00:53:17,041
要非常小心
Be very careful.

879
00:53:32,361 --> 00:53:34,761
我明天就要搬回自己的老宅子了
I'm moving back to my old pile tomorrow.

880
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:39,961
实话告诉你 我很高兴能尽快摆脱这个鬼地方
I don't mind telling you, I'll be glad to be shot of this place.

881
00:53:40,001 --> 00:53:43,921
这儿让有点阴森森的 比如可怜的芭布斯
It gives me the creeps. Poor Babs, for instance.

882
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:49,601
如果她真是自杀 我的名字就倒着写
If she killed herself, then I'm a monkey's uncle.

883
00:53:51,121 --> 00:53:53,201
你知道我怎么想的吗
You know what I think?

884
00:53:53,241 --> 00:53:55,361
我觉得是她丈夫干的
I think it was that husband of hers.

885
00:53:55,401 --> 00:53:58,161
- 不是吧 - 而且不止我一个人这么想
- You don't mean that. - And I'm not the only one.

886
00:53:58,881 --> 00:54:01,201
从知情人那得到的情报
Had the tip from someone who ought to know.

887
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,807
说曹操 曹操就到 
Talk of the devil. 

888
00:54:05,808 --> 00:54:07,801
我以为她参加完葬礼就走了
I thought she'd left after the funeral.

889
00:54:07,841 --> 00:54:11,161
她在交接新病人之前 回这儿来过个夜
She's back for the night, between engagements.

890
00:54:33,201 --> 00:54:35,481
波罗先生
Monsieur Poirot?

891
00:56:05,081 --> 00:56:07,281
波罗
Poirot?

892
00:56:08,921 --> 00:56:11,001
进来
Entrez.

893
00:56:19,081 --> 00:56:21,321
你还好吗 老朋友
How are you, old chap?

894
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:24,481
还没死
Not dead yet.

895
00:56:26,121 --> 00:56:28,881
- 你和诺顿聊得还好吗 - 很好
- Did you have a good chat with Norton? - Oui.

896
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:32,761
- 他告诉你他看到了什么吗 - 说了
- And he told you what he saw? - Oui.

897
00:56:33,561 --> 00:56:35,881
他看到了什么
Well...what was it?

898
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:41,321
- 你会误会的 - 我当然不会
- You might misunderstand. - Of course, I won't.

899
00:56:42,121 --> 00:56:43,913
他告诉我他看见了两个人 
He tells to me that he saw two people. 

900
00:56:43,914 --> 00:56:45,961
朱蒂丝和阿勒顿 我就知道
Judith and Allerton! I knew it!

901
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:49,721
看吧 不 不是朱蒂丝和阿勒顿
You see? No, not Judith and Allerton!

902
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:52,367
你脑子里装的全是猪油吧 
You have lard for a brain. 

903
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:53,881
这么说可真有点难听
That's a bit harsh.

904
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,921
- 喝水 - 不用了 谢谢
- Drink. - No, thanks.

905
00:56:58,881 --> 00:57:00,401
我要喝
For me!

906
00:57:00,441 --> 00:57:02,441
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

907
00:57:16,961 --> 00:57:19,110
万一发生了什么... 
Now, if anything should happen... 

908
00:57:19,111 --> 00:57:20,881
不会有什么事发生的 波罗
Nothing will happen to you, Poirot.

909
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:25,201
你会在这儿找到所有你要的线索
You will find in here all the clues you need...

910
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,721
- 用这个 - 什么样的线索
- with this. - What kind of clues?

911
00:57:28,761 --> 00:57:31,641
会带领你找到真相的指示
Indications that will lead you to the truth.

912
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:33,761
为什么你要把事情搞得这么复杂
Why do you have to make things so difficult?

913
00:57:33,801 --> 00:57:35,881
我完全蒙在鼓里
I'm completely in the dark as it is!

914
00:57:35,921 --> 00:57:38,241
放心吧 老朋友
Rest assured, mon ami,

915
00:57:38,281 --> 00:57:42,561
当真相来临时 你会宁愿自己不知道
when you see the light... you may wish you had not.

916
00:57:44,801 --> 00:57:47,921
现在我需要思考
And now I need to think.

917
00:57:47,961 --> 00:57:50,841
- 但是 波罗 - 去吃早饭吧 老朋友
- But, Poirot... - Go down to breakfast, mon ami.

918
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:55,121
- 这个案子已经了结了 - 是吗
- The case, it is ended. - Is it?

919
00:57:57,881 --> 00:58:00,041
只需要再整理一些细节
Only loose ends to be tied.

920
00:58:11,441 --> 00:58:14,441
- 你今天起晚了嘛 - 我没有睡好
- You're late up this morning. - I didn't get much sleep.

921
00:58:15,121 --> 00:58:17,881
你看见诺顿了吗 他没来吃早饭
Have you seen Norton? He wasn't at breakfast.

922
00:58:40,281 --> 00:58:42,801
他反锁了门 我听见了
He locked the door. I heard him.

923
00:58:47,321 --> 00:58:48,884
他朝自己开枪了吗 
He shot himself? 

924
00:58:48,885 --> 00:58:50,761
没错 他们是这么说的
Well, that's what they're saying.

925
00:58:50,801 --> 00:58:54,121
门上了锁 钥匙在他的口袋里 枪在他手上
The door was locked, the key was in his pocket, the gun was in his hand.

926
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:56,241
我想只能是他自己干的了
I suppose he must have done.

927
00:58:56,961 --> 00:58:59,601
就像个魔术的把戏 不是吗
It is like a conjuring trick, n'est-ce pas?

928
00:59:07,361 --> 00:59:09,081
黑斯廷斯
Hastings,

929
00:59:09,121 --> 00:59:11,937
有时候你就像个小孩 
sometimes you are like a little child, 

930
00:59:11,938 --> 00:59:15,881
太天真 太轻信别人...
so innocent, so trusting...

931
00:59:19,921 --> 00:59:22,841
波罗 你看起来非常糟糕
Poirot, you're looking pretty awful.

932
00:59:23,561 --> 00:59:25,681
我是不是该找个医生
Don't you think I should call a doctor?

933
00:59:27,001 --> 00:59:29,161
那又怎样呢
What good would that do?

934
00:59:29,201 --> 00:59:31,201
该来的还是会来
What will be will be.

935
00:59:35,721 --> 00:59:39,121
我总是竭尽我所能
I have always tried to do my best, you know.

936
00:59:41,441 --> 00:59:43,361
你相信吗 黑斯廷斯
You do believe that, Hastings?

937
00:59:43,401 --> 00:59:45,201
我怎会不信呢
How could I not?

938
00:59:47,281 --> 00:59:49,601
你觉得上帝会原谅我吗
Do you think God will forgive me?

939
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:53,561
他当然会原谅你
Of course he'll forgive you.

940
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:57,281
你是个好人 是我认识的最好的人
You're a good man - the best a fellow could know.

941
00:59:59,921 --> 01:00:03,626
我对你深表同情
My heart bleeds for you, 

942
01:00:03,627 --> 01:00:06,921
我可怜的孤独的黑斯廷斯
my poor, lonely Hastings.

943
01:00:09,001 --> 01:00:11,081
- 波罗 - 出去吧 我亲爱的朋友
- Poirot... - Go now, cher ami.

944
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:14,081
让我休息一下
Let me rest.

945
01:00:26,441 --> 01:00:28,601
那不是自杀
It was not suicide.

946
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:32,801
是谋杀
It was murder.

947
01:00:59,121 --> 01:01:01,121
亲爱的朋友
Cher ami...

948
01:01:34,201 --> 01:01:36,201
原谅我
Forgive me.

949
01:01:37,921 --> 01:01:39,681
原谅…
Forgive...

950
01:01:59,281 --> 01:02:01,841
黑斯廷斯上校
Captain Hastings?

951
01:02:44,633 --> 01:02:46,833
这是迟早的事
It was bound to happen.

952
01:02:48,713 --> 01:02:51,193
即便这样也并不好受
That doesn't make it any easier.

953
01:02:51,233 --> 01:02:53,273
不
No.

954
01:02:53,313 --> 01:02:55,313
当然不会
No, of course, it doesn't.

955
01:02:57,993 --> 01:03:00,313
说是自然原因
Natural causes.

956
01:03:00,353 --> 01:03:01,873
我很怀疑
I wonder.

957
01:03:01,913 --> 01:03:05,193
你不是在暗示有什么阴谋吧
You're not suggesting foul play, I hope?

958
01:03:05,233 --> 01:03:07,273
看起来似乎很不可能 对吧
It doesn't seem very likely, does it?

959
01:03:07,313 --> 01:03:10,153
爸爸 他是心脏病发了
Father, he had a heart attack.

960
01:03:10,193 --> 01:03:11,673
尽管如此
All the same...

961
01:03:11,713 --> 01:03:14,069
任何事都可能引起他病发 
Anything could have triggered it - 

962
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:16,033
也可能是毫无缘故
or perhaps nothing.

963
01:03:16,073 --> 01:03:18,113
也许他的大限已到
Perhaps his time had come.

964
01:03:20,273 --> 01:03:23,233
他肯定不像可怜的诺顿先生一样是自杀
And it surely wasn't suicide, like poor Mr Norton.

965
01:03:24,273 --> 01:03:26,553
他们说是因为投资失败
Bad investments, so they say.

966
01:03:26,593 --> 01:03:28,393
验尸官觉得
The coroner did think it strange

967
01:03:28,433 --> 01:03:31,713
他能开枪打自己前额中心很奇怪
that he would shoot himself in the centre of his forehead.

968
01:03:31,753 --> 01:03:34,033
你真是多疑
What a suspicious soul you are!

969
01:03:35,313 --> 01:03:37,593
我想是因为这些年和波罗在一起吧
All those years with Poirot, I expect.

970
01:03:38,673 --> 01:03:40,793
他是我最亲近的朋友 
He was my dearest friend, you know.

971
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:45,273
他总是在那里 监督我 责备我
He was always there, keeping an eye on me, ticking me off...

972
01:03:46,953 --> 01:03:48,753
真的就像位父亲
..like a father, really.

973
01:03:49,553 --> 01:03:52,433
我真不知道没了他该怎么办
I'm not quite sure how I'll cope without him.

974
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:03,673
爸爸 有些话我想和你说
Father, I have something to tell you.

975
01:04:03,713 --> 01:04:06,993
亲爱的 我不喜欢这种语气
Oh, dear. I don't like the sound of that.

976
01:04:07,033 --> 01:04:09,793
之前事情一件接一件的 我就没有告诉你
I haven't told you before, what with one thing and another,

977
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:12,993
但事实上 我打算去非洲
but the fact is, I'm going to Africa.

978
01:04:13,033 --> 01:04:14,233
非洲
Africa?

979
01:04:14,273 --> 01:04:16,453
是的 和富兰克林医生一起 
Yes, with Dr Franklin. 

980
01:04:16,454 --> 01:04:18,633
你不能去 人们会怎么说
You can't do that. What will people say?

981
01:04:18,673 --> 01:04:21,753
我不在乎别人说什么 我就是要去
I don't care what people say. The fact is, I'm going.

982
01:04:21,793 --> 01:04:24,713
他妻子在世时 你做他助手是一回事
It's one thing to be his assistant here with his wife alive,

983
01:04:24,753 --> 01:04:25,402
他妻子死之后
but going to Africa 

984
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:26,793
你和他一起去非洲就另当别论了
with him now she's dead.

985
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:30,313
我去不是做他的助手 而是做他的妻子
I'm not going as his assistant. I'm going as his wife.

986
01:04:32,353 --> 01:04:34,469
但...阿勒顿呢 
But...what about Allerton? 

987
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:36,393
我们什么事都没有
There was never anything in that.

988
01:04:36,433 --> 01:04:38,913
如果你没惹我生气的话 我就早点告诉你了
I'd have told you if you hadn't made me so angry.

989
01:04:38,953 --> 01:04:41,513
- 但我看到他吻你了 - 这有什么奇怪的
- But I saw him kiss you. - These things happen.

990
01:04:41,553 --> 01:04:44,233
你不能嫁给富兰克林 现在还不行 太快了
You can't marry Franklin. Not yet. It's so soon.

991
01:04:44,273 --> 01:04:46,633
我能 我也会这么做的
I can and I will.

992
01:04:46,673 --> 01:04:47,890
但是朱蒂丝...
But, Judith... 

993
01:04:47,891 --> 01:04:49,513
我们没理由再等了
We've nothing to wait for now!

994
01:04:54,353 --> 01:04:58,993
当真相来临时 你会宁愿自己没有看到
When you see the light, you may wish you had not.

995
01:05:11,393 --> 01:05:12,273
《奥赛罗》

996
01:05:19,393 --> 01:05:22,073
"去找我的贴身男仆 乔治"

997
01:05:28,393 --> 01:05:31,073
我想波罗先生给你留下了什么口信吧
I believe Monsieur Poirot left you some sort of message.

998
01:05:31,113 --> 01:05:33,233
- 口信吗 先生 - 对 给我的
- Message, sir? - Yes, for me.

999
01:05:33,273 --> 01:05:35,433
没有 先生 我不知道
No, sir, not that I'm aware of.

1000
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,073
你确定吗
Are you quite sure?

1001
01:05:37,113 --> 01:05:39,193
是的 先生 我不记得有
Yes, sir, I'd remember that.

1002
01:05:41,033 --> 01:05:43,153
我想是我记错了
My mistake, I suppose.

1003
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:45,913
你父亲怎么样
How is your father?

1004
01:05:45,953 --> 01:05:47,473
我父亲
My father?

1005
01:05:47,513 --> 01:05:49,273
他很好 谢谢你 先生
He's very well, thank you, sir.

1006
01:05:49,313 --> 01:05:51,073
他现在好些了吧
Oh, he's better, then?

1007
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,633
什么好些了 先生
Better than what, sir?

1008
01:05:52,673 --> 01:05:54,285
你不是因为要去照顾你父亲
That's why you had to leave Monsieur Poirot, 

1009
01:05:54,286 --> 01:05:56,033
才不得不离开波罗先生的吗
wasn't it, to look after him?

1010
01:05:56,073 --> 01:05:57,581
不是我想离开的 先生 
I didn't want to leave, sir. 

1011
01:05:57,582 --> 01:05:58,953
是波罗先生打发我走的
Monsieur Poirot sent me away.

1012
01:05:58,993 --> 01:06:00,473
他为什么要这么做呢
Why would he do that?

1013
01:06:00,513 --> 01:06:04,913
我只能说他打发我走 是因为想雇佣柯蒂斯
I can only suggest that he discharged me because he wanted to engage Curtis.

1014
01:06:06,913 --> 01:06:09,913
- 但为什么呢 - 我真的不知道 先生
- But why? - I really couldn't say, sir.

1015
01:06:09,953 --> 01:06:13,913
尽管他很强壮 却不是很聪明
Not the brightest specimen, although he was strong, of course.

1016
01:06:13,953 --> 01:06:17,793
但我没想到 波罗先生会喜欢他这种人
But I'd hardly have thought he was quite the class Monsieur Poirot would have liked.

1017
01:06:17,833 --> 01:06:20,233
他曾在一家精神病院中做助手 
He'd been an assistant in a mental home. 

1018
01:06:20,234 --> 01:06:21,193
精神病院
A mental home?

1019
01:06:21,233 --> 01:06:24,793
就算他是那儿的病人 我也不会惊讶
It wouldn't surprise me if he'd started off there as a patient.

1020
01:06:36,233 --> 01:06:40,593
四个月后

1021
01:06:40,633 --> 01:06:42,553
我已经通知我的律师们
I have instructed my lawyers...

1022
01:06:42,593 --> 01:06:45,793
在我死后四个月
..to deliver this manuscript to you...

1023
01:06:46,513 --> 01:06:48,753
把这份手稿给你
..four months after my death...

1024
01:06:50,313 --> 01:06:55,113
那时你肯定已经有一套最荒谬的理论了
..by which time you will no doubt have evolved the most preposterous theories.

1025
01:06:55,993 --> 01:06:59,237
但是真的 我的朋友 你现在应该
But really, mon ami, you should by now 

1026
01:06:59,238 --> 01:07:01,833
已经能找出是谁杀了诺顿
have been able to work out who killed Norton.

1027
01:07:01,873 --> 01:07:05,953
就像杀死芭芭拉・富兰克林的人
As to who killed Barbara Franklin, 

1028
01:07:05,954 --> 01:07:07,993
一样会令人惊讶
that may come as more of a shock.

1029
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:12,956
当你问我是否知道谁是凶手时 
When you asked if I knew who was the killer, 

1030
01:07:12,957 --> 01:07:15,313
我没有和你说实话
I did not quite tell to you the truth.

1031
01:07:15,353 --> 01:07:17,593
我是知道的 但要确定一下
I knew, but had to make sure.

1032
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:22,199
我之前从没见过这种人 
You see, I had never met this person before 

1033
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,673
查案时也没见过
and had never seen this person in action.

1034
01:07:25,313 --> 01:07:27,873
这并没有花费我很长时间
It did not take me long.

1035
01:07:27,913 --> 01:07:31,579
最终 在我事业的尾声
At last, at the end of my career, 

1036
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:34,913
我遇到了最完美的罪犯
I had come across the perfect criminal -

1037
01:07:35,673 --> 01:07:37,993
不 是近乎完美
well, nearly perfect.

1038
01:07:38,673 --> 01:07:41,953
一对林 林莺在枫树上搭了巢
Pair of n-nesting b-blackcaps down by the sycamore.

1039
01:07:41,993 --> 01:07:45,193
没人能超过赫尔克里・波罗
No-one gets the better of Hercule Poirot.

1040
01:07:46,393 --> 01:07:48,873
即使是斯蒂文・诺顿
Not even Stephen Norton.

1041
01:07:50,353 --> 01:07:51,633
我真是…
Well, I'll be...

1042
01:07:51,673 --> 01:07:54,513
是的 诺顿就是我们要找的人
Oh, yes, Norton was our man.

1043
01:07:54,553 --> 01:07:57,953
他曾是个病弱的男孩 有个专横的母亲
He had been a sickly boy with a domineering mother,

1044
01:07:57,993 --> 01:07:59,873
他在学校的时光也很艰难
he had had a hard time at school,

1045
01:07:59,913 --> 01:08:02,008
不喜欢血腥与暴力
and disliked blood and violence -

1046
01:08:02,009 --> 01:08:04,313
一个最不像英国人的特点
a trait most un-English.

1047
01:08:05,233 --> 01:08:07,833
但他富有同情心
But he had a sympathetic character

1048
01:08:07,873 --> 01:08:11,033
而且很快就发现 要利用它有多么容易
and soon discovered how easy it was to make use of it.

1049
01:08:11,073 --> 01:08:15,953
通过理解人们 他能洞悉他们最隐秘的想法
By understanding people, he could penetrate their innermost thoughts...

1050
01:08:15,993 --> 01:08:20,833
他十分敏锐 安静的人通常如此
He's very perceptive, you know. Quiet people often are.

1051
01:08:20,873 --> 01:08:23,593
然后他使人们做他们并不想做的事
..and then make them do things they did not want to -

1052
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:26,713
以避免终身受人嘲笑
compensation for a lifetime of derision.

1053
01:08:27,713 --> 01:08:31,285
这种权力感逐渐发展成了一种
This sense of power gradually developed 

1054
01:08:31,286 --> 01:08:34,033
对间接暴力的病态癖好
into a morbid taste for violence at second-hand,

1055
01:08:34,073 --> 01:08:36,753
很快又变成了一种痴迷
which soon turned into an obsession.

1056
01:08:37,673 --> 01:08:41,129
我们斯文的诺顿其实是一个
Our gentle Norton was in fact 

1057
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:44,873
耽于痛苦和精神折磨的施虐狂
a sadist addicted to pain and mental torture.

1058
01:08:45,633 --> 01:08:49,033
记得你第一晚玩桥牌时他说的话吗
Remember the remarks he made that first evening you played bridge?

1059
01:08:49,073 --> 01:08:51,572
看他这样被欺负真叫我恼火 
It gets my back up to see him b-bullied like that. 

1060
01:08:51,573 --> 01:08:52,353
小点声
Keep it down.

1061
01:08:52,393 --> 01:08:54,073
诺顿是故意让他听见的
Norton meant him to hear.

1062
01:08:54,113 --> 01:08:56,753
不过就算想反抗 他也无能为力
Couldn't assert himself if he tried.

1063
01:08:56,793 --> 01:08:59,279
有时成功 有时失败 
Sometimes successful, sometimes not, 

1064
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:02,513
就像毒品一样 时刻让他着迷
it was a drug he constantly craved.

1065
01:09:05,913 --> 01:09:09,193
没有动机 没有迹象 没有证据
No motive, no evidence, no proof.

1066
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:11,193
仅仅是出于邪恶
Simply evil for the sake of it.

1067
01:09:11,233 --> 01:09:15,713
一个永不能被定罪的罪犯
A criminal who could never be convicted of his crimes.

1068
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:19,361
你现在应该知道了
You will have realised by now that 

1069
01:09:19,362 --> 01:09:22,753
富兰克林和朱蒂丝才是两情相悦的
Franklin was in love with Judith and she with him.

1070
01:09:23,433 --> 01:09:25,833
但富兰克林夫人在世时
But with Madame Franklin alive,

1071
01:09:25,873 --> 01:09:28,433
朱蒂丝很痛苦
life was very difficult for Judith,

1072
01:09:28,473 --> 01:09:31,793
而诺顿完全知道风是怎么刮的
and Norton knew exactly how the wind lay.

1073
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:36,833
他很聪明地利用了无用的生命这个话题
He played most cleverly on the theme of useless lives.

1074
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:39,393
我对待生命并不像你们那么神圣
I don't hold life as sacred as you people do.

1075
01:09:40,153 --> 01:09:43,113
病弱的生命 无用的生命 都应该被除掉
Unfit lives, useless lives - they should be got out of the way.

1076
01:09:43,153 --> 01:09:46,092
轻微地嘲讽她不会有胆量
And gently ridiculed the idea 

1077
01:09:46,093 --> 01:09:49,833
根据她的观点 来采取果断的行动
that she would ever have the nerve to take decisive action.

1078
01:09:49,873 --> 01:09:52,553
说的粗俗些 有人有这个胆量吗
Does one have the g-guts, to put it vulgarly?

1079
01:09:52,593 --> 01:09:56,833
而且 黑斯廷斯小姐 我不认为你有
And you see, Miss Hastings, I don't believe you have.

1080
01:09:59,513 --> 01:10:02,121
但是对于一个杀人狂来说 
But with a murder addict, 

1081
01:10:02,122 --> 01:10:04,513
光在一处煽风点火是不够的
one iron in the fire, it is not enough.

1082
01:10:04,873 --> 01:10:07,057
他到处寻找可以利用的机会
He sees opportunities for pleasure everywhere, 

1083
01:10:07,058 --> 01:10:10,633
而且在你身上也找到了一个 我的朋友
and found one in you, mon ami.

1084
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:13,113
他发现了你所有的弱点
He discovered every weak spot

1085
01:10:13,153 --> 01:10:18,033
来激化你对阿勒顿少校的厌恶
to exacerbate your profound dislike of Major Allerton.

1086
01:10:18,073 --> 01:10:20,673
对于年轻的女士
When it comes to young women,

1087
01:10:20,713 --> 01:10:24,993
阿勒顿总有特殊的能力来讨她们欢心
Allerton has rather a special t-technique in that line.

1088
01:10:26,713 --> 01:10:30,058
然后你看到了阿勒顿和朱蒂丝拥吻 
Then you saw Allerton and Judith kiss. 

1089
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,313
你不能去
You can't.

1090
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:32,633
诺顿拉走了你 
Norton hauled you away 

1091
01:10:32,634 --> 01:10:35,193
于是你没有看到后来发生了什么
so that you did not see what followed.

1092
01:10:35,233 --> 01:10:36,953
你去了暖房
You went to the glass house and 

1093
01:10:36,954 --> 01:10:40,393
以为你听到了阿勒顿和朱蒂丝的谈话
thought you heard Allerton talking to Judith.

1094
01:10:40,433 --> 01:10:42,553
然后从伦敦发电报 说你赶不回来
Wire from London that you can't make it back

1095
01:10:42,593 --> 01:10:45,433
我们就在我的公寓里享受令人陶醉的晚餐
and then we'll have a charming little dinner at my flat.

1096
01:10:45,473 --> 01:10:48,713
但你没看到她 甚至也没听到她说话
Yet you did not see her or even hear her speak.

1097
01:10:48,753 --> 01:10:50,393
诺顿确保了这一点
Norton made sure of that,

1098
01:10:50,433 --> 01:10:52,833
因为如果你听到了 
for if you had, you would have discovered

1099
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:56,593
你就不会对朱蒂丝那天去伦敦的事有疑问
that there had never been any question of Judith going to London that day.

1100
01:10:56,633 --> 01:11:00,713
和他有私情的是克拉文护士
It was Nurse Craven with whom he was having the affair.

1101
01:11:00,753 --> 01:11:04,073
但你一头栽进了诺顿的陷阱里
But you fell headlong into the trap of Norton

1102
01:11:04,113 --> 01:11:06,913
还萌生了谋杀的念头
and made up your mind to murder.

1103
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:11,353
那晚我听到你上楼来
I heard you come up that evening

1104
01:11:11,393 --> 01:11:14,513
已经准备实施你的想法
and was already exercised about your state of mind.

1105
01:11:14,553 --> 01:11:17,073
所以当我听到你在走廊
So when I heard you in the corridor...

1106
01:11:17,113 --> 01:11:19,753
并走进阿勒顿的卧室时
and go into the bathroom of Allerton,

1107
01:11:19,793 --> 01:11:21,953
我溜出了我的房间
I slipped out of my room.

1108
01:11:22,433 --> 01:11:24,153
溜出了你的房间?
Slipped out of your room?

1109
01:11:24,193 --> 01:11:25,055
但是... 
But... 

1110
01:11:25,056 --> 01:11:26,673
"怎么做到的" 我听到你问
"How?" I hear you say.

1111
01:11:27,553 --> 01:11:31,193
黑斯廷斯 我并没丧失这个能力
You see, Hastings, I was not helpless at all.

1112
01:11:31,593 --> 01:11:32,288
什么 
What? 

1113
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:34,513
你觉得我为什么要打发走乔治呢
Why do you think I sent George away?

1114
01:11:35,233 --> 01:11:37,753
因为我骗不过他
Because I could not have fooled him into believing

1115
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:40,273
我突然丧失行动能力了
that I had suddenly lost the use ofcmy limbs.

1116
01:11:41,393 --> 01:11:43,913
我听到你进了阿勒顿的卧室
I heard you in the bathroom of Allerton

1117
01:11:43,953 --> 01:11:48,174
敏捷地 用你强烈谴责的方式 
and promptly, in the manner you so much deplore, 

1118
01:11:48,175 --> 01:11:49,473
跪了下来
dropped to my knees.

1119
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:55,393
我意识到了你将要做什么 我做了准备
I realised what you were up to, made my preparations...

1120
01:11:56,153 --> 01:11:58,593
让柯蒂斯来找你
..and sent Curtis to fetch you.

1121
01:12:01,033 --> 01:12:04,593
很抱歉 老伙计 我有些头疼
I'm awfully sorry, old boy. I've got a blinder of a headache.

1122
01:12:04,633 --> 01:12:06,833
于是我给了你一杯热可可
So I gave to you the hot chocolate.

1123
01:12:06,873 --> 01:12:09,913
它可以舒缓你的神经 明白吗
It nourishes the nerves. You comprehend?

1124
01:12:09,953 --> 01:12:11,593
喝吧 喝吧
Drink, drink.

1125
01:12:11,633 --> 01:12:14,593
但是我的朋友 我还放了些安眠药在里面
But I also, mon ami, have sleeping pills.

1126
01:12:14,633 --> 01:12:16,913
不 不 把剩下的都喝完
No, no, no, every last drop.

1127
01:12:22,193 --> 01:12:26,273
等你第二天早上醒来的时候 你又恢复了本性
When you awoke the next morning, you were your own self again,

1128
01:12:26,313 --> 01:12:29,193
为你差点要做的事情感到后怕
horrified at what you had nearly done.

1129
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:32,913
但这使我下了决心 黑斯廷斯
But it decided me, Hastings.

1130
01:12:33,593 --> 01:12:34,886
你不是个杀人犯 
You are not a murderer, 

1131
01:12:34,887 --> 01:12:37,313
但可能会因为一个杀人犯而被绞死
but might have been hanged for one.

1132
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,993
我知道我不能再拖了 必须有所行动
I knew that I must act and could put it off no longer,

1133
01:12:41,753 --> 01:12:45,793
但在我行动之前 芭芭拉・富兰克林死了
but before I was able to, Barbara Franklin died,

1134
01:12:46,553 --> 01:12:50,113
我觉得你不曾怀疑过这件事的真相
and I do not think that you have once suspected the truth.

1135
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:54,873
因为黑斯廷斯 是你杀了她
For you see, Hastings, you killed her.

1136
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:57,713
- 我杀了她? - 对 我的朋友 就是你
- I killed her? - Oui, mon ami, you did.

1137
01:12:58,433 --> 01:13:03,353
因为在这个三角关系中 还有另一角
There was, you see, yet another angle to the triangle,

1138
01:13:03,393 --> 01:13:06,753
我没有考虑进去
one that I had not fully taken into account.

1139
01:13:14,636 --> 01:13:16,116
你可曾想过
Did it ever enter your mind

1140
01:13:16,156 --> 01:13:19,396
为什么富兰克林夫人愿意来斯泰尔庄园
why Madame Franklin was willing to come to Styles?

1141
01:13:19,654 --> 01:13:21,894
她喜欢舒适的生活
She enjoys the good life,

1142
01:13:21,934 --> 01:13:25,054
但却坚持住在一家民宿里
yet insisted on staying in a guest house,

1143
01:13:25,094 --> 01:13:28,814
我肯定诺顿知道为什么
and I have no doubt that Norton knew why.

1144
01:13:28,854 --> 01:13:31,414
- 你们好 伙计们 - 波伊德・卡灵顿
- Hello, you chaps! - Boyd Carrington.

1145
01:13:32,214 --> 01:13:35,014
富兰克林夫人很失望
Madame Franklin was a disappointed woman.

1146
01:13:35,054 --> 01:13:38,894
她本以为富兰克林医生会有出色的事业
She had expected Dr Franklin to have a brilliant career...

1147
01:13:38,934 --> 01:13:41,374
我们得去... 失陪了
There was something we had to... Do excuse me.

1148
01:13:41,414 --> 01:13:44,614
而不是关起门来做难懂的实验
..not shut himself away in esoteric research.

1149
01:13:44,654 --> 01:13:48,694
而波伊德・卡灵顿 富有 气派
And here is Boyd Carrington, rich and aristocratic,

1150
01:13:48,734 --> 01:13:51,482
在她年轻时差点向她求婚
who had nearly asked to marry her when she was a girl, 

1151
01:13:51,483 --> 01:13:53,174
现在仍在追求她
still paying court.

1152
01:13:53,734 --> 01:13:57,494
所以唯一的办法 就是让他丈夫死
So the only way was for her husband to die,

1153
01:13:57,534 --> 01:14:01,854
而诺顿发现她是个很好的工具
and Norton had found her only too ready a tool.

1154
01:14:01,894 --> 01:14:06,054
这些搞科学的人对他们的工作如此痴迷
These scientist chaps can get quite obsessive about their work.

1155
01:14:07,494 --> 01:14:09,454
这很明显
It was so obvious -

1156
01:14:09,494 --> 01:14:11,614
她对这种赞赏的反感
her protestations of admiration,

1157
01:14:11,654 --> 01:14:13,774
还有她对她丈夫的恐惧
then her fears for her husband.

1158
01:14:13,814 --> 01:14:17,934
他研究的东西让我很不安
But it makes me nervous the lengths to which he might go.

1159
01:14:17,974 --> 01:14:20,014
具体是什么呢 夫人
What exactly do you mean, madame?

1160
01:14:20,054 --> 01:14:24,214
就是那个可怕的卡拉巴豆
Well, this horrible Calabar bean thing.

1161
01:14:25,094 --> 01:14:28,054
我很害怕他会拿自己做实验
I'm so afraid he's going to start experimenting on himself.

1162
01:14:28,654 --> 01:14:30,476
但当她看到克拉文护士
But when she saw Nurse Craven 

1163
01:14:30,477 --> 01:14:33,574
给波伊德・卡灵顿看手相时 她很惊恐
reading the palm of Boyd Carrington, she had a fright.

1164
01:14:33,614 --> 01:14:37,534
她知道他会受到迷人女士的魅力影响
She knew he would be susceptible to the charms of an attractive woman

1165
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:39,878
有可能克拉文护士最后会取代她
and perhaps Nurse Craven might end up 

1166
01:14:39,879 --> 01:14:41,854
成为波伊德・卡灵顿的女人
as Lady Boyd Carrington instead of her.

1167
01:14:42,534 --> 01:14:44,694
所以她决定要快点采取行动
So she decided to act quickly.

1168
01:14:45,734 --> 01:14:48,534
她邀请我们都去她的房间喝咖啡
She invites us all up to her room for coffee.

1169
01:14:49,254 --> 01:14:53,294
她的杯子在她旁边 她丈夫的在另一边
Her cup is beside her and that of her husband is on the other side.

1170
01:14:53,334 --> 01:14:55,854
看 流星
Look, a shooting star!

1171
01:14:55,894 --> 01:14:58,486
然后所有人都去看流星了 
Then everyone goes to watch the shooting stars 

1172
01:14:58,487 --> 01:15:00,214
除了你 我的朋友
except you, mon ami,

1173
01:15:00,254 --> 01:15:03,134
和你的字谜与回忆留在了房间里
left with your crossword and your memories.

1174
01:15:04,894 --> 01:15:06,374
你在做什么
What are you doing?

1175
01:15:06,414 --> 01:15:09,725
你转动书架 装作在找一本书 
You hide your emotion by swinging round the bookcase 

1176
01:15:09,726 --> 01:15:11,854
以此隐藏自己的情绪
as if looking for a book.

1177
01:15:11,894 --> 01:15:14,334
因此当我们回来的时候
And so when we all return,

1178
01:15:14,374 --> 01:15:16,152
富兰克林夫人喝下了那杯
Madame Franklin drinks the poisoned coffee 

1179
01:15:16,153 --> 01:15:18,254
原本为她丈夫所准备的毒咖啡
meant for her husband,

1180
01:15:18,294 --> 01:15:21,014
而他则喝掉了原属于她的咖啡
and he drinks the coffee meant for her.

1181
01:15:24,134 --> 01:15:26,974
我知道 在那杯毒咖啡
I realised what must have happened,

1182
01:15:27,014 --> 01:15:31,254
以及你不经意地转动桌子之间一定有联系
that she had poisoned the coffee and you had unwittingly turned the table,

1183
01:15:31,294 --> 01:15:34,294
但黑斯廷斯 我没办法证实
but you see, Hastings, I could not prove it.

1184
01:15:34,934 --> 01:15:36,643
如果富兰克林夫人的死
If the death of Madame Franklin 

1185
01:15:36,644 --> 01:15:38,694
被看做是他杀 而不是自杀
was thought to be anything but suicide,

1186
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:40,674
嫌疑自然而然地便落到了
suspicion would inevitably fall on 

1187
01:15:40,675 --> 01:15:42,614
富兰克林或朱蒂丝的头上
either Franklin or Judith.

1188
01:15:43,254 --> 01:15:45,642
这便是我一直坚持
That is why I was so insistent 

1189
01:15:45,643 --> 01:15:47,814
富兰克林夫人是自杀的原因
that Madame Franklin had killed herself,

1190
01:15:47,854 --> 01:15:51,156
并且我知道大家一定会听从我的意见 
and I knew that my statement would be accepted 

1191
01:15:51,157 --> 01:15:53,294
因为我是赫尔克里・波罗
because I am Hercule Poirot.

1192
01:15:55,014 --> 01:15:57,294
你为此感到不满意 
You were not pleased, 

1193
01:15:57,295 --> 01:16:00,334
但幸好你并未怀疑真正的危机
but mercifully you did not suspect the true danger.

1194
01:16:01,934 --> 01:16:04,414
当我走了以后 你是否曾想过
Will it come into your mind after I am gone,

1195
01:16:04,454 --> 01:16:08,574
就像有一条毒蛇不时出现在你脑海里说
like some dark serpent that now and then raises its head and says,

1196
01:16:08,614 --> 01:16:12,614
"假如 只是假如 凶手会不会是朱蒂丝"
"Suppose, just suppose, it was my Judith?"

1197
01:16:16,174 --> 01:16:18,734
因此你一定要寻找答案
And therefore you must know the truth.

1198
01:16:21,094 --> 01:16:22,911
有一个人对陪审团的裁决
There was one person most unhappy 

1199
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,894
感到最不满意 就是诺顿
with the verdict - Norton.

1200
01:16:26,334 --> 01:16:29,334
他血淋淋的算盘打错了
He was deprived, you see, of his pound of flesh.

1201
01:16:30,414 --> 01:16:32,494
确实 富兰克林夫人死了
Madame Franklin had died, yes...

1202
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:35,334
但并不是以他想要的方式
..but not how he desired.

1203
01:16:36,174 --> 01:16:40,102
他一手安排的谋杀出了差错 
The murder he had arranged had gone awry, 

1204
01:16:40,103 --> 01:16:41,614
该怎么办呢
so what to do?

1205
01:16:41,654 --> 01:16:43,654
诺顿 发生什么事了
Norton, what's the matter?

1206
01:16:44,694 --> 01:16:47,454
他便开始谈起那天 与你和科尔小姐在一起时
He began to throw out hints about what he saw that day

1207
01:16:47,494 --> 01:16:49,094
所看到的情景
with you and Mademoiselle Cole.

1208
01:16:49,134 --> 01:16:50,974
怎么了
What is it?

1209
01:16:51,014 --> 01:16:52,894
他从来没有做过具体的描述
He had never said anything definite,

1210
01:16:52,934 --> 01:16:54,482
因此如果他能扭转你的印象 
so if he could convey the impression 

1211
01:16:54,483 --> 01:16:56,934
让你以为当天他看到的是富兰克林和朱蒂丝
that it was Franklin and Judith that he saw,

1212
01:16:56,974 --> 01:16:58,894
而不是阿勒顿和朱蒂丝时
not Allerton and Judith,

1213
01:16:58,934 --> 01:17:02,367
他就能让你从另一个有趣的角度
then that could open up an interesting new angle 

1214
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:04,574
看待这次自杀案件
on the suicide case,

1215
01:17:04,614 --> 01:17:07,094
甚至能对裁决提出质疑
perhaps even throw doubts on the verdict.

1216
01:17:08,094 --> 01:17:12,735
此时我明白 我一直以来准备的计划
And I realised that what I had planned all along 

1217
01:17:12,736 --> 01:17:14,374
必须马上实施
had to be done at once,

1218
01:17:15,174 --> 01:17:17,814
那是我感到最担心的一刻
the moment I had dreaded -

1219
01:17:17,854 --> 01:17:20,734
也是我人生中最困难的一次决定
the most difficult decision of my life.

1220
01:17:24,814 --> 01:17:28,966
因此那晚我邀请诺顿到我的房间 
That is why I invited Norton to my room that night 

1221
01:17:28,967 --> 01:17:31,734
告诉他我所知道的一切
and told to him all that I knew.

1222
01:17:39,654 --> 01:17:44,654
康士坦次・埃瑟林顿夫人 想要毒死她丈夫
Madame Constance Etherington... tried for the poisoning of her husband,

1223
01:17:44,694 --> 01:17:47,654
一个身为虐待狂的瘾君子
a man who was very sadistic but also addicted to the drugs

1224
01:17:47,694 --> 01:17:50,814
也是与你关系很密切的人
and with whom you are on terms most intimate.

1225
01:17:55,894 --> 01:17:57,120
诺拉・夏尔普
Norah Sharples - 

1226
01:17:57,121 --> 01:17:59,574
被自己的侄女弗雷达・克莱下毒
poisoned by her niece, Freda Clay.

1227
01:18:00,654 --> 01:18:04,454
希望你不是认为我和她的关系也很密切
I hope you're not s-suggesting I was on intimate terms with her.

1228
01:18:08,534 --> 01:18:11,534
这是你和克莱小姐在一起散步
You and Mademoiselle Clay taking a walk together.

1229
01:18:11,574 --> 01:18:14,094
我也是做好功课的 诺顿先生
You see, I do my homework, Monsieur Norton.

1230
01:18:15,614 --> 01:18:17,814
还有马修・利奇菲尔德
And Matthew Litchfield.

1231
01:18:18,934 --> 01:18:21,138
当他被女儿玛格丽特谋杀的那晚 
You visited him, did you not, 

1232
01:18:21,139 --> 01:18:22,654
你不是去拜访他了吗
on the night he was killed by his daughter, Margaret?

1233
01:18:22,694 --> 01:18:25,814
你想说明什么 波罗先生
What is your p-point, Monsieur Poirot?

1234
01:18:25,854 --> 01:18:28,694
诺顿先生 我想要说的是
Ah. My point is this, Monsieur Norton.

1235
01:18:28,734 --> 01:18:31,614
这些谋杀案都没有什么疑点
That in none of these murders was there any real doubt.

1236
01:18:31,654 --> 01:18:34,014
都有一个明显的嫌疑犯 没有其他人
There was one clear suspect. No other.

1237
01:18:34,054 --> 01:18:36,469
但是你 诺顿先生 
But you, Monsieur Norton... 

1238
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:40,494
你是这些案件之间唯一的可怕的共同点
are the one factor malevolent common to all.

1239
01:18:42,174 --> 01:18:44,894
天 天哪 波罗先生
Oh, d-dear, Monsieur Poirot,

1240
01:18:44,934 --> 01:18:49,134
难道你的小脑袋瓜只能得出这样的结论吗
is that the best your little grey cells can come up with?

1241
01:18:49,174 --> 01:18:52,814
你和这三个杀人犯的亲近程度有点太过巧合
Your proximity to these three murders was too much of a coincidence

1242
01:18:52,854 --> 01:18:54,934
而且我闻到了 你所说的 老鼠的味道
and I smelt, as you say, the rat.

1243
01:18:55,734 --> 01:18:57,734
这是我来斯泰尔庄园的原因
That is why I came to Styles -

1244
01:18:57,774 --> 01:19:01,214
是为了来观察你 而你并没有让我失望 先生
to observe you function and you have not disappointed, monsieur.

1245
01:19:01,254 --> 01:19:03,414
你是一个非常聪明的人
No. You are a man who is very clever...

1246
01:19:04,374 --> 01:19:08,774
可是还不足以对付赫尔克里・波罗
..but not clever enough for...Hercule Poirot.

1247
01:19:10,334 --> 01:19:14,014
那你打算怎么做
So...what are you going to d-do about it?

1248
01:19:22,054 --> 01:19:23,854
将你处死
Execute you.

1249
01:19:25,614 --> 01:19:27,094
将我处死
Execute me?

1250
01:19:27,134 --> 01:19:29,134
是的
Oui.

1251
01:19:29,534 --> 01:19:32,094
那...请你动手吧
Then...do get on with it.

1252
01:19:33,294 --> 01:19:35,174
我今晚可是打算早睡觉的
I promised myself an early night.

1253
01:19:35,214 --> 01:19:37,294
正义不是玩笑 先生
Justice is no joking matter, monsieur.

1254
01:19:37,334 --> 01:19:39,375
我会尽我最大的能力去维护它 
I do what I can to serve it, 

1255
01:19:39,376 --> 01:19:40,250
一旦我失败了
but if I fail,

1256
01:19:40,251 --> 01:19:42,334
你将会受到更严重的惩罚 相信我
there is a justice that is higher, believe me.

1257
01:19:42,374 --> 01:19:47,134
你这可怜的自大的小人
You p-pathetic, self-important little man.

1258
01:19:48,894 --> 01:19:50,934
想杀了我
Murder me?

1259
01:19:51,854 --> 01:19:54,654
你内心的罪恶便会跟随你一辈子
There's a m-mortal sin if ever there was.

1260
01:19:55,934 --> 01:19:57,734
接着呢
And then what?

1261
01:19:57,774 --> 01:20:00,894
上吊自杀 以此逃避罪恶吗
Suicide to escape the ignominy of hanging?

1262
01:20:03,414 --> 01:20:06,654
上帝可是会好好款待你的
Your God will give you a hell of a time.

1263
01:20:07,734 --> 01:20:12,134
这么多年来的虔诚 都会因我而化为乌有
All those years of piety up in smoke because of me.

1264
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:13,854
先生
Uh-uh-uh, monsieur.

1265
01:20:13,894 --> 01:20:16,334
你还不能死
You can't go yet.

1266
01:20:16,374 --> 01:20:19,774
我怎么会让你死在我手上
You don't think I'd let you d-die on me,

1267
01:20:19,814 --> 01:20:22,854
就 就此结束我无尽的胜利呢
d-d-deprive me of my ultimate t-triumph?

1268
01:20:23,494 --> 01:20:25,654
求你...求你...
Please... Please...

1269
01:20:26,374 --> 01:20:29,334
如果你不能成功 那我就是自由人
You see, if you don't succeed, I'm a free man.

1270
01:20:30,054 --> 01:20:34,254
即使你成功了 我也并没有输
Even if you do, it would still be a victory of sorts,

1271
01:20:34,294 --> 01:20:38,374
因为在法律的眼里 我还是清白的
because in the eyes of the law I would be innocent.

1272
01:20:39,054 --> 01:20:42,671
可是你 以及你的声誉 
Whereas you and your reputation - 

1273
01:20:42,672 --> 01:20:44,974
你那宝 宝贵的声誉
your p-precious reputation -

1274
01:20:45,014 --> 01:20:46,494
便化为灰烬
blown to bits.

1275
01:20:46,534 --> 01:20:49,254
- 求你了 - 求你了
- Je vous en prie. - Je vous en prie.

1276
01:20:50,214 --> 01:20:51,534
你听到他们说了吗 
You can see them now: 

1277
01:20:51,535 --> 01:20:53,734
"他疯了 外国人永远都不可信"
"Went off his rocker. You can never trust a foreigner."

1278
01:20:57,014 --> 01:21:00,534
发现我对你有多好了吗 老家伙
You see how good I am to you, old man?

1279
01:21:03,014 --> 01:21:04,534
这就对了
There you go.

1280
01:21:04,574 --> 01:21:06,894
慢慢来
Take your time...

1281
01:21:06,934 --> 01:21:10,494
让我们一起来看看最后谁会成功 好吗
and see how it all...pans out, shall we?

1282
01:21:12,294 --> 01:21:15,734
谁将会拉下最后的帷幕
Who will be there at the final curtain?

1283
01:21:32,894 --> 01:21:34,814
我为你感到可怜 诺顿
I pity you, Norton.

1284
01:21:36,174 --> 01:21:40,094
在如此美好的世界里
How very sad to find that this great and beautiful world

1285
01:21:40,134 --> 01:21:42,614
你看到的只有腐烂和失望
is so foul and disappointing.

1286
01:21:45,214 --> 01:21:47,958
还有你母亲 
And your mother...

1287
01:21:47,959 --> 01:21:51,094
我更为她感到可怜
I pity even more.

1288
01:21:51,134 --> 01:21:54,454
我的母 母亲 你为她感到可怜
My m-mother? You pity my mother?

1289
01:21:55,214 --> 01:21:57,454
忍受着带你出生的痛苦
To endure the agony of bringing you forth

1290
01:21:57,494 --> 01:22:01,774
却发现她所孕育的是一个变态
only to discover that she had nurtured in her loins such wickedness.

1291
01:22:02,534 --> 01:22:05,254
难道这不值得可怜吗
Is that not worthy of pity?

1292
01:22:05,294 --> 01:22:07,494
是你不值得可怜
It is you who is not worthy.

1293
01:22:08,214 --> 01:22:10,197
她对我来 来说就是整个世界 
She m-meant the world to me. 

1294
01:22:10,198 --> 01:22:11,614
那你对于她来说呢
And you to her?

1295
01:22:11,654 --> 01:22:13,654
她爱 爱我
She l-loved me...

1296
01:22:14,254 --> 01:22:18,334
她非 非常爱我 甚 甚至...
..l-loved me more than...m-more than...

1297
01:22:18,374 --> 01:22:22,574
她是否曾像母亲一样拥抱你 诺顿
Did she ever hold you, Norton, as mothers do,

1298
01:22:23,254 --> 01:22:26,934
轻抚你的头发 亲吻你的脸颊
stroke your hair...kiss your cheek?

1299
01:22:26,974 --> 01:22:29,614
她... 她...
She... She...

1300
01:22:29,654 --> 01:22:32,014
害怕你 对吗
Scared you, did she not?

1301
01:22:32,454 --> 01:22:34,347
她把你从身边推开 
She pushed you away, 

1302
01:22:34,348 --> 01:22:37,294
不给予你一丝人间最温暖的情感
starved you of what we all desire,

1303
01:22:37,334 --> 01:22:40,054
因为她知道关于你的一切
because she knew everything about you.

1304
01:22:40,094 --> 01:22:42,374
我母亲什么都不知道
My mother knew nothing.

1305
01:22:42,414 --> 01:22:46,134
诺顿先生 母亲们都知道
Oh, Monsieur Norton, mothers know.

1306
01:22:47,454 --> 01:22:49,334
她们一直都知道
They always know.

1307
01:23:04,654 --> 01:23:06,654
毫无根据 波罗
Shots in the dark, Poirot.

1308
01:23:08,254 --> 01:23:10,734
毫无根据
Shots in the dark.

1309
01:23:27,574 --> 01:23:29,054
喝点热巧克力吗
Chocolate?

1310
01:23:33,614 --> 01:23:37,534
我可以喝你的那杯吗
Would you mind awfully if I drank yours instead?

1311
01:23:44,414 --> 01:23:46,174
当然可以
Not at all.

1312
01:23:59,094 --> 01:24:01,454
这对我无关紧要
It was quite immaterial.

1313
01:24:01,494 --> 01:24:05,574
我睡前都需要吃安眠药 因此具有一定耐药性
I take the sleeping tablets and have acquired a certain tolerance.

1314
01:24:05,614 --> 01:24:08,044
那些能让诺顿沉睡的药 
The dose that would send Norton to sleep 

1315
01:24:08,045 --> 01:24:10,254
对我而言没有多大影响
would have little effect on me.

1316
01:24:14,974 --> 01:24:18,374
我费了很大力气 把他挪到我的轮椅上
With the greatest of difficulty, I put him in my wheelchair.

1317
01:24:18,414 --> 01:24:22,214
趁没人的时候 我把他推到了他的房间
Then when the coast was clear I wheeled him to his room.

1318
01:24:27,254 --> 01:24:29,054
你或许还没有发现 黑斯廷斯
You will not have realised, Hastings,

1319
01:24:29,094 --> 01:24:32,934
最近我一直戴着假胡须
that recently I have taken to wearing the false moustache.

1320
01:24:32,974 --> 01:24:35,294
这点连乔治也不知道
Even George does not know that.

1321
01:24:36,334 --> 01:24:38,574
我穿了诺顿的睡袍
I put on the dressing gown of Norton...

1322
01:24:39,614 --> 01:24:41,574
去敲了敲你的门
..tapped on your door...

1323
01:24:44,094 --> 01:24:46,174
接着走进他的浴室
..then went into his bathroom.

1324
01:24:48,134 --> 01:24:51,974
不久便听到你的开门声
Presently I heard you open your door.

1325
01:24:52,014 --> 01:24:54,854
我离开了浴室 回到诺顿的房间
I left the bathroom and returned to the room of Norton,

1326
01:24:55,614 --> 01:24:57,734
锁上了门
locking the door behind me.

1327
01:24:58,774 --> 01:25:00,774
为诺顿穿上长袍
I put the dressing gown on Norton...

1328
01:25:01,614 --> 01:25:03,094
把他放到床上
..and lay him on his bed.

1329
01:25:09,774 --> 01:25:12,014
我有一把手枪
I had a pistol,

1330
01:25:12,054 --> 01:25:13,087
曾经有两次 
which on two occasions 

1331
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:16,014
趁他出门的时候 我将手枪放在他梳妆台上
I had placed ostentatiously on the dressing table of Norton

1332
01:25:16,054 --> 01:25:17,614
显眼的地方
when he was out,

1333
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:20,054
这样女佣便会看到
so that the maid would have seen it.

1334
01:25:50,214 --> 01:25:53,414
我把钥匙放在了他的长袍口袋里
I put the key into the pocket of his dressing gown

1335
01:25:53,454 --> 01:25:56,894
用我复制的另一把钥匙 从门外锁了门
and locked the door from the outside with a duplicate I had made...

1336
01:25:58,574 --> 01:26:02,134
接着回到了我的房间 写下这封信
..then returned to my room and began writing this.

1337
01:26:06,854 --> 01:26:10,014
正如你们英国人所说 我按章办事
I played the game, as you English say.

1338
01:26:11,974 --> 01:26:16,174
我给了你所有的线索和机会去发现真相
I gave to you the clues and every chance to discover the truth,

1339
01:26:16,214 --> 01:26:20,094
把你指向亚戈 原版的斯蒂文・诺顿
pointing you towards Iago, the original Stephen Norton.

1340
01:26:21,974 --> 01:26:25,847
我唯一的缺点 是在他的额头中间开了枪 
My only weakness was to shoot him in the centre of 

1341
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:27,214
而不是在太阳穴
his forehead and not in his temple,

1342
01:26:27,254 --> 01:26:31,214
但我不想使自己造成如此出乎意料的效果
but I could not bring myself to produce an effect so lopsided.

1343
01:26:32,374 --> 01:26:35,420
而这些 我的朋友 就是我的本性 
That, mon ami, is my nature 

1344
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:37,134
也是要告诉你的真相
and should have told to you the truth.

1345
01:26:39,054 --> 01:26:41,654
最后再听一次我的建议
Take my advice for the last time.

1346
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:45,214
将我所说的一切告诉科尔小姐
Tell to Mademoiselle Cole all that I have said,

1347
01:26:45,254 --> 01:26:48,974
告诉她你也差点做了和她姐姐一样的事
that you also might have done what her sister did...

1348
01:26:49,694 --> 01:26:52,574
如果没有谨慎的波罗阻止你的话
..had there been no watchful Poirot to stop you.

1349
01:26:53,854 --> 01:26:58,574
将噩梦带走 告诉她 诺顿才是
Take the nightmare away and show how Norton, not her sister,

1350
01:26:58,614 --> 01:27:01,134
导致她父亲死亡的元凶 而不是她姐姐
was responsible for the death of her father.

1351
01:27:41,374 --> 01:27:42,894
黑斯廷斯上校
Captain Hastings?

1352
01:28:01,974 --> 01:28:04,134
我没有别的话要说了
I have no more to say.

1353
01:28:05,174 --> 01:28:07,534
我所做的事是正义的吗
Am I justified in what I have done?

1354
01:28:08,534 --> 01:28:10,614
我不知道
I do not know.

1355
01:28:11,334 --> 01:28:15,254
我不认为一个人应该将法律掌控于自己手中
I do not believe that a man should take the law into his own hands,

1356
01:28:16,694 --> 01:28:20,294
取了诺顿的性命 我是否也拯救了别的生命呢
but by taking the life of Norton, have I not saved others?

1357
01:28:22,054 --> 01:28:25,174
我一直以来都很相信自己 可这一次...
I have always been so sure, but now...

1358
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:30,334
当那一刻来临的时候
When the moment comes,

1359
01:28:30,374 --> 01:28:32,654
我不会再救我自己
I will not try to save myself,

1360
01:28:33,414 --> 01:28:36,185
而是卑微虔诚地把灵魂交予上帝 
but humbly offer my soul to God 

1361
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:37,294
祈求他的仁慈
and pray for his mercy.

1362
01:28:39,214 --> 01:28:41,374
一切都由他来定夺
It is for him to decide.

1363
01:28:43,814 --> 01:28:47,158
黑斯廷斯 我亲爱的朋友 
Ah, Hastings, my dear friend, 

1364
01:28:47,159 --> 01:28:49,894
过去的时光多么美好
they were good days.

1365
01:28:51,294 --> 01:28:55,134
是啊 过去的时光一直都那么美好
Yes, they have been good days.

1366
01:28:58,334 --> 01:29:01,534
赫尔克里・波罗
Hercule...Poirot.

1367
01:29:17,334 --> 01:29:22,334
