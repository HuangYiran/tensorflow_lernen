我们得找到基拉·汀斯利

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,410
她要么跟血腥约翰是一伙的
She either works for Red John,

00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,500
要么马上就要成为他下一个目标了
or she's about to become his next victim.

00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,320
谁干的  告诉我
Who did this to you? Tell me.

简  她说什么了
Jane, what did she say?

25
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,300
她说血腥约翰左肩膀有个纹身
She told me Red John has a tattoo on his left shoulder--

26
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,570
三个点
Three dots.

27
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,130

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,050
纹身吗
A tattoo?

42
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,870
对
Yes.

43
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,190
我们可以用那个来确定血腥约翰的身份
That we can use to identify Red John?

44
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,720
-是的  -太好了
- Yes. - That's great.

45
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,810
所以我们只要一个个检查疑犯
So all we have to do is check each one of the suspects

46
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,040
看哪个人身上就纹身就行了
one by one until we find out who has the tattoo.

47
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,990
不行
No.

48
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,800
为什么不行
Why not?

49
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,030
血腥约翰还不知道我发现纹身的事
Red John doesn't know I know about the tattoo.

50
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,480
好吧
Okay.

51
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,220
所以如果我们去查他们
So if we start checking suspects,

52
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,220
很有可能血腥约翰会发现此事
it's very likely that red john will find out.

53
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,690
然后在我们还没机会接近他的时候就销声匿迹
And disappear before we have a chance of getting him.

54
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,900
正是如此
Exactly.

55
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,270
那你们打算怎么办
Then what do you want to do?

56
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,880
把五名疑犯同时
Gather all five suspects together

57
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,070
集合到一个地方
at the same place, same time,

58
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,880
然后再检查是否有纹身
And then start checking for the tattoo.

59
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,760
如何才能做到呢
And how do we do that?

60
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,570
就直接叫他们过来
We'll ask them.

61
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,330
你觉得他们会同意吗
And you think they'll agree?

62
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,700
没打算给他们选择的余地
Wasn't planning on giving them a choice.

63
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,570
就算成行了  还有个问题
Even so, there's a problem.

in connection to two homicides.

66
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,820
对  二十多年前的悬案
Yeah. Cold cases from over 20 years ago.

67
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,530
真的假的
You're kidding,

68
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,650
都过去那么多年了
after all this time,

69
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,180
联调局现在才跟进吗
the F.B.I. is moving in now?

70
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,590
他们肯定是有了什么新的
Well, they must have found something new--

71
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,020
-法医证据  目击证人  -那斯特尔斯在哪
- forensics, a witness. Well, where's Stiles?

72
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,480
关键就是这个  没人知道他在哪
Well, that's the thing. Nobody knows,

73
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,560
连联调局也不知道  斯特尔斯几周前就消失了
Not even the F.B.I. Stiles disappeared weeks ago.

74
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,010
我们会找到他的
We'll find him.

75
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,430
怎么找
How?

I don't know, but we'll find him.

77
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,150
必须找到他
We have to.

78
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,830
我配合你的计划
I'm on board with your plan.

Good.

80
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,410

On one condition.

81
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,090
你揭露血腥约翰身份的时候我要在场
I want to be there when you reveal Red John.

Okay.

83
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,480
我说真的
Seriously.

84
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,280
-我说了好的  -说是说了  但你说的肯定不算数
- I said okay. - Yeah, but you didn't mean it.

85
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,330
是吗  你怎么知道
Did I not? Uh, how can you tell?

86
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,120
这事没有商量的余地  简
This is non-negotiable, Jane.

87
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,760
我百分百同意
I agree 100%.

88
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,650
我认为我之前说得够清楚了  探员们
I think I've made myself clear, agents.

89
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,740
我完全不知道布莱特·斯特尔斯在哪
I have no knowledge of Bret Stiles' whereabouts.

90
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,940
对  你说了
Yes,

91
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,090
而我们也表达得很清楚了  你这说法我们不买账
and we've made it clear that we're not buying it.

92
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,820
斯特尔斯把天眼组织的领导权留给了你
Stiles leaves you in charge of Visualize,

93
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,590
但他却没有告诉你他躲藏在哪里吗
but he keeps you in the dark about where he's hiding?

94
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,740
这根本说不通
Doesn't make sense.

95
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,890
斯特尔斯自始至终
Stiles has and always will

96
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,310
都将教徒的需要放在他自己之前
put the church's needs before his own.

97
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,850
这次也一样
This time is no different.

98
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,240
他不想让我知道是因为他想保护我
He doesn't want me to know because he wants to protect me.

99
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,970
也因为他不想被人找到
And because he doesn't want to be found.

100
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,500
我不觉得布莱特·斯特尔斯担心是否会被找到
I doubt Bret Stiles is worried about being found.

101
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,140
你看起来很有信心
You seem confident.

102
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,410
这叫信仰
Call it faith.

103
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,900
斯特尔斯在我们这个
You see, Stiles' time

104
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,350
现实世界里的时间  是有限的
in our... reality is limited.

105
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,670
就在我们说话的这会
As we speak,

106
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,470
他正在做好心理和身体上的准备
he's preparing his mind and body

107
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,410
以摆脱我们这个物质世界的束缚
for a departure from the confines of our material world.

108
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,060
他要死了吗
He's dying?

109
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,510
这是非常天真
That is a very naive,

110
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,790
非常无知的想法
very ignorant way of looking at it.

111
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,250
布莱特·斯特尔斯不会死
Bret Stiles is not dying.

112
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,800
他也不能死
Bret Stiles cannot die.

113
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,290
他是要将自己提升到一个新的高度
He is elevating himself to another plane,

114
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,250
我们这种道行不够的
one lesser men like ourselves

115
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,650
要非常艰难才能触碰到这种高度
can only strive to reach.

116
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,100
显然我们中有人对此是无法理解的
And one some of us obviously can't comprehend.

135

138
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,430

I need time to find a safe place to meet.

139

好吧  在哪见
Fine. Where?

This is crazy.

我已经犯过很多次错误了
I've made the mistake of underestimating Red John

143
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,710
总是低估了血腥约翰
a number of times now.

144
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,470
我不想再犯这种错误了
I don't want to make that mistake again.

145

If you want the information, it's on my terms.

为什么要搞得这么神秘
What is with all the secrecy?

Where are you?

Oh, just running some errands.

一切都好吗
Everything okay?

295
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,440
好极了  有事吗
Yeah, right as rain. What's up?

哈弗内答应了
Haffner's in.

323
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,540
能见他我再高兴不过了
nothing would please me more than to meet with him.

324
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,780
我真的很乐意  但是
I mean, really, I would love to. But...

很不幸的是  鉴于我现在的境况
unfortunately, my circumstances--

好像不太能成行
it's probably not gonna happen.

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,960
你是说因为联邦调查局吗
You mean because of the F.B.I.?

328
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,690
你功课做得不错嘛
Mm. You have been doing your homework.

他们不知道我来了
They don't know I'm here.

330
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,710
所以他们也就不知道你在这里
Which means they don't know you're here.

331
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,460
但你要是不肯见简  他们就会知道了
But they will if you don't agree to meet with Jane.

332
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,680
你的确变了  不是吗
You have changed, haven't you?

333

你去过厄瓜多尔吗
Have you ever been to Ecuador, by any chance?

00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:22,640
他很穷  但野心勃勃
he was underprivileged, ferociously ambitious.

340
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,610
我在他身上看到了些东西
I saw something in him.

341
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,200
所以我决定试着帮帮他
So I decided to try and help him.

342
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,050
我帮他付学费
You know, I-I paid for his school fees,

343

that sort of thing.

344

N-nothing really much, but wouldn't you know it?

00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:45,560

Anyway, he invited me to stay in this palatial consulate.

This morsel of foreign soil.

is outside the jurisdiction of you, the F.B.I.,

So, you see, Gracie, your idle threats are just that.

You will, sir.

What do you want to do?

00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,000
我来对付斯特尔斯
I'll handle Stiles.

382
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,260

He's not gonna come with you. He doesn't have to.

383
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,750

I'll be persuasive.

384

You don't want me to be there.

391
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,990
是的
No, I don't.

392
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,600
你不希望我在场是因为你觉得

Are you saying that you won't?

395
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,000
我想说的是
What I'm saying is some men--

398
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,170
这种人就该就地正法
They deserve what they have coming to them.

399

00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,490
在血腥约翰案上吗  没错
About Red John? Yes.

You would never lie, not about something like this.

00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,380
我相信你
I believe you do.

427
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,910
可是派翠克
But you see, Patrick,

428
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,140
将死之人还怕什么死亡威胁呢
a dying man does not fear death.

429
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,200
省省吧
Oh, please.

430
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,310
装模作样骗骗你那些信徒还行
This charade might work on your disciples.

431
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,700
骗我就算了吧
It doesn't work on me.

432
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,460
你太高估我了
You think too highly of me.

433
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,960
非常不幸的是
Unfortunately,

434
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,310
这次不是装的了
it's not a charade.

435
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,350
你还剩多长时间
How long have you got?

436
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,120
已经扩散到血液了
It's spread to the blood.

437
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,320
已经无药可医了  我不知道
There's nothing they can do. I don't know...

438
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,170
也许两周  也许一个月
Two weeks, a month.

439
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,970
听我说
You see...

440
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,130
这不是针对你
it's not personal.

441
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,680
只是现在
It's just that...

442
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,430
时间对我来说太宝贵了
my time now is very precious.

443
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,970
今晚我还是需要你来
I'm still gonna need you tonight.

444
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,410
看在上帝的份上  为什么
For god sake, why?

445
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,620
有什么事如此重要
What's so damned important?

446
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,230
血腥约翰
Red John.

447
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,870
我终于接近他了
I'm close.

448
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,220
前所未有的接近
Closer than I've ever been.

449
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,530
血腥约翰
Red John...

450
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,080
听着
Look...

451
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,200
今晚我若能去见你
nothing would give me more pleasure

452
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,350
那是再高兴不过了
than to be with you there tonight.

453
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,130
但是
But?

454
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,180
我的情况比你想象的复杂
There's more to this than you know.

455
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,680
我被困在这儿还有别的原因
There's--there's more keeping me here.

456
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,620
联调局吗
The F.B.I?

457
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,910
对  事实正是如此
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

458
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,430
他们跟我到这里
You know, they tracked me here.

459
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,840
就等着我出去
They're just waiting for me to leave

460
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,220
然后逮捕我
so they can arrest me.

461
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,510
不是我想呆在这儿的
Look, I'm not choosing to stay here,

462
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,990
我被困住了
but I'm trapped.

463
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,100
这么说联调局是唯一的问题了
So the F.B.I's the only thing that's keeping you here?

464
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,310
注意  前门有动静
Eyes up, we've got movement at the front entry.

465
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,630
是天眼组织的车
That's a Visualize car.

466
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,800
他们在偷偷往外转移什么人
I think they're sneaking someone out.

467
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,700
随时准备行动
Get ready to move.

468
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,490
立即行动  行动  上
Go now! Go! Go! Go!

469
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,350
-不许动  -不许动
- Don't move! - Don't move!

470
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,750
把手放在方向盘上
Hands on your steering wheel!

471
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,240
把手放在我们能看见的地方
Keep your hands where we can see 'em.

472
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,610
你们好  先生们
Hello. Gentlemen.

473
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,940
有什么能为你们效劳的吗
Something I can help you with?

474
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,950
斯特尔斯入局了
Stiles is in.

475
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,640
我们该出发了
We'd better get going.

476
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,400
我们可有很长一段车程
We've got a long drive ahead of us.

477
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,610
把他带走
Take him.

478
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,580
{\an8}晚上八点  马里布  雪松街1309号见  走便道

479
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,170

480
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,370
那么萨城警局只有等着了
Well, then Sac P.D.'s just gonna have to wait.

481
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,520
我不想用职权压人
Look, I-I don't wanna pull rank...

482
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,690
但若有必要我会的
but I will.

483
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,480
凯文  回头我再打给你
Kevin, I gotta call you back.

484
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,230
我需要一辆车
I'll be needing a car.

485
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,650
我们要去干什么
What are we doing?

486
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,680
我想看看日落
I want to see the sunset.

487
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,280
里斯本  有些话我想跟你说
There's something I want to tell you, Lisbon.

488
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,220
很早以前就应该跟你说了
Something I should have said a long time ago.

489
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,480
谢谢你做的一切
I want to thank you for everything that you've done.

490
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,670
晚点再谢也不迟
You can thank me later.

491
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,710
不
No, I...

492
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,810
我必须现在就说
I need to say this now.

493
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,020
你
You have...

494
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,930
不知道你对我意味着什么
no idea what you've meant to me.

495
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,890
你对我有多重要
What you mean to me.

496
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,580
谢谢你
Thank you.

497
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,360
差点忘了  我有个惊喜给你
I almost forgot. I have a surprise for you.

498
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,510
在这等我
Wait here.

499
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,070

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,480
我叫特蕾莎·里斯本
My name is Teresa Lisbon.

506
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,830
我是加州调查局探员
I am an agent with the California Bureau of Investigation,

507
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,130
现在我要征用你的车

508
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,190
这是紧急情况
It's an emergency.

509
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,030
什么  不行
What?! No way.

510
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,700
立即下车  快
Get out. Now. Come on.

511
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,800
快
Come on.

512
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,210
太过分了
This is outrageous.

513
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,870
我要报警
I'm calling the police.

514
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,490
好主意  谢谢
Good idea. Thanks.

515
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,460
-简  -喂  里斯本
- Jane. - Hello, Lisbon.

516
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,130
简  别这么做  别扔下我这么做
Jane, don't do this, not without me.

517
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,250
对不起
Listen, I'm sorry.

518
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,890
简  求你了  你身处险境

520
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,960
我不会有事的
I-I'm gonna be okay.

521
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,110
不可能
No, you're not.

522
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,280
你这样做是在自寻死路
You do this, and you're throwing your life away.

523
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,140
再见  里斯本
Bye, Lisbon.

我来早了吗
Am I early?

528
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,390
不早  来得正好  坐吧
No, no. Right on time. Have a seat.

529
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,480

9-1-1. What's your emergency?

530
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,850
我是加州调查局的

531
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,650
特蕾莎·里斯本探员
with the California Bureau of Investigation.

532
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:26,660
请派警员到马里布的雪松街1309号
I need officers at 1309 Cedar Street in Malibu.

533
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,220
有探员需要立即支援
I have an agent who needs immediate assistance.

534
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,550
我让你们五个聚在一起是有原因的
I brought you five together for a reason.

535
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,710
有人可能知道了
Some of you may know that reason.

536
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,490
也有人可能猜到了
Some of you may have guessed.

537
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,150
你们中的一个人
But one of you here...

538
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,260
是血腥约翰
is Red John.

539
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,830
什么  在我们几个中间
What?! One of us?

540
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,060
我们其中之一是血腥约翰
One of us here is Red John?

541
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,370
真有意思
Well, that's very interesting.

542
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,670
-是谁  -我不知道
- Who is it? - I don't know.

543
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,270
我们到这来就是为了找出答案
And that's what we're gonna find out.

544
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,390
你是想说这个房间里的某个人
Wait, you're trying to say that one of us in this room...

545
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,560
是个连环杀手
is a serial killer?

546
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,960
-我很确定  -太荒唐了
- I know it. - No, this is crazy.

547
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,520
我向你保证完全不荒唐
I can assure you it's not.

548
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,520
我向你保证  我才不跟你在这儿胡闹
Well, I can assure you I'm not sticking around for this crap.

549
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,210
坐下
Sit down.

550
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,240
一步都别想往门口走
Do not move toward the door.

551
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,800
谁都不准走
No one is leaving.

552
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,960
放轻松  派翠克
Take it easy, Patrick.

553
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,570
我看起来很紧张吗
Do I look distressed?

554
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,160
别动
Don't.

555
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,630
我会开枪的
I will shoot you.

556
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,390
其他人也一样
That goes for the rest of you as well.

557
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,310
慢慢把你们的枪拿出来  放在地上
Take out your weapons slowly, place them on the floor,

558
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,660
推到我这边来
and push them toward me.

559
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,030
谢谢
Thank you.

560
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,550
谢谢
Thank you.

561
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,140
行了  派翠克
Okay, Patrick.

562
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,290
够了
This is... this is enough.

563
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,840
该到此为止了
It's gone far enough.

564
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,020
不  这才刚刚开始呢
No, we're just getting started.

565
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,620
为这一刻  我等了十年
I've waited ten years for this moment.

566
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,120
多年来  血腥约翰一直很狡猾
All those years, Red John has been smart.

567
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,510
你们中的某个人一直很狡猾
One of you has been smart.

568
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,570
很谨慎  除了这次
