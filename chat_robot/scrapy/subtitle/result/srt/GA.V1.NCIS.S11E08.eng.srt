3
00:01:24,745 --> 00:01:26,394
All right, Ducky, I'm done.

4
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:28,563
Thank you, Tim.

5
00:01:31,485 --> 00:01:34,486
You poor dear.

6
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:38,306
Probably didn't even hear it coming.

7
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:41,526
Hey, where's Tony?

8
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:42,977
I don't know.

9
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,279
I offered to give him a lift,

10
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:46,314
but he said someone would pick him up.

11
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:47,815
From DC to Quantico?

12
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,617
Sounded strange to me, too.

13
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,503
I don't know how he's surviving without a car.

14
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:54,923
Is that him?

15
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:57,041
No. It's Delilah.

16
00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:58,877
We're talking about sneaking away for a long weekend.

17
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,295
Nice.

18
00:02:00,297 --> 00:02:02,213
If you hens are finished,

19
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:03,882
I could do with some help.

20
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:06,017
Oh, yes.

21
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:08,386
Her name's Petty Officer Third Class Jody Ray.

22
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:10,555
Patrol spotted her body just after sunrise.

23
00:02:10,557 --> 00:02:12,006
She works at the base clinic.

24
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:13,942
Punched out just after 21:00 last night.

25
00:02:13,944 --> 00:02:15,443
And she went for a run?

26
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:17,845
Coworker said she was training for a marathon.

27
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:20,398
Had been running almost every night for the past few months.

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,783
Next of kin been notified?

29
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:23,368
CACO team is on it, sir.

30
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,686
All right, thanks.

31
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:31,025
Nice of you to join us, DiNozzo.

32
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,577
Yeah, sorry.

33
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:35,213
Hey, Jimmy.

34
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:39,300
So, what did I miss?

35
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:43,428
Who was it that drove you all the way over here?

36
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:44,223
Oh.

37
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:45,673
A friend.

38
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:47,375
No, seriously.

39
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:48,709
Seriously.

40
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,562
What should I do, photograph?

41
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:51,879
No, I already did it.

42
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:54,816
Egh. All right.

43
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:57,218
Duck?

44
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,771
Last night, 22:00 hours,

45
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:02,056
or thereabouts.

46
00:03:14,537 --> 00:03:16,237
Hey, Abbs.

47
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,738
Come up with anything?

48
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,290
Making progress.

49
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:21,509
Look, okay, this is a part

50
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:23,962
of the vehicle's headlight assembly.

51
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:25,246
What's the make and model?

52
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:27,632
There are 47 manufacturers

53
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:29,968
of cars and trucks in the United States.

54
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,937
Each one of those produces multiple models and body styles.

55
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:34,806
And the parts and the trim are redesigned every few years.

56
00:03:34,808 --> 00:03:36,441
There are zillions of possibilities.

57
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:38,092
Why would anyone assume that I could take

58
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:40,261
a teeny, tiny piece of plastic

59
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:42,363
and easily identify a vehicle?

60
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:43,598
What's the make and model?

61
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,102
A 2003 to a 2005 Dodge Ram pickup truck.

62
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:49,871
Thank you very much.

63
00:03:49,873 --> 00:03:51,439
But we're going to have to narrow it down.

64
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:52,991
There's hundreds of trucks on that base every day.

65
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:54,792
That's what I was doing when you interrupted me.

66
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:57,629
So, there was a trace of the vehicle's paint

67
00:03:57,631 --> 00:03:59,998
on Petty Officer Ray's watch.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,282
These are our color choices.

69
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:02,967
On the top we have Inferno Red.

70
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,119
And the bottom we have Deep Molten Red.

71
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,421
I don't know who comes up with these names.

72
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:07,972
What do you think?

73
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:09,588
I'm going to have to go with the top one.

74
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:10,593
Agreed.

75
00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:15,513
So Inferno Red was only available between 2005 and 2008.

76
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:18,016
So the only year in common between the headlight lens

77
00:04:18,018 --> 00:04:20,018
and the color is 2005.

78
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,972
Ergo we are looking for a red 2005 Dodge Ram pickup truck.

79
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,474
Abby, you are the best.

80
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:28,192
Still taken for granted.

81
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:31,029
Just 'cause I make it look easy doesn't mean it is.

82
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:33,948
Why do you suspect Staff Sergeant Justin Dunne?

83
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,816
Abby I.D.'d the make, model and color

84
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:37,452
of the hit-and-run vehicle.

85
00:04:37,454 --> 00:04:40,288
Only one registered on base and it belongs to Dunne.

86
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,873
I checked the gate security footage.

87
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,424
His truck never left Quantico last night.

88
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:45,710
What do we know about him? Single.

89
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:47,211
Joined the Corps right out of high school.

90
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:48,379
He's a helo mechanic.

91
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:49,931
Scheduled to deploy on an LHA

92
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:51,432
to the Med, later this week.

93
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:54,001
And most pertinent...

94
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,687
he has a DUI in his past.

95
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:57,338
Bring him in.

96
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:02,143
I love it when it all comes together so quickly.

97
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:04,145
Not me. Makes me nervous.

98
00:05:04,147 --> 00:05:05,530
Too easy.

99
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:07,282
Let's go.

100
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:09,701
You ever going to get a new car?

101
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:12,186
Well, firstly, I never buy new cars.

102
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:14,789
Secondly, I need something that ignites my passions.

103
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,207
It's like a woman.

104
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,209
I need to be in love before I commit.

105
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:20,912
You've never committed to a woman.

106
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:30,388
Sergeant Dunne. NCIS.

107
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:36,394
Sergeant Dunne!

108
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:44,051
Freeze. NCIS.

109
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,047
Yeah, that's my truck, but

110
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:59,183
I swear, I don't know how it got that way.

111
00:05:59,185 --> 00:06:01,635
You didn't drive it last night? No.

112
00:06:01,637 --> 00:06:03,303
I haven't used the truck in a couple of days.

113
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:06,440
How do you get to work? I walk. Need the exercise.

114
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:08,709
The maintenance bay isn't that far from my quarters.

115
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:10,277
Where were you last night, 22:00 hours?

116
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,113
I was in my room... asleep.

117
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:14,731
Had a tough week.

118
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:16,116
I was exhausted.

119
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:17,401
You sure you weren't drunk

120
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:19,570
and you just don't remember what you did?

121
00:06:19,572 --> 00:06:21,455
We know about your DUI.

122
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:23,490
I've been sober for 13 months.

123
00:06:23,492 --> 00:06:25,358
I go to three or four meetings a week.

124
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,911
So, if you weren't driving the pickup and you're innocent,

125
00:06:27,913 --> 00:06:29,963
why were you climbing out a window?

126
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:35,002
I know my rights.

127
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:36,767
I'm not saying any more until I have a lawyer.

128
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:37,472
Okay.

129
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:39,756
Then you can have the lawyer of your choice

130
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:43,043
or JAG will assign one to you.

131
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:48,932
Hey, McGee.

132
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:50,684
Did you bring me Sergeant Dunne's right boot?

133
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:53,820
Sorry, Abbs, he lawyered up and didn't give a permissive search.

134
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:56,857
Hmm. Well, did you get a good look at his feet?

135
00:06:56,859 --> 00:06:59,193
Huh? Well, the footprint that you cast

136
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:02,329
at the crime scene, it's a standard-issue Marine Corps

137
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:03,580
combat boot, size ten and a half.

138
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:05,582
Well, I guess he might wear that size.

139
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:07,251
It's well worn and has a very distinctive gash

140
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:08,869
in the right heel.

141
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:11,505
I'd just really love to match it to Sergeant Dunne.

142
00:07:11,507 --> 00:07:13,073
Well, you're going to have to wait till morning.

143
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:14,291
Any luck here?

144
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:17,044
Oh, this is definitely the pickup truck.

145
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:19,713
The tires match the tracks that were in the dirt.

146
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:22,466
And I got hair, blood and clothing fibers

147
00:07:22,468 --> 00:07:24,434
off the front end that match our victim.

148
00:07:24,436 --> 00:07:26,470
So, I'll get DNA confirmation in the morning,

149
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:27,971
and we should have it locked up.

150
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:31,358
Great.

151
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:34,695
Hey, have you been giving Tony rides to work

152
00:07:34,697 --> 00:07:36,146
since his car was wrecked?

153
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:37,764
No.

154
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:38,932
Hmm.

155
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:40,267
Somebody dropped him off

156
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:42,269
all the way out at Quantico this morning.

157
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:44,037
Is he dating someone?

158
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,440
Oh... I don't think so.

159
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:50,043
Hmm.

160
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:54,798
You always smell so great.

161
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,967
Let me guess-- you missed the sexual harassment meeting

162
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:58,352
again this year.

163
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:00,587
Hey, everybody, look who I found in the lobby.

164
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:01,855
Hey, Clark.

165
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,091
- Hey, guys. - Morning, Carrie.

166
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:06,476
I don't think I've had the pleasure.

167
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:07,460
Dr. Mallard,

168
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:09,796
meet former FBI agent Carrie Clark.

169
00:08:09,798 --> 00:08:10,797
Now in private law practice.

170
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:11,932
Nice to meet you, Doctor.

171
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:13,800
- Likewise. - Carrie worked

172
00:08:13,802 --> 00:08:15,686
the Norfolk side of the Port Authority case

173
00:08:15,688 --> 00:08:17,704
a few years ago, made Fornell look good.

174
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:18,855
It was a tough job.

175
00:08:18,857 --> 00:08:20,473
No, you guys made it easy.

176
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:22,442
I don't remember that case.

177
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:23,810
Grand theft, Ducky,

178
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:25,696
no autopsy, no body, no you.

179
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:26,913
Ah.

180
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:28,148
What brings you to NCIS?

181
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,833
I'm here to see Sergeant Dunne.

182
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:32,953
You're his lawyer?

183
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:35,155
- Say it ain't so. - Yes, where is he?

184
00:08:35,157 --> 00:08:37,591
Staff Sergeant Dunne's in a holding cell across the yard.

185
00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:38,925
Agent McGee can take you to him.

186
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,827
Thank you.

187
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:41,011
Good to see you guys.

188
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:45,182
- Bye. - Duck,

189
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:47,351
you can release Petty Officer Ray's body any time

190
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:48,802
you're ready.

191
00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:51,004
You notice anything different about Carrie, boss?

192
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:52,306
No wedding ring.

193
00:08:52,308 --> 00:08:53,940
Told you the husband was a handbag.

194
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:56,643
Handbag?

195
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:58,812
Something useless you hang on your arm.

196
00:08:58,814 --> 00:09:01,014
Oh.

197
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:03,033
Hey, Agent Fornell, it's DiNozzo.

198
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:05,819
Listen, can you give me the skinny

199
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:08,071
on the ever-fetching Carrie Clark?

200
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:26,306
Hello.

201
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:27,841
I'm Carrie Clark.

202
00:09:27,843 --> 00:09:29,593
Didn't expect you to look like you do.

203
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:31,645
Is that a problem?

204
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,263
Not if you're as good as my cousin said.

205
00:09:33,265 --> 00:09:35,816
Well, I haven't had any complaints.

206
00:09:37,718 --> 00:09:40,654
You're about to be arraigned on some very serious charges.

207
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:42,656
I don't know anything about a hit-and-run.

208
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:44,891
If it was my pickup, someone else was driving.

209
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:46,576
Any idea who?

210
00:09:49,063 --> 00:09:51,615
Justin, I want to believe you, but you seem very nervous.

211
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:55,085
Is there something that you want to tell me?

212
00:09:57,789 --> 00:10:00,006
Where were you at 10:00 last night?

213
00:10:00,908 --> 00:10:03,076
Doesn't matter.

214
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:04,261
Of course it does.

215
00:10:04,263 --> 00:10:05,962
- I have an alibi. - Okay.

216
00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:07,264
That's all you need to know.

217
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:10,183
Are you going to tell me?

218
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:18,258
All right, if that is going to be your attitude,

219
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,476
how about I save you some money?

220
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:21,027
JAG will assign someone to you for free.

221
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:22,195
Hold on.

222
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:25,598
Could this room be bugged?

223
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,868
No, no way-- that would be illegal.

224
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,936
Are you recording our conversation?

225
00:10:29,938 --> 00:10:31,271
No.

226
00:10:31,273 --> 00:10:32,622
You're my lawyer.

227
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:35,108
Anything I say, you can't tell anyone?

228
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,827
It's called attorney-client privilege.

229
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:38,611
Everything that you say is confidential.

230
00:10:38,613 --> 00:10:41,448
It doesn't leave this room unless you want it to.

231
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,632
Rules of ethics prohibit me

232
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:45,001
from telling anyone what we discuss.

233
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:46,553
You sure?

234
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:49,639
I promise you, Justin.

235
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:56,129
When that girl was killed,

236
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:59,516
I was 35 miles away in Falls Church.

237
00:11:00,468 --> 00:11:02,402
And what were you doing there?

238
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,858
Stabbing a guy to death.

239
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:15,332
Why are you checking airline schedules?

240
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:17,284
Miami?

241
00:11:17,286 --> 00:11:18,752
Do you have to know everything?

242
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:21,154
Yes, it's in my DNA.

243
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:24,991
Well, you're gonna drive me crazy until I tell you, so...

244
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:27,827
Things are quiet here, this case is wrapping up.

245
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:29,463
I've got a few vacation days coming,

246
00:11:29,465 --> 00:11:30,931
so Delilah and I have been talking

247
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:32,849
about getting away for a long weekend.

248
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:35,302
McGee, I'm impressed.

249
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:39,005
Miami, South Beach, hot clubs, stone crabs.

250
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:40,857
It is unlike you.

251
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:44,010
I knew I shouldn't have said anything.

252
00:11:44,845 --> 00:11:47,030
Oh.

253
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:48,365
That didn't take long.

254
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:49,649
Your client come to his senses?

255
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:51,017
Wants to confess?

256
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:52,319
No.

257
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:54,070
Wants to make a deal, then?

258
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:56,022
Sergeant Dunne says he's innocent.

259
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:57,290
Innocent?

260
00:11:57,292 --> 00:11:59,876
We've forensically tied his pickup to the victim.

261
00:11:59,878 --> 00:12:02,212
He ran when we tried to question him.

262
00:12:02,214 --> 00:12:04,030
He claims he has an alibi.

263
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:05,832
Well, what is it? We'll check it out.

264
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:08,084
Well, it is not that simple, Gibbs,

265
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:09,536
he told me in confidence.

266
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:10,837
It's privileged.

267
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:11,871
If he doesn't want to tell you himself,

268
00:12:11,873 --> 00:12:13,706
then my hands are tied.

269
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,209
We've got 48 hours to either charge him or let him go.

270
00:12:19,313 --> 00:12:20,897
Give us something.

271
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:24,935
All right, listen, I will go check out his alibi myself

272
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:26,903
and I will get back to you.

273
00:12:30,724 --> 00:12:32,242
The guy's facing vehicular homicide

274
00:12:32,244 --> 00:12:33,910
and hit-and-run charges.

275
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:35,445
He won't use an alibi?

276
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:37,664
Is he crazy?

277
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,956
Abbs.

278
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,526
Gibbs... you're amazing.

279
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:03,332
How did you know that someone else was driving the truck?

280
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:05,251
What'd you find?

281
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:06,802
Well, it's more what I didn't find that's interesting.

282
00:13:06,804 --> 00:13:08,838
I mean, before you called, I was just trying

283
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,474
to match the victim to the vehicle, which I did.

284
00:13:11,476 --> 00:13:12,842
- But? - But then, when you asked me

285
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:14,343
if there's a chance that someone

286
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:16,762
other than the owner of the truck was driving,

287
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:19,065
I dusted the whole thing for prints, I didn't find any.

288
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:21,267
- Just Staff Sergeant Dunne's? - No.

289
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:24,820
I mean, like none, nada, zip, zilch, nothing.

290
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:26,856
Almost the entire surface of the truck

291
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:28,607
was wiped clean of fingerprints--

292
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:30,225
the door handle, the steering wheel, the gearshift,

293
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,662
the seat adjuster, everything.

294
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,500
Now, I got reminded o-of my Uncle Horace.

295
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:38,901
He was always losing things

296
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:41,337
like his glasses and his wallet and his keys.

297
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,955
He got locked out of his own car so many times

298
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:45,908
that he, he hid a key on his car.

299
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,712
And then I found... this...

300
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:52,598
...under the front wheel well.

301
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,849
Wiped clean?

302
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:56,719
Oh, yeah, including the key inside.

303
00:13:56,721 --> 00:14:00,272
That is hardly something that the owner would do.

304
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:02,224
Someone else was driving the truck.

305
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:04,977
Yes, and they tried to make it look like they weren't.

306
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:08,280
Thanks, Abbs.

307
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:15,604
I don't understand why people run.

308
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,290
Oh, well, it's therapeutic,

309
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,959
it has great cardiovascular benefits.

310
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:22,277
What's more, it gets the old endorphins pumping.

311
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,131
I'll tell you, running gives me a great high.

312
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:27,583
I was referring to the driver

313
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:29,835
running from the scene of the accident, Mr. Palmer.

314
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:31,837
Oh, yes, yes.

315
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,423
Did you know that pedestrian hit-and-runs are

316
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:36,625
at an epidemic rate in this country?

317
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,260
Nearly 11%

318
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:40,679
of all traffic accidents in the United States are

319
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:42,148
hit-and-runs.

320
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,232
That Petty Officer Ray?

321
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:44,400
Yes.

322
00:14:44,402 --> 00:14:45,985
Hold on to the body for a little while longer,

323
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:47,019
will you, Duck?

324
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:48,020
You signed the release.

325
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:49,104
Has something changed?

326
00:14:49,106 --> 00:14:51,490
Yeah.

327
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,476
But I don't know what.

328
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,496
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

329
00:14:57,498 --> 00:14:58,447
Hi, it's Carrie Clark.

330
00:14:58,449 --> 00:14:59,665
Yeah, Carrie, what do you got?

331
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,167
Well, Dunne's alibi

332
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:02,818
checks out, it's solid.

333
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,486
Mm-hmm, tell me. I can't.

334
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,321
You're going to have to start looking

335
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,040
for the real hit-and-run driver because it's not my client.

336
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:11,093
Carrie, look, I can't just take your word for it, okay?

337
00:15:11,095 --> 00:15:12,595
Give me something here.

338
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:14,957
You're gonna have to figure this one out on your own, Gibbs.

339
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,805
Jethro, is something wrong?

340
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,481
Looks like you won't be leaving us today after all,

341
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:34,733
my dear.

342
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,189
McGee,

343
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,908
trace the last call, will you?

344
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,477
You want me to find out who it was from?

345
00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:45,795
It was from Carrie Clark.

346
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:48,196
Usually her name comes up on that little window there.

347
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,911
This time it didn't; it was just a number.

348
00:15:49,936 --> 00:15:50,952
Hmm.

349
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:54,887
What did she say?

350
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,872
Said her client's alibi checked out.

351
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,257
I don't believe it.

352
00:15:58,259 --> 00:15:59,840
Well, the number belongs to a pay phone.

353
00:15:59,865 --> 00:16:00,894
Pay phone?

354
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:02,144
I didn't think there were any left.

355
00:16:02,146 --> 00:16:05,097
325 Acacia Avenue in Falls Church.

356
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:06,214
It's in front of the library.

357
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,549
Carrie has a cell.

358
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,101
Why would she use a pay phone?

359
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:10,269
Not sure.

360
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:13,221
She knows her client's alibi.

361
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,908
She knows she can't tell us.

362
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,993
What are you thinking, boss?

363
00:16:17,995 --> 00:16:19,895
Carrie knows we'll be intrigued,

364
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:22,081
she knows that we'll trace the call.

365
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,749
Did she just drop a bread crumb?

366
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:26,085
Yeah. Go. Go on.

367
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,348
There's the pay phone.

368
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,250
Why was Carrie calling from here?

369
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,771
Library, hardware store?

370
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:49,257
Oh, there we go, Great Sexpectations.

371
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,527
I seriously doubt it, Tony.

372
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,514
Hey, there's a squad car.

373
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,753
Yeah, let's check it out.

374
00:17:04,492 --> 00:17:06,575
Did you ever find out if Carrie was divorced?

375
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:08,377
Ah. Trial separation.

376
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:09,578
She's not wearing her ring.

377
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,963
You know what that means.

378
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:12,464
It's over.

379
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,918
Hey.

380
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,670
NCIS.

381
00:17:17,672 --> 00:17:19,388
Special Agents DiNozzo and McGee.

382
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,123
Dockry, Homicide.

383
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,808
Homicide?

384
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,143
What are you guys up to?

385
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:26,294
Oh, just pounding the pavement, boring Navy stuff.

386
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,647
Yeah, nothing serious like homicide.

387
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:30,816
Who's dead?

388
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:33,152
Store owner-- Donny Sullivan.

389
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:34,570
Stabbed to death night before last.

390
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:38,273
Body was found in the upstairs residence yesterday morning by an employee.

391
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:40,475
Any leads? Nothing concrete yet.

392
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:41,810
Anything I can help you guys with?

393
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:43,078
Ah, no, we got to go.

394
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,246
He gets hungry.

395
00:17:44,248 --> 00:17:46,115
It's true. See you around.

396
00:17:46,117 --> 00:17:50,200
Hey, do you guys know a Special Agent Gibbs?

397
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:54,123
Oh, yeah, we affectionately refer to him as "boss."

398
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,375
Tell him Hickory's son said hi.

399
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:57,492
Hickory?

400
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:58,827
He'll know.

401
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,517
The storekeeper's murder happened about the same time as the hit-and-run.

402
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,303
Think this has something to do with Dunne's alibi?

403
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:12,141
If Dunne was involved, then how'd he get from Quantico to here and back?

404
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:13,809
His truck never left the base.

405
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:16,695
I think your amorous little weekend in Miami just went bye-bye.

406
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:18,280
Yeah. Gibbs. Hey, boss.

407
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:19,865
We might have a lead on Dunne's alibi.

408
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:23,902
Find out what you can-- discreetly, DiNozzo.

409
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:26,038
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, so I told you that I dusted

410
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,207
the entire truck for prints, but I didn't.

411
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:30,409
I only dusted the places that a person would touch,

412
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:32,044
and then I realized that if someone's going

413
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:34,163
to adjust the seat lever, which they did,

414
00:18:34,165 --> 00:18:37,032
they would probably also adjust the rearview mirror.

415
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,384
And guess what I found--

416
00:18:38,386 --> 00:18:40,886
a fresh right thumbprint on its backside.

417
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:42,054
Thumbprint have a name?

418
00:18:42,056 --> 00:18:44,173
Don't be silly, Gibbs,

419
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:46,475
thumbprints don't have names.

420
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,678
People do.

421
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,715
My first pass was to run it against all the personnel at Quantico.

422
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:56,718
And that's all I had to do.

423
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,654
Private Daniel Cliff.

424
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,245
Gibbs will be in, in a minute.

425
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,447
Thank you.

426
00:19:08,449 --> 00:19:10,416
You know why they brought me over here?

427
00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:11,750
No.

428
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:14,369
I told them I wouldn't say anything else until my lawyer was present.

429
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:16,422
Well, I checked your alibi.

430
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:18,340
You weren't lying.

431
00:19:18,342 --> 00:19:20,759
Hey, you don't know who's on the other side of that glass.

432
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:22,410
Let's not discuss it again.

433
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,763
You know all you have to.

434
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:25,931
I'm innocent.

435
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,968
Couldn't this have waited till the morning?

436
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,770
Nope.

437
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,107
You know him? Yeah,

438
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,975
Private Cliff-- I see him around.

439
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:38,393
You two close?

440
00:19:38,395 --> 00:19:40,279
No.

441
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:43,449
We hung a couple of times back when I was drinking.

442
00:19:43,451 --> 00:19:44,933
That was a long time ago.

443
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,618
Have you seen each other lately?

444
00:19:48,205 --> 00:19:51,323
Run into him in the laundry, rec room, that's it.

445
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:53,292
You give Private Cliff permission

446
00:19:53,294 --> 00:19:54,660
to drive your pickup truck?

447
00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:57,830
Hell, no.

448
00:19:57,832 --> 00:19:59,298
What was that about?

449
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,556
Gibbs? Sounds like you have a suspect for your hit-and-run.

450
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:10,225
You gonna let my client go? Not yet.

451
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:11,593
Come on. He's due to deploy.

452
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:14,263
Haven't brought Private Cliff in for questioning yet.

453
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:15,814
Well, your 48-hour clock is ticking.

454
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:16,815
If you don't charge my client by tomorrow,

455
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:18,150
you have to let him go.

456
00:20:18,152 --> 00:20:19,852
You know, a funny thing happened.

457
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:21,436
We got a tip.

458
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:23,906
Sent us to a cigar store in Falls Church.

459
00:20:23,908 --> 00:20:25,073
Really?

460
00:20:25,075 --> 00:20:28,026
Yeah, it was a crime scene, a homicide.

461
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:33,615
If your client wasn't driving his truck on base the other night,

462
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:37,152
could he have been in Falls Church?

463
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:43,091
My only concern is Sergeant Dunne's rights.

464
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:45,493
He wasn't involved in the hit-and-run.

465
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,185
Hmm.

466
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:56,138
A non-denial denial.

467
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,308
Jason Robards, as Ben Bradlee in All the President's Men.

468
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,676
She didn't say "no."

469
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:16,212
Oh, you're crazy.

470
00:21:16,214 --> 00:21:19,048
No, you must need glasses.

471
00:21:20,084 --> 00:21:22,669
Yeah, yeah. All right, later.

472
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:24,839
What's so funny?

473
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,557
That was Hollander in HR.

474
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,392
She claims that she saw you this morning

475
00:21:28,394 --> 00:21:30,811
at the front gate getting off a city bus.

476
00:21:30,813 --> 00:21:32,379
Yeah, that was me.

477
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:34,732
Listen, I know I made fun of you in the past for riding the bus,

478
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:37,768
but I have to admit I was wrong.

479
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,353
I've been using public transportation,

480
00:21:39,355 --> 00:21:40,654
and I really like it.

481
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:42,523
You're kidding. No.

482
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:43,724
I have time to read,

483
00:21:43,726 --> 00:21:45,826
make some calls and, best of all...

484
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:47,394
I get to watch people.

485
00:21:47,396 --> 00:21:48,746
People are fascinating.

486
00:21:48,748 --> 00:21:50,897
Okay, Tony, I'm...

487
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:54,201
I don't even know what I am right now.

488
00:21:54,203 --> 00:21:56,503
But I know you, and this is not you.

489
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:59,506
Boss, I went through Sergeant Dunne's e-mails,

490
00:21:59,508 --> 00:22:00,907
phone calls and credit cards.

491
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:02,626
I came up empty.

492
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:05,512
There's no connecting him to the dead cigar-store owner.

493
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:08,582
What would his motive be to kill the guy?

494
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:12,603
Did find out Dunne exchanged a lot of calls with a Maryland cell phone number.

495
00:22:12,605 --> 00:22:14,254
Belongs to an Olivia Chandler.

496
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:15,723
Yeah, well, find out who she is.

497
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:18,192
Yup.

498
00:22:18,194 --> 00:22:19,860
Hmm. Do we dare run Sergeant Dunne's name by Falls Church PD,

499
00:22:19,862 --> 00:22:22,262
see if they can make a connection?

500
00:22:22,264 --> 00:22:23,480
Can't do that.

501
00:22:23,482 --> 00:22:25,098
Got to protect Carrie Clark.

502
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,567
You can do it off the record.

503
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:29,119
The homicide detective in charge seemed to know you.

504
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:32,539
Who? Well, he said to tell you,

505
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,274
"Hickory's son says hello."

506
00:22:34,276 --> 00:22:36,543
That's Paul Dockry.

507
00:22:36,545 --> 00:22:38,829
Hickory Dickory Dockry.

508
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:41,281
His dad and I were in the Corps together.

509
00:22:41,283 --> 00:22:44,134
Come on, DiNozzo. You're with me.

510
00:22:44,136 --> 00:22:46,920
Huh. People are fascinating.

511
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,485
This boot print was found at a crime scene

512
00:23:01,487 --> 00:23:03,487
that killed a petty officer.

513
00:23:03,489 --> 00:23:06,306
This is the same boot, the same cutout at the right heel.

514
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:07,775
And you know what else, Cliff?

515
00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:09,743
We got your thumbprint on the rearview mirror

516
00:23:09,745 --> 00:23:11,245
of that vehicle.

517
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:13,914
What happened?

518
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,784
It was dark.

519
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:18,652
I couldn't see her until it was too late.

520
00:23:18,654 --> 00:23:20,587
What were you doing with Staff Sergeant Dunne's truck?

521
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:22,089
I had a few drinks.

522
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:23,507
I know this girl in Stafford.

523
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:25,376
I overheard Dunne in the rec room.

524
00:23:25,378 --> 00:23:27,294
Said he had a rough week and was gonna hit the rack early.

525
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:28,462
Figured I'd take his truck and be back

526
00:23:28,464 --> 00:23:29,680
before he even missed it. Bull!

527
00:23:29,682 --> 00:23:31,632
How'd you know about the hidden key?

528
00:23:31,634 --> 00:23:33,350
About a year ago, when he was still drinking,

529
00:23:33,352 --> 00:23:35,335
he got wasted, locked himself out of his truck.

530
00:23:35,337 --> 00:23:37,337
Got the hidden key out, had me drive him home.

531
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:39,447
You left an injured woman to die by the side of the road?

532
00:23:39,472 --> 00:23:40,442
No!

533
00:23:40,443 --> 00:23:41,675
I stopped.

534
00:23:41,677 --> 00:23:43,110
I knew she was dead,

535
00:23:43,112 --> 00:23:44,778
and I realized how bad it all looked.

536
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,531
I was drinking, I was driving a stolen vehicle.

537
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:49,566
I just panicked and drove back to the parking lot.

538
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:51,618
You got to believe me.

539
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,187
It was an accident.

540
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,199
I'll book him. Uh-uh.

541
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:07,584
If we charge Private Cliff

542
00:24:07,586 --> 00:24:09,053
with the hit-and-run,

543
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:11,288
we got to let Staff Sergeant Dunne go.

544
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,840
I'm not ready to do that.

545
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:14,374
We only have a few more hours

546
00:24:14,376 --> 00:24:15,759
until the clock runs out on Dunne.

547
00:24:15,761 --> 00:24:18,479
Put him in a holding cell.

548
00:24:26,654 --> 00:24:28,639
Hey, Paul. Hey, Gibbs.

549
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:30,207
Sorry. Just give me a sec.

550
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:31,675
I got to finish this text to my daughter.

551
00:24:31,677 --> 00:24:33,243
Only way she'll communicate me.

552
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:36,029
The kid never answers her phone.

553
00:24:36,031 --> 00:24:38,064
Been a long time.

554
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:39,833
How's your dad?

555
00:24:39,835 --> 00:24:42,068
Stubborn as always.

556
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,872
Thought I might run into you at my kid sister's wedding.

557
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:47,841
Oh, no, no. I'm not... I'm not big on weddings.

558
00:24:47,843 --> 00:24:49,460
I can understand that.

559
00:24:49,462 --> 00:24:52,763
Thanks for meeting me.

560
00:24:52,765 --> 00:24:56,300
Yeah. I ran into your agents in Falls Church.

561
00:24:56,302 --> 00:24:58,302
Taking it, that wasn't a coincidence.

562
00:24:58,304 --> 00:24:59,853
Uh, no. So,

563
00:24:59,855 --> 00:25:01,722
what's your interest in my homicide?

564
00:25:01,724 --> 00:25:04,257
Well, it's complicated, messy.

565
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:05,809
Following a lead.

566
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:07,361
Holding someone on an unrelated charge.

567
00:25:07,363 --> 00:25:09,446
Seems to have an alibi,

568
00:25:09,448 --> 00:25:11,782
but he may have been involved with your dead storekeeper

569
00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:14,118
Like to talk to him. Can't let you, not yet.

570
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,903
Still trying to protect a source.

571
00:25:15,905 --> 00:25:17,704
You have him in custody.

572
00:25:17,706 --> 00:25:19,606
Yeah, for the time being.

573
00:25:19,608 --> 00:25:22,326
What can you tell me about your case?

574
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:24,378
Discovered Sullivan was a bookie.

575
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,380
Used the cigar store as a front.

576
00:25:26,382 --> 00:25:27,915
Guy you holding like to gamble?

577
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,082
I'll find out.

578
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:30,884
You got any suspects for the murder?

579
00:25:30,886 --> 00:25:34,621
Yes... and no.

580
00:25:34,623 --> 00:25:37,891
Loser with a mile-long rap sheet, Wendell Kaiser.

581
00:25:37,893 --> 00:25:39,643
Into Sullivan big-time.

582
00:25:39,645 --> 00:25:40,961
Very public arguments.

583
00:25:40,963 --> 00:25:42,479
Kaiser even makes threats.

584
00:25:42,481 --> 00:25:43,647
However, airtight alibi.

585
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:45,182
In New York at the time of the murder.

586
00:25:45,184 --> 00:25:47,100
Just got back this morning. Hmm.

587
00:25:47,102 --> 00:25:49,236
Maybe alibis are in season, huh?

588
00:25:49,238 --> 00:25:50,571
Okay.

589
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:51,738
Cheeseburger,

590
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,991
no dressing, fries.

591
00:25:55,493 --> 00:25:58,078
Did I miss something? You didn't even order.

592
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,680
Well, he doesn't have to.

593
00:26:00,582 --> 00:26:01,665
Thanks, Elaine.

594
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:05,364
Can you, uh, get me Kaiser's file?

595
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:06,320
Sure.

596
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:08,455
I'll e-mail you the highlights.

597
00:26:08,457 --> 00:26:10,424
Your guy wouldn't happen to be a hit man for hire, would he?

598
00:26:10,426 --> 00:26:12,125
No. I don't think so.

599
00:26:14,295 --> 00:26:15,963
What? Need something?

600
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:19,132
Yeah, a knife to cut this beast.

601
00:26:25,006 --> 00:26:26,190
That'll work.

602
00:26:26,192 --> 00:26:28,775
No, no, no.

603
00:26:28,777 --> 00:26:30,477
You're not serious.

604
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,945
There's no way she's married to him.

605
00:26:31,947 --> 00:26:34,064
Almost five years.

606
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,899
The very definition of a trophy wife.

607
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:38,118
What you looking at? Olivia Chandler.

608
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,404
The woman who Sergeant Dunne

609
00:26:40,406 --> 00:26:42,155
has been exchanging texts and calls with.

610
00:26:42,157 --> 00:26:43,724
That little man

611
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:45,075
must have a big,

612
00:26:45,077 --> 00:26:48,829
big... bank account. She's married to him.

613
00:26:48,831 --> 00:26:50,797
They live together in Chevy Chase Village.

614
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,216
Very la-dee-dah.

615
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:54,868
Only thing on her record is a DUI.

616
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,754
She was picked up for driving erratically in her Aston Martin.

617
00:26:57,756 --> 00:26:58,872
So many jokes.

618
00:26:58,874 --> 00:27:00,390
Of course she drives an Aston Martin.

619
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:02,593
When I was searching traffic cameras

620
00:27:02,595 --> 00:27:04,978
to see if I could place Dunne anywhere near the cigar store

621
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,430
the night of the murder,

622
00:27:06,432 --> 00:27:08,381
I found something interesting.

623
00:27:08,383 --> 00:27:09,549
Olivia Chandler's car.

624
00:27:09,551 --> 00:27:12,486
Now, this was taken a block from the cigar store.

625
00:27:12,488 --> 00:27:13,987
Because of the tinted windows,

626
00:27:13,989 --> 00:27:15,555
you can't make out who's inside.

627
00:27:15,557 --> 00:27:16,940
I sent it to Abby.

628
00:27:16,942 --> 00:27:19,610
It's a long shot, but maybe she can enhance the image.

629
00:27:19,612 --> 00:27:20,727
Sullivan was a bookie.

630
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:23,080
Falls Church police had a suspect,

631
00:27:23,082 --> 00:27:24,581
but he has an alibi.

632
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,950
Detective Dockry said he was going to e-mail the file.

633
00:27:26,952 --> 00:27:29,670
He did.

634
00:27:29,672 --> 00:27:31,404
Wendell Kaiser. McGee--

635
00:27:31,406 --> 00:27:33,507
see if Staff Sergeant Dunne had a gambling problem

636
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:34,791
or any connection to this guy.

637
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:37,344
DiNozzo...

638
00:27:37,346 --> 00:27:41,765
check out Olivia Chandler.

639
00:27:43,384 --> 00:27:45,251
With pleasure.

640
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:46,770
Thank you, boss.

641
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:17,283
May I help you?

642
00:28:17,285 --> 00:28:18,585
Oh, I hope so.

643
00:28:18,587 --> 00:28:21,421
NCIS Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

644
00:28:21,423 --> 00:28:22,839
NCIS

645
00:28:22,841 --> 00:28:25,092
I love this car. It's smoking hot.

646
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:26,677
I'm in the market myself.

647
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:28,178
Between vehicles right now.

648
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,681
Terrible gas mileage, but that's what James Bond drives.

649
00:28:30,683 --> 00:28:31,982
Did you know that?

650
00:28:31,984 --> 00:28:34,935
I have no idea. What do you want?

651
00:28:34,937 --> 00:28:38,304
Oh, we're investigating a Marine.

652
00:28:38,306 --> 00:28:39,906
Staff Sergeant Justin Dunne.

653
00:28:39,908 --> 00:28:40,974
How do you know him?

654
00:28:40,976 --> 00:28:42,442
-I don't. -Really?

655
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:44,194
'Cause you exchanged a lot of calls with him,

656
00:28:44,196 --> 00:28:45,478
and that would suggest otherwise.

657
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,748
We met at an A.A. meeting.

658
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,533
We talk to each other for support.

659
00:28:49,535 --> 00:28:51,484
Sobriety is an ongoing battle.

660
00:28:51,486 --> 00:28:52,819
So why'd you say you didn't know him?

661
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:55,789
The second "A" in A.A. is for "anonymous."

662
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:57,958
I shouldn't be talking about him or anyone else.

663
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,509
Gotcha.

664
00:28:59,511 --> 00:29:01,094
So you're taking a little trip?

665
00:29:02,296 --> 00:29:04,431
I'm going to Jamaica with some girlfriends.

666
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:06,516
Yeah, mon. Jamaica.

667
00:29:06,518 --> 00:29:09,002
Well, have yourself a nice time.

668
00:29:12,974 --> 00:29:15,392
Did you connect Staff Sergeant Dunne to the dead bookie

669
00:29:15,394 --> 00:29:17,010
or the Falls Church suspect?

670
00:29:17,012 --> 00:29:18,562
No, not yet.

671
00:29:18,564 --> 00:29:20,280
Based on the people I've talked to,

672
00:29:20,282 --> 00:29:21,681
it appears that Dunne's not a gambler.

673
00:29:21,683 --> 00:29:23,233
I still have other avenues to pursue,

674
00:29:23,235 --> 00:29:25,736
I just haven't had the time to do it all.

675
00:29:26,905 --> 00:29:29,790
- Tony, you got something? - Oh, yeah.

676
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:31,958
You won't believe how hot Olivia Chandler is.

677
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,460
Photos don't do her justice.

678
00:29:33,462 --> 00:29:35,045
What's with her and Staff Sergeant Dunne?

679
00:29:35,047 --> 00:29:36,413
Well, she claims they're only acquaintances

680
00:29:36,415 --> 00:29:37,530
from A.A. meetings.

681
00:29:37,532 --> 00:29:39,132
But I think it's more than that.

682
00:29:39,134 --> 00:29:41,084
You said you had Dunne's credit card charges-- put them up.

683
00:29:41,086 --> 00:29:43,303
-Why? -Trust me, put them up there.

684
00:29:46,307 --> 00:29:48,642
All right, what are we looking for?

685
00:29:48,644 --> 00:29:49,976
Well, if they're doing what I think they're doing,

686
00:29:49,978 --> 00:29:51,311
they're not doing it at her place.

687
00:29:51,313 --> 00:29:54,231
And I don't think a rich housewife from Chevy Chase

688
00:29:54,233 --> 00:29:56,933
is dragging those long legs all the way down to Quantico.

689
00:29:56,935 --> 00:29:58,185
Okay, wait. Hold on.

690
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:00,987
Chevy Chase Lodge.

691
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:02,606
There, there and there.

692
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:04,808
Three nights, probably more.

693
00:30:07,078 --> 00:30:08,695
Take it down, McGee.

694
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:13,700
Our 48 hours are up.

695
00:30:13,702 --> 00:30:15,502
Yep.

696
00:30:15,504 --> 00:30:17,838
When do I get my truck back?

697
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:28,641
I'm going to check out the Chevy Chase Lodge.

698
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:32,185
Book Private Cliff for the hit-and-run.

699
00:30:34,188 --> 00:30:37,774
That's one case closed, another wide open.

700
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:50,633
<i>Yes, dear, I understand.</i>

701
00:30:50,635 --> 00:30:51,834
<i>Do you?</i>

702
00:30:51,836 --> 00:30:53,469
-Do you even hear? -I hear you.

703
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:55,855
No, no, no. I-I would never...

704
00:30:57,675 --> 00:30:59,142
Well... oh, it's your mother's idea?

705
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:00,476
Yes, it's my mother's idea!

706
00:31:00,478 --> 00:31:02,562
Why does that not surprise me?

707
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:05,848
I have to go. I have a guest waiting.

708
00:31:07,202 --> 00:31:08,518
I do have a guest waiting.

709
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,518
I'm not making that up.

710
00:31:12,523 --> 00:31:15,858
Uh... could you help me, please, sir?

711
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,160
Who is that? Hello?

712
00:31:17,162 --> 00:31:18,411
Okay. I'll call you later.

713
00:31:18,413 --> 00:31:20,213
Fine! Like hell I will.

714
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,249
You married?

715
00:31:23,251 --> 00:31:24,917
Oh. No. Uh...

716
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:26,552
I'm a federal agent.

717
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:27,637
DiNozzo.

718
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:29,205
Like to ask a few questions.

719
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:30,973
All right, federal agent, ask away.

720
00:31:30,975 --> 00:31:32,391
Have you seen this man?

721
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:33,375
Yeah.

722
00:31:33,377 --> 00:31:34,560
Yeah, sure.

723
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:36,712
Sort of a regular.

724
00:31:36,714 --> 00:31:37,680
Mmm?

725
00:31:37,682 --> 00:31:39,265
So, does he come alone or...?

726
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:41,550
Well, he'd like me to think that.

727
00:31:41,552 --> 00:31:44,487
No, his friend never comes to the lobby.

728
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:46,856
He parks the car, and she goes directly to the room.

729
00:31:46,858 --> 00:31:50,159
So you got to figure, you know, one or both are married, right?

730
00:31:50,161 --> 00:31:52,445
Right. Yeah.

731
00:31:52,447 --> 00:31:54,230
So you've never seen her?

732
00:31:54,232 --> 00:31:56,582
Well, actually, I did the old

733
00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:58,584
knock-on-the-wrong-door routine one time.

734
00:31:58,586 --> 00:32:00,286
She look like this?

735
00:32:00,288 --> 00:32:01,871
Yeah, that's her.

736
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:03,873
Woman like that, you do not forget.

737
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:07,593
Right? I mean, can you imagine what one night with...

738
00:32:10,248 --> 00:32:12,048
I swear, the old witch is psychic.

739
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,917
If I have so much as a thought of another woman...

740
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:16,135
You don't have to answer that.

741
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:17,270
I have to. What...?!

742
00:32:17,272 --> 00:32:18,805
...do you want?

743
00:32:18,807 --> 00:32:19,922
I got it. Good luck.

744
00:32:19,924 --> 00:32:20,973
Just, do you need... if...

745
00:32:20,975 --> 00:32:22,108
Take a card, sir.

746
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,727
Thank you.

747
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,983
Here.

748
00:32:32,736 --> 00:32:35,922
Ah, always enjoy having a drink with you, Duck,

749
00:32:35,924 --> 00:32:39,091
but this isn't exactly on your way home from the symphony.

750
00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:40,393
What's on your mind?

751
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:42,995
Well, curiously, I was about to ask you that.

752
00:32:42,997 --> 00:32:45,081
You've seemed... troubled

753
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:48,134
since you took that call in Autopsy yesterday.

754
00:32:48,136 --> 00:32:52,805
Usually you're a master at hiding your feelings.

755
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:54,123
That your professional opinion?

756
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:55,474
The occupational hazard

757
00:32:55,476 --> 00:32:57,343
of working with a profiler.

758
00:32:57,345 --> 00:32:58,811
Mmm.

759
00:32:58,813 --> 00:33:01,463
Yeah, I'm fine.

760
00:33:01,465 --> 00:33:05,318
A little concerned about Carrie Clark.

761
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,520
The lawyer? Yeah, she's good.

762
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:11,140
She got her client released without being charged.

763
00:33:11,142 --> 00:33:13,976
I sense a "but."

764
00:33:13,978 --> 00:33:17,980
Well, she does have a conscience.

765
00:33:17,982 --> 00:33:19,832
Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?

766
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:23,319
We learned some things about her client

767
00:33:23,321 --> 00:33:27,323
that she may or may not have led us to.

768
00:33:27,325 --> 00:33:29,125
Privileged information?

769
00:33:29,127 --> 00:33:32,295
Doc, I got to be careful how I handle this.

770
00:33:32,297 --> 00:33:34,830
For Carrie's sake.

771
00:33:34,832 --> 00:33:36,716
She could get disbarred.

772
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:38,384
Well, I know you, Jethro.

773
00:33:38,386 --> 00:33:42,555
It sounds as if she's doing the right thing, as you are.

774
00:33:42,557 --> 00:33:45,174
So how was the concert?

775
00:33:45,176 --> 00:33:48,477
Great. Tchaikovsky's Second.

776
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:51,898
I never realized that he wrote music for the movies.

777
00:34:02,794 --> 00:34:04,794
That's a car I've always had the hots for.

778
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:06,879
Maybe that's what I should get.

779
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:08,414
It's too old.

780
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:09,916
You can't drive a car like that.

781
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,217
It's not practical.

782
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,335
That's the problem with you, McGeezer.

783
00:34:12,337 --> 00:34:13,419
Everything has to be practical.

784
00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:15,004
What...

785
00:34:15,006 --> 00:34:17,039
What I mean is, I've never known you

786
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,175
to do anything even a little risqué.

787
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:23,545
Tony, you have no idea what I do on my time off.

788
00:34:23,547 --> 00:34:24,897
You know, that's true, I don't.

789
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:25,965
Why don't you tell me?

790
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:30,236
Share. Rock me. Sock me.

791
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:36,859
Well, there's Wendell Kaiser.

792
00:34:36,861 --> 00:34:39,779
Wonder if Falls Church PD is tailing him, too.

793
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:41,397
Kaiser's their suspect.

794
00:34:58,298 --> 00:34:59,932
Is Kaiser going to church?

795
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:01,450
No. It's an A.A. meeting.

796
00:35:01,452 --> 00:35:03,419
They meet here every morning at this time.

797
00:35:03,421 --> 00:35:05,304
Wait, how do you know that?

798
00:35:05,306 --> 00:35:06,639
Anthony!

799
00:35:06,641 --> 00:35:08,391
What are you doing here?

800
00:35:08,393 --> 00:35:09,809
Your meeting's not until tonight.

801
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:12,261
Reverend Miller, I, uh... - Bringing a new member?

802
00:35:12,263 --> 00:35:13,562
Um...

803
00:35:13,564 --> 00:35:15,815
He's thinking about it. A little gun-shy.

804
00:35:15,817 --> 00:35:18,034
McGee, the Rev.

805
00:35:18,036 --> 00:35:19,618
Please join us.

806
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,704
It's a very safe place.

807
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:23,622
All are welcome.

808
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:29,161
Tony, what's going on?

809
00:35:29,163 --> 00:35:30,329
Do you have a drinking problem?

810
00:35:30,331 --> 00:35:32,915
No. No, I just...

811
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:35,251
I joined this men's support group.

812
00:35:35,253 --> 00:35:37,003
Meets in the church hall two nights a week.

813
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:38,620
You serious?

814
00:35:38,622 --> 00:35:40,456
Mm-hmm.

815
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,558
I know, it...

816
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,427
it doesn't sound like me, but...

817
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:47,680
with the past year, I just...

818
00:35:47,682 --> 00:35:49,982
wanted to shake things up a little bit.

819
00:35:49,984 --> 00:35:51,633
Meet some new people.

820
00:35:51,635 --> 00:35:53,302
This guy at the gym told me about the group,

821
00:35:53,304 --> 00:35:55,905
and I thought it sounded like a good idea.

822
00:35:55,907 --> 00:35:58,024
And it... it is, it's fun.

823
00:35:59,443 --> 00:36:02,578
The Rev drove me to Quantico the other morning.

824
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,979
Interesting guy.

825
00:36:03,981 --> 00:36:05,981
He's helping me be less judgmental.

826
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:10,503
You know, Kaiser's going to be here for a while.

827
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:12,321
We should get back.

828
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:25,184
Sergeant Dunne, Olivia Chandler and Wendell Kaiser

829
00:36:25,186 --> 00:36:27,136
all have one thing in common.

830
00:36:27,138 --> 00:36:28,938
They all go to A.A. meetings.

831
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,356
That's probably where they met.

832
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:33,025
The sergeant and the trophy wife are lovers.

833
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:34,643
The desk clerk at the Chevy Chase Lodge

834
00:36:34,645 --> 00:36:36,612
said that they were regulars.

835
00:36:36,614 --> 00:36:38,514
It's just like that movie <i>Body Heat.</i>

836
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:40,182
William Hurt and Kathleen Turner.

837
00:36:40,184 --> 00:36:42,017
God, she was really something, boss.

838
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:43,402
A head turner.

839
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:46,822
But I digress.

840
00:36:46,824 --> 00:36:49,625
Anyway, they were young lovers, just like these two,

841
00:36:49,627 --> 00:36:51,710
and they wanted the rich husband's money

842
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:52,878
and him out of the way.

843
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,463
On the other hand, you've got

844
00:36:54,465 --> 00:36:55,998
Wendell Kaiser, who's deep in debt to his bookie

845
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,550
and needs him off his back.

846
00:36:57,552 --> 00:36:59,585
So they help each other out and switch murders.

847
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:01,137
While Kaiser was in New York,

848
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:03,472
Dunne killed the bookie with Olivia's help.

849
00:37:03,474 --> 00:37:05,841
She drove him. Her car was in the vicinity.

850
00:37:05,843 --> 00:37:07,843
Who would ever suspect them?

851
00:37:07,845 --> 00:37:09,645
I mean, there's no connection, no motive.

852
00:37:09,647 --> 00:37:12,181
Tomorrow Sergeant Dunne is going to deploy

853
00:37:12,183 --> 00:37:14,266
and Olivia Chandler is off to Jamaica.

854
00:37:14,268 --> 00:37:16,485
And I'm betting that while they're away,

855
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:18,154
her husband's going to have a terrible accident

856
00:37:18,156 --> 00:37:19,822
at the hands of Mr. Kaiser here,

857
00:37:19,824 --> 00:37:22,024
a man with whom he has no connection.

858
00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:24,893
Two murders, three solid alibis.

859
00:37:24,895 --> 00:37:26,395
Interesting theory.

860
00:37:26,397 --> 00:37:29,198
We know it's going to be a hard conspiracy for us to prove.

861
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,233
We got to be careful-- it's not our case.

862
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:37,923
There's a way.

863
00:37:41,294 --> 00:37:43,078
Find the weak link.

864
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,093
Hey, Kaiser.

865
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:01,230
You got a minute?

866
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:03,983
Detective Dockry.

867
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:06,602
I thought we were done.

868
00:38:06,604 --> 00:38:09,488
Look, I told you everything I know about Sullivan.

869
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,073
Yeah, well, something's come up.

870
00:38:11,075 --> 00:38:13,292
Let's go to the station. We can talk about it.

871
00:38:13,294 --> 00:38:15,777
Nah, I'm not going anywhere.

872
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:17,779
Look, I had nothing to do with Sullivan's murder.

873
00:38:17,781 --> 00:38:19,781
I was in New York, man. You checked it out.

874
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:23,636
You really want to do this in front of your friends?

875
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:27,473
I'm not going anywhere with you.

876
00:38:29,593 --> 00:38:32,794
We know about your buddy, Sergeant Dunne,

877
00:38:32,796 --> 00:38:35,648
and his girlfriend.

878
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:41,803
So let me explain how this works.

879
00:38:41,805 --> 00:38:46,408
First suspect to flip on the others gets the deal.

880
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:29,201
Olivia Chandler?

881
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,771
Hey, Gibbs.

882
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:07,406
DiNozzo told me that if you weren't at home

883
00:40:07,408 --> 00:40:09,725
I would probably find you here.

884
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:12,578
Have a seat.

885
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:18,667
There a problem?

886
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:20,286
No, I...

887
00:40:20,288 --> 00:40:22,037
just heard that Falls Church PD

888
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:24,790
arrested my former client, Sergeant Dunne.

889
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:26,125
Really?

890
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:27,843
Yeah, they booked him on multiple charges,

891
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:31,597
including conspiracy to commit murder and murder one.

892
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,881
How'd they get him?

893
00:40:32,883 --> 00:40:35,501
Apparently one of his coconspirators

894
00:40:35,503 --> 00:40:37,252
turned state's evidence.

895
00:40:37,254 --> 00:40:41,440
Sometimes... you get lucky.

896
00:40:41,442 --> 00:40:44,026
Mmm, is that what it was?

897
00:40:45,745 --> 00:40:49,198
They got a warrant and cinched the case against Dunne

898
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,099
when they found the murder weapon, a knife,

899
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:54,119
in his bathroom toilet tank.

900
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:56,422
That's great.

901
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,744
You okay?

902
00:41:01,746 --> 00:41:04,580
Yeah.

903
00:41:04,582 --> 00:41:06,281
Why wouldn't I be? I did my job.

904
00:41:06,283 --> 00:41:07,966
I got Dunne off on the hit-and-run.

905
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:09,385
Yeah, you did it well.

906
00:41:09,387 --> 00:41:11,720
Yes, and whatever happened to him after that,

907
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:12,588
it's not my concern.

908
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:15,624
Justice was served, all around.

909
00:41:18,445 --> 00:41:21,013
Okay. Here you go.

910
00:41:21,015 --> 00:41:23,065
Care to join me for dinner?

911
00:41:23,067 --> 00:41:27,736
Hmm, meat loaf and mashed potatoes?

912
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:32,358
My favorite. I would be happy to.

913
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,910
Coming right up.

914
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:36,662
Thanks, Elaine.

915
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:44,169
I think that you and me have a few things in common.

916
00:41:52,662 --> 00:41:57,662
