1
00:00:06,703 --> 00:00:10,373
现在我们记起你了 我们需要你回来
We remember you now. And we need you back.

2
00:00:10,407 --> 00:00:14,711
所以 亲爱的孙女
So please, my darling granddaughter,

3
00:00:15,745 --> 00:00:18,881
请你告诉我们 你在哪
just tell us, where are you?

4
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,765
塔米辛 你在干什么?
Tamsin, what are you doing?

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,370
- 我们终有一天会死去 - 停车
- We all gotta die some day. - Stop the car.

6
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:44,806
塔米辛
Tamsin!

7
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,808
不
Noooo!

8
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,260
有人在那 快出来
Someone's in there. Come on out.

9
00:01:06,294 --> 00:01:09,196
我不会伤害你的
I'm not gonna hurt you.

10
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:18,005
我还是不会伤害你... 很重的哦
I'm still not gonna hurt you... much.

11
00:01:20,976 --> 00:01:23,009
放轻松 放轻松
Take it easy, take it easy.

12
00:01:23,043 --> 00:01:26,446
嘿 我不会伤害你的
Hey, I'm not gonna hurt you.

13
00:01:29,116 --> 00:01:32,285
当你不知你是谁时 生活会很艰辛
Life is hard when you don't know who you are.

14
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,021
当你知道真相后 生活会更艰难
It's harder when you don't know what you are.

15
00:01:35,055 --> 00:01:37,691
我的爱伴随死神的降临
My love carries a death sentence.

16
00:01:37,725 --> 00:01:42,328
我迷失了多年 在藏匿中找寻
I was lost for years, searching while hiding.

17
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:47,166
那个不为人知的属于我的世界
only to find that I belong to a world hidden from humans.

18
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:48,901
但我已厌倦躲藏 
I won't hide anymore.

19
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:51,837
我要过自己想要的生活
I will live the life I choose.

20
00:01:53,278 --> 00:01:55,979
第四季 第二集 睡美人学院
4x02 - Sleeping Beauty School

21
00:01:57,844 --> 00:02:00,212
你有香槟 巧克力
You got champagne, chocolate.

22
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:04,216
又丝滑又实在的巧克力
both lube and actual chocolate.

23
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,521
而我从维多利亚的秘密超模那得了真传
And I got a lead on some Victoria Secret models.

24
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:12,137
亲爱的 我不是在说什么画册
And I'm not talking catalogue, hon.

25
00:02:12,138 --> 00:02:14,526
我说的是走秀台
I'm talkin' runway.

26
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,496
天使级别质量
Angel quality.

27
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,366
肯吉 你在干什么?
Kenz, what are you doing?

28
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:25,437
看啊! 我准备了她最喜欢的东西
Ta da! I got her favourite stuff.

29
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:28,907
有丝袍 眼罩还有 玉米热狗
I got silk rope, blindfolds, corndogs.

30
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,608
我们还没有找到她
We haven't found her yet.

31
00:02:30,643 --> 00:02:34,311
这不过是时间问题 你懂的
Well, just a matter of time. You know that.

32
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:36,447
塔夫特那里情况如何?
What about Taft's observatory?

33
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:39,383
没有结果 没有发现什么痕迹 它完全消散了
There's nothin', no scent. It's completely gone.

34
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:40,451
特里克还有黑尔呢?
Trick, Hale?

35
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:42,453
黑尔在摆弄她的塔罗牌和电话
Hale is monitoring her cards and phone,

36
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:44,572
特里克在地下安装了试探器 
Trick's got feelers in the underground, 

37
00:02:44,573 --> 00:02:45,856
但是还是没有找到
but so far nothing.

38
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,825
她不可能直接消失不见是吧?
Well it's not like she just disappeared into nothing, right?

39
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,796
不管哪个怂人掳走了她 我肯定
I'm sure she's just super pumped from super-sucking

40
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,766
她现在超级抑郁痛苦
to death whatever ass-fart took her.

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,168
你有可能是对的
You're probably right.

42
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:58,869
当然
Course I am.

43
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:02,305
必须的
Course I am.

44
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:08,511
D 请告诉我有条线索了
D, please tell me we have a lead.

45
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:10,380
你怎么不下楼看看
Why don't you come downstairs.

46
00:03:12,784 --> 00:03:17,220
我的老天 那简直是小版的我 那是谁?
Oh my god it's mini-me. Who is that?

47
00:03:17,254 --> 00:03:18,621
我在那找到她
I found her at the site.

48
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:20,620
你觉得她看到了那场车祸? 
You think she saw the crash? 

49
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,192
我想她就置身于车祸中
I think she was in the crash.

50
00:03:22,226 --> 00:03:26,564
- 你一定在骗我 - 瓦科基里有很多条命
- You've gotta be shitting me. - Valkyries have many lives.

51
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,701
我想她更像是克隆出来的
I just figured she'd be more like clone-y.

52
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:33,769
塔米辛是最后一个看到波的人
Tamsin was the last person to see Bo.

53
00:03:33,804 --> 00:03:36,505
在卡车里 她说了一些关于波父亲的话
And in the truck, she said something about Bo's father.

54
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,608
波甚至不知道关于她父亲的一切
Bo doesn't even know anything about Bo's father.

55
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:40,275
不过有可能她知道
Well maybe she does.

56
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,578
所以我们得审问她
Then we got to go all interrogation on her.

57
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:44,113
看看她到底是谁
Find out who she is for real.

58
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:46,482
我们不想吓到她 她有可能会抓狂
We don't want to frighten her. She might lash out.

59
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:49,051
如果她是塔米辛 她会杀死你
And if she is Tamsin, she tried to kill you.

60
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:50,486
- 就像那样 - 是的
- There is that. - Yeah.

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,287
不过她有可能不是塔米辛
But she might not be Tamsin.

62
00:03:52,322 --> 00:03:55,190
闪开 废柴 我要去玩了
Peace out, losers. I'ma go play.

63
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,361
待会见
Later.

64
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:03,198
- 那是塔米辛 - 塔米辛
- It's Tamsin. - Tamsin!

65
00:04:15,577 --> 00:04:17,712
该死
Oh, dammit.

66
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,485
- 你没事吗? - 没事
- You okay? - Yeah.

67
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,657
- 你需要什么吗? - 谢了 我不用
- If you ever need anything. - Thanks. I don't.

68
00:04:35,597 --> 00:04:38,166
所以她不可能给我们任何信息
So she can't give us any information.

69
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,004
科基里如果复生
When Valkyries are reborn,

70
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:41,468
他们的记忆恢复得慢而且散乱
their memories come back slow and scattered.

71
00:04:41,502 --> 00:04:44,071
而且很显然她们的头发茂密而有光泽
And apparently their hair full and lustrous.

72
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:47,107
在这个时候 他们脆弱又有价值
At this age, they're vulnerable and valuable.

73
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:49,442
但是他们的记忆 会慢慢恢复的 对吗?
But her memories, they will come back eventually right?

74
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:51,679
瓦科基里和死人的灵魂打交道
Valkyries deal in the souls of the dead.

75
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:53,747
他们在人的一生里看到如此多屠杀
They see so much carnage in one lifetime

76
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:57,917
所以她们有时会抑制下一个肉身的记忆
that sometimes they repress those memories in the next.

77
00:04:57,951 --> 00:04:59,052
靠
Shit.

78
00:04:59,086 --> 00:05:02,055
- 注意说话 - 又来了
- Language. - Again.

79
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:06,226
是的 但是太慢了 她是最后一个看见波的人
But yes, c'est tres poopy, she was the last one who saw Bo.

80
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:09,229
这个地方是个死亡圈套
This place is a death trap.

81
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:11,665
让我把这句绣在枕头上
Remind me to embroider that on a pillow.

82
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:12,832
又来了
Again.

83
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:15,234
我看鸭池都比这安全
I've seen duck ponds with better security.

84
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:17,303
你怎么还活着
How are you still alive?

85
00:05:20,574 --> 00:05:24,210
特里克 塔米辛是我们找到波的最后希望吗?
Trick, is Tamsin really our last chance of finding Bo?

86
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:25,845
还有其他的办法
There is one other way.

87
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,980
你的手臂怎么了?
What happened to your arm?

88
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:32,017
我们需要导航仪器
We need a certain directional device.

89
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:35,020
你落在英格拉姆的指南针
The compass you left behind at Engelram's.

90
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:38,190
哦 这个家伙?
Oh, this bad boy?

91
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:44,363
- 你个小偷 - 又来了
- You little thief. - Again.

92
00:05:44,397 --> 00:05:46,264
你有没有看到我的浑天仪
Have either of you seen my Armillary Sphere?

93
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:48,266
好了 你们去忙活的时候
Okay. Well, while you guys are working on that,

94
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,136
我打算做点什么事
I'm gonna go do a couple things.

95
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:55,073
你哪都不能去
You are not going anywhere.

96
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:58,043
- 她不需要照顾 - 又来了
- This does not babysit. - Again.

97
00:05:58,077 --> 00:05:59,044
你玩我吧
Could have fooled me.

98
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:02,080
这是糖衣炮弹吧 不可错过哦
It's about yay big, encrusted in rubies? Hard to miss.

99
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:05,850
我不过是用网游来教育孩子
Okay. I'm just really educating the child in the ways of internet hilarity

100
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:08,453
看一个动物熊跳江南Style
watching an animated bear dance to "Gangnum Style"

101
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:10,054
不过是生活的基本需求 
is a basic life necessity. Well...

102
00:06:10,088 --> 00:06:13,358
你还是可以继续教育她所谓的基本需求
Well you can continue educating her in the basic necessities

103
00:06:13,392 --> 00:06:15,860
还有保证她安全 黑尔和我会去找波
and keep her safe. Hale and I will find Bo.

104
00:06:15,894 --> 00:06:16,861
不要啊
Hells no.

105
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:19,596
- 注意用词 - 又来了
- Language. - Again.

106
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:24,568
- 戴森 - 肯吉 这没有商量的余地
- Dyson. - Kenzi. This is not a discussion.

107
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:26,703
- 你得放我走 - 肯吉 不许走
- You have to let me go! - Kenzi, you're not going.

108
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:30,174
- 又来了 又来了 又来了 - 安静
- Again, again, again, again! - Quiet!

109
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:35,146
- 你知道波在哪? - 我知道她不在哪
- Do you know where Bo is? - I know where she's not.

110
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,316
根据这个罗盘 她不在这个物质地球上了
Because according to this compass she's no longer on this physical plane.

111
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:42,118
又来了
Again.

112
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:52,762
有人吗?
Hello?

113
00:06:56,835 --> 00:06:59,502
怎么周围天旋地转的
Oh, everything's spinning.

114
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:04,686
不是旋转 是在动
Not spinning, moving. Wha...

115
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,010
动?
Moving?

116
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:17,486
靠
Shit.

117
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,960
特里克 你要告诉我们到底发生了什么吗?
Trick, are you gonna tell me what really happened?

118
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,862
我可以闻到阿尔菲的血在你身上
I can smell Aife's blood on you.

119
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:38,132
她被我伤到了
She was wounded... at my hand.

120
00:07:39,802 --> 00:07:43,870
当符咒破解的时候我们想起了波那是好事
When the spell was broken and we remembered Bo, there was joy.

121
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:45,239
但是对于阿尔菲 
But for Aife, 

122
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,408
她能想起来的就是失去了孩子
there was only the memory of losing her child,

123
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:50,043
现在她快要被逼疯了
and she was driven back to insanity.

124
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,314
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,517
波永远都不能知道
Bo must never find out.

126
00:07:56,551 --> 00:07:59,620
很多东西她都不会知道
There's a lot of things Bo must never find out.

127
00:07:59,654 --> 00:08:02,623
所以 追踪者希留斯退休了
So, trackers. Helios is retired.

128
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:04,862
摩的瓦正在监狱 只有艾比斯利 
Moldavia's in prison. There's Ebisu, 

129
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,892
不过他是个傻瓜
but he's an idiot.

130
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:09,596
不 那还有一个人
No. There's only one person who can

131
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:14,400
他可以横贯存在的相交平面
transverse the intersecting planes of existence.

132
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:17,437
恩底弥翁 他可是个传说
Endymion? He's legendary.

133
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:21,174
而且失踪了八百年
And, for the last 800 years, elusive.

134
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,377
只有一个人能告诉我们他在哪
There's only one Fae who might be able to tell us where he is.

135
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:26,346
莎琳娜
Selene.

136
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,282
他的前妻 开了一家美术馆
His ex. She owns a salon.

137
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:35,320
尤那达人
The Una Mens.

138
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:38,190
他们不是在阿什那里嘛
I thought they set up base in the Ash's compound.

139
00:08:38,224 --> 00:08:40,660
他们在审问人
They're pulling in people for "interviews."

140
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,795
重建规则是一个庞大的活
Restoring order is a messy business.

141
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:46,134
折磨 死亡 狩猎 痛苦 之类的
Torture, death, man-hunts, pain. The usze.

142
00:09:04,984 --> 00:09:07,118
这是痛苦的样子?
Is this what pain looks like?

143
00:09:07,153 --> 00:09:10,354
不 这是在圣卢西亚做水疗
No, this is a spa weekend in St. Lucia.

144
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:12,123
拜托 不要
Please. No more.

145
00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:15,226
告诉我们你对莫里根的尸体做了什么
Tell us what you have done with The Morrigan's body.

146
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,963
她躲在我书桌上的油画后
She was behind the portrait above my desk.

147
00:09:18,998 --> 00:09:23,634
但是她跑掉了 那个讨厌的村姑在嘲笑我
But she escaped. That wicked wench is toying with me.

148
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:26,170
她没有死 她只是失踪了
She's not dead. She's missing.

149
00:09:26,205 --> 00:09:29,340
她没有死 失踪而已
She is dead. She is missing.

150
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:32,009
你说的中间必有一个谎言 或者都是
One of those things is a lie. Or both.

151
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:36,146
那个小妓女还好好活着
That evil little tart is very irritatingly alive.

152
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:38,849
我用祖先的名义发誓
I swear on the graves of my family.

153
00:09:38,883 --> 00:09:41,919
我们该把你送去见你祖宗
It was our mistake to not count you amongst those graves.

154
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:45,089
生命给予幻术师太大的力量
This life gives too much power to the last Mesmer.

155
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:46,824
而你不过白白浪费
You are but waste.

156
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:51,161
不要 不要
Please, please no!

157
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:55,299
不 别 不 等一下
No, please, please! No, no wait!

158
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:59,802
- 我会给你想要的 - 感兴趣
- I'll give you what you want. - Interested.

159
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:02,639
- 不是艾芙妮 - 不感兴趣
- Not Evony. - Not interested.

160
00:10:02,673 --> 00:10:06,576
一些极其更有价值的
Something infinitely more valuable.

161
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:10,947
为什么我要给你的疯女人
Why would I give you a crazy bitch,

162
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:12,648
既然我可以给你她
when I could give you her.

163
00:10:18,989 --> 00:10:22,291
接受 你被释放了
Accepted. You are released.

164
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:24,894
做一个小调整
With one minor adjustment.

165
00:10:43,412 --> 00:10:46,648
欢迎来到莎琳娜家 男士们 我能帮你什么
Welcome to Selene's, gentlemen. What can I help you with?

166
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:49,084
涂指甲? 刮胸毛?
Mani-pedi? Chest wax?

167
00:10:49,118 --> 00:10:52,020
- 擦亮你的徽章? - 我们在找人
- Polish your badges? - We're looking for someone.

168
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:54,168
我们都一样啊 亲爱的 
Aren't we all, darling. 

169
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:55,957
旧事重提 恩底弥翁
A blast from the past. Endymion.

170
00:10:55,992 --> 00:11:00,027
艾迪 我的罗德・斯图尔特 好几年了
Eddy? Oh my Rod Stewart, it's been years.

171
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:02,430
你是知道他在哪 我们需要立刻找到他
Of you know where he is, we need to find him immediately.

172
00:11:02,464 --> 00:11:04,532
先娱乐后工作
Pleasure before business.

173
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:07,495
有人告诉我你们这些不守规矩的
Something tells me those unruly curls 

174
00:11:07,496 --> 00:11:09,170
卷毛控制不住自己
aren't going to manage themselves.

175
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:24,952
我们通常不让顾客自己预约
We don't usually let customers make their own appointments.

176
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:26,053
事实上我是...
Actually I was just...

177
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:28,923
你是来找 艾迪 你想从他身上得到什么
You were looking for Eddy. What do you want with him?

178
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:30,590
这是警察的事
It's police business.

179
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:34,260
你知道莎琳娜准备把你们排成一排踹走
You know, Selene's gonna string you along for a kick,

180
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:36,330
但是她不会告诉你
but she's not gonna tell you shit.

181
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:40,168
所以你要做的就是去见爱思特德
So what you need to do is go and see Astrid.

182
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:46,142
你需要见她给她个信息
And you need to go and give her this message.

183
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,347
这是印度语
This is Hindi.

184
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:58,485
等等 我还不知道你的...名字
Wait, look, you know I didn't get your... name.

185
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,229
你找到了什么吗? 
Did you get anything? 

186
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,897
别担心 我有线索了
Yeah don't worry, I got a lead.

187
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,132
不错 我有满脑子信息
Good, all I got was a head massage.

188
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:21,974
- 戴森是你的男友吗 - 不是
- Is Dyson your boyfriend? - Nyet.

189
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:25,844
- 你有男友吗? - 没有 男人都蠢
- Do you have a boyfriend? - Negative. Men are stupid.

190
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,346
你曾经有男友吗
Did you ever have a boyfriend?

191
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,882
用这个身体? 见鬼
With this bod? Hel... heck yeah.

192
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,118
- 你为什么分手了? - 很复杂
- Why'd you break up? - It's complicated.

193
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,552
你还爱他吗?
Didn't you love him anymore?

194
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,089
我知道了 你认为爱就是最根本的
I know, right? You think that love's going to be the ultimate,

195
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:40,859
然后你认为要放弃所有的
then you realize that it means giving up more than you knew.

196
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,895
你做了个决定 它把你困在了恼人的盒子
You make a decision and it kicks you in the freakin' box

197
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,632
然后让你想这如果还值得去爱
and leaves you wondering if it's ever worth loving again!

198
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,067
无所谓了
Or whatever.

199
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,637
谁是黑尔? 可爱吗
Who's Hale? Is he cute?

200
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,940
他是一个朋友 一个警察 警察朋友
He's a friend. A cop. A cop friend.

201
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:58,142
避孕套是什么?
What's a condom?

202
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:01,913
好吧 不不 你得...
Okay, no, no, no, no, no. You gotta...

203

Hey!

204
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:08,552
尖锐的东西 不能碰
Hey hey hey, sharp objects! Not for you.

205
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:12,556
这是波的房间 只能她进
Look, this is Bo's room. Bo only.

206
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,491
我不想你动她的东西
I don't want you touching her stuff.

207
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:18,896
我甚至不想你看她的东西
I don't even want you looking at her stuff, okay?

208
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,063
你在干什么
What are you doing?

209
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:22,365
为什么你在晃 是因为瓦科基里的事吗
Why are you vibrating? Is it a Valkyrie thing?

210
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,601
我得去尿尿
I have to pee.

211
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:28,805
哦 我不需要跟你去 是吧
Oh, I don't need to, like, be there for that, do I?

212
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,009
- 不 - 好吧 去吧

I need that to be Fae.! It's my only hope!

216
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:58,400
塔米 对不起 别哭
Oh Tam-Tam honey. Honey, I'm sorry. Please don't cry.

217
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:00,302
别哭了 都是我的错
Please don't cry. It's all my fault.

218
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:04,807
愚蠢的肯吉 那面霜是我的伪装
Stupid Kenzi. It's just that the cream, it's my disguise.

219
00:14:05,842 --> 00:14:09,011
是魔法 你想看吗
It's magic, it's magic. Do you want to see it?

220
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:12,848
好 看这
Okay, okay. Here.

221
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:17,552

Okay.

222
00:14:17,587 --> 00:14:21,255
小女孩和瓦科基里
Little girls and Valkyries,

223
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,662
我现在展示的是肯吉娜拉的俄罗斯魔法
I present to you the Russian magic of Kenzlana.

224
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:40,674
再来一次
Again.

225
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:43,511
对不起 我做不成 没有面霜 没有闪光
Sorry kid, can't do it. No cream, no gleam.

226
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:48,483
但是我们能做饼干
But um, we can make cookies.

227
00:14:49,818 --> 00:14:51,719
不 这我没法做
No. This I cannot do.

228
00:14:51,753 --> 00:14:54,522
写这个的女人不想让你们找到他
The woman who wrote that doesn't want you to find him.

229
00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:56,857
她希望你的记忆抹去
She wants your memories erased.

230
00:14:56,892 --> 00:14:59,727
还有很多消息
Well there's a lot of that goin' around.

231
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:04,832
金发的很沮丧 另一个也是
The blonde one is frustrated. The other one too.

232
00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:08,768
你去找一个猎人 需要勇气去捕猎
You seek a hunter. And you seek the courage to hunt.

233
00:15:10,238 --> 00:15:12,005
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

234
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,874
我没有说话 我不能说话
I don't talk. I cannot talk.

235
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,982
阿斯顿米 很荣幸
An Astomi. It's a pleasure.

236
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:25,251
我也是 你们两个很符合
Mine too. For one who gets her sustenance

237
00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:29,756
她的食物的口味 你们两个是可口的美味
from the scents around her, you two are a tasty treat.

238
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,858
为什么你不抹去你的记忆
Why didn't you erase our memories?

239
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:34,076
我已经香化面霜和洗发水
I've been perfuming creams and shampoos 

240
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:36,062
在莎琳娜那里好几年了
at Selene's for years.

241
00:15:36,096 --> 00:15:38,932
在那工作的女人是恶魔的化身
The women who work there are evil incarnate.

242
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:43,269
12年以后我的烫发还没有出来
12 years later, and my perm still hasn't grown out.

243
00:15:43,303 --> 00:15:47,806
- 你会帮我们吗 - 这是我的荣幸
- Will you help us? - It would be my pleasure.

244
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,145
这是一支吻 只有一个时候可以用到
This is one kiss. Only one moment will be its match.

245
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,582
- 对不起 - 你会得到你想要的
- Excuse me? - You will get what you need.

246
00:16:01,353 --> 00:16:05,410
至于你的失意 去找你爱的人
And for your frustrations. Go to the one you love.

247
00:16:17,136 --> 00:16:21,272
我已经幻想过无数次这样的场景了
I've had several fantasies that started just like this.

248
00:16:24,743 --> 00:16:27,345
你真不应该回来
You really shouldn't have come back.

249
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:29,146
你对我说谎
You lied to me.

250
00:16:30,415 --> 00:16:32,382
我认为是你回答问题的时候了
I think it's time you answered some questions.

251
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:36,053
女孩们 吃饭时间到了
Girls, it's feeding time.

252
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:38,432
猜下谁会来吃晚餐
And guess who's coming to dinner?

253
00:16:41,392 --> 00:16:42,392
喔
Whoa.

254
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:45,929
这就是你的幻想 所有女孩拿着棍子样的东西
So this fantasy of yours, all the girls carrying pokey things?

255
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,168
不 唯一棍子的东西 就是我的
Nope. There was only one pokey thing. And it was mine.

256
00:16:58,162 --> 00:17:01,832
- 你叫什么 - 谁管呢 他就像美味零食
- What's your name? - Who cares. He's snackilicious.

257
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:03,454
他闻起来就是纸杯蛋糕...
He smells like cupcakes... 

258
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,301
和新洗的衣裳
And fresh laundry...

259
00:17:04,336 --> 00:17:05,969
那个强・汉姆
And Jon Hamm.

260
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:07,992
爱思特德对我们做了什么 
What did Astrid do to us? 

261
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,272
不是我们 是你
Not us. You.

262
00:17:09,307 --> 00:17:12,375
我饿了
I'm hungry.

263
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:13,443
黑尔 我得走了...
Hale, I, I gotta...

264
00:17:13,477 --> 00:17:16,646
你去找莎琳娜 艾迪 做你该做的
Yeah, go find Selene, find Eddy. Do what you gotta do.

265
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,181
我欠你一个人情
I owe you one.

266
00:17:18,216 --> 00:17:19,782
对你欠我50个
Yeah, you owe me like 50.

267
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:23,388
所以你和波一起住 那意味着你们爱对方吗
So if you and Bo live together, does that mean you love each other?

268
00:17:25,422 --> 00:17:27,957
当然 那是完全的永远的好朋友
Totally. But it's strictly BFF's.

269
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:31,231
- 想舔一下吗 - 什么是最好的朋友
- Here, wanna lick? - What's BFF?

270
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:35,931
就像两个人在一起会为对方做任何事
Well. It's when 2 people would do anything for each other

271
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:37,700
总会得到另一方的回报
and have always got each other's backs.

272
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:40,132
就像 如果有一个人有麻烦了 
Like, if one's in trouble, 

273
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:41,503
另一个会解决它们
the other gets them out.

274
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:44,173
如过有一方难过了 另一方会化上闪耀的眼妆
If one's sad, the other puts on sparkly eye make-up

275
00:17:44,207 --> 00:17:46,909
带他们出去跳舞
and takes them out dancing.

276
00:17:46,943 --> 00:17:51,446
如果一个不见了 另一人用最小的暗示
If one's missing, the other has even the tiniest inkling

277
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:52,848
就知道他们在哪
of where the they are.

278
00:17:52,883 --> 00:17:57,519
但是波不见了 你不知道她在哪
But Bo's missing and you don't know where she is.

279
00:17:57,553 --> 00:17:59,388
我知道 讨厌
I know. I suck.

280
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:05,026
喔!

281
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,729
塔米辛 我不是告诉你别动任何东西
Tamsin, I told you not to... touch anything!

282
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:13,067
妈的 这是波吗
Holy dildos! Is that Bo?

283
00:18:13,102 --> 00:18:17,171
- 哦 好吧 - 着着火呢
- Ow, ow, ow. Okay. - It's burning, it's burning!

284
00:18:17,206 --> 00:18:20,674
- 没用的废话 - 这变糟糕了 变糟糕了
- Oh crapity crap. - It's getting worse. It's getting worse!

285
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:22,476
好吧 详情报道 我知道了
Okay, Play-by-play, I get it.

286
00:18:28,784 --> 00:18:33,053
M M X V 这意味这什么
M M X V. What does that mean?

287
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,670
我不知道 也许一些疯狂的预言字母 
I dunno, probably some crazy Fae word. 

288
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,725
D会知道的
D-Man will know.

289
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,562
你认为波被困在卡里了吗
Do you think Bo's stuck in the card?

290
00:18:47,302 --> 00:18:49,436
精细
Subtle.

291
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,847
我在巴黎时候很久就没看见过了
I haven't seen one of these since my time in France.

292
00:19:00,881 --> 00:19:04,717
如果记忆管用的话 也需要很多的手感
If memory serves, it takes a great deal of finesse

293
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:07,386
去解开1879年的约瑟夫・劳克
to unlock a 1879 Joseph Loch.

294
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,967
艾迪
Eddy.

295
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:24,937
艾迪
Eddy!

296
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:28,374
艾迪你最好没死
Eddy! You better not be dead.

297
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:34,081
没有死 亲爱的 就是沉沉的睡着了
Not dead, darling. Just fast, fast asleep.

298
00:19:40,453 --> 00:19:41,753
波
Bo?!

299
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:45,223
不是波
Not Bo.

300
00:19:47,527 --> 00:19:51,229
笨手笨脚的人 你认为你来这干什么
Hey butterfingers, what do you think you're doing over here?

301
00:19:51,263 --> 00:19:52,397
重新装修
Redecorating?

302
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:55,500
下一次在桌子上放花或者其他的
Well next time, put flowers on the table or something.

303
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:57,469
我不知道发生什么了 我就是...
I don't know what happened. I just ...

304
00:19:57,503 --> 00:19:59,604
就是说你从来没有在你生命中
What happened is you've never waited a table

305
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:03,941
当过服务员... 不管你简历上这么说
a day in your life... Despite what your resume says.

306
00:20:03,976 --> 00:20:07,980
我认为...我丢了我的胸牌
I think I... I think I lost my name tag.

307
00:20:09,014 --> 00:20:13,619
没事 我们都在逃离一些事 安柏
It's okay. We're all running from something, "Amber."

308
00:20:16,187 --> 00:20:18,188
我总是制造麻烦
I always make such a mess.

309
00:20:18,223 --> 00:20:21,492
你就是那种笨手笨脚的人
You are kind of a huge klutz.

310
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:25,496
但是你很可爱 有趣
But you're also cute, and funny.

311
00:20:27,032 --> 00:20:30,167
而且性感
And... sexy.

312
00:20:32,203 --> 00:20:34,371
你认为我很有趣?
You think I'm funny?

313
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:38,442
我认为你需要喝一杯 今晚打烊后
I think you need a drink. Tonight, after closing.

314
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:43,013
我不能 对不起 我就是不能
I can't. I'm sorry, I just can't.

315
00:20:47,718 --> 00:20:50,720
他真是漂亮
He's just so beautiful.

316
00:20:50,755 --> 00:20:54,157
艾迪 醒醒 醒醒
Eddy, wake up man. Wake up.

317
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:56,292
只有我能做到 亲爱的
Only I can do that, sweetheart

318
00:20:56,326 --> 00:20:59,195
但是我不会为你这么做 
and I'm not about to do it for you.

319
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:05,668
- 你会叫醒他的 - 如果不呢?
- You will wake him. - Or...?

320
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:09,172
我会把你用牙撕成碎片
I'll tear you to pieces with my teeth.

321
00:21:09,206 --> 00:21:12,241
保证会先打我屁屁?
Promise to spank me first?

322
00:21:12,276 --> 00:21:14,677
如果必须的话
If that's what it takes.

323
00:21:14,711 --> 00:21:18,881
两个字 偏不
Two words. Nuh-uh.

324
00:21:18,915 --> 00:21:19,882
叫醒他
Wake him!

325
00:21:21,484 --> 00:21:23,886
忘了艾迪吧 他出局了
Forget Eddy. He's out.

326
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,354
狼人来了
The wolf is in.

327
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:30,395
至少他将会的 只要一个吻就可以办到
Or at least he will be. And all it will take is just one kiss.

328
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:38,266
一个吻 我就是你的囚徒?
One kiss and I end up your prisoner?

329
00:21:38,301 --> 00:21:40,235
只有在你睡着的时候
Only when you're asleep.

330
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:44,640
再多一个 我就任你处罚
Then one kiss more and I'm all yours to punish.

331
00:21:45,674 --> 00:21:48,843
知道这些就够了
That's all I needed to hear.

332
00:21:59,421 --> 00:22:03,324
现在吻他
Now kiss... him.

333
00:22:16,138 --> 00:22:19,240
- 发生了什么事? - 艾迪?
- What's happening? - Eddy?

334
00:22:19,274 --> 00:22:21,008
海洛特
Harlot.

335
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:23,644
艾迪 我需要你的帮助
Eddy, I need your help.

336
00:22:23,678 --> 00:22:28,148
当然 但是先帮我绑住这个妓女
Of course. But first, help me bind this trollop.

337
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:31,684
然后我们可以谈谈我欠你多少 好心人
Then we can talk of the great debt I owe you, kind sir.

338
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,391
蜂蜜酒 我请客 或者土耳其浴
Perhaps mead, on me. Or a Turkish bath.

339
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:40,760
我需要你帮我找到我爱的女人
I need you to help me find the woman I love.

340
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:44,163
这么重要的人 她叫什么
And what is the name of this magnificent creature?

341
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,564
波
Bo.

342
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:48,534
你是对的 肯吉
You're right, Kenz,

343
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:51,137
开锁是每个女人的必备技能
lock-picking is skill every woman should know.

344
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:57,109
肯吉? 我知道这个名字 它是…
Kenz? I know that name. It's...

345
00:22:57,144 --> 00:22:59,678
哦 不
Oh no.

346
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:05,116
嗨 外面有人吗
Hey! Is anybody out there?

347
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,628
- 终于 - 嘘 你会吵醒了他
- Oh! Finally. - Shhhh. You'll awaken Him.

348
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:19,164
他?
Him?

349
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,299
我不能说
I don't think I can say.

350
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:36,647
漂亮的眼睛 棕色和蓝色
Beautiful eyes. Both brown and blue.

351
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:38,816
你就是那一个
You are the one.

352
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,019
这是哪儿? 他是谁?
What is this place? Who is "He?"

353
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:47,257
你惹他生气了
You made him angry.

354
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:50,005
这都是你的错
This is all your fault!

355
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,602
她大概五英尺六英寸 棕色眼睛 
She's about 5'6, brown eyes, 

356
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:57,948
白人 长棕色头发
Caucasian. Long brown hair...

357
00:23:57,982 --> 00:23:59,832
先生 这仅是波的描述 
Sir, this is merely a description of Bo. 

358
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,019
我需要你告诉我关于她的事情
I need you to tell me about Bo.

359
00:24:02,053 --> 00:24:03,220
好 她是嫌犯吗?
Right, is she a suspect?

360
00:24:03,254 --> 00:24:04,706
你的意思是我们要谈论 
You mean like, "She dances like no one's watching" 

361
00:24:04,707 --> 00:24:06,290
"她跳起舞来旁若无人"?
are we talkin' about?

362
00:24:06,324 --> 00:24:09,259
不 我需要知道你的心在哪里 和她的心
No, I need to know where your heart lies, and hers as well.

363
00:24:09,294 --> 00:24:11,561
- 她的心是她自己的 - 不完全是你的?
- Her heart is her own. - Not entirely yours?

364
00:24:11,595 --> 00:24:16,232
- 她有个女朋友 - 啊 背叛了你的婊子
- She has a girlfriend. - Ah, the betrayal of a strumpet.

365
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:18,835
再说一遍我把你的舌头割下来
Say that again and I will rip out your tongue.

366
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:20,403

My apologies.

367
00:24:20,438 --> 00:24:24,307
但是你有她出界的证明吗?
But do you have renderings of these transgressions?

368
00:24:26,644 --> 00:24:30,847
- 看 - 你是从哪里得到这个的?
- Hey. - Where did you get this?

369
00:24:30,881 --> 00:24:34,083
- 肯吉 - 又一个情人
- Kenzi. - Another lover!

370
00:24:34,117 --> 00:24:36,485
- 她是… - 你们是彼此的恋人?
- She's... - You are Kenzi's and Kenzi is yours?

371
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:38,354
不 她是我的
No! She's mine!

372
00:24:38,388 --> 00:24:42,291
我的朋友 只是朋友
Mine friend. My friend.

373
00:24:42,326 --> 00:24:44,961
一个朋友
A friend.

374
00:24:44,995 --> 00:24:48,333
如果波在那张卡上 她就有大麻烦了
If that is your Bo on that card, she's in a heap of trouble.

375
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:54,937
艾迪 你必须帮我
Eddy, you have to help me.

376
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:57,573
抱歉 我不答应
Apologies, but no.

377
00:24:57,607 --> 00:25:01,242
你饿了吗? 我突然很想吃羊肉
Are you hungry? I've a sudden craving for mutton.

378
00:25:03,546 --> 00:25:07,482
她有最美的心灵
She has the most beautiful heart

379
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:10,585
每一次她爱的人受伤她都会心碎
and it breaks every time someone she loves is hurting.

380
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:14,322
她很勇敢 固执 很有激情
She's brave, stubborn, she's passionate...

381
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:17,425

382
00:25:20,162 --> 00:25:23,631
她爱起来倾尽所有
She loves with all of her being.

383
00:25:23,665 --> 00:25:26,133
没了她我什么也做不成
And I can't do any of this without her.

384
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:30,171
- 现在 还那么困难吗? - 不了
- Now, was that so difficult? - No.

385
00:25:31,206 --> 00:25:34,742
你刚刚做的…
Yeah. What you just did, that's...

386
00:25:34,776 --> 00:25:37,011
那么大声说出来 很困难
Sayin' it out loud like that, that's hard.

387
00:25:37,045 --> 00:25:40,780
说出你的心最深切隐秘的欲望
Yes, to delve into the innermost sanctum of the heart's desires

388
00:25:40,815 --> 00:25:44,351
常常被认为是一个人最艰难的旅程
is oft deemed one of life's most arduous journeys.

389
00:25:44,386 --> 00:25:48,588
- 黑尔 你要告诉她 - 谁?
- Hale, you gotta tell her, man. - Who?

390
00:25:48,623 --> 00:25:50,190
别逃避了
Don't do that.

391
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:52,859
肯吉 你要告诉她你的感觉
Kenzi, you gotta tell her how you feel.

392
00:25:52,894 --> 00:25:54,928
- 好吧 那个… - 啊 原来她是你的
- Okay, that... - Ah, so Kenzi is yours.

393
00:25:54,962 --> 00:25:59,766
那不容易 好吗? 只因为你确定
Hey, it's not that easy, all right? Just because you're sure...

394
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,301
波爱的是劳伦 
Bo is in love with Lauren.

395
00:26:02,336 --> 00:26:05,539
但是我仍然为她战斗因为我知道我的感觉
But I still fight for her because I know how I feel.

396
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:07,707
- 是的 你知道 我们要找到波- 不 不
- Yeah, you know, we need to find Bo, so... - No, no...

397
00:26:07,742 --> 00:26:10,109
格鲁达要来了 你的家庭不同意
The Garuda is coming; Your family won't approve;

398
00:26:10,144 --> 00:26:14,847
你太胖了 三年都过去了 黑尔
your pants are too tight. It has been 3 years, Hale.

399
00:26:14,881 --> 00:26:18,751
你爱她 而她就在你眼前
You've been longing for her and she's right in front of you.

400
00:26:24,658 --> 00:26:25,925
好的
Okay.

401
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,759
太好了 我说过 这值得在最难喝的
That was wonderful! I said, it calls for a

402
00:26:32,794 --> 00:26:35,067
酒吧里来一杯庆祝
drink at your most unsavoury watering hole.

403
00:26:35,101 --> 00:26:38,571
- 我们有事要做 - 好吧
- You and I have work to do. - Yes.

404
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,375
- 一份肝和洋葱 - 谢谢 亲爱的
- One liver and onions. - Thank you, darling.

405
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:47,479
别走太远 你很漂亮
Now don't go too far. I do like that view.

406
00:26:49,949 --> 00:26:52,917
我觉得那个男人刚用他的眼神抽了我的屁股
I think that guy just slapped my butt with his eyes.

407
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:55,520
你是怎么忍受这样的顾客的
How do you put up with some of these customers?

408
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:58,072
员工不也忍过来了嘛?
Same as I put up with some of the staff.

409
00:27:00,226 --> 00:27:02,226
对不起 如果之前我很不礼貌但是
I'm sorry if I was rude earlier but...

410
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:06,465
好的道歉不会包含 "如果" 和 "但是"
No good apology ever included the words "if" and "but."

411
00:27:09,902 --> 00:27:12,870
嗯 我是个混蛋 好些没?
Uhm, I'm a jerk. Better?

412
00:27:14,272 --> 00:27:17,908
我是个自我为中心的混蛋?
I'm an egocentric jerk?

413
00:27:17,942 --> 00:27:20,511
别太为难自己 公主
Don't be too hard on yourself, Princess.

414
00:27:20,545 --> 00:27:22,279
也别太为难他们
And don't be hard on them either.

415
00:27:22,314 --> 00:27:25,983
特别是打屁股的事情 我也想做啊
Especially about the butt thing. I'd slap that.

416
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:28,051
你总比那个笨蛋强
Yeah well better you than bonehead ...

417
00:27:28,086 --> 00:27:30,554
- 天哪 他噎住了 - 什么?
- Oh my god, he's choking. - What?

418
00:27:31,189 --> 00:27:32,789
天哪
Oh my god.

419
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,129
帮我放倒他 帮我放倒他
Help me get him down, help me get him down.

420
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:49,840
天哪
Oh my god.

421
00:28:02,486 --> 00:28:05,455
你是加纳多样异种 对吗?
You're a Ghanian Diversity Fae, right?

422
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,471
谢谢 
Thank you. Phew!

423
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:27,876
你知道我们能用这个赚多少吗?
Do you know how much we can make for this?

424
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,679
我录下了整个关于外星人的过程
I've recorded the whole alien thing.

425
00:28:32,182 --> 00:28:33,603
奥托和我是很好的联盟 
Otto and I were great allies, 

426
00:28:33,604 --> 00:28:35,284
但赢了拉克菲尔德战斗的是我
but it was I who won the battle of Lechfield.

427
00:28:35,318 --> 00:28:36,385
那很好 怎么
That's great. How...

428
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:38,853
我怎么做到的? 我转移了他们的注意力
How did I do it? Why, by diverting attention using a

429
00:28:38,888 --> 00:28:40,419
就用了一个涉及到烟雾 
clever technique involving smoke, 

430
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,090
五维位移和一头吵闹的牛的
a total of five dimensional

431
00:28:42,124 --> 00:28:44,859
很聪明的小技术 
shifts and the loud braying of cattle.

432
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:47,361
嗯 所以关于空间位移
Okay, so these dimensional shifts,

433
00:28:47,396 --> 00:28:50,131
我们要在他们之间移动 怎么才能做到呢?
we have to move between them right? How do we do that?

434
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:51,833
这很复杂
It's complicated.

435
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:55,536
我爱的女人在那里 并且还有危险 拜托了
The woman I love is out there, and she's in danger. Please.

436
00:28:55,571 --> 00:29:00,107
如果我找不到你的波我还会有这些吗?
If I couldn't find your Bo, would I have these?

437
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:07,348
我们被跟踪了
We're being followed.

438
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:10,884
戴森 我们需要找到矛盾处
You see, Dyson, we need to find an inconsistency.

439
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,186
一个变换?
A shift?

440
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:15,122
一个在时间和物理上都断断续续的事物
A stutter of either the temporal or physical realms.

441
00:29:15,156 --> 00:29:17,157
艾迪 我觉得我们两者都有
Eddy, I think we have both.

442
00:29:17,192 --> 00:29:19,592
看 同一个男人同时出现在两个地方
Look, the same man appears in two places at once.

443
00:29:19,626 --> 00:29:23,830
- 都超越时间 - 干得好
- Both move out of time. - Good work.

444
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:28,101
学生变成了老师 当然我在开玩笑 
And the student becomes the teacher. I jest of course.

445
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:31,070
当然 那我们怎么办?
Of course. So now what do we do?

446
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:33,106
我们去打个招呼
We go say hello.

447
00:29:35,675 --> 00:29:40,145
肯吉 你是个男人 我是个女人
Kenzi, you're a man, I'm a woman.

448
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:45,218
肯吉 你是个女人 
Kenzi, you're a woman, 

449
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:47,088
我是个男人 所以这说得通
I'm a man, so it only makes sense.

450
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:51,857
喔 这真蠢
Wow, that is stupid.

451
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:55,093
嘘
Shhhh.

452
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:58,496
我用了五首艾薇儿的歌
It took like five Avril Lavigne songs to get Baby Tam-Tam

453
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,366
才让塔米睡着 你打扰到她
a ticket to play-time land. You wake her Sk8er Boi,

454
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,401
你就负责去处理她
you are dealing with her.

455
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:06,304
你知道整整五首艾薇儿的歌词?
You know the words to five Avril Lavigne songs?

456
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:13,203
黑尔…你真好
Hale... That is so sweet.

457
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:19,150
这些能够给波的房间多加点装饰
These are gonna add that little boom-boom-pow Bo's room needs.

458
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:26,323
- 怎么了? - 我要告诉你一些事
- So wassup, Siren? - I need to tell you something.

459
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,260
你们找到艾迪了吗 他是一个跟踪能手?
Did you guys find Eddy? Is he a total tracking genius?

460
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,972
- 算是吧 但是… - 但是什么? 你们
- Kind of. But... - But what? Do you guys

461
00:30:31,015 --> 00:30:33,178
找到关于波的踪迹没有? 
have a lead on Bo or not? 

462
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:35,032
你能不能消停一会儿?
Can you just stand still for a second?

463
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:39,137
你的表情怎么这么扭曲? 波出事了?
Why are you so twitchy? Is it Bo?

464
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:43,674
她变成金色头发了? 啊 我怎么在开玩笑?
Is she blonde? Ugh, why am I joking?

465
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,909
发生了什么? 黑尔 告诉我
What is happening? Hale, talk to me.

466
00:30:45,943 --> 00:30:47,477
我喜欢你
I like you.

467
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,548
每次我一走进房间 就只能看见你
Every time I walk into a room, you are all I can look at.

468
00:30:51,582 --> 00:30:55,321
你有一个人类所少有的风范和力量
You have so much style and strength no human should have.

469
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:01,691
我希望能参与你的生活 
I want to be a part of that. 

470
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:03,794
我也希望成为你的一部分
I want to be a part of you too.

471
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:13,837
- 啊 好诡异 - 好的诡异?
- Ugh, this is weird. - Good weird?

472
00:31:21,978 --> 00:31:26,949
这没关系吧 对吗?
This is all right, right? Right.

473
00:31:33,756 --> 00:31:37,192
- 等等 - 少说话 多做事
- Wait, wait. - Less talking, more everything else.

474
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:39,487
哦天哪 我喜欢你穿紫色 
Oh god, I love you in purple. 

475
00:31:39,488 --> 00:31:41,264
等等 是因为香水吧
Wait, it's the perfume.

476
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:44,632
它闻起来像一段好时光
Oh it smells like a good time to me.

477
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:46,969
它是个咒语
It's a spell.

478
00:31:47,003 --> 00:31:49,337
塔米辛
Tamsin.

479
00:31:50,906 --> 00:31:52,468
天啊 波莎 德杰尼勒斯 
Holy Portia DeGeneres, 

480
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:53,641
夏奇拉 戴维李罗斯
Shakira, David Lee Roth.

481
00:31:53,676 --> 00:31:55,076
我醒来就这样了
I woke up and this happened!

482
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,679
要命啊 我最多醒来长丘疹
Shit, all I've ever woken up with is a zit.

483
00:31:57,713 --> 00:31:59,914
- 我丑爆了 - 你还好啦
- I'm hideous! - Yeah, you're really not.

484
00:31:59,948 --> 00:32:01,649
这是什么突发状况?
Is this some kind of spurt?

485
00:32:01,684 --> 00:32:04,185
你以为我是谁? 瓦科基里的斯波克医生?
Who do I look like? Dr. Spock's Guide to Growing Valkyries?

486
00:32:04,219 --> 00:32:06,187
我哪知道 她要是这进度
Well, I don't know! If she keeps this up,

487
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:08,422
周二就能赶上贝蒂・怀特了
she's gonna be Betty White by Tuesday.

488
00:32:08,456 --> 00:32:10,958
没事的 亲爱的 一切都会好的
Here honey, it's okay. It's gonna be okay.

489
00:32:10,993 --> 00:32:13,060
- 好吧 - 黑尔 跟她说一切都会好
- Okay.  - Hale, tell her everything's gonna be okay!

490
00:32:13,095 --> 00:32:17,198
- 一切都会好的 因为... - 嗯嗯
- Everything's gonna be okay 'cause ... - U-huh...

491
00:32:17,232 --> 00:32:21,735
- 天啊 头发 - 我们身体本来就会成长
- Oh my god, the hair! - ... as we grow our bodies change.

492
00:32:21,736 --> 00:32:24,671
世事无常 大概正常嘛
Stuff happens. Mostly normal.

493
00:32:24,706 --> 00:32:28,642
这还正常? 这也太大了吧
This is normal? But these things are so big.

494
00:32:28,676 --> 00:32:32,270
看起来傻不? 我还能跳绳吗?
Are they stupid? Can I still jump rope?

495
00:32:32,447 --> 00:32:34,415
- 不 - 好了 你还是先走吧
- No... - Oh yeah, maybe you should just go.

496
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:35,449
黑尔 跟我跳起来
Hale, jump with me!

497
00:32:35,483 --> 00:32:36,302
不不不 
No no no. 

498
00:32:36,303 --> 00:32:38,351
坏瓦科基里 我是说 坏黑尔
Bad Valkyrie. I mean, bad Hale.

499
00:32:38,386 --> 00:32:41,054
黑尔要走了 但肯吉 我们可没谈完
Hale has to go now. But Kenzi, we are not done talking.

500
00:32:48,062 --> 00:32:50,663
我感觉超级诡异
I feel super bizzaro.

501
00:32:50,697 --> 00:32:54,600
很抱歉通知你 孩子 这可从不会消失
Well I'm sorry to tell you, kid, but it's never goin' away.

502
00:32:54,635 --> 00:32:57,349
这是成长的必经之路
It's just part of growin' up.

503
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:08,414
"热狗" 我从没吃过这么恶心又
"Smog dog." I've never had anything so equal parts

504
00:33:08,449 --> 00:33:12,552
- 美味的东西 - 艾迪 这是什么?
- disgusting and delicious. - Eddy, what is this?

505
00:33:13,586 --> 00:33:18,057
看起来像自动贩卖机啊
Well it looks like some sort of condiment dispenser?

506
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,460
什么
What?

507
00:33:21,494 --> 00:33:25,464
艾迪 这是异种 我看不懂这方言 不过
Eddy, this is Fae. I can't read the dialect but...

508
00:33:25,498 --> 00:33:27,432
你在莎琳娜睡了多久啊
How long were you asleep at Selene's?

509
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:29,267
几年吧 也许几百年
A few years. Perhaps a few hundred.

510
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:30,847
可我从不会错的 
But I'm at right as gold. 

511
00:33:30,848 --> 00:33:32,704
你个傻子 你不会追踪
You're obsolete, man. You can't track.

512
00:33:32,738 --> 00:33:35,941
你连这玩意是啥都不知道
You don't even know what this thing is.

513
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:40,278
我当然知道 就是几排按钮嘛
Of course I do. It is a simple sequence of buttons.

514
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:47,885
如果你打开另一个维度大门 没有票的话
If you open the gate to another dimension without a ticket

515
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,688
我们都完蛋了
and we all go kaboom.

516
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:01,898
噢 不!
Oh no!

517
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:04,902
- 你还好吗? - 喔...
- Are you okay? - Ow...

518
00:34:04,936 --> 00:34:09,039
啊 你弄疼我了
Ohh... Oh, you hurt me.

519
00:34:09,073 --> 00:34:11,241
我很抱歉 艾迪 你还好吗?
I'm sorry. Eddy, are you okay?

520
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:16,980
你为何跟踪我们 为何费尽心思
Why are you following us? Why are you so hellbent

521
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:18,848
阻止我和艾迪一起工作?
on stopping me from working with Eddy?

522
00:34:18,883 --> 00:34:21,851
他不是艾迪
He is not Eddy.

523
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,460
我是艾迪
I'm Eddy.

524
00:34:34,477 --> 00:34:38,246
这女人叫西里欧 她可是个贼
This woman's name is Clio and she is a thief of identities!

525
00:34:38,281 --> 00:34:41,216
我能怎么办 你中了莎琳娜的魔咒
What was I supposed to do while you were under Selene's spell,

526
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,253
并困在她的腿间要求服务
and between her legs? Requests for your services were coming in.

527
00:34:45,288 --> 00:34:47,254
所以你吸取了他
So you took his gigs.

528
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:49,290
我最后记得把你塞进了裙子里
The last one that I recall put you in a hell of a dress.

529
00:34:49,324 --> 00:34:51,202
他在急着造人... 
All he was doing was making babies. 

530
00:34:51,203 --> 00:34:53,395
等等 难道艾迪是你...
Wait, is Eddy your...?

531
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:58,679
不不 他的卵都是自作聪明的元素
No. No, his spawn are giggling dim-witted Elementals.

532
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:01,435
- 可你就是元素 - 等着瞧
- But you're an Elemental. - With a twist.

533
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:05,973
这些元素只能控制四种元素之一
Those Elementals only have command one of the four elements.

534
00:35:06,008 --> 00:35:07,508
我能控制所有
I commune with all of them.

535
00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:10,978
这让我与众不同 比你强百倍
Which makes me very special and so much better than you.

536
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:12,279
骗子!
Lies!

537
00:35:12,314 --> 00:35:14,848
看到了吗? 从土中得知 那个人在此处
See? For example, from the Earth, that a man was killed

538
00:35:14,883 --> 00:35:17,885
被杀了六十五年之久
exactly in that spot 65 years ago.

539
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:21,356
可从水中得知 当时湿度是百分之三十二左右
And I can tell from the water, that the humidity is exactly 32 or 33%.

540
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:27,529
恩底弥翁啊 有火车正驶来
And Endymion, I know that a train is coming.

541
00:35:29,697 --> 00:35:33,800
你真是惹错人了
You have made a grave error in crossing me.

542
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:36,002
我四步就登上珠峰了
I mounted Everest in four strides,

543
00:35:36,037 --> 00:35:38,104
也曾登顶二十处子
and mounted the twenty virgins that live atop.

544
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:41,707
有歌儿赞颂我
There have been songs celebrating me.

545
00:35:41,742 --> 00:35:43,807
是啊 在一二九五年 
Yeah, in 1295. 

546
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,079
哥们 你现在碌碌无名了
Dude, you're all washed up.

547
00:35:46,113 --> 00:35:49,516
# 飞过大海 越过草坪 #
O'er the sea and across the glen,

548
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,752

# 迎来了月神恩底弥翁 #
comes the great and noble Endymion.  

549
00:35:52,786 --> 00:35:56,488
# 死亡和黑暗他公然违抗 # 
Death and darkness he doth defy, 
 

550
00:35:56,523 --> 00:36:00,859

# 想要杀他 他是不死之身 #
Try to kill him, and he will not die. 

551
00:36:03,546 --> 00:36:07,549

好吧 下趟车八点十五到
Okay. So the next train comes at quarter after eight.

552
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:10,985
我们需要张票 你有吗?
So we're gonna need a ticket. Do you have one?

553
00:36:12,889 --> 00:36:13,914
也许有哦 
You know, I might. 

554
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:16,260
是火车票? 什么是Mmxv?
It's a train ticket? So what's MMXV?

555
00:36:19,295 --> 00:36:21,762
那些不知如何发音的东西
Whatever unpronounceable thing that is.

556
00:36:21,797 --> 00:36:24,632
那是罗马数字 二零一五
They're Roman numerals, 2015.

557
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,739
我猜时间是晚上八点十五 
I'm guessing a time: 8:15 PM. 

558
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,468
要是快点我们还赶得及
If we hurry, we can make it.

559
00:36:28,503 --> 00:36:30,305
没人能碰卡片却不被烧到
No one can touch the card without being burned.

560
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:32,372
我能
I can.

561
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:35,576
- 她是元素 - 火烧不到我
- She's an Elemental. - Fire can't touch me.

562
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,315
我们可以谈谈我的价钱 
We should talk about my price. 

563
00:36:38,316 --> 00:36:39,980
要什么给什么
You'll get whatever you're owed.

564
00:36:40,014 --> 00:36:43,684
能等下吗? 谢谢你
Can we... can we have a second? Thank you.

565
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:49,689
好吧 首先 这什么元素的妹子有点神经质
Okay, A: Chickie-poo Elemental seems a little ele-mental.

566
00:36:49,723 --> 00:36:52,858
其次 她要把卡片拿走耍我们怎么办
B: She could take the card and bone us big.

567
00:36:52,893 --> 00:36:55,968
最后她的皮肤完美无瑕 我太恨她了
And C: Her skin is suspiciously flawless and I hate her so much.

568
00:36:56,003 --> 00:36:57,423
肯吉 你必须得呆在这 
kenez, you have to stay here. 

569
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:58,298
戴森 求你了
Dyson, please.

570
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:02,369
塔米辛也许会记得什么事 好吗?
Tamsin might remember something. All right?

571
00:37:02,603 --> 00:37:06,007
再说了 黑尔还要找你聊聊
And besides, Hale wants to talk to you about something.

572
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:12,112
他来的时候 耐心听听好吗?
And when he does, please try and listen to him, okay?

573
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:17,583
- 好吧 - 时间不等人哦
- Right. - Time's-a-ticking.

574
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:22,621
拜
Bye.

575
00:37:31,414 --> 00:37:33,982
开弓没有回头箭
Once we do this, there is no going back.

576
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:37,285
我也没办法承诺 我能保护你
And I can't promise you that I'm gonna be able to protect you.

577
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,322
你是谁? 你为什么想要救我?
Who are you? Why did you try to save me at Engelram's?

578
00:37:40,356 --> 00:37:43,919
嘿 我看到一小伙在派对上有麻烦
Hey! I saw a guy at a party in trouble

579
00:37:43,954 --> 00:37:46,149
还能顺便赚钱 何乐不为? 
and the chance to make a buck. Okay? 

580
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,028
我不相信
I don't buy that.

581
00:37:47,063 --> 00:37:51,199
你是警察 还有你的侦探朋友 她叫...
You're a cop, okay, and your sleuth friend, what's her...

582
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:54,836
- 肯吉 - 肯吉 我看你潜力不错
- Kenzi. - Kenzi. I saw you as potential competition,

583
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:57,872
在我的地盘探头探脑 我决定来看看你
who was busting in on my territory and I decided to check you out.

584
00:37:57,906 --> 00:38:00,408
结果是我多虑了
And it turns out that I have absolutely nothing to worry about.

585
00:38:00,442 --> 00:38:03,978
- 我能开始了吗? - 时间不等人
- So can I please do this? - Time's-a-ticking.

586
00:38:04,012 --> 00:38:06,976
好的
Okay.

587
00:38:13,088 --> 00:38:15,022
天啊 竟然有用啊
Oh man, that worked!

588
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:18,325
- 你怀疑过? - 没有 呃 也许有吧
- You're surprised? - No. I mean, maybe.

589
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:22,798
因为 这种多维度东西太难预测了
Because, ya know, this multidimensional stuff is quite unpredictable.

590
00:38:28,002 --> 00:38:29,268
戴森
Dyson.

591
00:38:29,303 --> 00:38:32,271
你的伤口怎么样了? 缝针愈合了吗?
So how's your incision? Did the stitches heal?

592
00:38:34,141 --> 00:38:36,610
- 劳伦 - 戴森 我想回家
- Lauren. - Dyson, I want to come home.

593
00:38:36,644 --> 00:38:38,512
他们还在找你 很不安全
They're still looking for you. It's not safe.

594
00:38:38,546 --> 00:38:40,814
其他人呢? 波呢?
What about the others? What about Bo?

595
00:38:40,848 --> 00:38:42,315
戴森 我很害怕
Dyson, I'm scared.

596
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:45,284
劳伦 我不知道你是最棒还是最糟的对手
Lauren, I don't know if you're the best rival or worst, but I know

597
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:47,520
但我知道 你聪明伶俐 足智多谋
this, you are smart and you are resourceful.

598
00:38:47,554 --> 00:38:49,522
不管要做什么 你快做吧
So whatever needs to get done, you do it.

599
00:38:49,556 --> 00:38:51,957
因为目前来看 你孑然一身
Because right now you're on your own.

600
00:38:51,992 --> 00:38:55,096
谢谢 戴森 请照顾好她
Thanks. And Dyson, take care of her, please.

601
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:07,706
我会付他们付你的三倍价钱
I'll give you triple what they're paying ya.

602
00:39:07,741 --> 00:39:09,708
亲爱的 我当然付得起
Of course I can afford it, darling.

603
00:39:09,743 --> 00:39:12,177
全族灭绝的好处就是
The positive of having your entire race obliterated

604
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:15,848
继承了一大笔遗产啊
is that you inherit one big bloody bank account.

605
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:21,153
可是有句话要说清楚
But we must be clear about one thing.

606
00:39:21,187 --> 00:39:24,322
波必须完完整整的活着
Bo must be alive and in one piece.

607
00:39:24,357 --> 00:39:26,191
说定了?
Now do we have a deal?

608
00:39:26,225 --> 00:39:28,026
当然 
Absolutely.

609
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:33,031
你个小妖精 让我都激凸了
Well, erect my nipples, you are a naughty little minx.

610
00:39:33,065 --> 00:39:36,034
再跟我讲一次 慢慢地
Tell me again... slowly.

611
00:39:38,604 --> 00:39:42,075
- 我们说定了 - 什么说定了?
- Uh, we have a deal. - What deal?

612
00:39:44,109 --> 00:39:48,481
我不能说 是客户的私人保密信息
I cannot reveal that. That's privileged client information.

613
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:52,015
可是...
But...

614
00:39:53,751 --> 00:39:56,153
你有我的血誓
you have my blood oath

615
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:59,457
我会找到你的淫妖
that I will find your Succubus.

616
00:40:12,737 --> 00:40:17,223
该死 好戏上演了 那是死亡列车
Shit's about to get interesting. That's a Death Train.

617
00:40:18,342 --> 00:40:22,378
想都别想
Uh, uh, uh. Don't even think about it.

618
00:40:30,754 --> 00:40:34,724
稍安勿躁 今晚路途遥远
Hold onto your knickers. Tonight's gonna be a wild ride.

619
00:40:41,534 --> 00:40:45,261
是的 没了 再没有了 跟魔力永别
Yes, gone. No more. Sayonara magic tinkle powers. 

620
00:40:45,296 --> 00:40:47,430
你今晚能见我吗?
Can you meet me tonight?

621
00:40:50,934 --> 00:40:55,179
我能付起 好的到时见
Duh, I can pay. Yeah I'll see you there.

622
00:41:14,757 --> 00:41:18,059
- 感觉好些了? - 我压跟没感觉
- Feel better? - I barely feel anything.

623
00:41:18,094 --> 00:41:20,095
我要尿尿啦
I'm gonna go pee.

624
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,274
密码 该死
Password. Shit.

625
00:41:33,308 --> 00:41:34,909
也许就是"该死"呢
Maybe it's "shit."

626
00:41:37,113 --> 00:41:41,816
托德 我小时候狗的名字
Toad. It was my dog's name when I was a kid.

627
00:41:41,851 --> 00:41:45,052
T-o-a-d 很讽刺吧?
T-O-A-D. It's ironical, huh?

628
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,121
我刚看你天气预报呢
I was just looking for your weather app.

629
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:49,590
八六二三 你看吧
8623. You can go ahead.

630
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:56,764
看起来是晴天 你没信我 对吧?
Look it's sunny, with a side... You're not buying this, are you?

631
00:41:56,798 --> 00:41:59,500
这是那个外星视频
This is about that alien video.

632
00:41:59,535 --> 00:42:02,703
你知道多少人付钱要这玩意吗?
Do you know how much people will pay for shit like this?

633
00:42:02,737 --> 00:42:06,807
这不是外星人 这视频不存在
Look, it wasn't an alien, but this video cannot exist.

634
00:42:06,841 --> 00:42:08,942
有些坏人在追我
There are some very bad people after me,

635
00:42:08,977 --> 00:42:11,244
他们要是看到这个 会找到我
and if they see this, they'll come for me.

636
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:15,082
我真想多告诉你些 可是...
I wish I could tell you more, but it's just...

637
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:16,784
真很复杂
It's complicated.

638
00:42:37,537 --> 00:42:40,306
要是你在我手机上删东西 我就有这福利
If this is what I get for letting you delete things on my phone

639
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,842
那我该让你知道 我有超过三十张
I should let you know, I have over 30 Instagrams

640
00:42:42,876 --> 00:42:45,611
在加油站拍得三明治照片
of gas station sandwiches on here.

641
00:42:45,645 --> 00:42:49,481
- 我是劳伦 - 很高兴见到你 劳伦
- I'm Lauren. - It's nice to meet you, Lauren.

642
00:42:49,516 --> 00:42:51,183
谢谢你
Thank you.

643
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,434
够了 够能量离开了
Just enough. Just enough to get out.

644
00:43:23,148 --> 00:43:25,049
该走了
It's time to go.
