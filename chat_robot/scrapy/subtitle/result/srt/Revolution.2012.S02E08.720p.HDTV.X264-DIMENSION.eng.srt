1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,550
Previously on Revolution...

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,160
Why'd you do it? 'Cause we needed him and you asked me to.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,100
You have to tell me where my son is. One thing at a time.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,020
You set off a bomb in my town.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,560
Your job is to keep our town healthy and compliant,

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,940
unless you're not a loyal American.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,880
You can't fix him. It's the training.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,890
You cut him loose, he will kill us both.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,850
You were so worried about trusting my son, when you should've been worried about trusting me.

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,830
You said your husband was Patriot high command? What do you want?

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,040
Where is the old ball and chain? I'd like to pick your brain about the nanotech.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,170
He's already onto the bodies. Aaron, it's only a matter of time before Horn is onto you.

13
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,320
So where are they?

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,390
I did not want to be right about this. He's one of them.

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,230
We got to get Aaron out of here. I'm Aaron Pittman! I'll come quietly!

16
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,390
Just leave her alone!

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,620
Aaron, you have got to tell me how you do that.

18
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,730
You don't have to be afraid of him, but it's not him you're afraid of, is it?

19
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,650
Why don't you tell me what's going on, please?

Where's Horn?

Where's Horn?

23
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,870
I haven't seen the son of a bitch in a while,

24
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,130
but I'm pretty sure you know where he's holed up.

25
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,740
He's working.

26
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,010
Always working. Working where?

27
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,670
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

28
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,300
Is that right? Horn's looking for you.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,430
He's got men everywhere looking for you...

30
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,180
and her...

31
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,660
and Pittman.

32
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,020
and once he finds you...

33
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,550
know what he's gonna do?

34
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,010
Of course I do.

35
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,450
That's why I'm gonna find him first.

36
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,670
So let's try this one more time.

37
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,350
Where is he?

38
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,300
I know, I know.

39
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,640
The bombing rocked all of us.

40
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,430
It was a tragedy and an act of cowardice,

41
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,590
plain and simple.

42
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,460
And, folks...

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,420
We now know who was behind the bombing...

44
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,930
the man who stood amongst us and called himself Stu Redman.

45
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,440
But his real name is Miles Matheson.

46
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,400
You may have heard of him...

47
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,630
General Miles Matheson of the Monroe Republic.

48
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,290
Now, we have reason to believe he was acting in retaliation

49
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,710
for the execution of his former leader...

50
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,020
Sebastian Monroe,

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,270
and he didn't act alone.

52
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,870
He had an accomplice...

53
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,880
Aaron Pittman.

54
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,300
Uh, yeah.

55
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,650
Matheson and Pittman pulled the wool over our eyes,

56
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,870
yours and mine.

57
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,770
My daughter also came to town with them.

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,360
She was troubled psychologically.

59
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,530
Some of you know that.

60
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,530
She had nothing to do with any of this. She and my granddaughter are victims,

61
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,800
manipulated by these men.

62
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:55,370
So, please, if you see them, report it to a U.S. officer.

63
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,490
I'm begging you, help me find them.

64
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,230
I just want my family safe.

65
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,650
They said they'd meet us here, they'll meet us here.

66
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,400
Well, I got news for you, stay puft.

67
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,750
There might have been a change of plan.

68
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,650
What change of plan?

69
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,560
In that this plan has gone to hell.

70
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,550
Those Patriot sons of bitches were waiting for you. And we don't know what happened.

71
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,700
We don't know if Miles can even get out of town or if he's still alive.

72
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,370
We're gonna wait right here like Miles told us to.

73
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,010
Okay,whoa, okay, okay.

74
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,330
Just don't light me on fire or anything.

75
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,390
Who's that?

76
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,270
Nobody.

77
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,900
Just some intel.

78
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,410
What's it like out there?

79
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,460
It's not good. Truman told everyone who Miles really is.

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,140
Said that Miles is the one that blew up the building and that he's the terrorist.

81
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,100
Did you see your grandfather?

82
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,000
- Charlie? - Yeah.

83
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,380
Look, mom, we got to find a way out of town now.

84
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,140
Not yet. Why not? Aaron's waiting for us.

85
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,010
This is for Aaron, trust me.

86
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,540
They will never give up.

87
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,360
They will never stop looking for him unless we kill Horn first.

88
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,990
They're calling us terrorists.

89
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,500
Just you wait.

State your business.

99
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,270
Just... give him this.

100
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,190
Tell him...

101
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,140
I only speak to him.

102
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,610
Those real?

103

A little privacy, gentlemen.

104
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,780
Is she alive?

105
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,310
Yes, sir.

106
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,200
She is.

107
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,570
Where is she? Tied up...

108
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,720
safe, hidden.

109
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,260
You've got a lot of balls coming into my office

110
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,730
and telling me you've got my wife captive.

111
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,930
With all due respect, sir,

112
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,340
your wife is an enemy of the United States of America.

113
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,270
I figured that you were a good Patriot.

114
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,870
Am I wrong?

115
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,740
She's guilty of sedition.

116
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,030
She should be punished.

117
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,000
So why not bring her in?

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,960
My guess is that you have

119
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,100
a dark and stormy cloud over your head,

120
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,960
over an otherwise spotless career.

121
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,050
I mean, your wife is a traitor.

122
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,990
People have to be whispering whether or not you were pillow-talking,

123
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,020
whether or not any of it rubbed off on you.

124
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:23,500
But if you brought your wife in by yourself,

125
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,860
delivered her unto justice,

126
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,650
that would solve all of your problems, wouldn't it?

127
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,310
Turn that rain into sunshine.

128
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,390
And why would you do this for me?

129
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,470
Honestly?

130
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,770
I'm ambitious.

131
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,640
And I think there's value

132
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,410
in being friends with a man like you.

133
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,040
So, Commander...

134
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,820
would you like to come and see the missus?

138
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,670
I thought you were their beloved Dr. Porter.

139
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,690
Someone will know where Pittman is... I'll find him.

140
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,980
Do you know what'll happen to your daughter if you don't?

141
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,790
Or your granddaughter?

142
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,140
Threatening me won't find him any faster.

143
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,960
Someone knows something.

144
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,420
How about we get everyone Pittman knows,

145
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,410
march them into town square, and start executing them?

146
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,830
I bet they'll talk then.

147
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,650
I have put a hell of a lot of time into managing this town.

148
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,820
We have a plan.

149
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,650
Right, the plan...

150
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,390
taking town after town.

151
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,120
And how many years until you take the whole continent?

152
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,980
If I get my hands on Pittman

153
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,000
and figure out what makes him tick,

154
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,170
we take everything in months.

155
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,160
That's all.

156
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,750
Here, I found this.

157
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,040
LILTAW

158
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,070
What is that?

159
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,340
What is this, food?

160
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,140
People used to think so, yeah.

161
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,690
I know you're angry,

162
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,820
and I'm not apologizing for him.

163
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,710
But you don't know why grandpa did what he did.

164
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,200
He sold us out. He works for them.

165
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,160
Yeah, I get it. You hate him for it.

166
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,730
You don't?

167
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,160
No.

168
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,330
Well, you're a better person than me.

169
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,460
No, I'm not.

170
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,190
I hated you for a long time

171
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,710
for abandoning Danny and me...

172
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,300
for killing Nora.

173
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,740
That's not fair.

174
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,730
This is different.

175
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,690
All I'm saying is hating you was the easy part.

176
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,590
But letting it go?

177
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,600
That's hard.

178
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,490
It's like EPCOT East Berlin out there.

179
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,290
They have dogs.

180
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,350
When the hell did they get dogs?

181
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,750
You find the place?

182
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,550
The guy's intel was legit. Basement of the old paper factory.

183
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,760
Definitely their H.Q. Is there any way to get in there,

184
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,790
drop some kind of device? Not gonna be easy.

185
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,130
Place is sealed up tighter than a drum.

186
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,630
And, uh, Rachel, the...

187
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,740
there's something else.

188
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,260
I... I saw Truman walking in.

189
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,370
Good. Two birds, one stone.

190
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,770
Walking in with Gene.

191
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,780
You should try to sleep.

192
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,630
You haven't said a word all day.

193
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,820
Come on...

194
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,900
talk to me.

195
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,850
Did you kill Carl?

196
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,240
What?

197
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,520
Did you kill my husband?

198
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,160
The way he died,

199
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,410
the fire in the car,

200
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,330
it was always strange.

201
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,270
He hit me.

202
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,680
Oh, my...

203
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,320
oh, God.

204
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,050
Oh, God, Aaron.

205
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,700
I got angry, and I couldn't control it.

206
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,210
You know I can't control it.

207
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,470
You lied to me.

208
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,940
You murdered him, and you slept in my bed...

209
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,070
and you lied about it.

210
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,990
I'm sorry.

211
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,220
I didn't know how to explain it.

212
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,690
I've had enough liars in my life.

213
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,760
Cynthia...

214
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,190
Just leave me alone.

215
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,100
I need to think.

216
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,160
What?

217
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,420
I always dreamed of cooking with my daughter,

218
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,150
just not like this.

219
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,060
You sure this stuff is safe to carry?

220
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,130
Separately they're fine.

221
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,840
But drop this with this down an air shaft

222
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,720
into a locked up basement?

223
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,920
The gas will kill Horn and everyone else inside.

224
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,100
So when the time comes to do this,

225
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,560
what if grandpa's there?

226
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,450
Let's just hope that he's not.

227
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,470
Okay, but if he is,

228
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,120
you're not gonna go through with it, right?

229
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,800
Mom?

230
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,790
Where the hell are you going?

231
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,350
You're just gonna leave us?

232
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,580
Look, if Miles was coming, he would've been here by now.

233
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,310
I'm gonna go find him. And what if they find us?

234
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,630
All right, just... just hold on, hold on.

235
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,350
We wouldn't last three days without you.

236
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,540
You think three?

237
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,890
Look, Miles has got some information that I need, someone I need to find.

238
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,600
I held up my end of the bargain.

239
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,660
Now it's his turn...

240
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,740
that's if he's even alive.

241
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,710
You they won't kill.

242
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,980
Me on the other hand...

243
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,810
What? What the hell are you doing?

244
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,750
Aaron!

245
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,690
Aaron, help!

246
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,610
Cynthia!

247
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,090
Help!

248
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,400
Aaron!

249
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,110
Aaron!

250
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,670
Aaron!

251
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,630
MARCUS HORN

252
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,650
(MARCUS HORN)
18 YEARS BEFORE THE BLACKOUT

253
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,790
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...

254
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,760
Dad.

255
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,910
- I will fear no evil for thou art with me. - Dad...

256
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,200
She's not getting any better.

257
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,790
She will.

258
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,370
God won't take her from me.

259
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,420
What if there's something more that we could do for her?

260
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,780
I'm praying as hard as I know how.

261
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,320
Gary's father is a doctor.

262
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,900
Maybe he could come and see her.

263
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,950
- He... he could... - He could what?

264
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,930
We cannot control the lord's will.

265
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,290
Now, you know that.

266
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,670
Now come pray with me, boy.

267
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:28,280
The lord is my Shepherd. I shall not want.

268
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,570
We know that through you...

269
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,880
Oh, no.

270
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,520
She can't.

271
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,940
It's her decision to make.

272
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,980
Dr. Porter, what are you doing here?

273
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,190
We have the doctor to thank for finding you.

274
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,510
Searching the boatyard was his idea.

275
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,850
Gene?

276
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,610
Horn, let her go.

277
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,680
Please...

278
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,200
she's... she's got nothing to do with it. Please.

279
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,300
I'm sorry. I need insurance, Aaron.

280
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,520
Can't have one of your pyrotechnic displays.

281
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,480
As long as you cooperate, she'll be fine.

282
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,710
You son of a bitch.

283
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:46,190
Let her go. Let her go. Cynthia, I'm sorry.

284
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,570
I'm sorry.

285
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,940
Aaron's inside.

286
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,620
18 YEARS BEFORE THE BLACKOUT

287
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,640
Dad?

288
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,530
What have you done, Calvin?

289
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,080
Gary's father gave them to me.

290
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,510
I didn't want her to die.

291
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,640
Well, she died because of you.

292
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,280
You prayed for a miracle.

293
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,580
But there are no miracles.

294
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,730
Please, do anything you want to me.

295
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,820
Just please let her go.

296
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,680
There.

297
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,400
That should keep you nice and relaxed.

298
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,160
They tell me you came back from the dead, Aaron...

299
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,990
2 1/2 hours without a heartbeat.

300
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,060
That would make you a modern-day Lazarus, wouldn't it?

301
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,990
That is, if you believed in that sort of thing.

302
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,700
So what say we start

303
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,060
by seeing how resilient your body really is.

304
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,660
- You're free to go, doctor. - I'm staying.

305
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,830
If you're going to hurt him,

306
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,420
I want to be here to help him.

307
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,210
How do we know pain isn't an important part of it?

308
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,720
No, you did your part bringing him here.

309
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,600
Thank you.

310
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:16,050
And as promised, as long as your daughter doesn't look for any more trouble,

311
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,570
I won't go looking for her.

312
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,800
Now, doctor.

313
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,950
GLENDON,NORTH CAROLINA

314
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,090
Jason, please.

315
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,160
Please...

316
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,600
just let me go. Why are you doing this?

317
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,690
Is it because your father's telling you to?

318
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,700
Shut up.

319
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,830
You always follow the man's orders?

320
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,230
I said shut up.

321
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,370
He let you get shipped off to that reeducation center.

322
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,680
He didn't try to stop it. He didn't say a word.

323
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,940
You know, he doesn't give a damn about you, and you just...

324
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,990
Jason...

325
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,530
you're not fully deprogrammed, are you?

326
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,570
Not completely...

327
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,980
not all the way.

328
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,850
- How much further? - Just up ahead.

329
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,650
Do we have a problem?

330
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,610
Did you hurt her?

331
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,980
I wondered if something like this might happen.

332
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,510
You're still sweet on the woman.

333
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:50,550
Well, first thing you need to know, I have a man on her.

334
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,690
You try walking in there without me, it'll be a short reunion.

335
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,300
So how about we put the gun down?

336
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,360
No, this is what's gonna happen.

337
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,260
You're gonna take me in there, and you're gonna let my wife go.

338
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,120
And then? What?

339
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,520
You two run off together,

340
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,380
escape like two star-crossed teens?

341
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,830
Boy, she must be worth it.

342
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:14,130
She must give it to you good and sweet.

343
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,930
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

344
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,800
I thought I was talking to a man with his head on straight.

345
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,400
If I bring her back...

346
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:26,710
they'll kill her.

347
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,870
You cut her loose and run off,

348
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,910
they'll hunt you down and kill you both.

349
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,720
How far do you think you're gonna make it

350
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,550
with your soft hands and your fine art?

351
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,950
Be realistic.

352
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,930
Your wife went rogue without a single thought

353
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:44,630
of what it might do to you or your son.

354
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,280
And if the boy has two traitor parents,

355
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,390
what do you think they're gonna do to him?

356
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,780
The only question is,

357
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,560
what side of this are you gonna land on?

358
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,710
Charlie?

359
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,000
What the hell are you still doing in town?

360
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,650
You should be miles from here. We can't.

361
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,660
Aaron's our family.

362
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,370
How'd they find him, Gene?

363
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:47,990
I found him.

364
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,370
And what's Horn doing with him? I don't know.

365
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,710
He's still alive... for now.

366
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,320
Grandpa, how could you?

367
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,620
They were gonna kill you if I didn't.

368
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,640
What else was I supposed to do?

369
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,250
How about the right thing?

370
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,800
How about everything that you taught me?

371
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,030
Okay.

372
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,610
We're gonna get Aaron out of there,

373
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,580
and you are gonna help. There's nothing I can do.

374
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,970
You can't get in. It's too late.

375
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,130
- And whose fault is that? - I was trying to keep you safe.

376
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,070
Really?

377
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,720
By lying to me?

378
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,670
By letting me think that I was crazy?

379
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,100
How was that supposed to help?

380
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,390
Your mother...

381
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,370
died of an awful disease.

382
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,940
There was nothing I could do

383
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,430
except watch her waste away.

384
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,530
And suddenly...

385
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,350
I had a chance to save everybody.

386
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,880
They gave me medicine.

387
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,900
No one else had to die like she did.

388
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,830
I didn't realize who they were

389
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,050
until it was too late.

390
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,760
But, Rachel...

391
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,380
it's too late.

392
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,660
You rolled over.

393
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,840
You helped them.

394
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,640
You've never done a bad thing for a good reason?

395
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,380
What about you, Miles?

396
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,310
Dad...

397
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,370
how am I ever supposed to forgive you for this?

398
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,370
You're not.

399
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,360
I don't want it.

400
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,720
If keeping you alive...

401
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,210
means you hate me, then you just hate me.

402
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:09,340
But for God's sake, run.

403
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,590
Run.

404
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,190
I know you all are in there!

405
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:23,530
You got one minute to surrender yourselves and come on out,

406
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,450
or we're coming in.

407
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,860
Get them out, Gene, or else this ends bloody.

408
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,830
You son of a bitch. I didn't know, I swear.

409
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,920
Look...

410
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,590
I can...

411
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,130
let me stay behind.

412
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,750
Maybe I can buy you a couple of minutes.

413
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,500
Please.

414
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,870
No.

415
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,910
You have to come with us. He's coming with us.

416
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,960
Prepare to fire.

417
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,710
What is this, Gene?

418
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,140
Where are they?

419
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,090
Horn said he was gonna leave my daughter alone.

420
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,990
And he will.

421
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,910
But Miles Matheson bombed the town, remember?

422
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:35,470
Now, you hand him over, and your daughter walks free.

423
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,090
I heard that one before, Ed.

424
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,040
It's the truth.

425
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,500
Any one of you takes a step forward toward that building,

426
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,760
this man dies. Big mistake here, Gene.

427
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,260
I've made worse.

428
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,350
Go, damn it!

429
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,310
Unbelievable.

430
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,090
Why you, Aaron?

431
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,070
The nanites in your body are behaving in a highly individual way,

432
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,910
repairing your cells,

433
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,770
oxygenating your blood.

434
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,320
But why?

435
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,920
Why only you?

436
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,340
I have no idea.

437
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,780
You think of me as your enemy.

438
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,710
But we're partners now.

439
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,530
You know, my father believed there was a magic,

440
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:22,070
 invisible power all around us,

441
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,880
and if he prayed hard enough,

442
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,710
it would grant him a miracle.

443
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,860
He was a horrible, stupid man

444
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,230
who based his whole life on a fairy tale.

445
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,620
But it's ironic.

446
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,060
Turns out he was right...

447
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,520
sort of.

448
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,010
There is an invisible power that can save people.

449
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,440
It just doesn't come from heaven, that's all.

450
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,460
But I have to admit,

451
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,110
it is, in its own way,

452
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,260
a miracle.

453
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,260
You're gonna teach me how to use it.

454
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,460
I can't.

455
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,060
I don't know how.

456
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,480
Then we'll figure it out together.

457
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,430
It's important.

458
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,290
I have a tumor growing in my brain,

459
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,950
and the symptoms are getting worse.

460
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:44,450
And I'd lost all hope. Then I heard about you.

461
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,850
Aaron...

462
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,610
I need you to deliver me that miracle.

463
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,950
And I believe that you can.

464
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,870
Jason!

465
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,180
Easy, boy.

466
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,380
Everything's under control.

467
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,050
Roger.

468
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,380
Justine.

469
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,880
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

470
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,940
Writing that letter...

471
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,760
was stupid.

472
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,970
You knew how they would react.

473
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,980
What they did to Max, to our baby boy...

474
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,240
I didn't want them to do that to anyone else.

475
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,200
You know how much trouble you're in now...

476
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,720
how much trouble we're both in because of you?

477
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,030
I'm sorry.

478
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,650
You got to stay clearheaded about this.

479
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,950
Roger, this is a dangerous man.

480
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:18,410
You can kill them both, and we can run.

481
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,840
Where?

482
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,100
Huh? Where? Where can we go?

483
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,860
Got to be realistic.

484
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,910
Roger...

485
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,840
I love you.

486
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,840
I love you too. Roger, no!

487
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,800
So how are we gonna get Aaron now?

488
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,980
And dad.

489
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,320
Yeah, that's right.

490
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,010
We're gonna go get your grandfather.

491
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,230
If either of you have any bright ideas, I'd love to hear them.

492
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,860
So here's what we've learned.

493
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:42,940
Self-healing occurs as a direct reaction to physical trauma,

494
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,220
like a lizard regrowing its tail...

495
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,740
but your defensive actions,

496
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,300
burning people alive and all that,

497
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,380
are a response to emotional stimuli.

498
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,820
That's what the next phase is all about.

499
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,090
Here you go.

500
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,730
This one should perk you right up.

501
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,270
Aaron!

502
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,960
What are you gonna do? Sorry.

503
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:33,940
I am, but we need to elevate you to a proper emotional state.

504
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,000
Then maybe...

505
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,530
maybe you can heal someone else.

506
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,310
No. Please!

507
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,600
You said you weren't gonna hurt her.

508
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,260
I'll check in in a bit.

509
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,580
This room may not be the safest place to be right now.

510
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,540
Stop!

511
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:10,970
No!

512
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,800
