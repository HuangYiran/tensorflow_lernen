00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:02,203
东区女巫前情提要...
Previously, on Witches of East End...

2
00:00:02,204 --> 00:00:05,724
你的项链 变红了 这是你最后一条命了
Your necklace, it's red. This is your last life.

3
00:00:05,725 --> 00:00:08,182
你也许应该走开了
You should probably move along now.

4
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:10,937
你不必这么做的 我可以自己照顾自己
You didn't have to do that. I can take care of myself.

5
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:13,491
你没什么可担心的
You have nothing to worry about.

6
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,755
我只是想确定我没有成为第三者
I just want to make sure I'm not getting in the middle of something.

7
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:17,119
只是一个吻而已 
It was just a kiss, 

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,529
我们绝对不会告诉任何人 因为这已经结束了
and we are never, ever going to tell anyone because it's over.

9
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,285
我在图书馆听到你的话了 我要一早去伦敦
I heard you at the library. I'm leaving early for London.

10
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:28,826
我不是你母亲 你认识我 我是雅典娜
I'm not your mother. You knew me as Athena.

11
00:00:28,827 --> 00:00:31,790
- 我为什么会在这里? - 巨蛇座
- Why am I here? - Serpens clavem.

12
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:32,955
它是一条金色的蛇 
It's a golden snake. 

13
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:34,509
尾巴看起来像一把钥匙
The tail looks like a key.

14
00:00:34,543 --> 00:00:38,046
我要你说服你姨妈把它交出来
I need you to convince your aunt to give it back.

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,098
只要你告诉我蛇钥匙在哪里 这一切就会结束
This will end if you tell me where the snake is.

16
00:00:40,132 --> 00:00:41,643
它已经没了
It's gone.

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,412
她说一个是你的灵魂伴侣 
She said one is your soul mate, 

18
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,023
另一个 是你的冤家?
and the other, your destroyer?

19
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:50,191
意思是其中一个会把你杀死吗?
Does that mean one of them is gonna kill you?

20
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:52,672
这是个比喻 英格丽德 塔罗牌可是很狡猾的
It's a metaphor, Ingrid. Tarot cards are tricky that way.

21
00:00:52,673 --> 00:00:54,424
你觉得基利安是你的冤家吗?
And you think Killian is the destroyer?

22
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:56,111
很明显啊 所有这些麻烦
Obviously. All this trouble 

23
00:00:56,112 --> 00:00:57,644
都始于我认识他的那晚
started the night I met him.

24
00:00:57,645 --> 00:01:00,935
他就是我失去达什的原因 他当然是我的冤家
He's the reason I lost Dash. Damn right he's the destroyer.

25
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:02,437
...什么 两分钟 还...
...what, two minutes, and...

26
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:04,318
那 你打算怎么办?
So, what are you gonna do?

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,199
我能怎么办? 达什现在在伦敦 
What can I do? Dash is in London. 

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,543
他都不回我电话
He's not returning any of my calls.

29
00:01:08,577 --> 00:01:11,112
他现在恨死我了... 是我活该
He hates me right now... And rightfully so.

30
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:16,776
- 请慢用 - 弗雷娅 我很抱歉
- Enjoy. - Freya, I'm so sorry.

31
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:19,182
没事 我不会让基利安毁了我的...
It's okay. I am not gonna let Killian destroy me...

32
00:01:19,183 --> 00:01:21,556
我要把这些伤心都变成美好
I'm gonna trade all this heartbreak for good.

33
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,880
就像那对苦命夫妻一样 看
Like for that angry couple back there. Watch.

34
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:26,267
...一定有什么事...  
...something that's been going on...  

35
00:01:26,268 --> 00:01:26,961
听着 我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry.

36
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:29,137
- 我们不要再这么做了 - 好
- Let's not do that again. - Okay.

37
00:01:29,138 --> 00:01:30,986
你刚才做了什么?
What did you just do?

38
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:33,621
用点小心思 给他们一个"爱的突袭"
Gave 'em a "Rush of Love," with a twist.

39
00:01:33,648 --> 00:01:36,200
天哪 你太棒了
Damn, you're good.

40
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:38,369
我的生活也许很混乱 
My life may be in shambles, 

41
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,189
不过至少我能让别人高兴起来
but at least I can make someone else happy.

42
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:47,211
花朵...
Flore...

43
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:50,264
凋零
Pulchre.

44
00:01:50,298 --> 00:01:51,849
花朵..
Flore...

45
00:01:51,883 --> 00:01:54,752
重生
Veneficus.

46
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:18,909
东区女巫 第一季第08集

47
00:02:22,947 --> 00:02:25,616
- 温迪 - 嘿
- Wendy. - Hey.

48
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:29,375
- 嘿 - 怎么了?
- Hey. - What's up?

49
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:37,163
我要给你看一样东西
I need to show you something,

50
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:40,183
不过...
and, uh...

51
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:43,629
我希望你不要生我的气
I don't want you to get angry with me.

52
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,722
好吧 我为什么要生气呢?
Okay, why would I be angry?

53
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:53,446
入口钥匙?!
The portal key!?

54
00:02:53,753 --> 00:02:56,682
究竟怎么回事! 你说过它已经被毁了的
What the hell! You said that was destroyed.

55
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,368
- 我说谎了 - 你说谎...?
- I lied. - You lied...?

56
00:02:59,403 --> 00:03:01,626
就因为这把钥匙我被杀了! 
I was killed over that key! 

57
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:03,507
现在我只有最后一条命了
I'm on my last life now.

58
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:05,747
- 我很抱歉 - 你很抱歉!
- I am so sorry. - You're so sorry!

59
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:08,657
你向我保证不生气的
You promised me that you were not gonna get angry.

60
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:09,858
不 我没有
No, I didn't.

61
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:11,943
- 我听见你说了! - 不 我没说!
- I heard you! - No, I didn't!

62
00:03:11,944 --> 00:03:14,546
你在干什么呢 乔安娜? 怎么回事?
What are you doing, Joanna? What happened?

63
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,449
为什么假冒者会以为是我偷了它?
And why did the shifter think that I stole it?

64
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:23,288
我不知道 不知道
I have no idea. I don't know.

65
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:27,792
- 乔... - 无疑阿奇博尔德想得到它
- Jo... - Archibald wanted it, for sure.

66
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,729
- 是吗? - 他甚至怀疑东西在我们这里
- Yeah? - And he even suspected that we had it,

67
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:32,835
不过他没想出它在什么地方
but he's never figured out where it was,

68
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:34,750
我已经把它藏了几百年了
and I've kept it hidden for centuries.

69
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:36,835
假冒者知道我们住在哪里 乔安娜
The shifter knows where we live, Joanna.

70
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:39,421
- 温迪 我搞砸了 - 对 你搞砸了
- Wendy, I messed up. - Yeah, you messed up.

71
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:42,842
我们密封了入口钥匙你却告诉我它已经被毁了
You told me that thing was destroyed after we sealed the portal.

72
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:44,018
我很相信你 
I believed you. 

73
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,144
我知道 我也说了...
I know. And like I said...

74
00:03:46,162 --> 00:03:47,579
你说谎了
You lied.

75
00:03:47,613 --> 00:03:51,116
你为什么要保留巨蛇座?
Why would you keep that snake?

76
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,584
它...
It's...

77
00:03:52,618 --> 00:03:55,965
很诱惑很败坏又很讨厌
Seductive and corrupting and poisonous.

78
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:58,439
我们都知道它会对人们做出什么事
You and I both know what it does to people.

79
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,691
你为什么还一直保存着它?
Why would you keep it this whole time?

80
00:04:02,845 --> 00:04:05,263
你以为你某天会用上它
You thought that you might use it again someday.

81
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:09,634
难以置信! 你还说我鲁莽呢
Unbelievable! And you call me the reckless one.

82
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:13,438
你知道我们再也回不去了 乔安娜
You know that we can never go back there, Joanna.

83
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:15,237
你为什么想回到过去呢? 
Why would you want to? 

84
00:04:15,238 --> 00:04:17,150
现在我们的生活比以前好多了
Our lives so much better here.

85
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,989
我从没用过它 温迪 我也没打算用它
I've never used it, Wendy, I don't plan to use it,

86
00:04:20,023 --> 00:04:22,174
不过我不会把它丢掉... 
but I'm not getting rid of it... 

87
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:24,326
这是我跟我们家族唯一的连结
It is my only connection with our home.

88
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:28,387
温迪...
Wendy...

89
00:04:28,403 --> 00:04:31,405
我觉得这样很不好
I don't feel good about this.

90
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:39,258
- 嘿 抱歉我迟到了 - 嘿 没事 没事
- Hey. Sorry I'm late. - Hey. Oh, no problem, no problem.

91
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,877
发生什么事了? 弗雷娅的婚礼取消了吗?
So, what happened? Is Freya's wedding off?

92
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:43,429
也许 很可能
Maybe. Probably.

93
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:46,265
真希望我能帮上什么忙
Oh, I just wish there was something I could do to help.

94
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:48,477
好吧 要是能让你好受点的话
Well, if it makes you feel better,

95
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:50,436
有个人你还真能帮呢
there's someone else here that you can help.

96
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,159
他们想借书吗?
Do they want to check out a book?

97
00:04:52,185 --> 00:04:54,669
貌似他想借的是你
Seems like he wants to check you out.

98
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:58,360
那是迈克
Oh, that's just Mike.

99
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:01,697
就是他在内战走廊救了你?
That's the guy that saved you in the Civil War aisle?

100
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:03,532
你没告诉我他有这么帅啊
You didn't tell me how cute he was.

101
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,819
- 你觉得帅吗? - 是啊
- You think so? - Yeah.

102
00:05:08,604 --> 00:05:11,606
巴布 不 我... 我又不是在逛超市
Barb, no, I'm... I'm not in the market.

103
00:05:11,624 --> 00:05:13,775
好吧 我不会说服你嫁给他
Oh, well, I'm not telling you to marry him.

104
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:15,911
我甚至不想让你跟他约会
I'm not even telling you to date him.

105
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:19,968
不过我希望你过去帮帮他
But I am telling you to go over there and help him.

106
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:24,720
嘿 迈克
Hey, Mike.

107
00:05:24,754 --> 00:05:28,941
- 英格丽德 见到你很高兴 - 怎么了?
- Ingrid, I am so glad to see you. - What's going on?

108
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:31,779
我听说你很了解东区的历史
I hear you know a lot about the history of East End.

109
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,060
对 我研究过一些 你想知道什么?
I have studied some, yes. What do you want to know?

110
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:35,384
所有的一切
Everything.

111
00:05:35,385 --> 00:05:37,487
我有一部历史虚构小说 
My novel is historical fiction, 

112
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:39,399
正进行到二十世纪之交
set here at the turn of the 20th century,

113
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,237
我很希望能借用一下专家的观点
and I could really use some insight from an expert.

114
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:46,348
我不确定能当专家 不过很乐意帮助你
Well, I'm not sure I'm an expert, but I would be happy to help.

115
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:48,160
太棒了
Great.

116
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:52,596
嘿
Hey.

117
00:05:54,546 --> 00:05:56,931
达什的手没事吧?
How's Dash's hand?

118
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,086
我说你好
I said hello.

119
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:05,923
这里没有龙舌兰酒了 我想楼上会有
We're out of tequila. I think there's some more upstairs.

120
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:10,378
怎么 你就这样... 不跟我说话了吗?
So what, you're just... not gonna talk to me?

121
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,157
我说话了啊 我说这里没有龙舌兰酒了
I just did. I said we're out of tequila.

122
00:06:13,171 --> 00:06:16,471
你怎么能生我的气呢?
How can you be mad at me?

123
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:19,226
这些又不是我的错 我又没告诉达什我们的事
None of this is my fault. I didn't tell Dash what happened.

124
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:21,041
你能诚实地看着我并且告诉我
Can you honestly look me in the eye 

125
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,856
他发现之后你没觉得高兴吗?
and say you are not happy that he found out?

126
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:24,164
这就是你希望发生的事...
This is what you wanted to have happen...

127
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,400
不准...
Stop...

128
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:27,017
怪罪到我身上
Putting this on me.

129
00:06:27,018 --> 00:06:28,542
听着 我做了所有你要求我做的事
Look, I've done everything you asked.

130
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:30,430
你想做朋友 我们做朋友了 
You wanted to be friends, we're friends. 

131
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,172
你让我向前看 我向前看了
You told me to move on, I moved on.

132
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:35,349
别搞得好像我毁了你的生活一样
Stop treating me like I screwed up your life.

133
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,783
就是这样! 你就是毁了我的生活!
You did! You destroyed it!

134
00:06:39,303 --> 00:06:41,891
你以为我希望我哥哥恨我吗?
You think I want my brother to hate me?

135
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,339
你以为我希望你恨我吗?
You think I want you to hate me?

136
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,668
我不知道你想怎么样 
I don't know what you want. 

137
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:47,130
我想连你自己都不知道
I don't think you know what you want.

138
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:49,659
我觉得这一切对你来说都是个游戏 
I think this whole thing is a game to you, 

139
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,923
我再也不想参与了
and I am not doing it anymore.

140
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,600
嗨
Hi.

141
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,804
艾米...
Amy...

142
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:09,997
抱歉 我来看你工作原本是想给你个惊喜
Sorry, I thought I would surprise you at work.

143
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:12,170
好惊喜呢
Surprise.

144
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,369
也许我们不应该等到日落再把它埋了
Maybe we shouldn't wait until sundown to bury it.

145
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,129
也许我们本来就不应该埋它 
Maybe we shouldn't bury it at all. 

146
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,447
我觉得我们应该烧了它
I think we should just burn it.

147
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:41,336
要是我一个人处理掉这些你会觉得好受些吗?
Would you feel more comfortable if I took care of this without you?

148
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:43,711
不 如果它不存在我才会好受些
No, I'd feel more comfortable if it didn't exist.

149
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:47,540
你看见它是怎么对待我们父亲的
You saw what it did to our father.

150
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:50,596
它把他体内所有的东西都毁了
It killed everything good inside of him.

151
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:54,238
你不用盯着我看 我们不会销毁它的
We're not getting rid of it, so you can stop looking at me like that.

152
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:55,683
听着 乔安娜 
Listen, Joanna, 

153
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,909
我... 我理解你为什么保留着它
I... I understand why you kept it.

154
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:00,811
我真的理解
I do.

155
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:03,414
你以为要是你等得足够久 也许某一天
You thought if you waited long enough, that maybe someday

156
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:05,364
你就能利用它再见到弗雷德里克
you could use it so you could see Frederick again.

157
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:07,047
我不想谈弗雷德里克  
I don't want to talk about Frederick.  

158
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:08,729
你从来不想谈弗雷德里克
You never want to talk about him.

159
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,592
我知道你想他
I know that you miss him.

160
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:14,121
我不想谈论这些 我就不应该告诉你钥匙的事
I don't want to talk about it. I should never have told you about the key.

161
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,548
别管它了 我会处理好它的
So just leave it alone, and I'll take care of it.

162
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:46,208
温迪...
Wendy...

163
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:16,184
你干什么了?!
What did you do?!

164
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:18,396
它攻击我 快把它弄下来
It attacked me. Get it off right now.

165
00:09:18,431 --> 00:09:20,568
- 哎呦! - 我在弄呢 我不想弄伤你
- Ow, ow, ow! - I'm trying. I don't want to hurt you.

166
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:23,401
到底怎么回事! 你看它的眼睛了吗?
What the hell happened! Did you look in its eyes?

167
00:09:23,436 --> 00:09:25,928
你知道不该看它的眼睛的
You know you are not supposed to look in its eyes.

168
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:29,056
好了 我现在 实在是没心情听你说教
Okay, I am really, really not in the mood for one of your lectures right now.

169
00:09:29,074 --> 00:09:30,900
解除巨蛇
Dimitte serpens.

170
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:33,111
这条蛇是纯粹邪恶的载体
This snake is a powerful vessel of pure evil.

171
00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:35,167
我觉得我们需要一些更厉害的东西 
I think we need something a little stronger 

172
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:36,581
而不是即兴的拉丁咒语!
than off-the-cuff Latin commands!

173
00:09:36,615 --> 00:09:38,206
我们试试讽刺吧 应该有帮助
Let's try sarcasm; that should help.

174
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:39,701
我去拿魔书
Let me get the Grimoire.

175
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:41,135
乔安娜
Joanna.

176
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:43,120
看啊
Look.

177
00:09:44,874 --> 00:09:47,494
待着别动 我去把书拿来 我们会找到办法的
Stay right there. I'm getting the book. We'll figure this out.

178
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:48,770
快点
Hurry.

179
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:11,449
- 听着 基利安... - 天哪
- Look, Killian... - Oh, God.

180
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:15,470
"听着 基利安"后面从来没有好结果
No good conversation ever started with "Look, Killian..."

181
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:19,024
我喜欢你 真的 很喜欢
I really like you. I do. A lot.

182
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:23,163
我喜欢忧郁的男生 我对他们毫无抵抗力
I have a thing for lost souls. I'm... I'm a sucker for them.

183
00:10:23,197 --> 00:10:25,513
但是我觉得我不是那个能找到你灵魂的人
But I don't think I'm the one who can find you.

184
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:27,914
如果是因为弗雷娅 我可以告诉你...  
If this is because Freya, I told you...  

185
00:10:27,915 --> 00:10:28,635
你已经说过了
You did.

186
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:31,297
你说过你对她没感觉
You told me that you don't have feelings for her.

187
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:35,792
你可以对我撒谎 但你不能对自己撒谎
And you can lie to me if you want, but you should stop lying to yourself.

188
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:42,280
好运 基利安
Good luck, Killian.

189
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,454
你们还有什么书呢?
Okay, what else have you got?

190
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,788
- 不是吧 - 说来听听
- Come on. - Hit me.

191
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,403
这些你都看完了吗?  
You finished those already?  

192
00:10:58,404 --> 00:10:59,983
我看书做笔记都非常快的
I am an unbelievably fast note-taker.

193
00:10:59,984 --> 00:11:01,796
这算是我的天赋吧
It's... it's quite a skill.

194
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:04,696
我不知道我们这儿还有多少关于东区的历史书
I don't know how many more history books on East End that we have.

195
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:07,121
事实上我在找一些关于...
I'm actually looking for something more about...

196
00:11:07,122 --> 00:11:10,784
神灵 巫术 诅咒 幽灵一类的东西
The occult. Witchcraft, curses, spirits, that kind of thing.

197
00:11:10,785 --> 00:11:11,859
为什么?
Why?

198
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:13,555
我想你一定已经意识到了
Well, I'm sure you're already aware of this,

199
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,975
这个小镇的神话传说有很长的历史了
but this town has a long history of supernatural legends,

200
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,211
从早期的殖民者到焚烧女巫再到...
from the early settlers to the witch burnings on to...

201
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:22,052
费尔黑文阿奇博尔德・布朗宁和他的信徒
Archibald Browning and his cult at Fair Haven.

202
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:24,349
东区一直以东部海岸
You know, East End is also famous for being one

203
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,352
南瓜生长最好的小镇而出名
of the best pumpkin-growing towns on the Eastern Seaboard.

204
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:32,324
英格丽德写过一篇关于巫术的论文
Uh, Ingrid wrote her dissertation about witchcraft.

205
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,567
有意思 她... 没有跟我提过
Interesting. She didn't... mention it to me.

206
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,703
除非我很讨厌某人 否则我不会跟别人聊
It's not something I usually slip into conversation

207
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:37,992
这些事情的
unless I want to bore someone.

208
00:11:37,993 --> 00:11:39,744
- 她也会巫术 - 巴布 别说了
- She also does witchcraft. - Barb, stop.

209
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:41,688
- 不 巴布 接着说 - 我真是太傻了
- No, Barb, continue. - This is stupid.

210
00:11:41,697 --> 00:11:43,497
她让我怀孕了
She got me pregnant.

211
00:11:43,532 --> 00:11:45,802
不 这听起来不太对
Okay. No, that sounds wrong.

212
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:49,244
我意思是她念了一个怀孕的咒语我才怀孕的
I meant she did a fertility spell for me that made it possible.

213
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:51,372
那咒语是假的 是我在网上学的
It was a fake spell I got off the Internet

214
00:11:51,373 --> 00:11:52,990
说不定是一个十一岁的孩子写的
probably written by an 11-year-old boy.

215
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:54,925
跟你怀孕没任何关系
It had nothing to do with you getting pregnant.

216
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,493
根本没有巫术这回事
There's no such thing as witchcraft.

217
00:11:56,511 --> 00:11:58,262
好吧 你跟我肚子里这个
Well, tell that to this thing inside me

218
00:11:58,296 --> 00:12:00,831
每天早上让我呕吐的小家伙说吧
that makes me throw up every morning.

219
00:12:00,849 --> 00:12:02,932
她很搞笑
She's funny.

220
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:04,900
看起来我们有很多东西可以聊
Sounds like we have a lot more to talk about.

221
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:07,569
事实上 不行 我现在还有很多工作要做
Uh, actually, no. I got a lot of work to do right now.

222
00:12:07,604 --> 00:12:09,321
我哪儿也不去
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

223
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:12,457
- 好吧 - 那我们待会儿聊
- Okay. - So, we can talk later.

224
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,622
- 好的 - 好的
- Yes. - All right.

225
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:27,845
我刚刚看到艾米了 她去哪儿了?  
Didn't I just see Amy? Where is she? 

226
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:29,359
她走了 刚跟她分手了
She left. Just broke up with her.

227
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:30,789
什么? 为什么?
What? Why?

228
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,131
我想她要的是一段认真的恋爱 而我...
Well, I felt like she was interested in something serious and...

229
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,920
不够认真
I'm not.

230
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:38,864
你在做什么呀 基利安?
What are you doing, Killian?

231
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:41,236
- 什么意思? - 我是说 这儿
- What do you mean? - I mean, here.

232
00:12:41,237 --> 00:12:43,707
你的人生 你怎么还能在这儿呢?
With your life. Why are you even still here?

233
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,976
你怎么能在伤害了一个人之后还在这儿呢?
Why be here at all if you're just hurting people?

234
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:49,563
弗雷娅 我觉得你没有资格批评我
I don't think you're in a position to judge me, Freya.

235
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:55,935
弗雷娅・波尚在这儿吗?  
Is there a Freya Beauchamp here?  

236
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:57,105
是的 在那边
Yeah, just over there.

237
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,001
这是给你的
These are for you.

238
00:13:01,002 --> 00:13:03,453
- 在这儿签字 - 谢谢
- I just need you to sign. - Thanks.

239
00:13:06,865 --> 00:13:08,332
我的天...
Oh, my...

240
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,660
我的天呐 是达什送的
Oh, my God. They're from Dash.

241
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,708
你确定吗? 卡片上又没有名字
You sure about that? No name on the card.

242
00:13:17,742 --> 00:13:20,544
当然是达什送的 还能是谁呢?
Of course they're from Dash. Who else would they be from?

243
00:13:22,413 --> 00:13:24,859
天呐
Oh, my God.

244
00:13:30,806 --> 00:13:32,223
找到了
Got it.

245
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:34,225
温迪 别着急
Wendy, don't worry.

246
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:36,143
我有办法了
I have an idea.

247
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,566
温迪...?
Wendy...?

248
00:13:48,657 --> 00:13:50,457
基利安
Killian.

249
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:52,126
妈妈
Hey, Mom.

250
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:55,629
- 你可以走了吗? - 可以了 弗雷娅
- Are you ready to go? - Yeah, sure. Freya.

251
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:57,916
我现在要出去一下 一小时后回来
I'm going out on my break. Be back in an hour.

252
00:13:58,307 --> 00:14:00,467
佩内洛普 很高兴见到你
Penelope, it's so nice to see you.

253
00:14:00,502 --> 00:14:03,754
亲爱的 你还好吗?
Dear, are you all right?

254
00:14:03,788 --> 00:14:06,557
- 你看起来很糟糕 - 什么?
- You look terrible. - What?

255
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,625
- 说真的 你怎么啦? - 你说什么?
- Seriously, what's wrong? - What do you mean?

256
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:12,015
首先 你一直在... 发抖
Well, for one thing, you keep... swaying.

257
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,315
- 是吗? - 你看上去脸都青了
- Oh, I do? - You look positively green.

258
00:14:14,349 --> 00:14:16,433
跟我来 我带你回家
Come with me. I'm taking you home.

259
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:19,027
我... 我还没下班呢
Oh, I... My shift isn't over.

260
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:20,609
跟我走吧
I insist.

261
00:14:20,655 --> 00:14:22,239
我想基利安会替你一会儿的
I'm sure Killian can cover for you.

262
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,929
我们晚点再吃午饭吧
We'll have to take a rain check on our lunch.

263
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,897
好的 当然了 没问题
Yeah, of course. No problem.

264
00:14:26,355 --> 00:14:27,944
但是我还没有下班
But I can't leave work.

265
00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:29,530
你再待下去就要生病了
You can't stay here if you're getting sick.

266
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:30,981
赶紧走吧 亲爱的
Now come on, dear.

267
00:14:32,182 --> 00:14:35,744
我保证我会好好照顾你的
I promise to take very good care of you.

268
00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:44,661
- 你还好吧? - 是的
- You okay? - Yeah.

269
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:47,681
我找到一个可能有用的咒语
I found a spell that may work.

270
00:14:47,716 --> 00:14:50,684
需要的东西都有 但是我要... 准备一下
I have what we need but I'll need to... prepare.

271
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:53,804
如果我们做的对的话也许可以留下这把钥匙
I think we can save the key if we get it right.

272
00:14:53,838 --> 00:14:56,340
我觉得没这个必要
I don't think that'll be necessary.

273
00:14:56,506 --> 00:14:57,849
温迪...  
Wendy...  

274
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,344
这把钥匙可以解决我们的问题
This key is the answer to our problems.

275
00:15:00,345 --> 00:15:02,179
用它我们就可以回家了 
We can use it to go back home.  

276
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,180
温迪 停下来
Wendy, stop.

277
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:04,949
毒液正在控制你
The venom's getting to you.

278
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,708
我们刚刚谈过了 我们不能回去
We just talked about it. We can't go back.

279
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:08,135
或许现在已经安全了
Maybe it's safe by now.

280
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,880
看着我 那里永远都不会安全的 
Look at me. It'll never be safe. 

281
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:12,337
所以我还没用巨蛇
That's why I haven't used the serpent.

282
00:15:12,338 --> 00:15:14,245
也许你错了呢  
Maybe you're wrong. 

283
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,107
你知道我们不是自愿离开的
You know we didn't leave by choice.

284
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:20,774
父亲当权的时候把我们放逐到这个世界
Our father banished us to this world when he came into power.

285
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:21,974
- 但是... - 不!
- But... - No!

286
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:25,267
他说如果我们回去仙宫 他就会杀了我们
He said if we ever returned to Asgard, he will kill us.

287
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:27,128
也许他变了呢
But maybe he's changed.

288
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:30,154
- 他不会变的 - 你不知道
- He hasn't changed. - You don't know that.

289
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,585
我只剩一条命了 乔安娜 
I have one life left, Joanna, 

290
00:15:32,586 --> 00:15:34,935
我不想浪费在这儿 我想回家
and I don't want to spend it here. I want to go home.

291
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:38,815
- 你是永生的 你不懂 - 温迪 听我说
- You're immortal. You don't understand. - Wendy, please listen,

292
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:40,522
你现在要集中精力
I need you to focus.

293
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,974
- 如果我打开入口... - 不!
- If I could just get to the portal... - No!

294
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:45,426
绝对不能
Absolutely not.

295
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:47,122
如果打开入口 
If that portal opens, 

296
00:15:47,123 --> 00:15:50,464
我们不知道另一边会过来什么东西!
we have no idea what may come through from the other side!

297
00:15:52,903 --> 00:15:56,573
那条蛇正在诱惑你达到它的目的
The snake is seducing you to get what it wants.

298
00:15:56,574 --> 00:15:59,235
它的目的就是打开入口  
It only wants to open the portal.  

299
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:00,788
那也是我希望的
That's all I want.

300
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:03,070
我想回家 那儿比这里要好
I miss my home. It was better there.

301
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,975
我也想 温迪 但那已经不是以前的样子了
I miss it, too, Wendy, but it's not the same place anymore.

302
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:09,790
- 妈咪嘛咪哄! - 不!
- Claude ianuas! - No!

303
00:16:14,175 --> 00:16:16,096
乔安娜...!
Joanna...!

304
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:18,561
乔安娜!
Joanna!

305
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:21,575
妈咪嘛咪哄!
Aperite!

306
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,121
你这个贱人
You are such a bitch.

307
00:16:35,173 --> 00:16:37,658
成熟点吧 乔安娜
Grow up, Joanna.

308
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:41,474
你不能把我永远困在这儿
You can't keep me in here forever.

309
00:16:45,528 --> 00:16:49,020
我会解开咒语的 你知道我一定会的
I will break this spell eventually. You know I will.

310
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:56,193
这与你无关
This has nothing to do with you.

311
00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:02,041
我是在帮助你  
I'm trying to help you.  

312
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:04,368
想帮助我就让我走!
You can help me by letting me go!

313
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,026
我们一定得把这东西从你身上取下来
We have got to get this thing off of you.

314
00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:16,163
你在开玩笑吗?!
Are you kidding me?!

315
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:20,551
你一点都不关心我
You don't care about me.

316
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:23,829
你一百多年没有跟我说话
You didn't speak to me for over a hundred years.

317
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:27,208
你是个冷血的贱人
I guess you're a coldhearted bitch.

318
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:29,977
去问问弗雷德里克
Just ask Frederick.

319
00:17:30,011 --> 00:17:33,814
对了 你不能 因为你抛弃他了
Oh, that's right. You can't. Because you left him behind.

320
00:17:33,848 --> 00:17:35,482
你抛弃了你唯一的儿子
You abandoned your only son.

321
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:38,018
- 事情不是那样的 - 不是吗?
- That is not true. - It's not?

322
00:17:38,052 --> 00:17:39,820
你没有抛弃他吗?
You didn't abandon him?

323
00:17:39,854 --> 00:17:44,165
是他不跟我们走 你知道他背叛我了
He refused to come with us. You know that he was turned against me.

324
00:17:44,526 --> 00:17:46,994
你知道吗 对某些人来说...
You know, for somebody...

325
00:17:47,028 --> 00:17:49,830
说起来是养育
supposedly so nurturing,

326
00:17:49,864 --> 00:17:52,899
你所做的就只是毁掉别人
all you seem to do is destroy people.

327
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:55,902
这就是你不能谈起弗雷德里克的原因
That's why you can't talk about Frederick.

328
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,289
因为你无法改变你对他所做的事
Because you can't deal with what you did to him.

329
00:18:00,592 --> 00:18:04,928
或者你只是... 毫不关心
Or maybe you... just don't care.

330
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:09,098
你这话太伤人了... 温迪
It broke my heart, Wendy.

331
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:12,753
我没有一天不后悔把他留在那
There's not a day that goes by that I don't regret leaving him there.

332
00:18:12,771 --> 00:18:14,421
你觉得如果你告诉女孩们
What do you think the girls are gonna say

333
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:17,691
你撇下了她们的哥哥她们会怎么想?
when I tell them that you left their brother behind?

334
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:19,777
- 够了 - 那就对了
- Stop it. - Oh, that's right.

335
00:18:19,811 --> 00:18:21,562
其实也没什么关系 不是吗?
It doesn't really matter, does it?

336
00:18:21,596 --> 00:18:24,364
反正她们很快就会死掉
Because they're gonna die soon anyway.

337
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:27,568
一般都是这个时候 对吧 乔安娜?
It always happens around this time. Right, Joanna?

338
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:34,625
滴答 滴答
Ticktock. Ticktock.

339
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:37,544
- 滴答 - 够了
- Ticktock. - That's enough.

340
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:39,246
我刺激到某人了吗?
Did I strike a nerve?

341
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,611
解开束缚
Liber a vinculis.

342
00:18:50,091 --> 00:18:53,005
我感觉很糟糕 我怎么了?  
I feel worse. Wha's wrong with me?  

343
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,295
把这个茶喝了 会管用的
Drink this tea. It'll help.

344
00:18:55,773 --> 00:18:58,453
我的胳膊没有知觉了  
I can't feel my arms. 

345
00:18:58,454 --> 00:19:00,017
嗯 让我帮你吧
Oh, well, let me help.

346
00:19:04,189 --> 00:19:06,788
达什今天给我送花了  
Dash sent me flowers today. 

347
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:08,442
太好了 亲爱的
Oh, that's wonderful, dear.

348
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:12,112
- 那他一定是原谅你了 - 他是我的真爱
- That must mean he forgives you. - He's my soul mate.

349
00:19:12,463 --> 00:19:16,483
他当然是 再喝点
Of course he is. Have some more.

350
00:19:18,953 --> 00:19:21,590
我感觉好困
I just feel so sleepy.

351
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:24,174
我要躺一会
I'm gonna lay down.

352
00:19:24,714 --> 00:19:28,183
很好 你睡吧
Oh, that's good. You sleep.

353
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:54,812
酒精稀释...
Vinum attenuat...

354
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:57,772
...调剂
...Eam.

355
00:20:00,023 --> 00:20:01,991
嗨
Hey.

356
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:04,832
我很快就走 我保证
I'm leaving soon. I promise.

357
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:08,151
只是... 这比我旅馆的房间好多了
It's just... it's so much nicer here than my hotel room.

358
00:20:08,152 --> 00:20:11,664
慢慢来 我又发现一本书可能会有用
Take your time. I found one more that might be useful.

359
00:20:11,689 --> 00:20:13,004
太好了
Great.

360
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,544
我没告诉你我的论文
I did not tell you about my dissertation,

361
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:20,046
你也没告诉我你是一个出版作家
but you didn't tell me you're a published author.

362
00:20:20,064 --> 00:20:22,399
想不到真有图书馆会收藏这本书
I can't believe there's a library that actually stocks this.

363
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:24,370
它不怎么畅销
It wasn't exactly a bestseller.

364
00:20:24,371 --> 00:20:27,387
是啊 我们有呢 而且我希望你能帮我签名
Well, we have it, and I would like for you to sign it for me.

365
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:31,249
图书馆不是有规定不能在书上写字吗?
Isn't there some kind of rule about writing in library books?

366
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,994
如果你不说的话 我也不会说出去的
I won't tell, if you don't.

367
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:37,898
谢谢 那么 这是关于什么的?
Thank you. So, what's it about?

368
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,319
我不想剧透 你还是自己看吧
I don't want to spoil it for you, so you'll just have to read it yourself.

369
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,886
好吧
Deal.

370
00:20:44,873 --> 00:20:47,968
谢谢 英格丽德 谢谢你的帮助
Thank you, Ingrid, for all of your help.

371
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:50,744
没你的帮忙这需要很久的
This would be taking so much longer without you.

372
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:53,357
即使对极速读者来说也是吗?  
Even for Super Speed Reader Guy?  

373
00:20:53,358 --> 00:20:54,915
是的 对他也是一样
Yes, even for him.

374
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:57,135
那么 你有我的书了 
So, you have my book. 

375
00:20:57,136 --> 00:20:58,917
我什么时候能看看你的论文?
When do I get to read your dissertation?

376
00:20:58,918 --> 00:21:03,468
不 不可能 我... 我写不完了
Oh, no. That is not happening. I... I never even finished it.

377
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:04,761
为什么?
Why not?

378
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:10,126
我... 我觉得对魔法的学术研究太荒谬了
I... I realized that an academic study of witchcraft was kind of ridiculous.

379
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:13,162
这么说你不相信神喽
Ah, so you don't believe in the supernatural.

380
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:15,235
不相信
No.

381
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:18,238
我一直是个科学怀疑论者
Mm-mm. I'm a rational skeptic, all the way.

382
00:21:18,272 --> 00:21:21,686
那样的话 等我完成了
In that case, you probably shouldn't read the book I'm working on.

383
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:23,543
- 你也不该读我的作品 - 为什么不呢?
- If I ever finish it. - Why not?

384
00:21:23,578 --> 00:21:25,445
我喜欢读科幻小说啊
I like science fiction and fantasy.

385
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:27,870
- 这不是幻想 - 真的吗?
- It's not fantasy. - Really?

386
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,839
这是关于女巫的 而且...
It is about witches, but...

387
00:21:30,084 --> 00:21:32,502
我相信女巫是存在的
I believe witches are real.

388
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:52,522
有意思
Funny.

389
00:21:53,858 --> 00:21:56,046
你在哪 温迪?
Where are you, Wendy?

390
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:58,653
你不能去那个入口
You are not going into that portal.

391
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,242
不!
No!

392
00:22:40,084 --> 00:22:42,956
怎么 你打算杀了我吗? 这是你的计划吗?
So, what, are you gonna kill me? Is that the plan?

393
00:22:42,991 --> 00:22:45,959
有必要的话我会的... 除非你先杀了我
If I have to... Unless you kill me first.

394
00:22:45,994 --> 00:22:47,661
你忘了 我是永生的
You forget, I'm immortal.

395
00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:50,130
我现在知道怎么杀你了
But now I know what'll kill you.

396
00:22:50,164 --> 00:22:52,857
这个东西给了我很多好主意
This is giving me all kinds of good ideas.

397
00:22:52,858 --> 00:22:54,692
那个东西在影响你
That thing's infecting you.

398
00:22:54,702 --> 00:22:56,641
你不能相信它告诉你的
You can't believe what it's telling you.

399
00:22:56,715 --> 00:22:58,248
不 它开阔了我的眼界
No, it's opened my eyes.

400
00:22:58,266 --> 00:23:00,584
现在我知道你是一个恶魔 乔安娜
I now see that you're the evil one, Joanna.

401
00:23:00,602 --> 00:23:02,753
难怪你丈夫离你而去
No wonder your husband left you.

402
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:06,390
唯一一个你真心爱过的男人
The only man that you ever really truly loved.

403
00:23:06,424 --> 00:23:08,609
你一样毁了他!
And you destroyed him as well!

404
00:23:08,643 --> 00:23:10,527
别把他扯进来 温迪
Leave him out of this, Wendy.

405
00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:14,031
姑娘们也不知道那些 对吧?
The girls don't know about that one, either, do they?

406
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:16,695
你怎么和她们说她们的父亲的?
What have you told them about their father?

407
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,866
她们有权利知道她们的父亲还活着 
Don't they have a right to know that he's alive 

408
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:19,951
并且近在眼前吧?
and so close by?

409
00:23:19,988 --> 00:23:21,872
他很久之前就离开了
He left a long time ago.

410
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,376
他知道我们在哪 他选择了离开
He knows where we are. He chooses to stay away.

411
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,127
我好奇他为什么选择离开
I wonder why he chooses to stay away.

412
00:23:27,162 --> 00:23:29,246
是因为他无法忍受你了吗?
Is it because he can't stand the sight of you?

413
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,582
如果是的话 我可以理解
Because that one, I can understand.

414
00:23:31,616 --> 00:23:36,053
还是他无法原谅你抛下了弗雷德里克
Or is it that he can't forgive you for leaving Frederick behind.

415
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:39,089
还是因为他无法忍受...
Or is it losing the girls...

416
00:23:39,123 --> 00:23:43,060
不断地不断地失去女儿们
Over and over and over again,

417
00:23:43,094 --> 00:23:46,291
而且因为你的错误她们才被诅咒的?
because it's your fault that they're cursed?

418
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,484
够了!
Stop!

419
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,444
我知道这听起来...
I understand how it sounds...

420
00:23:54,478 --> 00:23:55,530
我过去也是个无神论者... 
I used to be a skeptic, too... 

421
00:23:55,531 --> 00:23:56,357
但是我看到了证据...
but I've seen evidence...

422
00:23:56,358 --> 00:23:58,040
我见过令人信服的证据...  
I've seen convincing evidence...  

423
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:58,826
证据可能是假的
Evidence can be faked.

424
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:00,949
真的有巫师的 英格丽德 
There are real witches, Ingrid, 

425
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,249
活在我们中间 很好的隐藏着
living among us, hiding right in plain sight.

426
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,654
我相信他们很久以前从另一个世界来到这里
I believe they came here a very long time ago from a different world.

427
00:24:06,688 --> 00:24:09,723
- 仙宫 - 仙宫? 那是神话里的
- Asgard. - Asgard? This place is a myth.

428
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:10,887
我认为它是真的 
I think it's real, 

429
00:24:10,888 --> 00:24:12,893
而且我认为它是和这个镇连着的
and I think it's actually connected to this very town.

430
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:15,029
所以你觉得有另一个世界
So you believe there's this other world

431
00:24:15,063 --> 00:24:17,832
那里会魔法的人能够来到这里
of magical people who can find their way here.

432
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:21,180
你用这种语气说出来 的确听起来很疯狂
Well, when you say it in that tone of voice, of course it sounds crazy.

433
00:24:21,181 --> 00:24:24,394
对不起 我只是 只是一时很难相信
I'm sorry, it's just, it's hard to wrap your head around it.

434
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:26,413
听着 我没有说这个地方一定存在
Look, I'm not saying it's definitely real.

435
00:24:26,414 --> 00:24:27,831
我只是...
I just...

436
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:29,800
希望它存在
Hope it is.

437
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,412
我父亲整个成年时代都在找这个地方
My father spent his entire adult life looking for it.

438
00:24:32,413 --> 00:24:36,193
- 他也是作家吗? - 不 是个考古学家
- Was he a writer, too? - No. An archaeologist.

439
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:38,579
他... 专心于证实
He was... obsessed with proving 

440
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,439
这个神奇的地方的真实存在
that this mythical world was a real place.

441
00:24:41,473 --> 00:24:43,924
当然 人们都认为他疯了
Of course, people thought he was insane.

442
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:47,778
而最后果真那样了... 他确实疯了
And eventually it came true... He did lose his mind.

443
00:24:48,328 --> 00:24:49,973
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

444
00:24:49,974 --> 00:24:52,725
没事 没关系 几年前他去世了
No. It's okay. He died a couple years ago,

445
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:56,237
但是在他去世之前 他给我看了他的成果
but before he went, he shared his work with me,

446
00:24:56,238 --> 00:25:01,150
恐怖的是 那些都讲得通
and... the scary thing is, it all makes sense.

447
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,112
我必须证明我的父亲没有疯
I have to prove my father wasn't crazy.

448
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,797
我一直研究他的成果
I've been going through his work,

449
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:08,905
把所有的东西汇总 联系起来
putting together the pieces, connecting the dots,

450
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:11,674
而后我发现了去仙宫的门
and what I think I've discovered the door to Asgard

451
00:25:11,675 --> 00:25:14,421
就在这里 就在东区
is here, in East End.

452
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:20,252
妈咪嘛咪哄
Potionem... hanc...

453
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:21,554
妈咪嘛咪哄
tollam...

454
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:23,246
妈咪嘛咪哄
viribus...

455
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,114
妈咪嘛咪哄
tuis.

456
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,070
妈咪嘛咪哄
Dona mihi...

457
00:25:33,105 --> 00:25:34,940
妈咪嘛咪哄
...ero.

458
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:47,252
你真的要惹恼我了 温迪
You're starting to really piss me off, Wendy.

459
00:25:47,286 --> 00:25:49,454
马上结束吧!
This ends right now!

460
00:25:49,472 --> 00:25:53,225
会的... 但不是你希望的那样
Oh, it will... But not the way you hope.

461
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:56,327
你一直拿着这把钥匙!
You had this key the whole time!

462
00:25:56,346 --> 00:26:00,775
我们没必要困在这 这个困扰我们的地方
We didn't have to be stuck here, where we're persecuted,

463
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:02,976
这个需要隐藏我们本质的地方
where we have to hide our true nature.

464
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:05,062
你为什么不想回去?!
Why don't you want to go back?!

465
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,567
因为我们在这比那更安全  
Because we're safer here than there.  

466
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:08,899
不会持续太久的
Not for long.

467
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:10,491
妈咪嘛咪哄!
Axicia volant!

468
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:15,163
反应很快嘛 亲爱的
Ooh, nice reflexes, babe.

469
00:26:15,164 --> 00:26:18,677
你带那个东西过久 你就不再是你了
You keep that thing on much longer, you'll never be yourself again.

470
00:26:18,993 --> 00:26:22,162
这么久毒素已经深入你的血液了
It's been pumping poison into your veins this whole time.

471
00:26:22,188 --> 00:26:23,978
那你必须毁了它才能从我身上取下来
Then you'll have to destroy it to get it off me,

472
00:26:23,979 --> 00:26:26,806
我知道为了弗雷德里克你不会的
and I know that you can't because of Frederick.

473
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:29,936
我猜你很为难 对吗?
So I guess you're in a bit of a pickle, aren't you?

474
00:26:29,937 --> 00:26:33,786
- 温迪... 别这样 - 妈咪嘛咪哄!
- Wendy... come on. - Omnia telavolant!

475
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:49,439
妈咪嘛咪哄
Axicia...

476
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,970
妈咪嘛咪哄
interficiam serpens.

477
00:26:57,769 --> 00:27:01,706
我父亲在秘鲁挖出来的这个
My father found this on a dig in Peru.

478
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,242
他相信这个...
He believed that this...

479
00:27:04,276 --> 00:27:07,082
是去仙宫的地图
was a map to Asgard.

480
00:27:07,496 --> 00:27:10,715
你看 它已经退色了
As you can see, though, it's very faded.

481
00:27:11,142 --> 00:27:13,672
这是个很有意思的符号
That is an interesting symbol.

482
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:17,203
- 他认为那个是什么意思? - 他不知道
- What did he think that meant? - Uh, he didn't know.

483
00:27:17,204 --> 00:27:19,214
他相信这个和巫术有关 
He thought it had something to do with witchcraft, 

484
00:27:19,215 --> 00:27:21,225
但是... 他没能破解
but... he couldn't crack it.

485
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,294
我也没弄明白 但是...
I haven't figured it out, either, but...

486
00:27:23,312 --> 00:27:25,263
这不会妨碍我接着尝试
that's not gonna stop me from trying.

487
00:27:45,617 --> 00:27:48,669
嗨? 有人在家吗?
Hello? Anybody home?

488
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:52,518
妈妈 你在吗?
Mom, are you here?

489
00:27:53,825 --> 00:27:56,866
- 怎么了? - 快点! 拿你的医药箱!
- What's going on? - Hurry! Get your medical bag!

490
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:02,708
看来为了这本书你的确找了很多材料
Well, it sure seems like you have a lot of material for this book of yours.

491
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:03,818
我知道
I know.

492
00:28:03,827 --> 00:28:05,944
我也许该继续
I should probably get going.

493
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:08,213
我还有一本书要看
There's just one more book I need to look at.

494
00:28:08,214 --> 00:28:10,106
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

495
00:28:18,648 --> 00:28:20,649
妈咪嘛咪哄
Ostende te.

496
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:31,994
妈咪嘛咪哄
Absconde Te.

497
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:33,923
- 看到什么有趣的东西了吗? - 没有
- See anything interesting on there? - No.

498
00:28:33,924 --> 00:28:37,045
这个... 你说得对 这个太旧了
It, uh... I think you're right, it's just too worn out.

499
00:28:37,046 --> 00:28:38,246
是啊
Yeah.

500
00:28:41,481 --> 00:28:43,203
她怎么了?
What's wrong with her?

501
00:28:43,204 --> 00:28:44,222
我基本感觉不到心跳 
I can barely feel the pulse. 

502
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,343
这里到底发生什么事了?
What the hell happened here?

503
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:47,059
我... 我不知道 
I... I don't know. 

504
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,460
我们当时在喝茶 她突然就倒了
We were having tea, and she just suddenly collapsed.

505
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,128
- 多久了? - 我不知道
- How long ago? - I don't know,

506
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,752
只是... 你来之前一两分钟 
just... one or two minutes before you got here. 

507
00:28:53,753 --> 00:28:55,152
我该打911吗?
Should I call 911?

508
00:28:55,153 --> 00:28:57,483
她过敏了 她的血压在降低
She's in anaphylaxis. Her blood pressure's dropping.

509
00:28:57,484 --> 00:29:00,566
她呼吸困难 我都能听到她喉咙闭合的声音
Her breathing's labored. I can practically hear her throat closing up.

510
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:02,067
你要干什么?
What are you going to do?

511
00:29:02,068 --> 00:29:04,745
她需要一针肾上腺素 马上
She needs a shot of epinephrine, now.

512
00:29:10,903 --> 00:29:13,702
妈咪嘛咪哄! 妈咪嘛咪哄!
Aperio! Aperio!

513
00:29:13,703 --> 00:29:14,903
温迪?
Wendy?

514
00:29:14,904 --> 00:29:16,104
妈咪嘛咪哄!
Aperio!

515
00:29:16,105 --> 00:29:18,573
- 你出不去的 - 等着瞧吧
- You'll never get out. - Watch me.

516
00:29:23,808 --> 00:29:25,914
看 现在你也被困住了
So, now you're trapped, too.

517
00:29:25,915 --> 00:29:28,062
- 放开我 - 让我走 我就放开你
- Let me go. - Let me go, and I will.

518
00:29:28,063 --> 00:29:31,115
不 我不能这么做
No. I can't do that.

519
00:29:35,486 --> 00:29:37,643
好了 你血压正常了 太好了
Well, your blood pressure's normal, so that's good.

520
00:29:37,644 --> 00:29:39,194
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

521
00:29:39,763 --> 00:29:41,230
你今天吃什么了?
What did you eat today?

522
00:29:41,264 --> 00:29:43,365
我是说 你觉得是什么原因造成的?
I mean, what do you think could've caused this?

523
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:46,068
我不知道 只是... 感觉好模糊
I don't know. It's just... it's all so foggy.

524
00:29:46,102 --> 00:29:48,237
很高兴你及时出现了
I'm just glad you got here when you did.

525
00:29:48,271 --> 00:29:50,494
是啊 我们还是应该把你送到医院 以防万一
Yeah, we should probably get you to the hospital, though, just to be safe.

526
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,125
不用 不 我没事了 真的
No, no, no, no. I'm okay. Really.

527
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,961
有需要的话尽管告诉我 好吗?
You let me know if you need anything, all right?

528
00:30:04,254 --> 00:30:07,422
你怎么这么快就从伦敦回来了?
So, how did you get back from London so fast?

529
00:30:07,456 --> 00:30:09,341
我没去参加会议
I didn't go to the conference.

530
00:30:10,677 --> 00:30:12,227
我坐飞机到伦敦
I flew to London,

531
00:30:12,262 --> 00:30:15,521
我下了飞机然后...
I got off the plane and...

532
00:30:15,536 --> 00:30:17,599
我真的做不到
I just couldn't do it.

533
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:19,234
做不到什么?
Couldn't do what?

534
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:21,745
我做不到没处理好我们之间的事情 
I couldn't sit through all those seminars 

535
00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:23,138
就坐在那里参加会议
knowing things weren't settled with us.

536
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:26,997
我做不到... 明知道我们之间还闹着矛盾
I couldn't have this... an ocean between us 

537
00:30:26,998 --> 00:30:28,150
却离你这么远
knowing things weren't okay.

538
00:30:29,023 --> 00:30:33,693
所以我转身往回走了
So I turned around and I came right back.

539
00:30:35,298 --> 00:30:38,170
我回来是想告诉你 在你做了这些之后
I came back to tell you that I can't marry you.

540
00:30:38,818 --> 00:30:40,686
我不能再娶你了
Not after what you did.

541
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:46,612
好吧
Okay.

542
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,798
然后我看见你...
And then I saw you...

543
00:30:50,912 --> 00:30:52,801
快要死了...
About to die...

544
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:59,170
我意识到我不想生活在一个没有你的世界里
And I realized that I don't want to live in a world where you don't exist.

545
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,405
这种想法让我无法承受
The thought is unbearable.

546
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,815
我也无法承受
It's unbearable to me, too.

547
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:11,492
我觉得我失去你就像毁了我的一生
I thought I lost you and it was like my life was destroyed.

548
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,956
我再也不会伤害你了 我发誓
I will never hurt you again. I promise.

549
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,299
还是发誓不要再这么吓我了吧
Just promise you'll never scare me like that again either.

550
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,751
我发誓
I promise.

551
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:23,882
我爱你 弗雷娅
I love you, Freya.

552
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,991
- 永远爱你 - 我也爱你
- Always. - I love you, too.

553
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,485
谢谢你为我开门到这么晚
Thank you for keeping this place open so late for me.

554
00:31:38,486 --> 00:31:42,302
没什么 就看做是我反叛的行为吧
No problem. This is what counts as rebellious for me.

555
00:31:43,722 --> 00:31:45,589
嘿 希望我那一番有关神秘都市
Hey, I hope I didn't freak you out

556
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:50,444
神秘入口和女巫的事 没有吓坏你
with all that talk of mythical cities, and magical portals and witches.

557
00:31:50,478 --> 00:31:52,694
我发誓我不像起初看上去那么疯狂
I swear I'm not as crazy as I seem at first.

558
00:31:52,695 --> 00:31:54,213
不 我没觉得你疯狂
No, I don't think you're crazy.

559
00:31:54,214 --> 00:31:56,933
我只是觉得我们有不同的爱好
I just think we have different interests.

560
00:31:56,934 --> 00:32:00,270
有关女巫的事我已经放下很长时间了
I left all that witch stuff behind a long time ago,

561
00:32:00,288 --> 00:32:03,607
不知道还能帮你多少
so, I don't know how much more help I can be to you.

562
00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:05,582
好
Okay.

563
00:32:06,244 --> 00:32:09,639
英格丽德 你没生什么气 对吧?
Ingrid, you're not angry about something, are you?

564
00:32:09,686 --> 00:32:11,399
我很抱歉要是说了什么...
'Cause I'm sorry if I said something...

565
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,256
不 没有 我只是有点累了 都这么晚了
No, not at all. I think I'm just tired. Long night.

566
00:32:16,337 --> 00:32:18,922
懂了 我欠你个人情
I get it, and I owe you one.

567
00:32:18,956 --> 00:32:21,444
要是你决定完成你的论文 
If you decide to finish your dissertation, 

568
00:32:21,445 --> 00:32:23,310
我会很高兴帮助你的
I'd be more than happy to help.

569
00:32:23,755 --> 00:32:27,482
- 晚安 - 晚安
- Good night. - Night.

570
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:50,280
你知道 只要你打开这扇门 
You know, all you have to do is open the door, 

571
00:32:50,281 --> 00:32:51,700
所有的一切就都结束了
and this will all be over.

572
00:32:51,701 --> 00:32:53,626
让我走自己的路吧
Just let me go on my way.

573
00:32:54,248 --> 00:32:55,943
你再也不必见到我了 
You never have to see me again. 

574
00:32:55,944 --> 00:32:57,131
我不会这么做的
I won't do it.

575
00:32:58,033 --> 00:33:01,192
好的 那我就会勒住你
Okay. Then I'll strangle you

576
00:33:01,193 --> 00:33:03,077
直到你昏过去
until you pass out

577
00:33:03,078 --> 00:33:07,133
然后我会带你穿过入口把你作为贡品献出去
and I'll take you through the portal and I'll offer you as a sacrifice.

578
00:33:08,971 --> 00:33:11,907
你会死去 而我会活下来
You'll die, I'll live.

579
00:33:11,941 --> 00:33:15,327
这把钥匙让我如此有力量
Oh, this key is giving me so much more strength.

580
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:17,579
我好喜欢
I like it.

581
00:33:17,613 --> 00:33:21,249
这应该不需要很久的
This shouldn't take much time.

582
00:33:21,284 --> 00:33:23,144
妈咪嘛咪哄
Ianua.

583
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:28,924
不要...!
No...!

584
00:33:31,018 --> 00:33:32,228
乔安娜!
Joanna!

585
00:33:33,454 --> 00:33:34,871
妈咪嘛咪哄
Dissolvere.

586
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,692
你没事了
You're okay.

587
00:34:06,996 --> 00:34:09,798
这应该就能止血了
This should stop the bleeding.

588
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:15,554
我会... 我稍后会帮你疗伤
And I'll... I'll heal you later.

589
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:22,877
我... 我还要花点时间
I just... I'm just going to take a minute.

590
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:38,373
你住手吧 我没事的  
Will you stop it. I'm fine.  

591
00:34:38,374 --> 00:34:40,611
请让我继续我的工作
Let me do my job. Please.

592
00:34:42,156 --> 00:34:43,362
好的
All right.

593
00:34:43,363 --> 00:34:46,985
我想明天带你去医院 做些血液检查
I want to get you to the hospital tomorrow, run some blood tests.

594
00:34:47,226 --> 00:34:48,988
是的 医生
Yes, Doctor.

595
00:34:49,203 --> 00:34:50,875
我没开玩笑
I'm not kidding.

596
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:52,538
我知道
I know.

597
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:55,341
听着 今晚发生的事很严重
Look, what happened tonight was serious.

598
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:58,134
你知道 我差点失去你
You know, I almost lost you.

599
00:34:59,638 --> 00:35:01,681
你相信命运吗?
Do you believe in fate?

600
00:35:02,545 --> 00:35:04,247
不怎么信
Not really.

601
00:35:04,442 --> 00:35:06,385
好吧 我信
Well, I do.

602
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:10,258
我觉得有些事是命中注定的
I believe certain things are written in the stars.

603
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:12,110
就像我们
Like us.

604
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:15,096
我们是注定要在一起的
We're meant to be.

605
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:18,125
我等不及要娶你了
I can't wait to call you my wife.

606
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:29,122
不过你得休息一下 我去洗个澡
But you need to get some rest. I'm gonna take a shower.

607
00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:39,623
嘿 我来生火 好吗?
Hey, I'm gonna start a fire, okay?

608
00:35:39,657 --> 00:35:43,176
用壁炉旁边的火柴
Use the matches next to the fireplace.

609
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:45,958
妈咪嘛咪哄!
Luce, igni!

610
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:56,635
火柴向我走来
Uh... matches come toward me.

611
00:36:02,063 --> 00:36:05,565
妈咪嘛咪哄
eniat ad me arca archa.

612
00:36:08,536 --> 00:36:10,821
这是怎么...?
What is...?

613
00:36:10,855 --> 00:36:12,706
什...?
Wh...?

614
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,576
我为我做的事感到抱歉
I'm so sorry for everything I said.

615
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:52,258
这不是你的错... 是那条蛇
It wasn't your fault... it was the snake.

616
00:36:52,613 --> 00:36:54,998
对 不过是因为我的原因
Yeah, but because of me,

617
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:58,818
你毁了能见到儿子的唯一机会
you destroyed your only chance to ever see your son again.

618
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:03,410
要不然你可能就会永远变成一只怪物
It was either that or let you be a monster forever.

619
00:37:11,466 --> 00:37:14,879
要是你恨我的话我也理解
I understand if you hate me.

620
00:37:15,553 --> 00:37:18,251
这不是你的错
It wasn't your fault.

621
00:37:18,439 --> 00:37:22,859
你说得对 我本应该很早以前就毁掉那把钥匙
You were right, I should have destroyed the key a long time ago.

622
00:37:22,894 --> 00:37:26,063
我只是... 我只是还抱有希望
I was just... I was just holding onto the hope

623
00:37:26,097 --> 00:37:29,721
有一天我可能还会见到我儿子
that I might see my son again someday.

624
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:33,453
不过这不是真的 这...
But it wasn't real. It was...

625
00:37:33,454 --> 00:37:36,272
这只是一个愿望...
It was just a hope and...

626
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:41,661
我不想承认这个事实...
I mean, I hate to admit it...

627
00:37:44,132 --> 00:37:47,039
...他真的已经走了
...He really is gone.

628
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:50,269
他已经走了
He's gone.

629
00:37:57,253 --> 00:38:01,317
我不停地想起他 我好想他
I think about him all the time. I miss him so much.

630
00:38:03,476 --> 00:38:05,477
我也是
So do I.

631
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:12,560
对不起
I'm sorry.

632
00:38:17,815 --> 00:38:20,000
嘿
Hey.

633
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:22,986
这里到底怎么了?
What the hell happened in here?

634
00:38:22,987 --> 00:38:26,082
- 没什么 - 说来话长
- It's nothing. - Long story.

635
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:28,716
你呢? 今天过得怎么样?
What about you? How was your day?

636
00:38:28,747 --> 00:38:30,915
很奇怪
Strange.

637
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,351
真的有个叫仙宫的地方吗?
Is there a real place called Asgard?

638
00:38:33,385 --> 00:38:36,354
我要吐了
I'm gonna throw up.

639
00:38:36,388 --> 00:38:38,589
天哪 这是真的
Oh, my God, it's true.

640
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,895
那就是我们的故乡?
And that's where we came from?

641
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,491
- 谁告诉你...? - 你怎么...?
- Who told you...? - How did you...?

642
00:38:43,515 --> 00:38:45,465
图书馆有个男孩 是个作家
This guy at the library, a writer.

643
00:38:45,466 --> 00:38:48,536
他不是我们的同类 不过他试图找到...
He's not one of us, but he's tryin' to find the door...

644
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:51,993
去仙宫的那扇门 他确定那扇门就在东区
To Asgard. He's convinced it's in East End.

645
00:38:52,517 --> 00:38:54,517
太棒了
Great.

646
00:38:56,002 --> 00:39:00,008
好吧 那扇门被锁住了
Well, that door is locked.

647
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,988
永久地锁住了 再也没有人出入
Forever. No one's going in or out.

648
00:39:04,013 --> 00:39:08,314
总会有一些人试图证明神话是真实存在的
There've always been mortals trying to prove the myths are real.

649
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,870
别理他
Don't even humor him.

650
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:16,126
如果我是你 我会尽可能的躲着他
I'd just stay away from him as much as possible, if I were you.

651
00:39:17,408 --> 00:39:19,408
好 我会的
Yeah, I will.

652
00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:26,141
- 嘿 - 嘿 亲爱的...
- Hey. - Hey, sweetheart...

653
00:39:26,142 --> 00:39:27,384
- 嘿... - 嘿
- Hey... - Hey.

654
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:30,821
那... 达什回来了一切都正常了
So... Dash is back and everything seems to be okay.

655
00:39:30,846 --> 00:39:32,846
- 好诶... - 这太棒了!
- Good... - That's great!

656
00:39:33,855 --> 00:39:35,855
我的能量丧失了
My powers are gone.

657
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:39,386
什么...?
What...?

658
00:39:55,064 --> 00:39:57,064
谢谢你 弗雷娅...
Thank you, Freya...
