1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,430
要是Mickey Mantle(洋基队球员)的击球和这水压一样猛
If Mickey Mantle had this much water pressure,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,160
他绝对能在Maris跟前打出60个本垒打
he'd have hit 60 before Maris.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,260
干完这个 你居然就只知道说棒球和水管?
After that, all you can talk about is baseball and plumbing?

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,060
唔 是啊
Mm. Oh.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,100
哦 这场比赛有延长局
Oh, this game's going extra innings.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,700
你觉得你能本垒打?
You think you can knock it out of the park?

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,200
- 我肯定行  - 真的?
- Oh, I know I can.  - Oh, yeah?

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,260
绝对
Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,630
你还好吧?
You okay?

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,160
真诡异 我打了个寒颤
Yeah, that was weird. I just got a chill.

11
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,800
你打流感疫苗了没? 这几天感冒流行
Did you get your flu shot? There's a bug going around.

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,800
我自从1996年来就没生过病了
I haven't been sick since 1996.

13
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,630
快点 我准备好上场了 
Now, come on, I'm up to bat,

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,900
- 而你...  - 你火烫火烫的
- and you...  - You feel hot.

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,160
你也很火辣哟
You look hot.

16
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,600
好了 比赛下雨延期了
Well, this game's rained out.

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,430
- 我给你量个体温  - 哦 亲爱的
- I'm taking your temperature.  - Oh, honey.

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,360
别 拜托 我们可以继续的
No, please, come on. We can play through this.

19
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,730
好吗? 来 击球手入场
All right? Come on, batter up.

20
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,630
嘴张开
Open up.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,660
蜂群崩溃综合症 Neal
Colony collapse, Neal.

22
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,000
这就是我们需要解决的
That's what we're dealing with here.

23
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,260
数量惊人的意蜂
Apis mellifera are dying off

24
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,600
正在逐渐死亡
in terrifying proportions.

25
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,400
就在Timmy Nolan公园
Timmy Nolan Park.

26
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,130
人们连近地物体都能监测了
People for the awareness of near earth objects,

27
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,760
居然还要解决蜜蜂危机
and now the plight of the honeybees.

28
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,130
全国的农业都得靠这些嗡嗡的小东西
Our nation's agriculture depends on these drones.

29
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,430
没有它们授粉 就没有草莓
Without pollination, there's no strawberries,

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,960
- 没有杏仁...  - 没有葡萄?
- no almonds...  - No grapes?

31
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,800
是关于葡萄酒吧?
Is this about wine?

32
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,660
也许吧 你这里够放下三个蜂箱
Maybe. You have room for three hives.

33
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,000
而我一个都不想放到阳台上
That's three more beehives than I want on my terrace.

34
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,800
我说 养蜂在纽约到底合法吗?
I mean, is beekeeping even legal in New York?

35
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,560
五个行政区都允许
Across all five boroughs.

36
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,060
能有什么危险?
I mean, where's the danger?

37
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,900
让人想到杀人蜂
Swarms spring to mind.

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,060
不过蜂巢对于走私来说
Although a hive would be a decent hiding spot

39
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,230
是个藏东西的好地方
for contraband.

40
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,230
也是个极好的商机
And an excellent business opportunity.

41
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,530
花粉 蜂胶 还有蜂蜜
Pollen, propolis, and honey

42
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,730
自从古希腊时期以来 就因为医疗功效
have been known for their healing properties

43
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,960
而广为人知
since ancient greece.

44
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,360
克里奥佩特拉(埃及艳后)用牛奶
And Cleopatra bathed

45
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,030
和蜂蜜洗澡 至于我
in milk and honey, and, take it from me,

46
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,700
它们对我的...
what it did for my undercarriage...

47
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,700
行了 先装一个蜂箱
Okay. Start with one hive.

48
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,460
回头见
See you later.

49
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,060
说不定只是过敏
Probably just allergies.

50
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,400
到处都是树上掉的花粉
All those trees dropping pollen everywhere.

51
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,560
我就是喜欢这里的大量树木
I do love how leafy this neighborhood is.

52
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,960
Neal在这里做什么?
What is Neal doing here?

53
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,000
他到底有没有在你身上装定位器呀?
Does he have a tracker on you?

54
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,260
我告诉他我送你去上班
Told him I was walking you to work.

55
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,330
- 早上好 Peter  - 早上好
- Morning, Peter.  - Morning.

56
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,900
早上好 Elizabeth
Elizabeth. Morning.

57
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,030
要我帮你拿吗?
Want me to carry that for you?

58
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,060
- 你在打她的画的主意  - 什么?
- You're casing her art.  - What?

59
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,200
你在打我画的主意?
You're casing my art?

60
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,030
拜托 你们俩有权使用
Please. You guys qualify

61
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,730
- Neal牌家庭亲友套餐  - 我不知道你在说什么
- for the friends and family plan.  - I don't know what that means.

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,500
说到家庭...
Speaking of families...

63
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,200
哦 是啊 这个太离奇了
Oh, yeah, that's unbelievable.

64
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,800
本以为自己孩子死了...
Figure your kid's dead...

65
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,230
结果15年后 Patrick出现在门口
Then after 15 years, Patrick shows up at the front door.

66
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,700
一个14岁的孩子是怎么逃过国际追捕的?
How does a 14-year-old evade an international manhunt?

67
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,400
你最后一次看见他是什么时候?
When was the last time you saw him?

68
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,030
我大三前的暑假
The summer before my junior year.

69
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,360
哦 我当时爱上了... 欧洲
Oh, I fell in love with Europe.

70
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,560
我们去了每个城市的博物馆
We were going to museums in every city,

71
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,700
这是我做过的最棒的一次家教
and it was one of the best tutoring jobs I ever had.

72
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,600
可接着他就从瑞士的寄宿学校溜走了
But then he ran away from boarding school in Switzerland,

73
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,500
我再也没听说过他
and I never heard from him again.

74
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,800
有个用早期绘画大师的作品
Must be nice to have a father

75
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,400
迎接你回家的父亲真是太好了

76
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,730
他想为团聚派对准备大量的新画作
He wanted a lot of new pieces before the homecoming party.

77
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,830
哦 真期待见到他和William
Oh, well, it will be nice to see him

78
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,700
还有 哇哦 Bea那时还是个婴儿
and William, and, wow, Bea was just a baby.

79
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,600
- 当然还有Stanton  - Stanton是谁?
- And of course Stanton.  - Who's Stanton?

80
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,230
男管家 他就像是胶水一样
The butler. He was kind of the glue

81

- 把一家人凝聚在一起  - 只有一个管家?
- that kept the family together.  - Just one butler?

82
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,960
- 就亿万富翁而言他们很节俭  - 好了 我该走了
- Very frugal for gazillionaires.  - Okay, I'm leaving.

83
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,530
顺便告诉你 我会在画上
Hey, by the way, I'm gonna be putting alarms

84
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,900
装警报器的
on the art.

85
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,560
嗯
Mm.

86
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,130
嗷 不
Aw. No.

87
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,630
- 就亲一口  - 发生什么事了?
- Just one.  - What's going on?

88
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,260
- 你生病了?  - 快走
- You sick?  - Come on.

89

Mortensen房地产公司案
The Mortensen real estate scandal's

90
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,430

真希望可以
I wish it would.

92
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,060

Stanton 你还是可以叫我Elizabeth的

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,960
不幸的是 我不可以

爸爸 你不能炒了他
Dad, you can't fire him.

97
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,500
我跟你说了 这是侵犯劳动权的
I'm telling you it's a violation of labor rights.

98
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,600
Bea 等你从哈佛法学院毕业了
Bea, when you have graduated from Harvard law,

99
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,530
我们再聊这个不迟
we'll continue this conversation.

100
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,800
可那不是Stanton干的
But Stanton didn't do it.

101
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,630
- Elizabeth  - 啊 William

你还是个婴儿的时候我见过你
I met you when you were a baby.

105
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,700
嗯 我听说过

107
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,730
Elizabeth 我得向你道歉
Elizabeth, my apologies.

108
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,460
Bea花了太多时间读小说
Bea spends so much time with her head stuck in novels

109
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,530
现实生活对她来说太刺耳了
that the realities of life are all the harsher.

110
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,800
Stanton的事是真的吗?
Is it true about Stanton?

111
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,800
- 发生什么了?  - 他把我的健康状况
- What happened?  - He leaked the truth

112
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,300
透露给了媒体
about my health to the press.

113
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,300
这令我的生意遭受了损失 也是对我个人的背叛
It was damaging to my business and a personal betrayal.

114
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,860
听到这个消息我很难过

115
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,500
你怎么样?
How are you?

116
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,200
血糖浓度像市场走势一样忽高忽低
Well, blood sugar spikes like the market,

117
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,430
心跳时速24英里 不过去他的医生吧
ticker's on mile 24, but screw the doctors.

118
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,760

And? How is he?

120
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,600
他可是Patrick
Well, he's Patrick.

121
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,100
你知道 艺术是我们俩唯一的共同点
As you know, art was the only thing we had in common,

122
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,400
希望我们依旧能通过它来沟通
and I'm still hoping that's a way we can connect.

123
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,860

- You're taller.  - And lost the blue hair.

126
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,500
我更喜欢这个
I like this better.

127
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,000
你和过去一样美丽
You are as beautiful as ever.

128
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,000
哦
Oh. 

129
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,860
是啊 这个害我俩在佛罗伦萨美术学院里被踢了出来
Yeah, that got us kicked out of the accademia in Florence.

130
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,100
哇哦 你的伤疤也还在
Wow, you still have your scar too.

131
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,030
再问你 那匹马叫什么名字?
What was that name of the horse again?

132
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,300
- Cheval Chase  - 没错

133
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,600
在Stony Hill把我直接甩过了围栏
Threw me clear over the fence at Stony Hill.

134
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,400
那是我第一次以为要失去你了
Mm, and that was the first time I thought I'd lost you.

135
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,060
- 我去看看Bea  - 好的
- I'm gonna go check on Bea.  - Okay.

136
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,400
好了 小子
All right, kid,

137
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,860
我可有很多问题要问你
I've got a lot of questions.

138
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,960
在妈妈死后 我求我爸陪我和Bea
After mom died, I begged dad to let me stay in the city

139
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,500
留在城里
with him and Bea.

140
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,760
你妈妈的事我很抱歉
I was so sad about your mom.

141
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,600
爸爸想让我去读Le Rosey(一所瑞士贵族学校)
Dad wanted me to go to Le Rosey.

142
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,760
- 但我还没准备好  - 这就是你逃跑的原因?
- But I wasn't ready.  - Is that why you ran?

143
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,660
我受够了活在他的条条框框下
I was tired of living on his terms.

144
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,530
你那时只是个孩子
You were just a kid.

145
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,160
- 你怎么做到的?  - 存着零花钱
- How did you do it?  - Saved my allowance.

146
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,760
有天去滑雪 我就从采尔马特滑到切尔维尼亚
On a ski day, I snowboarded from Zermatt to Cervinia,

147
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,260
卖了装备 上了火车
sold my gear, hopped on a train,

148
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,500
再也没回头
and never looked back.

149
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,000
你这一走 你家里人很伤心
You put your family through hell.

150
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,430
为什么回来了?
What made you come back?

151
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,430
因为我爸爸
Dad.

152
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,200
报纸上都在传 说他病了
Rumors that he was sick were all over the papers.

153
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,530
我是为了他回来的 不是为了这种生活
I came back for him, not for this life.

154
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,660
他也在努力
He's trying.

155
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,800
就给我买艺术品?
By buying me art?

156
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,700
这就是他补偿你的方式
It's his way of bonding.

157
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,300
- 随他去吧  - 好吧
- Let him.  - Okay.

158
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,430
我还记得你的喜好
Well, I remember your tastes.

159
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,000
我们有荷兰画家的 巴洛克的

163
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,830
金短号的男子?
The Homme au Cornet?

164
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,200
我是随便放进来的
I put this in as a joke.

165
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,330
还记得索菲亚王妃博物馆吗?
Do you remember the Reina Sofia?

166
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,800
你说"格尔尼卡"画的就是超现实主义的
You called Guernica a bastard child

167
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,700
方块蠢小孩

168
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,730
还说毕加索的作品根本不漂亮
and accused Picasso of crimes against beauty.

169
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,660
我那时还小
I was a kid.

170
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,960
审美观是会变的
Tastes change.

171
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:37,960
你确定吗?
You sure?

172
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,500
就这幅 我挺喜欢的
Yeah. I love it.

173
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,600
我会让画廊送过来的
Well, I'll have the gallery send it over.

174
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,630
Elizabeth 富豪家怎么样?
Elizabeth. How's Downton Abbey?

175
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,160
我知道听上去可能很奇怪
I know this is gonna sound weird,

176
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,630
但我觉得这个Patrick Wolcott不是真的
but I don't think Patrick Wolcott is Patrick Wolcott.

177
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,660
因为他的眼睛 虽然颜色没错
It's his eyes. They're the right color,

178
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,860
但总觉得不是他
but it doesn't feel like him.

179
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,130
- 你觉得是冒名顶替的?  - 所以是有可能的
- You think he's an imposter?  - So it's possible.

180
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,960
很多人回去冒充富家子弟
Yeah, missing rich kids are a subset.

有人冒充Patty Hearst(美国传媒巨头)的孩子

William Wolcott是个完美目标

185
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,860
你会查查吗?
Will you look into it?

186
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,400
会 但我得跟Peter说一下...
Yeah. I have to run it by Peter, but...

187
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,460
他怎么样?
How he's holding up?

188
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,860
我去看看
I will find out.

感觉如何?
How are you feeling?

190
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,230
好得不能再好了
Tip-top. Million bucks.

191
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,500
哪怕他是个假的 你觉得
Even if he is a ringer, you're telling me

192
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,330
William Wolcott会认不清自己的儿子?
William Wolcott wouldn't know his own son?

193
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,130
骗子找的就是情感上的弱点
Emotion is a con man's sweet spot.

194
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,600
我有充分理由相信
And I have good reason to believe

195
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,630
这不是真正的Patrick
that that is not the real Patrick.

196
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,160
- 最好充分  - 很充分

197
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,430
- 最好非常充分  - 正是如此
- Better be damn good.  - It is.

198
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,730
什么理由?
Hmm?

199
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,130
你老婆的直觉算数吗?
Does your wife's intuition count?

200
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,860
- El打电话给你了?  - 我跟她说了
- El called you?  - I did say you guys were

201
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,200
让她最好直接找你
on the friends and family plan.

202
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,660
你是为了逃避Mortensen案 精心策划的吧?
Is this some elaborate ruse to avoid the Mortensen case?

203
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,860
这么说就伤感情了 因为如果这是真的
Okay, that hurts my feelings, because we're looking

204
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,200
那就涉及到伪造身份
at potential identity theft, fraud.

205
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,860
一个家族的财产岌岌可危
A family's fortune is at stake,

206
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,660
更别说那笔慈善基金
not to mention the charitable foundation.

207
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,200
有什么根据?
Based on what?

208
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,460
毕加索的画
Pablo Picasso.

209
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,260
他小时候很讨厌毕加索的作品 现在却让Elizabeth买一幅
Kid hated his work, and now he's pushing Elizabeth to buy one.

210
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,460
你想让我就以喜不喜欢毕加索
You want me to launch into an investigation

211
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,530
作为证据立案调查?
based on a Picasso snafu?

212
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,900
Peter 这就跟你突然变成Red Sox队的粉丝一样
Peter, this is like you suddenly becoming a Red Sox fan.

213
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,060
那我得...
I'd have to be...

214
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,900
- 我得...  - 你得怎样?
- I'm...  - You'd have to what?

215
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,500
我得彻底改头换面才会这样
I'd have to be a different person.

216
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,830
谢谢 这里真热
Thank you. It's hot in here.

217
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,160
你看上去不怎么好
Yeah, you really don't look good.

218
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,260
- 你应该回家  - 我不回家
- You should go home.  - I'm not going home.

219
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,700
我没生病 我从来没请过病假
I'm not sick. I've never gone home sick.

220
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,230
除了毕加索 你得给我别的证据
You're gonna have to give me more than Picasso.

221
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,300
还有可疑之处... Wolcott先生辞退了
Also suspicious... Mr. Wolcott fired his butler

222
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,760
用了30年的管家
of over 30 years.

223
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,760
- 好佣人总是很难找  - 或者他就是被陷害的
- Good help is hard to find.  - Or he was set up.

224
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,100
最明智的做法就是赶走
The smart move is to jettison

225
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,630
所有熟悉真正Patrick的人
anyone who intimately knew the real Patrick.

226
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,560
我们得做个DNA测试

227
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,960
他父亲没要求做

Okay, I'm not sending my wife in as a secret agent.

230
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,930

238
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,930
除非洗干净了
I don't air dirty laundry.

239
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,860
我不会晾晒脏衣服
I see that it's cleaned.

240
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,000
我不和任何记着说话

241

哦 谢谢

242
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,060
好 你也要一杯吗?
Yes. Would you like one?

243
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,900
抱歉
Excuse me.

244
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,800
从右边开始为客人倒水
One pours from the right.

245
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,330
一直从右边开始 让我来吧

246
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,760
- 您感觉很热吗 先生?  - 的确
- Are you feeling warm, sir?  - I am.

247
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,400
但我自己有手帕 谢谢
But I've got my own, thanks.

248
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,400
Stanton 我们并不是在讯问你
Stanton, you're not under investigation,

249
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,500
但的确有几个关于Patrick的问题想问你
but we do have questions about Patrick.

250
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,160
你有什么理由相信他不是真的?
Do you have any reason to believe this isn't him?

251
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,330
他当然长大了
He's grown, of course.

252
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,630
但他的行为举止...
But the mannerisms...

253
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,830
如果他是假的 肯定是仔细研究过了
If it isn't, he's a brilliant study.

254
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,460
如果他是假冒的 你应该揭穿他的
If he is a fraud, you could have exposed him.

255
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,800
他是故意陷害你的
He might have sabotaged you.

256
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,260
我们需要确凿证据
We need physical evidence.

257
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,730
如果DNA不匹配
A DNA mismatch would prove

258
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,200
就能证明他是假的
he isn't a Wolcott.

259
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,630
感谢Elizabeth的推荐
Thanks to Elizabeth's recommendation,

265
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,830
我明白
I am aware.

266
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,800
你在汉普郡工作了多久?
How long did you work in Hampshire?

267
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,630
知道他被抓到和公主厮混
Till he was caught with a princess.

268
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,600
是怀疑 我从来没被抓到
Suspected. Never caught.

269
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,000
但证据太奇怪了
But the evidence was overwhelming.

270
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,600
我可没偷银器
I didn't steal the silverware.

271
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,960
管家的工作可不只是
There is more to private service

272
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,600
服侍一群当地贵族
than consorting with the landed gentry.

我全想起来了
It all came back to me.

385
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,060

399
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,330
但他告诉的都只是些我知道的事
he's only told me things I already know.

400
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,800
你也许可以问问他的旅行见闻

他好像不愿意跟我多谈

而你不愿跟你不了解的人一起生活
And you don't want to be left with someone you don't know.

408
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,000

00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,400
我想您可以穿这个赴晚宴 先生

我一件也不会穿
I'm not wearing one.

413
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,830
我能问一下吗? 一个少年如何成功躲过了全球性的搜索?
May I ask, how does a teenager evade an international search?

414
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,000
篡改几位室友的护照
Doctored my dorm mates' passports,

415
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,300
用它们过境 如果需要物资

416
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,660
再把它卖掉
when I needed supplies.

417
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,000
物物交换节省现金 聪明
Bartered to conserve cash. Clever.

418
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,330
美瞳 棒球帽

419
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,260
变换了口音 七月份绕开了波托菲诺?
Switched up your accents and avoided Portofino in July?

420
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,430
我更喜欢圣托里尼
Santorini was more my style.

421
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,200
- 那是您的旅行日记?  - 我的旅行传奇

422
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,130

掉在爱情海了

00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,600
您很幸运 先生
You're lucky, Sir.

426
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,260
- 怎么说?  - 经历了这些
- Why's that?  - After all this,

427
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,960
您父亲还愿意认您
your father will take you back.

428
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,700
不如穿件外套吧

430

祝您晚餐愉快
Enjoy your dinner.

432
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,260
搞到你的指纹了
'Cause I got your print.

433
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,260
亲爱的 药茶
Honey, herbal tea.

434
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,000
好
Okay.

435
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,830
我放了姜
And I got ginger.

436
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,200
和欧斯洛可舒能(一种天然的感冒症状缓解药)
and oscillococcinum.

437
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,530
- 不要啦  - 听话
- Mm-mm.  - Mm-hmm.

438
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,130
不认识的东西我不吃
I don't eat things that I can't say.

439
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,660
我吃这些不认识的东西的时候
At least tell us how you lifted the cuff link

440
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,100
至少告诉我们你是怎么偷到袖扣的

好的
Sure.

445
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,160
我恐怕不喜欢这样
I'm not sure I like this.

446
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,060
把这扣在你的左袖口
Clip this to your left sleeve.

447
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,600
这没用的
This is not going to work.

448
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,060
肯定有用
Oh, it's gonna work.

449
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,030
我要从你手腕附近偷走一样东西

455
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,100
就是PDA
PDA.

456
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,930
还在啊
It's still there.

457
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,800
看你另一只手腕少了什么
From your other wrist.

458
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,460
我早告诉你要偷什么了
I even told you what I was gonna steal.

459
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,060
手表
Wristwatch.

460
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,200
呃 你的手法很温柔
Ugh. You have a gentle touch.

461
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,760
噢 噢 够了啊
Oh, oh, that's enough.

462
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,200
嘿 Jones
Hey, Jones.

463
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,860
好点儿了

明白 谢谢
Got it. Thanks.

465
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,100
哎 你会变戏法吗? 把坏消息变成
Well, do you have a magic trick that can turn bad news

466
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,300
- 好消息  - 怎么啦?
- into good news?  - Why, what's up?

467
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,330
袖口的指纹很完整
The prints on the cuff link

468
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,230
但它们的主人
were perfect, except they belong to a person

469
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,060
没有犯罪前科
who's never committed a crime.

470
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,900
人们很少让小孩子登记指纹
And it wasn't common to fingerprint kids

471
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,330
所以Patrick小时候的指纹也不在数据库里
when Patrick was younger, so he's not in the database.

472
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,530
我可以把指纹送去总部
I could send it to Quantico

473
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,330
做一个线粒体DNA测试
for a mitochondrial DNA test.

474
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,930
那太浪费时间 我能弄到一些DNA
That takes too long. I can get some actual DNA,

475
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,330
我们在这里测试就行了
and we can run the test here.

476
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,230
把袖扣送回去 试试我的方法

479
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,560
拿... 直接说偷不就完了
Grab... literally steal the silverware.

480
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,960
你是个老古董
You're a cliche.

481
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,660
别放在心上
Get over it.

482
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,360
他病的时候就是这么烦人
He's grumpy when he's sick.

483

484
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,430
- 过得如何?  - 噢 还行
- Hey, what's up?  - Oh, hey. Yeah.

485
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,560
在金色池塘还开心吧?
How's life on golden pond?

486
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,260
哦
Oh.

487
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,400
你开了一瓶布鲁奈罗
And I see you opened the Brunello.

488
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,100
没错 我给你留了...
Oh, yeah, I saved you...

489
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,400
- 请  - 谢谢
- Enjoy.  - Thanks.

490
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,230
嘿 Moz
Moz.

491
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,100
哦 只有这一次 我不是屋里
Oh, for once I'm not the only one in the room

492
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,000
- 唯一嗡嗡嗡的人  - 这声音肯定不止一个蜂巢吧
- with a buzz.  - It's loud for one hive.

493
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,530
我本来可以弄到三个的
I may have acquired three.

494
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,760
自从小Gianetta被抓走了 他老婆就提高警惕了 
Skinny Gianetta got nabbed, so his wife put out feelers.

495
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,660
所以 除了要假扮管家
So in addition to me being undercover as a butler

496
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,900
照顾Peter
and taking care of Peter,

497
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,130
我还要照管这一群蜜蜂孤儿们
I'm now the guardian of orphan bees.

498
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,600
猫咪探长得了什么病?
What ails the suit?

499
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,500
还不是现在四处扩散的流感病毒嘛
It's that flu that's going around.

500
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,700
太好啦
That's perfect.

501
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,230
像他那样倔的人正适合
It seems fitting that a man of his persuasion

502
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,030
做我的小白鼠
should be my guinea pig.

503
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,560
内含十八种氨基酸的
18 amino acids packed into an antimicrobial,

504
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,230
抗菌黄酮蜂蜜补品
flavonoid-filled, honey-based tonic

505
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,060
这药能消除你的症状
That will rid you of your symptoms

506
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,660
还能治愈皮肤疣 改善心情

增强性功能

要我把这个喝下去?

00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,760
现在喝一支 两小时后再喝一支
One now, the second in two hours,

512
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,730
再隔两小时喝下第三支
and the third within four hours of the first.

513
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,260
我一定是疯了 竟然考虑喝这种东西
Oh, I must be crazy to even consider this.

514
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,500
已经这样了 喝下去还会差到哪里?
Could you feel any worse?

515
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,630
可能不会
Probably not.

516
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,300
我得去Wolcotts家了
I got to get to the Wolcotts.

517
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,960
早点儿好 Peter
Feel better, Peter.

518
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,760
我先不走 观察观察
I'll stay here and observe.

519
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,600
观察什么? 会怎么样?
Observe what? What's gonna happen?

520
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,260
呃 前十五分钟... 呃 我们拭目以待
Well, the first 15 minutes... Well, let's see.

521
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,800
- 就这样定了  - 爸 我不想这样
- Well, it's going to happen.  - Dad, it's not what I want.

522
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,460
我想这样 什么也别说了
It's what I want. Consider that.

523
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,960
我的律师会送过来的
My attorney is sending it over.

524

526
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,100
就没有商量的余地了?
So this conversation's over.

527
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,560
我想是的
In my mind it is.

528
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:55,560
那我们聊聊别的吧
Let's talk about something else.

529
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,000
你知道吗? 曾经毕加索烧了他的画 就为了取暖
Did you know that Picasso used to burn his own work for warmth?

530
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,060
对 他是这么做过
That's right. He did.

531
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,730
先生
Sir.

532
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,630
啊 弄错了
Oh, this was a mistake.

533
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,530
应该送去给公司经理
It was supposed to go to the business manager.

534
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,000
给你
Here you go.

535
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,960
谢谢 午安
Thank you. Good afternoon.

536
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,900
该喝第二瓶了
Time for vial number two.

537
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,660
Mozzie去哪了?
Where'd Mozzie go?

538
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,900
他得回去看看他的皇后
He needed to check on his queen.

539
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
我猜他说的是蜂后
Assuming he meant bee,

540
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,730
- 不过他...  - 还真是说不准
- but with him...  - You never know.

541
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,600
这信是给你的
Ugh. This came for you.

542
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,700
我不能打开 是寄给William Wolcott的
I can't open it. It's for William Wolcott.

543
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,660
但收信人写的是Peter Burke
But it's addressed to Peter Burke.

544
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,130
好吧 恐怕你妻子
You know, I think your wife

545
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,130
得帮你打开 因为你病得不行了
had to open it for you because you're extremely sick.

546
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,900
再说了 没人会知道的
Besides, no one will ever know.

547
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,460
我们可以再封起来
We can just reseal it.

548
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,000
Neal真是把你给带坏了
Neal's a very bad influence on you.

549
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,130
- 好了  - 哇 完好无损
- Oh, yes.  - Wow. That was perfect.

550
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,500
Neal知道Patrick
Neal found out

551
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,860
想要什么了... 一份信托基金
what Patrick's after... a trust fund.

552
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,430
他本该在21岁的时候继承的
He was supposed to inherit it when he was 21.

553
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,400
他们今天在重新整理书面材料
They're redoing the paperwork today.

554
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,460
- 四千万美元  - 是的
- $40 million.  - Yeah.

555
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,260
亲爱的 他拿到这笔钱就会消失的
Honey, if he gets that, he's gonna disappear.

556
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,630
William的心脏怎么承受得住
William's heart can't take that.

557
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,160
我得让他知道事情的真相
I got to let him know what's going on.

558
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,060
不 把William带到联邦调查局
No. Bring William to the FBI.

559
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,800
我要跟他谈谈
I want to talk to him.

560
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,130
我不确定这个Patrick会耍什么花招
I'm not sure what this Patrick is capable of.

561
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,560
他可能是个危险人物
He could be dangerous.

562
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,960
亲爱的 要知道 跟一个父亲谈这个太残酷
Babe, look, this is a hard conversation to have

563
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,230
该找他的朋友来说
with a father, and it needs to come from a friend.

564
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,500
而且 你不要太着急
Besides, you need to take it easy.

565
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,000
不 我等不及了
No, I don't want to take it easy.

566
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,730
- 我感觉好多了  - 很好
- I feel better.  - Well, that's great.

567
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,260
我会让你知道Wolcott家的情况的 好吗?
I'll let you know how it goes at the Wolcotts', okay?

568
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:56,730
还有 我要你躺下休息
Besides, I want you to lay down.

569
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,000
William 我不是故意
William, I'm not trying

570
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,200
惹你不高兴
to upset you.

571
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,000
嫁给一个联邦调查局探员
Being married to an FBI agent

572
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,260
把你变得疑神疑鬼了
has made you cynical.

573
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,530
该注射胰岛素了 先生
It's time for your insulin, sir.

574
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,630
这跟Peter没任何关系 好吗?
This has nothing to do with Peter, okay?

575
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,300
- 我也被骗了  - 别再说了 Elizabeth!
- I was fooled too.  - I'm offended, Elizabeth!

576
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,730
你们吵得好大声
The whole house can hear you.

577
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,900
- 太荒唐了  - 让Patrick做个血液测试
- This is ridiculous.  - Patrick should have no problem

578
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,700
- 应该没什么难的  - 你不相信我?
- consenting to a blood test.  - You don't believe me?

579
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,400
好吧 现在就抽血吧
Fine. Draw the blood right now.

580
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,560
我不需要 Patrick
I don't need this, Patrick.

581
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,500
但她需要
She does.

582
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,800
不知道还有多少人认为你是个傻瓜呢?
How many others think you're a fool?

583
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,130
我是不会用针头刺我亲生儿子的
I won't stick a needle into my own son.

584
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,730
好吧
Okay.

585
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,460
我自己来
I'll do it.

586
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,160
给你
There.

587
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,330
做测试去吧
Test it.

588
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,200
这座房子跟街道平行
The house is equidistant from the avenues,

589
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,700
但我们不想让他跑那么远
but we don't want him to get that far.

590
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,530
Wolcott宅邸的入口 出口
Entry and exit points

591
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,430
还有楼上的几扇窗户
of the Wolcott residence, upper windows too.

592
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,500
运载车那里我们要安排三名探员
We're gonna have three agents by the utility van,

593
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,330
- 再增派两名内线...  - 三名
- two more undercover...  - Three more.

594
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,030
Peter 你是个病原体
Look, Peter, you're a biohazard.

595
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,000
我的病快好了
I'm on the mend.

596
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,330
我发誓
I swear.

597
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,360
喝了这个就...
And after this...

598
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,730
什么玩意儿?
What is it?

599
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,860
不知道
I don't know.

600
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,500
- Mozzie给我的  - 天啊
- Mozzie gave it to me.  - Oh, God.

601
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,530
这药挺管用的
It works.

602
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,800
我要参加这次行动 我老婆还在里面呢
I'm in on this bust. My wife is in there.

603
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,200
等到一切真相大白了 我们就进去逮捕他
When it all goes down, we'll move in for the arrest.

604
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,530
好孩子 快走 Chauncey
Good boy. Come on, Chauncey.

605
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,100
看来Mozzie的药起作用了
It looks like Mozzie's tincture's working.

606
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,460
我不用上DL名单了
I'm coming off the DL.

607
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,130
棒球用语 伤残名单
Baseball. Disabled list.

608
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,900
你有没有检查他们作亲子测试的实验室?
Did you check out the lab they used to test the blood?

609
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,300
实验室没问题
It's reputable.

610
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,900
我在那儿安插了一个探员 以防Patrick做什么手脚
I put an agent there in case Patrick tried anything.

611
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,060
William让我们去家里取了血样
William had the sample picked up from the house.

612
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,500
我把它封起来亲自交给技术员了
I sealed it and handed it to the technician myself.

613
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,430
就是说Patrick全程没有干涉
So Patrick didn't tamper with it.

614
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,130
没有 但我敢肯定就算DNA测试结果是"不匹配"
No, but I'm sure he has something planned

615
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,860
他也早想好该如何应对了
when the DNA comes back a mismatch.

616
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,000
我想知道会是什么预谋 录下来
I want to know what it is. Audio.

617
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,860
听到吗
Check one, two.

618
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,960
听到吗
Check one, two.

619
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,130
我会保护Elizabeth的
I'll keep an eye on Elizabeth.

620
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,430
快走 Chaunce 快走
Come on, Chaunce. Come on.

621
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,060
真乖
That's a good boy.

622
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,660
一切都顺利吧 Bea小姐?
Everything all right, Miss bea?

623
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,500
血液测试结果出来了
The blood tests are back.

624
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,760
现在就是我们见证事实的时刻了 Carlyle
What we have here, Carlyle, is a real moment of truth.

625
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,130
大家听着 我有事要宣布
Everyone, I have news,

626
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,300
请听好
and you need to hear it.

627
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,100
你们都很辛苦地在准备
You've all been working very hard

628
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,230
周日的宴会
to prepare for the party on Sunday,

629
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,100
但计划有变
But there's been a change of plans.

630
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,260
明天的庆祝取消
The celebration will now take place tomorrow.

631
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,830
我再也等不及了 我要马上迎接
I don't want to wait any longer to welcome home

632
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,400
我的儿子
my son.

633
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,060
我很高兴能回家
I'm so glad to be back.

634
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,560
我本不该让你经历这些的
I shouldn't have put you through this.

635
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,830
- DNA结果是"匹配"  - 同时我想感谢Elizabeth
- The DNA was a match.  - Also I want to thank Elizabeth

636
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,460
为她所做的一切
for all that she's done.

637
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,200
今天是她在这里工作的最后一天
Today is her last day.

638
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,630
William 很抱歉
William, I'm sorry.

639
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,630
你知道我只是关心你和Bea
You know I was just thinking of you and Bea.

640
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,600
我能给我儿子的时间所剩无几了
The days I have left with my son are numbered.

641
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,130
逼他做这件事
Forcing him to do this,

642
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,500
有可能会导致他离开这个家
he could have walked out the door,

643
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,030
而如果果真如此 那都是你造成的
and it would have been your fault.

644
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,160
我会派人把支票给你
I'll send your check.

645
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,460
我做错了什么?
What did I do?

646
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:39,860
我被炒鱿鱼了
Oh. Well, I'm fired,

647
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,730
你也不用再假扮管家了
and you don't have to be a butler anymore.

648
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,960
我还不能离开
I can't just leave.

649
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:49,360
我想看看那个法国女仆到底如何
Maybe I'll see how French that maid really is.

650
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,060
Liz 我试图劝父亲来着
Liz. I tried to talk to my father,

651
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,160
但你知道的 他非常固执
but you know how stubborn he is.

652
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,630
他很生我的气
Well, he's upset with me,

653
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,860
可以理解
and I can understand that.

654
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,030
我已经遛过Chauncey了
I already took Chauncey on his walk.

655
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,800
好吧 不过我听到他咳嗽
Oh. Well, I heard him coughing.

656
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,960
得带他去看兽医
I'm gonna take him to the vet.

657
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,630
要是他不舒服
Well, if he's not feeling well,

658
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,730
- 就不该走着去  - 又不远
- he shouldn't walk.  - It's not far.

659
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,230
他要是连呼吸都困难就算远了
It is if he can't breathe.

660
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,430
别担心 我开车送他们
Don't worry. I'll drive them.

661
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,260
我去开车
I'll get the car.

662
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,330
再见 Burke太太
Good day, Mrs. Burke.

663
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,800
保重 Patrick
Take care, Patrick.

664
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,000
你也保重 Liz
You too, Liz.

665
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,060
在这等着
Wait here,

666
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,100
不许离开半步
and don't move the car.

667
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,160
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

668
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,760
Peter 听着 Patrick很讨厌那条狗
Hey, Peter. Patrick hates the dog.

669
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,760
现在却送他去看兽医
Now he's bringing it to the vet.

670
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,230
我都听到了 你身上有监听设备
I heard. You're wired.

671
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,430
你从我的手下Godfrey摇身一变成了"艾斯·文图拉"
You've gone from my man Godfrey to Ace Ventura.

672
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,430
{\an8}"艾斯·文图拉" 电影"神探飞机头"主角 一位专与动物打交道的宠物侦探

673
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,060
我是要跟你说 他有新动作
I'm telling you, he's got another move.

674
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,230
Neal 记得按兵不动
Neal, recon only.

675
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,300
发现任何线索 立刻告知我
You find anything, you pull me in.

676
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,600
没问题
You got it.

677
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,560
- 嘿  - 嘿
- Hey.  - Hey.

678
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,800
我身体好了 完全好了
I feel good. Really good.

679
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,060
太好了 你和Wolcott家的狗身体一样好
Great. You and the Wolcotts' dog.

680
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,760
Patrick是去为自己看兽医的
Patrick went to the vet for himself.

681
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,460
我看到那个技术人员从他的胳膊这里
I watched the tech remove something from his arm

682
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,860
- 取出了什么  - 塑料的?
- right here.  - Plastic?

683
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,360
- 是的  - 像一截血管?
- Yeah.  - Look like a vein?

684
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,560
不知道 大概是这个东西的三分之二长
I don't know. It was about 2/3 this size.

685
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,300
是彭罗斯引流
That's a Penrose drain.

686
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,300

688
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,400
一个人植入了这样一根
a guy implanted one

689
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,200
来蒙混DNA测试
to fool a DNA test.

690
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,300
装有别人的血液?
Filled with someone else's blood?

691
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,660
没错
Yeah.

692
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,030
难怪Patrick要自己抽血
That's why Patrick drew his own.

693
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,600
血液还是新鲜的
This blood was fresh.

694
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,830
也就意味着真正的Patrick Wolcott
Which means 48 hours ago

695
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,100
在48小时之前仍然活着
the real Patrick Wolcott was alive.

696
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,330
而且就在纽约
And in New York.

697
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,760
你看 咱们干得不错
You know, we're kind of good at this.

698
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,060
怎么了?
What?

699
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,760
William打算明天签下信托基金
William's signing over the trust fund tomorrow.

700
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:23,960
而一旦冒牌Patrick得手...
And once fake Patrick gets what he wants...

701
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,160
他就不需要让真的Patrick活下去了
he won't have any reason to keep the real Patrick around.

702
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,360
没错
No.

703
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,160
我们抓了那个兽医
We pulled in the vet tech.

704
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,830
当然了 他概不承认彭罗斯引流的事
Of course he denies implanting a Penrose drain.

705
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,430
我们搜查了现场 没有发现人造血管
We searched the property. No signs of the tubing.

706
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,530
那我们把他扣着 免得他跑去给Patrick通风报信?
We're holding him on suspicion so he can't tip Patrick off?

707
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,260
最好如此
You better believe it.

708
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,960
可是 没有家里人的允许
Well, we won't get a warrant for another DNA testing

709
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,260
我们搞不到授权再对其进行一次DNA测试
without permission from the family.

710
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,200
咱们干嘛不干脆把那个人渣抓来
Why don't we just grab the bastard

711
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,660
当面告诉他我们知道人造血管的事了?
and tell him we know about the drain?

712
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,000
我也想啊 可是咱们没有筹码
Tempting, but we have no leverage.

713
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,530
那就搞些筹码来
So let's get some leverage.

714
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,400
- 怎么弄?  - 嗯
- How do we do that?  - Hmm.

715
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,430
毕加索
Picasso.

716
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,860
是啊 是啊 毕加索
Yeah, yeah, Picasso.

717
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,600
好了 我们这位冒牌做足了功课
All right, our imposter learned everything he could

718
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,030
尽可能详尽地了解了Patrick的一生
about Patrick's life.

719
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,830
但他对Elizabeth那个毕加索的事并不知情
But he didn't know Elizabeth's Picasso story,

720
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,830
也就是说他并非无所不知
which proves he doesn't know everything.

721
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,000
是啊 而且他事先不知道的事情
Yeah, and he doesn't know

722
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,000
现在一定是不知道的
what he doesn't know.

723
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,360
我们要问他
We need to ask him

724
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,100
一些他认为只有真的Patrick才会
something that he thinks only the real Patrick

725
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,830
- 知道答案的事情  - 便可以促使他
- knows the answer to.  - And give him a reason

726
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,230
去寻找那个答案
to get that answer.

727
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,260
Elizabeth刚问过他毕加索的事...
Elizabeth asks him about Picasso...

728
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:27,760
第二天早上他就突然都知道了
the next morning he knows everything.

729
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,630
自行车出行
The bike rides.

730
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,300
他每天早上都骑自行车出去 每次都是一个小时
He goes on one every morning. It's always for an hour.

731
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,760
他一定是这样来维持Patrick活着的
That's got to be how he's keeping Patrick alive.

732
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,000
而且问到了毕加索那件事
And how he got the Picasso story.

733
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,600
- 还有血样  - Jones 在那附近
- And the blood.  - Jones, get a radius

734
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,800
设下包围圈... 开车 骑车 步行 怎么都行
set up in op... car, bike, foot, whatever.

735
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,130
只要确保无论如何我们不会跟丢他
Make sure we stay on him wherever he goes.

736
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,530
明白
Gotcha.

737
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,830
Patrick离开了15年
Patrick was gone for 15 years.

738
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,760
他应该不是一开始就结识了这个冒牌
He probably didn't meet the imposter right away.

739
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,200
他从寄宿学校逃走之后
The first time he was spotted after he ran away

740
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,530
首次被人看到是在杜塞尔多夫(德国西北部城市)
from boarding school was at Dusseldorf.

741
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,630
就在这个时候Leo Kovak出现了
And that's where Leo Kovak comes in.

742
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,260
谁是Leo Kovak?
Who is Leo Kovak?

743
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,100
这问题要麻烦冒牌Patrick去解答了
He's the reason fake Patrick has to get the answer.

744
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,330
谁是Leo Kovak?
Who is Leo Kovak?

745
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,860
让我当Leo Kovak?
I'm Leo Kovak?

746
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:06,060
你是一个气急败坏的克罗地亚人
You are a very angry Croatian.

747
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,860
你为Von Kesslers工作
You work for the Von Kesslers,

748
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,060
而你想知道在杜塞尔多夫到底发生了什么
and you want to know what the hell happened in Dusseldorf.

749
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,530
在杜塞尔多夫发生了什么?
What happened in Dusseldorf?

750
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,930
你... 你得演得再像一点
It's... it's got to be more convincing.

751
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,460
- 杜塞尔多夫那次到底怎么回事?  - 没什么
- What happened in Dusseldorf?  - Nothing.

752
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,900
但Patrick不知道这点
But Patrick doesn't know that.

753
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,530
克罗地亚人发明了领带
Croatians invented neckties,

754
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,000
我敢肯定你的衣橱里有那么一条
and I'm sure you've got something in your closet

755
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,060
能完美演绎一名暴怒的巴尔干半岛人
that screams enraged balkan.

756
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,800
我演不来克罗地亚人
I can't do Croatian.

757
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,500
我要演波兰人
I'm going Polish.

758
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,130
咱们去找条合适的领带吧
Let's pick out that tie.

759
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:37,230
Kovak先生来这里见您
Mr. Kovak is here to see you.

760
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,400
我是Von Kesslers的朋友
I'm a friend of the Von Kesslers.

761
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,200
当然 Von Kesslers
Of course. The Von Kesslers.

762
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,330
自从杜塞尔多夫一面已经过去很久了
It's been a while since Dusseldorf.

763
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,700
谢谢你 Carlyle
Thank you, Carlyle.

764
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:57,860
我一直通过报纸关注你和你的故事 Patrick
I followed you and your story in the papers, Patrick.

765
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,660
我们就是这样找到你的
That's how we found you.

766
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,960
抱歉 我...
I'm sorry. Do I...

767
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,230
你应该为你的所作所为追悔莫及
You should be sorry for what you did.

768
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,160
- 先生 我不太明白  - 别跟我装傻
- Sir, I don't understand.  - Don't play stupid.

769
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,900
别开始哭哭啼啼的
Don't start crying.

770
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,330
Von Kesslers雇了我来处理这个问题
The Von Kesslers pay me to handle their problems.

771
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:23,230
我该付给他们多少钱来平息这份不愉快?
Is there any way I can pay them for this inconvenience?

772
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,200
你以为你的所作所为能用几个子儿来衡量吗?
You think you can put a price on what you did?

773
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,960
花点小钱就能摆平?
That money can make this go away?

774
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:31,230
想都别想 他们要的是一个答复
No. They want answers.

775
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,360
来自主厨的款待
Compliments of the chef.

776
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,500
还需要什么吗 先生?
Anything else, sir?

777
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,430
一支钢笔 还有纸
A pen and something to write.

778
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,430
联系我 只要你合作 我们就能让杜塞尔多夫的事过去
Call me. We can make Dusseldorf go away.

779
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,230
你要是不合作 那就只好今晚的派对上见了
But if you don't, I'll see you at your party tonight.

780
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,360
我自己出去就行
I'll show myself out.

781
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,300
恕我直言 先生...
If I may, sir...

782
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,630
那家伙不像是在虚张声势
that threat didn't sound hollow.

783
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,700
我得出去骑会儿车
I'm going for a bike ride.

784
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,930
请尽情享用新鲜空气
Enjoy the fresh air.

785
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,460
他出了116号街的晨兴公园
He's exiting the park at morningside and 116th.

786
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:40,930
我跟上他了
I've got him.

787
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,600
坐在这车里我都不会觉得你是个联邦探员
I wouldn't peg you for a fed in this car.

788
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,960
路障都设好了
Perimeter is all set.

789
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,300
我们要把Patrick抓个现行
We'll pinch Patrick at the location.

790
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,800
我们等的时候
While we're waiting,

791
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:58,000
我能不能...
may I...

792
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,930
多谢 Leo
Thanks, Leo.

793
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,000
向北朝曼哈顿区去了 交接班
North on Manhattan. Handing off.

794
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,360
听听!
Listen to that!

795
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,000
114号街 急转弯
Hard turn, 114th.

796
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,500
探员倒下! 目标跟丢了!
Agent down! We lost the suspect!

797
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,230
Neal 我来开
Neal, get out.

798
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,430
我是个管家 专门训练过的
I'm a butler. I'm trained for this.

799
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,400
叫救护车来
Call an ambulance.

800
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,090
所有探员到第一大道和114号街会和
All agents to first avenue and 114th street.

801
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,560
Burke探员和Caffrey正赶过去
Agent Burke and Caffrey are en route.

802
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,700
二队看到他了 在西边116号街
Team two has him. West on 116th.

803
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,930
这就是116号街
This is 116th.

804
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,430
Neal啊
Neal.

805
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,860
- Neal  - 闭上眼睛
- Neal.  - Don't look.

806
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:13,960
我忍不住要看
I have to look. I can't help it.

807
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:17,160
找到他了
There he goes.

808
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,030
在晨兴公园和115街角落
Lost sight of the suspect

809
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,260
失去嫌疑人踪影
at the corner of morningside and 115th.

810
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:28,360
这管家大学培训得真到位
That must be some butler college.

811
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,560
他把Patrick关哪里了?
Where's he keeping Patrick?

812
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,400
他刚才就在那儿 一定就在附近
He was just here. Got to be somewhere close.

813
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,600
好了 我们得一家一户找
All right, we're gonna have to go door to door.

814
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,700
一个队负责这栋楼 那边
I want a team on this building, down there,

815
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,600
另一个队负责街对面
and a team across the street.

816
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,760
二队 我们走
Team two, let's go.

817
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,760
- 嘿 Peter  - 诶 有什么头绪?
- Hey, Peter.  - Yeah, what do you have?

818
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,860
可能扯得有些远
This may be a long shot,

819
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,230
但Patrick说过他把他的
but Patrick said he dropped

820
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,930
航行日志掉在爱琴海里过
his travel journal in the Aegean.

821
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,930
未必是爱琴海 不管怎样咱们来看看
Not exactly the Aegean, but let's have a look.

822
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,730
最后问你一遍 杜塞尔多夫
