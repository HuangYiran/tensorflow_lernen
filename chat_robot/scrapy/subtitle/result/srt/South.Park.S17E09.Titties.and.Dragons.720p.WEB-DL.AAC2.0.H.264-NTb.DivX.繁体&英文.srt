南方公園  第十七季第九集
魔龍的奶舞

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,730
《南方公園》
前情回顧

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,370
我們馬上就要展開有生以來最慘烈的戰斗
Soon we will be the fighting the greatest battle of our lives.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,710
黑色星期五
Black Friday.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,110
想要PS4的人  加入我們這邊
Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us.

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,160
你不能死  大家真的很喜歡你
You can't die everybody really likes you.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,650
我們才不會被叛徒賤人肯尼打敗呢
We're not going to be beat by the traitor whore Kenny.

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,760
戰況如此一邊倒似乎是一種恥辱
Seems a shame that the fight will be so one-sided.

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,880
然后找喬治·馬丁問到答案
Go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.

13
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,360
他就是《權力的游戲》的作者
He's the guy who write Game of Thrones.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,700
你當上加拿大健衛部長
You started as the Canadian minister of health

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,910
三個月后  你太太開始朝你陰吹
and 3 months later your wife queefed in your face.

16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,220
這必將是一場操蛋的血戰  湯姆
This is gonna be a f*cking bloodbath Tom.

17
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,350
雞雞  雞雞雞雞  雞雞雞雞*
*Wiener. Wiener. Wiener. Wiener. Wiener. Wiener. Wiener

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:52,610
兩只雞雞傍地走*
*One wiener next to another wiener

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:00,420
三只雞雞好朋友*
*Two wieners alongside yet another wiener

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:07,010
軟雞雞  松趴趴  不舉雞雞*
*Soft wieners, nice and soft, non-erect wieners

21
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,730
彈雞雞  彈雞雞  彈雞雞*
*Flopping wieners, flopping wieners...

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,870
肯尼公主

23
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,310
不好了  微軟封鎖了我們船只的去路

24
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,120
是嗎

25
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,020
很快  船就完全不能通行了

26
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,940
黑色星期五就要來了

27
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,530
是個問題

28
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,660
現在  要是肯尼公主在  就好了

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,330
我回來了

30
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,880
肯尼公主拜見

31
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,870
出現了

32
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,400
肯尼公主好可愛

33
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,490
肯尼公主  感謝你的到訪

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,830
有個麻煩

35
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,070
Xbox的船封鎖了我的PS4的船只

36
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,330
船運停止了

37
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,860
明白  肯尼公主來幫忙

38
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,950
難道是要封鎖我們

39
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,020
快看  是肯尼公主

40
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,760
各位  肯尼來了

41
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,460
他干嗎了
He did what?

42
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,910
他跳傘空降  然后干嗎了
He flew down in a parachute and did what?

43
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,710
然后他阻止了微軟
Apparently he's stopped Microsoft

44
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,800
對PS4船運到購物中心的封鎖
from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall.

45
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,900
看來他現在四處奔走
It looks like he's all over the place

46
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,480
為索尼贏機型大戰啊
winning the console wars for Sony.

47
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,400
憑  憑什么  就憑他可愛
Because... because what? Because he's cute?

48
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,140
卡特曼  他讓所有人都站在索尼一邊了
Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side.

49
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,040
我們阻止不了他
We can't stop him.

50
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,220
但是除了裝可愛他還干了什么
But what's he do besides that he's cute?

51
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,740
親愛的  比爾·蓋茨打電話找你
Sweetie, Bill Gates is on the phone for you.

52
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,800
你叫比爾·蓋茨一邊玩蛋去
Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass mom.

53
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,970
媽  你別真叫比爾·蓋茨去玩蛋
Mom, don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass,

54
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,550
跟他說一切安好
tell him that everything is cool

55
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,900
待會兒我給他回電話
and I'll call him in a little bit.

56
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,430
要是你一開始就讓肯尼當他的公主
This wouldn't have ever happened if you would have let him be a princess

57
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,620
就不會有這些事了
in the first place.

58
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,540
他不是公主  他是個漢子
He's not a princess, he's a dude.

59
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,600
不幸的是  他現在是對手了
Well, unfortunately for us he's now on the other side.

60
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,310
我們別無選擇了
We're out of options.

61
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,840
你想說什么  凱爾
So what are you saying, Kyle?

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,950
我有個主意
I have an idea.

63
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,220
我也不想這樣  但恐怕這是唯一的選擇了
I dont like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.

64
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:13,030
黑色星期五  南方公園購物中心

65
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,670
湯姆  黑色星期五終于要到了
Tom, black Friday is finally almost here

66
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,680
如你所見  我身后的假日購物者已失去耐心
and as you can see behind me holiday shoppers are really getting antsy.

67
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,990
人們從感恩節半夜就等在這了
People have been waiting here since midnight on Thanksgiving.

68
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,690
他們饑寒交迫
They are cold, they are starving

69
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,290
在節日酬賓活動中  已經發生多起流血事件
and there's already been a lot of bloodshed over these holiday deals.

70
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,760
有請瑞克·泰爾默  他已經在這守了六天了
Joining me now is Rick Tellmor who's been here for 6 days,

71
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,830
你五歲的兒子被吃掉了  是真的嗎
and your five-year-old son was eaten, is that correct?

72
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,050
是的  是的沒錯  我們不得不吃了他
Yes, yes, that's right, we had to eat him,

73
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,500
我們都開始餓得不行了
we're all started to starve out here,

74
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,950
所以我們抽簽  他抽到了死簽
so we drew straws and he drew the shortest one.

75
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,230
黑色星期五到來的時候  你想買什么呢
What is you hoping to get when blace Friday does finally start.

76
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,640
藍光播放機
A blu-rayplaying.

77
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,560
96%的降幅  折后是20美元
96% off, and it's gonna be about 20$.

78
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,130
現在有人可能會說
Now some people might say

79
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,160
吃自己的孩子不太符合圣誕的感覺
that eating your child is not very christmassy.

80
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,630
對他們你想說點什么呢
What would you say to them?

81
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,280
我為播放機吃孩子  還要哈哈笑*
*I ate my son for a blu-ray player with a ho, ho, ho

82
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,240
還要把鈴搖*
*and a jingle jingle jingle

83
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,620
兒子吃下肚  味道很不俗*
*My son got aten and he tasted good

84
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,040
還要哈哈笑  還要把鈴搖*
*Ho, ho, jingle, jingle ho-ho

85
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,110
無疑  南方公園購物中心的圣誕節活躍而美好
No doubt Christmas is alive and well at the South Park mall.

86
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,460
現場的情況就是這樣  湯姆
Back to you, Tom.

87
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,170
弟兄們  計劃是這樣的
Ok guys, here is the deal.

88
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,600
購物中心大門已經被成千的等待購物者堵死了
The main entrance in the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers.

89
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,580
而想要Xbox的小孩打算從左側翼突入
The kids who want Xboxes plan to flank from the left,

90
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,240
這里
here.

91
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,060
想第一個進入購物中心  最好的辦法
Our best chance being frist inside

92
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,980
就是找到一條能到達最后面入口的路
is finding a way to the most back entrance,

93
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,700
這里
here.

94
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,110
"紅羅賓"餐廳
At Red Robin.

95
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,900
沒錯
That's right.

96
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,080
"紅羅賓"里面的門
Red Robin has doors on the inside

97
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,190
穿過去正好是購物中心里
that go right out into the mall.

98
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,980
不論誰想第一個進去
The kid asks being the frist one is inside

99
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,870
都要在黑色星期五之前拿下"紅羅賓"
is taking over the Red Robin before blace Friday starts.

100
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,690
我們怎么拿下"紅羅賓"呢
So how do we take over Red Robin?

101
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,420
我也不知道
I have no idea.

102
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,820
打攪一下
Excuse me.

103
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:42,790
什么事
Yes.

104
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,380
Xbox的戰士來了
The Xbox fighters are here

105
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,160
他們說  想叛隊
and they say they want to switch sides.

106
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,260
什么
What?

107
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,940
直接跟他說  卡特曼
Go ahead and tell him, Cartman.

108
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,870
好吧
Alright.

109
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,760
我們代表所有Xbox的戰士們
On behalf of the Xbox fighters of Zaron,

110
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,660
在此放下武器  我們放棄了  行了吧
we hereby lay down our arms. We give up. OK?

111
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,630
閉嘴  克雷格  這是個艱難的決定
Shut up, Craig. It's very difficult.

112
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,250
你們贏了  行了吧
You guys win, all right?

113
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,170
我們都玩PS4吧
We all play on Playstations 4s.

114
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,180
雖然我們還是覺得Xbox更棒
We still think Xbox is a superior machine,

115
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,810
但你們這邊人太多了
but you guys have too many people on your side,

116
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,830
而且肯尼成了日本的公主
and Kenny became a Japanese princess.

117
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,160
這點太出乎意料了
Nobody saw that coming.

118
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,400
聽著  現實情況是
Look, the truth is,

119
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,640
你們知道我們面臨著更大的問題
we all have a bigger problem now and you know it.

120
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,940
要是我們不齊心協力的話
Nobody's going to get anything

121
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,490
我們沒法在其他數千名消費者中搶到任何東西
if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.

122
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,800
拿到PS4總比什么都沒有強  是嗎
So better a PS4 than nothing, is that it?

123
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,660
我們還是靠自己算了
I think we'll take our chances on our own.

124
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,340
我們知道怎么進紅羅賓
We know a way inside the Red Robin.

125
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,460
你不會以為只有你想到了吧
You don't think you're the only one who thought of it.

126
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,020
我們原本也打算利用紅羅賓的入口
We were going to use the red robin entrance too

127
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,410
而且我們想到了方法
and we figured out how.

128
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,270
紅羅賓是可以出租的
Red Robin can be rented out,

129
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,630
用作婚禮會場
for wedding parties.

130
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,490
大家都出點錢
If we all chip in,

131
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,740
就可以湊夠舉行婚禮的保證金了
we can pay for the deposit to have a wedding party there.

132
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,010
這辦法可行
Hey. That could work.

133
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,500
咱們一起干吧
Let's do this together, dude.

134
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,620
要想玩新一代游戲機  只有團結合作
Our only shot of playing any next gen console is by teaming up.

135
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,350
要是你想玩PS4
If you want to game on a PS4,

136
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,700
那我也玩
then I do too.

137
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,220
你確定你能接受嗎
And you swear you'd be okay with that?

138
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,870
再也不說Xbox更好了嗎
You won't ever talk about the Xbox being better ever again?

139
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,290
斯坦  我發誓
I swear, Stan.

140
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,820
好吧伙計們  咱們得計劃一場婚禮了
All right guys. Looks like we have got a wedding to plan.

141
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,710
大事不妙

142
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,670
這個機型之戰還遠遠沒有結束

143
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,750
是啊

144
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,030
Xbox和PS4的銷量不相上下

145
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,680
各位  不要緊的

146
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,660
肯尼公主會更加努力

147
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,380
肯尼醬  打攪一下

148
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,380
有一封給你的婚禮請柬  請看一下

149
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,030
婚禮嗎

150
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,880
邀請您參加在紅羅賓餐廳的婚禮

151
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,130
肯尼醬  請速歸
Kenny, please come home at once.

152
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,300
我們兩家不再對抗了
Our two houses have found peace.

153
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,100
快來紅羅賓餐廳的婚禮
Come to the Red Robin wedding

154
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,910
我們都將承認您公主的身份
and we'll all accept you as the princess you are.

155
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,990
此致敬禮  巫師王
Yours truly, the wizard king.

156
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,000
太厲害了

157
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,250
肯尼公主要去參加婚禮了

158
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,220
肯尼公主  感謝你所做的一切

159
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,620
多保重呀  肯尼醬

160
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,660
肯尼公主  再見

161
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,480
大家  再見

162
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,850
現在肯尼公主就要回到朋友們的身邊去了

163
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,260
怎么回事

164
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,790
肯尼公主死了

165
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,010
真的呢  肯尼公主死了

166
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,180
快看

167
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,990
肯尼公主  不要緊哦

168
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,670
哇哦  好可愛哦

169
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,620
斯坦爵士  我想和你談談婚禮的事情
Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.

170
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,790
沒問題  怎么了
Yeah, sure. What about it?

171
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,220
等商場開門了  我覺得你待在
I think it's best when the time comes for the mall to open,

172
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,330
離門稍遠的地方比較好
you should stay back a bit from the doors.

173
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,120
為什么
Why?

174
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,220
想想看
Well, think about it.

175
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,990
最先進去的人將要承受
The first people inside gonna have to take on

176
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,310
從主入口進入的其他消費者的沖擊
the brunt from the holiday shoppers from the main entrance.

177
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,820
讓巴特斯和斯考特·梅爾·金森先進去比較好
It's best we let Butters and Scott Mal Kinson go first.

178
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,420
當他們戰斗時  我們就可以溜進去了
While they fight, we can simply slip on by.

179
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,930
是有那么些道理
I guess that make scence,

180
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,760
但是巴特斯和斯考特就拿不到PS4了
but Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.

181
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,200
確實是這樣  但是
Yes, that's true. But...

182
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,820
面對現實吧  斯坦爵士
That's face it, sir Stan.

183
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,300
這其實就只關于你和我得到PS
This is all about you and me getting playstations.

184
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,230
其他人的存在只是為了幫我們...
The rest are simply there to help us get through...

185
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,750
他是騙你的
He's lying to you.

186
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,710
他們是假裝放棄了  但實際是在騙你
They're just acting like they're giving up but it's a double-bluff.

187
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,440
靠
Dude.

188
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,990
他們會在紅羅賓婚禮上背叛你的
They're going to betray you at the Red Robin wedding.

189
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,350
他照搬了《權力的游戲》里面的點子
He got the idea watching Game of Thrones.

190
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,170
我靠  給老子閉嘴
Dude, shut the fuck up.

191
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:17,890
他是誰
Who is that?

192
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,610
就一個瘋老頭
He's just an old crazy guy

193
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,790
他不喜歡我在他的花園里玩
who gets pissed off because I was in his garden all the time.

194
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,170
他們會把你關起來的
They're gonna lock you in.

195
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,780
我?個操?  閉嘴
God damn it. Shut up.

196
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,580
他在我的花園里和另外三人說過同樣的話
He talked about it in my garden to like three other people.

197
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,160
他們會把你關在紅羅賓
They're gonna lock you in the Red Robin

198
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,250
然后去買Xbox
and then go get all the Xboxes,

199
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,570
所以他才希望你離門遠一點
that's why he wants you to stay back from the doors.

200
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,910
你怎么不去干跟全世界說啊
Well, why don't you just tell the whole world everything, hum?

201
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,560
既然你在看《普羅米修斯》
Why don't you tell everybody what Prometheus was about

202
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,030
告訴大家它講什么啊
while you are at it?

203
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,750
凱爾知道這件事嗎
Did Kyle know about this?

204
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,680
伙計  別這樣  我們不會背叛你的
Dude, we're not gonna betray you, come on.

205
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,730
你看過《普羅米修斯》了嗎
Did you see Prometheus?

206
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,620
我覺得編劇都不知道自己在編啥
I don't think the writer even knew what that is about.

207
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,440
凱爾到底知不知情
Did Kyle know about this?

208
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,690
這就是凱爾的主意
Kyle thought of it.

209
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,150
斯坦  哥們  等一下
Stan. Dude, hold on.

210
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,400
Xbox ONE超贊的
Xbox one is fucking sweet, dude.

211
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,870
你個大混蛋
You're a fucking asshole.

212
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,040
草  滾出我家花園
Fuck you. Get out of my garden.

213
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,620
我拉你一泡屎
I'll shit in your fuckin garden.

214
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,010
去死吧
Go fuck yourself.

215
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,660
經過漫長等待  黑色星期五終于到來了
Well, the wait is over and Black Friday is finally here.

216
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,790
奈爾斯·勞森正在現場  時候到了  奈爾斯
Niles Lawson is at the scene. And it's about time, Niles.

217
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,940
沒錯  湯姆
That's right, Tom.

218
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,860
商場經理說他們已準備就緒
Mall officials have said they are ready,

219
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,460
大門在嘉賓剪彩之后
and doors will open as soon as their guest of honor

220
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,480
就會打開
cuts the ceremonial red ribbon.

221
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,950
今年的剪彩嘉賓是喬治·馬丁
This year's ribbon cutter is of course George R. Martin

222
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,310
他似乎還沒抵達現場
who doesn't appear to have shown up yet,

223
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,450
但據說正在趕來的路上
but says he is on his way,

224
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,620
正如他書中始終在路上的龍和僵尸們
just like the dragons and zombies in his novels he is on his way.

225
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,840
等一下
Now just hold on a minute.

226
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,480
我很確定騎馬不是去科羅拉多最快的方式
I'm pretty damn sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on a horse back.

227
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,940
的確  但是馬有其他交通工具
That may be true but horses have one quality that is unmatched

228
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,010
無法比擬的特點
by any other mode of transportation.

229
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,890
是什么
What's that?

230
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,060
百年好合

231
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,960
很好
Okay. Cool.

232
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,360
能面對面擺兩個草坪長桌嗎
Can we set up the two lawn tables like facing each other,

233
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,500
然后這里擺一個給新郎新娘
and then another for the bride and groom back there.

234
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,710
我聽到一個八卦
I heard a rumor.

235
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,940
能問一下嗎
May I ask?

236
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,870
是誰要結婚啊
Who's this that's getting married?

237
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,960
湯姆·漢克斯和碧昂絲
Tom Hanks and Beyonce.

238
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,620
是真的嗎  真的嗎
It's real? It's for real?

239
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,630
天啊  我好愛他們的
Oh my god. I love them.

240
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,650
我也愛
Yeah. Me too.

241
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,770
所以碧昂絲跟Jay Z分手了嗎
So Beyonce's not with Jay-Z any more?

242
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,590
很明顯啊  不然她也不會
Well, clearly or she wouldn't be

243
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,390
在紅龍蝦餐廳跟湯姆·漢克斯結婚啊
marrying Tom Hanks at Red Lobster if she was.

244
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,800
伙計們  不要那張桌子
Guys, guys, not that table.

245
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,750
去拿好的來
Get the good tables.

246
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,280
這可是貴賓  好嘛
This is VIP. Ok?

247
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,760
有誰知道巴特斯和斯考特死哪去啦
Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott? Where the fuck are they?

248
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,680
卡特曼
Cartman,

249
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,250
我聽說斯坦識破我們的計劃了
I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan.

250
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,340
是的
Yes, he did.

251
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,570
你到底要干嘛
What the hell are you doing?

252
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,080
這下要失敗了
This is not gonna work now?

253
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,060
沒關系  凱爾
It's fine, Kyle.

254
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,800
一切都在掌控之中
Everything has been taken care of.

255
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,480
斯坦不會再跟任何人有任何交流了
Stan won't be telling anybody anything ever again.

256
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,630
你個豬做了什么
What the hell did you do?

257
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,080
做了該做的  這樣我們才能
What had to be done so that we can

258
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,100
用Xbox玩游戲  凱爾
play our games on Xboxes, Kyle.

259
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,540
別跟我說你真那樣做啊
No. Tell me you didn't.

260
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,520
他不可以出來
He's not allowed to come out of his room,

261
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,940
所以你就隔著門跟他說吧
so you can talk to him through the door.

262
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,840
謝謝  馬什女士
Thanks, Mrs. Marsh.

263
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,330
長話短說  他這次惹的麻煩大了
And keep it short. He's in real trouble.

264
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,690
竟敢在一個好心大爺的花園里大便
He defecated in a nice old man's garden.

265
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,890
好的
Okay.

266
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,750
斯坦
Stan?

267
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,260
斯坦
Stan?

268
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,060
我在
Hello?

269
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,830
誰啊
Who's that?

270
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,370
斯坦  是我
Stan. It's me.

271
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,850
滾出去
Get out of here.

272
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,960
我知道你現在很生我的氣
Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now.

273
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,380
你要明白我那么做
You got to understand that I did it

274
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,860
是因為我心里明白
because I know in my heart

275
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,560
Xbox是我們最好的選擇
that the Xbox is better for all of us.

276
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,000
你完全背叛了我們最后的一點友誼
You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.

277
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,400
你也耍手段了  哥們
You weren't playing fair, dude.

278
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,830
讓你爸去商場太不公平了
Getting your dad to work part-time in the mall wasn't fair.

279
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,770
我根本就不知道  凱爾
I didn't even know he is working in the mall, Kyle.

280
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,790
真的嗎
You didn't?

281
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,820
而你也會不直接來問我
But you couldn't have just asked me

282
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,810
因為Xbox人都不關心真相
because Xbox people don't care about the truth.

283
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,460
他們只關心無縫多媒體聯接
They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.

284
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,330
對不起  斯坦
I'm sorry, Stan.

285
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,700
對不起
I'm sorry.

286
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,510
這整個戰爭毀了我們倆
This whole war's just got us so screwed up.

287
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,540
我只是想用對的機器來玩《使命召喚》
I just want us to play Call of Duty on the right machine.

288
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,880
你不會明白的
You don't understand.

289
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,260
我再也不會跟你一起玩《使命召喚》了
I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.

290
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,790
斯坦  別這么說啊
Stan, don't say that.

291
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,560
滾出去  我跟你玩完了
Get out of here. I'm done with you.

292
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,040
媽媽
Mom!

293
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,250
媽媽
Mom!

294
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,550
把他趕出去
Get him out of here!

295
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,580
快點
Get him out!

296
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,360
聽著  現在就剩下我們八個了
Now listen up, there are only eight of us now.

297
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,760
彼得森是個好人
Peterson was a great guy

298
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,760
他不應該那樣身首異處
and he did not deserve to get beheaded like that.

299
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,110
我不知道你們如何  我是受夠了
Now I don't know about you but I am sick and tired of getting to

300
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,550
受夠了去了解人們和他們的個性
know people here, getting invested on their personalities

301
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,550
他們的身世  然后看著他們死
and their backstory and then having them die.

302
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,480
那扇門打開之時  我們要團結一致
When those doors open, we all stick together.

303
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,690
誰膽怯了就將置我們于死地
If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk.

304
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,480
挺住  菜鳥
Stay tough, rookie.

305
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,130
我們挺不過去的  頭兒
We're not going make it, sir.

306
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,530
我們能挺過去
We're going to make it!

307
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,800
你剛出生的小女兒
You've got a newborn little girl

308
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,600
需要她爸爸挺過去
who needs her daddy to make it.

309
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,680
我不會讓你死的  好嗎
I'm not going to let you die, okay?

310
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,670
好
Okay.

311
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,520
-好不好  -好的  頭兒
- Okay? - Yes, sir.

312
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,500
好的  頭兒
Yes, sir.

313
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,390
我不會再眼睜睜地看著一個好人死掉
Not one more good person dies on my watch.

314
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,290
天哪  他們從房頂進來了
Oh, my god, they're coming in through the roof!

315
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,570
我做不到
I can't do this.

316
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,400
對不起  我做不到
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

317
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,910
站住別動
Stay at your post.

318
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,350
不
No!

319
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,910
不
No!

大家真的都很喜歡他
Everybody really liked him!

321
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,070
不
No!

322
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,350
開始了  湯姆
Here we go, Tom.

323
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,480
喬治·馬丁終于到了

324
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,060
來為超市剪彩

325
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,240
女士們先生們  很榮幸今天早上來到這里
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to be here this morning

326
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,500

on behalf of south park mall partners and channel 9 news.

327
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,760
你的新聞  天氣和體育媒體

趕緊剪
Just do it.

329
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,630
很好
Very well.

330
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,840
依照祖祖輩輩的傳統
In the tradition of our ancestors,

331
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,100
讓我們歡慶節日的到來
Let's ring in the holidays!

332
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,480
但首先  關于我的雞雞有幾句話想跟大家分享
But first I'd like to share with you a few words about my wiener.

抱歉  紅羅賓餐廳今天有特殊活動不營業
Sorry, guys, Red Robin is closed for a special event.

336

我們又重歸于好  真是太好了
How awesome that we're all friends again.

340
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,460
我們兩大家族合二為一
Our two houses brought together.

341
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,590
很快我們都會有PS4了
Soon we'll all have our playstation 4s.

342
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,440
敬你  我的老朋友肯尼公主
And to you, my old friend, princess Kenny.

343
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,960
你看起來魅力難擋
You really look stunning.

344
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,270
毫無疑問上帝也會對著你的咪咪微笑
No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs.

345
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,040
恕我失陪  公主殿下
Now if you'll excuse me, my lady,

346
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,670
我要去拉一泡屎
I need to take a shit.

347
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,730
你有什么發現
What have you found out?

348
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,340
超市還沒開門
The mall isn't open yet.

349
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,640
他們在等喬治·馬丁剪彩
They're waiting for george R.R. Martin to cut the ribbon.

350
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,290
好  那得有一陣子了
Okay. That could be a while.

351
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,850
我們的人都準備好了
All our men are ready.

352
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,530
超市一開門  就吹哨
When the mall opens, blow the whistle.

353
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,840
我們沖出去
We'll rush through the doors

354
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,640
把這幫索尼傻逼鎖在里面
and lock the sony dorks inside.

355
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,180
好了  我真要去拉屎了
All right, now, I really do need to take a shit.

356
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,160
粉嫩的身體  紫色的腦袋
Oh, soft and pink with purple head,

357
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,370
你溫柔地跟我在床上躺著
gently, you lay with me on my bed.

358
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,980
趕緊剪啊  喬治·馬丁
Get on with it, George R.R. Martin!

359
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,560
嗷嗷  空中的雞雞咆哮起來
Growl, growl calls the wiener from on high,

360
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,010
小小雞雞  看上去特別可愛
a little tiny wiener still so pleasing to the eye.

361
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,790
別扯雞巴蛋了
Enough with the wieners already.

362
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,510
快點
Yeah, come on!

363
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,470
克萊德
Clyde?

364
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,470
克萊德死哪去了
Where the hell is Clyde?

365
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,390
克萊德
Clyde?

366
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,020
肯尼公主  我覺得是時候
Princess kenny, I believe it's time

367
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,310
回敬巫師的款待了
we return the wizard's hospitality.

368
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,130
這是搞毛
What the hell is this?

369
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,030
抱歉  卡特曼
I'm sorry, Cartman.

370
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,530
計劃有點小變化
There's been a little change in plan.

371
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,940
凱爾爵士  超市就要開門了
Sir, kyle, they're about to open the mall.

372
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,960
你干什么
What are you doing?

373
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,760
我不再是xbox這邊的人了
I am no longer an xbox guy.

374
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,490
我害朋友關了禁閉
I let my friend get grounded.

375
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,000
但今天我會給他拿到PS
But today I will get him a playstation.

376
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,410
凱爾  PS的游戲柄爛透了  你是知道的
Kyle, the playstation controller sucks, and you know it!

377
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,790
戰爭結束了  卡特曼
The fight is over, Cartman.

378
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,120
還沒有結束
It's not over.

379
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,550
看上去我來得正是時候
Looks like I came just in time.

380
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,410
比爾·蓋茨  好樣的
Oh, Bill Gates, sweet.

381
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,680
給你當頭一棒  凱爾
In your face, Kyle.

382
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,460
你不準插手  比爾·蓋茨
You will not interfere, Bill Gates!

383
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,360
這些孩子會得到PS4
These children will get their ps4s.

384
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,050
等等
Wait a minute.

385
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,110
這兩個家伙怎么會在這
How the hell did these two guys end up here?

386
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,440
那不是你叛變計劃的一部分嗎
They're not part of your betrayal?

387
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,030
不是  那不是你叛變計劃的一部分嗎
No. They're not part of your betrayal?

388
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,020
不是
No.

389
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,480
那么這是誰的叛變計劃
Who's betrayal is this?

390
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,580
我們不要再叛變了
We're done with betrayals.

391
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,260
是時候來個了結了
It's time to put an end to this.

392
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,460
斯坦
Stan?

393
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,000
頭兒  上面說他們要我們一個人去
Sir, sir, operations just said they need one of us to

394
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,370
打開紅羅賓的門
unlock the door to Red Robin to

395
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,420
讓某個婚禮的人進入超市
let some wedding party inside the mall.

396
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,050
去他們的  讓他們自己搞定
Screw them, they'll have to fend for themselves.

397
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,930
等等  紅羅賓婚禮
Wait, Red Robin wedding?

398
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,480
誰要結婚
Who's getting married?

399
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,360
湯姆·漢克斯和碧昂絲
Tom Hanks and Beyonce.

400
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,330
什么
What?

401
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:55,000
天哪  人人都愛湯姆·漢克斯和碧昂絲
Oh, my god, everybody loves Tom Hanks and Beyonce!

402
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,680
我得去救他們
I got to save them

403
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,490
我感謝你試圖做的一切  凱爾
I appreciate what you're trying to do,Kyle.

404
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,860
可我有更好的主意
But I have a better idea.

405
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,870
這不是我們的戰爭  伙計們
This isn't our war, you guys.

406
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,190
向來不是
It never was.

407
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,420
我們就為了倆公司的營銷策略
We've been pitted against each other by two companies

408
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,810
而大打出手
for the sake of marketing.

409
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,300
所以他們要在街區設立分界線
That's why they want lines around the block.

410
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,390
他們需要戰爭好推銷他們的產品
They want a war to promote their product.

411
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,160
他們才不管這會讓多少友誼成為犧牲品
They don't give a crap what kind of friendship that costs.

412
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,280
你們這么想打仗嗎
You want a war so bad,

413
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,240
那你倆打吧
