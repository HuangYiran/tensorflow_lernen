00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:02,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neighbors heard them screaming at each other...

3
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like, for two hours. And there's nothing new.

4
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:07,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.

5
00:01:08,842 --> 00:01:10,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A crime of passion.

6
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:12,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

7
00:01:12,842 --> 00:01:15,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just look at all the passion on that wall.

8
00:01:15,672 --> 00:01:18,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a done deal. All but the paperwork.

9
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The kid see it?

10
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:25,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

11
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:27,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The kid?

12
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What fucking question's that?

13
00:01:30,752 --> 00:01:32,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're all gonna be real glad...

14
00:01:32,822 --> 00:01:35,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when we get rid of you, Somerset. You know that?

15
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:36,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Always these questions with you.

16
00:01:36,712 --> 00:01:39,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Did the kid see it?" Who gives a fuck?

17
00:01:39,192 --> 00:01:41,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's dead. His wife killed him.

18
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:43,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything else, it has nothing to do with us.

19
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:54,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Detective Somerset?

20
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:57,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Detective Mills.

21
00:01:57,342 --> 00:01:59,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lieutenant, I apologize for interrupting.

22
00:01:59,612 --> 00:02:01,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get in town 20 minutes ago,

23
00:02:01,672 --> 00:02:03,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they dump me here.

24
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:04,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look...

25
00:02:04,882 --> 00:02:06,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mills?

26
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:09,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't we find a bar or someplace, you know. Sit and talk.

27
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to get to the precinct, if it's all the same.

28
00:02:11,222 --> 00:02:13,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know. Not much time for this transition thing.

29
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:16,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna ask you something,

30
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:18,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when we spoke on the phone before.

31
00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:21,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why here?

32
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:24,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't follow.

33
00:02:24,402 --> 00:02:27,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, all this effort to get transferred.

34
00:02:28,302 --> 00:02:30,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the first question that popped into my head.

35
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:33,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess the same reason as you.

36
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:36,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or the same reason you had before you decided to quit, yeah?

37
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:40,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just met me.

38
00:02:41,282 --> 00:02:43,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe I'm not understanding the question.

39
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:46,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's very simple.

40
00:02:47,222 --> 00:02:50,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You actually fought to get reassigned here.

41
00:02:51,722 --> 00:02:53,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've just never seen it done that way before.

42
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:54,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thought I'd do some good.

43
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:57,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look. It'd be great if we didn't start out...

44
00:02:57,992 --> 00:02:59,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}kicking each other in the balls.

45
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:03,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But you're calling the shots. Lieutenant. - Yes.

46
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:08,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to look and I want you to listen. Okay?

47
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:11,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I wasn't standing around guarding a Taco Bell.

48
00:03:11,222 --> 00:03:13,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've worked homicide 5 years.

49
00:03:13,142 --> 00:03:14,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not here. - I understand that.

50
00:03:14,912 --> 00:03:17,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, over the next 7 days, Detective,

51
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:19,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you'll do me the favor of remembering that.

52
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:40,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Se7en

53
00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:23,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Monday

54
00:07:03,662 --> 00:07:04,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello.

55
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:07,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

56
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:09,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say it again?

57
00:07:12,272 --> 00:07:16,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought we moved here to get away from tractor pulls.

58
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Serpico's got to go.

59
00:07:23,782 --> 00:07:26,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, well, you might want to get rid of this little...

60
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:29,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}crusty, this eye, Serpico.

61
00:07:29,452 --> 00:07:31,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did you get it? - Got it.

62
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:32,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

63
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coffee? No?

64
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:57,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing's been touched. Everything's like I found it.

65
00:07:58,072 --> 00:07:59,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What time was death established?

66
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like I said...

67
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:02,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't touch anything...

68
00:08:03,582 --> 00:08:05,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he's had his face in a plate of spaghetti

69
00:08:05,412 --> 00:08:07,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for 45 minutes now.

70
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:09,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute. No one bothers with vital signs?

71
00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:12,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did I stutter? This guy ain't breathing...

72
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:14,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce.

73
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:18,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's how it's done here? - I beg your pardon, Detective.

74
00:08:18,362 --> 00:08:21,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This guy's sitting in a pile of his own piss and shit.

75
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:23,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he wasn't dead he would've stood up by now.

76
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:25,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Alright. - Thank you, officer.

77
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

78
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:38,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wonder.

79
00:08:41,112 --> 00:08:43,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What exactly was the point of the conversation

80
00:08:43,562 --> 00:08:45,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you were about to get into?

81
00:08:45,552 --> 00:08:46,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't know.

82
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:48,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many times has Barney Fife found dead bodies

83
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:50,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that weren't dead.

84
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:53,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drop it.

85
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:27,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody phone Guinness. I think we've got a record here.

86
00:09:44,122 --> 00:09:46,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Better Home and Gardens"

87
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:54,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spaghetti sauce

88
00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:58,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who said this was murder?

89
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:00,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one.

90
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:05,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guy's heart must be the size of a canned ham.

91
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:10,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If this isn't a coronary...

92
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:13,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well... I don't know.

93
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:41,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about that.

94
00:10:51,392 --> 00:10:53,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had this case once...

95
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:56,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}guy dead on the ground...

96
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:59,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}knife in his back. Gotta be murder, right?

97
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:02,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck!

98
00:11:03,402 --> 00:11:06,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway, big insurance policy involved, yeah? So the guy...

99
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:08,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}took the tip of the blade...

100
00:11:08,632 --> 00:11:11,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}stuck it in his own shoulder blades.

101
00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:14,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He must've screwed up a few times 'cause there was...

102
00:11:14,212 --> 00:11:16,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- multiples back there. - Could you please be quiet.

103
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute.

104
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:28,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

105
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:32,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got a bucket here.

106
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:35,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's in it?

107
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:42,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh god!

108
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fucking vomit.

109
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:47,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any blood in it?

110
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:50,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't see any. Help yourself.

111
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:57,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you thinking it's poison?

112
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:01,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, wonderful. Very moody.

113
00:12:01,582 --> 00:12:03,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you thinking it's poison, Somerset?

114
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:06,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You girls have got forensics waiting outside.

115
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:08,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know if we'll all fit, though.

116
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:10,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's room. Light's the problem.

117
00:12:10,652 --> 00:12:11,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are you?

118
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:15,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Detective Mills, would you go help the officers...

119
00:12:15,322 --> 00:12:16,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}question the neighbors.

120
00:12:19,592 --> 00:12:20,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

121
00:12:20,832 --> 00:12:22,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And send in forensics on your way out, please.

122
00:12:38,242 --> 00:12:39,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's dead.

123
00:12:41,112 --> 00:12:42,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, doctor.

124
00:12:48,682 --> 00:12:51,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've seen my files, right? You've seen things I've done?

125
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:53,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nope.

126
00:12:56,162 --> 00:12:58,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did my time on door-to-doors and walking the beat.

127
00:12:58,782 --> 00:13:00,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did that shit for a long time.

128
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:05,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And? - My badge says... "Detective".

129
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:06,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The same as yours.

130
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:10,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I made a decision.

131
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:13,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had to consider the integrity of the scene...

132
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:15,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couldn't worry whether you thought

133
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:17,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you were getting enough time on the playingfield.

134
00:13:17,512 --> 00:13:18,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, man...

135
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:23,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just don't jerk me off. That's all I ask. Don't jerk me off.

136
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:32,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's been dead a long time,

137
00:13:32,402 --> 00:13:34,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I can tell you it's not a poison.

138
00:13:34,392 --> 00:13:35,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, man.

139
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:37,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How does someone let themselves go like that?

140
00:13:38,562 --> 00:13:41,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It took four orderlies just to get him on the table.

141
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:47,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But how'd the fat fucker fit out his front door?

142
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:49,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please. It's obvious he was a shut-in.

143
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:52,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at this. See how big this stomach is?

144
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:55,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the strange thing is stretches.

145
00:13:55,472 --> 00:13:58,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at the size of the cardiac orifice, where the food...

146
00:13:58,742 --> 00:14:01,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see that, but it means nothing to me.

147
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:05,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, he's got lines of distention... across the duodenum.

148
00:14:05,852 --> 00:14:07,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the interior wall's ripped open.

149
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:11,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This man ate till he burst?

150
00:14:11,692 --> 00:14:14,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He didn't really burst. Not all the way.

151
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:16,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was hemorrhaging internally.

152
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:19,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a hematoma in the rectus and...

153
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- the transverse abdominous muscles. - He did die by eating?

154
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes and no.

155
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:28,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about these bruises up here?

156
00:14:29,872 --> 00:14:31,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't figured that out yet.

157
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:33,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gun pressed against his head?

158
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:35,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pressed hard enough, sure.

159
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck, yeah.

160
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Marks from the front side flush with the muzzle.

161
00:14:41,752 --> 00:14:45,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves a homicide.

162
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:51,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Killer put a bucket beneath him, kept on serving.

163
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Took his time too.

164
00:14:52,722 --> 00:14:55,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coroner said this could have gone on for more than 12 hours.

165
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:59,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Victim's throat was swollen, probably from the effort...

166
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:01,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and there was definitely a point when he passed out.

167
00:15:02,062 --> 00:15:04,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's when the killer kicked him...

168
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:06,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- and he burst. - Sadistic fucker.

169
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:09,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you want somebody dead, you drive by and shoot him.

170
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't risk the time it takes to do this...

171
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:15,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- unless the act itself has meaning. - Come on.

172
00:15:15,972 --> 00:15:17,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody had a problem with a fat boy

173
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:19,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and decided to torture him.

174
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:20,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Simple as that.

175
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:21,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the grocery bags...

176
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:23,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we found two receipts. That means,

177
00:15:23,482 --> 00:15:25,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the killer stopped in the middle of everything ...

178
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and made a second trip to the supermarket.

179
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:28,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So?

180
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:33,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, it's his thing. I've been out in the rain all day.

181
00:15:33,762 --> 00:15:35,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is beginning. - We've got...

182
00:15:35,822 --> 00:15:37,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one dead guy, not three.

183
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:38,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No motive.

184
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:42,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't even start that big brain of yours

185
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}cooking on this, alright? Please.

186
00:15:44,662 --> 00:15:46,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to be reassigned.

187
00:15:46,982 --> 00:15:48,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

188
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:51,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell are you talking about?

189
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:53,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This can't be my last duty.

190
00:15:53,742 --> 00:15:55,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just gonna go on and on.

191
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:57,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're retiring.

192
00:15:57,052 --> 00:15:59,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Six more days you're all the way gone.

193
00:15:59,412 --> 00:16:01,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Won't be the first time you've left unfinished business.

194
00:16:01,682 --> 00:16:03,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those cases were taken as close to conclusion

195
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:05,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as humanly possible.

196
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:08,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And if I may speak freely? - We're all friends here.

197
00:16:08,622 --> 00:16:10,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not being his first assignment.

198
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:14,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. I knew it. This is not my first assignment, you dick.

199
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:15,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's too soon for him.

200
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:19,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm right here. You can say that shit to my face. Captain?

201
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:20,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's too soon for you.

202
00:16:21,462 --> 00:16:22,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Captain...

203
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:24,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we can just talk in private?

204
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:26,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Obviously this isn't work. This is a personal thing...

205
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:27,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just shut up, Mills.

206
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:29,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I don't have anyone else...

207
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:33,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to put on this and you know it. This is metro...

208
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:36,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You don't just get to swap. - Give it to me.

209
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:39,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Say what? - Yeah, he doesn't what it, fuck him.

210
00:16:39,302 --> 00:16:42,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, but see you later, have a nice time. Give it to me.

211
00:16:42,282 --> 00:16:44,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm putting you on something else.

212
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:49,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on, Mills, just go on.

213
00:16:55,122 --> 00:16:58,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, old buddy, but it looks like you're stuck...

214
00:16:58,462 --> 00:17:00,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}cleaning up the fat man.

215
00:17:07,702 --> 00:17:10,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tuesday

216
00:17:12,802 --> 00:17:15,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Murder has a new uptown address!

217
00:17:15,642 --> 00:17:17,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Attorney found murdered

218
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:20,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quiet down.

219
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:23,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright, calm down. Calm down.

220
00:17:23,982 --> 00:17:25,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quiet down.

221
00:17:28,892 --> 00:17:30,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, here's how it's going to be...

222
00:17:31,152 --> 00:17:34,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll answer questions for 10 minutes and 10 minutes only.

223
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:37,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If those questions do not comes in a calm,

224
00:17:37,052 --> 00:17:38,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}sane, orderly fashion

225
00:17:38,622 --> 00:17:40,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm on my way out.

226
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Detective? Detective?

227
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can I have a moment of your time? - No.

228
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:52,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't discuss the details of this ongoing investigation,

229
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:53,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so don't even bother asking.

230
00:18:00,052 --> 00:18:03,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he is. That's the guy.

231
00:18:03,802 --> 00:18:07,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It looks like we won't be eating dinner.

232
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:10,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is this kid, anyway? Hotshot.

233
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have you guys got for me?

234
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:16,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing yet, boss.

235
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:22,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you guys go get a coffee, huh?

236
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:26,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have this breaking story.

237
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:29,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going to live downtown where the defense attorney...

238
00:18:29,682 --> 00:18:31,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eli Gould was found murdered this morning.

239
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:33,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}District attorney Martin Talbot

240
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is taking questions from reporters.

241
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:40,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Conflict of interest between your office...

242
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:42,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's ridiculous to the point of being offensive.

243
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:44,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is no conflict whatsoever,

244
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:47,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and any claim there could be is irresponsible.

245
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:49,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now hold on.

246
00:18:51,352 --> 00:18:52,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me address that.

247
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:55,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've just come from a meeting of law enforcement officials

248
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:59,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they assured me, they have their very best men on this.

249
00:18:59,962 --> 00:19:03,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This will be the very definition...

250
00:19:03,902 --> 00:19:05,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of swift justice.

251
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:09,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Greed

252
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:30,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pardon me, George.

253
00:19:35,162 --> 00:19:36,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somerset.

254
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:37,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come in.

255
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you heard the news?

256
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nope, haven't heard.

257
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:44,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eli Gould was found murdered this morning.

258
00:19:44,662 --> 00:19:48,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone broke into his law firm and bled him to death.

259
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:51,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wrote the word "greed" on the floor.

260
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:59,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Greed? - Yeah, in blood.

261
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:02,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mills is heading up the investigation.

262
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:04,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. Excuse me.

263
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:07,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you not do that, please?

264
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:12,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well. Good for him.

265
00:20:12,392 --> 00:20:13,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell will you do...

266
00:20:13,892 --> 00:20:15,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with yourself out there, Somerset?

267
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:19,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm. Fix my house.

268
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:20,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you feel it?

269
00:20:21,332 --> 00:20:23,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you feel that feeling?

270
00:20:23,902 --> 00:20:26,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not going to be a cop anymore.

271
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:28,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the whole idea.

272
00:20:30,072 --> 00:20:31,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think you're leaving.

273
00:20:32,412 --> 00:20:34,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hell, you can't leave all this.

274
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:38,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guy's out walking his dog.

275
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:40,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gets attacked.

276
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:43,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His watch is taken, his wallet.

277
00:20:43,552 --> 00:20:44,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And while he's lying...

278
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on the sidewalk helpless...

279
00:20:47,252 --> 00:20:50,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His attacker stabs him in both eyes.

280
00:20:51,622 --> 00:20:54,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This happened just last night about 4 blocks from here.

281
00:20:55,262 --> 00:20:56,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I read about it.

282
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:59,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand this way anymore.

283
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the way it's always been.

284
00:21:01,502 --> 00:21:05,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Maybe you're right. - You do this work. You're made for it.

285
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I don't think you can deny that.

286
00:21:08,672 --> 00:21:10,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe I'm wrong.

287
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:14,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The coroner sent this down for you.

288
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Found them in the fat boy's stomach...

289
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:21,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}mixed in with the food. Looks like little pieces of...

290
00:21:21,812 --> 00:21:23,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- plastic. - Set them on that desk, please.

291
00:21:27,882 --> 00:21:29,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were...

292
00:21:29,452 --> 00:21:30,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}fed to him.

293
00:23:10,242 --> 00:23:11,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lord.

294
00:23:11,312 --> 00:23:13,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gluttony

295
00:23:19,582 --> 00:23:21,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was found on the wall behind

296
00:23:21,262 --> 00:23:23,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the refrigerator at the obesity murder scene.

297
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:26,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Long is the way

298
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:30,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and hard, that out of hell leads up to light."

299
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:31,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's from Milton.

300
00:23:32,362 --> 00:23:33,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Paradise lost."

301
00:23:34,422 --> 00:23:35,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright...

302
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:36,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm confused.

303
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:39,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It means that this is beginning.

304
00:23:39,262 --> 00:23:40,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gluttony

305
00:23:40,602 --> 00:23:42,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was found behind the same refrigerator...

306

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}written in grease.

307
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are 7 deadly sins, Captain.

308

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was the funniest guy I've ever met.

415
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:51,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

416
00:34:54,532 --> 00:34:56,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's kind of rare nowadays.

417
00:34:57,032 --> 00:35:00,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, that level of... commitment.

418
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:06,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, don't worry.

419
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't wear it to the dinner table.

420
00:35:11,212 --> 00:35:12,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No matter...

421
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:16,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how often I see guns, I just can't... get used to them.

422
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Same here.

423
00:35:29,322 --> 00:35:31,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why aren't you married, William? - Tracy.

424
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:33,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell?

425
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:35,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was close once.

426
00:35:36,132 --> 00:35:37,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It just didn't happen.

427
00:35:37,462 --> 00:35:39,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It surprises me.

428
00:35:40,032 --> 00:35:41,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It really does.

429
00:35:43,002 --> 00:35:44,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

430
00:35:45,502 --> 00:35:47,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}anyone who spends a significant

431
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:49,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}amount of time with me finds me disagreeable.

432
00:35:50,572 --> 00:35:51,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just ask your husband.

433
00:35:52,072 --> 00:35:53,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very true.

434
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very, very true.

435
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:58,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how long have you lived here?

436
00:35:59,012 --> 00:36:00,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too long.

437
00:36:04,082 --> 00:36:05,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you like it?

438
00:36:07,352 --> 00:36:08,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know...

439
00:36:09,022 --> 00:36:11,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}takes time. Settle in...

440
00:36:12,592 --> 00:36:14,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll be good.

441
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:16,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you get numb after a while

442
00:36:17,762 --> 00:36:19,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are things to any city...

443
00:36:25,442 --> 00:36:26,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The subway.

444
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:29,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll go away in a minute.

445
00:36:32,872 --> 00:36:34,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This real estate guy.

446
00:36:35,212 --> 00:36:37,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fucking piece of... sorry, honey.

447
00:36:38,682 --> 00:36:41,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He shows us the place a few times, I think he's good.

448
00:36:42,052 --> 00:36:44,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's efficient. Tracy really likes him.

449
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:47,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I start wondering why he'll only bring us here

450
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:49,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for 5 minutes at a time here.

451
00:36:49,562 --> 00:36:51,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We found out the first night.

452
00:36:51,892 --> 00:36:54,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The soothing, relaxing...

453
00:36:54,732 --> 00:36:56,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}vibrating home, huh?

454
00:37:05,072 --> 00:37:06,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

455
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:15,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, alright, laugh it up.

456
00:37:18,252 --> 00:37:20,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know why you're laughing.

457
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:26,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright, already.

458
00:37:30,222 --> 00:37:31,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The guy had to get into the building...

459
00:37:31,992 --> 00:37:35,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before the office was closed and the security tight.

460
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:36,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gould would have been working late.

461
00:37:36,592 --> 00:37:38,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm certain.

462
00:37:38,272 --> 00:37:39,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was the biggest defense lawyer in town.

463
00:37:39,862 --> 00:37:43,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Infamous, really. - Body was found on tuesday morning.

464
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The office was closed on Monday.

465
00:37:45,322 --> 00:37:47,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which means he could have gotten in on Friday.

466
00:37:47,842 --> 00:37:50,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Laid low till the cleaning crew left, then had...

467
00:37:50,372 --> 00:37:54,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}his way with Gould Saturday, Sunday, maybe Monday.

468
00:37:54,912 --> 00:37:55,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at this.

469
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:59,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gould was bound, right arm free.

470
00:37:59,182 --> 00:38:00,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was handed a butcher's knife.

471
00:38:02,852 --> 00:38:04,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check out the scale.

472
00:38:04,822 --> 00:38:06,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A pound of flesh.

473
00:38:12,862 --> 00:38:14,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"One pound of flesh"

474
00:38:14,362 --> 00:38:16,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"no more no less no cartilage...

475
00:38:16,932 --> 00:38:18,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}no bone....

476
00:38:18,202 --> 00:38:20,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but only flesh". "Merchant of Venice."

477
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:21,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't see it.

478
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:25,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"His task done... and he would go free".

479
00:38:25,642 --> 00:38:27,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tell you that chair was...

480
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:30,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- soaked through with sweat. - Of course.

481
00:38:30,712 --> 00:38:33,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The killer would have wanted Gould to take his time...

482
00:38:33,982 --> 00:38:37,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}deciding which cut to make first.

483
00:38:37,812 --> 00:38:39,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Imagine it.

484
00:38:39,282 --> 00:38:41,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a gun in your face.

485
00:38:41,782 --> 00:38:44,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which part of your body is expendable?

486
00:38:44,752 --> 00:38:46,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about the love handle?

487
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cut along the side of his own stomach.

488
00:38:50,062 --> 00:38:52,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, let's take a fresh look at these.

489
00:38:52,762 --> 00:38:54,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even though the corpse isn't there, but...

490
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}look through it. Edit out your initial shock.

491
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:02,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The trick is to find one item, one detail and focus on it...

492
00:39:03,002 --> 00:39:05,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}until it's an exhausted possibility.

493
00:39:05,502 --> 00:39:07,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to get another beer. Beer?

494
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:09,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wine, please.

495
00:39:18,252 --> 00:39:19,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's preaching.

496
00:39:20,252 --> 00:39:21,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Punishing.

497
00:39:23,522 --> 00:39:26,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sins were used in medieval sermons.

498
00:39:27,352 --> 00:39:30,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The 7 cardinal virtues, and the 7 deadly sins...

00:39:30,392 --> 00:39:32,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- used as teaching tools. - Yeah. Like in...

500
00:39:32,862 --> 00:39:36,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- "The Parson's Tale," and Dante. - You read them?

501
00:39:36,662 --> 00:39:37,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

502
00:39:37,862 --> 00:39:41,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Parts. Hey, remember in "Purgatory"...

503
00:39:41,692 --> 00:39:44,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dante and his buddy climb up the hill

504
00:39:44,112 --> 00:39:45,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and check out all the sinners?

505
00:39:46,072 --> 00:39:49,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The seven terraces of purgation. - Yeah, right.

506
00:39:49,812 --> 00:39:53,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there pride comes first, not gluttony.

507
00:39:53,242 --> 00:39:54,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For now let's consider...

508
00:39:54,782 --> 00:39:57,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the books as the killer's inspiration.

509
00:39:57,882 --> 00:40:00,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sermons were about atonement for sin.

510
00:40:00,922 --> 00:40:03,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These murders are like forced attrition.

511
00:40:03,382 --> 00:40:04,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forced what?

512
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:07,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Attrition's when you regret your sins,

513
00:40:07,702 --> 00:40:09,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but not because you love god.

514
00:40:09,682 --> 00:40:12,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because someone put a fucking gun in your face.

515
00:40:15,962 --> 00:40:17,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No fingerprints.

516
00:40:17,232 --> 00:40:18,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nope.

517
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:21,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Totally unrelated victims. - Yep.

518
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:24,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And no witnesses of any kind.

519
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:26,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which I don't get...

520
00:40:26,502 --> 00:40:29,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because the fucker had to get back out.

521
00:40:30,312 --> 00:40:34,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In any major city, minding your own business is a science.

522
00:40:35,342 --> 00:40:37,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The first thing they teach women in rape prevention,

523
00:40:37,262 --> 00:40:39,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is never cry for help.

524
00:40:39,712 --> 00:40:41,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Always yell, "fire!".

525
00:40:41,422 --> 00:40:42,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody answers help.

526
00:40:42,922 --> 00:40:44,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You holler "fire," they'll come around.

527
00:40:45,022 --> 00:40:46,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's fucked up.

528
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:49,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He must have left another puzzle piece.

529
00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:54,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? Thank you for talking this out,

530
00:40:54,772 --> 00:40:55,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I got to sleep.

531
00:40:56,362 --> 00:40:57,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walk the dogs.

532
00:40:57,702 --> 00:41:00,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is just to satisfy my curiosity.

533
00:41:00,302 --> 00:41:01,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm still leaving at the end of the week.

534
00:41:01,982 --> 00:41:04,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit. No, wait, wait.

535
00:41:05,872 --> 00:41:08,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gould's wife. She was out of town at the time.

536
00:41:08,942 --> 00:41:12,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So this means she saw something. - What if it's a threat?

537
00:41:12,342 --> 00:41:16,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I put her in a safe house. She wasn't too happy about it.

538
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:26,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if it isn't something she has seen...

539
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:29,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but something she's supposed to see

540
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:31,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but hasn't been giving the chance?

541
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:33,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, okay. What?

542
00:41:33,162 --> 00:41:34,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

543
00:41:36,502 --> 00:41:38,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's the one thing.

544
00:42:23,872 --> 00:42:25,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sign us in.

545
00:42:25,672 --> 00:42:27,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got to see Mrs. Gould.

546
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We want you to have a phone line, but...

547
00:42:33,912 --> 00:42:35,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Gould?

548
00:42:41,452 --> 00:42:43,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Gould, I'm sorry. I truly am.

549
00:42:44,722 --> 00:42:46,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand.

550
00:42:46,922 --> 00:42:49,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I need you to look at each photo...

551
00:42:50,092 --> 00:42:51,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}very carefully.

552
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:55,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look and see if there's anything strange or...

553
00:42:55,432 --> 00:42:58,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}out of place, anything at all.

554
00:42:58,962 --> 00:43:01,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't see anything. - You sure?

555
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:03,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, I can't do this right now.

556
00:43:03,972 --> 00:43:05,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

557
00:43:06,202 --> 00:43:07,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's got to be now.

558
00:43:07,802 --> 00:43:09,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There may be something we haven't seen.

559
00:43:19,282 --> 00:43:20,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait.

560
00:43:20,552 --> 00:43:21,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

561
00:43:21,622 --> 00:43:22,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here.

562
00:43:26,152 --> 00:43:29,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This painting, it's upside down.

563
00:43:37,002 --> 00:43:39,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You sure your men didn't move this? - No.

564
00:43:39,132 --> 00:43:41,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those shots were taken before forensics.

565
00:43:44,972 --> 00:43:46,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing.

566
00:43:47,342 --> 00:43:49,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's got to be something.

567
00:44:00,282 --> 00:44:02,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He moved the screws to rehang it. - Yep.

568
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:08,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck is that?

569
00:44:10,322 --> 00:44:11,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Switchblade.

570
00:44:19,932 --> 00:44:21,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God damn it.

571
00:44:25,002 --> 00:44:27,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There must be something.

572
00:44:32,642 --> 00:44:34,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He didn't paint the fucking thing.

573
00:44:42,622 --> 00:44:45,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now he's fucking with us, that's what he's doing.

574
00:44:46,822 --> 00:44:49,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See this, this is us.

575
00:44:51,592 --> 00:44:53,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just wait a minute.

576
00:44:55,262 --> 00:44:58,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Somerset's climbing on the furniture. - Just wait a minute.

577
00:45:04,142 --> 00:45:06,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're kidding me.

578
00:45:06,102 --> 00:45:08,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Call the print lab.

579
00:45:13,312 --> 00:45:14,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, man.

580
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:19,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honestly...

581
00:45:19,682 --> 00:45:22,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}have you ever seen anything like this?

582
00:45:23,962 --> 00:45:26,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

583
00:45:26,452 --> 00:45:28,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help me

584
00:45:28,122 --> 00:45:29,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can tell you guys,

585
00:45:29,342 --> 00:45:30,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just by looking at the swell pattern

586
00:45:30,922 --> 00:45:33,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they're not the victim's fingerprints.

587
00:45:43,702 --> 00:45:45,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, man.

588
00:45:45,672 --> 00:45:47,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd say he's whacked enough.

589
00:45:49,542 --> 00:45:50,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't fit.

590
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:53,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't want us to help him stop.

591
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:54,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who knows.

592
00:45:54,442 --> 00:45:58,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Freaks out there doing their evil deeds they don't want to do.

593
00:45:58,682 --> 00:46:00,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"The voices made me do it".

594
00:46:00,722 --> 00:46:04,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"My dog made me do it, Jodie Foster made me do it".

595
00:46:04,822 --> 00:46:08,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll say this maybe take as long as 3 days to make a match,

596
00:46:08,002 --> 00:46:10,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so maybe you guys want to cross your fingers somewhere else.

597
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:17,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?

598
00:46:17,302 --> 00:46:19,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}About catching this guy.

599
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:25,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wish I still thought the way you did.

600
00:46:26,672 --> 00:46:30,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me what the hell it is you think we're doing?

601
00:46:30,942 --> 00:46:32,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Picking up the pieces.

602
00:46:34,312 --> 00:46:36,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're collecting all the evidence,

603
00:46:36,782 --> 00:46:39,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}taking all the pictures and samples...

604
00:46:39,252 --> 00:46:41,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}writing everything down...

605
00:46:41,452 --> 00:46:43,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}noting the time things happened.

606
00:46:45,092 --> 00:46:46,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all?

607
00:46:46,822 --> 00:46:48,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all.

608
00:46:48,422 --> 00:46:52,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Putting everything into neat piles and filing it away...

609
00:46:52,762 --> 00:46:56,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on the off chance it'll be needed in the courtroom.

610
00:46:58,962 --> 00:47:02,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Picking up diamonds on a deserted island...

611
00:47:02,302 --> 00:47:05,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}saving them in case we get rescued.

612
00:47:08,512 --> 00:47:09,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bullshit.

613
00:47:12,312 --> 00:47:16,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even the most promising clues usually only lead to others.

614
00:47:17,512 --> 00:47:20,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So many corpses roll away unrevenged.

615
00:47:23,892 --> 00:47:27,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't try to tell me you didn't get that rush tonight.

616
00:47:28,622 --> 00:47:30,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw you.

617
00:47:30,992 --> 00:47:32,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're getting somewhere.

618

00:47:48,512 --> 00:47:50,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wake up, glimmer twins.

620

652
00:49:39,902 --> 00:49:42,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was pretty shaky going in. I was a rookie then.

653
00:49:43,142 --> 00:49:45,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway, we bust open the door looking for this junkie,

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A year of immobility's right,

724
00:55:26,762 --> 00:55:30,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}judging by the deterioration of the muscle and spine.

725
00:55:30,162 --> 00:55:33,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blood tests show a smorgasbord of drugs in his system.

726
00:55:33,902 --> 00:55:36,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even an antibiotic,

727
00:55:36,092 --> 00:55:38,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}probably to keep the bedsores from infecting.

728
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:43,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, has he tried to speak or communicate in any way?

729
00:55:43,572 --> 00:55:46,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even if his brain were not mush, which it is...

730
00:55:46,512 --> 00:55:49,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he chewed off his tongue long ago.

731
00:55:51,512 --> 00:55:52,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doc.

732
00:55:53,682 --> 00:55:56,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there absolutely no chance that he might survive?

733
00:55:57,522 --> 00:56:00,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'd die of shock right now

734
00:56:00,452 --> 00:56:02,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you shone a flashlight in his eyes.

735
00:56:03,022 --> 00:56:06,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's experience about as much pain and suffering

736
00:56:06,152 --> 00:56:07,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as anyone I've encountered, give or take

737
00:56:08,922 --> 00:56:11,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he still has hell to look forward to.

738
00:56:11,932 --> 00:56:13,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night.

739
00:56:26,212 --> 00:56:27,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, William.

740
00:56:27,942 --> 00:56:29,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Tracy.

741
00:56:30,112 --> 00:56:31,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tracy?

742
00:56:31,812 --> 00:56:32,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything okay?

743
00:56:33,282 --> 00:56:36,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Yes, everything's fine.

744
00:56:36,212 --> 00:56:37,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's David?

745
00:56:37,422 --> 00:56:40,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's in the other room. He's in the shower.

746
00:56:40,792 --> 00:56:43,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry to call you like this.

747
00:56:43,892 --> 00:56:45,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, it's all right.

748
00:56:46,392 --> 00:56:47,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What can I do for you Tracy?

749
00:56:53,462 --> 00:56:55,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need someone to talk...to...

750
00:56:55,562 --> 00:56:58,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think you could meet me...

751
00:56:58,572 --> 00:57:00,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}somewhere, maybe tomorrow morning?

752
00:57:01,802 --> 00:57:03,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand.

753
00:57:04,642 --> 00:57:07,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel stupid calling, but...

754
00:57:08,812 --> 00:57:11,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're the only person that I know here.

755
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:13,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no one else.

756
00:57:14,252 --> 00:57:15,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you can...

757
00:57:15,912 --> 00:57:18,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just give me a call, okay?

758
00:57:18,482 --> 00:57:20,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to go now.

759
00:57:20,982 --> 00:57:22,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night.

760
00:57:22,152 --> 00:57:23,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night.

761
00:57:27,992 --> 00:57:30,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Friday

762
00:57:32,692 --> 00:57:33,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean...

763
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:36,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you know this city so well.

764
00:57:37,362 --> 00:57:38,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've been here...

765
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so long.

766
00:57:42,172 --> 00:57:43,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It can be a hard place.

767
00:57:44,372 --> 00:57:46,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know why I asked you to come.

768
00:57:48,512 --> 00:57:50,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you talk to him about it?

769
00:57:51,012 --> 00:57:52,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell him how you feel.

770
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't. You know, I can't be a burden.

771
00:57:56,952 --> 00:57:58,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Especially now.

772
00:58:00,692 --> 00:58:02,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll get used to things...

773
00:58:02,852 --> 00:58:04,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know?

774
00:58:04,122 --> 00:58:06,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted to talk to someone...

775
00:58:06,792 --> 00:58:09,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who's lived here for a long time.

776
00:58:09,762 --> 00:58:15,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, upstate, it's a completely different environment.

777
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:23,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did david tell you that I teach fifth grade? Well, I did.

778
00:58:24,812 --> 00:58:26,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, he mentioned it.

779
00:58:29,812 --> 00:58:32,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been going around, looking at schools...

780
00:58:35,052 --> 00:58:37,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but the conditions here are...

781
00:58:37,552 --> 00:58:38,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}horrible.

782
00:58:40,822 --> 00:58:42,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about private schools?

783
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:45,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

784
00:58:47,892 --> 00:58:50,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you, Tracy?

785
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:55,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}David and I are going to have a baby.

786
00:59:00,672 --> 00:59:01,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Tracy. I...

787
00:59:03,502 --> 00:59:06,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think I'm the one to talk to...

788
00:59:07,012 --> 00:59:09,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- about this. - I hate this city.

789
00:59:14,082 --> 00:59:16,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had a relationship once...

790
00:59:16,752 --> 00:59:19,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was very much like a marriage.

791
00:59:21,922 --> 00:59:23,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got pregnant.

792
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:26,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was a long time ago.

793
00:59:32,692 --> 00:59:35,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember getting up one morning and going to work.

794
00:59:37,772 --> 00:59:40,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a day like any other,

795
00:59:40,102 --> 00:59:41,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}except it was the first day after I knew...

796
00:59:41,902 --> 00:59:44,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about the pregnancy.

797
00:59:45,772 --> 00:59:48,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I felt this fear...

798
00:59:48,712 --> 00:59:50,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the first time ever.

799
00:59:53,052 --> 00:59:54,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember thinking...

800
00:59:55,252 --> 00:59:58,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how can I bring a child into a world like this?

801
00:59:58,622 --> 01:00:01,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can a person grow up with all this around them?

802
01:00:09,232 --> 01:00:11,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told her I didn't want to have it.

803
01:00:13,732 --> 01:00:15,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And over the next few weeks...

804
01:00:16,902 --> 01:00:18,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wore her down.

805
01:00:21,402 --> 01:00:23,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to have children.

806
01:00:27,972 --> 01:00:30,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can tell you now that...

807
01:00:30,912 --> 01:00:33,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know... I mean...

808
01:00:35,152 --> 01:00:37,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm positive that...

809
01:00:37,152 --> 01:00:39,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I made the right decision.

810
01:00:39,922 --> 01:00:43,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But not a day passes that I don't wish...

811
01:00:43,492 --> 01:00:45,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that I had made a different choice.

812
01:00:49,492 --> 01:00:50,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you don't...

813
01:00:50,992 --> 01:00:52,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}keep...

814
01:00:53,432 --> 01:00:56,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the baby, I mean, if that's your decision...

815
01:00:58,672 --> 01:01:01,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}don't ever tell him you were pregnant.

816
01:01:02,842 --> 01:01:05,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you choose to have the baby...

817
01:01:06,612 --> 01:01:09,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then spoil that kid every chance you get.

818
01:01:16,852 --> 01:01:21,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's... about... all the advice I can give you, Tracy.

819
01:01:28,692 --> 01:01:30,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotto go.

820
01:01:30,632 --> 01:01:31,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}William.

821
01:01:38,972 --> 01:01:40,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

822
01:01:46,642 --> 01:01:54,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gluttony. Greed. Sloth. Envy. Wrath. Pride. Lust.

823
01:01:54,482 --> 01:01:58,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Victor's landlord said there was cash in the office maibox

824
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:00,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the first of every month.

825

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No pay stubs. No appointment books. No addresses.

1033
01:20:46,662 --> 01:20:47,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the best we got.

1034
01:20:47,932 --> 01:20:50,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You guys keep looking on it! - Let me show you something

1035
01:20:50,102 --> 01:20:53,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was under the bed. His only source of funds?

1036
01:20:53,102 --> 01:20:55,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got his money. Fucking-A. I like it.

1037
01:20:55,432 --> 01:20:56,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. And there is one more thing.

1038
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:58,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're probably not gonna believe this.

1039
01:20:58,282 --> 01:21:01,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We haven't found a fingerprint. Not one.

1040
01:21:01,152 --> 01:21:04,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are right. I don't believe you. Keep looking.

1041
01:21:08,792 --> 01:21:10,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could use more men here.

1042
01:21:10,452 --> 01:21:11,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm doing the best I can.

1043
01:21:12,452 --> 01:21:13,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get all these?

1044
01:21:13,792 --> 01:21:16,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are 2,000 notebooks on these shelves.

1045
01:21:16,092 --> 01:21:19,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And each notebook contains about 250 pages.

1046
01:21:19,192 --> 01:21:20,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forget it. Anything about the killings?

1047
01:21:22,202 --> 01:21:23,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"What sick ridiculous puppets we are,

1048
01:21:23,862 --> 01:21:26,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what a gross little stage we dance on.

1049
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:28,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What fun we have, dancing and fucking.

1050
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:32,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not a care in the world. Not knowing that we're nothing.

1051
01:21:32,542 --> 01:21:34,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are not what was intended."

1052
01:21:34,972 --> 01:21:36,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, there's a lot more.

1053
01:21:38,212 --> 01:21:39,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"On the subway today,

1054
01:21:39,362 --> 01:21:41,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a man came up to me and start a conversation.

1055
01:21:42,552 --> 01:21:43,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He made small talk,

1056
01:21:43,902 --> 01:21:46,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a lonely man talking about the weather and things.

1057
01:21:46,482 --> 01:21:48,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried to be pleasant and accommodating...

1058
01:21:48,722 --> 01:21:51,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But my head began to hurt from his banality.

1059
01:21:51,722 --> 01:21:53,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I almost didn't notice it had happened...

1060
01:21:53,962 --> 01:21:56,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I suddenly threw up all over him.

1061
01:21:56,892 --> 01:21:58,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was not pleased.

1062
01:21:59,232 --> 01:22:01,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I couldn't stop laughing".

1063
01:22:02,662 --> 01:22:04,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No dates.

1064
01:22:04,232 --> 01:22:07,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Placed on the shelves in no discernible order.

1065
01:22:08,402 --> 01:22:10,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just his mind poured out on paper.

1066
01:22:11,742 --> 01:22:13,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like a life's work.

1067
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts, it'd still

1068
01:22:17,012 --> 01:22:19,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- take 2 months. - I know.

1069
01:22:22,632 --> 01:22:23,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's that phone?

1070
01:22:27,352 --> 01:22:29,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Phone? Phone? Phone? Phone?

1071
01:22:33,262 --> 01:22:34,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People, quiet!

1072
01:22:51,102 --> 01:22:52,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I admire you.

1073
01:22:53,712 --> 01:22:56,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know how you found me, but I was surprised!

1074
01:22:58,042 --> 01:23:01,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I respect you law enforcement officers more every day.

1075
01:23:01,612 --> 01:23:04,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I appreciate that, John.

1076
01:23:04,552 --> 01:23:06,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I tell you. - No, you listen.

1077
01:23:06,382 --> 01:23:10,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be re-adjusting my schedule in light of today's setback.

1078
01:23:10,722 --> 01:23:13,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just had to call and express my admiration.

1079
01:23:13,092 --> 01:23:16,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, I had to hurt one of you,

1080
01:23:16,632 --> 01:23:18,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I didn't really have a choice, did I?

1081
01:23:19,232 --> 01:23:20,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll accept my apology, will you?

1082
01:23:20,732 --> 01:23:24,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel like to say more but that'd ruin the surprise.

1083
01:23:31,142 --> 01:23:32,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got it.

1084
01:23:36,982 --> 01:23:38,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody back to work.

1085
01:23:40,912 --> 01:23:42,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were right.

1086
01:23:42,982 --> 01:23:44,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's preaching.

1087
01:23:46,582 --> 01:23:48,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These murders are his sermons to us.

1088
01:23:49,052 --> 01:23:51,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, we know him. We know him. We know him.

1089
01:23:55,092 --> 01:23:56,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's the blonde?

1090
01:24:01,132 --> 01:24:02,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like a pro.

1091
01:24:02,802 --> 01:24:03,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe.

1092
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:06,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She caught John Doe's eye.

1093
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:11,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wild Bill's Leather

1094
01:24:11,842 --> 01:24:15,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He came and collected it last night. - Last night?

1095
01:24:15,512 --> 01:24:17,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. - This man?

1096
01:24:17,282 --> 01:24:20,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John Doe, easy name to remember. He had a limp.

1097
01:24:20,342 --> 01:24:24,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's the job you did for him? - I've got a picture.

1098
01:24:24,322 --> 01:24:26,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One sweet piece, actually.

1099
01:24:26,482 --> 01:24:28,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought he was one of them performance artists.

1100
01:24:28,662 --> 01:24:29,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least what I thought.

1101
01:24:29,622 --> 01:24:31,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know the sort of guy that

1102
01:24:31,352 --> 01:24:35,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}pisses in a cup on stage and then drinks it.

1103
01:24:35,762 --> 01:24:36,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Performance art.

1104
01:24:37,162 --> 01:24:38,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

1105
01:24:41,332 --> 01:24:43,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I undercharged him actually.

1106
01:24:43,702 --> 01:24:45,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You made this for him?

1107
01:24:45,532 --> 01:24:47,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've made weirder shit than that. So what?

1108
01:24:53,612 --> 01:24:55,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They found the blonde.

1109
01:24:58,342 --> 01:24:59,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The picture!

1110
01:24:59,842 --> 01:25:01,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The picture!

1111
01:25:02,612 --> 01:25:04,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fucking pigs.

1112
01:25:06,282 --> 01:25:09,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I need you to move now. - I'll come out, but you guys

1113
01:25:09,292 --> 01:25:11,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the fuck out of the booth, pal!

1114
01:25:11,692 --> 01:25:13,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been in this cage the whole time.

1115
01:25:15,192 --> 01:25:16,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, this way.

1116
01:25:23,632 --> 01:25:26,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you do something about the music?

1117
01:25:26,092 --> 01:25:27,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're looking for the guy.

1118
01:25:40,812 --> 01:25:43,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You from homicide? You better see this.

1119
01:25:43,982 --> 01:25:46,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lust

1120
01:25:53,962 --> 01:25:55,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get this thing off of me.

1121
01:25:56,062 --> 01:25:58,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh God, get it off of me.

1122
01:26:00,332 --> 01:26:01,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him out of here, now!

1123
01:26:03,302 --> 01:26:04,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. I want to hear it again.

1124
01:26:05,302 --> 01:26:06,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me again.

1125
01:26:09,042 --> 01:26:12,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You heard nothing strange, saw nothing strange.

1126
01:26:12,272 --> 01:26:13,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1127
01:26:16,112 --> 01:26:18,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He asked me if I was married.

1128
01:26:18,642 --> 01:26:21,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I could see he had a gun in his... - Where was the girl?

1129
01:26:21,212 --> 01:26:23,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The what? What?

1130
01:26:23,552 --> 01:26:26,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The girl. The prostitute. Where was she?

1131
01:26:26,222 --> 01:26:28,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone comes to your establishment.

1132
01:26:28,792 --> 01:26:32,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They want to go downstairs, get some oo-la-la, whatever.

1133
01:26:33,222 --> 01:26:35,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They got to come to you. Yeah?

1134
01:26:36,062 --> 01:26:37,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1135
01:26:37,132 --> 01:26:38,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't see anyone?

1136
01:26:39,292 --> 01:26:42,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With a package? A knapsack? Something under their arm?

1137
01:26:42,802 --> 01:26:44,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody that comes in there

1138
01:26:44,652 --> 01:26:47,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}has got a package under their arms.

1139
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:50,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some guys are carrying suitcases full of stuff.

1140
01:26:50,902 --> 01:26:52,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was just sitting on the bed.

1141
01:26:59,912 --> 01:27:02,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who tied her down? You or him?

1142
01:27:02,582 --> 01:27:05,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you like what you do for a living?

1143
01:27:05,082 --> 01:27:07,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All these things you see?

1144
01:27:07,152 --> 01:27:10,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, I don't.

1145
01:27:12,322 --> 01:27:14,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's life, isn't it?

1146
01:27:18,762 --> 01:27:23,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He had a gun. And he made it happen.

1147
01:27:26,172 --> 01:27:28,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He made me do it.

1148
01:27:28,672 --> 01:27:31,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He put that thing on me.

1149
01:27:31,912 --> 01:27:34,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he made me wear it.

1150
01:27:34,672 --> 01:27:36,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then he

1151
01:27:36,442 --> 01:27:38,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}told me to fuck her.

1152
01:27:40,112 --> 01:27:42,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I did. I fucked her.

1153
01:27:43,112 --> 01:27:44,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God! Oh, God!

1154
01:27:44,852 --> 01:27:47,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.

1155
01:27:47,952 --> 01:27:50,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fucking gun was in my throat.

1156
01:27:51,022 --> 01:27:52,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck.

1157
01:27:55,122 --> 01:27:57,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God. God.

1158
01:27:57,362 --> 01:28:00,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God, help me. Please, please, help me.

1159
01:28:18,812 --> 01:28:21,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't gonna have a happy ending.

1160
01:28:21,712 --> 01:28:24,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's not possible. - We catch him, I'll be happy enough.

1161
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:30,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we catch John Doe and he turns out to be the devil.

1162
01:28:30,892 --> 01:28:32,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he's Satan himself,

1163
01:28:32,392 --> 01:28:35,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that might live up to our expectations.

1164
01:28:35,892 --> 01:28:37,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he's not the devil.

1165
01:28:38,832 --> 01:28:40,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's just a man.

1166
01:28:41,062 --> 01:28:42,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know.

1167
01:28:42,902 --> 01:28:46,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You bitch and you complain and you tell me these things.

1168
01:28:47,502 --> 01:28:50,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you think you're preparing me for hard times.

1169
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:51,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, but...

1170
01:28:52,342 --> 01:28:54,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you got to be a hero.

1171
01:28:55,582 --> 01:28:57,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to be a champion. Well, I'm gonna tell you.

1172
01:28:57,842 --> 01:29:00,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People don't want a champion. They want to eat cheeseburgers

1173
01:29:00,582 --> 01:29:03,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- play Lotto and watch TV. - How did you get like this?

1174
01:29:03,922 --> 01:29:05,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to know.

1175
01:29:10,022 --> 01:29:12,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It wasn't one thing, I can tell you that.

1176
01:29:14,022 --> 01:29:15,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on.

1177
01:29:18,532 --> 01:29:21,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think I can continue to live in a place

1178
01:29:21,182 --> 01:29:25,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that embraces and nurtures apathy as if it was a virtue.

1179
01:29:25,772 --> 01:29:27,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You aren't different or better.

1180
01:29:27,842 --> 01:29:30,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't say I was. I'm not.

1181
01:29:30,602 --> 01:29:33,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hell, I sympathize. I sympathize completely.

1182
01:29:33,942 --> 01:29:35,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apathy is a solution.

1183
01:29:36,412 --> 01:29:39,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, it's easier to lose yourself in drugs

1184
01:29:39,802 --> 01:29:42,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}than it is to cope with life.

1185
01:29:42,382 --> 01:29:45,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's easier to steal what you want than to earn it.

1186
01:29:45,112 --> 01:29:47,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's easier to beat a child than to raise it.

1187
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:50,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Love costs. It takes effort, work.

1188
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:53,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are talking about people who are mentally ill...

1189
01:29:53,762 --> 01:29:56,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are talking about people fucking crazies.

1190
01:29:56,232 --> 01:29:57,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, we're not. - Yes, today.

1191
01:29:57,892 --> 01:30:01,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we're talking about everyday life here.

1192
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:04,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't afford to be this naive.

1193
01:30:04,802 --> 01:30:06,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck off.

1194
01:30:06,632 --> 01:30:08,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, you...

1195
01:30:08,242 --> 01:30:10,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should listen to yourself.

1196
01:30:10,242 --> 01:30:12,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. You say that

1197
01:30:12,412 --> 01:30:14,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the problem with people is they don't care.

1198
01:30:15,742 --> 01:30:17,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I don't care about people.

1199
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:19,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That makes no sense. You know why?

1200
01:30:19,812 --> 01:30:21,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You care?

1201
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:23,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Want to know... damn right.

1202
01:30:23,252 --> 01:30:24,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll make a difference.

1203
01:30:24,922 --> 01:30:27,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever. The point is that

1204
01:30:27,492 --> 01:30:30,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think you're quitting because you believe

1205
01:30:30,492 --> 01:30:32,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}these things you say.

1206
01:30:32,492 --> 01:30:34,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to believe them,

1207
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:35,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because you're quitting.

1208
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:41,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you want me to agree with you and say "you're right,

1209
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:42,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all fucked up.

1210
01:30:42,432 --> 01:30:43,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a fucking mess.

1211
01:30:43,752 --> 01:30:46,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should all go live in a fucking log cabin."

1212
01:30:47,502 --> 01:30:48,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I won't.

1213
01:30:49,702 --> 01:30:51,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't say that.

1214
01:30:52,742 --> 01:30:55,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't agree with you. I do not.

1215
01:30:59,112 --> 01:30:59,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't.

1216
01:31:10,352 --> 01:31:11,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna go home.

1217
01:31:20,032 --> 01:31:21,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, though.

1218
01:31:51,822 --> 01:31:53,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you.

1219
01:31:54,222 --> 01:31:55,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So much.

1220
01:32:03,902 --> 01:32:05,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

1221
01:33:05,422 --> 01:33:07,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sunday

1222
01:33:07,722 --> 01:33:09,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your emergency?

1223
01:33:11,062 --> 01:33:12,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you repeat that?

1224
01:33:12,152 --> 01:33:15,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've gone and done it again.

1225
01:33:22,502 --> 01:33:25,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pride

1226
01:33:25,672 --> 01:33:27,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have we got?

1227
01:33:27,172 --> 01:33:29,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sleeping pills.

1228
01:33:30,342 --> 01:33:32,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Glued to one hand.

1229
01:33:32,172 --> 01:33:33,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Telephone glued to the other.

1230
01:33:35,382 --> 01:33:36,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see what he did?

1231
01:33:37,582 --> 01:33:39,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He sliced her up.

1232
01:33:39,512 --> 01:33:41,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then he bandaged her.

1233
01:33:41,512 --> 01:33:43,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Call for help and you'll live.

1234
01:33:43,852 --> 01:33:45,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you'll be disfigured.

1235
01:33:47,182 --> 01:33:50,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or put yourself out of your own misery.

1236
01:33:51,192 --> 01:33:52,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

1237
01:33:52,522 --> 01:33:53,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He cut off her nose.

1238
01:33:54,022 --> 01:33:55,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To spite her face.

1239
01:33:55,862 --> 01:33:57,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he did it very recently.

1240
01:34:05,432 --> 01:34:06,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen...

1241
01:34:07,542 --> 01:34:10,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've decided to stay on till this is done.

1242
01:34:10,602 --> 01:34:14,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of two things'll happen. Either we'll get John Doe,

1243
01:34:14,542 --> 01:34:17,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or he'll kill 7 and this case will go on for years.

1244
01:34:17,712 --> 01:34:21,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have to do me any favors. Thank you, but I got it.

1245
01:34:21,112 --> 01:34:24,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm asking to keep me as your partner for a few more days.

1246
01:34:24,192 --> 01:34:25,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'd be doing me a favor.

1247
01:34:36,962 --> 01:34:39,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You knew I'd say Yes. We're here.

1248
01:34:40,132 --> 01:34:43,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your wife called. Get yourself an answering machine.

1249
01:34:46,142 --> 01:34:47,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Detective.

1250
01:34:48,972 --> 01:34:50,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After this I'm gone.

1251
01:34:51,472 --> 01:34:54,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No big surprise. - Detective!

1252
01:34:57,082 --> 01:34:58,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're looking for me.

1253
01:35:01,382 --> 01:35:02,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't fucking move.

1254
01:35:02,482 --> 01:35:03,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On the fucking floor.

1255
01:35:03,952 --> 01:35:06,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stay away from him - On the fucking floor.

1256
01:35:06,152 --> 01:35:07,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you.

1257
01:35:07,422 --> 01:35:08,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now. Get down.

1258
01:35:09,322 --> 01:35:10,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get down on your stomach.

1259
01:35:11,022 --> 01:35:12,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You piece of shit. Now!

1260
01:35:13,122 --> 01:35:14,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the way. All the way.

1261
01:35:14,962 --> 01:35:16,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fucker. Down.

1262
01:35:16,532 --> 01:35:17,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Faster.

1263
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:20,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Faster, fucker. Now.

1264
01:35:20,202 --> 01:35:21,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nose on the ground.

1265
01:35:25,202 --> 01:35:28,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?

1266
01:35:28,372 --> 01:35:31,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to speak to my lawyer, please.

1267
01:35:33,242 --> 01:35:34,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God damn it.

1268
01:35:36,812 --> 01:35:39,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He cuts the skin off the tips of his fingers.

1269
01:35:39,512 --> 01:35:40,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why we couldn't find

1270
01:35:40,872 --> 01:35:43,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one single usable print in his apartment.

1271
01:35:43,722 --> 01:35:45,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seems he's been doing it for quite some time.

1272
01:35:46,052 --> 01:35:48,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the trace on his bank accounts? The guns?

1273
01:35:48,722 --> 01:35:50,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So far everything is a dead end.

1274
01:35:50,892 --> 01:35:53,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No credit history. No employment records.

1275
01:35:53,722 --> 01:35:55,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His bank account's only 5-years old

1276
01:35:55,812 --> 01:35:56,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it was started with cash.

1277
01:35:56,992 --> 01:35:59,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're even trying to trace his furniture.

1278
01:35:59,402 --> 01:36:02,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the only thing we know about that guy right now...

1279
01:36:02,452 --> 01:36:03,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is that he's independently wealthy,

1280
01:36:04,232 --> 01:36:05,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}well-educated,

1281
01:36:05,672 --> 01:36:07,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and totally insane.

1282
01:36:07,172 --> 01:36:09,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because he's John Doe by choice.

1283
01:36:10,212 --> 01:36:11,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When can we question him?

1284
01:36:11,362 --> 01:36:14,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't. He goes to court now.

1285
01:36:14,242 --> 01:36:17,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no way he'd just turn himself in.

1286
01:36:17,212 --> 01:36:18,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't make any sense.

1287
01:36:18,512 --> 01:36:19,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he sits.

1288
01:36:19,752 --> 01:36:22,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not supposed to make any sense.

1289
01:36:22,182 --> 01:36:23,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not finished.

1290
01:36:23,522 --> 01:36:26,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's pissing in our faces and we're taking it like idiots.

1291
01:36:27,252 --> 01:36:29,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what I'm talking about.

1292
01:36:29,352 --> 01:36:33,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For the first time ever, you and I are in total agreement.

1293
01:36:33,422 --> 01:36:34,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wouldn't just stop.

1294
01:36:35,032 --> 01:36:37,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what the fuck, man?

1295
01:36:37,092 --> 01:36:40,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's 2 murders away from completing his masterpiece.

1296
01:36:41,772 --> 01:36:43,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll wait for his plea.

1297
01:36:47,172 --> 01:36:49,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My client says there're 2 more bodies.

1298
01:36:49,212 --> 01:36:51,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two more victims hidden away.

1299
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:55,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He will take Detectives Mills and Somerset to these bodies,

1300
01:36:55,002 --> 01:36:56,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but only Detectives Mills and Somerset...

1301
01:36:56,882 --> 01:36:58,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and only at 6 o'clock today.

1302
01:36:59,052 --> 01:37:00,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why us?

1303
01:37:00,782 --> 01:37:02,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He says he admires you.

1304
01:37:03,882 --> 01:37:05,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's part of the game.

1305
01:37:05,722 --> 01:37:06,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The client claims that

1306
01:37:06,672 --> 01:37:08,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if the Detectives do not accept this offer,

1307
01:37:08,422 --> 01:37:09,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}these bodies will never be found.

1308
01:37:10,062 --> 01:37:12,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frankly, counsel, I'm inclined to let them rot.

1309
01:37:14,062 --> 01:37:15,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got him.

1310
01:37:15,562 --> 01:37:18,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Downstairs, locked up. Done deal.

1311
01:37:18,562 --> 01:37:19,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll get his free room and board,

1312
01:37:19,992 --> 01:37:21,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he's gonna get free cable TV.

1313
01:37:21,132 --> 01:37:23,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My wife doesn't even have cable.

1314
01:37:23,352 --> 01:37:24,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are we having this conversation?

1315
01:37:24,682 --> 01:37:27,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Something stinks.

1316
01:37:27,482 --> 01:37:31,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this one here... you, in your $3,000 suit,

1317
01:37:31,442 --> 01:37:32,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that smug smile on your face.

1318
01:37:32,802 --> 01:37:34,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dealing for that piece of shit.

1319
01:37:34,082 --> 01:37:35,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't like it. -Mills

1320
01:37:35,382 --> 01:37:37,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am required by law to serve my clients,

1321
01:37:37,382 --> 01:37:40,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my clients and serve their best interest.

1322
01:37:40,982 --> 01:37:43,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.

1323
01:37:43,252 --> 01:37:44,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My client also wishes to inform you that

1324
01:37:44,822 --> 01:37:47,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you do not accept, he'll plead insanity across the board.

1325
01:37:48,422 --> 01:37:49,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let him try it.

1326
01:37:50,562 --> 01:37:51,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to see him try it.

1327
01:37:51,822 --> 01:37:53,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Now we all know with

1328
01:37:53,532 --> 01:37:55,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the extreme nature of these crimes,

1329
01:37:55,032 --> 01:37:57,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can get him off with such a plea.

1330
01:37:57,332 --> 01:37:59,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't let this conviction slide. I can tell you that.

1331
01:37:59,962 --> 01:38:03,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said that if you do accept under his specific conditions,

1332
01:38:03,972 --> 01:38:06,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he'll sign a full confession, plead guilty right now.

1333
01:38:07,172 --> 01:38:09,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your case. Make a decision.

1334
01:38:11,012 --> 01:38:12,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Full confession.

1335
01:38:12,672 --> 01:38:13,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm in.

1336
01:38:13,942 --> 01:38:15,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It must be both of you.

1337
01:38:17,112 --> 01:38:19,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he were to claim insanity,

1338
01:38:19,452 --> 01:38:22,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this conversation is admissible

1339
01:38:22,682 --> 01:38:24,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the fact that he's blackmailing us with his plea.

1340
01:38:24,852 --> 01:38:27,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My client would like to remind you, 2 more are dead.

1341
01:38:27,952 --> 01:38:30,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The press'd have a field day out if they had found out

1342
01:38:30,422 --> 01:38:32,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the police didn't seem to concerned about finding them

1343
01:38:32,502 --> 01:38:33,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}giving them a proper burial.

1344
01:38:33,962 --> 01:38:36,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If in fact there are 2 more dead.

1345
01:38:36,192 --> 01:38:37,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The lab report came from downtown.

1346
01:38:37,932 --> 01:38:40,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They did a quickie on Doe's clothing and fingernails.

1347
01:38:40,702 --> 01:38:43,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They found blood from Doe's, from slicing his fingers,

1348
01:38:43,972 --> 01:38:46,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}blood from the woman who's face he cut off,

1349
01:38:47,292 --> 01:38:49,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and blood from a third party.

1350
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:51,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As yet unidentified.

1351
01:38:54,712 --> 01:38:57,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'd be escorting an unarmed man.

1352
01:38:59,982 --> 01:39:01,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's finish it.

1353
01:39:05,322 --> 01:39:08,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If John Doe's head splits open and a UFO flies out,

1354
01:39:08,422 --> 01:39:10,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to expect it.

1355
01:39:12,662 --> 01:39:13,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will.

1356
01:39:16,732 --> 01:39:19,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey man, if I accidentally shaved off a nipple,

1357
01:39:19,672 --> 01:39:21,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}would it be covered by workman's comp?

1358
01:39:26,172 --> 01:39:27,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I suppose so.

1359
01:39:29,242 --> 01:39:32,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you were man enough to file a claim,

1360
01:39:32,172 --> 01:39:34,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.

1361
01:39:36,012 --> 01:39:39,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I keep coming home late, my wife'll think something's up.

1362
01:39:48,252 --> 01:39:49,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know...

1363
01:39:50,762 --> 01:39:51,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1364
01:39:57,862 --> 01:39:58,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1365
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:10,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will this wind hurt us?

1366
01:41:10,762 --> 01:41:11,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

1367
01:41:45,542 --> 01:41:47,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spin it around

1368
01:41:47,782 --> 01:41:48,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There it is.

1369
01:41:48,842 --> 01:41:51,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Late model black sedan at 10 o'clock.

1370
01:42:00,032 --> 01:42:01,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you, John?

1371
01:42:02,202 --> 01:42:03,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you really?

1372
01:42:04,202 --> 01:42:05,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean?

1373
01:42:05,702 --> 01:42:09,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At this stage, what harm can it do to tell us about yourself?

1374
01:42:09,672 --> 01:42:13,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't matter who I am. Who I am means absolutely nothing.

1375
01:42:13,382 --> 01:42:15,212
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to stay on your left up here.

1376
01:42:19,212 --> 01:42:20,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So where are we heading?

1377
01:42:21,652 --> 01:42:22,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll see.

1378
01:42:23,482 --> 01:42:26,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not just going to pick up 2 more bodies, are we? John.

1379
01:42:27,392 --> 01:42:29,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That wouldn't be shocking enough.

1380
01:42:29,722 --> 01:42:32,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got newspapers to think about, yeah?

1381
01:42:33,792 --> 01:42:36,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wanting people to listen,

1382
01:42:36,232 --> 01:42:40,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore.

1383
01:42:40,062 --> 01:42:42,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to hit them with a sledge hammer.

1384
01:42:42,632 --> 01:42:45,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you'll get their strict attention.

1385
01:42:45,572 --> 01:42:47,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the quesition is

1386
01:42:47,702 --> 01:42:50,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}why're you so special that people should listen?

1387
01:42:50,572 --> 01:42:52,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not special.

1388
01:42:53,082 --> 01:42:55,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never been exceptional.

1389
01:42:55,812 --> 01:42:58,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is, though. What I'm doing.

1390
01:42:58,652 --> 01:42:59,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My work.

1391
01:42:59,882 --> 01:43:01,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your work, John?

1392
01:43:01,622 --> 01:43:02,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

1393
01:43:03,322 --> 01:43:06,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, I don't see anything special about it, John.

1394
01:43:07,492 --> 01:43:08,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not true.

1395
01:43:08,962 --> 01:43:12,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it is true. And the funny thing is, all this work

1396
01:43:13,162 --> 01:43:15,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in 2 months from now on, no one's gonna care,

1397
01:43:15,062 --> 01:43:17,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}no one's gonna give a shit, no one's gonna remember.

1398
01:43:18,262 --> 01:43:20,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't see the whole complete act yet.

1399
01:43:21,772 --> 01:43:23,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when this is done,

1400
01:43:24,772 --> 01:43:26,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when it's finished,

1401
01:43:27,842 --> 01:43:29,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's going to be...

1402
01:43:32,442 --> 01:43:35,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}people will barely be able to comprehend,

1403
01:43:35,842 --> 01:43:38,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but they won't be able to deny.

1404
01:43:39,512 --> 01:43:41,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could the freak be more vague?

1405
01:43:42,182 --> 01:43:44,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As far as master plans go... John...

1406
01:43:44,622 --> 01:43:46,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really can't wait for you to see.

1407
01:43:46,852 --> 01:43:48,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's really going to be something.

1408
01:43:49,622 --> 01:43:52,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Know what? I'm gonna be standing right next to you.

1409
01:43:52,532 --> 01:43:55,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So when this big thing happens, be sure and let me know.

1410
01:43:55,862 --> 01:43:57,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couse I wouldn't want to miss it.

1411
01:43:57,402 --> 01:43:59,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, don't worry.

1412
01:43:59,462 --> 01:44:00,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You won't.

1413
01:44:02,632 --> 01:44:04,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You won't miss a thing.

1414
01:44:11,942 --> 01:44:13,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Going south, keep two miles separation.

1415
01:44:13,822 --> 01:44:14,822
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Affirmative!

1416
01:44:31,322 --> 01:44:32,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's so exciting?

1417
01:44:33,892 --> 01:44:36,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not too far now.

1418
01:44:43,232 --> 01:44:46,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been trying to figure something in my head.

1419
01:44:46,342 --> 01:44:47,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you can help me out.

1420
01:44:49,542 --> 01:44:53,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When a person is insane, as you clearly are,

1421
01:44:53,172 --> 01:44:55,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}do you know that you're insane?

1422
01:44:56,182 --> 01:44:58,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you're sitting around reading Guns and Ammo,

1423
01:44:58,582 --> 01:45:00,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}masturbating in your own feces...

1424
01:45:00,282 --> 01:45:02,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just stop and go

1425
01:45:02,422 --> 01:45:06,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Wow, it's amazing. How fucking crazy I really am"?

1426
01:45:06,092 --> 01:45:08,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? Do you guys do that?

1427
01:45:09,192 --> 01:45:12,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's more comfortable for you to label me insane.

1428
01:45:12,262 --> 01:45:13,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's very comfortable.

1429
01:45:14,192 --> 01:45:17,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not something I would expect you to accept.

1430
01:45:17,862 --> 01:45:20,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I did not choose. I was chosen.

1431
01:45:21,032 --> 01:45:22,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever.

1432
01:45:22,272 --> 01:45:24,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't doubt that you believe that. John.

1433
01:45:25,272 --> 01:45:27,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it seems to me that you're

1434
01:45:27,372 --> 01:45:29,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}overlooking a glaring contradiction.

1435
01:45:29,542 --> 01:45:30,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meaning what?

1436
01:45:31,942 --> 01:45:33,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Glad you asked.

1437
01:45:35,212 --> 01:45:36,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you were chosen...

1438
01:45:37,052 --> 01:45:41,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that is, by a higher power.

1439
01:45:41,552 --> 01:45:43,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if your hand was forced,

1440
01:45:44,052 --> 01:45:45,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it seems strange to me that

1441
01:45:45,392 --> 01:45:47,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you'd get such enjoyment out of it.

1442
01:45:47,792 --> 01:45:50,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You enjoyed torturing those people.

1443
01:45:51,392 --> 01:45:54,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That doesn't seem in keeping with martyrdom, does it?

1444
01:45:56,062 --> 01:45:57,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John?

1445
01:46:02,132 --> 01:46:03,792
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I doubt I enjoyed it any more

1446
01:46:03,792 --> 01:46:06,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}than Det. Mills would enjoy time alone with me

1447
01:46:06,932 --> 01:46:08,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in a room without windows.

1448
01:46:09,542 --> 01:46:10,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't that true?

1449
01:46:11,472 --> 01:46:14,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How happy would it make you to hurt me with impunity?

1450
01:46:15,032 --> 01:46:17,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That will hurt my feelings. I would never.

1451
01:46:17,912 --> 01:46:20,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wouldn't only because there's consequences.

1452
01:46:21,822 --> 01:46:24,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's in those eyes of yours, though.

1453
01:46:24,922 --> 01:46:27,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.

1454
01:46:28,152 --> 01:46:31,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't deny my own personal desire

1455
01:46:31,092 --> 01:46:33,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to turn each sin against the sinner.

1456
01:46:33,832 --> 01:46:35,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute,

1457
01:46:35,382 --> 01:46:37,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought all you did was killing innocent people.

1458
01:46:39,502 --> 01:46:42,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny?

1459
01:46:42,932 --> 01:46:44,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An obese man,

1460
01:46:44,672 --> 01:46:47,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}disgusting man who could barely stand up,

1461
01:46:47,272 --> 01:46:48,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a man if you saw him at street

1462
01:46:48,562 --> 01:46:50,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you'd point him out to your friends

1463
01:46:50,072 --> 01:46:51,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so that they'd join you in mocking him.

1464
01:46:51,842 --> 01:46:56,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you saw him while you ate, you couldn't finish your meal.

1465
01:46:57,012 --> 01:46:58,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After him, I picked the lawyer.

1466
01:46:58,802 --> 01:46:59,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you both must have secretly been

1467
01:46:59,872 --> 01:47:00,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}thanking me for that one.

1468
01:47:00,952 --> 01:47:05,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the man who dedicated his life to making money

1469
01:47:05,482 --> 01:47:08,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by lying with every breath that he could muster

1470
01:47:08,952 --> 01:47:12,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to keeping murderers and rapists on the streets.

1471
01:47:12,052 --> 01:47:15,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Murderers? Murderers, John, like yourself. - A womam.

1472
01:47:15,012 --> 01:47:18,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bear to

1473
01:47:18,182 --> 01:47:21,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside?

1474
01:47:21,202 --> 01:47:24,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A drug dealer. A drug dealing pederast, actually.

1475
01:47:24,362 --> 01:47:28,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And let's not forget the disease-spreading whore.

1476
01:47:30,672 --> 01:47:33,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only in a world this shitty...

1477
01:47:33,212 --> 01:47:35,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}could you even try to say these were innocent people

1478
01:47:35,472 --> 01:47:37,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and keep a straight face.

1479
01:47:40,052 --> 01:47:41,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's the point.

1480
01:47:43,152 --> 01:47:46,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We see a deadly sin on every street corner,

1481
01:47:46,392 --> 01:47:49,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in every home and we tolerate it.

1482
01:47:49,892 --> 01:47:52,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We tolerate it because it's common.

1483
01:47:52,732 --> 01:47:54,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's... it's trivial.

1484
01:47:54,732 --> 01:47:57,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We tolerate it morning, noon and night.

1485
01:48:00,732 --> 01:48:02,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, not anymore.

1486
01:48:04,902 --> 01:48:06,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm setting the example.

1487
01:48:08,342 --> 01:48:10,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what I've done is gonna be

1488
01:48:10,172 --> 01:48:11,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}puzzled over,

1489
01:48:12,012 --> 01:48:13,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and studied,

1490
01:48:14,682 --> 01:48:16,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and followed

1491
01:48:17,912 --> 01:48:19,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}forever.

1492
01:48:19,852 --> 01:48:21,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1493
01:48:22,352 --> 01:48:23,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Delusions of grandeur.

1494
01:48:25,692 --> 01:48:27,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should be thanking me.

1495
01:48:27,922 --> 01:48:29,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why's that, John?

1496
01:48:29,362 --> 01:48:32,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because you'll be remembered after this.

1497
01:48:32,592 --> 01:48:36,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Realize, Detective, the only reason that I'm here right now

1498
01:48:36,602 --> 01:48:38,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is that I wanted to be.

1499
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:41,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. We would have got you eventually.

1500
01:48:41,532 --> 01:48:42,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, really?

1501
01:48:43,032 --> 01:48:47,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what were you doing, biding your time? Toying with me?

1502
01:48:47,772 --> 01:48:51,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Allowing 5 "innocent" people to die until

1503
01:48:51,942 --> 01:48:53,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you felt like springing your trap?

1504
01:48:53,442 --> 01:48:55,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me. What was the indisputable

1505
01:48:55,442 --> 01:48:58,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}evidence you were going to use on me, right before

1506
01:48:58,552 --> 01:49:02,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I walked up to you and put my hands in the air?

1507
01:49:02,282 --> 01:49:04,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John. Calm down.

1508
01:49:04,552 --> 01:49:07,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I seem to remember us knocking on your door.

1509
01:49:07,962 --> 01:49:09,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right.

1510
01:49:09,392 --> 01:49:12,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I seem to remember breaking your face.

1511
01:49:17,232 --> 01:49:19,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're only alive because I didn't kill you.

1512
01:49:19,872 --> 01:49:21,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Sit back.

1513
01:49:21,632 --> 01:49:23,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I spared you. - Sit back.

1514
01:49:23,732 --> 01:49:26,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember that Detective, every time you look in the mirror

1515
01:49:26,302 --> 01:49:29,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}at that face of yours for the rest of your life...

1516
01:49:29,012 --> 01:49:33,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or should I say for the rest of what life I allow you to have.

1517
01:49:33,582 --> 01:49:35,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sit back, you fucking freak!

1518
01:49:35,582 --> 01:49:37,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut your fucking mouth!

1519
01:49:38,652 --> 01:49:39,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're no messiah.

1520
01:49:39,962 --> 01:49:44,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a movie of the week. You're a fucking T-shirt at best.

1521
01:49:58,262 --> 01:50:00,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't ask me to pity those people.

1522
01:50:00,672 --> 01:50:02,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't mourn them any more than the

1523
01:50:02,222 --> 01:50:05,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}1000's that died at Sodom and Gomorrah.

1524
01:50:05,102 --> 01:50:07,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that to say, John, that what you were doing

1525
01:50:07,812 --> 01:50:09,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was God's good work?

1526
01:50:12,942 --> 01:50:15,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The lord works in mysterious ways.

1527
01:50:17,952 --> 01:50:20,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you see those high-tension towers?

1528
01:50:20,452 --> 01:50:22,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's where we're headed.

1529
01:50:22,352 --> 01:50:23,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see where he's talking about.

1530
01:50:23,652 --> 01:50:24,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}9 o'clock, follow the access road.

1531
01:50:32,492 --> 01:50:35,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Your signal's breaking up. - Un-fucking-avoidable, sir.

1532
01:50:35,252 --> 01:50:37,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're in Powerline City. Deal with it.

1533
01:50:39,132 --> 01:50:41,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There sure as shit is no ambush out here.

1534
01:50:42,032 --> 01:50:43,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No fucking nothing out here.

1535
01:50:43,892 --> 01:50:45,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't land anywhere near those wires.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you got?

1546
01:52:16,882 --> 01:52:18,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A dead dog.

1547
01:52:19,882 --> 01:52:21,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't do that.

1548
01:52:28,292 --> 01:52:29,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What time is it?

1549
01:52:30,292 --> 01:52:31,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

1550
01:52:31,562 --> 01:52:32,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to know.

1551

1555
01:52:51,972 --> 01:52:53,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bird Two, close your distance.

1556
01:52:53,622 --> 01:52:57,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're moving away from the car.

1557

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got them, we got them.

1558
01:53:02,902 --> 01:53:04,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Closing in.

1559

01:53:55,672 --> 01:53:57,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not take the cross hairs off the guy in red.

1567
01:54:05,042 --> 01:54:06,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a van coming down the road.

1568
01:54:06,972 --> 01:54:08,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From the north.

1569
01:54:17,452 --> 01:54:21,422

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn around. Put your hands on your head.

1575
01:54:38,832 --> 01:54:40,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell is going on?

1576
01:54:41,002 --> 01:54:42,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why and what are you doing here?

1577
01:54:42,232 --> 01:54:44,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm delivering a package man,

1578
01:54:44,312 --> 01:54:46,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a package for this guy, David.

1579
01:54:46,242 --> 01:54:47,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Detective...

1582
01:54:59,702 --> 01:55:02,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's opening the back of van.

1583

1595
01:55:43,252 --> 01:55:45,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sending the driver out on foot.

1596
01:55:48,992 --> 01:55:50,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's headed north, along the road.

1599
01:56:09,612 --> 01:56:11,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to open it.

1600
01:56:11,182 --> 01:56:14,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I said I admire you, I meant what I said.

1601
01:56:33,832 --> 01:56:34,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's blood.

1602
01:56:34,962 --> 01:56:37,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've made quite a life for yourself, Detective.

1603
01:56:37,632 --> 01:56:39,252

1608

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tracy.

1619
01:57:38,652 --> 01:57:41,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What you fucking say? - It's disturbing

1620
01:57:41,322 --> 01:57:44,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how easily a member of the press can purchase

01:57:53,332 --> 01:57:55,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}after you left.

1626
01:57:55,832 --> 01:57:57,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried to play husband.

1627
01:57:58,172 --> 01:58:01,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried to taste the life of a simple man.

1628

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Throw it away!

1629
01:58:03,172 --> 01:58:05,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It didn't work out.

1630
