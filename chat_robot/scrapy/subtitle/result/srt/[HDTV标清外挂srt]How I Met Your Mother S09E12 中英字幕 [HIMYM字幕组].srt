仔细看看这张脸 巴尼 好吗
Take a good look at this face, Barney, okay?

27
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:56,233

00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,174
我要是真穿成李伯拉斯那样儿呢
What if I dressed up as Liberace?

137
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:09,158
-成交  -成交
-Sold! -Sold.

138
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:12,545
然后 就没有然后了
And that was the end of it.

139
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:14,163
直到我的单身派对
Until my bachelor party.

140
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:15,348
啧啧
Uh-oh.

141
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,566
我猜猜看
Let me guess:

142
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:17,934
派对上肯定有个脱衣舞娘
there was a stripper.

143
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:20,169
你玩儿得挺美
You had a little fun.

144
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:22,806
备不住还禁不住怂恿 拍了几张少儿不宜的照片
Maybe took some ill-advised pictures.

145
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:23,890
然后紧接着
Next thing you know,

146
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:25,942
她就开始以此要挟勒索你 直到你几近破产
she's blackmailing you into bankruptcy,

147
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:27,360
你的医学学位就得挂在
and your medical degree's hanging on the wall

148
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:29,813
某真人激光枪游戏厅保安部的墙上
of a laser tag security office!

149
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:32,949
没有啊
No.

150
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:34,818
我单身派对那晚 我的哥们儿们把我带到了
The night of my bachelor party, my friends took me

151
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,152
一个屎到爆的破旅馆
to a crappy hotel,

152
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:37,988
把我前未婚妻请来当脱衣舞娘
hired my ex-fiancée to be the stripper,

153
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,856
我输了好几千块钱 而我最好的朋友
I lost thousands of dollars, and my best friend

154
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:40,857
连手都被人砍了
even had his hand cut off.

155
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:41,858
这本会是我人生中
It would've been

156
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,076
最糟糕的一个晚上
the worst night of all time

157
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:44,360
但这一切 都只是我
if the whole thing hadn't been

158
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:45,462
既有美丽又有魅力的未婚妻
a prank planned by

159
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:47,414
一手策划的充满惊喜的恶作剧
my beautiful, amazing fiancee.

160
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,833
她让我跌落地狱 就是为了让我
She put me through hell just to give me the best

161
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:52,218
拥有人生中最棒的惊喜 这里面还包括了
surprise of my life...which, p.S.,included an appearance

162
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,420
我最喜欢的演员的出场
by my favorite actor--

163
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:55,505
不属于A片范畴的
non-porn category.

164
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:57,707
哇 听起来挺酷的
Wow, that sounds pretty cool.

165
00:04:57,709 --> 00:04:59,576
可不是嘛 唯一不酷的就是
Yeah. Except pretty not cool,

166
00:04:59,578 --> 00:05:01,761
这个人嘴上一直说什么会再回敬我一个
because he kept talking about how he was gonna get me back,

167
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:04,097
然后 就在派对几天后 还真就...
and sure enough, a few days later...

168
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:06,733
罗宾 有些话我真的不知道该怎么跟你说
Robin, there's no good way to say this.

169
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:09,019
我犯了一个天大的错误
I've made a huge mistake.

170
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:10,820
这婚我没法结了
I can't go through with the wedding.

171
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:12,489
你说什么
What?

172
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:13,690
真的非常对不起
I'm so sorry.

173
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:15,492
只是 我...我必须在
I-I just... I had to tell you

174
00:05:15,494 --> 00:05:17,193
一切再也无可挽回之前告诉你
before it was too late.

175
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:19,496
天啊 你是认真的吗
Oh, my God, you're serious.

176
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:20,396
是
Yeah.

177
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:23,232
而且这里是我的公寓
And since this is my apartment,

178
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:25,168
所以 我觉得你应该搬出去了
I think that you should move out.

179
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:29,756
行啊
Fine.

180
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:34,410
狗狗
Puppies!

181
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,465
我知道 超棒的恶作剧 是不
I know. Great prank, right?

182
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:40,083
简直糟糕透顶
That is awful.

183
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:41,751
你丫绝壁是个怪胎
You're a frickin' weirdo.

184
00:05:41,753 --> 00:05:44,771
妥妥儿的怪胎
Such a weirdo.

185
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:46,139
小心点 别弄脏了袍子
Careful, watch the robe.

186
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:47,774
但是吧
Anyway,

187
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:49,776
因为某些只有你们和罗宾能理解
for reasons only you guys and Robin

188
00:05:49,778 --> 00:05:51,861
而像我这样的正常人所不能理解的原因
but nobody normal like me would understand,

189
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:53,262
罗宾变得超暴躁
she got cranky.

190
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:55,148
然后立下规矩
And she laid down the law.

191
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,566
不许再搞惊喜
No more surprises.

192
00:05:56,568 --> 00:05:58,318
但是你明明爱死惊喜了嘛
But you love surprises.

193
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,237
你爱惊喜就跟我爱舔自己一样
Almost as much as I love lickin' myself!

194
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:03,106
这话是我说的 不是狗狗说的
That was me talking, not the puppy.

195
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:04,457
巴尼 惊喜这东西很难收场的
Barney, the surprises are out of hand

196
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:05,408
不能再搞惊喜了
and they have to stop.

197
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,960
-行吗  -但是...
-Deal? -But...

198
00:06:06,962 --> 00:06:07,911
-行吗  -但是...
-Deal? -But...

199
00:06:07,913 --> 00:06:10,046
-行吗  -屁屁...
-Deal. -Butt...

200
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:10,780
巴尼
Barney...

201
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:13,133
好啦
Fine.

202
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:14,617
{\a6}deal还同时有小弟弟的意思

203
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:14,617
哦了
Deal.

204
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:16,469
老天
Man.

205
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:18,421
这个"不许再搞惊喜"的规矩
This whole "No more surprises" thing

206
00:06:18,423 --> 00:06:20,123
太不公平了
is so unfair.

207
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,141
谁会这么干啊
Who does that?

208
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:23,476
巴尼 "不再有惊喜"
Barney, the "No more surprises" thing

209
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:25,261
是婚姻中最好的部分
is the best part of being married.

210
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:26,796
真的 每天早晨我醒来的时候
It's true. When I wake up in the morning,

211
00:06:26,798 --> 00:06:29,298
我连莉莉的呼吸是什么味道的都能一清二楚
I know what Lily's breath is gonna smell like.

212
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,984
她的呼吸 就像玫瑰一样香甜
It's like... roses.

213
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:33,019
难道你真的希望在你和罗宾婚后的生活里
Do you really want a marriage

214
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:34,187
你每天都需要琢磨
where you have this paranoia

215
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:36,156
罗宾有没有偷偷摸摸的
that Robin's hiding around every corner,

216
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:38,608
搞些什么新恶作剧来回敬你吗
planning to get you back with some crazy new prank?

217
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,527
你说的一点错都没有
You're absolutely right.

218
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:41,528
谢谢你 莉莉
Thank you, Lily.

219
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,613
不对 那...是我说的 我在这儿呢
No, th... that was me, over here.

220
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:44,497
他根本没在听
He wasn't listening.

221
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:45,782
如果你们想告诉我的...
If you guys are saying

222
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:46,916
就是你们刚才说的
what I think you're saying...

223
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:48,118
非常有可能不是 你继续说
Probably not. Go on.

224
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,152
...那你们一定就是说...
...then that must mean...

225
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:50,153
不是 我们没那个意思
No, it doesn't.

226
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:52,455
...罗宾在为我策划一个
...that Robin is planning a surprise

227
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:54,841
真人激光枪惊喜预演晚宴
laser tag rehearsal dinner!

228
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,385
伙计 罗宾根本没有在策划
Dude, Robin is not planning

229
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,386
什么真人激光枪惊喜预演晚宴好嘛
a surprise laser tag rehearsal dinner.

230
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,337
不对 她有
Yes, she is.

231
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,138
-不 她没有  -不 她肯定有
-No, she isn't.  -Yes, she is.

232
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,773
不 我才没有
No, I'm not!

233
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:07,975
不 她有的
Yes, she is.

234
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:09,743
不 她没有
No, she isn't.

235
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:11,411
那她又是为什么
Then why did she pretend

236
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:13,513
装作在嘲笑这主意有多傻呢
to ridicule it as an idiotic idea?

237
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:16,683
因为这主意本来就傻透了
Because it is an idiotic idea.

238
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:18,485
如果罗宾真的
If Robin actually was

239
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:19,987
在策划什么惊喜
planning a surprise,

240
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:22,055
她至少会告诉她的首席伴娘吧
don't you think she would tell her maid of honor?

241
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:23,941
她没告诉你你因为你根本守不住秘密
She didn't tell you 'cause you can keep a secret

242
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,826
就像我的牙医总丢车钥匙
the way my dentist keeps his car keys.

243
00:07:27,262 --> 00:07:30,563
你们不认识他啊 不过他确实总弄丢
You don't know him, but he's lost them...

244
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:31,665
两次呢
like, twice.

245
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:32,899
其实是 只有一次是丢的
Actually, just once, and...

246
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:35,002
另一次是放另一个口袋里了
that time they were in his other pocket.

247
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:37,204
我守不住秘密吗
I can't keep a secret?

248
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,538
他说的有道理 莉莉
He does have a point, Lily.

249
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,240
你在大嘴跑风方面已经非常有名了
You're kind of famous for the old blabbity-blabbity.

250
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:41,375
嘿
Hey.

251
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,593
和黛比的午餐如何
How was lunch with Debbie?

252
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,211
好极 她怀孕了
Great. She's pregnant!

253
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,262
呜
Oops.

254
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,097
我不该告诉别人的
I'm not supposed to tell anybody. Why not?

255
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,765
因为她正在打离婚
Because she's getting a divorce.

256
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:49,916
妈蛋
Damn it!

257
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:51,084
黛比正闹离婚
Debbie's getting a divorce?

258
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:53,804
嗯 她把她老公捉奸在床了
Yeah, she walked in on her husband having sex.

259
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,022
搞毛啊 莉莉
Oh! Come on, Lily.

260
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:56,773
呃 也不用什么细节都说出来吧
Well, maybe we don't need to know every gory...

261
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:57,891
还是和一个男的
With a man.

262
00:07:57,893 --> 00:08:00,727
你就不能闭嘴嘛 艾尔德林女士
Will you get it together, Aldrin?!

263
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:01,895
你没事吧 莉莉
You okay, Lily?

264
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:04,597
而那个男人正是搞大黛比肚子的
And that guy's the father of the baby.

265
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:04,597
{\a6}贵圈 真乱

266
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:06,867
我回去躺一会
I gotta go lie down.

267
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:09,987
于是就到今天早些时候
Which brings us to earlier today,

268
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,956
罗宾在布置假的预演晚宴时
when Robin was setting up the decoy rehearsal dinner,

269
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,875
连酒都是假的
complete with fake booze.

270
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:16,275
{\a6}预演晚宴前一小时

271
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:18,378
把这个当威士忌蒙混过去啊
Trying to pass this off as Scotch,

272
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,631
我们都知道这其实是苹果汁
and we all know it's apple juice.

273
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:29,122
喝苹果汁呛嗓子了
Typical apple juice burn.

274
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:32,259
没错 巴尼 这酒是真的
Yes, Barney, the booze is real.

275
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,560
吃的也是真的
The food is real.

276
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:35,896
哦 说到吃的 无花果培根卷在哪儿呢
Ooh, speaking of which, where are the bacon-wrapped figs?

277
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:37,681
大概在
Probably at...

278
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,965
真人激光枪游戏厅了吧
...the laser tag place,

279
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,268
那儿不才是真正的预演晚宴举办的地方么
where the real rehearsal dinner's going down.

280
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,438
是不是这样 西奥多
Isn't that right, Theodore?

281
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,857
巴尼 没有什么真人激光枪
Barney, there is no laser tag.

282
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,108
咱们就在这儿好好吃顿饭
We're gonna have a nice dinner,

283
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,526
喝点酒 然后
some drinks, and then,

284
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:50,527
按照罗宾说的
according to Robin,

285
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,079
如果她的伊迪斯姑妈喝得够醉
if her Aunt Edith gets drunk enough,

286
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:53,813
她就会把假发摘下来 然后他们就能拿它打冰球了
she'll take off her wig and they'll play hockey with it.

287
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:54,915
胡说八道
Poppycock!

288
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:57,000
你知道她会怎么做的
You know how she's gonna do it,

289
00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:58,085
你也会如实告诉我的
and you're gonna tell me!

290
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:01,288
还是我要把脸凑得更近点
Or do I have to get my face

291
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,657
你才会告诉我
even closer to yours?

292
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:05,658
嘿
Hey.

293
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,927
你为什么不把脸
How come you're not getting

294
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:08,495
跟我的脸贴近点呢
uncomfortably close to my face?

295
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:10,997
我也有可能知道内情啊
I could be in on it, too.

296
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:13,833
可不嘛 莉莉
'Course you could, Lil.

297
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,469
我能保守秘密的
I can keep a secret.

298
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,887
莉莉哟 快别逗我了
Lily, don't make me laugh.

299
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,271
我要是信你能保守秘密
I'd trust you with a secret

300
00:09:18,273 --> 00:09:20,190
就跟我信马修会抖出秘密一样傻
as much as I'd trust Marshall with Pop Secret.

301
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,342
我能保守秘密的
I can keep a secret!

302
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,394
为了保守秘密我能守口如瓶
I can keep a secret real good.

303
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:26,730
我保守秘密的时候 就跟这秘密不关任何人的事儿一样
I can keep a secret like nobody's business,

304
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,682
因为它本身就不关任何人的事儿
'cause it is nobody's business.

305
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:30,951
因为它是个秘密
'Cause it's a secret,

306
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:32,685
而且我没有把它说出来
and I'm keeping it!

307
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:33,653
马修刮后背吗
Does Marshall shave his back?

308
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:35,688
他才不刮呢 都是我替他刮 尼玛
No, I shave it for him. Damn it!

309
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,689
对了
Ooh!

310
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:38,041
我该给马修打个电话
I should call Marshall.

311
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:39,576
我敢肯定他也知道晚宴的事儿
I bet he's in on this.

312
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,694
如果他真的存在的话
If he really exists.

313
00:09:42,863 --> 00:09:44,364
好吧
Okay.

314
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:46,332
我就不说我帮你隐瞒了
Setting aside the fact that I've kept your 

315
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:49,136
搬去芝加哥的事这个事实
whole "Moving to Chicago" Thing a secret,

316
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:52,038
你现在不是应该穿成李伯拉斯的样子吗
aren't you supposed to be dressed like Liberace right now?

317
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,590
好吧 首先呢
Okay, first of all,

318
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:55,225
如果我现在就穿着服装出现
if I showed up in costume,

319
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,395
会破坏我之后华丽登场时的惊喜和壮观场面
it would steal from the surprise and spectacle of my grand entrance.

320
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,180
其次呢 我不打算这么玩了
And second of all, I'm not doing that.

321
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,348
为什么啊
Why not?

322
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,717
因为打扮成列勃拉斯很容易 但...
Because dressing like Liberace is easy, but...

323
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:08,388
啊 对 四四拍 E大调...
Uh, yes, 4/4, E-sharp...

324
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,724
大三度...
major...

325
00:10:11,726 --> 00:10:13,443
好
Okay.

326
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:16,947
咱们来制造点美妙的音乐吧 如何
Let's make something beautiful, shall we?

327
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:21,401
我觉得今天练得差不多了
I think that's enough for today.

328
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:25,505
好了 我已经分析出事情会怎样进行了
Okay, I figured out how this is gonna go down.

329
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:27,924
我们会"急缺"冰块
We're gonna "Run out" Of ice,

330
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:29,909
然后罗宾会让我去买
and Robin's gonna ask me to go get some,

331
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:32,512
于是 你们瞧 整个小镇唯一一个
and lo and behold, the only place that sells ice

332
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:36,550
卖冰的地方就在一家真人激光枪游戏厅旁边
in this whole town is right next to the local laser taggery.

333
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,218
我走进去 然后...
I go inside and...

334
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,352
惊喜来啦
Surprise!

335
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:41,721
美好的晚宴 家人和朋友
Beautiful dinner, family and friends,

336
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:44,224
免费的游戏代币还有经典街机游戏
free game tokens and an off-road arcade game

337
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,226
已经装备了无限制涡轮驱动
that's rigged for unlimited turbos!

338
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,145
这是唯一蠢到家的...
That is the single stupidest...

339
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,563
同志们 真不敢相信
Guys, you aren't gonna believe this.

340
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,782
制冰机坏掉了
The ice machine is broken.

341
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,733
坏了是吧
Is it now?

342
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:57,537
真见鬼呢 这种事儿能有多大概率
Well, dog my cats, what are the chances?

343
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:00,040
好吧 现在怎么办呢
Huh? What do we do?

344
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,742
呃 我可以出去弄点冰回来
Well, I guess I could go get some ice.

345
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:03,877
哦 不用了 他们会派人去的
Uh, no, they'll send someone.

346
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,579
行 好吧 非让我去不可 我这就去
All right, fine. Twist my arm. I'll do it.

347
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,713
不过说真的 哈
But seriously, Hmm?

348
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:08,498
你们把那边都布置好了吗
did you get everything set up over there?

349
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,167
食物充足不 枪支齐备不
Do you have enough food, have enough guns?

350
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,752
有没有给斯丁森奶奶准备超大号背心 她可是...
Did you get a vest extender for Grandma Stinson? She's...

351
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:15,222
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

352
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:19,309
哦 宝贝 你好擅长掩饰哦 我好爱你哦
Oh, babe, you're so good at this. I love it.

353
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,261
好了 咱们在那边见吧
All right, I'll see you guys over there.

354
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,762
我是说 我马上回来
I mean, be right back.

355
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:26,566
巴尼 巴尼 这就是咱们的预演晚宴
Barney, Barney, this is our rehearsal dinner, okay?

356
00:11:26,568 --> 00:11:28,268
不要离开这栋楼
Do not leave the premises.

357
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,070
跟我保证你哪儿也不去
Promise me you're not going anywhere.

358
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:31,154
好
Fine.

359
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:31,988
说出来
Say it.

360
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,491
说你保证你不会走
Say you promise you won't leave.

361
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,861
我保证我不会走
I promise I won't leave.

362
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,996
于是我走了 多么巧啊
So I left. And what do you know,

363
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:44,084
冰店的旁边就是一家真人激光枪游戏厅
the ice store is right next to a laser tag place!

364
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:46,486
根本不是 两家店相距六英里
No, it isn't! It's six miles away

365
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:47,671
而且在相反的方向
in the opposite direction.

366
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,506
而且我明明说了让你不要走
And I told you not to go!

367
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,707
是啊 不过你也说过
Yeah, well, you also told me

368
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,659
婚礼上不想要花熊
didn't want a ring bear at the wedding.

369
00:11:52,661 --> 00:11:53,627
是花童
Ring bear-er!

370
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,828
我们都知道那会有多赞 重点是
We all know how great that's gonna be. The point is,

371
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,214
我顺着她的计划演
I played along with her plan,

372
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,833
还表现得很"自然" 这样就不会剧透惊喜
and I acted "Natural" So I wouldn't spoil the surprise.

373
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:03,587
我的七舅老爷啊
Oh, my goodness!

374
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,388
真人激光枪
Laser tag?!

375
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,507
或许我应该进去待一会儿呢
Maybe I should go in here for a minute,

376
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:09,226
只是去看看 没什么特别的理由
just check it out for no apparent reason.

377
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,843
哟 这是什么
And what's this?

378
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:13,346
我的免手提代币小腰包
My hands-free token satchel?

379
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:15,949
还有我的终身免费续杯根啤马克杯
And my free lifetime refill root beer mug?

380
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:20,070
那过去的两个月里
So for the past two months

381
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,122
我们借给你公寓用来
when we were letting you use our apartment

382
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:24,023
每周日晚上练习钢琴的时候
to practice the piano every Sunday night,

383
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:25,408
你都在干嘛
what were you doing?

384
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,579
哦 他是个MVP这就不算走步了吗
Oh, so that's not traveling 'cause he's the MVP?

385
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,579
{\a6}MVP most valuable player 最有价值球员

386
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:32,365
搞什么
Come on!

387
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:35,001
巴尼去哪儿了 有人见到他了吗
Where's Barney? Has anyone seen him?

388
00:12:35,003 --> 00:12:36,369
罗宾 泰德完全放弃了
Robin, Ted's totally bailing

389
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,338
为你和巴尼演奏钢琴的事
on playing the piano for you and Barney.

390
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,975
哦 真的吗 泰德 你并不需要这样做的呢
Oh, really? Ted, you didn't have to not do that.

391
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:43,009
不过真是谢谢啦
But thank you.

392
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:45,729
但他保证过的 承诺就是承诺
But he promised! A promise is a promise.

393
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,514
你不能明明说好要做一件事
You can't say you're gonna do something

394
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,216
却突然去做完全不同的另一件事
and then suddenly do something completely different!

395
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:52,018
你为什么对这事这么生气
Why are you getting so worked up about this?

396
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,822
因为 很显然 我是在为另外一件
Because, obviously, I'm worked up for a different

397
00:12:55,824 --> 00:12:56,856
与之类似的事情生气
but somewhat similar reason.

398
00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:58,525
该有人来问问我了吧
And someone should ask me about it!

399
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,278
不好意思 我现在没有时间陪你闹 莉莉
I'm sorry. I don't have time for your drama right now, Lily.

400
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,445
我的未婚夫失踪了
My fiance is missing.

401
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:04,331
马修被选中当法官了
Marshall got picked to be a judge.

402
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,533
他连问都没问我 就接受了这份工作
He took the job without even asking me.

403
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:09,068
意大利没戏了
Italy's off!

404
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:14,588
我的时间就是来陪你闹的
I have time for your drama.

405
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:21,516
-这么说 马修不能去意大利了吗  -如果他想当法官的话
-So, Marshall can't go to Italy? -Not if he wants to be a judge.

406
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,907
但我的意大利语现在说的可好了
And my Italian was getting so good.

407
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,020
特别的...
It was so...

408
00:13:26,036 --> 00:13:29,120
\N我是一个工作到意大利的告别

409
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:30,620
\N好桑感

410
00:13:30,824 --> 00:13:32,792
等等 你们俩已经把公寓转租了
But wait, you guys already sublet the apartment.

411
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:34,661
你的行李都收拾好了
I mean, you're already packed.

412
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:37,380
马修已经借走而且弄丢了我的罗塞达石碑
Marshall already borrowed and lost my Rosetta Stone.

413
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:37,380
{\a6}刻有希腊文及埃及象形文字的石板 用于研究古埃及文字

414
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:39,082
这个自私的魂淡
That selfish bastard!

415
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,401
抱歉 莉儿 喂
Sorry, Lil. Hello.

416
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,136
好了 我也很愤怒
Okay, I'm mad, too.

417
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:44,638
你就该愤怒
I should hope so.

418
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,123
突然之间 他的梦想就比你的梦想更重要了吗
All of a sudden, his dream is more important than yours?

419
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,792
而且他还背着你做这事
And he did it behind your back.

420
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:49,993
魂淡
Bastardo!

421
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,761
他绝对不会故意伤害我的
He would never hurt me intentionally.

422
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:53,513
我会故意伤害他的
I'll hurt him intentionally.

423
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:54,814
极其魂淡
Molto bastardo!

424
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:56,066
你这样说真贴心
That's sweet of you to say.

425
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,218
你再过一百万年也打不过马修的
You could never take Marshall in a million years,

426
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,070
不过你这样说真贴心哈
but that's sweet of you to say.

427
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:04,074
好吧 很显然 巴尼去了真人激光枪游戏厅
Well, apparently, Barney went to the laser tag place

428
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,743
去找他那个惊喜预演晚宴
looking for a surprise rehearsal dinner.

429
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,062
结果他没找到 就威胁要
When he didn't find one, he threatened

430
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:10,730
把零食柜台售货员的脑袋
to dunk the snack bar guy's head

431
00:14:10,732 --> 00:14:14,367
塞进装满滚烫玉米片的大桶里
into a vat of scalding nacho Whiz.

432
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:16,036
他现在被扣住了 等着警察过去呢
He's being held until the police arrive

433
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:18,922
我得来点苹果汁
I need your apple juice.

434
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:24,010
然后就变成这样了
And here we are.

435
00:14:24,012 --> 00:14:27,931
现在 我觉得猜谜游戏已经进行得差不多了
Now, I believe this charade has gone on long enough.

436
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,584
咱们快去那个惊喜真人激光枪预演晚宴吧 好不好
Can we please get to the surprise laser tag rehearsal?

437
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:34,137
嘿 根本没有什么惊喜真人激光枪预演晚宴
Hey, there is no surprise laser tag rehearsal dinner!

438
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,091
好吧 但我能不能提一个相反的观点呢
Okay, but if I may offer an opposing view.

439
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:39,726
当然有啦
Of course there is!

440
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:41,928
这地方到处都是线索
This place is lousy with clues.

441
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,398
这个人真的是个保安吗
Is he even really a security guard?

442
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,034
他看起来无比像一个非巴基斯坦版的
Because he looks an awful lot like a non-Pakistani version

443
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:51,037
我办公室的三明治外卖送货员
of the guy who delivers sandwiches at my office.

444
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,706
而且...
Also...

445
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:59,612
"真人激光枪"和"预演晚宴"的字数一样多
"Laser tag" Has the same number of letters as "Rehearsal."

446
00:14:59,614 --> 00:15:02,832
"真人激光枪"有8个字母 "预演晚宴"⑨个
Laser tag has eight, rehearsal has nine.

447
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:07,387
而且如果你重新排列一下这些字母 再加上一些字母
And if you rearrange the letters and add some other ones,

448
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:11,641
就会变成 "准备好 巴尼 为你最大的惊喜
it says, "Get ready, Barney, for the biggest surprise ever,

449
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:13,994
你个帅气的小..."
you handsome son of a..."

450
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,462
后面没有足够的字母来拼"王八蛋"了
and then not quite enough letters for "Bitch,"

451
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:17,514
不过你已经尽力了 罗宾
but good try, Robin.

452
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,849
这也太疯狂了 巴尼
This is crazy, Barney.

453
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:22,018
我们的婚姻不应该是这样的
We-We can't have a marriage like this.

454
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,022
婚姻必须建立在诚实以及信任
A marriage has to be built on honesty and trust

455
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:28,408
还有各种莉莉马修的那堆什么玩意儿上
and all of that Lily-and-Marshall crap.

456
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,778
我以为我们的婚姻是建立在诚实以及信任
I though our marriage was built on honesty and trust

457
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,198
还有各种莉莉马修的那堆什么玩意儿上
and all that Lily- and-Marshal crap.

458
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,917
我觉得真的好孤单
I just feel so alone right now.

459
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,537
但是 你并不孤单 有我在呢
Well, you're not. I'm here.

460
00:15:41,655 --> 00:15:44,090
我知道你能守住秘密
And I know you can keep a secret.

461
00:15:44,092 --> 00:15:46,092
是啊
Yeah, right.

462
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:47,344
要不这样
Tell you what.

463
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,996
要不我告诉你另外一个秘密吧
How about I let you in on another secret?

464
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:51,965
更大的秘密
Something bigger.

465
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:53,967
比芝加哥还大吗
Bigger than Chicago?

466
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:58,471
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding?

467
00:15:58,473 --> 00:16:01,441
不 可否赏光
Nope. Want to do the honors?

468
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:06,846
女士们 先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

469
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:10,183
计划有些小变动
there's been a slight change of plan.

470
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:12,118
好啦 好啦
Fine! Fine.

471
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,570
你说得对 罗宾
You're right, Robin.

472
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,406
婚姻不是整天恶作剧
Marriage isn't about playing crazy pranks.

473
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,525
不是处心积虑编一堆谎话
It isn't about telling long expertly crafted lies

474
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:20,627
去掩盖这些恶作剧...
to cover those pranks...

475
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:22,412
你是怎么解开手铐的
How'd you get out of those handcuffs?

476
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,581
...再请个演员扮演保安
...and hiring actors to play security guards

477
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,167
还斥巨资弄出来这些个大的要死的
and spending exorbitant amounts of money on things

478
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:29,219
假的真人激光枪牌子什么的
like giant, fake laser tag signs.

479
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,054
都不要 这关乎诚信
No, it's about honesty.

480
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,173
六码的冰鞋是吧
Size six skate, right?

481
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:34,224
是啊
Yeah.

482
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,594
正因如此 我要对你完全诚实
And in that spirit, I got to be honest.

483
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,180
从今往后
Every now and then,

484
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:44,384
我若对你撒谎 就是撒谎了
I am gonna lie to you. I just am.

485
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:47,720
是为了给你准备惊喜的
If it's in the interest of an amazing surprise, that is.

486
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:51,991
你会被忽悠 哄骗
You're gonna get bamboozled, hoodwinked.

487
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:54,444
算了 直接说出来吧
Heck, I'll just say it.

488
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,163
{\a6}snow双关雪以及蒙混

489
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,163
你会被雪片般的谎言迷惑
You're gonna get snowed.

490
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,750
这里怎么下雪了
Why is it snowing in here?

491
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:01,918
穿好冰鞋
Put on the skates.

492
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,336
我们得走了
We gotta go.

493
00:17:03,338 --> 00:17:05,121
去哪儿
Where?

494
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:07,407
我们是要去哪儿啊
Where are we going?

495
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,626
去预演晚宴啊 小傻瓜
To the rehearsal dinner, silly.

496
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:13,046
接下来就是见证奇迹的时刻
Let's get this party started.

497
00:17:15,883 --> 00:17:18,017
什么
What?!

498
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:19,969
惊喜
Surprise!

499
00:17:20,754 --> 00:17:23,273
这 这是怎么回事
What-What is going on?

500
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,694
我知道你非常想在加拿大度过这个周末
I know how much you wanted to be in Canada this weekend.

501
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:29,612
所以 我给你把加拿大搬过来了
So I brought Canada to you.

502
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:33,099
还有 这是韦恩•格雷斯基的签名照
Oh, and here's an autographed picture of Wayne Gretzky.

503
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:34,434
谢谢
Thanks.

504
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:37,570
还有这家伙也不是什么真的保安
And this guy's not really a security guard.

505
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:45,628
* 从前有一个男孩 *
Once there was this boy who

506
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:51,784
* 穿过无数西装 把传奇挂在嘴边 *
Wore a lot of suits and said that stuff was "Legendary" 

507
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:55,839
* 他无数次击掌 *
He gave lots of high fives

508
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,975
* 无数次起誓 *
And swore...

509
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:04,063
* 婚姻与他无关 *
That he would never get married

510
00:18:05,232 --> 00:18:07,434
* 他以为他非常坚决 *
He really thought he meant it

511
00:18:07,436 --> 00:18:09,569
谢谢你让我参与其中
Thanks for letting me in on this.

512
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:11,521
就算到最后才有我的份
Even if it was at the very end.

513
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,655
不胜荣幸
My pleasure.

514
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:14,190
哦 顺便说一句
Oh, and by the way,

515
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:16,159
我还有一个秘密一直没说
there's one more secret I've been keeping.

516
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,694
那些个晚上我不是应该
All those nights I was supposed

517
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,078
在上钢琴课的吗
to be taking piano lessons?

518
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,833
我其实 是在上花样滑冰课
I was actually taking figure skating lessons!

519
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:28,288
* 从前有一个女孩 *
Once, there was this girl who...

520
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,759
孩子们 花样滑冰可不是只要两个月就能学会的 
Kids, it takes more than two months to learn how to figure skate.

521
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:36,129
我爱你
I love you.

522
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:38,181
我也爱你
I love you, too.

523
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,717
-我会再回敬你一个的 知道不  -来呀 
-I'm gonna get you back, you know? -Bring it.

524
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:48,174
* 无数次起誓 婚姻也与她无关 *
And swore she'd also never get married

525
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:51,778
* 她以为她非常坚决 *
She really thought she meant it.

526
00:18:56,578 --> 00:18:58,796
万万没想到这都是你做的
I can't believe you did all of this.

527
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:00,631
你不是讨厌加拿大的吗
Hey, I thought you didn't like Canada.

528
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:02,550
开什么玩笑 我爱死加拿大了好吗
Are you kidding? I love Canada.

529
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:06,787
{\a6}麝牛产于加拿大 多见于美洲原住民的图腾

530
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:06,787
麝了个牛的 这位是加拿大传奇医生 弗雷德里克•班廷吗
Holy musk ox, is that the legendary Canadian doctor Frederick Banting

531
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:07,922
哇哦
Whoa!

532
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:10,224
1924年 我发现了胰岛素
In 1924, I discovered insulin.

533
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:12,093
接招吧 糖尿病

534

看啊 曼尼托巴的子孙 诺曼•布雷基
Hey, look, it's Manitoba's native son, Norman Breakey.

who I think worked for the company that probably created Wonderbra.

546
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,415
滚蛋吧 老掉牙的拖带
au revoir vieille gaine façonné

加拿大助攻赢了两次世界大战
