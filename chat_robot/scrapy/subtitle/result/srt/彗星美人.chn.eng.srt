00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,250
贝蒂.戴维丝
安妮.柏丝特

2
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,020
乔治.桑托斯
西莉丝.特荷姆

3
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,280
慧星美人

4
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,150
[制片] 达利.桑尼克

5
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,580
编剧兼导演 约瑟夫.孟基维兹

6
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,570
或许你对莎拉.西顿杰出成就奖并不熟悉
The Sarah Siddons Award is perhaps unknown to you

7
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,570
它是用来颁给那些具知名度
It has been spared the sensational publicity

8
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,070
且最有价值的演员
of such questionable honors as the Pulitzer Prize

9
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,000
每年都由影艺协会来颁发
and those awards presented annually by that film society

10
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,080
这几位都是老牌演员
The distinguished-looking gentleman is an extremely old actor

11
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,590
由于身为演员 恐怕要讲上一阵子
Being an actor, he will go on speaking for some time

12
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,760
所讲的虽不十分重要
It is not important that you hear what he says

13
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,090
不过听听你是身在何处 或为何来此,是蛮重要的
However, it is important that you know where you are and why you are here

14
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,770
这里是莎拉奖的用餐大厅
This is the dining hall of the Sarah Siddons Society

15
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:49,350
正进行着杰出艺人表扬餐会
It is the annual banquet and presentation of the highest honor our theatre has:

16
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,110
莎拉杰出成就奖
the Sarah Siddons Award for Distinguished Achievement

17
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,030
在这些神圣的墙上
These hallowed walls, indeed many of these faces,

18
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,280
这些面孔都在注视着
have looked upon Modjeska, Ada Rehan and Minnie Fiske

19
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,620
这庄严的会场 屋里只有男人的声音
Mansfield's voice filled this room

20
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,540
跟死后成就才获肯定截然不同
It is unlikely that the windows have been opened since his death

21
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,460
如同你看到的那些较小奖项 都被颁发了
The minor awards, as you can see, have already been presented

22
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,050
例如编剧,导演奖
Minor awards are for such as the writer and director,

23
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,800
由于他们的成就有如建筑
since they merely construct a tower

24
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,800
架构出让世人喝采的美丽建筑
so that the world can applaud a light which flashes on top of it

25
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,310
可是再出风头也没有像 伊芙.哈林顿这般耀眼
And no brighter light has ever dazzled the eye than Eve Harrington

26
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,730
伊芙,但待会还有更多
Eve But more of Eve later

27
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,980
有关伊芙的事要告诉各位
All about Eve, in fact

28
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,020
有关伊芙及致谢词
To those who do not read,

29
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,820
对你们这些从未接触过戏剧 或上过剧院
attend the theatre, listen to unsponsored radio programs

30
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,660
或只听那无关紧要的电台节目 且对周遭世事不通的人
or know anything of the world in which you live,

31
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,160
或许我该自我介绍一下
it is perhaps necessary to introduce myself

32
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,410
我叫艾德生 杜维特
My name is Addison DeWitt

33
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,170
我的工作地点并非戏院 我也不出面讲话
My native habitat is the theatre In it, I toil not Neither do I spin

34
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,750
我是个影评人
I am a critic and commentator

35
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,510
也是戏剧的根本
I am essential to the theatre

36
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,680
这是凯伦.瑞奇
This is Karen Richards

37
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,260
是一位编剧的妻子 是经由婚姻才与戏剧结缘
She is the wife of a playwright, therefore of the theatre by marriage

38
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,480
以她背景本来是不该和 舞台扯上任何关系的
Nothing in her background should have brought her closer to the stage

39
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,480
然而在她念高中时
However, during her senior year at Radcliffe,

40
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,940
瑞奇先生的原著搬上银幕
Lloyd Richards lectured on the drama

41
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,110
来年凯伦便成为瑞奇太太
The following year Karen became Mrs Lloyd Richards

42
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,950
一般来说电影制片人分为两种
There are, in general, two types of theatrical producers

43
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,540
第一种制作人他有很多有钱朋友 愿意冒险来投资
One has a great many wealthy friends who will risk a tax-deductible loss

44
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,040
这种人是沉醉于艺术
This type is interested in art

45
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,540
而另一种制片人 每一部片子对他们而言
The other is one to whom each production means potential ruin or fortune

46
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,710
不是赔钱就是赚钱 这种人纯粹是想赚钱
This type is out to make a buck

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,130
麦斯.法宾先生
Meet Max Fabian

48
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,010
He is the producer of the play

49
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,310
他是制片人,为伊芙制作 一部夺得莎拉奖的戏剧
which has won for Eve Harrington the Sarah Siddons Award

50
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,810
玛歌.嘉琳是位戏剧明星
Margo Channing is a star of the theatre

51
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,230
在四岁时便登台演出
She made her first stage appearance at the age of four

52
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,690
“仲夏夜之梦”
in Midsummer Night's Dream

53
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:02,400
扮演一位仙女,完全令人意外 表现就如天生的明星
She played a fairy and entered, quite unexpectedly, stark naked

54
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,990
从那时起她便成为一位明星
She has been a star ever since

55
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,080
玛歌是一位伟大的明星
Margo is a great star A true star

56
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,160
一位真正的明星
She never was or will be anything less or anything else

57
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:20,500
她与众不同,十分杰出 并且空前绝后
Having covered in tedious detail not only the history of the Sarah Siddons Society,

58
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,420
赋予单调以色彩 不仅是莎拉影协的特色
but also the history of acting

59
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,090
也是表演界长久以来 固有的传统
since Thespis first stepped out of the chorus line,

60
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,510
贵宾终于开始谈到我们 为何来此的目的
our distinguished chairman has finally arrived at our reason for being here

61
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:36,940
我相当骄傲的,并光荣的将我的一生献给戏剧
I have been proud and privileged to have spent my life in the theatre,

62
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,030
一位穷苦的演员将自己的品味及风格 呈现在舞台上
a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage,

63
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,610
我很荣幸能在舞台上 渡过四十年
and I've been honored to be, for 40 years,

64
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,660
是“舞台”激励了 我们莎拉影协会
chief prompter of the Sarah Siddons Society

65
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,540
在我39次亲自颁发
39 times have I placed in deserving hands

66
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,290
我们演艺圈最高荣誉莎拉奖
this highest honor the theatre knows

67
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,300
当然没有一个演员比我更老
Surely no actor is older than I

68
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,010
而这位子让我十分荣幸
I've earned my place out of the sun

69
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:12,390
这座奖从来没有落在 比今晚得主更年轻的人
And never before has this award gone to anyone younger than its recipient tonight

70
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,690
从我手中传到她手上 是再恰当也不过了
How fitting that it should pass from my hands to hers

71
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,520
如此年轻的手,如此年轻的女孩
Such young hands Such a young lady

72
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,530
岁数虽小,但对戏剧的心 却远超过陈旧的剧场
Young in years, but whose heart is as old as the theatre

73
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,990
我们在座其中有幸认识她
Some of us are privileged to know her

74
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,410
你们都知道她的美貌及演技 响誉国际
We have seen beyond the beauty and artistry

75
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,750
我们都知道她的谦逊
that have made her name resound through the nation

76
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,750
她的敬业精神 以及对艺术的忠诚
We know her humility, her devotion,

77
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,920
她的爱,她那诚挚专一的爱
her loyalty to her art,

78
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,590
为我们工作岗位上
her love, her deep and abiding love for us,

79
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,430
以及我们所做的事:戏剧
for what we are and what we do, the theatre

80
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,260
她曾经只有个愿望
She has had one wish,

81
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,100
有个祈求,一个梦想
one prayer, one dream,

82
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,770
成为我们的一分子
to belong to us

83
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,440
今晚她的梦想成真了
Tonight her dream has come true,

84
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,360
因此,我们也该和她 怀有同样的梦想
and henceforth we shall dream the same of her

85
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,200
各位贵宾,先生和女士们:戏剧界的最高荣誉
Ladies and gentlemen, for distinguished achievement in the theatre,

86
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,290
莎拉奖颁给伊芙.哈林顿小姐
the Sarah Siddons Award to Miss Eve Harrington

87
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:38,840
太棒了
So greatful

88
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,580
伊芙,黄金女郎 封面女郎
(Addison) Eve Eve, the golden girl The cover girl

89
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,090
像邻家般的女孩 如月亮上的嫦娥
The girl next door, the girl on the moon Time has been good to Eve

90
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:09,340
造化待她不薄 好运总跟随着她,做过人物专访,封面人物
Life goes where she goes She's been profiled, covered, revealed, reported,

91
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,340
影界资讯报导她 吃什么,穿什么
what she eats and what she wears and whom she knows

92
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,600
认识些什么人,现身在何处 或何时要跟谁去什么地方
and where she was and when and where she's going

93
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,520
伊芙,
Eve

94
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,140
你们对伊芙的事 都很了解
You all know all about Eve

95
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,690
但你不知道什么呢?
What can there be to know that you don't know?

96
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,780
那是什么时候呢? 那是多久以前?
(Karen) When was it? How long?

97
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,530
似乎是一辈子前的事
It seems a lifetime ago

98
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,280
罗维常说演艺圈的生活
Lloyd always said that in the theatre a lifetime was a season

99
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,200
就好比是季节一般
and a season a lifetime

100
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,990
现在是六月了 那是十月上旬的事
It's June now That was early October

101
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,120
只不过是去年的十月
Only last October

102
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,960
那是个下毛毛雨的夜晚 我记得叫计程车等我
It was a drizzly night I remember I asked the taxi to wait

103
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,970
她那时人在哪呢?
Where was she?

104
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,720
奇怪地每晚都去探望她 突然变成我的习惯
Strange I'd become so accustomed to seeing her there night after night,

105
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,980
我发觉自己在找寻一位
I found myself looking for a girl I'd never spoken to

106
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,560
从未说过话的女孩
Wondering where she was

107
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,200
瑞奇女士
Mrs Richards?

108
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,660
你在这里呀!
There you are

109
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,000
现在已经很晚了 你不该在这里的
It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being here

110
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,500
那到底怎样才恰当呢?天呀!难道你应该吗?
-Why should you think I wouldn't be? -Why should you be?

111
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,330
毕竟一连好几礼拜六个晚上
Six nights a week for weeks

112
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,250
来看玛歌.嘉琳进出剧院
of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theatre

113
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,090
-希望你不介意我跟你说话 -没关系
-You don't mind my speaking to you? -Not at all

114
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,930
我经常看到你,我鼓足勇气
I've seen you so often It took every bit of courage I could raise

115
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,600
才敢和编剧的老婆说话?
To speak to just a playwright's wife?

116
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,100
那我和罗维也算名人吗?
I'm the lowest form of celebrity

117
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,520
你们是玛歌.嘉琳最好的朋友 你和你先生总是在她身边
You're Margo Channing's best friend You and your husband are always with her

118
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,440
以及还有辛普生先生,他是个什么样的人呢?
And Mr Sampson What's he like?

119
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,940
辛普生,他是个导演
Bill Sampson? He's a director

120
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,280
-他是一流的 -他跟你会有同感的
-He's the best -He'll agree with you

121
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,450
告诉我,在玛歌进出剧院时 你都在做什么?
Tell me What do you do in between the time Margo goes in and comes out?

122
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,040
就站在门口等吗?
Just huddle in that doorway and wait?

123
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,120
不!我进去看戏
Oh, no I see the play

124
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,880
你进去看戏 你看过她所有演出的戏剧吗?
You see the play? You've seen every performance of this play?

125
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,050
是的
Yes

126
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,470
但你不觉得
But don't you find it

127
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,800
这些花费太昂贵了吗?
Apart from everything else, don't you find it expensive?

128
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,060
站票不太贵,我还付得起
Standing room doesn't cost much I manage

129
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,310
-我带你去玛歌那里 -不行
-I'm gonna take you to Margo -Oh, no!

130
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,060
-行!她一定得见你 -不要 -在她面前我会不知所措
-Oh, yes She's got to meet you -No, I'd be imposing on her

131
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,230
我一定会讲不出话来
I'd be just another tongue-tied fan

132
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,570
再也找不到你这种人了 绝对不会
There isn't another like you There couldn't be

133
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,410
-下次好了,你看我这一身 -你看来很好呀!
If I'd known, Some other time. Looking like this

134
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,080
对了,你叫什么名字?
You look just fine By the way, what's your name?

135
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,250
伊芙.哈林顿
Eve Eve Harrington

136
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,000
瑞奇太太,你好
-Good evening, Gus -Good evening, Mrs Richards

137
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,920
-晚安! -晚安
-Good night -Good night, Gus

138
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,650
你可以闻到刺鼻的味道
You can breathe it, can't you?

139
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,360
如同神奇的香水般
Like some magic perfume

140
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,040
在这里等,别走开
Wait right here Don't run away

141
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,460
-嗨! -你好,音乐会如何?
"If the South had won, you could write plays about the North "

142
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,880
-柴先生,至少你能光明正大说
-Hi -Hello!

143
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,800
-我帮你倒杯喝的 -我不认为我们战败了
"I don't think you can rightly say we lost the war "

144
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,470
我们没得奖 是因为我们太先进了
"We was more starved out, you might say "

145
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,560
但我实在不明白,那些有关 南方女人的爱情故事
"I don't understand all these plays about love-starved Southern women "

146
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,230
只有对南方的爱,我们落伍了
"Love is one thing we were never starved for in the South "

147
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,900
玛歌接见一位南方的女记者
Margo's interview with a reporter from the South

148
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,320
只要这话一见报 他们又要从盖茨堡点燃战火
When it gets printed, they're gonna fire on Gettysburg again

149
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,400
再掀起一次南北战争 至少这是值得的 －我从不会为某种企图演戏
-It was Fort Sumter they fired on -I never played Fort Sumter

150
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,080
亲爱的罗维 做个有胆识的编剧
Honeychild had a point Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts

151
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,500
把我写成正常的好女人 而且只适合她的丈夫
Write me one about a nice, normal woman who just shoots her husband

152
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,080
-你不需要束腰吗? -去找一件
-You need new girdles -Buy some

153
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,080
-同样的尺寸? -当然
-Same size? -Of course

154
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,250
我越来越觉得 这些低级笑话并不好笑
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny

155
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,590
-“林中岁月”的确是一部叫座的好戏 -这才是我罗维的女人
-Aged in Wood happens to be a fine play -That's my loyal little woman

156
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,180
影评人是这么认为 观众当然也是这么认为
The critics thought so The audiences think so

157
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,850
大家争相来看 票四个月前就卖光了
Packed houses, tickets four months in advance

158
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,520
我看不出罗维的戏 会带给你任何伤害
I can't see that Lloyd's plays have hurt you any

159
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,690
放松，放松，又没有别人.天知地知，我知你知.
-Easy now -Relax, kid, it's just me and my big mouth

160
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,820
有时你实在让我很生气
You get me so mad sometimes

161
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,440
全世界女人没什么好抱怨的
Of all the women with nothing to complain about

162
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,700
-这是真的吗? -是的,这是真的
-Ain't it the truth? -Yes, it is

163
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,200
你有天份,有名气,有钱
You're talented, famous, wealthy

164
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,540
人们日夜的等待 就为见你一面,即使是刮风下雨的日子
People waiting around night after night just to see you Even in the rain

165
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,370
看看那场面,他们还是人吗?
Autograph fiends They're not people

166
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,040
他们就像跑在大街上的土狼
Little beasts that run around in packs like coyotes

167
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,960
他们是你的朋友,你的观众 -他们才不是我的朋友
-They're your fans -They're nobody's fans

168
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,880
是不良少年,神经病 才不是我的观众
They're juvenile delinquents They're nobody's audience

169
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,800
他们从未看过戏或是电影 他们在室内绝对待不久
They never see a play or a movie They're never indoors long enough

170
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,310
现在门外就有个观众
Well, there's one indoors right now

171
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,890
我将她带来见你 什么?
-I've brought her back to see you -You've what?

172
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,810
她就在门外
She's just outside the door

173
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,900
叫她走
The heave-ho

174
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,650
你不能把她赶走,我答应过她
But you can't put her out I promised

175
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,690
玛歌你得见她
Margo, you've got to see her

176
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,490
她好祟拜你 就好比童话故事一样
She worships you It's like something out of a book

177
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,160
那种故事早绝版了,凯伦,那种时代早过了
That book is out of print Those days are gone

178
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,500
只要你见她一面 你是她人生的全部
But if you'd only see her You're her whole life

179
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,330
你一定见过她 她总是在那里呀!
You must have spotted her by now She's always there

180
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,500
那鬼鬼祟祟家伙穿件破大衣 戴顶可笑帽子
Oh, the mousy one with the trench coat and the funny hat

181
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,670
-她每晚都在,我怎会错过呢!
How could I miss her? Every night, every matinee

182
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,350
进来吧，伊芙
Come in, Eve

183
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,270
-我还以为你已经忘了我 -才不会呢!
-I thought you'd forgotten about me -Not at all

184
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,520
-玛歌,这是伊芙.哈林顿 -你好,亲爱的
Margo, this is Eve Harrington

185
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,110
-天呀! -你好!嘉琳小姐
-How do you do, my dear? -Oh, brother

186
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,190
-我先生 -哈林顿小姐,你好
-Hello, Miss Channing -My husband

187
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,360
你好,瑞奇先生
-Hello, Miss Harrington -How do you do?

188
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,700
这位是我好友及随伴 柏蒂库门小姐
And this is my dear friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan

189
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,030
-我的天呀!
-Oh, brother -Miss Coonan

190
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,790
-库门小姐,什么我的天?看她这个样子
-Oh, brother, what? -When she gets like this,

191
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,040
突然扮成慈母的模样
she starts playing Hamlet's mother

192
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,960
柏蒂,我相信你在浴室 还有事要做吧!这个可爱的柏蒂
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie, dear

193
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,550
如果我没有，我仍然能找到什么办法把你变回来
If I haven't, I'll find something till you get normal

194
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,800
威林顿小姐,你请坐呀!
Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?

195
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,970
是哈林顿!-非常抱歉,哈林顿
Harrington

196
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,850
抱歉，坐下吗？谢谢.
-I'm so sorry Won't you sit down? -Thank you

197
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,390
-你要不要来点饮料？
Would you like a drink?

198
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,230
-一杯水？-我刚跟玛歌说你常去看她的戏
I was saying how often you've seen the play

199
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,820
不，谢谢.
No, thank you

200
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,820
是的,每场戏我都看过每一场戏?
Yes, I've seen every performance

201
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,240
那我猜你一定喜欢啰!
Every performance? Then am I safe in assuming you like it?

202
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,330
我喜欢嘉琳小姐 演出的每一场戏 你嘴巴真甜
-I'd like anything Miss Channing played in -Would you really? How sweet

203
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,580
我倒是很怀疑,你会喜欢 她那部“苦命女”?
I doubt very much that you'd like her in The Hairy Ape

204
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,500
瑞奇先生,请不要误解
Please don't misunderstand me, Mr Richards

205
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:04,340
我认为嘉琳小姐最伟大之处 在于她能依其所长 挑选出最好的戏来演
I think part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to pick the best plays

206
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,590
你新戏是为嘉琳小姐写的吧!
Your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it?

207
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,590
那当然了
Of course it is

208
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,350
你是怎么听来的? 是时代杂志上说的
-How did you hear about it? -There was an item in The Times

209
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,270
我喜欢那个片名 “天花板上的足迹”
I like the title, Footsteps on the Ceiling

210
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,350
我们再回头谈谈
Yes, but let's get back to this one

211
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,690
你真的看过她每部戏吗? 是的!
-Have you really seen every performance? -Yes

212
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,770
为什么?我很好奇
Why? I'm curious

213
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:28,400
如果我不去看戏 我就没有别的地方好去
Well, if I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go

214
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,360
总有别的戏呀!
There are other plays

215
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,200
那里可就没有你 也不是瑞奇先生编剧
Not with you in them Not by Mr Richards

216
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,750
但你总该有朋友或家庭吧!
But you must have friends, a home, family?

217
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,540
说说吧，伊芙
Tell us about it, Eve

218
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,800
-我不知该如何说起? -试试看嘛!
-If I only knew how -Try

219
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,470
这样
-Well -(door opens)

220
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,070
-事情是从上场戏开始 -“回忆”（片名）
Well, it started with the play before this one

221
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,490
“回忆”
-Remembrance -Remembrance

222
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,580
你是在这里,还是纽约看的? 在旧金山看的
-Did you see it here in New York? -San Francisco

223
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,160
在上星期一个晚上去看的
It was the last week I went one night

224
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,330
那是我一生最重要的一夜 直到现在
The most important night of my life, until now

225
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,500
我发觉我隔夜又去了 然后再隔夜,隔夜
I found myself going the next night and the next and the next

226
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,840
每场戏
Every performance

227
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,760
直到戏移到东部去演出 我也去了东部
Then, when the show went East, I went East

228
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,850
伊芙,你何不从头说起呢? -你们不会感兴趣的
-Eve, why don't you start at the beginning? -Oh, it couldn't possibly interest you

229
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,270
-请说吧!
Please

230
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,110
我想该从家乡说起 我是威斯康星州人
I guess it started back home Wisconsin, that is

231
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,530
家中有爸妈和我
It was just Mom and Dad and me

232
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,400
我是家里唯一的孩子
I was an only child

233
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,950
小时候时常去假扮很多东西
I used to make believe a lot when I was a kid

234
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:57,030
把各种东西都表演出来 这很重要吗?
Acted out all sorts of things What they were isn't important

235
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,210
总之,表演,假扮 越来越不能满足我
But, somehow, acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more

236
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,040
让我越来越不能分辨 什么是真,什么是假的
It got so I couldn't tell the real from the unreal

237
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,460
有时假的让我觉得更像真的.
Except that the unreal seemed more real to me

238
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,550
我好像在胡言乱语了,是吧? 一点也不
-I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I? -Not at all

239
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,220
那时的农人都很穷 父亲也是如此,他是个农夫
Farmers were poor in those days That's what Dad was, a farmer

240
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,480
我很讨厌农事
I had to help out

241
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:30,230
所以就休学 去密尔瓦基做秘书 在布威尔酒厂
So I quit school, went to Milwaukee, became a secretary in a brewery

242
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,570
在布威尔做秘书时,要假扮任何东西都很难
When you're a secretary in a brewery, it's hard to make believe you're anything else

243
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,660
什么事都跟啤酒有关
Everything is beer

244
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,660
并不是有趣的工作 不过倒是能贴补家用
It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home

245
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:48,090
就像是沙漠中的一滴甘露
And there was a little theatre group there, like a drop of rain on the desert

246
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,250
也因此我认识了艾迪
That's where I met Eddie

247
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,260
他是个无线电技工
He was a radio technician

248
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,050
我们演出过三场戏
We played Liliom for three performances

249
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,680
那时演得好糟
I was awful

250
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,350
然后大战来了,我们结了婚
Then the war came and we got married

251
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,520
艾迪投效了空军
Eddie was in the air force

252
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,110
他们派他去南太平洋
They sent him to the South Pacific

253
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,780
瑞奇先生,你也在OWI是吗?
You were with the OWI, weren't you, Mr Richards?

254
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,150
这是那个什么来着说的
That's what Who's Who says

255
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,280
他便是派到这支巡逻队 等爸死后,我又回到这里生活
Well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer

256
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,620
就除了每周收到他的信
Except for a letter a week

257
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,960
有一周他写信告诉我 他快休假了
One week he wrote me he had leave coming up

258
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:30,380
我就存点钱,积些假期 到旧金山去见他
I'd saved my money and vacation time and went to San Francisco to meet him

259
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,300
但艾迪却不在那里
But Eddie wasn't there

260
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,300
他们转来一封发自 密尔瓦基的电报
They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee

261
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,970
原本来自华盛顿的电报
The one that came from Washington

262
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,970
上面说艾迪再也不能来了,
To say that Eddie wasn't coming at all

263
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,980
艾迪死了
That Eddie was dead

264
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,570
当时我想留在旧金山算了
I figured I'd stay in San Francisco

265
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,110
我孤零零一个人 没有艾迪我也回不去
I was alone I couldn't go back without Eddie

266
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,080
我找到一份工作 是一家保险公司
I found a job, and his insurance helped

267
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,750
而旧金山也有戏院
And there were theatres in San Francisco

268
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:12,500
然后有一晚,玛歌.嘉琳的 “回忆”在此上演了,
And then, one night, Margo Channing came to play in Remembrance,

269
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,670
我就去看戏
and I went to see it

270
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,840
嗯
Well

271
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,090
因此我就到这里来了
Here I am

272
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,270
真是感人的故事 如过街老鼠般
What a story Everything but the bloodhounds snapping at her rear end

273
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,110
这其中有着一些人生经历 不要用俗话来作批评
There are some human experiences that do not take place in a vaudeville house!

274
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,490
即使是那些念到五年级的人 也懂得尊敬别人的道理
And that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect

275
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:46,330
-我代柏蒂向你道歉 -你不必为我道歉
-I want to apologize for Birdie -You don't have to apologize for me

276
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:54,380
如果我伤了你的心 我很抱歉 我说话就是这个样子
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings It's just my way of talking

277
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,130
库门太太,你没有
You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss Coonan

278
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,300
叫我柏蒂就行了
Call me Birdie

279
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,300
至于念到五年级
And as for being fifth-rate,

280
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,640
我念得比你知道的还多 我念到十一年级
I closed the first half for eleven years, and you know it

281
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,150
飞机已到了四十分钟 都还没准备好
47 minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you?

282
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,150
-看起来像是垃圾堆一样 -非常谢谢
-Not ready, looking like a junkyard -Thank you so much

283
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,660
这是怠工吗? 不把我的事业放在眼里吗?
Is it sabotage? Have you no human consideration?

284
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,580
-一点体谅的心都没有吗? -你说呢?我可能有的,飞机都守时的,你却没有
-Show me a human and I might have -Airlines have clocks, even if you don't

285
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,910
我从星期一起拍一礼拜的戏 杰妮卡她没耐性,她需要我
I start shooting a week from Monday Zanuck is impatient

286
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,170
杰妮卡,杰妮卡 你们两个是情侣吗?
Zanuck, Zanuck! What are you two? Lovers?

287
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,090
-在某方面你是比较漂亮 -我是垃圾堆吗?
-Only in some ways You're prettier -I'm a junkyard

288
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,510
-比尔导演,这位是伊芙.哈林顿 -你好
-Bill This is Eve Harrington -Hi

289
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:43,180
我美妙的垃圾堆,我梦中情人是在 垃圾堆中找到的
My wonderful junkyard The mystery and dreams you find in a junkyard

290
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,100
老天,快救我!
Heaven help me

291
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,260
我喜欢一个神经病
I love a psychotic

292
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,020
你好!你叫什么名字? 伊芙,伊芙.哈林顿
-Hello What's your name? -Eve Harrington

293
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,690
-你们早见过了 -在那里?
-You've already met -Huh? Where?

294
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,900
-就在这里,一分钟前 -那很好啊!
-Right here, just a minute ago -That's nice

295
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,120
你不是想走吧! 我想我最好都已经
-You're not going, are you? -I think I'd better

296
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,870
我实在是说不出来
It's been I can hardly find the words to say how it's been

297
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
不,别走
No, don't go

298
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,040
你们四人一定有好多话要说 关于辛普生要远行的事
The four of you must have so much to say to each other with Mr Sampson leaving

299
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,380
请留下来,告诉你原因
No, stick around, please

300
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:26,720
我们先安排史丹劳斯基的演出 你和我再找个地方谈谈
Tell you what We'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, then go somewhere and talk

301
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,560
-如果我不碍事的话
Well, if I'm not in the way

302
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,770
-不会的
I won't be a minute

303
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,900
-罗维,我们该走了 -是呀!
Lloyd, we've got to go

304
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,820
晚安!玛歌
Good night, Margo

305
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,820
-明天打电话给你 -别太早了
-I'll call you tomorrow -Not too early

306
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,000
-祝你好运,导演 -天才不需要好运的 而我需要
-Good luck, genius -Geniuses don't need good luck I do

307
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,840
-我不担心你 -保有这种想法
-I'm not worried about you -Keep the thought

308
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,170
晚安,伊芙 希望很快再见到你
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon

309
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,260
-明天我还会站在那老地方 -不是以这种方式 而是以朋友的方式
-I'll be at the old stand tomorrow matinee -Not just that way As a friend

310
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,430
我喜欢这样
I'd like that

311
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,270
-你真是个令人愉快的人 -但愿如此,瑞奇先生 -晚安
-It's been a real pleasure, Eve -I hope so, Mr Richards Good night

312
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,690
晚安
Good night

313
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,690
瑞奇太太
Mrs Richards?

314
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,690
只要活着,
I'll never forget this night as long as I live

315
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,200
我永远不会忘记
And I'll never forget you for making it possible

316
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,460
我也永远不会忘记你,伊芙
(Karen) And I'll never forget you, Eve

317
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,790
那晚我和罗维去了哪里呢?
Where were we going that night, Lloyd and I?

318
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,460
真奇怪,该记住的事
Funny, the things you remember

319
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,380
反倒忘了
and the things you don't

320
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:56,020
因此你要去好莱坞吗?
-So you're going to Hollywood? -Mm-hm

321
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,230
-为何这么问? -我只是奇怪
-Why? -I just wondered

322
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,320
只是奇怪什么? 为什么呢?
-Just wondered what? -Why?

323
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,530
什么为什么? 为何你要离开到那里去?
-Why what? -Why you have to go out there

324
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,200
不是必须要,是我想要 为了钱吗?
-I don't have to I want to -Is it the money?

325
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,370
百分之八十都纳税走了
80% of it'll go for taxes

326
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,250
那是为了什么呢? 一位年轻杰出的戏剧导演 又为了什么?
Then why? Why, if you're the most successful young director in the theatre

327
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,920
戏剧,戏剧
The theatre The theatre

328
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,670
哪本书规定导演只能存在
What rules say the theatre exists only within some ugly buildings

329
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,510
纽约的方圆一哩内 挤在几间破旧的大楼里
crowded into one square mile of New York City?

330
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,720
应该到巴黎或维也纳
Or London, Paris or Vienna?

331
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,350
你听着,年轻人也想学习
Listen, Junior, and learn

332
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,360
你想知道戏剧是什么? 马戏团,歌剧也是
Do you wanna know what the theatre is? A flea circus Also opera

333
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,190
马术大赛也是 嘉年华会,芭蕾
Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets,

334
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,530
印地安人部落集会 单人乐队等,都是戏剧
Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band, all theatre

335
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:55,620
只要能弄假成真的戏法 能有观众来看的都叫戏剧
Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience, there's theatre

336
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,790
唐老鸭,还有独行侠
Donald Duck, Ibsen and The Lone Ranger

337
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,210
莎拉 伯哈顿 幸运泉,贝蒂 葛莱宝
Sarah Bernhardt and Poodles Hanneford Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable

338
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,420
红老马,仙纳 杜雪 这都是戏剧
Rex the Wild Horse, Eleonora Duse, all theatre

339
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,970
你根本就不了解 你也不一定都喜欢
You don't understand them all You don't like them all
359

340
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,050
那你为何要看呢?
Why should you?

341
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,180
戏剧是属于大家的,也包括你 但不是专属于你个人
The theatre's for everybody, you included, but not exclusively

342
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,890
有些人欣赏,有些人反对
So, don't approve or disapprove

343
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,810
或许不是你要的戏剧 可是总是属于某人的戏剧
It may not be your theatre, but it's theatre for somebody, somewhere

344
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,440
我只问你一个简单的问题
I just asked a simple question

345
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,240
那我闭嘴好了
And I shot my mouth off

346
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,410
非专业的初学者没什么
Nothing personal, Junior No offense

347
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:37,830
只是太多中产阶级及外行人 他们所称的戏剧
It's just that there's so much bushwa in this ivory greenroom they call the theatre,

348
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,330
有时真该说他们两句
sometimes it gets up around my chin

349
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,830
但好莱坞,你要远离那里
But Hollywood You mustn't stay out there

350
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,630
-只不过拍一部影片 -所以你要回来
-It's only a one-picture deal -So few come back

351
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,590
我每周阅读乔治内幕报导
I read George Jean Nathan every week

352
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,100
-以及专家报导? -每天都看
-Also Addison DeWitt -Every day

353
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,680
这点不必跟我说
-You didn't have to tell me -(door opens)

354
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,850
我了解戴一只耳环是很懒散的
It's the latest thing, one earring

355
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,940
不过也没办法 我找不到另一只
If it isn't, it's going to be I can't find the other one

356
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,530
你又到处乱放了
Throw that dreary letter away It bores me

357
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,860
-那会放哪里去呢? -它一定会出现的
-Where do you suppose it could be? -It'll show up

358
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,120
我放弃了!走道上看看 或许你会捡到一个2毛5
Oh, I give up Look in the wigs Maybe it got caught in one

359
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,040
每个礼拜掉一颗真钻 我们过得真慷慨呀!
Real diamonds in a wig The world we live in

360
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,040
-我的大衣呢? -就在你脱衣服的地方
-Where's my coat? -Right where you left it

361
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,380
丝袜!
The seams

362
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,880
-他就目不转睛注视我双腿
He can't take his eyes off my legs

363
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,050
-如同贴身丝袜一样
Like a nylon lemon peel

364
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,300
就算拜伦也无法说得那么优雅
Byron couldn't have said it more graciously

365
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,470
好了!我们走吧!
Here we go

366
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,020
有什么话要说吗?
Got any messages?

367
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,140
要我向泰隆鲍华说些什么?
What do you want me to tell Tyrone Power?

368
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,560
只要给我他的电话号码 我会自己说的
Just give him my phone number I'll tell him myself

369
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,320
好好照顾他们
Kill the people

370
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,570
-你的锁匙拿了吧! -回家见!
-You got your key? -See you at home

371
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,410
我有个建议 时间不是不太够吗?
I have a suggestion There's really not very much time left

372
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,250
我是说你们好久不见了
I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet

373
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,750
我可以照料这一切 待会在入口处碰面就行了
And I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket,

374
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,840
你们觉得怎么样?
if you'd like

375
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,840
-我们很乐意,
I think we'd like very much

376
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,430
-Sure you won't mind? -Of course not
真的不介意? -当然不会

377
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:31,440
她真是个伶巧的女孩 叫什么名字? 伊芙,我忘了他们 是那么长大的
-She's quite a girl, this whatshername -Eve I'd forgotten they grew that way

378
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:35,610
说真的 她倒是有一种天生的慧根
That lack of pretense, that strange directness and understanding

379
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,360
她是否跟你谈到戏剧? 你有何高见?
Did she tell you about the theatre and what it meant?

380
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,870
不,我跟她盖了一大堆
No, I told her I sounded off

381
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,950
天下万教殊途同归
All the religions in the world rolled into one,

382
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,460
而上帝还是上帝
and we're gods and goddesses

383
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,210
你说这好不好笑? 突然我有一种 想保护她的念头
Isn’t it silly? Suddenly I've developed a big, protective feeling toward her

384
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,050
她像只迷失在丛林的羔羊
A lamb loose in our big, stone jungle

385
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,890
你自己多保重 我明白他们有着 像印地安人的陷阱
-Take care of yourself out there -They have the Indians pretty well in hand

386
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,140
比尔,
Bill

387
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,350
别迷上那些狐狸精 我尽量
-Don't get stuck on some glamour puss -I'll try

388
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,150
跟她们打交道,你既粗心 又不会说话,斗不过她们的
You're not much of a bargain You're conceited, thoughtless and messy

389
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:17,490
-不是每个人都像格里高利.派克 -年轻貌美又狂野的女子 是你最想要的
-Everybody can't be Gregory Peck -You're a setup for some young babe

390
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,070
你怎么说这种孩子气的话
How childish are you gonna get before you stop it?

391
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,910
我才没有 这几年我早就定下心了
I don't wanna be childish I'd settle for a few years

392
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,160
那就别再说了
And cut that out right now

393
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,330
比尔,我会失去你吗? 我会吗?
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?

394
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,830
-此刻你才六岁大而已
As of this moment, you're six years old

395
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,670
-已经好了
All ready

396
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,770
谢谢你的帮忙,祝你好运
Thanks for your help Good luck

397
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,020
再见!辛普森先生
Goodbye, Mr Sampson

398
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:57,030
-你会到马佛吗? -你到了以后打个电话给我
-Knit me a muffler? -Call me when you get in

399
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,880
年轻人
(Bill) Hey, Junior!

400
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,340
看着她点,别让她寂寞
Keep your eye on her Don't let her get lonely

401
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,380
她是只丛林里迷失的羔羊
She's a loose lamb in a jungle

402
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,550
别担心
Don't worry

403
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:41,070
就在那一晚 我们整理伊芙的东西
(Margo) That same night, we sent for Eve's things, her few pitiful possessions

404
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,700
她的日用品搬进顶楼那房间
She moved into the little guest room on the top floor

405
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,460
在接下来的三个礼拜中
The next three weeks were out of a fairy tale,

406
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,000
我就如同灰姑娘般 得到格外的礼遇
and I was Cinderella in the last act

407
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,760
伊芙变成我姐妹,律师,母亲 朋友,心理医生以及警察
Eve became my sister, lawyer, mother, friend, psychiatrist and cop

408
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,590
蜜月开始了
The honeymoon was on

409
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,330
-再来一次吗?
One more?

410
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,500
-要不是为了清场
From now on it isn't applause,

411
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,920
我都想躺到地板去了
just something to do till the aisles get cleared

412
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,840
什么，再来？
What, again?

413
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:28,140
看你最后一幕表演上千遍 但每次还是会哭
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times, cry every time

414
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,010
这出戏从来没演过那么久
Performance number 1,000 of this one, if I play it that long,

415
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,480
这么做不被认为傻瓜才怪
will take place in a well-padded booby hatch

416
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:42,530
我要说你该告诉辛普森先生 他电话打了一个月了
I must say, you can certainly tell Mr Sampson's been gone a month

417
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,690
你当然可以这么说
You certainly can

418
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:48,610
明早之前他会再打电话给我
Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning

419
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,950
你买的新束腰太小了 我感觉得出来
You bought the new girdles a size smaller I can feel it

420
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,540
也许里面什么东西变大了
Something maybe grew a size larger

421
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,120
我看回家你来穿这束腰 试个两个半小时看会如何?
You can get into one of those girdles and act for two and a half hours

422
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,840
我花两个半小时 也穿不进这束腰的
I couldn't get into the girdle in two and a half hours

423
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,220
你没注意到我最近的新创意
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating

424
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,060
但你已经做了很多了 又有什么新创举?
(Margo) But you've done so much What's new?

425
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,640
窗帘,是我自己做的
The curtains I made them myself

426
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,570
它们很可爱-柏蒂,它们可爱吗?
They're lovely Aren't they lovely, Birdie?

427
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,070
-太可爱了
Adorable

428
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:28,320
现在所有东西都是手工做的 除了篮球架之外
We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop

429
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,740
还不是因你连脱鞋都不会做
Just because you can't even work a zipper!

430
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,240
伊芙,你很有创意 我很欣赏
It was very thoughtful of you, Eve I appreciate it

431
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,160
趁你在卸妆,我把戏服 送去服装间
I'll just take this to the wardrobe mistress

432
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,620
-别麻烦,布朗太太会来拿
Don't bother Mrs Brown will be along soon

433
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,580
-一点也不麻烦
No trouble at all

434
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,090
我可大胆对你说些事吗?
May I be so bold as to say something?

435
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,930
你听过“工会”这个字吗? -照你的行情,那该多少?
-Have you ever heard of the word "union"? -Behind in your dues? How much?

436
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:57,430
-我没有工会,我是个奴隶
-I haven't got a union I'm slave labor -Well?

437
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,690
可是管服装的女人 可是加入了工会
But the wardrobe women have got one and, next to a tenor,

438
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,360
在演艺界最不能惹的 就是管服装的女人
a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business

439
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,950
她只做两件事 不是带走,就是摆错地方
She's got two things to do: carry clothes and press 'em wrong

440
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:12,280
千万别让人说闲话了
And don't let anybody try to muscle in

441
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,300
最好让布朗太太来收戏服
We'd better let Mrs Brown pick up the wardrobe

442
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,000
喂
(phone rings)Hello

443
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,080
我们已经帮你接通 比佛利山庄的电话了
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills

444
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,420
什么电话? 这里是89970 玛歌.嘉琳住宅吗?
-Call? What call? -Is this Templeton 89970? Miss Channing?

445
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,750
是的,我了解了
Yes, it is, but I don't understand

446
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,050
我们准备替你转接加州 辛普森先生电话,
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time,

447
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,930
你愿付费吗
to Mr Sampson

448
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,850
-我付 -请说吧!
-I placed? -Go ahead, please

449
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,520
-玛歌,好棒的惊喜
(Bill) Margo, what a wonderful surprise

450
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,940
-玛歌,好棒的惊喜 -你真是体贴呀!
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do

451
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,610
比尔,我是不是疯了?
Bill Have I gone crazy, Bill?

452
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,360
-你是我的乖女孩 -我是吗?
-You're my girl, aren't you? -That I am

453
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,530
那么你是疯了
Then you're crazy

454
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,870
你何时回来? 再一礼拜吧!
-When are you coming back? -I leave in a week

455
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:39,700
影片都拍好了 昨晚我们试片了
The picture's wrapped up We previewed last night

456
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,040
哦，哪些试片
Oh, those previews

457
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,210
那场试片在市郊公演 但还是很恐怖,一点办法也没有
Like opening out of town, but terrifying There's nothing you can do

458
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,460
都动弹不得,就像在锡罐中
You're trapped You're in a tin can

459
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,220
锡罐中?那么快脱身吧! 我要你回家来
In a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home

460
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,140
要很快吗? 要很快,所以就快一点吧!
-You in a hurry? -In a big hurry, so be quick about it

461
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,140
再见,达令,好好睡哦!
Goodbye, darling Sleep tight

462
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,190
等等,不能挂呀! 我们还没说话耶!
Hey, wait a minute You haven't even said it yet

463
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:10,230
比尔,别现在嘛! 你知道我工作多累呀!
Oh, now, Bill You know how much I do, but over a phone

464
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,400
你真是的!真是孩子气
Now, really That's kids' stuff

465
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:17,240
我又不是天天这样 我只想听你讲话嘛!
Kids' stuff or not It doesn't happen every day and I wanna hear it

466
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,410
如果你不想说,我就用唱的 用唱的?
-And if you won't say it, you can sing it -Sing it?

467
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,410
当然,就像西城工会的人
Sure, like the Western Union boys used to do

468
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,710
比尔,
Bill

469
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,760
今天是你的生日
It's your birthday

470
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,010
你还记得吗? 总是在那半夜12点
And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot at 12 midnight?

471
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,010
生日快乐,达令
Happy birthday, darling

472
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,520
你可再说得好一点呀!
The reading could've been better, but you said it

473
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,850
所有的快乐都回归到这一天
Now, "Many happy returns of the day "

474
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,850
所有的快乐都回归到这一天
Many happy returns of the day

475
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:53,940
我会有个生日派对? 当然 生日,记得回家
-I get a party, don't I? -Of course Birthday and coming home

476
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:57,950
-我该请谁来? -那不是秘密,我知道 伊芙替我买了生日礼物
-Who will I ask? -I know all about the party Eve wrote me

477
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,620
她做的吗? 是的,一礼拜前我收到了
-She did? -She hasn't missed a week since I left

478
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,450
一周前你也许告诉她要写些什么了吧
But you know that You probably tell her what to write

479
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,370
反正我把派对名单寄给她了 你和她核对一下
I sent her a list of guests, so check with her

480
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,960
我会的!
Yeah, I will

481
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,630
-她好吗? -很好!
-How is Eve? OK? -OK

482
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,470
-我爱你 -我也会查的
-I love you -I'll check with Eve

483
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,050
-什么? -我也爱你!
I love you, too Good night, darling

484
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,470
晚安!
See ya

485
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,600
柏蒂
-Birdie -Hm?

486
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,940
你不喜欢伊芙,是吗?
You don't like Eve, do you?

487
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,280
你是要吵架,还是答案呢?
You want an argument or an answer?

488
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,030
-给我答案 -不喜欢!
-An answer -No

489
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,620
-为什么? -现在你想吵架
-Why not? -Now you want an argument

490
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,870
-她工作卖力 -日以继夜
-She works hard -Night and day

491
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:31,330
-她忠实又有效率 -就像只有一个客户的经纪人
-She's loyal and efficient -Like an agent with only one client

492
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,710
她只为我个人着想
She thinks only of me,

493
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,550
不是吗?
doesn't she?

494
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,130
我想她只为她自己着想
Well, let's say she thinks only about ya, anyway

495
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,220
你这话是怎么说? 我告诉你她如何?
-How do you mean that? -I'll tell ya how

496
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,890
就像
Like

497
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,980
就像她在研究你
Like she's studying you

498
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,230
就像在研究你的戏 做笔记,阅读你的书
Like you was a play, or a book, or a set of blueprints

499
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,560
研究你如何走路,讲话 吃东西,思考
How you walk, talk, eat, think

500
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,730
我确知这是很会拍马屁 但我不觉得有什么不对
I'm sure that's flattering There's nothing wrong with it

501
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,360
早安!
(knock on door)

502
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,410
你觉得我穿上你高雅衣服如何
Good morning Well, what do you think of my elegant new suit?

503
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,910
非常合身,比我穿要好看多了
It looks much better on you than it did on me

504
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,830
我实在无法相信 你知道我只要修改一下就行了
I can imagine All it needed was a little taking in here and letting out there

505
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,460
你确定真的不想穿吗?
Are you sure you won't want it yourself?

506
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:18,090
很肯定,我觉得这对我来说 太年轻了些
Quite sure I find it too seventeenish for me

507
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,510
得了,你又不是老女人
Come now, as though you were an old lady

508
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,090
我现在要去办事 你还想到有什么事吗?
I'm on my way Is there anything else?

509
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,590
-你把剧本送回去协会 -我拿了
-That script to take to the Guild -I've got it

510
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,180
-还有开出支票预付所得税
And those checks for the income-tax man

511
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,390
-我带了
Right here

512
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,190
看来我想到的事 你早就想到了
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of

513
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:37,020
那是我的工作 午茶时再见
That's my job See you at teatime

514
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,030
伊芙
Eve?

515
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:46,740
你是否曾代我打电话给比尔? 在加州的午夜时刻
Did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?

516
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:51,040
老天!我竟然给忘了 -是的,你全忘了
-Golly, I forgot to tell you! -Yes, dear, you forgot all about it

517
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,960
当然,我知道你一定很想 在他生日那天打电话给他
I was sure you'd want to, being his birthday

518
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,880
这几天你一直都很忙,昨晚你和瑞奇先生外出时 我本想告诉你
You've been so busy lately Last night I meant to tell you before you went out

519
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,550
后来想等你回来再说 但是我睡着了
I guess I was asleep when you got home

520
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,970
我信得过你,你做事很细心
Yes, I guess you were It was very thoughtful of you, Eve

521
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,140
辛普森先生的生日 我怎能忘记呢?
Mr Sampson's birthday, I couldn't forget that

522
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,640
你一定不会原谅我的
You'd never forgive me

523
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,610
事实上 我自己还拍了电报给他
As a matter of fact, I sent him a telegram myself

524
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:52,100
欢迎比尔回家的生日派对 是一个历史的转折夜
(Margo) Bill's welcome-home birthday party, a night to go down in history

525
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,770
即使在派对还未开始之前 我都可感觉到会有事情发生
Even before the party started, I could smell disaster in the air

526
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:02,520
我早就知道,我很敏感 当我盛装之后就感觉到
I knew it I sensed it even as I finished dressing for that blasted party

527
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,650
-你都弄好了吗? -我后面拉链开了
-You all put together? -My back's open

528
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,700
他们有没有特别帮你? 大家都很卖面子
-Extra help get here? -There's some characters

529
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,700
尤其贝克 巴特勒, 还有那个叫威廉的经纪人
dressed as maids and butlers Did you call the William Morris Agency?

530
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,040
不好笑,我还不至没那行情 食物怎么样?
You're not funny Actors would cost less How about the food?

531
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,790
包办宴食的人回去拿开胃菜
The caterer had to go back for the hors d'oeuvres

532
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,710
那个法国佬可是教了你不少
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot

533
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,720
他真是无所不知
There was nothing he didn't know

534
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,720
酒保说,
There's a message from the bartender

535
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:39,480
嘉琳小姐订了琴酒 是不是搞错了?
"Does Miss Channing know that she ordered domestic gin by mistake?"

536
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,400
唯一订错的大概只有宾客
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests

537
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,480
跟他说,别在乎他们喝多少 只要不烧起来便行了
They don't care what they drink as long as it burns

538
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:48,490
-比尔迟到了? -什么迟到?
-Where's Bill? He's late -Late for what?

539
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,860
-我们要在派对上开舞呢!
Don't be dense The party

540
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,830
-他20分钟前就到了
I ain't dense He's been here for 20 minutes

541
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,910
那就奇怪了,怎么不上来呢?
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up to

542
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,180
你就别担心那些摄影师了
-(laughter) -The cameraman said,

543
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:21,440
即使他们也会看走眼
"Even DeMille couldn't see anything looking through the wrong end!" So

544
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,610
可别怪我挑剔 这种故事不适合成年人
Don't let me kill the point Or isn't it a story for grown-ups?

545
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,940
你听过的 当初我对你也是看走眼了
You've heard it I looked through the wrong end of the camera

546
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:32,110
这倒提醒我告诉你 当初我看起来是多么纯洁
Remind me to tell you about the time I looked into the heart of an artichoke

547
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,700
我倒想听听看 -这些事我不记得了
-I'd like to hear it -Some snowy night in front of the fire

548
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,870
现在我们来讨论一下问题,伊芙,你去查一下开胃菜
Meanwhile, would you check about the hors d'oeuvres, Eve?

549
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,290
或许他们忘了加热或什么的
The caterer forgot them The varnish wasn't dry or something

550
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,460
好的
Of course

551
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,470
看来我有个盛大的派对?
Looks like I'm going to have a fancy party

552
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,390
-我还以为你会迟到 -我是上宾吗?
-I thought you were going to be late -Well, I'm guest of honor

553
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,560
我真没想到你已经到了
I had no idea you were even here

554
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,820
伊芙在我上楼途中告诉我 你在更衣
I ran into Eve and she told me you were dressing

555
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,400
以前你从未留步呀!
That's never stopped you before

556
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,490
她一开口就跟我说 她想知道好莱坞的事 她似乎很感兴趣
She wanted to know about Hollywood She seemed so interested

557
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,660
她是个有很多兴趣的女孩 -在这年头是相当难得的美德
-She's a girl of so many interests -It's a pretty rare quality these days

558
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,170
这女孩还有相当多难得的美德 -她似乎是如此
-A girl of so many rare qualities -So she seems

559
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,580
难怪你常称赞她了
So you've pointed out so often

560
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,670
说她有多好
So many qualities so often

561
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,090
她的忠实,效率,卖力 而且又年轻 既年轻又美丽
Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth and affection, and so young

562
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,260
既年轻又美丽
So young and so fair

563
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,430
我无法相信你会编出这些话
I can't believe you're making this up

564
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,680
这根本就像低级闹剧一样
It sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play

565
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:45,600
低级闹剧?你这么认为吗? 在我面前你可是一流的
Clyde Fitch, though you may not think so, was well before my time

566
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,690
我一向不否认 依美国人习性会对此吃惊的
I always deny that you were in Our American Cousin

567
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,030
林肯被刺的那天晚上
the night Lincoln was shot

568
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,110
我不认为这有什么好笑 这当然好笑
-I don't think that's funny -Of course it is

569
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,780
真是可笑到极点
This is all too laughable to be anything else

570
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,280
你知道我的感觉吗?我觉得你是不是到更年期了
You know what I feel about your age obsession

571
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:01,160
现在你这可笑的个性
And this getting into a jealous froth

572
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,210
你在为我跟个十岁孩子 聊十分钟吃什么醋?
because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid

573
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,710
-20分钟 -30,40好了
-20! -30 minutes, 40 minutes What of it?

574
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:08,290
天真无邪,那正是少女特性
Stage-struck She's a young lady of qualities

575
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:12,380
我已厌烦她,还有她特性
And I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities

576
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,880
阅读我剧本,为我做笔记
Studying me as if I were a play or a blueprint

577
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,970
我如何走路,思考 表演,睡觉
How I walk, talk, think, act, sleep

578
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,890
你怎么可以大发脾气 就为那孩子想做得尽善尽美
How can you take offense at a kid trying to be like her ideal?

579
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,520
别再称她是孩子
Stop calling her a kid

580
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,820
对了,不过有个人要求我
As it happens, there are particular aspects of my life

581
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:35,150
保持一付唯我独尊的样子
to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges

582
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,490
比方说什么呢? 比方说,你呀!
-For instance, what? -For instance, you

583
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:44,660
我现在任务该把你拥入怀里
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you

584
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,580
但我不想这么做,我很生气
But I'm not going to I'm too mad

585
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,250
是罪恶感 是生气
-Guilty! -Mad!

586
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,040
达令,你有某些个性相当出名 不管是
There are certain characteristics for which you are famous,

587
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,500
在台上或台下
on stage and off

588
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:57,090
虽然有些个性是我喜欢的 但也有些我不喜欢
I love you for some and in spite of others I haven't let those become too important

589
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:01,850
那些个性成为我重要的部分,它们是你的利器之一 使你能立于不败之地
They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is called "our environment"

590
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:04,520
若你非得伶牙利齿,可以
You have to keep your teeth sharp, all right

591
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,520
但我绝不让你对我刻薄说话 或是对伊芙
But I will not have you sharpen them on me, or on Eve

592
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:12,190
那她寻我开心怎么说? 还有煽动 -她根本没有,你晓得的
-What about her teeth? Her fangs? -She hasn't cut them yet and you know it!

593
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,360
你开始幻想一个有梦想的孩子
So when you start judging an idealistic, dreamy-eyed kid

594
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,490
会在灯红酒绿的社会中胡来
by the bar-room, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society,

595
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,700
我绝不同意
I won't have it!

596
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,370
伊芙从未对我说过话 只有建议,只有对你的崇拜
Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion

597
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:29,040
及对我们美满爱情的羡慕
indicated anything to me but adoration for you and happiness at our being in love

598
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,210
对我来说这不是吃醋
To intimate anything else

599
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:34,000
倒是一种狂妄与缺乏安全感 的举动,你该感到惭愧
spells a paranoiac insecurity that you should be ashamed of

600
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,420
停,她没有一样是真的
Cut Print it What happens in the next reel?

601
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:39,130
真的是我在无理取闹吗?
Do I get dragged off to the snake pits?

602
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,300
嘉琳小姐
(Eve) Miss Channing?

603
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,640
开胃菜到了!还有什么事要我做吗?
The hors d'oeuvres are here Is there anything else I can do?

604
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:55,070
谢谢你,伊芙 给我来杯马丁尼,纯的
Thank you, Eve I'd like a martini, very dry

605
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,280
我来倒!
I'll get it

606
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,820
你要喝什么? 一杯奶昔
-What'll you have? -A milk shake?

607
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:05,450
一杯马丁尼,纯的,麻烦你
A martini, very dry, please

608
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,750
-女士快点,宴会开始了 -比尔,你好
-The party's on the first floor -Hi, Bill

609
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,170
-你好,瑞奇太太 -亲爱的
-Hello, Mrs Richards -How are you, dear?

610
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,090
-你好伊芙 -晚上好瑞奇先生 -你好法宾先生
Good evening, Mr Richards, Mr Fabian

611
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,510
-大衣给我,好吗? -不用麻烦,我自己来
-May I have your coat? -I'll take it up

612
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,680
-让我来吧! -谢谢!
-Please -Thank you

613
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,350
-大家好 -你好
-Hi -Hi, Margo

614
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,930
-房子布置得很棒! -谢谢 -我喜欢那女孩
-The house looks lovely -I like that girl

615
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,190
气质很高雅
That quality of quiet graciousness

616
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,110
这只是她众多优点之一
Among so many quiet qualities

617
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,110
来吧!
Shall we?

618
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,360
玛歌你收容伊芙 是让我最快乐的事 -你高兴我就高兴了
-It's made me so happy your taking Eve in -I'm so happy you're happy

619
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:44,950
你们从未真正做过生意
You haven't been running a settlement house exactly

620
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,620
但都很有眼光
The kid has earned her way

621
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,370
你们得试试
You had a mixed-up inventory when she took over

622
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,790
默林零售商就买下不少了
Merchandise laying all over the shop

623
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:55,790
你要玛歌去做那些毛头小利
-You mixed Margo up with a five-and-ten -Make it Bergdorf Goodman

624
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,720
也许是个好主意 反正现在电影也玩不起来了
Everything on its proper shelf, eh, Max? All done up in little ribbons

625
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,800
现在就算我死了 也没人会在意的
I could die right now and nobody'd be confused

626
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,140
-麦斯,你呢? -我怎么了?
-How about you, Max? -How about me what?

627
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,390
要是你突然死了 你的财产要怎么办?
Suppose you dropped dead What about your inventory?

628
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:12,730
我不会突然死掉,现在不会
I ain't going to drop dead Not with the heat

629
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,560
这段谈话真是愉快
This is the most ghoulish conversation

630
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:17,820
-谢谢你 -没什么
-Thank you -Nothing

631
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,900
-麦斯!

632
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,400
-谢飞!

633
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:26,910
那孩子很快就会下来了 还是你想拿上去也可以
"The kid" will be down in a minute, unless you'd like to take her drink up to her

634
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,830
我知道该怎么做 -凯伦,给你

635
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,750
气氛好像很凝重
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish

636
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,920
发生什么事了? -他在说什么?
-What has or is about to happen? -What is he talking about?

637
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:40,510
-气氛凝重 -我们了解你,以前就发生过
-Macbeth -We've seen you like this before

638
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,090
事情是结束,还是才开始呢?
Is it over or is it just beginning?

639
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:56,900
绑好你们的安全带 这将会是个动荡的一夜
Fasten your seat belts It's going to be a bumpy night

640
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,110
-玛歌达令 -你好吗? -小姐!

641
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,990

-也很高兴见到你

643
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,790
我记得名单中好像没有你 你来做什么?
I remember, Addison, crossing you off my guest list What are you doing here?

644
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:16,210
你这令人难忘的小淘气 别再玩把戏了!
Dear Margo, you were an unforgettable Peter Pan You must play it again soon

645
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,790
-你记得凯丝维小姐吗? -不记得,你好!
-Remember Miss Casswell? -I do not How do you do?

646
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,050
我们没碰过面 -凯丝维小姐,是个演员
-We've never met Maybe that's why -She is an actress

647
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:25,470
库克班纳戏剧学院毕业生

648
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,890

00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:32,390
-晚安,杜维特先生 -你们两位认识啊!
-Good evening, Mr DeWitt -I had no idea you knew each other

650
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,230
上次荣幸谋面后 一错身竟已过了这么久
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction

651
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:40,150
你不也是一错身 就认识我吗?
-Until now, we've only met in passing -That's how you met me In passing

652
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,730
伊芙,这位是杜先生的老友 他的母亲
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr DeWitt's mother

653
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:46,240
凯丝维小姐 她是哈林顿 -凯丝维小姐 -你好
-Miss Casswell, Miss Harrington -How do you do?

654
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,240
我看你很想跟伊芙小姐叙叙
I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time

655
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:52,410
那我是恭敬不如从命
Your timidity must have kept you from mentioning it

656
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,910
-你该听听她对戏剧的高见 -那我们倒是有相同的喜好
-You know of her interest in the theatre? -We have that in common

657
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,920
那你们两个可以长谈了
Then you two must have a long talk

658
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
我想谈得太久 杜先生会觉得乏味的
I'm afraid Mr DeWitt would find me boring before too long

659
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:04,590
这你不必担心,或许你连 说话机会都没有
You won't bore him, honey You won't even get a chance to talk

660
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,800
亲爱的,你过来一下
Claudia, come here

661
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,760
你看那个人是制片人麦斯
You see that man? That's Max Fabian, the producer

662
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:14,180
过去好好自我推销一下
Now, go and do yourself some good

663
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:17,020
为何他们总像不快乐的兔子
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?

664
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,860
他们一向都是如此的 过去让他们开心一下
Cos that's what they are Now go and make him happier

665
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:27,950
你别担心?小迷人 她会很安全的
Now, don't worry about your little charge She'll be in safe hands

666
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:40,830

00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,010
-弹“放荡者” -我刚弹过

669

-那么就弹第五遍吧!
Then this will be five

670
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:40,100
你的那么多宾客不知道 你何时开舞呢?
Many of your guests are wondering when they may be permitted to view the body

671
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:44,440
而舞会在哪开呢? 舞会还没开
-Where has it been laid out? -It hasn't been laid out

672
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,780
我们酒没喝完
We haven't finished with the embalming

673
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,860
事实上你看到的玛歌.嘉琳
As a matter of fact, you're looking at it

674
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,780
只是她遗留的躯体
The remains of Margo Channing

675
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,790
呆坐着
sitting up

676
00:47:56,870 --> 00:48:00,370
我的遗言是要坐着被埋葬
It is my last wish to be buried sitting up

677
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,960
你就没有更自然的姿势吗?
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?

678
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,380
你对感情不了解 自然或不自然的 是没有感情吧!
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural

679
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,130
你的宾客都诧异着
Your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be

680
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,550
能否 弹奏较愉快的歌
a shade more on the, shall we say, happier side?

681
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,890
如果我的宾客不喜欢听
If my guests do not like it here,

682
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:20,230
我建议你和他们去疗养中心
I suggest they accompany you to the nursery

683
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:24,150
不然,我确信你们都会有 宾至如归的感觉
where I'm sure you will all feel more at home

684
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:29,230
玛歌,家里有小苏打吗?
Margo, you by any chance haven't got any bicarbonate of soda in the house?

685
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,650
可怜的麦斯,火烧心啊!
Poor Max Heartburn?

686
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,160
是因为凯丝维小姐吗?
It's that Miss Casswell

687
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,410
我不明白她为何不会令 艾德生火烧心?
I don't see why she hasn't given Addison heartburn

688
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,750
无心可痛呀!
No heart to burn

689
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:45,170
每个人都有颗心 除了某些人
Everybody has a heart, except some people

690
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:48,500
我当然有小苏打
Of course I've got bicarb

691
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:51,090
厨房架子上有一整盒
I've got a box in the pantry

692
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:54,760
我们会把你名字标上去 麦斯 法宾
We'll put your name on it "Max Fabian "

693
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:59,260
它会永远标在那里 只供你一人用
It will stay there always, just for you

694
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:03,770
让天下其他人去赚那些钱吧!
Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck

695
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,940
还是朋友重要
It's friends that count

696
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:10,860
我有的是朋友 麦斯,我爱你 我是说真的
-And I have friends -I love you, Max I really mean it

697
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,190

来餐具室
Come to the pantry

699
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,370
她爱我如父,她很清楚的
She loves me like a father Also, she's loaded

700
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:37,050
在这里,亲爱的麦斯
There you are, Maxie dear

701
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:40,310
只要一杯波本就可忘了凯小姐
One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Casswell

702
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:43,980
恐怕不成的
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out of

703
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,480
-我已保证过 -跟凯小姐吗?是什么呢?
-I made a promise -To Miss Casswell? What?

704
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,230
还不是为了电影“姐妹” 公开招考试演会
For an audition for this part we are replacing

705
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,400
她的名字叫什么，你的姐妹？
What's her name? Your sister?

706
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,820
-一匙 -不,二匙
-One? -No, two, please

707
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,240
她能演的,或许还不差
If she can act, she might not be bad

708
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:00,490
-看来她似乎可烧尽大伙儿
She looks like she might burn down a plantation

709
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,410
-只有我一个人遭殃而已
Right now, I feel like there is one burning in me

710
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,410
-试演会何时开始? -还有一,二个礼拜吧!
-When's the audition? -A couple of weeks

711
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:10,250
-由我来套台词
Tell you what Why don't I read with her?

在你公司给伊芙一份工作
Give Eve Harrington a job in your office

717
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,940
你的反应还真快
-(belches) -You get quick action, don't you?

718
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:35,940
我想都不会想 把那女孩从你身边带走
I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you

719
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,530
你不是说我存货不够了
You said yourself my inventory was in shape,

720
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,780
我的商品也都发出去了
all my merchandise put away

721
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,450
留她在这也没事好做 只好把她送走
To keep her here with nothing to do, I'd be standing in her way

722
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,460
何况你需要她呀!麦斯 -她要做什么呢?
-And you need her, Max -What will she do?

723
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,380
她可帮上大忙的 阅读剧本
She'd be a great help She'd read scripts,

724
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:54,960
接见必要客人 推掉不必要的客人
interview people you have to see, get rid of those you don't have to

725
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:57,630
麦斯,那你会很清闲的
You'd be a man of leisure, Maxie

726
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,140
为自己多想想吧!
-Well -Think of your health

727
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,720
有更多时间在餐厅休息 呼吸新鲜的空气
More time to relax in the fresh air at a racetrack

728
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:07,390
-我不认为这意见很好 -答应我吧!
-I don't think it's such a good idea -Promise?

729
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,600
-我答应 -这才是好麦斯
-Promise -That's my Max

730
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:13,060
原来你们俩在这里
Oh, there you both are

731
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:15,400
麦斯,凯伦说要走了
Max, Karen's decided it's time to go

732
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,070
她现在人呢?-在你上面的房间
-Where is she now? -Up in your room

733
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:21,490
-失陪了!我去找凯小姐
If you'll excuse me, I'll go and tell Miss Casswell

734

-还有谁在呢? -很多
-Who's left out there? -Too many

735
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,420
对了,还有个客人 是来自好莱坞的影星
And, besides, you got a new guest, A movie star from Hollywood

736
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:36,250
夏克斯! 我把我的签名册送到各地
Shucks! And I sent my autograph book to the cleaners

737
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:43,090
-看得出你不太喜欢我这样
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?

738
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:47,850
-也不尽然 -有时我希望多了解你一点
Not exactly Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better

-When you do, let me in on it -I will

740

-那新来的怎样? -那部戏吗?我想还好吧!
-How's the new one coming? -The play? Oh, all right, I guess

741
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:01,200
蔻拉!又是个二十岁 女孩的故事
Cora Still a girl of 20?

742
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,360
二十岁并不重要
20-ish It's not important

743
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:06,280
难道你不觉得这是它 变得重要的时候吗?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?

744
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:09,540
-这话怎讲? -别装了
-How do you mean? -Don't be evasive

745
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:12,040
玛歌,你还不老嘛!
Margo, you haven't got any age

746
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:15,790
嘉琳小姐已上年纪了 说得跟记者一样好听
Miss Channing is ageless Spoken like a press agent

747
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,710
以我的身份来说 我晓得我在说什么
I know what I'm talking about They're my plays

748
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,880
语气就像作家一样
Spoken like an author

749
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,140
罗维,我不是二,三十岁
Lloyd, I'm not 20-ish I'm not 30-ish

750
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,060
四三个月前,我已经四十岁了
Three months ago I was 40 years old

751
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,730
四十岁!40!
40! Four-0

752
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,270
面对现实吧!
That slipped out

753
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,400
我已经下定决心去承认
I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it

754
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:44,070
我突然觉得脱掉衣服 不晓得会是什么样子?
Now I suddenly feel as if I've taken all my clothes off

755
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,080
一周又一周,观众数以千计 你要多年轻就有多年轻
To thousands of people you're as young as you want

756
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,910
是他们要我那样年轻
As young as they want, you mean

757
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,840
我对数千观众认为我 六十或六百岁没兴趣
I'm not interested whether thousands of people think I'm six or 600

758
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,420
你只在乎一个人是吧!
Just one person, isn't that so?

759
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,680
你该知道那只是个故事 对吧!
You know what this is all about

760
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,260
跟你扮不扮演蔻拉没关系
It has little to do with whether you should play Cora

761
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,430
事实上你和比尔又吵架了
It has everything to do with you having a fight with Bill

762
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,600
比尔三十二岁 他看起来就像三十二岁
Bill's 32 He looks 32

763
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:18,190
他五年前是这模样 二十年后也会是这个模样
He looked it five years ago He'll look it 20 years from now

764
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:20,400
我讨厌男人
I hate men

765
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:25,860
罗维,别担心 你的戏我还是会演
Don't worry, Lloyd I'll play your play

766
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:30,120
如果你喜欢,我可戴上头套 甚至摇呼拉圈也行
I'll wear rompers and come in rolling a hoop, if you like

767
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,920
这时候会有谁来呢? 大家都该回家了呀!
Who'd show up at this hour? It's time people went home

768
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:42,300
把那大衣拿起来
Hold that coat up

769
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,640
谁的呢? 一个好莱坞来的电影影星
-Whose is it? -Some Hollywood movie star

770
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,060
她的飞机误点了 真叫人泄气,对吗?
-Her plane got in late -Discouraging, isn't it?

771
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:55,560
女人穿上这皮草就不冷了
Women with furs like that where it never even gets cold

772
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,730
好莱坞嘛!
Hollywood

773
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:03,820
伊芙告诉我,你过的如何? 快乐吗?
Tell me, Eve How are things going with you? Happy?

774
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,150
这是一个快乐的世界
There should be a new word for happiness

775
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,990
和嘉琳小姐在一起 我真说不上来
Being here with Miss Channing has been a, I just can't say

776
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,490
她太好了,帮我做很多事
She's been so wonderful, done so much for me

777
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,620
罗维说,玛歌决定以
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on stage

778
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:20,670
真实年龄来演出
by overplaying reality

779
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:25,670
下次舞会,貂皮大衣看起来 像是件旧大衣而已
Next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bed jacket

780
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:31,180
伊芙,你尽力了 你和玛歌配合的很好 -晚安!
You've done your share, Eve You've worked wonders with Margo Good night

781
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,100
-瑞奇太太 -叫凯伦就好
-Mrs Richards? -Karen

782
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,180
-凯伦
Karen

783
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:39,850
我正打算求你帮忙
Isn’t it awful? I'm about to ask you for another favor,

784
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,940
其实你已经帮了我
after all you've done already

785
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,940
其实也没人帮你忙
Nobody's done so much

786
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,700
你不该再这么想 认为自己多么需要帮忙
Stop thinking of yourself as one of the hundred neediest cases

787
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:51,950
什么事呢? 嘉琳小姐事业正如日中天
-What is it? -Miss Channing's affairs are in good shape,

788
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:55,120
我现在也不怎么忙了
so there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be

789
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,540
我并不想抢走她什么东西
Not that I'd consider anything that would take me away from her

790
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:02,210
但是前几天 我听法宾先生告诉嘉琳小姐
But the other day when Mr Fabian told Miss Channing

791
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:06,880
法宾的新戏有个角色 他们打算要用别人代替
that her understudy was going to have a baby and they'd have to replace her

792
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:11,720
你想代替玛歌的角色 我是不敢这么想
-You wanna be Margo's new understudy? -I don't let myself think about it even

793
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,390
但那角色我相当的熟 还有各种台步
But I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging,

794
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:18,390
他们不必再找别的女孩
there'd be no need to break in a new girl

795
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,230
只是那天晚上观众只要看
Suppose I had to go on one night

796
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:25,570
嘉琳小姐的戏
to an audience that came to see Margo Channing

797
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:29,240
-那是不可能的了 -这点我就不太担心了
-Oh, no, I couldn't possibly! -I wouldn't worry too much about that

798
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:34,910
玛歌的表演是不会失误的 只要她能走,能爬,能滚 她就能演出
Margo just doesn't miss performances If she can walk, crawl or roll, she plays

799
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,500
戏还会继续演下去 不,玛歌还会继续演下去
-The show must go on -No, dear Margo must go on

800
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,750
事实上我不明白 你为何不可上她的新戏?
I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be her understudy

801
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,420
-你认为嘉琳小姐会同意吗? -我认为她会很高兴
-You think Miss Channing would approve? -I think she'd cheer

802
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:50,880
但瑞奇和辛普森先生呢? 他们会听命行事
-But Mr Richards and Mr Sampson? -They'll do as they're told

803
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,010
-你会替我向法宾先生说吗?
Then would you speak to Mr Fabian about it?

804
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,890
-当然 -你不会忘记
-Of course -You won't forget?

805
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,270
-我不会忘记的
I won't forget

806
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,440
看来我得永远感谢你这朋友
I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I?

807
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:17,370
这些看来就像一堆死畜牲
-The bed looks like a dead animal act -(Karen chuckles)

808
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:20,960
哪一件是貂皮呢? -她不是才刚到吗?
-Which one is sable? -But she just got here

809
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,630
-不到半分钟就找到伴走了
Well, she's on her way with half the men in the joint

810
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:28,300
我才不需要皮草呢! 你不想要一件貂皮大衣吗?
-It's only a fur coat -What do you expect? Live sable?

811
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:32,430
钻石,打牌,黄金,睡觉 任你挑啊!
Diamond collar, gold sleeves You know, picture people

812
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:37,390
其实舞台上的老牌演员 或电影圈人士
(Addison) Elder statesmen of the theatre or cinema

813
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:41,980
呈现给大众的 是他们所扮的角色
assure the public that actors and actresses are just plain folks,

814
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,650
却忽略了他们吸引大众 与现实人生是完全不同的
ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public

815
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:49,400
女人可以为其牺牲
is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings

816
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:52,900
或许更胜一层呢?
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for

817
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:55,490
-目标是什么? -为貂皮
-And probably has -Sable

818
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:59,080
-你是说貂皮?还是狐皮? -其中一个
-Sable? Did she say sable or Gable? -Either one

819
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,330
我们彼此都有这共通点
We all have abnormality in common

820
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:06,250
圈内人的个性都是大同小异
We're a breed apart from the rest of humanity, we theatre folk

821
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,590
我们是人性的原始写照
We are the original displaced personalities

822
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:13,510
我们明晚不必看他专栏了 各位刚刚已经听到了
You won't have to read his column tomorrow, Eve You just heard it

823
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,930
我不同意你的看法,艾德生 或许你没有这种习性
-I don't agree, Addison -That's your particular abnormality

824
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,770
我承认圈内有些害群之马
I admit there's a screwball element in the theatre

825
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:24,940
外表风风光光 台上受万人注目
It sticks out, it's got spotlights on it and a brass band

826
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:30,190
但这是基本的,可以忍受的 没有他们电影根本不能生存
But it isn't basic It isn't standard If it were, the theatre couldn't survive

827
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,240
服务生
Oh, waiter

828
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,700
亲爱的,那不是服务生 是佣人
That isn't a waiter, my dear That's a butler

829
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:37,200
我不想叫他佣人行吗?
Well, I can't yell out "butler", can I?

830
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,870
或许有人名叫佣人
Maybe somebody's name is Butler

831
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:43,540
你很有观点,虽然笨了点 但终究是个论点
You have a point An idiotic one, but a point

832
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:47,630
我不想惹麻烦,只想喝杯酒
I don't wanna make trouble All I want is a drink

833
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:51,500
让我来吧!我替你倒一杯 谢谢你,法宾先生
-Leave it to me I'll get you one -Thank you, Mr Fabian

834
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:57,010
做得好! 看得出你事业会像旭日东升
Well done I can see your career rising in the east like the sun

835
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:03,560
你刚才说 -我说影剧圈十之八九 都是苦差事
You were saying? -The theatre is nine-tenths hard work

836
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:08,400
需要辛劳工作,并配合 血汗,机运和专业素养
Work done the hard way, by sweat, application and craftsmanship

837
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:12,230
这点我同意 影剧圈要成为杰出男女演员
To be a good actor or actress, or anything in the theatre,

838
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,150
是世上最困难的事
means wanting to be that more than anything else

839
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,490
是的,的确是那样
Yes Yes, it does

840
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:21,330
没有哪个行业需要如此 专心,渴望,野心及牺牲
It means a concentration of desire or ambition and sacrifice

841
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:23,740
所以我认为能接受它的人
such as no other profession demands

842
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:27,670
可说不同凡响
And the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary,

843
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,920
一般人是无法忍受的
can't be just someone

844
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,000
付出这么多,收获却这么少
To give so much for almost always so little

845
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:35,340
这么少?
"So little?"

846
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,590
这么少? 你是说收获这么少?
"So little," did you say?

847
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,260
没有任何东西比得上喝采
Why, if there's nothing else, there's applause

848
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:45,600
我在后台听到观众的喝采声
I've listened backstage to people applaud

849
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,600
就像
It's like

850
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:52,610
爱的浪潮 从席上涌来,围绕着你
Like waves of love coming over the footlights and wrapping you up

851
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:58,110
想想看每个表演之夜 数以百计不同的人热爱着你
Imagine, to know every night that different hundreds of people love you

852
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,370
他们微笑,发出异彩眼光 你取悦了他们
They smile, their eyes shine, you've pleased them

853
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:05,620
他们需要你,你属于他们
They want you You belong

854
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,120
所以没什么好计较
Just that alone is worth anything

855
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:28,640
不必起来 不必装得我像皇太后似的
Don't get up And please stop acting as if I were the Queen Mother

856
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:31,650
抱歉 在蜜蜂世界中,玛歌
-I'm sorry, I didn't -Outside of a beehive, Margo,

857
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:34,900
你很难不被认为是只女王蜂
your behavior is hardly queenly or motherly

858
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,070
兄弟,你也在我的蜂巢中 你不晓得吗?
You're in a beehive, pal

859
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:41,820
我们都是忙碌的小蜜蜂 日以继夜地在造蜜
We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night

860
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:43,990
-不是吗,宝贝? -玛歌!你真是的
-Aren't we, honey? -Margo, really

861
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,990
凯伦,别装成女州长模样
Please don't play governess, Karen

862
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,580
我受够你那高尚的品味
I haven't your unyielding good taste

863
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:55,340
我希望我也能去打网球 可是爸爸却不准
I wish I could have gone to Radcliffe, too, but Father wouldn't hear of it

864
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:58,170
我想他是个老顽固 现在该说是老古板
He needed help behind a notions counter

865
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:02,340
或是我应该说老头
I'm being rude now, aren't I? Or should I say, ain't I?

866
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:06,430
你实在是可怜 我看你是太紧张了
You're maudlin and full of self-pity You're magnificent

867
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,930
今晚就这样结束吧!
How about calling it a night?

868
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:11,600
你摆出一副编剧的样子
And you pose as a playwright

869
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:16,360
此场此景,你能想到的 却是大家都去睡吧!
A situation pregnant with possibilities, and all you can think of is "go to sleep "

870
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:19,780
-这是个好构想啊! -这样演不下去了
-It's a good thought -It won't play

871
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:24,780
以一个圈外人来说 我有个绝妙点子,对不起
As a nonprofessional, I think it's an excellent idea Excuse me

872
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:28,620
虽然不太浪漫,但很实际
Undramatic, perhaps, but practical

873
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:31,540
-快乐的家庭主妇 -打住!
-Happy little housewife -Cut it out

874
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:36,540
这是我家,不是剧院 在我家是客人,不是个导演
This is my house, not a theatre In my house you're a guest, not a director

875
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:40,460
别摆出一副大明星的架子 别把你客人都当成配角
Then stop being a star and treating your guests as your supporting cast

876
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:43,220
别火上加油了 该是死的时候了
-Let's not get into a big hassle -It's time we did

877
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:47,470
让玛歌了解 台上能吸引人,下了台就未必
Margo has to realize what's attractive on stage need not be attractive off

878
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,060
好了!
All right!

879
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,310
我要去睡了
I'm going to bed

880
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:04,070
由你当主人,这是你派对 生日快乐,欢迎回家
You be host It's your party Happy birthday Welcome home

881
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,740
-我们的问题待会再解决
And we who are about to die salute you

882
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:08,910
-需要帮忙吗?
Need any help?

883
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:18,380
要抱我上床吗? 脱掉我衣服,扶着我头
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head?

884
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:22,840
钻进被窝,关灯和我甜言蜜语
Tuck me in, turn out the lights and tiptoe out?

885
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:26,930
你想要吗?伊芙
Eve would, wouldn't you, Eve?

886
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:29,680
-如果你愿意 -我才不愿意
-If you'd like -I wouldn't like

887
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,770
-我忘了还拿着 -我记得
-Oh, I forgot I had it -I didn't

888
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,620
太可惜,我们错过第三幕
Too bad We're gonna miss the third act

889
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,200
我也将错过演出了
They're gonna play it offstage

890
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:58,710
-麦斯,要一起来吗? -等一下
-Coming, Max? -In a minute

891
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:06,130
伊芙,你千万别跟我一样 介意玛歌的态度
Eve, you mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do

892
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:09,640
不,一定有某种理由 是我做错了什么
There must be some reason, something I've done without knowing

893
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:13,640
原因在玛歌自己,别去想了 只有爱因斯坦才知道
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out Einstein couldn't

894
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,230
我觉得我该为她 向大家解释一下
But if I thought I'd offended her, of all people

895
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:19,810
伊芙,我也喜欢玛歌
Eve I'm fond of Margo, too

896
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,020
但我了解玛歌 经常
But I know Margo And every now and then,

897
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:27,240
我最想做的一件事 就是一脚踢在她屁股上
there is nothing I wanna do so much as kick her right square in the pants

898
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,910
她总是找人出气
Well, if she has to pick on someone,

899
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:32,490
我想大概就是我吧!
I'd just as soon it was me

900
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,750
-麦斯要送我们回去 -晚安!
-Max is gonna drop us -Good night

901
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:40,000
-晚安
-Good night -Good night

902
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:44,920
瑞奇太太 你不会忘记吧! 我们不久前谈好的事
Mrs Richards? You won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?

903
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:47,090
伊芙,我不会忘记的
No, Eve I won't forget

904
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:15,540
为何自己一个人呢?艾德生
Why so remote, Addison?

905
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:19,210
我想你这制片也该给她打气
You should be at the side of your protégée, lending her moral support

906
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:23,380
我现在不需要给她打气
Miss Casswell is where I can lend no support, moral or otherwise

907
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,710
小姐,在休息室吧?
In the ladies' shall we say "lounge"?

908
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,130
她肚子痛
Being violently ill to her tummy

909
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:30,630
这是试演前的好兆头 在开演前她会没事的
It's good luck before an audition

910
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,890
凯小姐的好运来得太迟了 试演会结束了
Miss Casswell got lucky too late The audition is over

911
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:37,730
怎么可能呢? 我是来跟凯小姐对台词的 我答应过麦斯
It can't be I came here to read with Miss Casswell I promised Max

912
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:40,310
试演通告是两点半 现在都四点了
The audition was at 2 30 It's now nearly four

913
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,150
真的?我得开始学戴手表了 你知道我从不戴表的吗?
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch I never have, you know

914
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:46,570
那么凯小姐的台词谁来对呢?
Who read with Miss Casswell?

915
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:49,240
-比尔? -不是 -罗维? -不是
-Bill? Lloyd? -No

916
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:53,160
-更不可能是麦斯,会是谁呢? -当然是由替代的人来
-Well, it can't have been Max Who? -Naturally, your understudy

917
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,830
我认为由那位怀孕的代角 来饰演是很不自然的
It's unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy

918
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:01,830
我听说你有一位新的代角 她没怀孕,她是伊芙.哈林顿
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy, Miss Eve Harrington

919
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,590
-伊芙?我的替代角色?
Eve? My understudy?

920
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:08,420
-难道你不晓得? 我当然知道
-Didn't you know? -Of course I knew

921
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,590
只不过突然忘了
It just slipped your mind?

922
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:17,010
那凯丝维小姐呢?
How was Miss Casswell?

923
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,850
坦白说,我不记得了
Frankly, I don't remember

924
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,520
-只是突然忘了? -全忘了
-Just slipped your mind? -Completely

925
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,940
我确信目前也无人能告诉你 凯小姐的演技如何?
Nor can anyone else present tell you how Miss Casswell read,

926
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:29,030
或是凯小姐会不会演出?
or whether Miss Casswell read or rode a pogo stick

927
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:31,360
她真的这么差吗?
Was she that bad?

928
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:36,030
玛歌,就如你所知 我这一生都活在戏剧中
Margo, I have lived in the theatre as a Trappist monk lives in his faith

929
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,870
如同修道之人一样 我没有别的世界及生活
I have no other world, no other life

930
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:42,040
我曾历经一些伟大的改革时期
Once in a great while, I experience that moment of revelation

931
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:45,210
那些都使我的祈祷成为真实 你是其中一位
for which all true believers wait and pray You were one

932
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:51,130
金妮是另一位 还有鲍儿 维丝礼,海丝 还有其它三,四位大明星
Jeanne Eagels another, Paula Wessely, Hayes There are others, three or four

933
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:53,550
伊芙.哈林顿也将会在其中
Eve Harrington will be among them

934
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,720
我相信,她的确很不错
I take it she read well

935
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,220
那不是念对白,是场表演
It wasn't a reading, it was a performance

936
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:01,890
出色而绝妙,并经音乐润饰
Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire

937
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,140
多好啊!
How nice

938
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:07,060
假以时日她会变成第二个你
In time, she'll be what you are

939
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:09,650
需要音乐润饰
A mass of music and fire

940
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,950
我可演出毫无缺点
That's me An old kazoo with some sparklers

941
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:19,990
告诉我,比尔赞成吗?
Tell me, was Bill swept away, too?

942
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,620
还是你们二人得突破改革
Or were you too full of revelation to notice?

943
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,420
比尔,并没有说什么
Bill didn't say

944
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,080
但罗维却专心听她的对话
But Lloyd listened to his play

945
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:29,500
就像听别人的作品一样
as if it had been written by someone else, he said

946
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:32,840
那么新鲜,振奋人心
It sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning

947
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:37,850
那对罗维来说太好了 对伊芙也太好了 对大家都好呀!
How nice for Lloyd How nice for Eve How nice for everybody

948
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:42,600
伊芙却非常谦虚 她坚持自己不算什么
Eve was incredibly modest She insisted that no credit was due her

949
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:46,940
罗维认为她的表演完全 合乎他笔下描写的角色
That Lloyd felt as he did because she read his lines exactly as he'd written them

950
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:50,270
你是说我演得不好?
The implication being that I did not read them as written?

951
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:54,860
对话时我没提到你名字 或影射你的表演
Neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation

952
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:03,500
感觉好多了吗?亲爱的
Ah! Feeling better, my dear?

953
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:09,960
我好像刚上过英国电台 现在又怎么了?
Like I just swam the English Channel Now what?

954
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:14,210
你下个目标是打进电视圈
Your next move, it seems to me, should be towards television

955
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,560
告诉我电视也有试演会吗?
Tell me this Do they have auditions for television?

956
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:25,640
电视呀!除了试演还是试演
That's all television is, my dear Nothing but auditions

957
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,520
玛歌达令!
Oh, Margo, darling

958
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:47,830
抱歉!来迟了,午餐拖太久 找不到计程车
Terribly sorry I was late Lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab

959
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,250
凯小姐呢?我们可开始了吗? -你好!伊芙 -嘉琳小姐,你好
-Where's Miss Casswell? Oh, hello, Eve -Hello, Miss Channing

960
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:54,000
你怎么找到法宾先生办公室?
How are you making out in Mr Fabian's office?

961
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:57,050
麦斯,你别太折磨这孩子
Now, Max, I don't want you working this child too hard

962
01:06:57,130 --> 01:06:58,680
你答应过我
just because you promised

963
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,850
就如同我也信守我的承诺
As you see, I kept my promise, too

964
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:04,260
一切都结束了
It's all over

965
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:07,430
-什么结束了? -试演会
-What's all over? -The audition

966
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:12,190
伊芙表演给凯小姐看了 伊芙?太妙了!
-Eve read with Miss Casswell -Eve? How enchanting

967
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:15,690
你们两个怎么想到这点子 让伊芙来对凯丝维的台词
How did you get the idea of letting Eve read with Miss Casswell?

968
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:20,030
她是你的临时替角呀! 伊芙?我的临时替角? 我怎么不知道
-Well, she's your understudy -Eve? My understudy? I had no idea

969
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,370
我以为你知道 她一礼拜前就开始做了
I thought you knew She started a week ago

970
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:24,700
这实在难以想象 我从没见过她到后台
I've never seen her backstage,

971
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:28,710
当然这工作是很多人想要的
but with so many people loitering about Well, well

972
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:31,460
伊芙根本不是替麦斯工作
So Eve is not working for Max, after all

973
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:35,130
麦斯,你这大滑头
Max, you sly puss

974
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:42,220
嘉琳小姐 我心中有说不出的高兴 -但你这么晚才到
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late

975
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,010
-真的?为什么呢?
Really, Eve? Why?

976
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,470
如果你一开始就在这里 我绝不敢对台词的
Otherwise, I never would have dared to read

977
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,140
有何不可呢? 如果你是半夜来
-Why not? -If you'd come in the middle,

978
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:51,310
无疑地 我绝不敢这么做的
I couldn't have gone on

979
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,400
太可惜了! 所有灯火及音乐都被关掉了
What a pity All that fire and music being turned off

980
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,990
-什么灯火和音乐? -你绝不会明白的
-What fire and music? -You wouldn't understand

981
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,150
凯丝维小姐表现如何呢?
How was Miss Casswell?

982
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,410
回库克班纳戏剧学校去了
Back to the Copacabana

983
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:05,160
但是伊芙,玛歌 我来跟你谈谈伊芙
But Eve, Margo Let me tell you about Eve

984
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:06,990
嘉琳小姐,我吓死了 相信我
I was dreadful, Miss Channing

985
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:10,830
我无权担任任何人的替角 尤其是你的
I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours

986
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,670
我看你是低估自己了 你一向是如此的!
I'm sure you underestimate yourself You always do

987
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:15,750
你们不是要跟我讲伊芙吗?
You were about to tell me about Eve

988
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,920
-你真该为她骄傲 -这我确定
-You'd have been proud of her -I'm sure

989
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:20,670
-她是个天才 -你们两个也是
-She was a revelation -Oh, to you too?

990
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:24,090
-这话是什么意思? -我是说其它的事
-What do you mean by that? -It must have been a revelation

991
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:28,100
那么这铁定是24岁的角色 由24岁的演员来演
to have a 24-year-old character played by a 24-year-old actress

992
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:30,600
-你把话题扯远了 -这绝对正中话题
-That's beside the point -It is the point

993
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:33,020
这个演出一定很新鲜
It must have seemed so new and fresh to you,

994
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:36,440
你一定很兴奋吧! 那些台词就如同出自你手笔
so exciting, to have your lines read just as you wrote them

995
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,780
艾德生! 那表演是多么有意义 火花以及音乐旋律
-Addison -So full of meaning, fire and music

996
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:44,030
你的口气就像是艾德生夫人
You've talked to that venomous fishwife DeWitt

997
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,950
这次看来我信任的人 都已经刊在世界年鉴上了
In this case, as trustworthy as the world almanac

998
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,120
你知道你进来,试演会已结束 伊芙只是你的代角
You knew when you came in that Eve was your understudy

999
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:52,710
代替你游戏,用嘴对词而已
Playing that childish game of cat and mouse

1000
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:56,040
不是嘴,是些鼠辈行径
Not mouse Never mouse If anything, rat

1001
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:58,880
以你的天份,如此误解
Your genius for making a bar-room brawl

1002
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,960
一个完全无辜的女孩
out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding

1003
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:03,800
完全无辜? 我看我去上吊好了
Perfectly innocent? Men have been hanged for less

1004
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,300
我对她说了谎吗? 她背后攻击我
I'm lied to, attacked behind my back,

1005
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:09,560
归罪于你的烂对话 或是你的上帝
accused of reading your play as if it were the holy gospel

1006
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,480
我从未这么说过
I never said it was

1007
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:15,900
你何时听到有人读你的剧本? 你理想人选是谁?
You listen as if someone else had written your play Whom do you have in mind?

1008
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:19,230
亚瑟 米勒?谢武德 波玛和费雪吗?
Arthur Miller? Sherwood? Beaumont and Fletcher?

1009
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,860
-我能说句话吗? -不行!
-May I say a word? -No!

1010
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:26,990
你认为亚瑟 米勒和谢武德 会像我这样忍受你胡来?
You think Miller or Sherwood would stand for the nonsense I take from you?

1011
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:31,370
你最好跟波玛和费雪一起 他们已死了三百年了
Stick to Beaumont and Fletcher They've been dead for 300 years!

1012
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:35,250
所有剧作家早该在 三百年前就死了
All playwrights should be dead for 300 years!

1013
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:40,670
那根本不能解决问题 因为女演员是不朽的
That would solve none of their problems because actresses never die!

1014
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,390
明星是不朽且不变的
The stars never die and never change

1015
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,180
你可随时变更明星
You may change this star any time you want

1016
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:55,520
成为夸张而刺激的新星 充满火爆音乐,
for a new and fresh and exciting one, fully equipped with fire and music

1017
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,770
随心所欲 由夜间秀开头好了
Any time you want, starting with tonight's performance

1018
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:01,940
这些让律师来解决吧!
This is for lawyers to talk about

1019
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:05,780
这关系到所有的戏剧 你不能胡来
This concerns a contract that you cannot rewrite or ad-lib

1020
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:10,280
法宾先生,你威胁对我 采取法律行动吗?
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr Fabian?

1021
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:14,870
-你要破坏合约吗? -回答我的问题
-Are you breaking the contract? -Answer my question

1022
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:19,040
我一点办法也没有 就像死人一样 -我没听到
-Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man -I don't hear you

1023
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:23,050
-我说我是个垂死的人 -除非这世界上
-I said I'm a dying man! -Not until the last drugstore

1024
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:25,880
没卖药的药房
has sold its last pill

1025
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:29,720
我真不明白是如何演变的
I shall never understand the process by which a body with a voice

1026
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,220
而使得身躯和声音 突然幻想它自己是心智
suddenly fancies itself as a mind

1027
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:34,810
是何时开始由女演员决定
Just when does an actress decide

1028
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:38,480
她所说的话及所表达的思想
they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?

1029
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:42,230
通常从她重写并重新思考开始
Usually at the point when she has to rewrite and rethink them

1030
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,990
为了避免观众远离戏院
to keep the audience from leaving the theatre

1031
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:49,950
该让钢琴手了解协奏曲 但并非他所写的
It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!

1032
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:01,790
你!我认为是帕特瑞斯基 他使我在钢琴上弹出协奏曲
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?

1033
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:06,170
-音乐里的点火公主呢?
Where is Princess Fire and Music?

1034
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:08,760
-谁? -那个孩子
-Who? -The kid Junior

1035
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:17,350
新来的走了 -我一定把她吓走了
-Gone -I must have frightened her away

1036
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,350
我一点也不意外 有时你令我吃惊
I wouldn't be surprised Sometimes you frighten me

1037
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:23,860
可怜的小东西 抓紧裤子,弃甲而逃
Poor little flower Dropped her petals and folded her tent

1038
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:27,280
-别胡闹啦! -我就是要闹
-Don't mix your metaphors -I'll mix what I like!

1039
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,530
什么都不是,只有躯体和声音 没有思想
I'm nothing but a body with a voice No mind

1040
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:33,120
多美的躯体!多美的声音
What a body What a voice

1041
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:37,870
那个耶修新闻记者 没有躯体声音,充满思想
That ex ship-news reporter No body, no voice, all mind

1042
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,920
雨停了,战争结束了! 冷静吧!
The gong rang, the fight's over, calm down

1043
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,540
-我才不要冷静
I will not calm down

1044
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:45,170
-那就不要冷静
Don't calm down

1045
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,220
-你真是宽宏大量 -我尽了全力
-You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you? -I'm trying terribly hard

1046
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:56,810
-不必如此 -我不要别人宽容我 我也不要别人来挑剔我
Well, you needn't be I will not be tolerated and I will not be plotted against

1047
01:11:56,890 --> 01:12:00,140
又来了 真是无聊,你当我是什么?
-Here we go -Such nonsense What do you take me for?

1048
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:02,100
乡下的土女人?
Little Nell from the country?

1049
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:04,820
没通知我一声 就偷偷的代了一星期
Been my understudy for a week without me knowing it

1050
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,990
一定是偷偷摸摸的 别冲动
-Carefully hidden, no doubt -Don't get carried away

1051
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:11,570
这里的试演会 大家都知道我要来
Arrives here for an audition when everyone knows I will be here,

1052
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:16,490
不管到哪里都由我演出 你已跟罗维说好了,不是吗?
-and gives a performance out of nowhere -You've been all through that with Lloyd

1053
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:20,750
剧作家是不过问演出 但他却如此,这次可不行
The playwright doesn't make the performance It doesn't just happen

1054
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:23,750
火爆的音乐有何不可?
Full of fire and music and whatnot

1055
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,250
一定是谨慎地排演过
Carefully rehearsed, I have no doubt

1056
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:29,090
竟是些比尔和辛普森要的人
Full of those Bill Sampson touches

1057
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:32,680
-你这种胡闹妄想症真烦人 -妄想症?
-I am tired of these paranoiac outbursts -Paranoiac?

1058
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,850
今天下午2点半我才知道 伊芙.哈林顿是你的候补演员
I didn't know Eve was your understudy until this afternoon

1059
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:37,850
告诉福特大夫要我休长假吧!
Tell that to Dr Freud along with the rest of it

1060
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:41,770
不!我要告诉你 我最后一次告诉你
No, I'll tell it to you for the last time

1061
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:46,360
你必须停止以这种妄想症 来伤害我们彼此
Cos you've got to stop hurting the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums

1062
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,570
又是我吗? 我连它是什么都不知道
That word I don't even know what it means

1063
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:50,110
我总算找到适当时机了
It's time you found out

1064
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:52,780
我爱你 我爱你
-I love you I love you -Hah!

1065
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,950
你美丽且有才华 一个没有声音的驱体
-You're beautiful and intelligent -A body with a voice

1066
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:59,790
一个美丽又有才华的女人 也是伟大的女演员
A beautiful and an intelligent woman, and a great actress

1067
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:05,040
伟大女演员事业前途无量 你绝对有权得到幸福
A great actress at the peak of her career You have every reason for happiness

1068
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:07,040
-幸福除外 -绝对有权的
-Except happiness -Every reason

1069
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:11,800
但却做出这些奇怪失控 孩子气的行为
But due to some uncontrollable drive, you permit the slightest action of a kid

1070
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,800
什么孩子? 孩子气,甚至使你变得 经常歇斯底里尖叫
-A kid! -a kid to turn you into a screaming harpy

1071
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:18,260
以后别再这样了
Now, once and for all, stop it

1072
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,660
显然你不是女人
It's obvious you're not a woman

1073
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:43,660
这点我还知道 -但我是
-I've been aware of that for some time -Well, I am

1074
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:45,830
-又怎么说
I'll say

1075
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:48,420
不要这么低俗了
Don't be condescending

1076
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:51,000
快起来!我请你喝一杯
Come on, get up I'll buy you a drink

1077
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:53,050
我承认我是比以前如意
I may have seen better days,

1078
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:56,340
但还没有喝鸡尾酒的身价
but I'm still not to be had for the price of a cocktail

1079
01:13:56,430 --> 01:13:58,510
像个咸花生
Like a salted peanut

1080
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:04,350
玛歌,我们谈和吧! 条件很高,要无条件投降
-Margo, let's make peace -The terms are too high

1081
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,860
只是开心一下 停止这些为伊芙的无聊争执
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve?

1082
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:11,610
连我也不行吗? 一点也不无聊
-And Eve and me? -It's not nonsense

1083
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:15,990
若我告诉你刚才是我做的 你会听吗?
But if I tell you it is, as I just did, were you listening to me?

1084
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:21,370
-这还不够吗? -但愿是
-Isn’t that enough? -I wish it were

1085
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:24,040
那么该怎样才够?
Then what would be enough?

1086
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,460
我们结婚好吗?
If we got married?

1087
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:29,790
我不要你为了 证明某件事而娶我
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something

1088
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:33,630
你有这么多理由拒绝我
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me

1089
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:38,220
玛歌告诉我,到底什么问题?
Margo, tell me what's behind all this

1090
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,300
我我不知道,比尔
I don't know, Bill

1091
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:42,810
只是一种感觉,我不知道
It's just a feeling I don't know

1092
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:44,890
我想你很清楚
I think you do know

1093
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,690
但你不愿或不能告诉我
But you won't or can't tell me

1094
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:53,650
我以前说过这是最后尝试 这是真的
I said before it was gonna be my last try, and I meant it

1095
01:14:53,730 --> 01:14:57,320
我完全没办法,但愿我能做到
I can't think of anything else to do I wish I could

1096
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:01,910
我们总在落幕时尖叫丢东西
We usually wind up screaming as the curtain comes down

1097
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,660
等幕再升起时再和好
Then it comes up again and everything's fine

1098
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,870
但这次不会了
But not this time

1099
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,670
你知道这是世间的一部戏
No playwright in the world could make me believe

1100
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:15,090
能让我相信在两个成人间 会发生这种事
this would happen between two adult people

1101
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:18,550
再见!玛歌
Goodbye, Margo

1102
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,890
比尔!
Bill?

1103
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:31,020
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

1104
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:33,400
去找伊芙吗?
To find Eve?

1105
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:38,610
这句话使一切变得更可信了
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable

1106
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:00,180
罗维

1107
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:02,970
去找伊芙吗?
Lloyd

1108
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:07,810
罗维,怎么了? -火死了!满肚子火
-Lloyd, what's happened? -Up to here, that's where I've got it

1109
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:10,640
-那明星胆大妄为,歇斯底里的
Of all the star-ridden, presumptuous, hysterical

1110
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:12,650
-又是玛歌? 一而再再而三迟到
-Margo again -And again and again

1111
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:15,900
使试演会晚两小时才开始 玛歌是会这样的
-Two hours late for the audition -That's on time for Margo

1112
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:19,900
依惯例迟到又孩子气 不知道自己是候补演员
And then a childish routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy

1113
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:22,320
-她不知道呀 -她当然知道
-It's possible she didn't -She knew

1114
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:26,490
艾德生告诉她 伊芙如何优异诠释那个角色
Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part

1115
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:30,830
凯伦!我跟你说伊芙 她具有所有条件
Karen, let me tell you about Eve She's got everything A born actress

1116
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,250
是天生演员敏锐,善解人意 年轻,活跃,精力充沛
Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting

1117
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:35,500
-一点缺点都没有吗?
You'll run out of adjectives, dear

1118
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:39,010
-具备一切编剧想写的优点
Everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about,

1119
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:42,090
直到这部剧成为嘉琳独角戏
until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing

1120
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:44,180
玛歌演得不好吗?
Margo hasn't done badly by it

1121
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:47,100
玛歌很棒,她知道 麻烦在这里
Margo's great She knows it, that's the trouble

1122
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:50,430
她演得可好了 还要指派谁来配戏
She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants and who's to stop her?

1123
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,690
谁能让她随心所欲呢?
Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?

1124
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:58,940
这会是个很冷的周末
It's gonna be a cozy weekend

1125
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:02,110
你说什么呀! 明晚我们开车去乡下
-What is? -We're driving to the country tomorrow

1126
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,530
就我们四个人 比尔,玛歌,你跟我
Just the four of us Bill, Margo, you and I

1127
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:09,450
我们以前也度过这种周末 但也不怎么样
Well, we've spent weekends before with nobody talking

1128
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:14,170
要确定锁上那会致伤的器具 和会摔烂的东西
Just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects

1129
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,880
他们说牛顿发现地心引力
(Karen) Newton, they say,

1130
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,300
因看到苹果打在人的头上
thought of gravity by getting hit on the head by an apple

1131
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:24,970
发明蒸气机的人
And the man who invented the steam-engine,

1132
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:26,890
是看到茶壶
he was watching a teakettle

1133
01:17:26,970 --> 01:17:31,640
但不是我 我坐在沙发想到好点子
But not me My big idea came to me just sitting on a couch

1134
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:36,650
那个情绪不稳的玛歌 根本不知道有事了
That boot in the rear to Margo Heaven knows, she had one coming

1135
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:41,070
因我,罗维,伊芙,比尔 麦斯等人之故
From me, from Lloyd, from Eve, Bill, Max and so on

1136
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:44,570
我们常为这件事感到伤神
We'd all felt those size fives of hers often enough

1137
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:48,240
但怎么办?答案在我心中翻滚
But how? The answer was buzzing around me like a fly

1138
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,240
灵机一现
I had it

1139
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:55,580
但我又放弃了 尖声呼叫名字是一回事
But I let it go Screaming and calling names is one thing,

1140
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:57,750
但这意谓着
but this could mean

1141
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:03,920
有何不可呢? 为什么? 我对我自己说,玛歌
Why not? "Why," I said to myself, "not?"

1142
01:18:04,010 --> 01:18:06,340
那好像很合理
It would all seem perfectly legitimate

1143
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:09,180
而全世界只有两个人会知道
And only two people in the world would know

1144
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:13,350
而且对每个人都有好处
Also, the boot would land where it would do the most good for all concerned

1145
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:16,350
毕竟那只是无伤大雅的玩笑
After all, it was no more than a harmless joke

1146
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:19,520
玛歌自己将是最开心的
which Margo herself would be the first to enjoy

1147
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:23,780
根本没有理由不告诉她 所以我就
And no reason why she shouldn't be told about it, in time

1148
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:36,290
麻烦你接伊芙.哈林顿听电话
Hello Will you please call Miss Eve Harrington to the phone?

1149
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:39,790
没关系,我等
Not at all I'll wait

1150
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:45,550
那对屋外的人是个寒冷周未
(Karen) It was a cold weekend, outside and in

1151
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:47,470
没见到比尔人影
Bill didn't come at all

1152
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:52,390
玛歌不知道她的处境 她根本不在乎,话说个不停
Margo didn't know where he was and didn't care, she kept saying

1153
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:54,970
过了礼拜天
Somehow we staggered through Sunday,

1154
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:58,900
周一下午 我们送玛歌到车站时
and by the time we drove Margo to the station late Monday afternoon,

1155
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:04,070
她和罗维考虑要彼此以礼相待
she and Lloyd had thawed out to the extent of being civil to each other

1156
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:05,610
现在几点了?
What time is it?

1157
01:19:05,690 --> 01:19:08,320
一分钟前是5点42分
When you asked a minute ago, it was 5 42

1158
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:11,570
现在是5点43分 -一分钟后你再问就是
It is now 5 43 When you ask again a minute from now

1159
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:16,080
-我只是不要玛歌误了火车 -几点会到戏院?
I just don't want Margo to miss her train As it is, she'll barely make the theatre

1160
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,920
-5点55分,我们到车站时间还很足够
5 55 We'll be at the station in plenty of time

1161
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,750
那小地方距纽约只要两小时
That little place "just two hours from New York "

1162
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,760
我这呆头脑很难了解
It's on my list of things I'll never understand,

1163
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,180
住在那落伍的印第安社区
like collecting shrunken Indian heads

1164
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,680
一般人你该了解的 想要一点点安静及和平
You should know what it means to want a little peace and quiet

1165
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:35,520
安静和平是属于图书馆的
Peace and quiet is for libraries

1166
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,770
-罗维,拜托!
Lloyd Please

1167
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:41,600
-只是滑了一下 这些路像玻璃
Just a little skid, that's all This road's like glass

1168
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:45,860
-凯伦和我不希望出意外 -我并不想造成意外啊!
-Karen and I just don't want an accident -I don't intend to have an accident

1169
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:50,200
那对你会比较危险 我们都穿了长内衣
It isn't important whether you do We are wearing long underwear

1170
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:54,490
这是怎么回事?
Now what's this?

1171
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,390
不可能,不可能没汽油的
But it can't be We can't be out of gas

1172
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:17,140
我昨天亲自加的油 -你今早开到伯斯特家 不是满的吗?
I filled it myself yesterday Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?

1173
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:20,730
我没看 你知道我从不注意那些的
I didn't look You know I don't pay attention to those things

1174
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:22,400
-简直难以置信
Just incredible

1175
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,570
-我们还有多少时间? -大约十分钟
-How much time have we got? -Roughly ten minutes

1176
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:28,650
-车站有多远? 大约3,4哩路
-How far is the station? -About three or four miles

1177
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:33,070
附近有房子或农庄吗? 我们可借点汽油 这种荒僻的路上
-Any houses where we can borrow gas? -There's not much along this back road

1178
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:36,410
不会有多大机会可搭到便车
Not many cars either Not much chance of a lift

1179
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:40,710
没关系,你们坐在这里等 我向前走,说不定会有机会
No sense in sitting here I'm gonna walk up about half a mile, just in case

1180
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,430
-你要听吗? -没关系
-You want it on? -It doesn't matter

1181
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:04,270
我的格调不高
I detest cheap sentiment

1182
01:21:10,610 --> 01:21:13,110
凯伦!
-Karen? -Mm-hm?

1183
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,360
不要,谢谢
No, thank you

1184
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:19,120
这周末我心情很坏 最近我们都有点紧张
-I haven't been very pleasant this weekend -We've all been a little tense lately

1185
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:22,160
想想我几星期来都很快乐
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks

1186
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:24,290
对那件事我实在抱歉
For that, I'm truly sorry

1187
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:28,290
你们和我最知心 我不要你和罗维生我的气
More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me

1188
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:32,380
我们不是真的生气 只是不高兴你的作法
We're never deeply angry We just get mad the way you do

1189
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:34,550
我们知道你做得很好
We know you too well

1190
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,220
有那么多人认识我
So many people know me

1191
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:40,470
我真希望有人说说我的事
I wish I did I wish someone would tell me about me

1192
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:43,480
-你是玛歌,就是玛歌
You're Margo Just Margo

1193
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:48,980
-那是什么意思? 生命里的灿烂时刻
And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean

1194
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:54,860
那也只是暂时的 那大部份只是我的青春
Besides a temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick

1195
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:57,240
和我的尖叫声
and screaming at the top of my voice

1196
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,830
我的行为很幼稚
Infants behave the way I do, you know

1197
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:04,330
我不断的犯错 只有在酒醉时才清醒
They carry on and misbehave They'd get drunk if they knew how,

1198
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,250
但还是不能如我所愿
when they can't have what they want

1199
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:10,590
当感到不被需要或不安全感
When they feel unwanted or insecure or

1200
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,340
或不被爱时
unloved

1201
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:18,340
-比尔呢? -比尔怎么了?
-What about Bill? -What about Bill?

1202
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:20,100
他爱你
He's in love with you

1203
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:25,020
我爱比尔超过世上所有东西 我要比尔…
More than anything in this world, I love Bill And I want Bill

1204
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:27,190
我要他要我
And I want him to want me

1205
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:29,360
但只是我,不是玛歌.嘉琳
But me, not Margo Channing

1206
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:33,320
我都无法分辨清楚 他又怎么能?
And if I can't tell them apart, how can he?

1207
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:36,530
为什么要分他和你呢?
Well, why should he and why should you?

1208
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,620
比尔爱上玛歌.嘉琳
Bill's in love with Margo Channing

1209
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:41,530
他被迫和她工作而爱上她
He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her

1210
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:45,960
但十年后玛歌.嘉琳将会消失
But ten years from now Margo Channing will have ceased to exist

1211
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:49,670
而剩下的将是什么?
And what's left will be What?

1212
01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:54,050
-玛歌,比尔只小你八岁
Margo, Bill is all of eight years younger than you

1213
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:59,140
-我见多了那种勉强的婚姻
Those years stretch as the years go on I've seen it happen too often

1214
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:01,470
-不会是你和比尔
Not to you, not to Bill

1215
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,390
-他们不总是那么说吗?
Isn’t that what they always say?

1216
01:23:09,230 --> 01:23:12,070
他用走的,而汽车却不会动
I don't suppose the heater runs if the motor doesn't

1217
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:13,360
很傻是吗?
Silly, isn't it?

1218
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:17,740
他以为我们留在车内较暖和
You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm

1219
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:20,910
说到伊芙
About Eve

1220
01:23:20,990 --> 01:23:24,370
我的态度很不给她面子
I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her too

1221
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:28,250
别为我找借口
-Well -Don't fumble for excuses

1222
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:31,080
别在我放下头发的时候
Not here and now with my hair down

1223
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:35,920
最好就说我太敏感了
At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to

1224
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:40,930
事实上她那么年轻 柔弱而无助
Well, to the fact that she's so young, so feminine and so helpless

1225
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:44,260
我想给比尔太多的东西
To so many things I want to be for Bill

1226
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:47,140
女人的事业真是滑稽
It's funny, a woman's career

1227
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:51,850
你为了爬得更快 而抛弃在楼梯上的东西
The things you drop on your way up so you can move faster

1228
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:55,860
忘了当你又变回女人 会再需要它们
You forget you'll need them again when you get back to being a woman

1229
01:23:55,940 --> 01:24:00,860
不论喜不喜欢 每个女人的事业都会结束
That's one career all females have in common, whether we like it or not

1230
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:03,030
成为一个女人
Being a woman

1231
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,740
早晚我们都要做的
Sooner or later, we've got to work at it

1232
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:10,120
不论我们有多渴望其它事业
No matter how many other careers we've had or wanted

1233
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:15,290
但最后还是没什么好处 只能为人准备三餐
And in the last analysis, nothing's any good unless you can

1234
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:17,960
铺床整被
look up just before dinner or

1235
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:20,720
就是那样
turn around in bed and there he is

1236
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,050
不那样就不是女人
Without that, you're not a woman

1237
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:28,640
你会办公或收集书报
You're something with a French provincial office or a A book full of clippings

1238
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:32,480
你不算是女人
But you're not a woman

1239
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:38,480
布幕会慢慢放下
Slow curtain The end

1240
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:45,830
玛歌!玛歌!我对这件事非常抱歉
Margo Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this

1241
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:48,750
-对什么事? -这件事
-About what? -This

1242
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:51,500
我说不出我心中的歉意
I can't tell you how sorry I am

1243
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:54,580
别多想了,有些事命中注定
Don't give it a thought One of destiny's merry pranks

1244
01:24:54,670 --> 01:24:59,340
毕竟不是你把汽油弄光的
After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline tank yourself

1245
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:08,510
伊芙确实精彩无比
(Addison) Eve, of course, was superb

1246
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:09,770
许多观众宁可再次
Many of the audience

1247
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:13,690
来看玛歌演出
understandably preferred to return another time to see Margo

1248
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:18,270
但那些长久留下的热烈喝采 是为伊芙
But those who remained cheered loudly, lustily and long for Eve

1249
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:22,030
那个下午她非常周到 打电话邀我去
How thoughtful of her to call and invite me that afternoon

1250
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:25,530
多么愉快的巧合
And what a happy coincidence that several representatives

1251
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,120
刚好有几家报社代表也在场
of other newspapers happened to be present

1252
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,450
那天下午我们都被邀请观赏
All of us invited that afternoon

1253
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:33,290
一场候补的演出
to attend an understudy's performance,

1254
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:35,210
对此管理人事先一概不知
about which the management knew nothing

1255
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:38,880
直到9点才开幕
until they were forced to ring up the curtain at nine o'clock

1256
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,380
很巧地
Coincidence

1257
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,800
你不仅可以而且演出生动 你出色极了
(Bill) You were better than all right

1258
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:46,470
还有一些毛病,不过没关系
You rang a bell Little things here and there, but it doesn't matter

1259
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:49,140
你有权为自己感到骄傲
Be proud of yourself You've got a right to be

1260
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:51,310
你为我感到骄傲吗?比尔
Are you proud of me, Bill?

1261
01:25:51,390 --> 01:25:54,390
-我承认我担心,有些怀疑
I admit I was worried when Max called I had my doubts

1262
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:58,980
-你不该怀疑的 毕竟前天只是一个场景而已
-You shouldn't have had any doubts -After all, the other day was one scene

1263
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:01,650
这个剧每一场景都令人激赏
The woods are full of one-scene sensations

1264
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:05,570
你做到了 你努力和耐心,会成为好演员
But you did it With work and patience, you'll be a good actress

1265
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:08,990
那是你的期望 -不也是你对我的期望吗?
-if that's what you wanna be -Is that what you want me to be?

1266
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:13,160
-我在谈你和你的期望 我也是
-I'm talking about you and what you want -So am I

1267
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:18,420
-我跟这个有何关系? -都有关系
-What have I got to do with it? -Everything

1268
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,720
虽然我自找的,但与我无关 祝你幸运
The names I've been called, but never Svengali Good luck

1269
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:31,180
比尔,别逃!
Don't run away, Bill

1270
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:33,770
我要逃避什么?
From what would I be running?

1271
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:39,440
-你在舞台上总是追求真实 那下了舞台呢?
You're always after truth on the stage What about off?

1272
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:43,570
-我同样追求 那就面对它
-I'm for it -Then face it I have

1273
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:47,110
我一直都是,自从第一晚在这间更衣室
Ever since that first night in here

1274
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,280
当我告诉你 年轻女演员所该知道的?
I told you what every actress should know

1275
01:26:49,410 --> 01:26:53,370
当你告诉我不论我成为什么 都是因为你
You told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you

1276
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:56,460
-化妆还是浓了点 -是为了你
-Make-up's a little heavy -And for you

1277
01:26:57,460 --> 01:27:00,460
-你很不简单 -你这么想吗?
-You're quite a girl -You think?

1278
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:05,550
-我爱上玛歌,你没听说吗? -我全听说了
-I'm in love with Margo Hadn't you heard? -You hear all kinds of things

1279
01:27:05,630 --> 01:27:09,550
我只是个凡人,为合约才投入 而好奇的是另外一个人
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary, and I'm as curious as the next man

1280
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:12,560
-试试看吧! -只是…
-Find out -Only thing:

1281
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,890
我追求的是我想要追求的
what I go after I want to go after

1282
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:17,060
我不要别人跟着我
I don't want it to come after me

1283
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:27,820
别哭! 你有你值得骄傲的地方
Don't cry Just score it as an incomplete forward pass

1284
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:52,010
是谁?
Who is it?

1285
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,810
我可以进来吗?
May I come in?

1286
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:58,940
当然可以,杜维特先生
Certainly, Mr DeWitt

1287
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:06,110
我如愿见到剧院聚集大群 为你疯狂的观众
I expected to find this room with a theatreful of people at your feet

1288
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:10,700
我很幸运他们没有丢东西 -你的表演我一点也不意外
-I'm lucky they didn't throw things -Your performance was no surprise to me

1289
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:14,200
经过上次,我认为诺言 必然会实现
After the other day, I regarded it as simply a promise fulfilled

1290
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:18,370
你太仁慈了 但依然是嘉琳小姐主演
You're more than kind But it's still Miss Channing's performance

1291
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:21,710
我只是她的影子而已 你却没看到真正的她
I'm the carbon copy you read when you can't find the original

1292
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:27,050
你太谦虚了 -不是谦虚 我只是想跟自己开个玩笑
-You're more than modest -It's not modesty I don't try to kid myself

1293
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:29,550
若你愿意听我建议有一种
A revolutionary approach to the theatre

1294
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:34,050
革命性打进戏剧界的方法 -请说
-But if I may make a suggestion -Please do

1295
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:37,220
我认为该是你享有人情味时
I think the time has come to shed some of your humility

1296
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:41,520
适当的表现是绝对有必要的
It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly

1297
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:44,650
我目的并不在表现自己
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about

1298
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:48,820
我们来到世上绝不是想 默默无闻
We come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns

1299
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:50,990
若我们不自我表现 还有谁会呢?
If we don't blow them, who else will?

1300
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:57,490
即使如此 一次漂亮的替代演出 明天就会被遗忘的
Even so One pretty good performance by an understudy, it'll be forgotten tomorrow

1301
01:28:58,830 --> 01:29:01,660
不一定要那样
It needn't be

1302
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:07,420
即使我像你说的,不要谦卑 自夸一下,
Even if I wanted to, as you say, be less humble, blow my own horn,

1303
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:11,590
我要怎么做呢? 我是个默默无闻的人
how would I do it? I'm less than nobody

1304
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:16,180
-我来头就不小 -你当然是
-I'm somebody -You certainly are

1305
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:21,230
让门开着,我们可以谈话
Leave the door open a bit, so we can talk

1306
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:30,440
你先换衣服 如果没什么其它的事 我们一起吃顿晚餐
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we could have supper

1307
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:33,900
我很乐意,干嘛假装很忙呢?
I'd love to Or should I pretend I'm busy?

1308
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:38,450
让我们彼此坦诚相对 我想为你作一栏报导
Let's have a minimum of pretending I shall want to do a column about you

1309
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:40,870
-我的事连一段都写不满
I'm not even enough for a paragraph

1310
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:42,870
-或许不只一栏
Perhaps more than one

1311
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,790
我很想听听有关你的事 我零星听过你一些事
There's so much I want to know I've heard your story in part

1312
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,210
你家在威斯康辛 有个悲惨的婚姻
Your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage,

1313
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,710
你对玛歌的狂热依恋
your fanatical attachment to Margo

1314
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:53,880
那是从旧金山开始的,是吗?
It started in San Francisco, didn't it?

1315
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:59,220
我说你崇拜玛歌是从 旧金山开始的,是吗?
I say your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?

1316
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:00,470
没错!
That's right

1317
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:04,480
旧金山,加州的文化之都
San Francisco, an oasis of civilization in the California desert

1318
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:08,900
你同意我对旧金山的观点吗?
Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?

1319
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:11,070
是的,我同意
Yes, I do

1320
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:16,070
玛歌首次在台上吸引你 注意的夜晚
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage,

1321
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:20,330
那是旧金山哪家剧院? 是舒伯特剧院吗?
what theatre was it in San Francisco? Was it the Shubert?

1322
01:30:20,410 --> 01:30:22,500
是的,舒伯特剧院
Yes, the Shubert

1323
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:26,750
舒伯特,最后的剧场 充满了传统
Fine old theatre, the Shubert Full of tradition

1324
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:30,630
未遭受地震侵袭 该说是火灾
Untouched by the earthquake Or should I say fire?

1325
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:33,510
告诉我你先生叫什么名字?
Tell me, what was your husband's name?

1326
01:30:34,510 --> 01:30:36,590
-艾迪 -艾迪什么?
-Eddie -Eddie what?

1327
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:44,350
我要去淋浴了 我会听不见你说的话
I'm about to go into the shower I won't be able to hear you

1328
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:46,270
我可以等
Well, it can wait

1329
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:49,610
-你想去哪里?今晚蛮特别的
Where would you like to go? We must make this a special night

1330
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:52,940
-由你安排
You take charge

1331
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:54,940
我会的
I believe I will

1332
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:13,050
几家早报专栏刊载伊芙演出
(Karen) Some morning papers carried a squib about Eve's performance

1333
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:15,550
内容不多,但全是赞美
Not much, but full of praise

1334
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:18,220
我无法想象他们怎么知道的
I couldn't imagine how they found out about it

1335
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:22,470
但罗维说麦斯负责宣传 可能把消息散出去
But Lloyd said Max's publicity man probably sent out the story

1336
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,890
不论如何我深深的感到 罪恶和愧疚
At any rate, I felt terribly guilty and ashamed of myself

1337
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:29,400
我只想忘掉这一切
and wanted nothing so much as to forget the whole thing

1338
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:31,810
玛歌和我在21号午餐
Margo and I were having lunch at 21,

1339
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:34,530
就像朋友般,那天阳光普照
just like girlfriends, with hats on

1340
01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:38,900
-嘉琳小姐来了吗? -还没,瑞奇太太
-Has Miss Channing come in? -Not yet

1341
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:41,070
-谢谢
Thank you

1342
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:46,500
伊芙,听说你演出非常成功
Oh, Eve! I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance

1343
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:48,960
-大概是事先大伙套好的吧!
Relief that I managed to stagger through it

1344
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,080
-她太出色了
She was magnificent

1345
01:31:50,170 --> 01:31:52,420
-你也听到了-我在那里,我亲眼见到
-Then you've heard, too -I was there

1346
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:55,500
-你昨晚去看演出了? －纯粹是巧合
-You were at the play last night? -A happy coincidence

1347
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:59,840
-我们和一个天才电影观察家吃午餐 -真会利用时间
-We're having lunch with a talent scout -They certainly don't waste much time

1348
01:31:59,930 --> 01:32:03,680
没什么,我们只吃午餐
-It's nothing definite Just lunch -They'll be wasting their time

1349
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,850
如果他们料到伊芙根本 不想去好莱坞
Eve has no intention of going to Hollywood

1350
01:32:06,930 --> 01:32:10,190
从你的穿着看来 我猜和你进餐的是位小姐
By your smart dress, I take it your companion is a lady?

1351
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:12,520
玛歌! －玛歌到公共场合午餐?
-Margo -Margo lunching in public?

1352
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:15,440
是个新的玛歌 只不过她如往常一样迟到
It's a new Margo, but she's just as late as the old one

1353
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:18,070
或许她为新的原因迟到吧!
She may be later than you think

1354
01:32:21,530 --> 01:32:24,280
不妨读我的专栏消磨时间
Why not read my column to pass the time?

1355
01:32:24,410 --> 01:32:27,200
-时间会过得快些 -谢谢!艾德生
-The minutes will fly like hours -Thank you, Addison

1356
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:29,960
我们必须去参加音乐演奏会了
Now we must join our sunburned eager beaver

1357
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:32,120
-再见,凯伦 -再见
-Goodbye, Karen -Goodbye

1358
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:57,730
多年以来我看过这么多演出 真叫我听烦了
"And so my hat which has, lo, these many seasons,

1359
01:32:57,820 --> 01:33:01,650
直到哈林顿小姐出现
"become firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington

1360
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:05,740
我又再度在街上舞蹈 在屋顶上欢呼
"I am available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops "

1361
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:09,580
这真是太虚伪了吧! 看这里,看这里,听着
I thought that one went out with Woollcott Now listen to this

1362
01:33:09,660 --> 01:33:14,000
哈林顿小姐优点太多 足以出一部书
"Miss Harrington had much to tell and these columns shall report her faithfully

1363
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:18,000
本栏将忠实为其报导 她在戏剧上出色的表现
"about the lamentable practice in our theatre of permitting

1364
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:21,010
或容我以成熟的诠释技巧 来继续扮演此角色
"mature actresses to continue playing roles

1365
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:25,510
需要这年轻且充满活力 来使演出永留观众记忆里
"requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory "

1366
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:28,760
-我真不相信 -还有更精彩的
-I just can't believe it -It gets better

1367
01:33:28,850 --> 01:33:33,350
我们了解舞台应面临换血
"About the understandable reluctance of our entrenched first ladies of the stage

1368
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:36,270
该鼓励像哈林顿一样的年轻演员
"to encourage, shall we say, younger actresses,

1369
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:39,940
长期争取演出机会
"and Miss Harrington's unsupported struggle for opportunity "

1370
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:43,110
我真不敢相信他说那种话 －这个鼠辈说每个人犯了
-I can't believe Eve said those things -In this rat race,

1371
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,950
阻碍文化进步的罪
everybody's guilty till proved innocent

1372
01:33:46,030 --> 01:33:50,700
剧院和文化有何差距?
One of the differences between the theatre and civilization

1373
01:33:50,790 --> 01:33:52,000
令我奇怪的是
What gets me

1374
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:55,790
为何城里报纸 全都注意到那种特别的演出?
is how all the papers happened to catch that particular performance

1375
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,960
罗维说是宣传部发出的
Lloyd says it's a publicity release

1376
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:00,800
那小女巫一定派出印第安武士
The witch must have sent out Indian Runners,

1377
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:06,140
到酒吧,蒸气房和博物馆 她所能取得支持的地方
snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up

1378
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:07,510
我绝不会轻易放过她
She won't get away with it

1379
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,970
艾德生绝不会称心如意
Nor will Addison DeWitt and his poison pen

1380
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:13,730
如果我的律师不采取行动
If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it,

1381
01:34:13,810 --> 01:34:18,770
我会亲自把那下流的 杜维特先生勒死
I shall personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr DeWitt's ugly throat!

1382
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:34,410
我阅读完那篇东西 就马上赶来了
I came as soon as I read that piece of filth I ran all the way

1383
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,180
比尔在这里,宝贝!
Bill's here, baby

1384
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:50,350
一切都会没事的
Everything's all right now

1385
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:02,110
我想此刻就是法国人说的 祸从天降
I guess at this point I'm what the French call "de trop "

1386
01:35:02,190 --> 01:35:04,900
或许没那么严重
Maybe just a little around the edges

1387
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:21,540
艾德生从头到尾导演这一幕
It's Addison from start to finish It drips with his brand of venom

1388
01:35:21,630 --> 01:35:24,300
利用那小女孩,扭曲她的话
Taking advantage of a kid, twisting her words,

1389
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:27,130
让她说他想写的话
making her say what he wanted her to say

1390
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:30,720
-你哪里得来这消息的? -伊芙!
-Where did you get all that information? -Eve

1391
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:33,810
-伊芙? -她来看过我
-Eve? -She's been to see me

1392
01:35:33,930 --> 01:35:37,230
事实上你进来时,她刚走 你刚好错过了
She left just before you came in You just missed her

1393
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:40,810
太可惜了 －想解释访问的事
-That was a pity -Wanted to explain about the interview

1394
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:44,650
想找某人道歉 她不敢面对玛歌
Wanted to apologize to someone, and didn't dare face Margo

1395
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:48,650
她为何不敢呢? 她一开口就无法控制
-I wonder why -She started talking and couldn't finish

1396
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:50,820
哭得好伤心
She cried so

1397
01:35:52,410 --> 01:35:56,500
我查过我们的财务状况 若你让我说明
I've been going over our financial position, if you'll pardon the expression

1398
01:35:56,620 --> 01:36:01,080
你的话题转得太快! 就要缴税金了
-That's quite a change of subject -What with taxes coming up, and,

1399
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:05,090
因为我是个编剧 不是个精算师,我一直在想
since I'm a playwright and not an oil-well operator, I was thinking

1400
01:36:05,170 --> 01:36:07,420
我努力在听你说
I'm trying hard to follow you

1401
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:11,260
伊芙要等到下一季,才能上台 表演
Instead of waiting until next season to do Footsteps on the Ceiling,

1402
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:13,180
那是很好的安排
which is in pretty good shape,

1403
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:17,180
如果可说服玛歌跟 艾吉和伍德作巡回演出
and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with Aged in Wood,

1404
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:20,440
我们可马上开始制作
we could put Footsteps into production right away

1405
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:24,270
我开始有点明白了 －若能恰当处理就行得通
-I'm beginning to catch up -If we can cast it properly, that is

1406
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:26,980
或许找个年轻的演那角色
Maybe get some younger actress?

1407
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:29,190
某个适合演那个角色的人
Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?

1408
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:33,950
你得承认这是个新奇构想 －是你想出的或是伊芙提的
-You've got to admit, it'd be a novelty -Now you're quoting Addison or Eve

1409
01:36:34,030 --> 01:36:36,450
伊芙没提到戏,只是提一下
Eve did mention the play, but in passing

1410
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:39,540
她从没要求角色 她没那种勇气
She'd never have the nerve to ask to play a part like Cora

1411
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:42,710
伊芙甚至会要求 让她演加丝黛萝
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello

1412
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:46,130
不!那是我自己的意思 当她跟我谈到剧的时候
I got the idea myself while she was talking about the play

1413
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:49,050
当然只是暗示了
-With gestures, of course -To write something

1414
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:53,890
这次我写的是完全可靠的角色 而且我总算不必妥协了
and have it realized completely For once, not to compromise

1415
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:56,430
罗维 瑞奇你不会是想把那角色
Lloyd Richards, do not consider

1416
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:59,140
给那卑鄙的小坏虫
giving that contemptible little worm the part of Cora!

1417
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:04,230
等等! 这些年来玛歌.嘉琳并没有一直要你迁就她
-Now just a minute -Margo's not been exactly a compromise

1418
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:07,980
就算能完成美好的作品 妥协又算什么呢?
Playwrights everywhere would give their shirts for that compromise

1419
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:09,230
你给我等一下
Now just a minute

1420
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:12,740
真叫人震惊,伊芙既不忠实 又卑鄙,这是会传染的
Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious

1421
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:16,490
你这种莫名的歇斯底里
All this hysteria because of an impulsive excited kid

1422
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:19,500
就为一个纯真的孩子被专业 主观的剧评家杜维特唆使
and a professional manure-slinger named DeWitt

1423
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:23,420
她道歉了,不是吗? 我相信她还下跪,很感人
-She apologized, didn't she? -On her knees, I've no doubt

1424
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:26,670
也非常戏剧化的艺术
Very touching Very Academy of Dramatic Arts

1425
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:30,760
你那付刻薄相 就因为我不符合你的要求
That bitter cynicism is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe

1426
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:35,640
我今天的刻薄是因为我发现 我和一个小男孩有很大距离
That cynicism I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys

1427
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,260
哈啰!
Hello

1428
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:41,770
嘿!玛歌!
Oh, hi, Margo

1429
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:44,440
不!不一点也不!
No, not at all

1430
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:48,690
凯伦和我正在聊天
Karen and I were just chatting

1431
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:55,240
当然可以,而且我们很乐意
Yes, I'm sure we can and I'm sure we'd love to

1432
01:37:55,780 --> 01:37:58,450
对,11点45分
Right 11 45ish

1433
01:38:00,370 --> 01:38:02,450
好,到时见
See you then

1434
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:08,960
玛歌和比尔要我们收工后 到饭店的酒吧跟他们喝酒
Margo and Bill want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight after the theatre

1435
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:11,630
玛歌.嘉琳会在酒吧间
Margo Channing in the Cub Room

1436
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:15,220
我真意外,她心情好转了
I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's tomb

1437
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:19,470
很高兴比尔回心转意了 他们失去对方会活不下去
-I'm glad Bill's back -They'd die without each other

1438
01:38:20,470 --> 01:38:23,980
达令!我没给伊芙任何承诺 我只觉得她很适合那角色
I didn't promise Eve anything I said she'd be fine for the part

1439
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:26,400
但仍有些困难
but there were practical difficulties

1440
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,560
例如什么? 你是其中原因之一
-Such as? -You, for one

1441
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:32,820
我告诉你安排玛歌演那角色 没有你许可,我不会换人
I told her you wanted Margo to play the part and I would want your approval

1442
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:35,070
那就好!太好了!
That's fine Fine and dandy

1443
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:39,320
往后伊芙.哈林顿小姐 有任何要求都来找我
Just refer all of Miss Eve Harrington's future requests to me

1444
01:38:43,330 --> 01:38:47,920
所谓演技并非那么遥不可及
The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard

1445
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,460
听!听! －不过你们可以引述下面的话
-Hear, hear -But you may quote me as follows

1446
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:56,090
今晚玛歌.嘉琳小姐 演出的精彩好戏
"Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play,

1447
01:38:56,180 --> 01:39:02,350
演技是我前所未见 我期望能再次大饱眼福
"the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again "

1448
01:39:02,430 --> 01:39:06,020
-他并非吹嘘我很不错 -你太出色了
-He does not exaggerate I was good -You were great

1449
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:11,360
真是美好的夜晚 你该给你候补演员 哈林顿小姐一个通告
Quite a night I hear your understudy, a Miss Harrington, has given her notice

1450
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:13,610
-太糟了 -我为此难过
-Too bad -I'm broken up about it

1451
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:16,530
为某些理由让你无法举杯庆祝
You just can't pick up champagne and drink it

1452
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:19,110
该有人聪明地来个干杯
Somebody's got to be very witty about a toast

1453
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,280
我请你干杯,
I shall propose the toast,

1454
01:39:21,370 --> 01:39:24,540
不是说笑 是诚心诚意
without wit, with all my heart

1455
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:27,290
-玛歌
To Margo

1456
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:30,500
-为我未来的新娘干杯 -荣耀的哈利路亚
-To my bride-to-be -Glory hallelujah

1457
01:39:30,710 --> 01:39:32,790
-玛歌 -喝吧!
-Margo -Drink

1458
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:39,800
什么时候?你们何时结婚? -明天十点我们在市政府见
-When? When are you going to do it? -Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten

1459
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:42,640
你一定要准时 -当然
-And you're going to be on time -Yes, sir

1460
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,970
市政府!那上报不太光彩
City Hall, that's for prizefighters and reporters

1461
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:48,060
我看到大教堂吧! 有主教加上整排的鲜花
I see a cathedral, banks of flowers

1462
01:39:48,190 --> 01:39:52,060
这只是为了结婚证书 还要三天等验血及一些手续
It's only for the license There's a three-day wait for blood tests

1463
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:55,360
若你根本没有血 我也会嫁你
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all

1464
01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:58,570
你打算穿什么? 简单点就行了
-What are you going to wear? -Something simple,

1465
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:00,660
晚礼服外加貂皮大衣
a fur coat over a nightgown

1466
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:05,740
在卡希路包尔公园的教堂
The point is this In a cathedral, a ballpark or a penny arcade,

1467
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:09,750
我们请两位观礼 -你们是我们最亲密的朋友
we want you two beside us, as our nearest and dearest friends

1468
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:13,170
-我们是,我们永远都是
Which we are Which we'll always be

1469
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:18,010
人生少有这么美好的时刻 值得永记在心
There are very few moments in life as good as this Let's remember it

1470
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:22,010
敬每一位和我们全体 我们从没这么亲近过
To each of us and all of us, never have we been more close

1471
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:24,600
愿我们永远如此
May we never be farther apart

1472
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:28,930
-瑞奇太太 -什么事?
-Mrs Richards? -Yes

1473
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:31,100
-你的 -谢谢
-For you -Thank you

1474
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:35,360
太不谨慎了,这样就能打开
Very indiscreet A note in the open like that

1475
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:38,690
下次叫你情人要封紧点
Next time, tell your lover to blow smoke rings or tap a glass

1476
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:41,110
罗维,我要你别计较这个
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this

1477
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:44,780
今晚世界充满了爱 每一个女人都很危险
The world is full of love tonight No woman is safe

1478
01:40:44,910 --> 01:40:50,540
这真是创世界的纪录
Well, this beats all world's records for running, jumping or standing gall

1479
01:40:52,210 --> 01:40:55,460
“请原谅,打扰你们愉快聚餐
"Forgive my butting in to what seems such a happy occasion,

1480
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:57,800
但我有要事想和你谈”
"but it's important that I speak with you

1481
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:00,380
“请…”还有下划线
"'Please"' and that's underlined,

1482
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:03,470
“请到女化妆室见面,伊芙”
"meet me in the ladies' room Eve "

1483
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:07,640
我知道她在那里当候补演员
I understand she's now the understudy in there

1484
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:10,480
把那支空瓶给我 我可能会找到他们
Hand me that empty bottle I may find her

1485
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:15,560
看!混蛋在那儿
Well, look There's Rasputin

1486
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:22,820
打开香槟
Encore du champagne

1487
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:26,580
-还要香槟?嘉琳小姐 -我已经说过了,鲍伯
-More champagne, Miss Channing? -That's what I said, bub

1488
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:28,830
也许她只想道歉
Maybe she just wants to apologize

1489
01:41:28,910 --> 01:41:31,750
我对她要说的 一点也不感兴趣
I have no interest in anything she may say

1490
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:35,250
-她能说什么?我很感兴趣
But what could she say? That's what fascinates me

1491
01:41:35,330 --> 01:41:39,670
-去查清楚 凯伦,凭我们多年的友谊
-Go on, find out -Karen, in all the years of our friendship,

1492
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:43,340
我绝不让你独自进化妆室
I have never let you go to the ladies' room alone

1493
01:41:43,470 --> 01:41:46,260
但现在我得让你去
Now I must I am busting to find out

1494
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:50,850
我渴望查出那颗发烧小脑袋 在想些什么
what's going on in that feverish little brain waiting in there

1495
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:55,650
好吧! 好吧!
Well All right

1496
01:42:00,690 --> 01:42:02,690
凯伦,
Karen!

1497
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:04,860
太好了
How nice

1498
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:19,290
很有效,但为什么对着我呢?
Very effective, but why take it out on me?

1499
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:46,570
我还在想你会不会来
I was wondering whether you'd come at all

1500
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:49,570
别站起来,我可不是皇太后
Don't get up And don't act as if I were the Queen Mother

1501
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:51,740
-我没想到你会不高兴
I don't expect you to be pleasant

1502
01:42:51,870 --> 01:42:54,000
-我本来就不高兴
I don't intend to be

1503
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:58,080
我们能坐下来谈一分钟吗? 我有许多不易启齿的话要说
Can't we sit down just for a minute? I've got a lot to say and none of its easy

1504
01:42:58,210 --> 01:43:00,670
-不可能太多的 -事实上是的
-There can't be very much -But there is

1505
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:04,670
-不管容不容易,我都不相信 -你该相信的
-Easy or not, I won't believe a word of it -Why should you?

1506
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:07,680
请坐
Please sit down

1507
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:17,020
我一向自认为很聪明 精明,
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl

1508
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:20,360
我的头脑很灵光
Smart, good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing

1509
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:23,940
绝不会弄错场合说错话
Never the wrong word at the wrong time

1510
01:43:24,030 --> 01:43:26,530
那我就不会遇上艾德生了
But then I'd never met Addison DeWitt

1511
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:31,030
我记得有一次我去试演
I remember I had a tooth pulled once

1512
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:34,370
他们给我几个候补机会 我不记得名字了
They gave me some anaesthetic I don't remember the name

1513
01:43:34,450 --> 01:43:36,290
那对我产生奇怪的影响
It affected me strangely

1514
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:40,130
我发现自己说些没想过的话
I found myself saying things I wasn't even thinking

1515
01:43:40,210 --> 01:43:44,300
好像我的意识跑出我体外 无法控制自己的言语及行为
As if my mind was outside of my body and couldn't control what I did or said

1516
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:47,800
-你就是那样跟艾德生说的? -就是那样
-And you felt like that talking to Addison? -In a way

1517
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:50,510
你努力想说出内心的话
You find yourself trying to say what you mean,

1518
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:52,470
但话却变了,
but somehow the words change

1519
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,640
变成他的话
They become his words

1520
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:58,980
突然间你说的不是你的意思 或他的意思
And suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means

1521
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:01,770
你要我相信你没说那些话
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of that?

1522
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:03,480
而那全是艾德生说的吗?
That they were all Addison?

1523
01:44:03,610 --> 01:44:05,980
我并不期望你相信
I don't expect you to believe anything,

1524
01:44:06,070 --> 01:44:10,160
-只是责任与耻辱都在于我
except that the responsibility is mine, and the disgrace

1525
01:44:11,570 --> 01:44:14,080
-我们别再演戏了
Let's not get overdramatic

1526
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:18,830
你真的很看不起我
You really have a low opinion of me, haven't you?

1527
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:22,000
我给你一些愉快的消息
I'll give you some pleasant news

1528
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:26,420
我在城里到处遭冷眼
I've been told off in no uncertain terms, all over town

1529
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:29,010
嘉琳应该很高兴听到这个
Miss Channing should be happy to hear that

1530
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:32,010
知道她的朋友多么忠实
To know how loyal her friends are,

1531
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:36,350
而我比她想象的更忠实
how much more loyal than she had a right to expect me to be

1532
01:44:36,430 --> 01:44:39,350
-伊芙,不要哭 -我没哭
-Eve, don't cry -I'm not crying

1533
01:44:41,190 --> 01:44:45,270
告诉我 你和好莱坞那个人午餐 结果如何?
Tell me, how did your luncheon turn out with the man from Hollywood?

1534
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:48,110
他答应我做几次试镜
Some vague promises of a test

1535
01:44:48,190 --> 01:44:50,610
会有个特别角色给我
If a particular part should come along, one of those things

1536
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:55,030
-但他们很重视你的演出 -候补的演出
-But the raves about your performance -An understudy's performance

1537
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:59,960
我想你太夸张了
Well, I think you're painting the picture a little blacker than it is, really

1538
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:04,330
若没其它办法,别低估了他 你有个很有势力的朋友
Don't underestimate him You have a powerful friend in Addison

1539
01:45:04,670 --> 01:45:07,210
-他不是我朋友,你才是
He's not my friend You were my friends

1540
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:10,220
-他可以帮你 -但愿我没遇见他
-He can help you -I wish I'd never met him

1541
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:12,380
真希望他死
I'd like him to be dead

1542
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:14,550
我希望我的朋友回来
I want my friends back

1543
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:20,230
伊芙! 我不认为你故意那么做的
Eve I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness

1544
01:45:20,310 --> 01:45:24,560
但是你做了 或许你也不太好过
But you did More to yourself perhaps, as it turned out, than to anyone else

1545
01:45:24,690 --> 01:45:27,820
-我永远无法释怀 -你会的
-I'll never get over it -Oh, yes, you will

1546
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:32,490
新剧院将重新建起 在舞台上没有永远不变的事
You theatre people always do Nothing is forever in the theatre

1547
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:36,910
不论呈现什么 火光闪烁,火焰汹涌
Whatever it is, it's here, it flares up, burns hot,

1548
01:45:36,990 --> 01:45:39,080
它消失了
and it's gone

1549
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:43,420
-但愿我能相信 -给你自己时间吧!
-I wish I could believe that -Give yourself time

1550
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:46,080
别太担心人们的想法
Don't worry too much about what people think

1551
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:48,880
你很年轻,很有才华
You're very young and very talented

1552
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:54,430
信不信由你 我帮不上忙了
And, believe it or not, if there's anything I can do

1553
01:45:54,510 --> 01:45:56,930
有件事你能
There is something

1554
01:45:59,350 --> 01:46:03,940
我知道 一件你能做的最重要的事
-I think I know -Something most important you can do

1555
01:46:04,270 --> 01:46:08,570
你想演蔻拉 你要我告诉罗维 把那角色给你演
You wanna play Cora You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it

1556
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:11,860
假如你这么告诉他 他会把这角色给我
If you told him so, he'd give me the part He said he would

1557
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:16,780
你终于说出来了 你不知道那角色 是为玛歌写的吗?
After all you've said Don't you know that part was written for Margo?

1558
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:19,620
15年前可能是 但现在该是我的角色
It might've been 15 years ago It's my part now

1559
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:25,120
你的口气就像艾德生的文章 蔻拉是我的角色,你一定要 告诉罗维给我那角色
-You talk just as Addison said you did -Cora is my part You've got to tell Lloyd

1560
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:27,790
-没有任何原因能让我那么说
Nothing in the world will make me say that

1561
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:29,630
-艾德生要我演那个角色
Addison wants me to play it

1562
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:32,880
-除非我死了 -我看不需要的
-Over my dead body -That won't be necessary

1563
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:36,890
艾德生知道玛歌 刚好赶不上演出
Addison knows how Margo happened to miss that performance,

1564
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:42,220
我怎会知道她没赶上 而通知城里每家报社
how I happened to know she'd miss it in time to notify every paper in town

1565
01:46:42,310 --> 01:46:45,730
经过非常曲折 艾德生可制造许多故事
It's quite a story Addison could make quite a thing of it

1566
01:46:45,810 --> 01:46:47,940
想象他多么邪恶
Imagine how snide and vicious he could get,

1567
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:50,150
利用那些事虚造声势
and still tell nothing but the truth

1568
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:52,980
我必须先跟你谈
I had a time persuading him

1569
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:57,410
你最好坐下,你脸色很苍白
You better sit down You look a bit wobbly

1570
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:06,500
如果我演蔻拉 艾德生绝不会将真相说出来
If I play Cora, Addison will never tell what happened, in or out of print

1571
01:47:06,620 --> 01:47:09,670
彼此简单的交换好处
A simple exchange of favors

1572
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:13,250
我很高兴终于能帮你忙
I'm so happy I can do something for you at long last

1573
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:17,590
你和玛歌
Your friendship with Margo,

1574
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:20,300
交情深厚
your deep, close friendship

1575
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:22,310
若她知道你所玩的奸计
What would happen to it

1576
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:26,270
会如何呢?
if she knew the cheap trick you played on her for my benefit?

1577
01:47:26,350 --> 01:47:30,150
你和罗维能在影剧圈混多久
You and Lloyd, how long, even in the theatre,

1578
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:35,490
大家才会忘掉你们所做的事 而不再相信你们
before people forgot what happened and trusted you again?

1579
01:47:37,490 --> 01:47:39,200
不能这样
No

1580
01:47:40,370 --> 01:47:44,700
让大家注意蔻拉由谁演出 要轻松多了
It would be so much easier for everyone concerned if I were to play Cora

1581
01:47:44,830 --> 01:47:47,330
对剧院也好多了
So much better theatre, too

1582
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:50,210
剧中的角色
A part in a play

1583
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:54,800
你这么做只为争取这角色
You'd do all that just for a part in a play?

1584
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:57,800
我会尽力争取更多的角色
I'd do much more for a part that good

1585
01:48:21,070 --> 01:48:23,200
饿吗?
Hungry?

1586
01:48:24,990 --> 01:48:28,660
我绝不意外,你的哀兵之计
I'm not surprised, after all that humble pie

1587
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:32,580
没那回事 凯伦和我相谈甚欢
Nothing of the kind Karen and I had a nice talk

1588
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:34,750
女人之间坦诚相见
Heart to heart? Woman to woman?

1589
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:39,510
包括闲聊你希望演蔻拉一角?
Including a casual reference to the part of Cora and your hopes of playing it?

1590
01:48:39,590 --> 01:48:41,760
我很坦白地和她讨论
I discussed it very openly

1591
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:44,430
我告诉她我和罗维讲了 他很感兴趣
I told her I'd spoken to Lloyd, and that he was interested

1592
01:48:44,510 --> 01:48:48,770
凯伦当然说那角色 预备由玛歌演出
And Karen mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?

1593
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:52,690
奇怪!她一直没提玛歌
Oddly enough, she didn't say a word about Margo

1594
01:48:52,770 --> 01:48:57,360
只是她说很乐意促成 我演那个角色
Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play it

1595
01:48:58,610 --> 01:49:01,110
真是那样吗?
Just like that, eh?

1596
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:03,780
就是那样!
Just like that

1597
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:07,740
知道吗?伊芙 有时候我觉得你有事瞒着我
You know, Eve, sometimes I think you keep things from me

1598
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:12,370
-你这句话并不好笑 -本来就不好笑
-I don't think that's funny -It wasn't meant to be

1599
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:16,210
你是我认识的最值得信赖的人
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known

1600
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:19,210
却没头没脑的说那种话
To say a thing like that now, without any reason,

1601
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:21,630
而我现在比以往更需要你
when I need you more than ever

1602
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:24,300
希望你说的是真心话
I hope you mean what you say

1603
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:26,890
我打算好好与你相处
I intend to hold you to it

1604
01:49:28,220 --> 01:49:31,310
看来我们有许多共同点
We have a great deal in common, it seems to me

1605
01:49:41,070 --> 01:49:44,820
怎么了? 没什么,她含着泪说抱歉
-Well, what happened? -Nothing much She apologized

1606
01:49:44,950 --> 01:49:46,910
-含着泪? -是的
-With tears? -With tears

1607
01:49:46,990 --> 01:49:50,910
-但不是马上落泪 首先她一定抬着头 说了一大套道理
But not right away First fight them back, chin up, stout fellow

1608
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,500
-对了! -很有水准,技术也很高明
-Check -Very classy Lots of technique

1609
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:58,420
这么久她就只是向你道歉 那你说了什么?
You mean all this time she's done nothing but apologize? What did you say?

1610
01:49:59,130 --> 01:50:01,170
没说什么
Not much

1611
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:06,590
-新郎,我可要个结婚礼物吗?
Groom, may I have a wedding present?

1612
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:11,100
-你要什么?德州吗? 我要大家别再谈伊芙
-What would you like? Texas? -I want everybody to shut up about Eve

1613
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:14,020
绝口别再提伊芙 我就要这个
Just shut up about Eve That's all I want

1614
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:16,270
再给凯伦倒些酒
Give Karen more wine

1615
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:18,440
我从没这么快乐过
Never have I been so happy

1616
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:21,690
这房间真的很棒 酒吧屋,
Isn't it a lovely room? The Cub Room

1617
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:26,110
真是个好名字 来的都是些主角人物
What a lovely, clever name Where the elite meet

1618
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:30,540
我从没看过这么多大人物 注意着我
Never have I seen so much elite, all with their eyes on me,

1619
01:50:30,660 --> 01:50:35,120
好让我用瓶子打他鼻子
waiting for me to crack that little gnome on the noggin with a bottle

1620
01:50:35,210 --> 01:50:39,630
但不是今晚,今晚我宽恕一切 连伊芙在内,我宽恕伊芙
But not tonight I'm forgiving tonight Even Eve I forgive Eve

1621
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:42,960
他们走了
There they go

1622
01:50:44,130 --> 01:50:45,800
伊芙也走了
There goes Eve

1623
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:49,010
伊芙?魔鬼?她是小恶魔
Eve Evil, little Miss Evil

1624
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:53,220
魔鬼都做什么? 他们都干什么?
But "the evil that men do " How does that go, groom?

1625
01:50:53,350 --> 01:50:55,810
他们会留下好的吗?
Something about the good they leave behind

1626
01:50:55,890 --> 01:50:58,230
我曾演过一次老式的魔鬼
I played it once in rep in Wilkes-Barre

1627
01:50:58,310 --> 01:51:01,070
你在里头也没得到什么好处
You've got it backwards, even for Wilkes-Barre

1628
01:51:01,150 --> 01:51:04,820
知道我为何原谅伊芙吗? 她留下了好东西
Do you know why I forgive Eve? She left good behind

1629
01:51:05,070 --> 01:51:09,490
因此我们四人会在此聚会 是伊芙的错,我原谅她
The four of us here together, it's Eve fault I forgive her

1630
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:14,410
还有比尔,尤其是比尔 也是她促成的
And Bill, especially Bill She did that too

1631
01:51:14,830 --> 01:51:17,170
-或许她一点也没什么恶意
You know, she probably means well after all

1632
01:51:17,250 --> 01:51:20,710
-她是个讨厌鬼 -谁都骗不了玛歌的
-She is a louse -Never try to outguess Margo

1633
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:23,590
-比尔 -什么事?
-Groom? -Yes, dear

1634
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:26,010
-知道我要当什么吗? -牛仔?
-Do you know what I'm going to be? -A cowboy?

1635
01:51:26,090 --> 01:51:29,180
-结婚的女人 需要一纸结婚证书
-A married lady -With a paper to prove it

1636
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:33,100
我会期待着六点的来临 等待丈夫回家
I'm going to look up at six o'clock, and there he'll be

1637
01:51:33,770 --> 01:51:36,560
-记得吧!凯伦 -我记得
-Remember, Karen? -I remember

1638
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:41,440
-你会在那里吧! -我绝不放弃那种特权
-You'll be there, won't you? -Often enough to keep the franchise

1639
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:44,190
绝没有自动退出舞台的
No more make-believe, offstage or on

1640
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:47,030
记得吗?罗维,我需要退休了
Remember, Lloyd? I mean it now

1641
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:50,280
-罗维,你保证不生我的气吗?
Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?

1642
01:51:50,950 --> 01:51:53,740
-那要看情形 -我是指真正的生气
-That depends -No, I mean deeply angry

1643
01:51:53,950 --> 01:51:56,200
-我想我不会的
I don't think I could be

1644
01:51:56,290 --> 01:51:59,290
-我不想演蔻拉
Well, I don't want to play Cora

1645
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:02,880
-什么? 等等,你总是那么容易激动
-What? -You're always so touchy about his plays

1646
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:07,380
那个角色是个很棒的角色 剧本也很好,但不适合我了
It isn't the part It's a great part and a fine play But not for me anymore

1647
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:11,800
不再适合一个想安定下来 过平淡生活的结婚女性
Not for a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright, married lady

1648
01:52:12,050 --> 01:52:14,390
那和结婚有何关系?
What's your being married got to do with it?

1649
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:17,810
那意谓我终于找到自己的生活
It means I've finally got a life to live

1650
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:20,810
不用再演过于年轻的角色
I don't have to play parts I'm too old for

1651
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:24,320
就只为消磨无所事事的夜晚
just because I've got nothing to do with my nights

1652
01:52:25,230 --> 01:52:27,820
罗维,我知道你已弄好计划 相信我会补偿你
Oh, Lloyd, I'll make it up to you, believe me

1653
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:32,820
为这角色忙了一年 我只能请你谅解
I'll tour a year with this one, anything Only you do understand, don't you?

1654
01:52:39,790 --> 01:52:42,250
-什么事那么好笑? -没事
-What's so funny? -Nothing

1655
01:52:42,670 --> 01:52:46,170
-没事? -一切都太好笑了
-Nothing? -Everything Everything's so funny

1656
01:52:58,180 --> 01:53:00,850
罗维从没问过我
(Karen) Lloyd never got around to asking

1657
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:05,020
是否愿意让伊芙演蔻拉一角
whether it was all right with me for Eve to play Cora

1658
01:53:05,110 --> 01:53:10,190
很奇怪首先比尔拒绝导演此剧 因为伊芙参加演出
Bill, oddly enough, refused to direct the play at first, with Eve in it

1659
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:13,030
罗维和麦斯最后说服了他
Lloyd and Max finally won him over

1660
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:15,120
玛歌从没到排演现场
Margo never came to rehearsal

1661
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:19,200
她说家事太忙了
"Too much to do around the house," she said

1662
01:53:19,330 --> 01:53:23,290
我从不知道比尔和罗维 会如此激烈争吵
I'd never known Bill and Lloyd to fight as bitterly and often,

1663
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:26,040
都是因伊芙惹的祸
and always over some business for Eve,

1664
01:53:26,130 --> 01:53:29,550
为了她的动作或她台词
or a move, or the way she read a speech

1665
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:33,550
我从不知道罗维如此 不尊重比尔的导演
But I'd never known Lloyd to meddle as much with Bill's directing,

1666
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:36,890
只要一牵涉到伊芙便会如此
as far as it affected Eve, that is

1667
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:39,640
然而伊芙说服他们继续下去
Somehow Eve kept them going

1668
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:43,230
比尔退让,罗维似乎很高兴
Bill stuck it out Lloyd seemed happy

1669
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:51,490
我想我最好别再参与排演
And I thought it might be best if I skipped rehearsals from then on

1670
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:57,490
我感觉好像能预知它会发生 而它真的发生
It seemed to me I had known always that it would happen And here it was

1671
01:53:57,580 --> 01:54:02,500
我感到无助 巨大的无助感使我无计可施
I felt helpless That helplessness you feel when you have no talent to offer,

1672
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:04,830
除了对丈夫的爱
outside of loving your husband

1673
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:08,920
我如何去竞争 罗维一切都依赖我
How could I compete? Everything Lloyd loved about me,

1674
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,090
他长时间以来都习惯如此
he'd gotten used to long ago

1675
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:18,180
哈啰!
Hello?

1676
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:20,600
谁? 谁要找瑞奇先生?
Who? Who's calling Mr Richards?

1677
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:24,770
我的名字并不重要 我住在哈林顿小姐对面
My name wouldn't mean anything I room across the hall from Eve Harrington

1678
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:28,440
她身体不适,哭了整晚 就只有低泣,
She isn't well She's been crying all night and she's hysterical

1679
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:30,690
不去看医生
She doesn't want a doctor and

1680
01:54:31,110 --> 01:54:33,190
那是谁?有什么事?
Who is it? What's it all about?

1681
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:37,780
哈林顿小姐叫你 打电话给瑞奇先生吗? 没有,她没叫我打电话
-Did Miss Harrington tell you to call? -Oh, no Eve didn't say to call him

1682
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:41,200
我记得见过瑞奇先生 和她一起几次
I saw Mr Richards with her a couple of times

1683
01:54:41,290 --> 01:54:43,290
我想他们是好朋友
I thought, they being such good friends

1684
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:46,540
哈啰!我是罗维瑞奇 她在哪里?让我跟她说话
This is Lloyd Richards Where is Eve? Let me talk to her

1685
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:49,960
你好,瑞奇先生 她在楼上房间
Hello, Mr Richards She's upstairs in her room

1686
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:53,800
我实在不愿这样打扰你 但伊芙的状况
I really hate to bother you this way, but the way Eve's been feeling,

1687
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,720
我耽心她的病 明天可能不能演出了
I've been worried sick, what with her leaving tomorrow for New Haven

1688
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:00,890
叫她别耽心,我马上过去
Tell her not to worry Tell her I'll be right over

1689
01:55:19,450 --> 01:55:22,830
对戏剧界而言 康乃迪克州的新天堂…
(Addison) To the theatre world, New Haven, Connecticut,

1690
01:55:22,910 --> 01:55:27,750
是舒伯特剧院和塔夫饭店间 的一条短短人行道
is a short stretch of sidewalk between the Shubert Theatre and the Taft Hotel,

1691
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:31,340
被商店重重包围像座小城市
surrounded by what looks very much like a small city

1692
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:36,420
这里的经理称它为出城的门
It is here that managers have what are called out-of-town openings,

1693
01:55:36,510 --> 01:55:40,800
它是供那些纽约人 想出城用的
which are openings for New Yorkers who want to go out of town

1694
01:55:41,510 --> 01:55:44,850
多美好的一天 像是在天堂般
What a day What a heavenly day

1695
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:48,020
诺曼底登陆日 -说得是
-D-day -Just like it

1696
01:55:48,150 --> 01:55:50,060
明早你会觉得
Tomorrow morning, you will have won your beachhead

1697
01:55:50,150 --> 01:55:52,440
人终归要死的
on the shores of immortality

1698
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:54,650
你专栏里最吸引人的描述
Stop rehearsing your column

1699
01:55:55,610 --> 01:55:57,610
实在很怪
Isn’t it strange, Addison?

1700
01:55:57,700 --> 01:56:01,910
我觉得很恐慌,想逃避他们
I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something

1701
01:56:01,990 --> 01:56:06,200
一直不想等待夜晚的降临 怕到手了又失掉
Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come To come and go

1702
01:56:06,370 --> 01:56:08,620
你对明日那么肯定吗?
Are you that sure of tomorrow?

1703
01:56:08,710 --> 01:56:11,380
-你不是吗? -坦白说,是的
-Aren't you? -Frankly, yes

1704
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:20,050
将是个永生难忘的一夜
It'll be a night to remember

1705
01:56:20,140 --> 01:56:22,890
我终于梦想成真
It'll bring me everything I've ever wanted

1706
01:56:22,970 --> 01:56:25,640
-旧旅程结束,新旅程开始
The end of an old road, the beginning of a new one

1707
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:29,980
-旅途上铺满钻石和黄金?-你对我的了解不只那样
-All paved with diamonds and gold? -You know me better than that

1708
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:32,150
-追求新战利品
Paved with what, then?

1709
01:56:33,070 --> 01:56:35,150
没错
Stars

1710
01:56:36,230 --> 01:56:38,240
几点了?
What time?

1711
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:40,400
才四点而已
Almost four

1712
01:56:40,990 --> 01:56:43,320
有足够时间可长睡一下
Plenty of time for a nice, long nap

1713
01:56:43,410 --> 01:56:45,910
我昨晚睡得不好
We rehearsed most of last night

1714
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:48,250
-你现在可以睡得着吗?
You could sleep now, couldn't you?

1715
01:56:48,330 --> 01:56:51,420
-有何不可? 杰出的冷血杀手
-Why not? -The mark of a true killer

1716
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:55,590
安然熟睡, 再出来战斗
Sleep tight, rest easy and come out fighting

1717
01:56:55,670 --> 01:56:58,420
你为何叫我杀手?
Why did you call me a killer?

1718
01:56:58,510 --> 01:57:02,760
我说杀手意思指冠军 我用了我的拳击术语
Did I say killer? I meant champion I get my boxing terms mixed

1719
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:07,430
艾德生,进来几分钟好吗?
Addison, come in for a minute, will you?

1720
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:10,020
我有件事要告诉你
I've got something to tell you

1721
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:23,200
很美但很贵的酒 这不会太奢侈吗?
Suites are for expense accounts You're being extravagant

1722
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:28,120
麦斯买的 他和罗维有喝酒习惯 不过罗维坚持要买
Max is paying for it He and Lloyd had a terrific row, but Lloyd insisted

1723
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:33,870
你想喝酒吗? 那么说是强迫中奖的啰!
-Can I fix you a drink? -With the reluctant compliments of Max?

1724
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:36,460
是罗维,我没有这种嗜好
Lloyd I never have any

1725
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:39,800
我们收工后,他喜欢喝几杯 所以装这组酒
He likes a few drinks after we finish, so he sent it up

1726
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:43,970
真有情调 罗维一定一心想把你棒上天
Some plain soda Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven

1727
01:57:44,090 --> 01:57:47,560
一半是为了今晚 你也在邀请之列
That's for tonight You're invited

1728
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:50,890
我们邀请所有参加演出的人
We're having everyone up after the performance

1729
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:52,980
-我们吗?
"We are?"

1730
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:55,150
-罗维和我
Lloyd and I

1731
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:59,320
-我发现这情况对凯伦很不利
I find it odd that Karen isn't here for the opening

1732
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:01,990
-艾德生 你对罗维用情
-Addison -She was always so devoted to Lloyd

1733
01:58:02,070 --> 01:58:04,280
不觉得会深深伤害凯伦吗?
One would think only death could keep her

1734
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:05,820
艾德生
Addison

1735
01:58:05,950 --> 01:58:12,500
我说这将是永生难忘的一夜 我心中所有愿望终于成真
I said this would be a night to remember, that it would bring me all I ever wanted

1736
01:58:12,580 --> 01:58:14,370
对,旧旅程结束
Oh, yes Something about an old road ending

1737
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:17,170
而新旅途开始
and a new one starting, all paved with stars

1738
01:58:17,290 --> 01:58:19,840
-我指的不仅是戏剧
I didn't mean just the theatre

1739
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:22,010
-还有什么?
What else?

1740
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:27,300
罗维 瑞奇
Lloyd Richards

1741
01:58:27,680 --> 01:58:31,310
他将离开凯伦 我们要结婚了
He's going to leave Karen We're going to be married

1742
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:35,600
是那么回事,罗维
So that's it Lloyd

1743
01:58:35,690 --> 01:58:38,440
终究还是在演戏
Still just the theatre, after all

1744
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:40,520
没有其它目的
It's nothing of the kind

1745
01:58:40,610 --> 01:58:42,820
罗维爱我 我爱他
Lloyd loves me I love him

1746
01:58:43,030 --> 01:58:44,740
我不了解罗维和他的爱
I know nothing of Lloyd's loves

1747
01:58:44,820 --> 01:58:47,360
也不想去了解,但我很了解你
I leave those to Louisa May Alcott But I know you

1748
01:58:47,490 --> 01:58:49,200
我和罗维相爱
I'm in love with Lloyd

1749
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:52,370
在美国罗维 瑞奇是 最成功的商业剧作家
He is a commercially successful playwright

1750
01:58:52,700 --> 01:58:56,290
你无权说这种话 技术上那真是前途看好
-You have no right to say that -And, artistically, very promising

1751
01:58:56,370 --> 01:58:58,670
亲爱的伊芙,这对象该是我
Eve, dear, this is Addison

1752
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:03,210
艾德生,那不是很完美吗?
Oh, Addison, won't it be just perfect?

1753
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:06,800
罗维和我 -我们未来发展真是无可限量
Lloyd and I There's no telling how far we can go

1754
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:10,470
他会为我写伟大的作品 我会使那些剧作不朽
He'll write great plays for me I'll make them great

1755
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:13,470
除了罗维和我之外 我只告诉你一个人
You're the only one who knows, except Lloyd and me

1756
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:15,640
-还有凯伦 -她不知道
-And Karen -She doesn't know

1757
01:59:15,730 --> 01:59:18,730
-她很清楚知道他不会来 -并不完全了解
-She knows enough not to be here -But not all of it

1758
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:21,980
她不知道罗维和我要结婚了 -我明白了
-Not that Lloyd and I are gonna be married -I see

1759
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:25,740
你们何时最后一次见面?
And when was this unholy alliance joined?

1760
01:59:25,820 --> 01:59:29,320
我们前天晚上决定的 在我们到这里之前
We decided night before last, before we came up here

1761
01:59:29,410 --> 01:59:32,660
我相信当时情景 一定很罗曼蒂克
I trust the setting was properly romantic

1762
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:36,410
淡淡的烛光,舞台上有 吉普赛小提琴的演奏
Lights on dimmers and gypsy violins offstage

1763
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:38,920
情景并不罗曼蒂克
The setting wasn't romantic,

1764
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,090
不过罗维却是
but Lloyd was

1765
01:59:41,170 --> 01:59:44,510
他清晨三点来这里敲我的门
He woke me up at three o'clock in the morning, banging on my door

1766
01:59:44,590 --> 01:59:48,090
说他睡不着 他离开凯伦
He couldn't sleep, he said He'd left Karen

1767
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:52,760
无法再写剧本 除非我答应嫁给他
Couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him

1768
01:59:52,850 --> 01:59:55,770
我们不断的谈直到天亮
We sat and talked until it was light

1769
01:59:55,850 --> 01:59:58,190
他没有回家
He never went home

1770
01:59:58,270 --> 02:00:02,690
-你们一直谈到天亮吗? -我们不断谈话
-You sat and talked until it was light? -We sat and talked, Addison

1771
02:00:03,690 --> 02:00:06,240
我要整理他的剧本合约
I want a run-of-the-play contract

1772
02:00:07,860 --> 02:00:12,030
像你这种人真是空前绝后
There never was, and there never will be, another like you

1773
02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:15,620
说句祝福话,什么都行
Well, say something Anything

1774
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:18,370
恭喜!太棒!干得好!
Congratulations Skål Good work, Eve

1775
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:27,340
-你把我当成什么了?
What do you take me for?

1776
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:29,970
-我不知道,但你很有份量
I don't know that I "take you" for anything

1777
02:00:30,050 --> 02:00:33,220
可能吗?你竟用这种落伍的
Is it possible that you've confused me

1778
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:36,470
小孩游戏技俩想来困惑我
with those backward children you've played tricks on?

1779
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:39,390
对我跟对他们没二样
That you have the same contempt for me as for them?

1780
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:42,150
我知道你话中有特别的意义 但我不明白是什么?
I'm sure you mean something, but I don't know what

1781
02:00:42,270 --> 02:00:44,820
看清楚,伊芙 这次你死定了
Look closely, Eve It's time you did

1782
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:49,950
我是艾德生 杜维特 可不是你手中玩弄的傻瓜
I am Addison DeWitt I'm nobody's fool, least of all yours

1783
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:54,410
-我从没有那种念头 -你有而且你仍然是
-I never intended you to be -Yes, you did, and you still do

1784
02:00:54,490 --> 02:00:58,160
-我还是不明白你在说什么 -现在我想午睡,重要的是
I don't know what you mean But I want to take my nap It's important

1785
02:00:58,250 --> 02:01:02,080
-现在重要的是我们谈一谈 -杀手对杀手 -冠军对冠军
-It's important that we talk, killer to killer -Champion to champion

1786
02:01:02,170 --> 02:01:05,170
在我眼里你不算冠军 你太不入流了
Not with me, you're no champion You're stepping up

1787
02:01:05,250 --> 02:01:07,960
艾德生,请你坦白说清楚
Please say what you have to say, plainly and distinctly,

1788
02:01:08,050 --> 02:01:09,590
然后出去,我想午睡
and then let me take my nap

1789
02:01:09,670 --> 02:01:15,510
很好,坦白而清楚 但没那必要 你跟我一样明白我要说的话
Very well Although it's unnecessary, because you know what I'm going to say

1790
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:19,430
罗维可能会离开凯伦 但绝不是为了你
Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you

1791
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:23,850
你这话是什么意思? 说得更坦白,更清楚点
-What do you mean by that? -More plainly and more distinctly?

1792
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:27,520
我没到新天堂去看戏 或讨论你的梦想
I have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams,

1793
02:01:27,650 --> 02:01:30,440
或从耶鲁墙上拉下长春藤
or pull the ivy from the walls of Yale

1794
02:01:30,530 --> 02:01:34,280
我是来告诉你不能嫁给罗维 或其他人
I came to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd, or anyone else,

1795
02:01:34,370 --> 02:01:36,450
因为我不允许
because I will not permit it

1796
02:01:36,530 --> 02:01:39,160
这跟你有何关? 一切都有关
-What have you got to do with it? -Everything

1797
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:42,870
因为今晚之后 你将属于我
Because after tonight you will belong to me

1798
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:46,380
属于…你?
Belong? To you?

1799
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:49,380
-我不相信我的耳朵
I can't believe my ears

1800
02:01:49,510 --> 02:01:51,470
-成年人的陈腐之言
A dull cliché

1801
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:53,720
属于你
"Belong" to you?

1802
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:57,050
听来多邪恶 好像中古世纪的话
That sounds medieval Something out of an old melodrama

1803
02:01:57,140 --> 02:02:00,310
它比历史还老20年
So does the history of the world for the past 20 years

1804
02:02:00,390 --> 02:02:02,480
你的反应令我生气
I don't enjoy putting it this bluntly

1805
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:06,060
坦白说我希望你会了解 并视为当然,我和你是一对
I'd hoped that you would have taken it for granted that you and I

1806
02:02:06,190 --> 02:02:08,230
视为理所当然?
"Taken it for granted?"

1807
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:10,400
我俩?哈!
"That you and I ?"

1808
02:02:15,490 --> 02:02:18,660
牢牢记住只要你活着一天 绝不要嘲笑我
Now remember, as long as you live, never to laugh at me

1809
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:21,750
你可嘲笑任何人或任何事 但绝不能笑我
At anything or anyone else, but never at me

1810
02:02:25,250 --> 02:02:29,170
-滚出去 -你这么做太冲动
-Get out -You're too short for that gesture

1811
02:02:29,250 --> 02:02:31,760
再说你这样太冒险了
Besides, it went out with Mrs Fiske

1812
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:36,090
若你不滚,我就叫人 把你丢出去
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out

1813
02:02:36,180 --> 02:02:39,180
别拿电话!别去碰
Don't pick up that phone Don't even touch it

1814
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:41,770
有件事会使你乖乖听我的
Something told you to do what I said, didn't it?

1815
02:02:41,850 --> 02:02:45,690
那种直觉值得几百万 是你买不到的,伊芙
That instinct is worth millions You can't buy it, Eve Cherish it

1816
02:02:45,770 --> 02:02:49,230
好好谈吧!我们放下武装 彼此放松心情
When that alarm goes off, go to your battle stations

1817
02:02:50,440 --> 02:02:55,110
现在开始,你名字不叫伊芙.哈林顿 而是叫葛芙 芬斯基
To begin with, your name is not Eve Harrington It's Gertrude Slescynski

1818
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:56,320
那又怎么样?
What of it?

1819
02:02:56,410 --> 02:02:59,030
事实上你父母很穷 他们还活着
True, your parents were poor, and still are

1820
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:01,370
他们想知道你现在如何? 在何处?
They would like to know how you are

1821
02:03:01,450 --> 02:03:03,870
-他们三年来没有你音讯了
They haven't heard from you for three years

1822
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:06,040
-那又如何?
What of it?

1823
02:03:06,710 --> 02:03:08,790
这件事你看如何
A matter of opinion, granted

1824
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:11,380
你在布威尔工作那是事实
It's also true you worked in a brewery

1825
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:15,130
但你在布威尔的生活 显然不是你所描述的那样
But life there was not as dull as you pictured it

1826
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:20,050
事实上你是老板娘 请侦探来跟踪的对象
It got less and less dull, until your boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives

1827
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:24,060
她从没证明过任何事 -但花了五百块叫你离镇
-She never proved a thing! -But the $500 you got to get out of town

1828
02:03:24,140 --> 02:03:27,390
打发你来纽约,不是吗?
brought you straight to New York, didn't it?

1829
02:03:35,650 --> 02:03:38,320
付五百块打发你到纽约 对不对?
That $500 brought you straight to New York

1830
02:03:38,410 --> 02:03:40,320
他是个骗子,骗子!
She was a liar She was a liar!

1831
02:03:40,410 --> 02:03:44,080
回答我的问题 他是不是付你钱叫你离镇?
Answer my question Weren't you paid to get out of town?

1832
02:03:47,330 --> 02:03:50,830
根本没有艾迪,没有飞行员 你没结过婚
There was no Eddie, no pilot You've never been married

1833
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:53,920
那位女人深爱的死亡英雄
That was not only a lie, it was an insult to dead heroes

1834
02:03:54,010 --> 02:03:56,050
不仅是欺骗而且是侮辱
and the women who loved them

1835
02:03:56,130 --> 02:04:00,340
旧金山根本没有舒伯特戏院 你也从未到过旧金山
San Francisco has no Shubert Theatre You've never been to San Francisco

1836
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:04,100
这是个愚笨的说谎者 很容易被看穿,那不是你
That was a stupid lie, easy to expose, not worthy of you

1837
02:04:04,180 --> 02:04:06,140
我当时一定得见到玛歌呀!
I had to get in to meet Margo

1838
02:04:06,230 --> 02:04:09,350
我总得说些话,变成某人 让她喜欢我
I had to say something, be somebody Make her like me!

1839
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:11,770
她真的很喜欢你,帮助你 信任你
She did like you She helped and trusted you

1840
02:04:11,860 --> 02:04:14,780
你却忘恩负义 -这不是事实
-You repaid her by trying to win Bill -That's not true!

1841
02:04:14,860 --> 02:04:19,030
-我在场 我看到你,如何伤害她
I was there I saw you and heard you through the dressing-room door

1842
02:04:19,860 --> 02:04:23,530
你利用我的名字和专栏 来威胁凯伦 获得蔻拉那角色
You used my name to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of Cora

1843
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:26,700
这件事你骗了我 不!不!
-You lied to me about it -No!

1844
02:04:26,870 --> 02:04:29,620
我又不是三小时前 才开始和凯伦吃午饭
I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago

1845
02:04:29,710 --> 02:04:34,710
从她说的话,我了解真相 比她所知的还多
As always with women who try to find out things, she told more than she learnt

1846
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:37,010
现在你又想改口,
Now do you want to change your story

1847
02:04:37,090 --> 02:04:39,800
前晚 罗维在你门口向你求婚吗?
about Lloyd beating at your door that night?

1848
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:41,720
拜托!求求你!
Please, please

1849
02:04:46,310 --> 02:04:51,480
你这种行为真叫人震惊
That I should want you at all suddenly strikes me as the height of improbability

1850
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:55,230
应该让你自生自灭的
But that in itself is probably the reason

1851
02:04:55,320 --> 02:05:00,150
大概是起了恻隐之心吧! 伊芙,你我都不是正经人物 这点我们是相同的
You're an improbable person, Eve, and so am I We have that in common

1852
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:04,580
而且都轻视人性 无法爱人或被爱
Also a contempt for humanity, an inability to love and be loved

1853
02:05:04,660 --> 02:05:08,410
还有永不知足的野心和才气
Insatiable ambition and talent

1854
02:05:08,540 --> 02:05:12,000
我们应彼此互属对方 你在听我说吗?
We deserve each other Are you listening to me?

1855
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:17,210
出声啊! 是的,我在听
-Then say so -Yes, Addison

1856
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:21,550
你也明白且同意 你完全属于我吧?
And you realize and you agree how completely you belong to me?

1857
02:05:22,010 --> 02:05:23,590
是的!
Yes, Addison

1858
02:05:24,260 --> 02:05:27,600
那就去午睡,祝你今晚好运
Then take your nap, and good luck for tonight

1859
02:05:32,770 --> 02:05:34,860
今晚我不能表演
I won't play tonight

1860
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:39,530
我办不到,不可能的 我无法再演下去
I couldn't Not possibly I couldn't go on

1861
02:05:39,610 --> 02:05:43,860
不能再演下去? 你的生命都献给表演了
"Couldn't go on"? You'll give the performance of your life

1862
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:05,550
于是她将生命都献给了表演
(Addison) And she gave the performance of her life

1863
02:06:05,640 --> 02:06:08,390
那一晚是值得回忆的
And it was a night to remember, that night

1864
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:21,650
莎拉奖的诸位高贵委员
Honored members of the Sarah Siddons Society,

1865
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:25,160
诸位贵宾,女士先生们
distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen

1866
02:06:26,490 --> 02:06:28,910
我应该说些什么呢?
What is there for me to say?

1867
02:06:28,990 --> 02:06:32,500
所有名言绢语都有人说过
Everything wise and witty has long since been said

1868
02:06:32,580 --> 02:06:37,000
他们比我更有智慧才气
by minds more mature and talents far greater than mine

1869
02:06:37,130 --> 02:06:40,590
如果要我也同样来谢谢你们 那就不必了
For me to thank you as equals would be presumptuous

1870
02:06:40,670 --> 02:06:43,170
我只不过是戏剧中的学徒
I am an apprentice in the theatre,

1871
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:46,430
要跟诸位学习的地方还很多
and have much to learn from all of you

1872
02:06:46,510 --> 02:06:50,180
我只想说我既高兴又骄傲
Let me say only that I am proud and happy,

1873
02:06:51,140 --> 02:06:54,180
当我论及这祟高的荣耀
and that I regard this great honor

1874
02:06:54,270 --> 02:06:57,440
我的成就在世上并不足为道
not so much as an award for what I have achieved,

1875
02:06:57,520 --> 02:07:00,940
而是面对将来我尚未达成的
but as a standard to hold against what I have yet to accomplish

1876
02:07:03,190 --> 02:07:08,200
再说我这次的得奖 我只是小小一部份
And, further, that I regard it as bestowed upon me only in part

1877
02:07:09,370 --> 02:07:13,870
最大荣耀应属于戏剧界朋友
The larger share belongs to my friends in the theatre,

1878
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,540
及戏剧的本身
and to the theatre itself

1879
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:19,540
它给了我所有的
which has given me all I have

1880
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:25,170
凭良心说 这成果该归功于你们
In good conscience, I must give credit where credit is due

1881
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:30,300
感谢麦斯 法宾,亲爱的麦斯
To Max Fabian Dear Max

1882
02:07:30,810 --> 02:07:34,980
亲爱的,富感情,慷慨 又勇敢的麦斯 法宾
Dear sentimental, generous, courageous Max Fabian,

1883
02:07:35,060 --> 02:07:38,900
他给了无名气,没有经验 的业余演员一个机会
who took a chance on an unknown, untried amateur

1884
02:07:43,570 --> 02:07:47,150
感谢我戏剧界第一个朋友
To my first friend in the theatre,

1885
02:07:47,240 --> 02:07:51,160
她的仁慈和善意 我将永志难忘
whose kindness and graciousness I shall never forget,

1886
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:53,740
凯伦 罗维夫人
Karen Mrs Lloyd Richards

1887
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:03,920
是凯伦带我去见一个 我永远喜爱的明星
It was Karen who first brought me to one whom I'd always idolized,

1888
02:08:04,010 --> 02:08:07,340
一个成为我的恩人 才有今日的获奖
one who became my benefactress and champion

1889
02:08:08,550 --> 02:08:12,390
伟大的女演员 以及伟大的女人
A great actress and a great woman,

1890
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:14,310
玛歌.嘉琳
Margo Channing

1891
02:08:19,770 --> 02:08:22,190
感谢我的导演
To my director,

1892
02:08:22,270 --> 02:08:27,190
他总是要求我很高
who demanded always a little more than my talent could provide,

1893
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:30,030
但他却耐心地教导我
but who taught me patiently and well,

1894
02:08:31,620 --> 02:08:33,080
比尔 辛普生
Bill Sampson

1895
02:08:36,540 --> 02:08:40,620
还有一位,没有他伟大的剧本
And one without whose great play and faith in me,

1896
02:08:41,290 --> 02:08:44,130
就没有今晚的我
this night could never have been

1897
02:08:44,210 --> 02:08:46,510
我该如何报答罗维 瑞奇呢
How can I repay Lloyd Richards?

1898
02:08:49,470 --> 02:08:51,800
叫我该如何报答其它的人呢
How can I repay the many others,

1899
02:08:51,930 --> 02:08:54,970
实在太多,我无法一一指名
so many, I couldn't possibly name them all,

1900
02:08:55,100 --> 02:08:58,140
他们的协助,指导和忠告
whose help, guidance, and advice

1901
02:08:59,730 --> 02:09:04,820
让今晚成为我生命中 最快乐的一晚,或许吧
have made this, the happiest night of my life, possible

1902
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:13,240
虽然我将在下星期 到好莱坞拍片
Although I am going to Hollywood next week to make a film,

1903
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:16,660
千万别认为我会离开你们
do not think for a moment that I am leaving you

1904
02:09:16,740 --> 02:09:18,910
我怎么能呢?
How could I?

1905
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,830
我的心在此,在剧场中
My heart is here in the theatre,

1906
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:26,420
但是离开你们的心 三千哩是太远了
and 3,000 miles are too far to be away from one's heart

1907
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:29,510
我会尽快回来相聚
I'll be back to claim it, and soon

1908
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:35,180
当然是如果你们要我回来
That is, if you want me back

1909
02:09:41,690 --> 02:09:44,940
各位!晚安!
Good night to you all, and to all, a good night

1910
02:09:52,530 --> 02:09:57,030
不管如何,这应该归功于你,达令
For services rendered beyond whatever it is of duty, darling

1911
02:10:01,830 --> 02:10:07,130
快走吧!我是主人 我得在我的宾客尿裤子前 赶到家才行的
Come on, I'm the host I got to get home before my guests start stealing the liquor

1912
02:10:09,880 --> 02:10:12,720
-恭喜!伊芙 -凯伦,谢谢你

Nice speech, Eve But I wouldn't worry too much about your heart

1915
02:10:25,730 --> 02:10:29,520
你可把奖座跟你心摆在一起
You can always put that award where your heart ought to be

1916
02:10:32,030 --> 02:10:34,070
我想酒大概都没剩吧!
I don't suppose there's a drink left?

1917
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:36,990
-麦斯待会要开个酒会 -我不会去的
-You can have one at Max's -I don't think I'm going

1918
02:10:37,070 --> 02:10:41,080
-为什么呢? -因为我不想
-Why not? -Because I don't want to

1919
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:44,750
-我真为你感到高兴,伊芙 -非常感谢
-I'm so happy for you, Eve -Thank you so much

1920
02:10:46,250 --> 02:10:47,830
麦斯恐怕会很麻烦的
Max has gone to a lot of trouble

1921
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:51,340
这是为你的胜利所开的派对
This is going to be an elaborate party and it's for you

1922
02:10:51,420 --> 02:10:54,930
不,他不是,是为了这个
No, it isn't It's for this

1923
02:10:55,050 --> 02:10:57,760
-是同样的东西,不是吗? -正是!
-It's the same thing, isn't it? -Exactly

1924
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:01,930
-拿这个代替我去参加派对好了
Here, take it to the party instead of me

1925
02:11:02,020 --> 02:11:04,270
-你太孩子气了!
You're being very childish

1926
02:11:04,350 --> 02:11:08,520
-我累了,想回家 -很好 我送你回家
-I'm tired I want to go home -Very well I'll drop you off

1927
02:11:08,610 --> 02:11:12,280
我自己去参加宴会
I shall go to the party alone I have no intention of missing it

1928
02:12:38,820 --> 02:12:40,950
-你是谁? -哈林顿小姐
-Who are you? -Miss Harrington

1929
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:44,830
-你在这做什么? 我大概是睡着了
-What are you doing here? -I I guess I fell asleep

1930
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:52,040
千万别叫人逮捕我! 求求你,我并没偷东西 你可以搜我身
Please don't have me arrested I didn't steal anything You can search me

1931
02:12:52,130 --> 02:12:56,050
你怎么进来的? 我来到外面的大厅 直到女佣来清理你的床
-How did you get in here? -I hid outside till the maid came in

1932
02:12:56,170 --> 02:12:58,970
她大概忘了什么又走回来 走时,忘了关上门
She went out to get something and left the door open

1933
02:12:59,050 --> 02:13:03,140
我溜进来,直到她清理完毕 我只是四处看看
I sneaked in and hid till she'd finished Then I just looked around

1934
02:13:03,220 --> 02:13:06,970
怕引起注意,把灯全关了
I was afraid someone would notice the lights were on, so I turned them off

1935
02:13:07,060 --> 02:13:10,640
然后我大概就睡着了 -你只是四处看看?
-Then I guess I fell asleep -You were just looking around?

1936
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:12,650
-就只这样 -为什么?
-That's all -What for?

1937
02:13:12,730 --> 02:13:15,400
-你大概不会相信我的 -大概不会
-You probably won't believe me -Probably not

1938
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:17,980
-是关于我的报导 -什么报导?对谁的报导?
-It was for my report -What report? To whom?

1939
02:13:18,070 --> 02:13:20,900
关于你的起居 你穿什么样的衣服
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear,

1940
02:13:21,030 --> 02:13:25,160
香水,书籍,这类的事
what kind of perfume and books, things like that

1941
02:13:25,240 --> 02:13:29,250
你晓得你拥有许多高中 女学生组成的影友会
You know the Eve Harrington Club that they have in most girls' high schools?

1942
02:13:29,370 --> 02:13:33,330
我听说过 我是第一位发起人
-I've heard of them -Ours was one of the first, Erasmus Hall

1943
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:37,750
影友会的主席 -俄伦斯弗高中 -在布鲁克林区是吧!
-I'm the president -Erasmus Hall That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?

1944

还有许多女影星来自 布鲁克林区 有芭芭拉史丹妃,苏珊海华
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn Barbara Stanwyck and Susan Hayward

1945
02:13:42,340 --> 02:13:44,760
当然她们只是电影明星
Of course, they're just movie stars

1946
02:13:44,850 --> 02:13:47,510
你要去好莱坞,是吗?
You're going to Hollywood, aren't you?

1947
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:48,770
是的
Mm-hm

1948
02:13:48,930 --> 02:13:52,600
看你收拾的行李 一定是要待很久啰!
From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time

1949
02:13:52,690 --> 02:13:54,770
或许吧!
I might

1950
02:13:58,780 --> 02:14:01,700
那些泼出来的饮料 会弄坏你的地毯
That spilled drink's gonna ruin your carpet

1951
02:14:01,780 --> 02:14:04,280
明早再清理!
Maid'll fix it in the morning

1952
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:08,120
-我来清理吧! -别麻烦了

要多久?
How long does it take?

1955
02:14:15,460 --> 02:14:18,380
不太一定,一个多小时吧!
With changing and everything, a little over an hour

1956
02:14:18,460 --> 02:14:22,130
够久了,你到家会很晚
It's after one now You won't get home till all hours

1957
02:14:23,970 --> 02:14:26,050
我不在乎回不了家
I don't care if I never get home

1958
02:14:28,430 --> 02:14:30,470
门铃!

02:15:15,690 --> 02:15:21,020
菲比,告诉我 你希不希望将来自己能有 一座这样的奖杯?
Tell me, Phoebe, do you want someday to have an award like that of your own?

1970
02:15:21,110 --> 02:15:26,530
超过世界上的任何东西 那你得问哈小姐怎么得到的?
-More than anything else in the world -Then ask Miss Harrington how to get one

1971
02:15:27,700 --> 02:15:30,620
哈小姐,她一清二楚
Miss Harrington knows all about it

1972
02:15:39,170 --> 02:15:41,290
是谁呀!
