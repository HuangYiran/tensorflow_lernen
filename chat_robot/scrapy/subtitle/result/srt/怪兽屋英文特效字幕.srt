00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,600
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, he did it again. He took another tricycle.

17
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,070
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, honey, we've talked about this.

18
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You cannot stay up in your room all day...

19

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, Mom, there's something wrong with that house.

21
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,110
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm serious.

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,150
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that?

23
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,510
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm serious.

24
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His voice sounds funny.

25

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,750
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you should come with us.

28
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,930
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, the boy's too busy. He's got his spying to do.

29
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,130
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not spying.

30
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,900
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well...

31

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Well..." That's okay, buddy.

32
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,610
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I was your age, I did exactly the same thing.

33
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course, it was with binoculars and involved the lovely Jensen twins.

34
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,570
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neither of which was as lovely as your beautiful mother.

35
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,220
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you be an angel and help me bring out the incisor?

36
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,610
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The incisor.  Hold this.

37
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you don't wanna forget that.

38

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Elizabeth will be here in a few hours.

39
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,330
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If anything happens, call the police and hide.

40
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He knows that.

41
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,610
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you tomorrow night.

42
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,780
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have you done?  Just let me drive this thing, will you?

43
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,540
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is DJ? Where's DJ?  I'm fine.

44
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,480
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You would be so happy if he was under the car, wouldn't you?

45
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,880
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. It's hard to see with the mask on.

46
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,580
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then why don't you keep it off, Chowder?

47
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,620
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did you put up your window?

48
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,590
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chowder.  It's aerodynamic.

49
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,260
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, DJ.  We've got to make time.

50
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,900
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The children. The children.

51
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,860
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What children?  Bye-bye, baby.

52
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,400
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell him you love him, dear.  He knows that.

53
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,130
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell your son you love him.  I don't wanna tell him.

54
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,900
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He knows I love him.  He's your son.

55
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,300
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to say it. Roll it down.  We're gonna be late.

56
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,670
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We both love you.

57
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,250
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That includes your dad.  That's right.

58
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,480
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's had enough kisses.  Blow him a kiss.

59
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,520
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blow him a kiss.  Goodbye.

60
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,180
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheer up. It's almost Halloween.

61
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,520
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In one day and three hours, it's candy time.

62
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,070
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay?

63
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,330
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check it out, I got a new ball.  Cool.

64
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,530
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, speaking of which, have you decided?

65
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,110
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Skullzor or Crypt Keeper?

66
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chowder.

67
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think I'm going trick-or-treating this year.

68
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,580
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

69
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,260
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, you're gonna break a six-year streak.

70
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, six years of being jumped and egged.

71
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe I'm getting too grown-up.

72
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,500
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three seconds on the clock.

73
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,540
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm playing basketball.

74
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,010
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time for an in-your-face disgrace.

75
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,220
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?  My nose is in my brains.

76
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,190
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me see. Oh, my God.

77
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?  You're a dork.

78
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,090
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's my ball?

79
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,600
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

80
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,010
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, man.  Wait, wait. DJ.

81
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,520
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a grownup now, you go get it.

82
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,920
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chowder, your ball just landed on Nebbercracker's lawn.

83
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,460
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't exist anymore.

84
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,070
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I paid $28 for that ball.

85
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:36,610
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I raked 10 yards and asked my mom for a dollar 26 times.

86
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,810
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never worked that hard in my life...

87
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,350
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nebbercracker hasn't come out yet.

88
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So?  So maybe he's sleeping.

89
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,880
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, I'll do it.

90
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,090
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll never forget this. Hurry, though.

91
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go.

92
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,400
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You.

93
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.  DJ, run!

94
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,750
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the ball and run!

95
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,390
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're so close.

96
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,080
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have you done?

97
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,090
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just nudge it over here.  I'm so sorry.

98
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,850
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm so, so, so sorry. I didn't mean...

99
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,620
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are dead.

100
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,700
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}DJ, come on, come on!

102
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,760
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help. Chowder.

103
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,700

104
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,600
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think you can terrorize my lawn?  No, I'm sorry.

105
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,940
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna be a dead person?  No. I love life.

106
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,170
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This place is not a playground for children.

107
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,220
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got it from now on.  This is my house!

108
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why can't you respect that?

109
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why can't you just stay away from?

110
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,630
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Push.

111
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,100
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No siren. Never a good sign.

112
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,580
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a murderer.

113
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,390
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you're not.  I'm not?

114
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,520
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When it's an accident, they call it manslaughter.

115
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,220
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I'm gonna throw up.

116
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,160
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. Babysitter's here.

117
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,630
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you, DJ.

118
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,930
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perfect.

119
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,700


120
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,200
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}DJ.

121
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,370
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, DJ, I just saw an ambulance. Did I miss anything interesting?

122
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,740
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

123
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,450
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Elizabeth...

124
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...can I talk to you about something?

125
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,090
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah, of course you can, cantaloupe.

126
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,090
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are gonna have the bestest time.

127
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,590
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got tons of neat activities planned.  They already left.

128
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They did? They're gone?  Yes, and I need to talk to you.

129
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,470
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So the usual deal: Indoors by 9, in your room by 11.

130
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,330
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lights out, your call.  Elizabeth.

131
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's Zee.  "Zee"?

132
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,670
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, listen up. I control the TV, the stereo and the phone.

133
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,110
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't do board games, Shrinky Dinks or tuck-ins.

134
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,510
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not your mother. I'm not your friend.

135
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,850
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't talk to me like I'm a baby, okay? I am practically a grownup.

136
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,680
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even need you here, Elizabeth.

137
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,090
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gosh, DJ, why'd you break that?  But I didn't.

138
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, let me ask you something. Who are they gonna believe?

139
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,140
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go to your room.  Fine.

140
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,470


141
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,910


142
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,510
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

143
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,690
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

144
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,320
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

145
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, very funny. See how you like it.

146
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,370
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Happy Halloween, doofus.

147
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice one, Bones.

148
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,510
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at his face. That's funny.

149
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,680
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not supposed to have friends over. Who's this?

150
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Bones.  What's up?

151
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,040
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's in a band.  That's right.

152
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,380
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, anyway, cantaloupe, let's not open up the rulebook, okay?

153
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,960
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Since you're up way past your bedtime.

154
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,060
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, this is different. Listen.

155
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,500
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You called the neighbors. Good for you.

156
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,370
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used star-69. He called me.

157
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,300
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who called you?  Nebbercracker.

158
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,870
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}P.S., he died today.

159
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,380
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You lie.  Do not.

160
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He died, and now I'm getting phone calls from his house.

161
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A phone call from beyond the grave.

162
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, come on. I'm serious.

163
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, he's serious. Did you know he was serious?

164
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,400
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, man, give her back.  Oh, "her"? You mind?

165
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,500
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, come on. Gross.

166
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,400
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Bones.  Wait, hold on, dude. I th...

167
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,740
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's having trouble breathing. Might have something in her throat.

168
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,240
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, I'll look into it.

169
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,710
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Elizabeth. No.  Okay, Bones, knock it off.

170
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,710
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Downstairs, now.

171
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,380
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, kid, can't play anymore.

172
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,550
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are so funny.

173
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,690
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. It's like I don't even try and it just happens.

174
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God, stop doing this.

175
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,750
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah? What you gonna do?

176
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,660
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Homicide.  Chowder, where are your parents?

177
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,130
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dad's at the pharmacy...

178
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,860
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and my mom's at the movies with her personal trainer.

179
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,440
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meet me at the Danger Zone now.  Fine.

180
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:40,670
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bones, I said, knock it off.  Come on, man.

181
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,070
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm creeped out.

182
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,850
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I saw an ambulance here today.

183
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So?

184
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,180
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So maybe Nebbercracker really did die.

185
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,590
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should be so lucky. The guy is evil.

186
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,190
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, he's just a crotchety old dude.

187
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,230
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, really, Zee?

188
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:07,300
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I was 10 years old, I had a kite. Awesome kite.

189
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,960
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could fly it so high you couldn't see it.

190
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,700
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One day, it crashed down.

191
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,870
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I followed the string and it ended right over there...

192
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,610
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...across the street, right at the edge of his lawn.

193
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,720
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did he take your kite?

194
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:35,230
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, he takes whatever lands on his lawn.

195
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,400
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that's not the point.

196
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,200
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The point is, is that I saw him talking to his house...

197
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,570
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and kissing it.

198
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,170
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides...

199
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,610
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...everybody knows what he did to his wife.

200
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,220
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why? What? What did he do to her?

201
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:58,150
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He ate her.  Bones. Get off. Stop it!

202
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,620
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bones, enough.  Come on, Zee.

203
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,620
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bones, I'm so sick of you.

204
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,390
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just...  You have no respect for women.

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you looking at?

210

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really are dead, aren't you?

212
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,580
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm on your lawn, Nebbercracker.

213
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,620
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you gonna do about it, Nebbercracker?

214

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chowder, what are you doing?

224
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,890
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up.

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,190
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

226
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nebbercracker's back from the dead.

00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,740
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make it stop.

239
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,240
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quit screwing around.

00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,560
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Whatever. Let's go.

00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,510
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The haunting is subtle...

249
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,450
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...yet really, really boring.

250
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,620
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I go home now?  Chowder, he'll hear you.

251

00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...this is why nobody will sit next to us at lunch.

253
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:35,030
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll go Ding Dong Ditch the house and you'll see. No ghost.

270
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,880
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I looked back.

271
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,890
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bones?

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Coming.

273
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,220
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't even think about crawling back here...

274
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,260
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trick or treat.

275
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,670
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

276
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,170
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning, ma'am.

277
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,010
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You witnessed a simulation of what you'll face this evening.

278
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Studies show that households that run out of candy...

279
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,110
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...are 55 percent more likely to be TP'd.

280
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,920
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To help avert this tragedy...

281
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:21,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...l'm here selling Halloween candy for my school, Westbrook Prep.

282
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:25,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good school. I got kicked out of there.

283
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,360
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, what do you want?

284
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,600
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just trying to get a head start on life and secure a successful future.

285
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,400
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want a successful future?

286
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,080
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When a guy with tattoos comes up to the drive-through...

287
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,980
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...give him his burger, not your phone number.

288
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,150
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for the advice. I'll be sure to make a note of it.

289
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:49,310
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But back to business. Eggs, shaving cream, toilet paper.

290
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,720
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Without candy, I'm afraid your house is a bull's-eye with shingles.

291
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:57,300
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice try. It's not my house.

292
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,520
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Babysitter?

293
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,400
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, let's cut the crap.

294
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,900
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe the parents you work for left you $40 in emergency money.

295
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,040
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe they left me 30.

296
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:12,950
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you give me 20, I write a receipt for 30 and you pocket 10.

297
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,140
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe.

298
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:18,480
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I want two extra bags of peanut clusters.

299
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,590
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One bag and I'll toss in a licorice whip.

300
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,650
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're good.

301
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,970
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eight a.m. No detectable movement.

302
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,870
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No detectable movement.

303
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, DJ, I brought you some chocolate.

304
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,350
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cover blown?

305
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,720
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No detectable movement.

306
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,050
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you two weirdoes up to?

307
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,560
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, nothing.

308
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,730
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just something in the house across the street just tried to eat us.

00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,520
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Start explaining.  All right, the house, it tried to eat us.

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about? That one's your pee.

407
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's yours.  It's his.

412
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you hate Mexican food, huh?

413
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,850
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. You too, huh?

414
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,390
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, in fact, you might say I started hating it first.

415
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,290
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Outside in front of the house?

416
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,530
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. Let's get technical.  Okay.

417
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,670
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I started hating it through the telescope.

418
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,860
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't call dibs on a girl through a telescope.

419
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,560
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't call dibs on a girl.

420
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,300
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just did.  Me too.

421
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,740
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She didn't believe me.

422
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,540
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Authority can be so:

423
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:34,440
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Normally I don't spend time with guys like you.

424
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:39,350
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But a house just tried to eat me, so you've got one hour.

425
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,960
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, a puppy.

426
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,970
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't see that coming.

427
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,200
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay...

428
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,070
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I think it's time to call the police.

429
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,750
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you realize what's gonna happen tonight?

430
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,820
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hundreds of kids walking right up to that house.

431
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:18,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait, wait. Come on. Guys, I think we're overreacting.

432
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,160
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think about it.

433
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:23,670
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only a total moron would walk up to old man Nebbercracker's house.

434
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,330
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, my ball.  Chowder.

435
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,740
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

436
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,880
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna be a bloodbath.

437
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,980
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good news. The cops are here.

438
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,490
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, kids, this better be good.

439
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,360
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was in the forest wrestling with a bear claw when we got the call.

440
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,230
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was eating a doughnut.

441
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:01,030
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All three of you, step to the car now.

442
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,870
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My ears.  They're at the car.

443
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,700
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a rookie. First week on the job.

444
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,470
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Officer, we have reason to believe...

445
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...there's a dangerous creature inside that house.

446
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It may have killed a man.  And a dog.

447
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,710
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doggy down? We've got a situation.

448
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,410
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got a situation.  What are you doing?

449
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,590
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calling for backup. Didn't you hear the kid?

450
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,820
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a dangerous creature inside that house.

451
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't have backup. It's just Judy at the station.

452
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,260
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this is no situation.

453
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,490
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just a couple Tater Tots hopped up on too many Pixy Stix.

454
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,730
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I bet you the dead dog would beg to differ.

455
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that?

456
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,870
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing.

457
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,440
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Time's up, peewees.

458
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Halloween. We got things to do.  We do?

459
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:45,710
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, wait, you can't. All right, this thing, it has a mouth...

460
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,220
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and it comes out and grabs things and pulls them in and eats them.

461
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,480
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, like this:

462
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,920
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay, okay. The thing is...

463
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,890
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...we're trying to make this sound more real than it normally would.

464
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,760
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Problem is it sounds kind of not real.

465
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:04,130
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we'll see you later.  No.

466
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:08,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. I'll show you. But if things get out of hand...

467
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,470
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll aim for Bigfoot.

468
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,670
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's loaded.

469
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,450
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's hopping.

470
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smart house.

471
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,860
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

472
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,930
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You... Both of you. Come here.

473
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,330
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring it to the car.

474
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

475
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:43,440
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna forget you throwing that rock because that dance was pretty funny.

476
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,040
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But next time any of you mess with this guy's house...

477
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,680
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...all three of you are going in the hole, you got it?

478
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,610
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I'll give you 10 seconds to march.

479
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,180
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we need your help.

480
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,380
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your job to help us.

481
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One.  Come on.

482
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,750
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two.

483
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three.

484
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,380
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Four.

485
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,030
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Five.

486
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,850
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's tender.

487
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,160
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My house is right over there.

488
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,090
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So much for relying on the government.

489
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,960
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I know. I hate the government.

490
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,610
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude, we're screwed.  No, we're not.

491
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,240
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll go to an expert.

492
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,970
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're looking at the three-time, tri-state...

493
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,550
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...over-14 "Thou Art Dead" champion.

494
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,190
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His name is Reginald Skulinski. But they call him Skull.

495
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,360
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's "they"?  Me and DJ.

496
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,390
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.  He's the smartest guy on earth.

497
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,090
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So let's go talk to him.

498
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,820
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Jenny, Jenny.  Hey, Jenny, Jenny, hold on. Hold up.

499
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Skull is in the game zone right now.

500
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,690
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't wanna mess with him when he's in the game zone.

501
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine, so how long is he gonna be playing?

502
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,930
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Die. Die.

503
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,030
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who knows? He once played for four days straight...

504
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:58,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...on one quarter, a gallon of chocolate milk and an adult diaper.

505
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,380
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The man's a legend.

506
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,680
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if he's not coming out of the game zone, then we are going in.

507
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:06,220
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Hey, what are you?  What? Jenny, no.

508
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,350
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like you're not gonna... You're not gonna do it. Like...

509
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,620
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna die. You're gonna die.

510
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:14,920
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch out.

511
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you see that? I just chopped off your head again.

00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,540
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your head's rolling. You can't see it, your eyes are on your head.

513
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,540
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir?  What?

514
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm busy playing a video game without even looking at the screen.

515
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,170
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

516
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Old man Nebbercracker's house is possessed.

517
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,040
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to know how to destroy it before it kills people.

518
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:37,280
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calm down. You make me wanna throw up in some tinfoil and eat it.

519
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:40,080
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you like the steel of my blade? It's so cold.

520
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,460
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Possessed house, you say?

521
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,600
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In my travels to the video store and comic-book conventions...

522
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,570
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I've seen many strange and wondrous things.

523
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:58,330
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I've heard tell of man-made structures...

524
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,710
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...becoming possessed by a human soul...

525
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:05,510
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...so that the spirit becomes merged with wood and brick...

526
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,810
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...creating a rare form of monster...

527
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:13,860
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...known as Domus mactabilis.

528
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,190
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The house is Mr. Nebbercracker.

529
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,920
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're its murderous enemies.

530
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,300
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have fun getting killed.

531
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,600
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run, coward.

532
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:31,030
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that blood.

533
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how do we kill it?

534
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:37,700
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've gotta strike at the source of life: The heart.

535
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,110
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But houses don't have hearts.

536
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,910
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

537
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah.

538
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,950
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. You might be right about that.

539
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:53,860
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, children, but I've got some very important business to take care of.

540
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,530
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't be seeing you later.

541
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,850
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thou art dead.

542
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:10,040


543
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,010


544
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,710
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we need to strike at the heart.

545
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,590
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but where are we gonna find a heart inside a house?

546
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,160
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ever since Nebbercracker died...

547
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...there's been smoke coming out of that chimney.

548
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:37,170
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The furnace. The furnace is the heart.

549
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:41,370
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we wanna put out the fire, we're gonna have to go inside.

550
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,980
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Without getting chewed to pieces.

551
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,910


552
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dummy.  Hey, I was just doodling.

553
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,880
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Chowder, this is it. First, we build a dummy.

554
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,580
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We fill the dummy with a few gallons of cold medicine.

555
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:56,320
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Borrow it from your dad's pharmacy.  Say what?

556
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:59,520
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Feed the dummy to the house, house eats the medicine, goes to sleep.

557
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:02,700
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at this.  We get in, douse the fire and get out.

558
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,270
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Questions?  Yes, are you nuts?

559
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna steal drugs from my father...

560
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,140
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I don't wanna go inside a monster and I don't wanna die.

561
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:17,210
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I say it's worth a shot.  Yes, I agree, let's do it.

562
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,940


563
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:50,610
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, but I wanted that one.

564
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,080
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've gotta be kidding me.  Yes.

565
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:25,380
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chowder. Quiet.  Sorry.

566
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,260
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go.

567
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,490
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoopsie-daisy.

568
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:56,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, little vacuum-cleaner dummy, I'm gonna move you into position.

569
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,380
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't be scared.

570
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,450
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not how I trained you.

571
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,350
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you, vacuum-cleaner dummy.

572
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,350
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chowder, come on.

573
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:17,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

574
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:27,730
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

575
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,940
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trick or treat.

576
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,440
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Plug it in.

577
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,900
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So close.

578
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:29,060
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Littering, loitering, vandalism, vagrancy...

579
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:30,900
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And treason.  No, not treason.

580
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,970
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure? Because in the book...  I'm sure.

581
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, kids, out of the trash cans. Let's go.

582

00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:44,450
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, drop your weapons.

00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:46,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pass them to me. Come on.

586
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:53,560
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will shoot you.  Well, lookie we got here.

587

588
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:02,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am on it.

589

593
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,790

596
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,210
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it. That is it.

597
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:40,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got something to say, Porky, huh?

598
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,310

599

601
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,440
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, officer, you've gotta believe us.

602
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,820
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, 2-percent, you got the right to shut up.

603
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:58,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, the house is a monster.  And to think I believed you.

604
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:02,330
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, listen, I'm with you guys. My cousin's a cop in Milwaukee.

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, kind of a cop. He has a gun.

606
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:08,270
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. They're gonna love you downtown, Jughead.

607

608
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. That's why I live in a condo.

609
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:18,070
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Supercop. Super-duper-duper-cop. Super...

610
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,480
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You hear that?  That's my stomach. I'm starving.

611
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:26,350
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no. That sounds like the dangerous creature.

612
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,860
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna go check it out.  Oh, my gosh.

613
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,290
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is like trying to wrangle a puppy. All right, I'll be back.

614
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,760
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys, stop.  Hey, guys.

615
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,590
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Get out of there.  No, don't go in there.

616
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:50,180
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

617
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:56,040
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tell you. Super-roll.

618
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,210
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop. Stop.  Hey. Hey. Come on.

619
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,250
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know what's up with that house.

620
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,330
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where you at, spooky creature?

621
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,260
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna find you.

622
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:17,300
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Freeze...

623
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,130
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...tree.

624
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,780
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what you doing? You can't do that.

625
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:27,610
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not to an officer, brother. That is illegal.

626
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:32,620
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm coming, buddy.  Put me down!

627
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:36,310
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna go get backup.  I thought there was no backup.

628
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:37,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm getting Judy.

629
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,960
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Judy!

630
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,660
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help!

631
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:47,270
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mama!

632
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:54,070
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

633
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,510
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I'm having a stroke.  Just try to stay calm, okay?

634
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,510
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll be all right if we just stay calm.

635
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:15,450
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm too young to die!

636
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:27,470
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jenny. I've always loved you.

637
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,550
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chowder!  Sorry.

638
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:32,810
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mama!

639
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,250
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't look.

640
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,960
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, come on. Let's go.

641
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:29,670
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're dead. You've killed us and now we're dead.

642
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:32,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think the house knows that we're in here.

643
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,530
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I bet it thinks we're still in the car.

644
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:37,230
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen.

645
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,680
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It sounds like it's sleeping.

646
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:42,570
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only way that we're gonna get out of here alive...

647
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,340
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is if we find the heart, we put out the fire.

648
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:47,890
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we should examine our other options.

649
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:50,110
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure. Other option:

650
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:53,620
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We wait here and do nothing until it wakes up and eats us.

651
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,720
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find the heart, put out the fire. Got it.

652
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,440
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Explosives. That's so cool.

653
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,820
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was watching me.  DJ.

654
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:36,190
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you ever see a wife?

655
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,710
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People used to say he had one...

656
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:43,240
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but he fattened her up...

657
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,750
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and he ate her.

658
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:55,390
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Demolition squad."

659
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,390
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

660
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,320
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

661
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be quiet.

662
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,930
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, I have a very light step.

663
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:20,850
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There. Right there. Shoot it.

664
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:03,550
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? I thought if I shot the heart, that...

665
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,950
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not the heart.  Then what is it?

666
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,290
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if those are the teeth and that's the tongue...

667
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...then that must be the uvula.

668
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,100
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So it's a girl house.

669
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:20,240
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No.

670
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It stimulates the gag reflex. Everyone has a uvula.

671
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,410
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not me.

00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,930
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Let's move.

674
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,680
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to move quickly and quietly.

675
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,310
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't touch anything.

00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,880
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And stay together...

677
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,950
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}DJ!  Wait.

678

00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:14,090
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll save you.

680
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,740
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chowder, knock it off.

681
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,040
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. I thought you were... DJ!

00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,800
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This must be where Nebbercracker kept his stash.

00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,790

00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:15,340

00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:20,140
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe he just felt guilty or something. DJ, can we please get out of here?

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chowder.

718
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,750
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Chowder, grab on.

719
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,620
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gotcha.

720
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}DJ, look out!

721
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,270
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

722
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:52,130
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The uvula.

723
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:11,520
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}DJ...  Chowder.

724
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:13,730
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy!

725
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:29,740
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gross.

726
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:32,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did we just get upchucked?

727
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:35,410
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The uvula, nature's emergency exit.

728
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:43,080
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it. Another great idea, DJ. Brilliant.

729
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:44,720
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want from me, Chowder?

730
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,260
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't see you coming up with any big ideas.

731
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,950
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah? Yeah? Do you wanna hear my big idea?

732
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:54,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going home to make a pretzel sandwich. See you.

733
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,160
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chowder, the house is still alive and you're gonna wuss out?

734
01:00:57,370 --> 01:01:00,170
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I risked my life for you. I stole drugs for you...

735
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:02,570
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I could've died in there.  Yeah, me too.

736
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:05,400
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the one that killed Nebbercracker in the first place.

737
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:07,170
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Getting your ball back.  You guys.

738
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:09,970
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop fighting. You're acting like babies.

739
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:12,210
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are babies.

740
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,820
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What were we thinking?

741
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:16,920
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We tried to put a house to sleep with cold medicine.

742
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,060
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How lame can you get?  Where are you going?

743
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:23,060
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going home. I suck.

744
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:27,660
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}DJ.

745
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,230
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least it's an ambulance.

746
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:36,000
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}DJ?

747
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:56,690
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a ghost.

748
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:59,850
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Begone. Fie.

749
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:03,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Begone yourself. Get away.

750
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,700
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not a ghost.

751
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:09,670
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not dead. I'm not a murderer.

752
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:13,630
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course I'm not dead. Who said I was dead?

753
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:16,450
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be dead if you don't scram.

754
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:18,480
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, DJ.  Let's hurry.

755
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,090
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you know what day this is?

756
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:27,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm running out of time. I'm running out of time.

757
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,460
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey...

758
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:36,360
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...l'm home.

759
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:42,300
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, look at you, dear.

760
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,770
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your shingles are all ruffled...

761
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:49,240
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and your windows are cracked.

762
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:55,690
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, but it's no problem, sweetheart. It's no problem at all.

763
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:58,950
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's her. The house is her.

764
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,920
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}DJ, what are you doing?  Wait. Come on.

765
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:02,460
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come back.  Where you going?

766
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,390
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing paint and varnish can't handle.

767
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,930
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Nebbercracker.

768
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,830
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know about Constance.

769
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,560
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You what?

770
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,500
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you know? You don't know anything.

771
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:22,310
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were in my house? You...

772
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:28,610
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't kill her, did you?

773
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,920
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love her so much.

774
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,040


775
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:05,750
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

776
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:09,860
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay.

777
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:13,390
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can take you away from here.

778
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,400
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you like that?

779
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:20,530
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

780
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:24,170
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There we go.

781
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:26,170
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Won't be long now.

782
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,350


783
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:35,210
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

784
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,310
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, open your eyes.

785
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:44,260
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, it's not much, I know, but just...  Darling.

786
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,630
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get away from my house!

787
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,930
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna rip them to bits.

788
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:58,840
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help.

789
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,510
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Constance.  Help. Help.

790
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,870
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong? Are you hurt?  Hurt?

791
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:06,110
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I'm hurt. Those criminals are attacking our house.

792
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,510
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trick or treat.  Now, now...

793
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:10,720
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...they're just kids, dear.

794
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Halloween.  No, no, no.

795
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,690
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my house, and they're hurting me.

796
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:18,060
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Constance, look at me. Look at me.

797
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:23,030
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As long as I'm here, I will never let anyone hurt you.

798
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Constance.  Sucker.

799
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,260
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You vandals.

800
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:27,960
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eat this.  You hooligans.

801
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:30,640
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll get you.  Constance, no!

802
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:48,120
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I finished the house.

803
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:51,090
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She would've wanted that.

804
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,790
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She died, but she didn't leave.

805
01:05:57,170 --> 01:05:59,640


806
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,770
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that night...

807
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:06,600
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...that one night of every year...

808
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:09,010
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I had to take precautions.

809
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:10,980
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trick or treat.  I had to.

810
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:14,670
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sucker.  I had to.

811
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:20,250
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Get a...

812
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:24,050
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay away from my house!

813
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,020
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She attacks anyone who comes near.

814
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:29,430
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go.

815
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:32,190
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm coming, dear.

816
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,890
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go.

817
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:37,300
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, wait. I can't let you do this, Mr. Nebbercracker.

818
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:40,030
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that you've been protecting us all these years.

819
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,270
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now it's our turn to protect you.

820
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,540
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let her go.

821
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:50,850

01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:52,990
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...then I'll have no one.

823
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:55,490
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not true.

831
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:47,700
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move it, pork chop.

01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:52,490
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've been a bad girl, haven't you?

847
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:55,600
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've hurt people.

848

{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't.

870
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,900
{\fnCambria\fs19\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The chimney. The chimney leads to the heart.

871
