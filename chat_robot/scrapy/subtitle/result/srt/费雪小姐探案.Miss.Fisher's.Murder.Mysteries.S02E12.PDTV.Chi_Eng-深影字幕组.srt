00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,760
还以为我们会去索伦托度蜜月
Thought we might go to Sorrento for the honeymoon.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,680
在这儿钓鱼也不错 不是吗
Good fishing there, is it?

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,160
哈哈 你钓到一条! 卷上来 卷上来
Ha-hey, you got one! Reel her in, reel her in.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,520
- 哇...拉上来 - 鱼竿都要断了
- Wha... There you go. - It's gonna break!

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,080
这是什么
What is it?

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,240
- 转过去 - 休斯...
- Turn your back. - Hugh...

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,520
- 那是...- 多蒂 我叫你转过身去!
- That's... - Dottie, I said turn your back!

00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,080
费雪小姐探案集 第二季第十二集
        不自然之习惯     

9
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,080
没有失踪人口记录 先生
Nothing in the missing persons record, sir.

10
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,720
打扰一下 先生们 多蒂叫我载她来这儿
Pardon us, gentlemen. Dot asked me to drive her here.

11
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,548
多蒂 我叫你别来这儿 
Dot, I told you not to come. 

12
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,960
她是天主教徒 休斯
She's Catholic, Hugh.

13
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,850
是天主教的肩布 先生 
It's the scapular, sir. 

14
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:02,280
我不希望她看到 但是...
I don't want her to see it, but...

15
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,880
我想帮忙
I want to help.

16
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,760
多蒂可能知道哪个学校或教区有上面的箴言
Dot may know which school or parish favours whatever motto's on it.

17
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,480
好吧
Alright.

18
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,853
穿着这件肩布死去的人
'Whoever dies wearing this scapular 

19
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:21,760
可以免受永恒之火的痛苦
shall not suffer eternal fire.'

20
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,960
那背面呢
And the back?

21
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,920
救赎的标记 卡梅尔峰的圣母玛利亚
'Behold the sign of salvation.' Our Lady of Mount Carmel.

22
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,960
这说明不了什么 任何人都可能有那个
That's no help. Anybody could have that one.

23
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,080
这看起来像绳子烧伤的
These look like rope burns.

24
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,680
柯林斯发现她的时候 她被捆着
She was bound when Collins found her.

25
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,080
还有其他东西
There's something else.

26
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,000
这被缝在她的衬衫上
It was stitched into her smock.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,880
名字被洗掉了 但是... 有一个宗教徽章
The name's been washed off, but... there's a religious emblem.

28
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,320
那是妓女收容所的洗衣标记
That's the Magdalene laundry mark,

29
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,520
是圣奇迹姐妹修道院的
from the Convent of the Sisters of the Holy Miracle.

30
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,560
- 你确定吗 - 是的
- Are you sure? Yes.

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,000
那些堕落的无依无靠的姑娘为我们洗衣服
The fallen and friendless girls do our laundry.

32
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,520
阿流苏斯修女 我是罗宾森警探
Mother Aloysius. Inspector Robinson.

33
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,480
我想 主教已告知你我的来访 
The... Bishop has cleared my visit with you, I take it.

34
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,320
他没说你会带一个同伴来
He didn't say anything about you bringing a companion.

35
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,320
尊敬的芬乐妮·费雪小姐
The Honourable Miss Phryne Fisher.

36
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,320
费雪小姐是一个女侦探
Miss Fisher is a lady detective.

37
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,840
是啊 不幸的是
Yes. Well, unfortunately,

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,760
南城警方还没有任用女警
City South Police have yet to appoint any policewomen.

39
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,840
谢天谢地 我很高兴能这样工作
Thankfully, I'm happy to serve that function.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,560
那样的话 我想主教就会同意了
In that case, I'm sure the Bishop will approve.

41
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,280
女警
Policewoman?

42
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,800
别担心 杰克 我永远不会穿上警服的
Don't worry, Jack. You'll never get me in that uniform.

43
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,400
当然 除非你逼我
Unless, of course, you cuff me.

44
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,960
修女! 修女 我们确认过了
Mother! Mother, we've confirmed.

45
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
凯瑟琳要去给一个卖女帽的当学徒
Catherine is to be apprenticed to a milliner.

46
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,720
什么...现在...
Oh! What... now...

47
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,920
如果你的针线活和我想得一样好
If your needlepoint is anywhere near as good as I think it is,

48
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,840
你一定会很成功的
you're going to be a great success.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,120
去门口等吧 凯瑟琳 出租车一会儿就到 
Wait by the gate, Catherine. The cab will arrive presently.

50
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,680
警察是来调查伯纳黛特失踪的事的
The police are here about Bernadette's disappearance.

51
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,920
波普塔 是监督姑娘们的项目的
Perpetua, who oversees all our programs with the girls.

52
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,480
这是多米尼加修女
And Sister Dominica.

53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,438
我们没洗过你的衣服吗 
Don't we do your laundry? 

54
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,160
洗过 事实上
You do, indeed.

55
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,880
洗得非常好
To absolute perfection.

56
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,720
你们知道伯纳黛特的全名吗
Do you know Bernadette's full name?

57
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,600
不知道
I'm afraid we don't.

58
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,640
几年前她来找我们的时候是个孤儿
She came to us as an orphan some years ago now,

59
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,000
我们以圣灵的名义给她取名
and we named her for the saint.

60
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,000
- 你说她失踪了 - 是的
- You said she's gone missing. - Yes.

61
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,960
不久前她被安排在联邦酒店工作
She was placed in employment at the Federal Hotel some time ago,

62
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,960
但是昨晚她回来了 精神不太正常
but she returned to us late last night in a state.

63
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,440
为什么呢
About what?

64
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,400
她觉得做厨房帮工有失了她的身份
She was of the opinion hotel kitchen hand was beneath her.

65
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,640
非常激动 我无法安抚她 就哄她睡觉
Hysterical. I couldn't calm her. I put her to bed.

66
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,600
但是早上她就走了 再一次
But by morning she was gone. Again.

67
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,260
你们有谁见过这个吗 
Are any of you familiar with this? 

68
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:10,761
我们怀疑这可能是伯纳黛特的
We suspect it could be Bernadette's.

69
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,000
我们今天早晨从河里捞到了她的尸体
I'm afraid we fished her body out of the river this morning.

70
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,280
看起来她的死并不是意外
And it appears her death wasn't an accident.

71
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,880
我的上帝!
Oh... dear God!

72
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,880
我会带你们去洗衣房
I'll take you through the laundry.

73
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,120
那晚我就让她待在这里
This is where I put her for the night.

74
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,480
为什么不是宿舍
Not in the dormitory?

75
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,240
都过了十二点了 她可能会吵醒别的姑娘的
It was past midnight. She would've unsettled the other girls.

76
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,320
我们叫它忏悔室
We call it the Penitence Room.

77
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,880
可以回去工作了 去接安格斯轧布机的活
Back to work now. You'll take over from Agnes on the mangle.

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,360
我最爱的工作
My favourite job.

79
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,120
记得乞求主原谅你
And remember to beg our Lord's forgiveness

80
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,880
这恶劣又不知好歹的态度
for your wicked, ungrateful attitude.

81
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,680
我那样做 你觉得他会付我们薪水吗
If I do that, do you think he'll start paying us wages?

82
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,120
艾达 快去
Ada, go.

83
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,160
我叫玛丽
My name is Mary.

84
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,960
你连亲圣母玛利亚的脚都不配
You ain't fit to kiss the Holy Mother's feet,

85
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,520
更别说和她同名了
let alone share her name.

86
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,360
你是说这些女孩都是没有薪水的吗
Do you mean to tell me these girls aren't paid?

87
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,160
我们蒙受神的祝福住在主的房子里 费雪小姐
We're blessed to live in the Lord's house, Miss Fisher.

88
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,680
这里没有人拿薪水的
No-one gets paid here.

89
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,720
妓女收容所洗衣房是不受劳动法约束的
The Magdalene Laundries are exempt from usual labour laws.

90
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,080
你能让这地方再悲惨一点吗
Do you think you could make it any less harrowing?

91
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,080
这里简直是大卫科波菲尔里的场景
This place is straight out of the pages of David Copperfield.

92
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,160
伯纳黛特是怎么出去的
How did Bernadette get out of here?

93
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,480
- 那些从窗户上挂下来 - 另一边是什么
- Those were hanging from the window. - What's on the other side?

94
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,400
正巧是河岸 非常凑巧
The riverbank, as it happens. It's quite a drop.

95
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,200
可能她不小心滑入河中
Perhaps she slipped and fell.

96
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,099
我要和姑娘们一个一个单独聊聊 
I'll need to talk to the girls one by one. 

97
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,640
当然
Of course.

98
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,840
但是... 你的女警最好在外面等
Though... we'd prefer your policewoman wait outside.

99
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,720
我更希望她在场
I would prefer her presence.

100
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,360
姑娘们很感激我们提供的庇护所 警探
The girls are grateful for the shelter we provide, Inspector.

101
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,480
我们不想因为聊到工人的权利
We don't want to stir up dissatisfaction

102
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,200
和规则而引发她们的不满
with the talk of workers' rights and regulations.

103
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,680
我确定你们不想
I'm sure you don't.

104
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,120
我们这儿不是一个工厂 我们是一个大家庭
We're not a factory here. We're a family.

105
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,640
那如果费雪小姐不发表她的意见的话...
If Miss Fisher keeps her opinions to herself...

106
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,000
没关系 杰克 比起干这个我更愿意走
It's alright, Jack. I'd rather leave than do that.

107
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,960
我还有其他线索要调查 还要找个新的洗衣工
I do have other leads to follow. And a new launderer to find.

108
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,960
看...好了
And... voila.

109
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,120
这些床单之间系的是平结
These sheets were tied with thief knots.

110
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
根本无法承受一个年轻姑娘的重量
They'd never bear the weight of a young girl.

111
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,380
我确实知道怎么打结 费雪小姐 
Hm. I do know my knots, Miss Fisher. 

112
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:12,360
我很好奇你是怎么知道的
I'm curious as to how you do.

113
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,440
我以前认识一个葡萄牙海员
There was this Portuguese sailor I once knew.

114
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,920
别...说了
Don't... Enough.

115
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,920
所以是有人准备了绳子来掩饰伯纳黛特的逃跑
So somebody prepared the rope to explain Bernadette's escape.

116
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,400
谁会那么做呢
Who would need to do that?

117
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,120
那个放她走的人 姑娘们中的一个
Whoever let her out. One of the girls?

118
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,600
她们不会来了
They're hardly forthcoming.

119
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,800
你以为呢 她们生活在忏悔室的恐惧之下
Well, what do you expect? They live in fear of the Penitence Room.

120
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,742
我爸爸曾经把我锁在碗柜里 
My father used to lock me in a cupboard to 

121
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:31,840
试图摧毁我的意志
try and break my spirit.

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,960
显然关得不够久啊 那波普塔呢
Clearly didn't leave you there long enough. What about Perpetua?

123
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,960
或者是修女中的一个
Or one of the nuns.

124
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,280
我无法想象她们会帮伯纳黛特
I can't imagine them doing Bernadette a favour.

125
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,000
- 你...折了它 - 过来
- Oh, you've... you've creased it now. - Oh, come here.

126
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,720
杰克 费雪小姐
Jack. Miss Fisher.

127
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,000
你们俩这些天走得很近啊
You do indeed keep close company these days.

128
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,120
我正要走
I was just on my way out.

129
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,920
我接到一个麻烦的电话 主教非常生气
I received a disturbing telephone call from a very irate bishop.

130
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,920
和天主教会相处我们得非常小心 杰克
We need to tread very carefully with the Catholic Church, Jack.

131
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,080
你知道的
You know that.

132
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,280
似乎太过小心了吧
A little too carefully, it seems.

133
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,320
如果那个洗衣房不是开在修道院
If that laundry was run outside of the convent,

134
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,800
它就违反了儿童保护法
it would be in breach of child cruelty laws.

135
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,840
教会对更高的法律负责 我们必须得尊重它
The Church answers to a higher law, and we're obliged to respect that.

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
这就是为什么你要把这个案子
Which is why you're handing the investigation

137
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,160
交接给警探欧·谢贺尼斯去调查
over to Detective Inspector O'Shaughnessy.

138
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,160
欧·谢贺尼斯没这个能力
O'Shaughnessy is an incompetent!

139
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,160
欧·谢贺尼斯也许没你有能力 杰克
O'Shaughnessy may not be up to your standards, Jack.

140
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,480
但是他是天主教徒 这是很好的优势
But he has the distinct advantage of being Catholic.

141
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,360
这现在是他的案子了 行政长官的指令
It is now his case, by order of the Chief Commissioner.

142
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,880
那好吧 我...我要跟他谈谈
Well, then I... I... I need to speak with him.

143
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,320
行政长官豪尔今天早晨辞职了
Chief Commissioner Hall resigned this morning.

144
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,520
那谁来代替他呢
Well, who's his replacement?

145
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,200
- 你正看着他呢 - 恭喜你
- You're looking at him. Congratulations.

146
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,640
今天是我上任的第一天 别跟我添难处
It's my first day on the job. Don't make it any more difficult.

147
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,320
乔治·桑德森真的相信一个
Does George Sanderson really believe that a man

148
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,040
名字前有欧的男人
with an O in front of his name

149
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,960
会控告一群修女吗
will bring charges against a pack of nuns?

150
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,440
别管了 费雪小姐
Leave it alone, Miss Fisher.

151
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,920
我们这么辛苦为那些修女找工作
We worked so hard to find jobs for those convent girls.

152
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,880
那些心怀感激的姑娘
The Gratitude girls were not the ones 

153
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:35,280
不是我们从泥潭里救出来的
we plucked out from the gutter.

154
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,760
只有最规矩的会被选中
Only the best behaved were chosen.

155
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,640
什么 那剩下的注定成为奴隶
What, and the rest were doomed to slavery

156
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,600
待在那满是肥皂沫的可怕的洗衣房里
amongst the suds of that hideous laundry?

157
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,000
坏姑娘 好床单 拿不到一分钱
Bad girls, good sheets and not a penny in wages.

158
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,800
如果我没遇到你 就会去修道院 小姐
I would've turned to the convent if I hadn't met you, Miss.

159
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,480
她们没有选择
They have no choice.

160
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,680
更正当的理由不去剥削她们
All the more reason not to exploit them.

161
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,880
为了你的好姑娘们 普顿斯阿姨
As for your 'good' girls, Aunt Prudence,

162
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,360
你要告诉我有两个女孩失踪了吗
are you telling me that two of them have gone missing?

163
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,040
乔安不是失踪 她逃跑了
Joan did not go missing, she absconded.

164
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,600
在我感谢赞助人的晚宴上 她甚至不在安排中
During my Gratitude Patrons dinner. She wasn't even part of the program.

165
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,897
但是我给了她一个机会 
But I gave her a chance, 

166
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:08,840
在我家一个不错的职位
a plum placement in my very own household.

167
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
伯纳黛特也有一个不错的职位 在联邦酒店
Bernadette had a plum placement too, at the Federal Hotel.

168
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,000
我们的董事都有不错的人脉
Oh, all of our board are well connected.

169
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,720
沃思顿家家族 康普顿家家族 弗莱彻家家族
The Worthingtons, the Comptons, the Fletchers,

170
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,200
我们尽其所能
and we all do what we can.

171
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,420
弗莱彻是悉尼的弗莱彻吗 
Fletcher as in Sidney Fletcher? 

172
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:24,040
是的 最年长的那个
Yes, their eldest.

173
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,800
他是乔治·桑德森的教子 警察局副局长
He's godson of George Sanderson, deputy police commissioner.

174
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,920
杰克前妻萝丝的未婚夫 
And fiance to Jack's ex-wife, Rosie.

175
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,120
你很善于用迂回的方式看待事情 亲爱的
You have a very roundabout way of looking at things, dear.

176
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,760
是的
Ah. Yes.

177
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,640
这就是乔安
There's Joan.

178
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,320
乔安 她看起来不像是会逃跑的人
Joan? She didn't seem the runaway type.

179
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,920
她做的麦片粥很棒
She made a wonderful flummery.

180
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,280
连那些带瓶塞的玻璃杯
Not even those bottle-top glasses

181
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,560
也无法拯救我的皇家阿尔伯特茶具
could save my Royal Albert tea set from ruin.

182
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,849
早上好 修女 
Morning, Sister. 

183
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,440
荣耀的费雪小姐洗衣房 一如既往
The Honourable Miss Fisher's laundry, as per usual.

184
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,840
今天都星期三了 一如既往 应该是周一
Today's Wednesday. As per usual, it's Monday.

185
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,320
八套段子床单 十八套内衣裤 
8 sets of satin sheets, 18 pairs of smalls, 

186
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:44,720
十二件女士背心
12 camisoles?

187
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,480
- 有客人留宿  - 是那个女人
- House guests. - That woman!

188
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,760
- 搬到后面去 - 主保佑你 修女
- Put it round the back. - Bless you, Sister.

189
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,720
不要太大声 他们在晨祷
Keep the noise down. They're at morning prayers.

190
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
没人
All clear.

191
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,102
做圣职本来是简单的选择 
Taking holy orders would've been the easier option. 

192
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:13,680
你们居然称之为开车
You call that driving?

193
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,440
如果你喜欢 我很乐意换辆车
Happy to swap cars if you like.

194
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,480
你准备怎么出去
How will you get out?

195
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,480
一个小时后 我们在前门见
Meet you out the front in an hour.

196
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,440
给我三个不应该在这大叫的理由
Give me three good reasons why I shouldn't scream the place down.

197
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,560
给我三个你应该大叫的理由
Give me three good reasons why you should.

198
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,960
为什么昨天波普塔叫你艾达?
Why did Perpetua call you Ada yesterday?

199
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,200
所有来这的人都得改名字 为了神圣
They change everybody's name when you get here, to saints.

200
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,027
为什么圣艾达这么出名 
What was Saint Ada's claim to fame? 

201
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:49,120
她是一个被献祭的处女
She was a dedicated virgin.

202
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,120
真是后无来者
Hard act to follow.

203
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,960
这是工厂领班的主意 不是我
This was the factory foreman's idea. Not mine.

204
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,320
你知道我并不是警察 玛丽
You know I'm not the police, Mary.

205
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,280
伯纳黛特回来的那晚 你见到她了么?
Did you see Bernadette the night she came back?

206
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,200
因为她的原因我才得以缓刑
I was reprieved on her account.

207
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,200
那是一个月以来我第一次住进宿舍
It was the first time in a month I got to sleep in the dorm.

208
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,680
她像个孩子一样哭闹
She was bawling like a baby

209
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,440
并且乞求波普塔不要让他找到她
and begging Perpetua not to let him get her.

210
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,440
谁?
Who?

211
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,600
她提到了一个外面旅店的男人
She said something about a man outside the hotel, um...

212
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,960
还总是说到一辆车 一辆昂贵的黑色小轿车
And she was going on about a car. A fancy black car.

213
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,560
- 她提到了乔安 - 乔安?
- And she was talking about Joan. - Joan?

214
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,920
我们叫她四眼 是修女的走狗
We called her Four Eyes. The nuns' pet.

215
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,787
她和伯纳黛特曾经是最好的朋友 
She and Bernadette were best friends 

216
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:35,040
直到他们不再让乔安工作
until they sent Joan off to work

217
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,280
而是被一个有钱的老悍妇看中了她做饭的才能
for some rich old battleaxe who took a shine to her cooking.

218
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,070
伯纳黛特是不是会间歇性的发狂? 
Was Bernadette prone to hysterics? 

219
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:46,240
我不太了解她
I hardly knew her.

220
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,880
他们让好女孩远离我们这些坏蛋
They kept the good girls away from us bad eggs.

221
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,600
但是她留下了信息
But she left a message.

222
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,160
我今天早上才在那看到
I only saw it there this morning.

223
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
'一一二 德·威赫'
'112 De Vere.'

224
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,480
-  这是划上去的 - 用这些
- This has been scratched in. - With these.

225
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
乔安的
Joan's.

226
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,320
早上好 柯林斯
Good morning, Collins.

227
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,000
长官 这是伯纳黛特的验尸报告
Sir, the... the autopsy report on Bernadette.

228
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,800
把它给 欧·谢贺尼斯 他现在负责这个案子
Um... Give it to O'Shaughnessy. He's in charge of this case now.

229
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,680
- 但是 但是  - 直接送去 柯林斯
- But... but... - Immediately, Collins.

230
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,400
我也送弗莱彻先生去欧·谢贺尼斯么 长官?
Shall I send Mr Fletcher to O'Shaughnessy too, sir?

231
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,760
你昨天给他打过电话 让他过来的
You telephoned him yesterday, asked him to come in.

232
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,880
- 他和您的妻子 您的前妻 前妻
- He and your wife... your ex-wife. Ex-wife.

233
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,360
是的 柯林斯
Y-yes, Collins.

234
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,400
我还得这样说多少次啊
How many times do I have to say that?

235
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,560
所以 你是为什么被关在那
So, why were you locked in there?

236
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,200
这次?
This time?

237
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,080
我把糖换成泻药放在了修女的木薯粉布丁里面
I put Epsom salts instead of sugar in the sisters' tapioca pudding.

238
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,000
她们整晚都在去厕所
They were up all night with the shits...

239
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,240
我向你保证 我会亲自重新指派这个案子
I assure you, I have personally reassigned the case.

240
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,360
情况不会再继续恶化了
There will be no more aggravation.

241
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,680
专员 波普塔 多么出色的风干方式 是吧?
Commissioner. Perpetua. Excellent drying weather, wouldn't you say?

242
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,960
- 你闯入了修道院 - 不 当然不是
- You broke into the convent. - No, of course not.

243
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,440
我是溜进去的
I was smuggled.

244
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,880
我以为这种轻浮的社会人会睡到中午
I thought these dilettante society types slept till noon.

245
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,260
非法入侵 打破并且侵占 
Unlawful trespass, break and entry. 

246
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,480
我希望这个女人能乖乖就范
I want this woman brought to heel.

247
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,400
你是不是想让我也洗衣服去?
Would you like me to roll over and fetch too?

248
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,640
你似乎对她有些动摇
You seem to have some sway over her.

249
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,120
萝丝 西德尼 你们怎么来了?
Rosie, Sidney, what are you doing here?

250
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,400
我们是被传唤的 至少西德尼是这样
We were summoned. Well, at least Sidney was.

251
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,680
我们过来看看能否帮帮那个可怜的修道院女孩
We've come to see if we can help with that poor convent girl.

252
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,600
作为感恩会的一名董事
And as a member of the Gratitude board.

253
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,040
我的阿姨告诉过我
So my aunt tells me.

254
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,760
我 忘记取消这次会面
I... forgot to cancel the appointment.

255
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,965
父亲 我知道你让杰克不再
Father, I believe you've taken 

256
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:05,840
插手这个案子 为什么?
Jack off this case.Why?

257
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,320
这是外交问题 亲爱的 杰克明白
It's a diplomacy issue, my dear. Jack understands.

258
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,920
这不是你该担心的问题
It's nothing for you to worry about.

259
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,200
是的 是的 是的
No, no, no.

260
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,720
但是 如果你不把费雪跟的这么紧
But... if you don't keep Miss Fisher under a tighter rein,

261
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,000
你会发现你几乎停下了所有的工作
you may find yourself suspended from all duties.

262
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,880
再见 费雪小姐
Goodbye, Miss Fisher.

263
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,200
杰克 对不起
Jack, I'm sorry.

264
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,680
拜托告诉我你的非法入侵是值得付出这一切
Please tell me your break-in was worth all this... fuss.

265
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,960
你来判断吧
You tell me.

266
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,000
玛丽在忏悔屋里发现了这个
Mary found these in the Penitence Room

267
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,320
就在伯纳黛特失踪的第二天
the day after Bernadette did her disappearing act.

268
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,160
乔安的 普顿斯阿姨的那个发疯的女仆
Joan's. Aunt Prudence's runaway maid.

269
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,640
仅仅 根据玛丽所说
Only, according to Mary,

270
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,440
乔安是个好女孩 从来没有进过忏悔屋
Joan was a good girl and never did time in the Penitence Room.

271
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,520
那它是怎么到那的?
How'd they get there?

272
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,360
伯纳黛特回修道院的时候带在身上的
Bernadette had them with her when she returned to the convent,

273
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,880
然后她用这幅眼镜在墙上划出了这个
and she used the glass to scratch this into the wall.

274
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,840
- 一一二 德·威赫- 是个地址?
- 112 De Vere. - An address?

275
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,960
也许 是她提到的那个男人的地址
Possibly. Of the man she referred to.

276
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,200
为什么划在墙上? 为什么不告诉修女
Why scratch it into a wall? Why not tell the nuns?

277
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,989
根据玛丽所说 她试过 但是 
Well, according to Mary, she tried. 

278
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,680
也许她们没有听进去
But... perhaps they didn't listen.

279
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,960
柯林斯!
Collins!

280
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,120
我真的非常抱歉 杰克
I really am very sorry, Jack,

281
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,680
因为我 你这浑水趟的太深了
that you're in so much hot water because of me.

282
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,920
别这么悔恨 那会让我误解的 
Don't be remorseful. It only confuses me.

283
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,480
柯林斯当我跟你说
Collins, when I told you

284
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,920
把验尸报告直接送走 我
to send on that autopsy report immediately, I...

285
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,365
我还没来得及处理这个 长官 
Hardly had time to get on to it, sir. 

286
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:41,080
谢谢你
Thank you.

287
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,640
毕竟它是寄给我的
It is addressed to me after all.

288
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,680
谢天谢地 我可不想把你想成不服从命令的人
Thank goodness. I'd hate to think you were disobeying a directive.

289
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,520
所以 被害者是先死亡的 还是溺水而死的
So, was the victim already dead or did she drown in the river, sir?

290
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,720
杰克?
Jack?

291
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,640
溺水而死的 柯林斯
Drowned, Collins.

292
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,960
休斯不可能因把她钓起来而高兴
Can't have been pleasant for Hugh to fish her out of the water.

293
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,440
溺水超过一夜 头发下面发现了伤口
'In the water overnight, injury found under the hair,

294
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,440
应该是被钝器所伤
most likely caused by a blunt instrument.'

295
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,480
- 但那并不致命 - 是的
- But not the cause of death. - No.

296
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,960
肺部有很多海水
There was sea water in the lungs,

297
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,537
值得注意的是成分分析表中
notable for an exceptionally 

298
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,600
盐分的含量异常的高
high saline content.

299
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,280
然后尸体就无法从修道院顺流而下
Then the body can't have come downstream from the convent.

300
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,040
那应该是被上游海湾的水冲刷的
It must have been washed upstream from the bay!

301
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,880
还要更远
Much further than that.

302
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,040
肺部还有红藻的痕迹
The lungs also contain traces of red algae,

303
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,080
那是在亚拉河以及菲利普港湾都找不到的品种
a type that is not found in either the River Yarra or Port Phillip Bay.

304
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,360
这是休斯和多蒂发现女孩的地方
Here's where Hugh and Dottie found the girl.

305
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,800
暖河 为什么叫这个名字?
The Warmies? Why do they call it that?

306
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,510
因为那里的水是温暖的 
Because the water's warm, 

307
00:19:47,511 --> 00:19:48,920
因为那里有一个发电站
on account of the power station here.

308
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,200
潮汐从这进出
Tide comes in, tide goes out.

309
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,080
只要海湾或者河流里有干扰物都会被抓住
Anything bobbing about in the bay or the river can get caught up.

310
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,640
那怎么解释伯纳黛特肺部的盐水呢?
How do you explain the salt water in Bernadette's lungs?

311
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,880
码头有许多外籍船只
Some foreign ship in dock

312
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,400
在离她喝酒的很近的地方倾倒压舱物 
was dumping ballast near where she went into the drink?

313
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,458
是什么方法 让她在离开修道院以后 
Somehow, after leaving the convent, 

314
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:02,240
让她到达了码头
she winds up in the docks,

315
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,720
在那她被扔到海里喂鲨鱼 然后被冲回上游
where she's fed to the sharks and washes upriver.

316
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,160
- 你有没有什么想法? - 还没
- That make any sense to you? - Not yet.

317
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,840
- 如果我们知道船是从哪里来的 - 红海
- If we knew where the ship was from... - The Red Sea.

318
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,800
这里说了 那里的海水有异常高的含盐量
It says here, it has an exceptionally high salinity,

319
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,560
看上去是红色则是因为一种特殊的藻类
and the reason it looks red is because of some special algae.

320
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,200
我们能找到谁在港湾? 西西侄女的丈夫知道
Can we find out who's in port? Cec's niece's husband will know.

321
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,880
打扰一下 费雪小姐
Excuse me, Miss Fisher.

322
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,320
有一位年轻的女士想要见你
There's a young lady here demanding to see you.

323
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,480
- 你的开锁器 谢谢 这是个奖励
- Your lock pick. Thank you. It worked a treat.

324
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,078
你这样影响不好 费雪小姐 
You're a bad influence, Miss Fisher. 

325
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,480
而且你留不住她的
And, no, you can't keep her.

326
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,920
她叫玛丽 我已经确定不会送她回洗衣房
Her is Mary. And I certainly won't send her back to that laundry.

327
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,240
她明显不适合繁重的体力劳动
She is clearly unfit for heavy duties

328
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,200
我只想找份工作 什么工作都行
All I want is a job, any job.

329
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,080
但是谁会顾我这种情况的女孩
But who's going to take in a girl in my condition?

330
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,640
不行 绝对不行
No. Absolutely not.

331
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,224
但是你喜欢挑战 普顿斯 阿姨 
But you love a challenge, Aunt Prudence. 

332
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,840
你是那么的皮革马利翁
Your very own Pygmalion.

333
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,680
百香果子冻 我就知道
Passionfruit flummery, I should've known.

334
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,920
玛丽自己做的
Mary made it herself.

335
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,920
他们说仁爱始于家 
They do say charity begins at home. 

336
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:24,840
真要这样么 芬乐妮
Honestly, Phryne!

337
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,840
我位列十三名董事之中
I sit on 13 boards,

338
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,280
我大部分的生命都在花钱买有价值的东西
I spend most of my life raising money for worthy causes.

339
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,800
你不认为我已经做的够多了么?
Don't you think I do enough?

340
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,800
怎么了 波特?
What is it, Bert?

341
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,480
我们在港长的办公室遇到了障碍
We struck a snag at the harbourmaster's office.

342
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,440
西西侄子的丈夫再也不会给家人行方便
Cec's niece's husband doesn't do family favours anymore.

343
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,520
要想得到那艘船的名字得花点钱
Getting that ship's name is going to cost.

344
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,320
他在哪?
Where is he?

345
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,040
他十分的唠叨 老泰德 只要你能让他开口
He's a chatty one, old Ted. Once you loosen his tongue.

346
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,880
我想十磅足够让他开口了
Oh! Well, I think £10 has loosened it too much.

347
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,240
下次我要种喇叭花是 我会问问您的建议的
Next time I'm planting petunias, I'll ask your advice.

348
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,000
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you, thank you.

349
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,254
抱歉 长官 
Sorry, sir. 

350
00:22:13,255 --> 00:22:16,600
德·威赫·克里斯森特是香农的苗圃
De Vere Crescent is Shannon's Nursery.

351
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,600
他妈的
Damn!

352
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,520
- 也许是个名字 - 那数字又是什么?
- Maybe it's a name. - Then what are the numbers?

353
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,124
邮政信箱 登记号码? 
Post office box, motor registration? 

354
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,680
德·威赫听上去像是外国的
De Vere sounds foreign.

355
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
她是一个商用船叫做潘达斯
She's a merchant ship called the Pandarus,

356
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,520
往返于安特卫普和墨尔本通过红海
on a run between Antwerp and Melbourne via the Red Sea.

357
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,760
船长是比利时人 一个叫威廉姆·德·威赫的
Captain's Belgian. One William De Vere.

358
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,280
一一二
112!

359
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,440
昂贵的黑色轿车
A fancy black car.

360
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,880
看上去像是我们的船长
Looks like our captain.

361
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,480
泰德说她在那停了几周了
Ted says she docked three weeks ago,

362
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,400
可是她下一周就又要起航了
but she's due to sail out in another week.

363
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,480
运什么是的? 货单上写的是 白糖
What's she carrying? According to the manifest, sugar.

364
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,600
易于掩盖些不好的东西
Could be a cover for something dodgy.

365
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,320
那我们最好想个办法上船找找看
Then we better find a way to get on board and find out.

366
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,480
伙计
Mate!

367
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,400
没错 搁浅怎么样了?
Yeah, what about the bilge?

368
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,760
不要打开舱门
But keep that hatch  closed!

369
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,120
- 德·威赫船长 - 又怎么了?
- Captain De Vere. - What now?

370
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,960
- 又沉下去了 - 那就修好它
- down again. - Well, fix it.

371
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,480
拖延的已经够久了 我希望能重新赶上进度
There's been enough delays. I want us back on schedule.

372
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,481
我们确信它坏掉了 
We think it's broken. 

373
00:26:02,482 --> 00:26:05,080
你们就不能做好一件事吗?
Can't you do anything right?

374
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,760
像伯纳黛特这样的修道院好女孩
So, how did a good convent girl like Bernadette

375
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,480
怎么会出现在这个德·威赫船长的船舱里呢?
come to be in the cabin of this Captain De Vere?

376
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,880
为何他想把她从联邦酒店中诱拐出来呢?
And why did he try to abduct her from the Federal Hotel?

377
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,680
如果真是他的话
If it was him.

378
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,560
但并没有一辆登记在德·威赫名下的
There's no car...big, black or otherwise

379
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,680
黑色大轿车或者其他车
registered in the name of De Vere.

380
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,200
因为他是比利时人 那车一定是他同谋所有
Well, he's Belgian. Must belong to an accomplice.

381
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,440
- 车什么型号 - 凯迪拉克
- What kind of car was it? - A Cadillac.

382
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,160
通常 我会把这案子交给乔治处理
Under normal circumstances, I'd take this to George.

383
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,320
就是桑德森专员
Well, Commissioner Sanderson.

384
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,640
但你现在自身难保 工作都快丢了
But you're already perilously close to being out of a job.

385
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,080
你不觉得现在别跟他对着干才是明智之举吗
You don't think it's wise to antagonise him any further?

386
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,760
你警察的身份对我的帮助大得多了 杰克
You're much more use to me if you remain a policeman, Jack.

387
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,520
但我这个警察没法把任何人带进局子问询
A policeman who can't bring anyone into the station for questioning.

388
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,200
我无意冒犯 但在我的会客厅问询更舒适
No offence, but my parlour is much more comfortable.

389
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,700
为什么一个修道院女孩会出现
Why would a Gratitude girl be in 

390
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:27,680
在一个比利时船长的船舱里?
the cabin of a Belgian sea captain?

391
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,600
我们现在只能猜测 
We can only speculate at the moment. 

392
00:27:29,601 --> 00:27:31,200
她会是偷渡客吗?
You think she was a stowaway?

393
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,400
有可能是
That's one possible explanation, yes.

394
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,800
她要出去看看花花世界呗
Oh. Off to see the world.

395
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,360
但那并不能解释伯纳黛特在忏悔室的墙上
But that doesn't explain why Bernadette carved the Captain's name

396
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,160
刻下船长名字的原因
into the Penitence Room wall.

397
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,040
也不能解释她手腕上绳子的绑痕
Or why her hands were bound.

398
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,200
可能因为...她是在拘留室被人发现的
Perhaps she was... discovered in the hold.

399
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,480
伯纳黛特有对修女们说过船的事情吗
Did Bernadette say anything to the nuns about a ship?

400
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,200
她知道船长的名字
Well, she knew the name of the captain.

401
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,160
所以他们一定有交集 还有别的信息吗?
So their paths must have crossed. Any more than that?

402
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,240
只知道这么多
We don't know.

403
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,480
不管伯纳黛特身上发生了什么事 我们要想想
Whatever happened to Bernadette, we... we need to consider...

404
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,240
乔安会不会也是这么不见的
..Joan may have gone the same way.

405
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,280
你觉得她们是一起逃走的?
You think they ran away together?

406
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,520
可能我对乔安说话有点太严厉了
Perhaps I was a little too snappy with Joan.

407
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,880
但她需要学习啊
But she needed to learn.

408
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,880
还有其他的女孩
Do you know if any other girls went missing

409
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,360
从修道院逃走吗?
from their Gratitude placements?

410
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,280
杰克 你不觉得你应该
Jack, don't you think you should

411
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,560
把这些线索都告诉爸爸吗?
pass all this information on to Father?

412
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,177
你觉得那样好吗? 
Do you think that's wise? 

413
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:24,120
他都不让杰克参与这个案子
Considering he took Jack off the case?

414
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,080
他别无选择 主教死死盯着他呢
He didn't have a choice, the Bishop was breathing down his neck.

415
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,720
你在这边横加干涉 一点忙也帮不上
And your constant meddling hasn't helped.

416
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,400
亲爱的 杰克是对的
Darling, Jack's right.

417
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,120
乔治是新的行政专员
As the new chief commissioner,

418
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,800
比起杰克 他受到的限制更大
George's hands are even more tightly bound than Jack's.

419
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,680
我给你修道院劳务人员的名单
I'll get you a list of the Gratitude employers.

420
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,380
通讯簿在我车里 
My address book's out in the car. 

421
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:44,000
太好了 我会把它转交给 柯林斯
Good. I'll get them on to Collins.

422
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,440
你让杰克的处境变得更糟糕了 知道吗?
You've really made things worse for Jack, you know?

423
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,000
作为一个前妻 这关心的是不是有点过分呢 
Unusually devoted, isn't she? For an ex-wife.

424
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,480
潘达斯号本应在下周起航
Pandarus was due to sail next week.

425
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,480
但是它将要在今夜出发
But it turns out she's sailing tonight.

426
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,200
航海日程表突然变更了
Sudden change in itinerary.

427
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,160
这很可疑 它现在应该已经起航了
Well, that's suspicious. She could've sailed already.

428
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,236
不 海风很大 
Nah. She won't want 

429
00:29:19,237 --> 00:29:21,200
它不会在海面平静下来之前出发的
to go through the heads until slack water.

430
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,400
也就是今夜子时左右
Tonight around midnight.

431
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,800
我要通知桑德森专员 他现在应该采取行动了
I'll inform the Commissioner. He'll have to act now.

432
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,880
你可以等桑德森采取行动 但我不会静观其变
You can wait for Sanderson to act, but I'm not holding my breath.

433
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,280
等等 等等
No, wait, wait.

434
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,360
不管他是做绑架还是谋杀的生意
Whether he's trading in kidnap or murder,

435
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,240
那个船长就是个人渣
that captain's a nasty piece of work.

436
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,080
我不想让任何人靠近码头
I don't want anyone to go near the docks.

437
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,651
拜托了 费雪小姐 
Please, Miss Fisher. 

438
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:39,640
就这一次 你一定要听我的
Do what you're told just this once.

439
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,120
我会...告诉你我发现了什么
I'll... let you know what I find.

440
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,320
杰克探长说得对 这会比我想的要危险得多
The Inspector's right. It's far more dangerous than I imagined.

441
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,800
但是我全副武装 而且枪法精准
But I am well armed and an excellent shot.

442
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,968
我们不能这样做 小姐? 
We can't do anything, Miss? 

443
00:30:15,969 --> 00:30:18,120
泡壶热茶等着我就最好不过了
A thermos of tea would be lovely.

444
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,184
你怎么想呢 西西? 
What do you reckon, Cec? 

445
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:22,840
我们要"铁拳出击"吗?
Fists of steel?

446
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,640
这很冒险
Could be risky.

447
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,767
先生们 如果你们担心武器问题的话 
If weaponry is your only problem, gentlemen,

448
00:30:27,768 --> 00:30:28,640
我能帮上忙
I may be able to assist.

449
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,640
这是毛瑟C96半自动手枪
And this is the Mauser Broomhandle semi-automatic.

450
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,600
当然跟那把Mp18没法比 但也够用了
Not quite as impressive as the MP18, but so much more competent.

451
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,080
这些够用了
These should do the job.

452
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,520
- 多谢 B先生 - 乐意效劳
- Thanks, Mr B. - Happy to help.

453
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,960
你说这个已经上交了不是吗
You said that was handed in.

454
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,000
这是在潘达斯号停靠的码头发现的
Found at the docks, near the Pandarus.

455
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,320
有这个足以申请突袭搜查令了
Well, that is certainly enough for a raid warrant.

456
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,520
太好了 它就快起航了 
Good. We've only got 

457
00:31:03,521 --> 00:31:04,560
我们只有几个小时的时间
a few hours before she sails.

458
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,600
如果你给我搜查令和一些人手
If you organise the paperwork and the manpower,

459
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,320
我跟柯林斯现在就赶往码头
Collins and I can head to the docks.

460
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,600
抱歉 杰克 我很感谢你的帮助
I'm afraid not, Jack. Look, I appreciate your help.

461
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,560
但是这案子不归你管
But this is not your investigation

462
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,480
而且你现在已经越权了
and you've already overstepped the mark.

463
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,160
欧·谢贺尼斯就是个蠢货!
O'Shaughnessy's an imbecile!

464
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,200
如果船起航了 杀人凶手就被你放走了
If that ship sails, you'll be letting a murderer get away.

465
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,880
我明白欧·谢贺尼斯的无能 杰克
I'm aware of O'Shaughnessy's limitations, Jack.

466
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,480
所以我要亲自带队抓捕
That's why I'll be leading this raid myself.

467
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,680
但我现在命令你别碍事儿
But I'm ordering you to stop interfering.

468
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,641
如果你不服从的话...
If you disobey... 

469
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:35,080
我会毫不犹豫把你开掉
I won't hesitate to dismiss you.

470
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,960
医生说现在去分娩室已经太迟了
The doctor says it's too late to go to the lying-in home.

471
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,560
他很快就会赶来
He'll get here as soon as he can.

472
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,440
不 我不需要医生 现在还不是时候!
No! I don't need a doctor! It's not my time!

473
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,880
抓紧我
Hold on to me.

474
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,080
哦 亲爱的
Oh, dear.

475
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,560
我现在就去烧水 给剪刀消毒
I'll boil up some water and get the scissors sterilised.

476
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,800
拿一些毛巾过来 巴特勒先生 需要很多毛巾
And bring some towels, Mr Butler. Loads of towels.

477
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,594
不不不 什么也别拿过来! 
No, no, no! Don't bring anything! 

478
00:32:13,595 --> 00:32:14,600
现在还不是时候!
It's not my time!

479
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,480
别胡说 姑娘
Nonsense, girl.

480
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,640
保佑我吧 神父 我是个有罪之人
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

481
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,240
我以前做过坏事
I've been bad and wicked

482
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,320
上帝会让那些修女拿走我的宝宝的!
and God is going to let the nuns take my baby away!

483
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,320
上帝不会做这种事的 不然我早就遭报应了
God will do nothing of the kind or he'll be answerable to me!

484
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,240
现在给我振作起来 姑娘 你有大事要做呢
Now pull yourself together, girl, you've got work to do.

485
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,946
"分娩"还有个意思叫"劳动"
It's not called 'labour' 

486
00:32:30,947 --> 00:32:31,720
不是毫无缘由的
for nothing.

487
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,200
没看到黑色的车
No sign of the black car.

488
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,240
- 甲板上也没人 - 岸边看上去没有危险
- No one on deck either. - Looks like the coast is clear.

489
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,800
低下你的头 关上车门 多蒂
Keep your head down and the doors locked, Dot.

490
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,440
你知道老鼠和沉船的谚语吗[船沉鼠先逃]
You know what they say about rats and sinking ships.

491
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,040
也许德·威赫接到了警告
Maybe De Vere's been warned.

492
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,173
如果真是这样 
If he had been, 

493
00:33:41,174 --> 00:33:43,040
那潘达斯号这会已经在半路上了
the Pandarus would be halfway up to sea by now.

494
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,514
如果他们在船上藏着什么人的话 
Well, if there are holding anybody on board, 

495
00:33:45,515 --> 00:33:46,440
很难发现他们
it'll be hard to find 'em.

496
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,480
走私犯都狡猾的很
Smugglers are a crafty lot.

497
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,320
要不然我们怎么能弄到你的法国香槟
How do you think we get your French champagne into the country?

498
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,880
还有你钟爱的俄国鱼子酱?
Or that Russian caviar you're so partial to.

499
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,200
我以为你是从维多利亚市场买来的 波特
Here I was thinking you picked it up from Victoria Markets, Bert.

500
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,840
谁在那儿?
Who's there?

501
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,120
乔安
Joan!

502
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,960
费雪小姐 是你吗? 我看不清
Miss Fisher, is that you? I can't see.

503
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,160
乔安 没事了
Joan, it's alright.

504
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,840
求你了 快带我走 求你了 他就快回来了
Please, we have to leave. Please, he'll come back.

505
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,440
- 嘘 - 求你了
- Sh! Please!

506
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,240
你现在很安全 你很安全
You're safe now. You're safe now.

507
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,600
乔安
Joan.

508
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
坐这儿
Here.

509
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,920
喝了这茶 能暖和点
This tea should keep you warm.

510
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,560
给你
Here.

511
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,800
费雪小姐怎么还没出来?
What the hell's happened to Miss Fisher?

512
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,000
我希望她能在他回来之前找到其他人
I hope she finds the others before it's too late.

513
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,000
其他人? 
What others?

514
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,840
在来船上之前 他们把我跟其他人关在一起
I was locked up with the others before they brought us water.

515
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,400
然后我就逃走了
That's when I escaped.

516
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,880
我们得回去
Come on, we're going back.

517
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,640
给我下车! 快点!
Get out of car! Come here!

518
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,320
快点! 出来!
Come here! Get out!

519
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,440
哦 小可怜们
Oh, you poor lambs.

520
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,960
我想我得把你绑起来了
I'm afraid I'll have to tie you up.

521
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,560
但我觉得 你一定更喜欢被关在单独的房间吧
But I'm sure you'd prefer your own cabin anyway.

522
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,800
下来
Come down.

523
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,600
快!
Now!

524
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
柯林斯
Collins.

525
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,440
- 有突袭的消息了吗? - 没有 先生
- Any news on the raid? - No, sir.

526
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,920
不过我追踪那辆黑色轿车
But I managed to track down

527
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,760
发现了一些线索
some more details on that black motor car.

528
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,114
那辆车登记在一个公司名下 
It's registered to a company, sir. 

529
00:37:13,115 --> 00:37:15,080
叫Swf出口公司
An SWF Exports.

530
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
Swf 好耳熟 公司属谁所有?
SWF. Sounds familiar. Who owns it?

531
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,760
你在这干嘛 杰克?
What are you doing here, Jack?

532
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,960
我告诉过你 一切都在掌控之中
I told you everything was under control.

533
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,280
恐怕不是这样 你的人手呢
Doesn't look like it. Where's your manpower?

534
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,760
我会以我觉得合适的方法来处理
I will handle this any way I see fit.

535
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,400
你俩要是踏上那艘船 就别想在警局混了
You two set one foot on that ship, your jobs are finished.

536
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,196
你可以走 柯林斯
You can go, Collins. 

537
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,160
不 谢谢先生 我不走
No, thank you, sir.

538
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,120
你可以谴责我
You can reprimand me.

539
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,400
你也可以解雇我 但我就是要搜船
You can dismiss me if you like. But I am searching that ship.

540
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,840
她在哪儿
Where is she?

541
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,080
我说了别登上这艘船 杰克
I told you not to set foot on this ship, Jack.

542
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,840
乔治 你到底在隐瞒什么?
George, what the hell are you covering up?

543
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,600
我警告过你 杰克
I warned you, Jack!

544
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,000
警察 把他铐起来 把他铐在这根柱子上
Constable, handcuff him! Constable, handcuff him to this post!

545
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,920
然后把他留在这儿
And leave him there.

546
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,840
费雪小姐!
Miss Fisher!

547
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,240
芬乐妮? 费雪小姐!
Phryne? Miss Fisher!

548
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,960
费雪小姐!
Miss Fisher!

549
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,400
你在哪里
Where are you?

550
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,520
- 费雪小姐! - 杰克!
- Miss Fisher? - Jack!

551
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,440
杰克!
Jack!

552
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,360
- 费雪小姐! - 杰克!
- Miss Fisher? - Jack!

553
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,000
杰克 那些女孩被关在在前面的拘留室
Jack, the girls are locked in the front hold

554
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,480
这一切都是弗莱彻搞的鬼
and Fletcher's behind it all!

555
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,600
我们得在弗莱彻动手之前救出她们
We've got to get the girls before Fletcher does.

556
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,240
多蒂
Dottie!

557
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,440
弗莱彻!
Fletcher!

558
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,880
站住 站住
Stop! Stop!

559
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,620
我们要他钓出来吗 先生? 
Shall we fish him out, sir? 

560
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:28,600
势在必行啊
I suppose we'll have to.

561
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,160
不着急 慢慢来
Make sure you take your time.

562
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,080
多蒂 波特 西西 干得不错
Dot, Bert, Cec, well done.

563
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,000
铁拳出击 小姐 铁拳出击
Fists of steel, Miss. Fists of steel.

564
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,440
你不让我发誓言
You wouldn't let me take my vows,

565
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,120
所以我尽我所能帮教堂
so I was serving the church however I could.

566
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:16,915
以送走这些女孩的方式? 
By sending those girls away? 

567
00:42:18,323 --> 00:42:20,320
德·威赫付我十磅一人
£10 a piece De Vere paid me.

568
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,160
每一分钱我都捐出来做善事了 修女
And every penny of it went into the good works fund, Mother.

569
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,800
- 我发誓 - 一人十磅
- I swear it. - £10 a piece.

570
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,280
弗莱彻确保选中的
And Fletcher made sure

571
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,440
女孩都是白人 一袭秀发 善良贞洁
all the chosen girls were white, fair-haired and virtuous.

572
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,240
因此交易得名为"白金买卖"
What's known in the trade as White Gold.

573
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,120
你利用无辜女孩实现自己目的
You used innocent girls to further your own cause.

574
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,200
无辜?
Innocent?

575
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,480
她们都是私生女 大多数都是妓女的孩子
They were born out of wedlock, most of them, the offspring of whores.

576
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,800
她们的灵魂已经堕落
Their souls were already lost.

577
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,840
是你的灵魂堕落了 波普塔
It's your soul that's lost, Perpetua.

578
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,520
我把它落在车里了
I lost them at the back of that car.

579
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,240
伯纳黛特发现了
And Bernadette found them

580
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,480
德·威赫也想那样掳走她
when De Vere tried to abduct her the same way.

581
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,320
你的眼镜给了伯纳黛特警告
Your spectacles were Bernadette's warning...

582
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,720
让她逃
..to flee.

583
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,800
她留给我的吗
She left them for me?

584
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,720
还留下了找到你们全部人的线索
Along with the clue we needed to find you all.

585
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,520
他们为什么要杀她
Why did they kill her?

586
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,600
她已经逃出一次了 她知道的太多了
She'd already escaped once, and she knew too much.

587
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,000
船长是遵弗莱彻之命
The captain was carrying out Fletcher's orders.

588
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,240
我愿他下地狱
I hope he burns in hell!

589
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,800
弗莱彻在讨价还价
Fletcher's bargaining power.

590
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,760
有名望顾客的纪念品 城里最好的妓院
All souvenirs from the best clients, the best brothels in town.

591
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,600
盒子里可没有我的东西
There is nothing of mine in that box.

592
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,480
我想关掉妓院 他又不能勒索我
I tried to close down the brothels. He couldn't blackmail me.

593
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,920
但他可以贿赂你
But he could bribe you.

594
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,920
承诺扳倒专员豪尔
By promising to bring down Commissioner Hall with all this,

595
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,080
你可以取而代之
so you could take his place.

596
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,040
你得先证明这一切
You'll have to prove it first.

597
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,200
是的 幸运的是 我们有目击者
True. And luckily, we have a witness.

598
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,280
我阿姨感恩晚餐那晚
The night of my aunt's Gratitude dinner,

599
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,080
她的厨房女仆 乔安 碰巧听见你和
her scullery maid, Joan, overheard you and Fletcher

600
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,440
弗莱彻在阳台激烈讨论
having a heated discussion on the verandah.

601
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,960
我们知道你帮了他的忙 保护弗莱彻
We know you did him favours, protected Fletcher,

602
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,440
对他贩卖人口睁一只眼闭一只眼
turned a blind eye to his... cargo.

603
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,080
乔安本不该在那艘船上的是吗
Joan wasn't meant to be on that ship, was she?

604
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,200
她被掳走是因为听到太多
She was abducted because she'd heard too much.

605
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,880
谁会在意流浪孩的话
Who's going to believe the word of a guttersnipe?

606
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,520
再别提是针对行政专员的流言
Against that of the chief commissioner of police.

607
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,400
我阿姨普顿斯·斯坦利 碰巧很爱乔安
My aunt, Prudence Stanley, happens to be very fond of Joan.

608
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,960
她会带以最高的推荐信
So she will come with the highest references,

609
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,440
并配备最贵的律师代表团
and have the best legal representation that money can buy.

610
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,560
我崇敬过你 乔治
I looked up to you, George.

611
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,960
我尊敬过你
I respected you.

612
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,040
我不知道弗莱彻想要干嘛 萝丝 我发誓
I didn't know what Fletcher was up to, Rosie. I swear.

613
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,000
你怎么可能不知道?
How could you not know?

614
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,680
那些可怜的姑娘
Those poor girls!

615
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,200
- 求你了 求你理解我 - 你怎么能? 
- Please, please try to understand. - How could you?

616
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,280
你怎么能这样 我无法直视你
How could you? I can't look at you.

617
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,280
天啊 
Oh, God!

618
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,800
- 我很抱歉 - 别...
- (I'm sorry.) - Oh, don't...

619
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,040
杰克...
Oh, Jack...

620
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,760
不 天啊
Oh, no. Oh, God...

621
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,400
- 他们都这么红吗? - 当然
- Are they always this red? - Always.

622
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,000
可医生说这位跟小牛一样壮
But the doctor says this one is as strong as an ox.

623
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,920
对不对呀 小玩意
Aren't you, my little man?

624
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,480
太棒了
Wonderful.

625
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,120
现在我们要做的就是为玛丽找处落脚
Now all we need to do is find a placement for Mary.

626
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,840
她在我这落脚啊
She already has a placement with me.

627
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,120
当然 她康复了就能走
Once she's completely recovered, of course.

628
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,680
- 她能干吗 - 她能帮厨啊
- Doing what? - She can assist Cook.

629
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,400
我坚信假以时日 她做的汤
I've no doubt that her soup will come up to scratch

630
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,120
一定会有味道的
once she's had a bit of practice.

631
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,880
- 她的蛋奶甜点心呢? - 其实挺不错的
- And her flummery? - Quite good, actually.

632
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,240
没事的 斯坦利太太 我能接手
It's alright, Mrs Stanley. I can take over.

633
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,960
- 很好 谢谢你 多蒂 - 再见
- Good. Thank you, Dot. - Bye-bye.

634
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,720
我脑子里都是别人杀人放火 违法犯纪的事
How am I going to be able to come home to you and our own kids...

635
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,400
怎么回家面对你和孩子们呢?
..when my head's so full of these terrible things people do?

636
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,520
那女孩跟你差不了多少 多蒂
That girl wasn't much younger than you, Dottie.

637
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,314
要是你没遇到费雪小姐 
If you hadn't had met Miss Fisher, 

638
00:48:03,315 --> 00:48:04,800
可能就发生在你身上了
that could've been you.

639
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,040
可我遇见费雪小姐了 那不是我
But I did meet Miss Fisher, and it wasn't me.

640
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,720
世界上还是有好事的
And there are good things in the world too.

641
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,640
看啊
Look.

642
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,240
- 我以为你和萝丝在一起 - 刚刚是
- I thought you were with Rosie. - I was.

643
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,440
- 太晚了吗 - 从不会
- Is it too late? - Never.

644
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,040
我从没见过她那样
I've never seen her like that before.

645
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,920
她惊呆了 她需要人陪
She was in shock. She... just needed some company.

646
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,920
她需要你 杰克·罗宾森
She needed you, Jack Robinson.

647
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,520
一位正直不阿的男人
The man who always does the right thing.

648
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,160
做光荣的事
The noble thing.

649
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,200
- 也不总是 费雪小姐 - 那是婴儿吗
- Not always, Miss Fisher. - Was that the baby?

650
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,480
- 天这么晚了 探长 - 是的 的确
- Oh. It's very late, Inspector. - Yes. Yes, it is.

651
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,440
但我很高兴我们说清了 费雪小姐
But I'm glad we cleared up that detail, Miss Fisher.

652
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,040
我也是 杰克 我也很高兴
So am I, Jack. So am I.

653
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,520
好了 小家伙 我来了
It's alright, little man. I'm coming.

654
