估计是法官要优先处理

都是该死的媒体 都盯着帮会的事

他们把我拖出去 和我的律师谈了

你要告诉Gaalan 明天务必要行动 明白吗？
But you tell Gaalan he has got to
make this happen tomorrow, all right?

74
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:32,177
这非常关键
Pope was capital.

75
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:35,219
要是我得到有罪判决 鬼知道他们会把我送到哪
That guilty verdict can send me anywhere.

76
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:37,567
那么 一切事情都告吹
And then all this goes away.

77
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:41,947
我会转告的
I'll pass it along.

你 呃 需要我帮你把东西放到哪儿吗 亲爱的？
You, um, you want me to put this someplace, sweetie?

141
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:08,665
不 我自己来 亲爱的 谢谢
No. I got it, darling.Thank you.

142
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:13,865
不介意的话 我想在这对付几晚
Just gonna crash here for a few
nights, if you don't mind.

143
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:15,622
当然不介意
Of course not.

144
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,107
来吧
Come on.

145
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:21,140
暂时把你的东西放到我的房间
Put your stuff in my room for now.

146
00:13:21,605 --> 00:13:23,118
感激不尽
Appreciate that.

147
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,950
什么原因让你不在家里住？
Any reason why you're not sleeping at home?

148
00:13:26,102 --> 00:13:27,908
呃 你不会想知道的
Uh, you don't wanna know.

149
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,312
由你吧
You're probably right.

150
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:35,874
嘿
Hey.
嘿
Hey.

151
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,257
怎么了？
What's going on?

152
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,992
是关于Clay的事情
I got a Clay thing.

153
00:13:41,035 --> 00:13:43,086
我们还有 关于爱尔兰人的事
We've got an Irish thing.

154
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:45,718
用我的办公室吧
Use my office.

155
00:13:52,953 --> 00:13:54,534
我是Gemma Teller
Gemma Teller.

156
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:56,814
我是Colette Jane 幸会
Colette Jane.Pleasure.

157
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,675
久仰大名
That's what I hear.

158
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,144
Clay想要见我
Clay wants to see me.

159
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:13,444
他的律师说 他下午过来接我
Lawyer says he can get me in this afternoon.

160
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:15,474
他有没有说什么原因？
Did he say why?

161
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,987
他想签署一些文件
Papers he wants signed.

162
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:19,582
就是这一类的事情
Something like that.

163
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:22,424
也许他只是想找个见面的借口
It's probably just an excuse for a sit-down.

164
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,883
爱尔兰人那边又是怎么回事？
What's going on with the Irish?

165
00:14:29,874 --> 00:14:32,207
没事 大多数事情他都很清楚
It's okay. He knows most of it.

166
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:36,246
好吧 Gaalan来了
Okay.Gaalan's in town.

167
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:37,889
说要我们去碰个面
Says we have to see him.

168
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:40,333
Nor-u-Bev 饮料仓库 20分钟之后
Nor-u-Bev, 20 minutes.

169
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,727
你认为会是什么事情？
Got any idea what it might be?

170
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:45,218
不清楚
No.

171
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:48,241
我们应该马上出发 一会桥上会很塞车
We should get going, the bridge is gonna be jammed.

172
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,397
我有些事情想告诉你和Nero
I got something I need to tell you and Nero.

173
00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:54,226
需要我们回避吗？
You want us to split?

174
00:14:54,323 --> 00:14:55,792
不用
No.

175
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,263
我要你们也听听
I want you to hear this, too.

176
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,561
昨晚我和Lowen谈过
I talked to Lowen last night.

177
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:12,507
了解到了一些真相 关于Tara的事情
I got some truth about what happened with Tara.

178
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,144
她根本没有怀孕
She was never pregnant.

179
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:23,840
Tara算计我老妈....
Tara set up my mom...

180
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,479
让它看上去是流产了
made it look like a miscarriage

181
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:35,212
这样就能让我签字同意 不让Gemma成为我儿子的法定监护人
so that I would sign off on Gemma never
becoming legal guardian of our sons.

182
00:15:38,148 --> 00:15:40,307
她想和我离婚
She wants to divorce me.

183
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,774
她想争取到完全监护权 还想一走了之
She wants full custody, and she was gonna split.

184
00:15:48,342 --> 00:15:50,388
老天
Jesus.

185
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:53,724
要是她进监狱怎么办？
What about jail?

186
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:57,114
假如她真的要服刑 她要确保
Well, if she served time,she was gonna make sure

187
00:15:57,214 --> 00:16:02,978
Wendy成为监护人 并且要她把孩子们从Charming镇带走
Wendy became guardian and that she got my sons out of Charming.

188
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:12,938
对不起 我没有相信你的话
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

189
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:16,357
你怎么可以这样？
How could you?

190
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:19,335
我很难过 亲爱的
I'm so sorry, honey.

191
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:24,218
对不起 老兄
Sorry, man.
我理解 兄弟
I know, mano.

192
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,655
没事的
It's okay.

193
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,194
你打算怎么办 兄弟？
What do you want to do, brother?

194
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:36,127
眼下 我让West看着Tara...
I got West watching Tara right now...

195
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,604
确保她不会乱跑
making sure she doesn't go anywhere.

196
00:16:41,176 --> 00:16:43,519
我现在实在是有点想不通
None of this makes sense to me right now.

197
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,843
我想我需要一些时间 想想解决的办法
I just think I need a couple days, figure it out.

198
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:48,931
她不认识West
She doesn't know West.

199
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:53,028
也许叫一个熟面孔跟着她会更好些
Might be better if she had a familiar face behind her.

200
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:57,271
让她只在家附近转悠
Keep her motivated to stay close to home.

201
00:16:57,706 --> 00:16:59,188
我去看着她吧
I can watch her.

202
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:04,045
嗯 好吧 谢谢
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

203
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:05,590
我们都站在你一边 兄弟
We're here, man.

204
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,896
有什么需要尽管开口
Let us know if you need anything.

205
00:17:10,432 --> 00:17:12,800
好了 我们走吧
All right, let's get out of here.

206
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:15,659
你应付这里？
You handle this?

207
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:17,257
是的 这里有我
Yeah, I got it.

208
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:23,383
对不起
I'm sorry.

209
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,317
与Clay小心点
Be careful with Clay.

210
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:28,831
我没事
I'll be fine.

211
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:32,218
当心那个贝尔法斯特屠夫
Be careful with the butcher of Belfast.

212
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:35,291
我们会尽量保证安全
We'll try to stay in one piece.

213
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:38,565
回头见
I'll see you later.

214
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,572
嗯 回见
Yeah, you will.

215
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:49,363
他陷进去多久了？
How long has he been dipping into that?

216
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:50,956
不太久
Not long.

217
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,615
嘿 他只不过解决妈咪问题
Hey, he's working out his mommy issues.

218
00:17:55,932 --> 00:17:58,539
那么你呢 皮条老爹？
How 'bout you, pimp daddy?

219
00:17:58,623 --> 00:18:00,554
你也想解决某个妈咪问题？
You want to work out some mommy issues?

220
00:18:00,635 --> 00:18:02,423
嘿 这就是为什么我和你在一起的原因
Hey, that's why I'm with you, mama.

221
00:18:03,771 --> 00:18:05,981
我可要打你那性感的小屁股
I may spank that brown ass.

222
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:10,330
小心点
Be careful.

223
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:23,208
估计能搞定 完了以后我们再谈
Consider it handled. We'll talk when it's done.

224
00:18:23,918 --> 00:18:25,065
他们来了
They're here now.

225
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:26,547
Jackson.

226
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:29,056
谢谢你啊 这么快就赶过来了
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

227
00:18:29,152 --> 00:18:32,051
嗯 什么事情这么重要？
Yeah. So what's so important?

228
00:18:33,925 --> 00:18:36,106
时间紧迫 小伙子
It's all about the timing, son.

229
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:38,078
听说Clay都打过电话了
Heard Clay made his calls.

230
00:18:38,848 --> 00:18:41,678
是的 每个买家都搞定了 除了那帮意大利佬
Yeah, everyone's locked down except the Italians.

231
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:43,893
Cacuzza 还在犹豫不决
Cacuzza's undecided.

232
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:47,423
那可是你的大客户
That's your biggest customer.

233
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:50,666
三个大家族 两大块地盘
Three families, two territories.
我知道
I know.

234
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:53,690
他正在权衡中国佬的价码
He's weighing an offer from the Chinese.

235
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:55,648
我还以为Jimmy是Clay的忠诚客户
I thought Jimmy was loyal to Clay?

236
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:57,098
他是的
He is.

237
00:18:57,368 --> 00:19:00,887
他只是想让我们为他们的生意着急上火
He's just trying to make us do
a little dance for their business.

238
00:19:00,984 --> 00:19:02,369
你们什么时候谈判？
So when do you talk?

239
00:19:02,444 --> 00:19:03,723
这儿完了我们就去
We're on our way from here.

240
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:07,442
Cacuzza先见我们 然后才见林氏家族
Cacuzza's meeting with us
first, then the Lin family.

241
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:11,454
我认为我们应该给他展示一些新产品
I figured we'd show him some of the new mods.

242
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:12,857
已经准备好了
Already assembled.

243
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:14,670
我们带了9箱AK冲锋枪
Got nine cases of the AK's

244
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,826
配备新型瞄准器和枪托
with the new scopes and grips.

245
00:19:17,182 --> 00:19:19,480
我们可以把这些新货带上 帮助你们达成交易
We can bring 'em to the meet,help you close the deal.

246
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:23,008
很好 我会搞定Cacuzza
That's okay. I'll get Cacuzza on board.

247
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,418
肯定的 但你必须带上Conor一起去
No doubt. But just take Connor.

248
00:19:25,796 --> 00:19:29,750
为了表示敬意 让他们知道 我们有多重视与他们的生意
Shows respect, lets them know how
much we value their business.

249
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:31,237
有道理的
Makes sense.

250
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,477
我会让你做主
I'll let you run it.

251
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:37,206
没时间扯皮了 小伙子
No time for discussion, son.

252
00:19:37,296 --> 00:19:39,316
我们必须今天就把生意谈下来
We need to close the deal today.

253
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:41,040
为什么这么着急？
What's the big rush?

254
00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:43,055
为什么我会这样要求
Why I asked you here.

255
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,928
是因为Clay的庭审提前了
Clay's trial has been moved up.

256
00:19:46,915 --> 00:19:48,837
他们明天就会把他转送出去
They transport him tomorrow.

257
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:51,946
哦 糟了
Aw, shit.

258
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:55,296
是啊 我们的计划有麻烦了
Aye. It complicates our plan.

259
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:56,772
我们需要一些帮助
Gonna need some help.

260
00:19:58,507 --> 00:20:00,971
我们不会参与劫持囚车
We're not part of taking down that transport.

261
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,901
我们准备好撤退的车辆、路线和行动计划 
I have the vehicles, the route, the plan.

262
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,148
不费吹灰之力
It'll happen without a hitch.

263
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:08,743
我的人来不及赶过来
I can't get a crew here in time.

264
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:10,540
我需要你们6个人做帮手
Need about six of your men.

265
00:20:11,227 --> 00:20:13,149
要是我说“不”呢？
And what if we say no?

266
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:22,271
你真的不可以这样 Jackson
You really can't, Jackson.

267
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,991
把这个建议交到你们的议事堂 投票表决吧
Take it to your table, have one of your votes.

268
00:20:26,095 --> 00:20:28,274
我们彼此都需要这事能成
But we both need this to happen.

269
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:31,796
让我们的枪支生意继续推进 让你们全身而退
Moves guns forward for us, puts 'em behind you.

270
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:39,973
我会给你答案
I'll get you an answer.

271
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:42,984
有些具体细节需要敲定
Have a few more details to lock down.

272
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,145
然后我会告诉你全部计划
Then I can bring you all up to speed.

273
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:47,188
嗯 好的
Yeah, okay.

274
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:54,894
怎样 Clay的事情怎么办？
So what, what do we do about Clay?

275
00:20:56,466 --> 00:20:58,886
我认为我们没有其他的选择
I don't think we have much of a choice.

276
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,753
我们也没有时间慢慢商议了
We don't have time to take it to the table.

277
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,878
如果我们不想这么做
If we don't want to do this,

278
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:04,932
我们就必须找其他愿意干的人
we gotta find somebody who will.

279
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:08,129
我打电话回堂口 让他们投票
I'll call TM, get the vote.

280
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:12,364
Jax Gaalan确实很疯狂 但他人很聪明
Jax, Gaalan, Gaalan's a
lunatic, but he's smart, man.

281
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:13,904
不管计划怎样
No matter what the plan is,

282
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,674
他们绝不会拿他们自己去冒险
they're not gonna put themselves at risk.

283
00:21:16,104 --> 00:21:17,974
我知道 那样就更麻烦了
I know.That's the problem.

284
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:20,985
爱尔兰被抓之前就会挂掉
Irish will die before they get caught.

285
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:25,286
是啊 要是这件事情出了差错
Aye. And if this shit goes sideways, they're

286
00:21:25,398 --> 00:21:27,785
他们肯定会采取血腥手段突围出去
gonna blast a very bloody way out.

287
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,641
就差他妈的一点 我们就成功了
We're so damn close.

288
00:21:32,597 --> 00:21:33,949
我可不想 我们退出枪支生意的最后努力
I don't want our last push out

289
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,618
因为死了一大帮子警察而泡汤
of guns to end in a pile of dead cops.

290
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:38,640
不会的 兄弟
It won't, brother.

291
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:51,489
是的 我知道 我知道
Yeah, I know, I know.

292
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,941
嗯哼 好的
Uh-huh. All right.

293
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:57,174
好的 哥们
All right, mate.

294
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,317
问过每位兄弟 他们都同意帮爱尔兰人一把
Talked with everyone, they're good with helping the Irish.

295
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:07,918
好吧 看来我们入伙了
Okay. Looks like we're in.

296
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,183
事情差不多就这么定了
Door's almost shut, brother.

297
00:23:06,656 --> 00:23:08,725
行 行 不管哪个都可以
Yeah, yeah, e-either one would be good.

298
00:23:09,808 --> 00:23:12,026
没有更快点的？好吧
Nothing sooner? Okay.

299
00:23:12,147 --> 00:23:14,787
不 不 不 不行 是的
No, no, no, I can't. I did.

300
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,434
好 好 好 多谢 算了
Okay, okay, okay, thanks.Just forget it.

301
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,933
妈的
Shit!

302
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,420
我知道你在里面 Wendy
I know you're in there, Wendy.

303
00:23:40,348 --> 00:23:43,350
嘿 怎么了？
Hey. What's going on?

304
00:23:53,727 --> 00:23:57,326
我知道你把一切都告诉了Gemma
I know you told Gemma everything.

305
00:24:00,176 --> 00:24:03,504
你觉得现在怎么办 嗯？
What do you think happens now, hmm?

306
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,168
对我们两个人来说
To both of us?

307
00:24:05,865 --> 00:24:08,969
事情已经糟糕得不能再糟了
Can't be any worse than
anything that's already happened.

308
00:24:13,463 --> 00:24:15,147
老天
Jesus Christ.

309
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,437
你又吸高了？
Are you high?

310
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,046
没有
No.

311
00:24:22,522 --> 00:24:25,045
我只是想从另外的角度思考一下
I'm just trying to get on the other side of it now.

312
00:24:40,966 --> 00:24:44,731
Jax....知道了一切
Jax... knows everything.

313
00:24:45,862 --> 00:24:48,151
你知道这意味着什么？
Do you know what that means?

314
00:24:49,324 --> 00:24:51,514
他会反对把Gemma踢出局
He'll have the claim against Gemma thrown out.

315
00:24:51,634 --> 00:24:55,776
要是我进了监狱 Gemma将会获得孩子们的监护权
And she'll get custody of my boys if I go to jail.

316
00:24:56,889 --> 00:24:57,988
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

317
00:24:58,103 --> 00:24:59,424
不
No.

318
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:04,046
你到底在想什么？
- What were you thinking?
没想什么
- I wasn't.

319
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:05,687
到底他妈的什么意思？
What the hell does that mean?

320
00:25:05,783 --> 00:25:07,958
意思是说 要是我以前是一个称职的妈妈
It means, Tara, if I were capable of being

321
00:25:08,072 --> 00:25:11,609
我就不会同意帮你
a mother, I never would've agreed to help you.

322
00:25:11,788 --> 00:25:12,906
因为这根本就是个错误
Because it was wrong.

323
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:16,472
是啊 你的事后诸葛亮这会儿没有用
Yeah, well, your Hazleton
hindsight doesn't help me right now!

324
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,543
是啊 谢你了 我 我知道
Yeah. Thanks. I-I get it.

325
00:25:18,781 --> 00:25:19,833
听着 我不想再吸了 
Look, I don't wanna use again.

326
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:24,940
我..我真是想戒掉 重新过上清醒的生活
I-I'm just trying to get myself into a
sober living or a rehab or anything.

327
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:34,881
上帝啊 Tara 你也得清醒一下
God, Tara, you gotta come clean.

328
00:25:35,674 --> 00:25:37,749
和Jax谈谈 和Gemma谈谈
Just talk to Jax,talk to Gemma.

329
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,093
他们已经知道真相了
They already know the truth.

330
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:40,752
他们不知道你的真相
They don't know your truth.

331
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:42,213
告诉他们为什么你要这样做
Tell them why you really did this.

332
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:43,934
让他们知道你心里的苦楚
Let them see the pain that you've been in.

333
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:47,349
然后怎样？乞求他们的原谅
And then what? Beg them for forgiveness?

334
00:25:47,427 --> 00:25:49,948
不 别再欺骗了
No. Just stop lying.

335
00:25:50,156 --> 00:25:51,515
这才是正确做法
It's the right thing.

336
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:57,306
我做的一切 都是正当的
Everything I did was right.

337
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,853
Tara 对不起
Tara, I'm sorry.

338
00:25:59,111 --> 00:26:01,942
你能闭嘴吗？你并没有感觉到对不起
Will you stop it?!You are not sorry!

339
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:04,424
知道为什么 你不是一个称职的母亲吗？
Do you know why you're not capable of being a mother?

340
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:06,254
因为你是个胆小鬼
Because you're a coward!

341
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:12,171
我不怕他们 再也不怕了
I'm not afraid of them. Not anymore.

342
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,432
你这什么意思？
What is that supposed to mean?

343
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,426
意思是 你是个愚蠢而软弱的瘾君子
Means you're a stupid, weak junkie.

344
00:26:36,738 --> 00:26:37,903
糟糕
Shit!

345
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:46,489
这个疯婆娘
Crazy bitch!

346
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,015
Jimmy.

347
00:27:03,736 --> 00:27:04,974
别来无恙啊 兄弟
How are you, man?

348
00:27:05,183 --> 00:27:06,718
噢 还行
Ah, we're okay.

349
00:27:07,603 --> 00:27:10,757
只是在一边看着你们演出可不太爽
Not too thrilled about having to put on a gun and pony show.

350
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:12,104
我知道
I know.

351
00:27:12,738 --> 00:27:15,707
但是我也得为我们帮会多做打算 Jax
But I got a lot of years sitting around my table, too, Jax.

352
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,687
你还没出生 Aldo就认识了老林
Aldo's known old man Lin since before you were born.

353
00:27:19,803 --> 00:27:22,985
我必须坦诚的说明这点 和Herry还有他叔叔谈谈
I gotta honor that, talk to Henry and his uncle

354
00:27:23,194 --> 00:27:25,208
至少听听他们要说点什么
at least hear what they gotta say.

355
00:27:28,907 --> 00:27:30,244
爱尔兰人？
Irish?

356
00:27:35,228 --> 00:27:36,197
是的
Yeah.

357
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:37,572
是的 他们也想与会
Yeah, they wanted to be here.

358
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:39,418
以示敬意
Show respect.

359
00:27:42,654 --> 00:27:44,069
Cacuzza先生
Mr. Cacuzza.

00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:47,063
这位是Gaalan O'Shay还有这位Connor Malone

361
00:27:47,172 --> 00:27:49,271
幸会
- Pleasure.
先生们
- Gentlemen.

362
00:27:49,952 --> 00:27:52,122
为了推销生意 我们打过几次交道了
Made quite a commute for the sales call.

363
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:54,315
我们认为值得和你们做生意
We think your business is worth it.

364
00:27:54,401 --> 00:27:57,860
哇哦 早知道我们应该多打交道
Wow. I should do this more often.

365
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,020
你们很看得起我
You guys are great for my esteem.

366
00:28:00,521 --> 00:28:01,929
带了什么好东西？
What do we got?

367
00:28:02,373 --> 00:28:05,247
你知道的 克洛格全自动手枪
Handguns you know, Glocks are full auto.

368
00:28:05,332 --> 00:28:07,030
带有扩展弹夹

369
00:28:07,331 --> 00:28:09,598
Ak冲锋枪是俄国原装存货

完全升级版 全新设计 上膛迅速

371
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:13,978
军用枪柄？

372
00:28:14,103 --> 00:28:16,425
能吸收50%的后坐力
Absorb 50% more recoil.

373
00:28:16,538 --> 00:28:18,361
这是全新的艾尔肯瞄准镜
It's the new ElCan scope.

374
00:28:25,674 --> 00:28:27,651
喂 Jax 中国佬来了
Yo, Jax, Chinese.

375
00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:42,224
试试这瞄准镜 它能够在3个街区外撕烂新教徒的一根头发
Try the scope. It can split a
Protestant hair from three blocks away.

376
00:28:42,348 --> 00:28:44,278
耶 你真是个天主教的好孩子
Ah, a good Catholic boy.

377
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:50,747
嗯 感觉真不错
Yeah, that feels good.

378
00:28:50,824 --> 00:28:52,869
打在人身上效果更好
They work even better on flesh.

379
00:28:55,087 --> 00:28:56,995
把枪放下 放下
Put it down! Down!

380
00:28:57,145 --> 00:28:58,131
Chibs 别
Chibs, don't!

381
00:28:58,248 --> 00:28:59,373
走 走 走
Go! Go! Go!

382
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:01,100
快点走 走

383
00:29:01,124 --> 00:29:02,051
走 走 走
Go, go, go!

384
00:29:06,848 --> 00:29:08,250
他妈的搞什么？
What the hell was that?!

385
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:10,960
我就是要让你知道
That was just me letting you know

386
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:13,031
我们是多么看重和你们的生意
how much we want your business, Jimmy.

387
00:29:16,197 --> 00:29:19,507
抱歉这种血腥的场面 但是发出这种强烈的信号很有必要
Apologies for the blood, but a strong message was needed.

388
00:29:19,642 --> 00:29:22,452
我确信 你能理解这种重要性
I'm sure you can understand the importance of that.

389
00:29:22,564 --> 00:29:25,639
嗯 这种信号是什么？
Mm. What message was that?

390
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:30,347
在北加州这块地盘上 我们是唯一的武器供应商 林清楚这点
We're the only source for guns
in Northern California. Lin knew that.

391
00:29:30,462 --> 00:29:34,478
这可是破坏了 我们所推崇的自由贸易的规则
That kinda undermines the free market
strategy that we were attempting here.

392
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:37,728
我们能提供更好的武器 更优惠的价格
We've better guns, better price.

393
00:29:37,927 --> 00:29:39,456
你知道会发生这样的事吗？
Did you know this was going down?

394
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:44,178
不 这不是我和你谈生意的计划 Jimmy
No. This wasn't the way I
planned to get your business, Jimmy.

395
00:29:44,288 --> 00:29:46,844
现在就给你两折的价格
You've been paying 20% above cost.

396
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:50,484
明年Clay接手后 可以降到1折
I'll drop it to ten for the next year
while Clay makes the transition.

397
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:53,515
完了以后 最多1.8折
After that, it tops out at the 18%

398
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:56,456
这会让我们的一些人感到很不安
This is gonna upset some of my people.

399
00:29:57,492 --> 00:30:00,891
1折18个月怎样
10% for 18 months.

400
00:30:01,003 --> 00:30:02,930
完了以后变成1.5折
Then it jumps to 15.

401
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,896
两年至少1折 以后1.2折
Two years at 10%, then it jumps to 12.

402
00:30:16,317 --> 00:30:19,985
行 我们成交吗？
Fair enough. Do we have a deal?

403
00:30:20,076 --> 00:30:23,376
是的 我认为我可以让所有人都理解
Yeah. I think I can make everyone understand.

404
00:30:25,378 --> 00:30:27,028
太好了
Excellent.

405
00:30:27,257 --> 00:30:29,568
把尸体扔到车上
- Throw the body in the car.
我们去办
- We'll get it.

406
00:30:31,174 --> 00:30:33,742
和你们的人讨论过新的安排吗？
Did you discuss the new arrangements with your table?

407
00:30:33,841 --> 00:30:35,638
是的 我们同意参加
Yeah. We're good with that.

408
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:38,381
但是这单破事
But this shit?

409
00:30:39,326 --> 00:30:41,360
这可是个麻烦
This is a complication.

410
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:42,979
不 不是的
No, it's not.

411
00:30:43,313 --> 00:30:45,760
先生们 合作愉快
Gentlemen, been a pleasure.

412
00:30:47,828 --> 00:30:49,455
我也没有料到
I didn't know this was coming.

413
00:30:49,709 --> 00:30:51,451
抱歉
Sorry.

414
00:30:57,567 --> 00:30:59,952
你的拍档很会谈生意
Your partner knows how to close a sale.

415
00:31:00,063 --> 00:31:01,524
是啊 我很抱歉
Yeah. I'm sorry.

416
00:31:02,378 --> 00:31:04,434
现在你知道我为什么要退出了
Now you know why we're getting out.

417
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:08,259
别担心 孩子
Don't sweat it, kid.

418
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,197
我永远都不会和中国佬交心的
I was never gonna go with the chinks.

419
00:31:16,591 --> 00:31:18,746
想办法联络林或者那个那个老头
Try to get ahold of Lin or the old man.

420
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:20,370
我们必须摆脱这个干系
We need to clean this shit up.

421
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:21,642
相信我 我会搞定
Trust me, I'm on it.

422
00:31:24,912 --> 00:31:27,447
这可没办法让林相信 不是我们设计好的
There's no way Lin's gonna believe we didn't plan this.

423
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:31,186
我们把中国佬惹火了 奥克兰州那边就会有麻烦了
We burn the Chinese, things are gonna jump off in Oakland.

424
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:33,296
那会怎样？
Then what happens?

425
00:31:35,463 --> 00:31:37,444
那么我们将失去江湖平衡
Then we lose the balance.

426
00:31:58,259 --> 00:31:59,977
我刚接到Wendy的电话
I just got a call from Wendy.

427
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:01,744
Tara去过她那
Tara went to her place.

428
00:32:01,858 --> 00:32:03,677
嗯 似乎非常恼火
Uh, very pissed off.

429
00:32:03,866 --> 00:32:05,859
说她想搞清楚一些事情
Said she seemed unraveled.

430
00:32:05,982 --> 00:32:06,984
什么意思？
What does that mean?

431
00:32:07,076 --> 00:32:10,540
我也不清楚 我让Rat把Juice和他的车接回来
I don't know, but we just sent
Rat to pick up Juice and his bike.

432
00:32:11,114 --> 00:32:13,151
Tara把他的车给撞了 摆脱他的跟踪
Tara backed over him to the lose the tail.

433
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:15,653
该死
Damn.
孩子们在哪？
Where are the boys?

434
00:32:15,738 --> 00:32:17,941
他们还在日托所里
They're still in day care.
Juice没事吧
Juice okay?

435
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:19,389
嗯 他也很恼火
Yeah, he's just pissed.

436
00:32:19,676 --> 00:32:22,460
好吧 告诉Rat 把Juice送到圣托马斯医院
All right, tell Rat to take Juice down to St. Thomas.

437
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:24,265
看好孩子们
Keep an eye on those boys.
是的
Yeah.

438
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:27,075
嗯 我想还是我去照看Tara比较合适
Uh, I think I better be the one to go look for Tara.

439
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:29,416
我认为你最好去看看Wendy
I think you should check on Wendy.

440
00:32:29,555 --> 00:32:31,303
听上去她不太好
She didn't sound so good.

441
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:32,816
又吸高了？
High?

442
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,456
呃 是病了
Uh, sick.

443
00:32:35,665 --> 00:32:39,123
不 你去看看Wendy 我得去探望Clay
No, you got to go check on Wendy.I got to go see Clay.

444
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:41,840
我们拿Tara怎么办？
What do we do about Tara?
让她自己想清楚
Let her unravel.

445
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:45,661
也许我该和你一起去 和Wendy谈谈
Maybe I should go with you, talk to Wendy.

446
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:47,747
用瘾君子的方式谈
Junkie to junkie.

447
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:51,024
好吧 要是你想的话
Yeah, if you want.
我来开车
I'll drive.

448
00:32:51,126 --> 00:32:52,373
开那部车？
In that?

449
00:32:52,477 --> 00:32:54,964
来吧 Wayne 我让你感受一下地道的西班牙风格
Come on, Wayne, I'll get you
in touch with your inner cholo.

450
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:58,768
那我宁愿割掉我内脏
I had that removed with my spleen.

451
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,081
这只是个癌症的小玩笑
It's a little cancer humor.

452
00:33:02,283 --> 00:33:03,457
好吧
Right.

453
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:05,357
我打电话给Rat
I'll call Rat.

454
00:33:08,432 --> 00:33:09,976
打起精神....
Just a heads up...

455
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:12,505
他只是有点爱我
he's kind of in love with me.

456
00:33:13,132 --> 00:33:14,342
开心点
Have fun.

457
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:11,429
我不知道有人在
I didn't know anyone was here.

458
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,827
你想要干嘛？
What do you want?

459
00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:20,739
顺便路过 拿些孩子们的东西
Coming by to get some of the boys' things.

460
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,756
要是他们到奶奶家过一段时间 也许能用上
Just in case they need to spend some time at Grandma's.

461
00:34:25,077 --> 00:34:26,780
是吧 那是不可能的
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

462
00:34:27,182 --> 00:34:28,574
真的吗？
Really?

463
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:35,149
那你认为会怎样 Tara？
And what is it you think is going to happen, Tara?

464
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:43,112
你知道为什么你那么讨厌我所做的一切
You know why you hate what I did so much?

465
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,911
因为这些事情你应该做到的
Because it's something you would've done.

466
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:51,948
你一直是我的师傅 Gemma 
You've been my teacher, Gemma, my...


467
00:34:52,414 --> 00:34:56,034
我的教练 自从我回到Charming镇以后
old lady coach since I came back to Charming.

468
00:34:56,146 --> 00:34:58,111
虽然你并不为我感到骄傲
Thought you would've been proud of me.

469
00:34:58,485 --> 00:35:01,397
想方设法保护家人
Pushing the envelope to protect my family.

470
00:35:01,509 --> 00:35:04,724
是啊 为了保护家人 我做过很多事情
Yeah, there's a lot of things I'd do to protect my family.

471
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:09,381
伪造孩子的死亡--可不包括在内
Faking the death of a baby--that ain't one of them.

472
00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:11,881
看来是我把你看走眼了
Guess I misjudged you.

473
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:16,096
没想到你也有底线
I didn't realize you had a
line that couldn't be crossed.

474
00:35:16,397 --> 00:35:19,304
似乎你把所有人都看走眼了 亲爱的
Seems you misjudged everyone, darling.

475
00:35:19,904 --> 00:35:22,106
这就是为什么 你现在成为孤家寡人
That's why you're all alone.

476
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:25,967
从我家滚出去
Get out of my house.

477
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,277
如果不呢？
Or what?

478
00:35:31,037 --> 00:35:33,138
你要把我赶出去吗？
You gonna run me over?

479
00:35:34,584 --> 00:35:37,069
你无路可走了 孩子他妈
Your bridges are all burning, Mom.

480
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:40,197
我认为你最好多交点朋友
I'd think you'd be trying to make as many friends as possible.

481
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:43,007
我不需要朋友 我有我的家人
I don't need friends. I have my family.

482
00:35:43,646 --> 00:35:46,397
你真的相信这个 对吗？
You honestly believe that, don't you?

483
00:35:51,993 --> 00:35:54,153
你是怎么想的 这样做能成功？
How'd you think this was gonna play out?

484
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:58,298
假如发生最好的情形 你的计划成功了
Best case scenario,your plan worked.

485
00:35:58,481 --> 00:36:03,618
你和Jax离婚 不管是你还是Wendy 把孩子带到
You divorce Jax, either you or
Wendy take those boys on up to

486
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,212
俄勒冈州或其他什么地方
Oregon or wherever.

487
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:11,775
你真的以为Jax会让这一切发生吗？
Did you really think Jax was gonna let that happen?

488
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:13,819
他别无选择
He'd have no choice.

489
00:36:14,762 --> 00:36:18,716
你有没有想过你老公是何许人物？想过他的能量吗？
Do you have any idea who
your husband is? What he's capable of?

490
00:36:18,808 --> 00:36:21,448
我远比你更了解他
I know him better than you do.

491
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:25,431
哦 不
Oh, no.

492
00:36:26,444 --> 00:36:28,532
很显然你并不了解
Clearly you don't.

493
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:35,612
我儿子爱得越深...恨得也越深
My son loves deep...hates deeper.

494
00:36:36,417 --> 00:36:38,335
这是遗传了我的基因
It's in our genes.

495
00:36:40,142 --> 00:36:42,862
背叛是不可原谅的
Betrayal is unforgivable.

496
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:47,626
你所作所为 还有你打算做的
What you did, what you were planning to do--

497
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,671
都已经无可挽回
there's no coming back from that.

498
00:36:52,423 --> 00:36:58,909
现在你能做的 只有告诉她 你很后悔 然后自己滚蛋
All you can do now is tell him you're sorry and go away.

499
00:36:59,973 --> 00:37:02,323
我绝不会这样做
I'll never do that.

500
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,767
我绝不放弃我的孩子
Not without my sons.

501
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:09,656
你要听我这个建议 Tara
You need to hear this, Tara.

502
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:13,997
并且要完完全全听明白
And understand it on every level.

503
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:19,484
Thomas和Abel不会交给你抚养
Thomas and Abel will not be raised by you.

504
00:37:20,944 --> 00:37:26,883
你现在要做的 只是决定要我们怎样告诉他们
What you do now will determine how we deliver that message.

505
00:37:29,408 --> 00:37:31,341
要不就是 妈妈离家出走了....
Mommy moved away...

506
00:37:32,758 --> 00:37:35,159
或者妈妈去世了
or Mommy passed away.

507
00:37:38,418 --> 00:37:39,941
由你决定
Your call.

508
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:11,300
林和他叔叔都联络不上
Couldn't connect with Lin or the uncle.

509
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,662
打给餐厅 打给仓库
Tried the restaurant,the warehouse.

510
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,137
都没消息
Nothing.
好吧
Okay.

511
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:19,974
我要确保明天的行动
Well, I'm gonna make sure that
tomorrow's job doesn't end up in

512
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:23,335
不会因为与200个警察交火而上“44分钟”特别新闻
a 44-minute gunfight with 200 sheriffs.

513
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,385
你认为这次怎样才能脱身 哥们？
How do you think this one plays out, brother?

514
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:35,031
我也没主意 兄弟
I don't know, man.

515
00:38:35,343 --> 00:38:39,275
要是所有人都指望你的能力 就很难置身事外
It's hard to unplug when everybody
depends on you for the power.

516
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:43,009
哪位？
Yes?

517
00:38:43,096 --> 00:38:44,585
Jax电话找你
I have Jax Teller on the line.

518
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:47,435
把它接进来
Put him through.
二线
Line two.

519
00:38:49,468 --> 00:38:51,381
Teller先生 有何贵干？
Mr. Teller, how can I help you?

520
00:38:51,905 --> 00:38:55,189
今天我们拿到了Diosa Del Sur的执照
We got our license for Diosa Del Sur today.

521
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,598
谢谢你
Thank you.

522
00:38:57,066 --> 00:38:59,999
不客气 现在该轮到你交货了
You're welcome. Now it's your turn to deliver.

523
00:39:00,169 --> 00:39:03,774
我将在48小时之内 把Gaalan交给你
I'll give you Gaalan O'Shay within the next 48 hours.

524
00:39:04,268 --> 00:39:06,267
能说详细一点吗？
Can you be a little more specific?

525
00:39:06,586 --> 00:39:09,992
明天我去找你 把所有细节都告诉你
I'll meet you tomorrow, give you all the details.

526
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:13,402
你那边进行得怎样？
Can you prove your end?

527
00:39:13,526 --> 00:39:16,895
我为你和你们的俱乐部起草了一份豁免协议
I've drafted an immunity deal for you and the club.

528
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,211
让我的手下为Tara做了一份认罪协议
Had my team set up a plea agreement for Tara.

529
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:25,458
会有一些罚金 还有社区服务作为处罚 但是不会进监狱
There's some fines, community service, but no jail time.

530
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:27,033
很好
Good.

531
00:39:28,062 --> 00:39:31,651
Gaalan的手下是一些胆大包天 全副武装的家伙
Gaalan will have a large, well-armed crew.

532
00:39:32,156 --> 00:39:34,963
你们需要很多人手 越多越好
You're gonna need manpower and lots of it.

533
00:39:35,412 --> 00:39:38,518
明天我将告诉你什么时间 什么地点
I'll tell you where and when to send them tomorrow.

534
00:39:48,608 --> 00:39:50,517
你认为她会上钩吗？
Think she'll take the bait?

535
00:39:52,812 --> 00:39:54,627
这要看诱饵是什么
Depends what it is.

536
00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:58,445
好吧 老大 去哪？
Okay, boss, where to?

537
00:40:00,428 --> 00:40:01,977
Colette那
Colette's.

538
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:38,930
那么说 呃..从小你就认识Gemma 是吧？
So, uh... you know Gemma
since she was, like, a kid, huh?

539
00:40:39,025 --> 00:40:40,518
是啊
Yeah.

540
00:40:41,157 --> 00:40:43,947
那时就和现在一样疯狂吗？
She as crazy then as she is now?


541
00:40:44,178 --> 00:40:45,691
我想差不多
I guess.

542
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:52,241
Jax的前妻 这个 呃 Wendy..
Jax's ex, this, uh, Wendy...

543
00:40:52,342 --> 00:40:54,101
她戒了一段时间还是...？
sh-she been clean for a while or...?

544
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,321
是的
Yeah.

545
00:40:59,445 --> 00:41:01,352
她在Charming镇长大的？
She grow up here in Charming?

546
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,314
不是
No.

547
00:41:08,984 --> 00:41:10,731
我猜想是癌症把你一部分脑子腐蚀掉了
So I guess the cancer's eaten away that part of your

548
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:12,965
使得你连聊天都不会了
brain that can actually hold a conversation.

549
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:18,384
不 是把我对于那些不在乎的人的耐心给腐蚀掉了
No, it's eaten away at my patience
for people I don't give a shit about.

550
00:41:20,923 --> 00:41:23,783
按我以前的做法 要是有人这样和我说话 通常我会
For the record, someone talks to me that way, I usually

551
00:41:23,883 --> 00:41:26,753
把他的从车里拖出来 请他吃一顿好果子
grab their ass out of the car and
throw them an appropriate beat-down.

552
00:41:26,863 --> 00:41:30,747
那是因为我的病让你原谅我咯
Guess I'm getting a pardon on account of my sickness.

553
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:35,364
喂 瞧 我死过两次 我被人砍过三次
Hey, look, I've been dead twice,
I've been cut open three times.

554
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:39,687
我还有个孩子得了脊裂瘫痪症 可能活不过15岁
I got a kid with spina bifida,
probably won't make it till he's 15.

555
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:43,047
所以说你的癌症 对我来说狗屁都不算 老兄
So your cancer, it don't mean shit to me, man.

556
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,638
我之所以努力搞好关系 是因为我知道Gemma
I'm trying to make an effort here because I know how much

557
00:41:46,731 --> 00:41:48,511
很在乎你
Gemma loves you.

558
00:41:50,243 --> 00:41:52,944
相信我 我明白得了那个病是多么艰难
Trust me, I know how hard it is to earn that.

559

谢谢你让我感觉糟透了
Thanks for making me feel like shit.

560

小心左边

开出去
Jump off!

563

00:43:49,824 --> 00:43:51,862
把枪放下 把枪放下
Put 'em down. Put 'em down.

568

好了 好了
All right, all right.
好了
All right.

569
00:44:06,432 --> 00:44:09,168
我也没办法控制Gaalan的所作所为
We got no control over what Gaalan does!

570
00:44:10,428 --> 00:44:15,154
那个神经病把我们两个弟兄砍成碎块 还把我们该死的堂口炸了个稀巴烂
Psycho just cut two of my guys into
pieces and blew up our goddamn clubhouse!

571
00:44:18,109 --> 00:44:20,828
我们还和Henry与毒品集团一起做生意
We got the cartebusiness with Henry.

572
00:44:21,653 --> 00:44:25,042
凭什么我会让爱尔兰人把他除掉？
Why would we okay the Irish to take him out?

573
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:26,903
冷静
Relax.

574
00:44:27,661 --> 00:44:31,499
我如果要你们死 你们已经死了6次了
If I wanted you dead, I could've
killed you six times already.

575
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:35,066
那他妈的你想要干嘛？
Well, what the hell do you want?

576
00:44:35,505 --> 00:44:37,774
你们要退出枪支生意
You're getting out of the guns.

577
00:44:38,335 --> 00:44:40,346
我们却需要
We should have that business.

578
00:44:40,747 --> 00:44:43,748
和毒品集团的生意渐渐清淡了
The cartel shipments have been grinding to a halt.

579
00:44:43,858 --> 00:44:46,566
我需要道上的生意 这是我们的地盘
We need the street.This is our territory.

580
00:44:46,681 --> 00:44:49,334
这是我们应得的
We own it, we deserve it.

581
00:44:50,296 --> 00:44:52,703
没这么简单 先生
It's not that simple, sir.

582
00:44:54,297 --> 00:44:57,303
那你让我无话可说了 小伙子
Then let me dumb it down for you, son.

583
00:44:58,202 --> 00:45:01,797
你们当中任何一位 要想从这里离开
The only way any of you walk away from here is if you shut

584
00:45:01,897 --> 00:45:05,106
就必须截断爱尔兰人的销售渠道 让我们的家族

控制北加州的枪支生意

586
00:45:14,726 --> 00:45:17,529
我想我也没得选择 是吧？
I guess I don't really have a choice, do I?

587
00:45:17,692 --> 00:45:20,045
是的，你没得选
No, you don't.

588
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,630
当你告诉我哪里能找到Gaalan先生和他的军火
And you close the deal when you tell me where I can find

589
00:45:22,737 --> 00:45:26,591
事情才算完
Mr. Gaalan O'Shay and their guns.

590
00:45:27,026 --> 00:45:30,291
我要他们为今天的所作所为付出代价

以保证大家履行诺言

把你的爪子拿开
