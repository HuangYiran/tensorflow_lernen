崔佛
Trevor!

5
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,620
麦斯
Max.

6
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,340
哇  哇
Whoa, whoa.

7
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,780
尽管威格拿被整个科学界嘲笑
Although Wegener was ridiculed by the scientific community...

8
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,920
但他最终还是证实了
...he was eventually found to be correct...

9
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,120
世界上存在一个叫做“泛大陆”的原始大陆
...in his theory of an original supercontinent called Pangaea.

10
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,290
好吧
Yeah. Okay.

11
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,430
啊  正点
Ah. Come to papa.

12
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,500
嘿  雷诺
Hey, Leonard.

13
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,010
嘿  老友
Hey, man.

14
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,370
老友  我估计你要伤心了          为什么？
-Dude, you ain't gonna be happy. -Why?

15
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,840
基森来了       原来如此
-It's Kitzens. -I see.

16
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,440
你好     崔佛  我最好的朋友
-Hello. -Trevor, there's my favorite colleague.

17
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,950
 艾伦，你好吗？   我还不错
-How are you, Alan? -I'm good.

18
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,390
 你的“泛大陆”课程上得怎样了？  很好
-How's that Con Drift class of yours going? -Fine.

19
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,150
那么少学生听课  看来挺受欢迎的嘛
Does it get echoey in there with so few students?

20
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,160
那么你来这是要做什么呢？我很忙的
So, what do you got on the books? I'm busy.

21
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,530
确实  我看到你确实很忙
No, no, I can see how busy you are.

22
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,900
所以我会尽快的
So I'll try to be as quick as possible here.

23
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,630
学校决定要撤掉你哥哥的实验室
The university is pulling the plug on your brother's lab.

24
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,830
撤掉？
Pulling the plug?

25
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,910
对  我们终于可以有足够的地方用了
Yeah, it's gonna finally give us all the storage space we need.

26
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,010
咱们开门见山吧  这里的设备
Let's get something straight here, this facility is dedicated...

27
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,080
会用来研究麦斯关于
预测火山裂缝的理论
...to the research of Maxwell Anderson's theories predicting the volcanic fissures...

28
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,810
关键是  他的这个理论还没被证实
Which have never been proven.

29
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:01,080
我是说  你那个去世的哥哥所留下的仪器
还有多少个是没有坏的？一个？两个？
I mean, how many of your late brother's sensors are even still active? One, two...?

30
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,730
是三个  以前可是有二十九个
-Three. -It used to be 29.

31
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,860
现在撤掉我们是很不明智的
This is the wrong time to shut us down.

32
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,800
我已经得到了玻利维亚的地震活动性数据
我监测到了蒙古那里有十三毫米的变动
I have got seismic activity in Bolivia. I got a 13 millimeter shift in Mongolia.

33
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,160
艾伦  你不能撤掉我们  留下我们的实验室
Alan, you can't shut us down. Keep the lab open.

34
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,740
这些是麦斯留下的全部遗产  
麦斯去世已经十年了，崔佛
-It's all I've got left of Max. -It's been 10 years since Max, Trevor.

35
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,210
很抱歉  真的
I am sorry about all this. I really am.

36
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,460
崔佛  你在家吗？  我是伊丽莎白
Trevor, are you there? It's Elizabeth.

37
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,860
请接电话
Pick up, please.

38
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,360
好吧  呃  我们现在在95号路
准备去你那里
Okay. Well, uh, we are on the 95, and we're heading your way.

39
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,800
小贤，你要跟你崔叔叔打声招呼吗？
You wanna say hi to your Uncle Trevor, Sean?

40
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,630
不要
No.

41
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,400
只是打声招呼而已  糟糕
Just say hello.   -No.

42
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,100
 我不想说  这次惨了
I don't want to. -Oh, no.

43
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,540
嘿，我是你嫂嫂
Hey, it's your sister-in-law again.

44
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,040
我只是想确定一下你什么时候在家
Just wanted to make sure what time you'd be home...

45
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,980
因为我们准备六点左右到你那儿
... because we'll be there around 6.

46
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,940
好吧，那就这么定了
Okay. Well, we'll be on my cell.

47
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,990
不是吧   小贤很期待见到你
-Oh, boy. -Sean's looking forward to seeing you.

48
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,620
对吧小贤？  才怪
-Right, Sean?  Negatory.

49
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,590
我有点担心，我们可能多走了一个红绿灯
 I'm getting worried that we might've gotten our signals crossed.

50
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,920
请回我电话
Please call me.

51
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,630
我不在家，请留言
I'm not home. Leave me a message.

52
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,660
崔佛  我们正停在你家前面
 Trevor, we're pulling up in front of your building.

53
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,480
崔佛  你在吗？
Trevor, you in there?

54
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,500
嗨
Hi.

55
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,940
嘿  你好啊
-Hey. -How are you, Elizabeth?

56
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,480
啊，还好你在     见到你真好 
-Oh, you're home. -It's so good to see you.

57
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,050
我也觉得
You too.

58
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,120
我刚收到你的留言   嗯哼
-How are you? I just got your messages. -Uh-huh.

59
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,390
你忘了  对吧？   我没有啊
-You forgot, didn't you? -I didn't forget.

60
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,820
我怎么可能忘呢？
How could I forget?

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,490
你没有忘记？   我
-You didn't forget? -I...

62
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,830
好吧  我忘了  但是这并不代表
I forgot. It doesn't mean I haven't been...

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
我不想见我的侄子
...Iooking forward to time with my nephew.

64
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,040
从他九岁开始我就没见过他了吧？
I haven't seen him since he was 9?

65
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,510
是七岁   哇，呵呵
-Seven. -Wow. Ha-ha.

66
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,910
那他准备待多久？
So how long is he gonna be staying again?

67
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,640
十天   我们之前是这么说的吗？
-Ten days. -Is that what we said?

68
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,910
嘿  小贤  你好吗
Hey, Sean. How are you?

69
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,810
应该好
Looking good.

70
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,220
这个是GAME BOY吗？（一种很旧的游戏机）
这是PSP（最新的游戏机）
-Is that one of those Game Boys? -It's a PSP.

71
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,590
哇  小贤起来，跟你叔叔打声招呼
-Cool. -Sean, get up, say hi to your uncle.

72
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,490
“你叔叔”你好
Hi to your uncle.

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,440
上次见到你的时候  你只有这么高
Last time I saw you, you were about this high.

74
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,370
噢！呵呵    嗯，好吧
-Oh! Ha-ha. -Yeah, good one.

75
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,600
拿好了？ 你有我的电话号码
You got that? Okay, you've got all my numbers.

76
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,080
你的机票和护照都在你的包里
You've got your ticket and passport in your bag.

77
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,270
我会在渥太华接你
I will be there to pick you up in Ottawa.

78
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:43,250
到时候我们就会有一栋新房子，开始新的生活
And by then I'll have found us a house and we can start on this big new adventure.

79
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,410
很刺激对吧？  当然
-Pretty exciting stuff, huh? Yeah, it's great.

80
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,460
就像加拿大人一样  刺激――死了
We get to be Canadians. Thrilling, eh?

81
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,860
不必拘谨
Just let yourself in.

82
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,030
跟你待在一起对他很有益处   嗯
-It will be good for him, being with you. -Yeah.

83
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,260
估计对你也有好处
Who knows? Maybe it will be good for you too.

84
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,200
这个给你
This is for you.

85
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,540
什么东西？  是小贤的吗？
What...? Is this Sean's?

86
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,610
不，是麦斯的
No, it's Max's.

87
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,150
麦斯的？  对
-Max's? -Yeah.

88
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,390
嘿  咱们哥俩一起出去玩吧
So, hey, dude. This is gonna be fun.

89
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,000
一定会很有趣
A couple of dudes hanging out.

90
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,640
玩个五天  或者一个星期
Five days, maybe a week.

91
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,300
你懂的  去玩些纯爷们玩的东西
You know, doing dude stuff, what dudes do.

92
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,500
你喜欢棒球吗？你知道我们应该做什么吗？
You like baseball? You know what we should do?

93
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,410
我们应该去一个棒球场
We should go get in a batting cage.

94
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,310
好吧  听着  我不太喜欢你做的这些
Yeah, okay, listen. I don't like this any more than you do.

95
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,680
你只要继续买你的威士忌喝
As long as you keep stocked with Mountain Dew...

96
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,620
看你的电视剧  我们河水不犯井水
...and TiVo Family Guy, we'll get along fine.

97
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,320
 好     哇
-Sure. -Oh, wow.

98
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,860
这些硬币收藏品很不错嘛  嗯
-That's an awesome coin collection. -Oh.

99
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,470
这些算是我养的小宠物吧
Well, kind of a pet project of mine.

100
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,590
呵呵  真幽默   过奖
-Yeah, it's really nifty. -Thanks.

101
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,130
你饿不？  我们可以点外卖
You hungry? We could order in, you know.

102
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,900
例如披萨  中国菜  泰国菜
Maybe some pizza, Chinese, Thai food?

103
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,670
之类的
Subs? Or something like that?

104
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,680
 哇  那是什么
-Wow. -What's that?

105
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:25,380
这些是一个非常伟大的人的遗物
Well, it's a box of possessions of a really great guy.

106
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,050
你爸爸
Your dad.

107
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,620
他的旧棒球手套
His old ball glove.

108
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,060
我妈很少谈起他
Mom doesn't talk about him very much.

109
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,930
我向你保证
Well, you can take my word for it.

110
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,430
他是世间少有的
He was one of those few people...

111
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,340
超级杰出人物
...who are just exceptional at everything they do.

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,150
噢  你看  这个就是咱们老一辈的PSP
Ooh. You see this? This was your old man's PSP.

113
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,910
摇摇？  不要小看这个摇摇
-A yo-yo? -Don't be dissing the yo-yo.

114
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,680
这里面藏着物理学的奥妙  包括离心力
This is physics at work. You got your centrifugal force.

115
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,520
万有引力  势能
Your gravitational pull, you got your potential energy.

116
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,490
而且，你知道吗
And in ancient times, did you know...

117
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,820
在远古时代  这种东西是个捕猎工具
...that this was actually used as a hunting implement?

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,020
看好了
Watch.

119
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,900
让我试试    对，还是让你拿着比较好
-Hey, here, let me try. -Yeah, you should probably take it.

120
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,000
呃  这是什么东西
I have no idea what this is.

121
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,370
哇
Hello.

122
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,150
这是他最喜欢的书
This was his favorite book.

123
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,350
凡尔纳的《地心游记》
Jules Verne's A Journey to the Center of the Earth.

124
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,260
我曾经想在暑假的时候读一读这本书
You know, I think that was on my summer reading list once.

125
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,700
不过始终没有读  那太不应该了  这本书超好看的
-I never got to it. -That's too bad, it's a good read.

126
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,570
对于他来说  这不仅仅是一部科幻小说  更是他的灵感来源
To him, it wasn't just science fiction, it was inspiration.

127
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,770
在我很小很小的时候  他曾经给我念过这本书
He used to read this to me when I was a really little kid.

128
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,880
哇，这些笔记是什么情况？
Hello. What are these notes?

129
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:10,450
蒙古的岩浆温度达到了一千一百五十？
"Magma temperatures reach 1150 in Mongolia"?

130
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,230
玻利维亚
"Bolivia."

131
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,560
夏威夷
"Hawaii."

132
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,500
小心！
Look out!

133
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,400
小贤  咱们去我的实验室看看
Hey, Sean, let's go check out my lab.

134
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,110
不能等明天再做吗？
So it couldn't wait for tomorrow?

135
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,580
你爸经常说
Your dad used to say:

136
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,240
地壳构造物理学是研究现状的科学
而不是用来研究未来的
"Tectonophysics is the science of now, not tomorrow."

137
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,950
它所研究的地质运动
是发生在电光石火之间的
It's about seismic events that occur in an instant.

138
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,990
看这里
Here, look at this.

139
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,930
夏威夷  玻利维亚  蒙古
You got Hawaii, Bolivia, Mongolia.

140
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,430
这些地方的现时数据 跟九七年七月的时候很相似
And the conditions today are almost exactly what they were in July '97.

141
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,730
九七年七月有什么特别吗？
What's the big deal about July '97?

142
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,500
小贤  那是你爸爸失踪的时间
Sean, that was the year that your dad went missing.

143
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,840
你看  这一纵列的数字
Now, look, you see this column of numbers here?

144
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,900
如果这个753  变成752的话  那么就说明……
If the 753, right here, was a 752, then it would be...

145
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,880
完全一致
Exactly the same.

146
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,120
这些信号是什么意思？
What do these little blips mean?

147
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,290
什么都别碰  这些信号是我毕生的心血
Don't touch anything. Those little blips are my life's work.

148
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,860
这四个信号点就是你的毕生心血？
These four little blips are your entire life's work?

149
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,460
三个  三个信号点
Three. Three little blips.

150
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,670
一  二  三  四
One, two, three, four.

151
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,840
冰岛
Iceland.

152
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,740
这就讲得通了
This makes sense.

153
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,050
麦斯在十年前看到了这些数据  然后他马上就去调查
Max saw the readings 10 years ago, and he took off to investigate.

154
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,680
如果现在的数据和当时是一致的话
Now, if the readings are the same today as they were then...

155
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,420
那么这就是我弄清楚一切的唯一机会
...this may be my only chance to find out what happened.

156
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,650
准备好你的护照  干嘛呢？
-I'm gonna need your passport. -For what?

157
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,200
不好意思  我必须提早带你去加拿大
I'm sorry, I have to get you to Canada a little earlier than we planned.

158
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,130
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

159
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,860
我在说这个  《地心游记》
I'm talking about this. A Journey to the Center of the Earth.

160
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:07,510
一切答案都在冰岛  他一定就是在那里失踪的
It's all set in Iceland, which is where he must've gone.

161
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,740
这些全是我爸的笔记？
These are all my dad's notes?

162
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,570
听着
Look...

163
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,390
麦斯和我
...Max and l...

164
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,520
你爸爸和我认为  世上有可能存在一条火山通道
Your dad and I were talking about the possibility of volcanic tubes existing...

165
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,290
能够穿过地幔  直达地球的核心
...that went down past the mantle, towards the center of the Earth.

166
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,730
我想这就是他一直在找的答案
And that's what I think he went looking for.

167
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,100
对不起  明早我必须带你去渥太华
Sorry, I gotta put you on a flight to Ottawa in the morning.

168
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,300
而我则要去冰岛  不 不，听着
-And I'm calling Icelandair. -No, no, look.

169
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,140
嘿  我才刚到这里啊
-Hey. -I just got here, okay?

170
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,900
不要指望你能一走了之
You're not gonna go and ditch me.

171
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,670
况且是我发现你的毕生心血多了一个信号点的
I was the person who found your life's work fourth little blip thingy in the first place.

172
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,340
这是我们兄弟之间的事情  他是我爸
-This is my brother we're talking about. -It's my dad.

173
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,580
我不会去渥太华待十天的  我要跟你去
Now, I don't have to be in Ottawa for 10 days. I'm going with you.

174
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,250
你知道到雷克雅末克（冰岛首都）的机票有多贵吗？
Know how much to book a last-minute flight to Reykjavik?

175
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,190
我觉得你付得起
Something tells me you got it covered.

176
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,640
下来吧  勇敢的旅行者  进去马嚼子雪山的山口
"Descend, bold traveler, into the crater of the jokul of Sneffels...

177
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,410
入口就在斯嘉泰力山峰的阴影之下
..which the shadow of Scartaris touches before the kalends of July...

178
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,780
然后你就会到达地心
...and you will attain the center of the Earth."

179
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,580
呜
Ooh.

180
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,680
见笑了
Sorry.

181
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,690
你在做什么
What are you doing?

182
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,920
我正在破解你爸爸留在书上的这些笔记
I'm deciphering these notations that your father made in this book.

183
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,620
我觉得答案就藏在这些字母之中
I think there's a code behind the pairing of letters.

184
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,290
可能跟元素周期表有关
It might have something to do with the periodic table.

185
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,440
例如  这里的S-A  L-S  G-G
For instance, I've got S-A, l-S, G-G.

186
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,800
我相信这个P-B就代表了元素周期表中的plumbum元素
I believe that P-B is on the periodic table and that's plumbum.

187
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,110
也就是“铅”  那“斯邦 格森”是什么意思
-Plumbum means lead. -What's "Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson"?

188
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,840
什么？
What?

189
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,880
看  这里  竖着读  “斯邦 格森”
Well, it's right here. Read it down. Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson.

190
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,420
噢  呃
Oh. Uh...

191
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,580
斯邦 格森  那就是
Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson, that's...

192
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,820
这是一个线索  可能是指某个地方
That's a clue. Maybe that's a place.

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,290
也可能是某种东西
It could be a thing.

194
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,270
你在干嘛？  我在百度
-What are you doing? -I am Googling at 30,000 feet.

195
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,800
这样做有用吗？   欢迎来到二十一世纪
-Are you supposed to be doing that? -Welcome to the 21 st century.

196
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,460
好了  看   这是一个人名
-Okay. Here. -It's a person.

197
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,830
斯邦・格森  他是格森协会的常务董事
"Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson, executive director...

198
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,570
这个协会主要研究火山进化学
...of Asgeirsson Institute for Progressive Volcanology."

199
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,230
麦斯可能认识这个人
Max would've known this guy.

200
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,250
我就知道带上你是明智选择  这个协会就是我们的第一站
I knew it was a good thing to bring you. His institute has gotta be our first stop.

201
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,120
我们到了吗？
Are we there yet?

202
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,390
不要着急
If you mean annoying, yeah, we're there.

203
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,950
是你开得太慢了  我这叫安全第一
-You know, you're going kind of slow. -I'm going kind of safe.

204
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,730
我刚看见一只山羊走在临时车道上
I just saw a goat in the passing lane.

205
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,960
我们的冒险什么时候才能开始？
When's the whole adventure thing gonna begin?

206
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,870
我给点有趣的事情让你做吧
Let me give you something fun to do.

207
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,540
人肉导航
Navigate.

208
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,610
我们在哪？
Where are we?

209
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,240
我们到了哈赞斯林没？
Have we passed Havanschlicht?

210
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,820
哈赞斯林？  对
-Havanschlicht? -Yeah.

211
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,080
不知道
I don't know.

212
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,410
我们到了英格斯塔没？
Have we passed Eingarsstadir?

213
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,110
不知道  雷林费呢？
-I don't know. -Reynivir?

214
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,690
不知道  胡撒维克？
-I don't know. -Husavik?

215
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,120
不知道  刚德宏？
No.  Grundarhol?

216
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,590
不知道  斯提塔德？
No.  Stifflarschtarder?

217
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,960
斯提塔德什么东西？
Stifflardschtarder?

218
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,570
那昆都卡塔斯金路奎呢？  纳尼？
How about Koldukardarskinoquue? What?

219
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,800
我们绝对是迷路了  没有啊
We're definitely lost. We're not lost.

220
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,340
看看有没有类似协会的建筑物吧
Just look for an institution.

221
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,070
一个协会机构一般是什么样的？  我不知道  应该是像一个协会那样的 
What's an institution look like? -I don't know, it looks big and institutional.

222
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,580
应该是在这附近的了
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

223
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,910
看  那里有间房子  我们可以去那里问问人
Hey, look, there's a little shack up there. We can stop there and ask for directions.

224
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,750
我们没有迷路啊  好吧  你说没就没
-We're not lost. -Oh, no, definitely not.

225
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,860
这是什么？ 滑雪棚？
What's this? A ski shack?

226
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,920
格森协会
"Asgeirsson...

227
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,230
火山进化学
...Institute for Progressive Volcanology."

228
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,840
我就说我找到了嘛
I told you I'd find it.

229
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,400
好吧
Alrighty.

230
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,800
精神一点  好
-Not too shabby. -All right.

231
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,850
不好意思  我不懂冰岛语
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't speak Icelandic.

232
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,950
你好，什么事呢？  你好
-Hi, can I help you? -Hello.

233
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,660
我叫汉娜  啊，你好啊
-I'm Hannah. -Oh, how do you do? Hi.

234
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:20,850
我叫崔  安德森教授  是从美国过来的  呃
I'm Trev... Professor Anderson. I'm visiting from America. Um...

235
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,330
这是我的侄子  小贤  我是小贤
-This is Sean, my nephew. -I'm Sean.

236
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,460
你好
Hi, Sean.

237
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,000
不好意思打扰了  我想找
I was wondering if I could possibly speak with, forgive me here...

238
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,040
斯邦・格森先生
...Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson?

239
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,240
嗯
Um...

240
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,610
斯邦・格森已经死了
Well, Sigurbjorn Asgeirsson is dead.

241
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,970
死了？  对  三年前就死了
-Dead? -Yeah, he died three winters ago.

242
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,480
噢  呃
Oh. Uh...

243
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,240
那你是协会的成员吗？
So do you run the institute?

244
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,350
不是  这里没有什么协会
Nobody does. There is no institute.

245
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,860
可是下面那块牌子写着  火山进化学是一个荒谬的理论
-There's a sign down the road that says... -Progressive volcanology was a failed idea.

246
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,690
就像是  柏林墙和八轨磁带
Like, you know, the Berlin Wall and eight-track tapes.

247
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,700
懂了
I see.

248
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,800
那  你是他同事吗？
Well, did you work with him?

249
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,830
不 不  他是我父亲
No, no. He was my father.

250
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,170
嗯？这本书怎么了？
Yeah? I know it. What about it?

251
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,010
这本书是我死去的哥哥 麦斯的
Well, this book belonged to my late brother, Max.

252
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,210
麦斯・安德森
Max Anderson?

253
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,080
我相信他曾经跟你父亲联系过
We believe that he may have been in contact with your father.

254
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,250
你哥哥是个“凡尔纳教徒”吗？  什么意思？
-Your brother was a Vernian. -What's a Vernian?

255
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,020
就是指那些  觉得凡尔纳写的小说  是真有其事的人
Someone that believes that the writings of Jules Verne were actual fact.

256
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,600
我是说  这个人只是一个科幻小说作家
I mean, the guy was a science fiction writer.

257
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,500
但是这群“凡尔纳教徒”却将他当作神
And yet this society of believers regarded Verne like a visionary.

258
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,540
我父亲就是最狂热的教徒
My father was the biggest Vernian of them all.

259
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,070
我哥哥不是什么异教徒
My brother was no Vernian.

260
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,040
这是我父亲的资料
This was my father's copy.

261
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,880
看一下
Take a look.

262
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,880
看见了吗  这些记号完全一致  你哥哥就是个“凡尔纳教徒”
See, the markings are exactly the same. Your brother was a Vernian.

263
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,400
原来我爸爸是这样的人
Wow, my dad was kind of out there.

264
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,760
你不了解他  小贤  我怀疑你也不了解
-You didn't know him, Sean. -I'm starting to think you didn't either.

265
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,570
他不是什么神秘社团的成员
He was no member of some secret society.

266
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,870
你们来这要做什么？  我是个科学家  是个教授
-What are you guys doing here? -I'm a scientist, I'm a professor.

267
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,740
我来这里是因为  我的地震仪器监测到
I'm here because there are seismic sensors going off 30 klicks north of here...

268
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,880
这里以北三十公里的地方有异样
...that we think that we should check into.

269
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,640
这就是我们来这的原因  很单纯
And that's the reason that we're here, plain and simple.

270
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,080
好吧
Okay.

271
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,590
可是没有公路能够去北方
You know, there are no roads to the north.

272
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,350
呃
Well...

273
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:32,290
我是个登山向导  我可以带你去
I'm a mountain guide. I can take you there, professor.

274
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,630
好  太好了  我喜欢远足
-Great. -That's great, I love hiking.

275
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,490
太感谢你了  好
-I would appreciate that. That'd be great. -Good.

276
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,870
叫我崔佛就好了  叫我小贤
-Call me Trevor. -You can call me Sean.

277
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,400
去那里要五千块钱
So it will be 5000 kronur to go up there.

278
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,300
五千块一天吗？  没问题啊
Five grand a day? No problem.

279
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,100
一个小时
An hour.

280
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,210
一大堆硬币你收吗？
Do you accept rolls of quarters?

281
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,640
快点吧  我想在日落前回家
Come on, boys. I wanna be home by sundown.

282
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,710
嘿  你可以走慢一点吗？
Hey, you think you can slow down a little bit, please?

283
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,880
勃起了  什么？
-Dibs. -What?

284
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,500
我看着登山向导勃起了
I got dibs on the mountain guide.

285
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,860
你才十三岁  当我没说
-You're 13. -Sorry, called it.

286
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,030
才十三岁怎么会勃起呢  当我没说
-Thirteen-year-olds don't get dibs. -Get over it.

287
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,810
我们快要到了
We're getting closer.

288
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,980
好了  小心脚下的路  马嚼子山可是非常崎岖的
All right, just watch your step there. Mount Sneffels is deceptively treacherous.

289
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,350
什么是马嚼子？  不如让教授你来告诉他吧
-What's Sneffels? -Well, why don't you tell him, professor?

290
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,980
马嚼子山就是地心通道的
Sneffels is the name of the mountain where this character Liedenbrock...

291
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,830
地面入口
...apparently found a portal to the center of the Earth.

292
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,520
我们快去找到你的地震仪器吧
Let's just find that sensor of yours, professor.

293
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,670
就在那里
There it is.

294
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,830
太好了
Yes.

295
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,200
接下来你要怎么做呢？
Well, what do you need to do with it?

296
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,870
我要解下它  它就像一个装满了
I gotta unlock it. It's got, like, a black box...

297
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,610
过去十年所有地震活动性数据
...that has recorded all of the seismic activity...

298
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,880
的保险箱
...that's transpired in the last 10 years.

299
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,450
能让我得到很多关于麦斯的信息
Could tell me a lot about Max.

300
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,620
甚至能知道他失踪之前在做什么
And what he was doing when he went missing.

301
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,280
崔佛  打扰一下  我觉得我们必须离开
Trevor, I'm really sorry, we're gonna have to go now.

302
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,620
这仪器一定是被腐蚀生锈了
Must be corroded.

303
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,560
崔佛  我们要   哇
Trevor, we need to... Whoa.

304
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:54,100
好吧  我们要找个掩护物    快来 小贤
Okay, we need to take cover. Come on, Sean. Right now.

305
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,300
我随后就到
I'll be right there.

306
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,570
崔佛  暂时别管它了  我快要好了
-Trevor, just leave it for now. I've almost got it.

307
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,710
我们必须躲起来
We need to take cover now.

308
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,780
快过来  崔佛
Come on. Trevor.

309
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,780
崔佛叔叔  进来这里
-Uncle Trevor. -Get in here.

310
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,050
噢耶！  小心
-Yes. Oh!  Watch out.

311
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,380
赶紧  快点
Hurry up. Come on.

312
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,490
崔佛  那个仪器会把闪电引过来的
Trevor, the sensor's attracting the lightning.

313
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,650
扔了它  扔了那个仪器   你说什么！我才不会扔
-Drop it. Drop the sensor. What? I'm not gonna drop it.

314
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,160
赶紧！ 它把闪电都引过来了！ 
Hurry!  It's attracting the lightning!

315
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
崔佛？
Trevor?

316
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,820
崔佛？  我没事
-Trevor? I'm all right.

317
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,760
小贤？
Sean?

318
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,630
小贤你没事吧？  我没事
-Sean, you all right? -I'm good.

319
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,400
好  大家要保持冷静  快过来帮我挖开它
-Okay, everybody, just stay calm.  Guys, come on, you gotta help me dig.

320
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,070
快来
Come on.

321
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,810
算了吧  行不通的    算了？
-Forget it, it's no use. -Forget it?

322
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,850
她说得对
She's right.

323
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:27,660
我们头上起码压着六七十吨的巨石
There must be about 60 or 70 tons of boulders on top of us.

324
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,560
起码要挖一个月才能挖开
Take us about a month to dig out of here.

325
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,800
我们只能找别的出口  如果没有其他出口呢？
-We have to find another way. -What if there is no other way?

326
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,460
小贤  天无绝人之路
There's always another way, Sean.

327
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,370
你还有什么？
What else have you got?

328
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,680
照明弹  急救包  绳子  毯子  以及一些蛋白棒
Signal flares, first aid, some rope, blankets and a couple of protein bars.

329
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,940
但是这些不够我们吃的
But they're on a ration.

330
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,280
不知道我们要困在这里多久  困？这就是我们的处境？
-Don't know how long we'll be trapped for. -Trapped? Is that what we are?

331
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,520
她  她不是这个意思
She... No, she didn't mean that.

332
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,130
小贤你在干嘛？  可恶  这里不在服务区内
-Sean, hey, what are you doing? -God, I'm not getting any service.

333
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,920
在这下面你是收不到信号的  小贤
Sean, you're not gonna get any signal down here, okay?

334
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,690
收起来 好吗  不要太担心了
Put this away. Okay, don't worry about it.

335
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,030
我们一定会找到路的  好吧
-We'll find another way out, all right?  Okay.

336
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,530
其中一条路应该能回到地面的
One of these might snake back to the surface.

337
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,230
我们怎么知道要走哪条
How do we know which one to take?

338
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,650
我的直觉告诉我走右边这条
My gut says we go right.

339
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,210
来吧
Come on.

340
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,850
看来应该没错
Looks promising.

341
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,160
慢慢来  我们马上就能离开这里了
Just put one foot in front of the other. We'll be out of here in no time.

342
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,560
一切顺利
Looking good.

343
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,670
不要担心  我的第六感很准的
Don't worry, direction is my sixth sense.

344
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,210
小贤  别分心  把它当做野外调查
Pay attention, Sean. It's just like doing field work.

345
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,750
我向来都很喜欢做野外调查
I used to love doing field work.

346
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,110
小心！  啊！
-Watch out. -Ah!

347
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,630
教授  你现在不是在实验室里研究石头
You're not studying rocks in a lab, professor.

348
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,260
现在是生死关头  明白  谢谢
-This is life or death here. -Yeah, thanks.

349
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,460
你欠我一个人情
You owe me one.

350
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,280
这上面写的是什么？
What does this say?

351
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,860
意思是“禁止入内”
That means keep out.

352
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,230
这是明智选择  不 不，这是个好消息
-Maybe that's decent advice. -No, no. This is great news.

353
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,770
这条路有可能通往一个老矿洞  然后我们就能找到出路了
This might lead us to an old mine shaft and that could be our way out.

354
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,030
你觉得这里有多深？  麻烦给我个照明弹
-How deep do you think it is? -Can you give me one of those flares?

355
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,260
谢谢  小贤  准备好你的手表
Thank you. Sean, look at your watch.

356
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,810
我会点着照明弹  然后扔下悬崖
I'm gonna light this and drop it over the edge...

357
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,040
然后你算一下它经过多少秒钟到达底部
...and I want you to tell me how many seconds pass before it stops.

358
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,480
好
Okay.

359
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,950
准备了  三  二
Here we go. Three, two...

360
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,650
啊！我勒个去！
Oh, God!

361
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,300
什么情况？
What?

362
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,230
那是什么？
What was that?

363
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,840
是镁矿
Yup, magnesium.

364
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,350
这些墙壁后面一定是条矿脉
Must run in veins all through these walls.

365
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,880
镁是一种易燃物  对吗，教授？
Magnesium is kind of flammable, isn't it, professor?

366
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,880
对  经常被用来制作照明弹  火药 和 火柴
Yeah, used in flares, used in gun powder, matchsticks.

367
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,720
那么看来在这里不适合用火药和照明弹
Right, well, maybe gun powders and flares aren't such a good idea down here.

368
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,660
谢谢
Thank you.

369
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,060
跟刚才说的方法一样
It's the same principle.

370
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,470
准备好了吗 小贤？  好  扔吧
-You ready, Sean?  Yeah, go ahead.

371
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,160
三  二
Three, two...

372
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,010
一秒
One.

373
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,470
两秒
Two.

374
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,410
差不多三秒
Almost three.

375
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,410
让我算一下  这里有二百英尺深
Thirty-two squared by... It's 200 feet.

376
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,150
那就没问题
That's no problem.

377
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,920
差不多是普通楼房的二十层高
It's about your basic 20-story high-rise.

378
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,420
你的绳子够长吗？  当然够
-You got enough rope? -I always have enough rope.

379
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,690
呃  你们在说什么？
Well, no problem for what?

380
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,130
用绳索吊下去
Rappelling down in there.

381
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,600
我们要下去这个又深又黑的大坑？！
We're gonna rappel down that deep, dark hole?

382
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,530
怎么？ 你有意见？
What, you got a problem with that?

383
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,360
呃  怎么了？
-Pfft. -What's the matter?

384
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,730
我绝对不要下去这里
There's no way we should be rappelling down.

385
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,240
你在说什么？ 你可是能够对着登山向导勃起的男子汉了
What are you talking about? You're man enough to call dibs on the guide.

386
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,400
但我不能用绳子爬下去  你们两个！
-But not enough to climb down a rope.  Guys.

387
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,210
勃起跟这个不一样  以后请不要再谈论这个话题
-Calling dibs on the mountain guide... -No one gets dibs on the mountain guide.

388
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,080
我们下去吧
We're going down there.

389
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,360
稳住  稳住
Steady, steady.

390
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,360
记住  我们是绑在一起的
Remember, we're all connected.

391
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,220
很好
It's okay.

392
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,830
一切顺利
Looking good.

393
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,700
我这边没问题
It's all good down here.

394
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,060
慢慢放
Way down here.

395
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,710
你们会下来的 对吧？
You guys are coming down, right?

396
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,240
到你了 小贤  我会慢慢地把你放下去的
All right, Sean, I'm gonna start lowering you down really, really slowly.

397
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:13,140
你只要身体后仰  双腿高于身体那就可以了  
So just lean back and keep your feet up high.

398
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,610
你行的
You're okay, Sean.

399
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,690
我们是用绳子连在一起的  所以不会有危险的
We're tethered together, so nothing bad is gonna happen.

400
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,320
对  当然
Yeah, sure.

401
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,690
很好
Good.

402
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,320
小贤  向下走
Sean, keep walking.

403
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,700
你必须迈出脚步
You have to keep walking.

404
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,930
好
Good.

405
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,970
嘿  你做得不错嘛
Hey, you're looking pretty good there.

406
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,270
一看就知道你以前没试过这样   闭嘴
-Sure you haven't done this before? -Shut up.

407
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,510
喂  麻烦你注意你的脚下
Hey, you mind? Watch your step, will you?

408
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,380
我现在可是拿命来玩
I'm hanging on for my life here.

409
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,120
小贤  跟我聊聊天放松一下吧
Okay, Sean, just make conversation with me.

410
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,790
呃  汉娜你经常来这里吗？
So, Hannah, do you come here often?

411
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,320
停一下
Oh, give me a break.

412
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,020
你的话题也太无聊了吧
That can't be the best line you can come up with.

413
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,960
我是在跟她聊天  不 小贤  我没有经常来这里
-I'm making conversation with her. -No, Sean, I do not come here very often.

414
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,060
准备好了？
Ready?

415
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,670
嘿
Hey.

416
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,910
看这些岩石
Look at all this schist.

417
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,780
怎么了？  是变质岩
-What? -It's a metamorphic rock.

418
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,750
绿片岩  石榴石  云母
Green schist, garnet schist, mica-garnet schist.

419
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,380
好吧  片岩    你看  到处都是  我估计
-Oh. Schist. -It's everywhere, look at it. I guess...

420
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,320
崔佛
Trevor.

421
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,990
抓住墙壁    我抓不到
Get to the wall, Trevor.  I can't.

422
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:41,500
我离墙壁太远了    你的绳子拉住了我的
-I can't, the walls widen out down here. -Your rope is caught on mine.

423
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:44,040
你会把我们都拉下去的  我必须割断你的绳索
You're gonna take us down. I gotta cut you loose.

424
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,330
什么？  不要啊汉娜
What? -Hannah, no.

425
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,670
等一下啊 喂
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait.

426
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,830
别 别 别
-Don't. Don't, don't, don't.

427
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,140
崔佛叔叔  啊！
-Uncle Trevor. -Ah!

428
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,410
各位  到了
Hey, guys, found it.

429
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,020
这里就是底了
The bottom's right here.

430
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,060
汉娜  你知道我摔不死的对吧？
Hey, Hannah, you knew that, right?

431
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,200
对吧？
Right?

432
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,830
汉娜？
Hannah?

433
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,940
这是什么？
Guys, what's this?

434
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,040
我觉得是一个废弃矿坑
Looks like an abandoned mine tunnel to me.

435
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,780
这是奥布拉格矿坑
That's Old Bla'gils Mine.

436
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,150
自从六十年前那场大灾难之后  它就被封闭了
It was shut down 60 years ago after the big disaster.

437
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,720
灾难？
Disaster?

438
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,650
多大？
How big?

439
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,230
死了八十一个人
Eighty-one dead.

440
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,420
确实是大灾难
That's pretty big.

441
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,760
来吧
Come on.

442
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,100
走
Cowboy up.

443
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,270
崔佛  那本书上有提到这么个矿坑吗？
 Hey, Trevor, was there a mine like this in the book?

444
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,130
应该没有
No, don't think so.

445
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,500
汉娜？  怎么了？
-Hannah? Yup?

446
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,670
我能问你个问题吗？
Can I ask you something?

447
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:05,340
你觉得  你父亲和我哥哥的观点  有没有可能是正确的呢？
Do you wonder if your father and my brother weren't wrong?

448
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,020
我明确地告诉你
Let me make something very clear to you.

449
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,020
我跟我父亲不同
I am not my father.

450
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,100
他的观点跟我一点关系都没有
And the world that he belonged to has nothing to do with me.

451
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,530
懂了  好的
I understand, of course.

452
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,260
我只是问一下
I didn't mean to say that it was or that it would be...

453
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,170
你知道我一直在计时的吧？  你还在算我的钱？
-You know I'm still on the clock, right? -You're still billing me?

454
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,110
一直算到我平安回到家
I bill you until I'm safe in my house.

455
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:31,580
呵  汉娜
-Huh.  Hannah?

456
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,750
这是什么？
What's that?

457
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:41,050
这是一台老式发电机  嘿  别乱碰
-This is the old generator for the mine. -Hey, you don't want to touch that.

458
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,560
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

459
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,250
那台旧机器估计很不稳定的
There might be some volatile compounds there, you know.

460
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:50,370
确实很不稳定     汉娜  它有可能会爆炸
-Serious generator. Hannah, that thing could blow up.

461
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,590
不要拉下开关
Stop throwing switches.

462
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,240
等一下  别啊
Don't do that. No, wait.

463
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,890
别碰那个东西
Get away from that thing.

464
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,210
好吧  当我没说过
Okay, I take it back.

465
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:15,360
这里会有出口对吧？  那些矿工总得把挖到的东西运出去
This is it, right? I mean, the miners, they had to get their stuff out somewhere.

466
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,760
对  这些轨道可以通到外面
Yeah.  These tracks could lead us out.

467
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,560
汉娜  有多少矿工逃过那场灾难？
Hey, Hannah, how many miners got out?

468
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,000
一个
One.

469
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,760
那就代表有希望  我打前锋
That's a start. I call front.

470
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,600
什么？ 别 别 别
What? No, no, no.

471
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,070
不要进去那里
Come on, don't get in there.

472
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,070
我们不知道这些东西有没有坏
We don't even know if these things work.

473
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,260
这样很不安全
They're not safe.

474
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,770
这些轨道也未必安全
The tracks might not be safe.

475
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,550
引擎看起来没问题  进来
Track ahead looks good. Get in.

476
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,120
小贤  你这样很危险  是我就不会那样做了
Hey, Sean, it doesn't look safe. I wouldn't do that.

477
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,460
我好像看见了什么  那是……
I think I see something. It's...

478
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,770
那是阳光吗  不是的话就不用告诉我了
Please tell me it's daylight. Otherwise, I don't wanna know.

479
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,860
呃
Uh...

480
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,800
不  那不是阳光
No, it's not daylight.

481
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,210
噢  我们要掉下去了
Oh, we're in deep schist.

482
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,250
真希望这辆车里面有安全带
I wish there were seat belts on this thing.

483
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,520
你还担心这种无聊的事情？
You're worried about seat belts?

484
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,360
哇！ 啊！
-Whoa!  Ah!

485
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,900
小心
Watch it.

486
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,250
汉娜  我看到
-Hannah. -I know.

487
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,780
刹车 快刹车   不 别
-Pull the brake, pull the brake. -No, don't.

488
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,150
我们来不及刹车的
We won't make it.

489
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,330
耶
Yeah.

490
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,990
做得好  谢了
Hey, great job. Thanks.

491
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,300
糟了  小贤 坐稳了
 Guys. Stay put, Sean.

492
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,310
你没事吧 崔佛
Trevor, you okay?

493
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:29,290
汉娜 你的轨道没路了
Hannah, your track ends.

494
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,880
跳过来我这
Jump in my car.

495
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,590
什么？
What?

496
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,890
快  你必须跳过来
Quick, you have to do it.

497
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,060
快跳  我知道
-Just jump. -I know that.

498
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,400
准备  啊！
Ready? Ah!

499
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,380
崔佛  你的轨道也没路了
Trevor, your track ends too.

500
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,140
好吧  你在做什么？
-Okay. -What are you doing?

501
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,150
我在拯救咱们的性命  来
Showing the proper way to save someone's life. Come on.

502
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,520
需要我帮忙吗？  好了
-Can I help? -Okay.

503
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,520
准备
Ready?

504
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,270
你没事吧？  没事
-Are you all right? -Yeah.

505
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,750
幸好有个垫子
Luckily, I had a soft landing.

506
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,650
现在你欠我两个人情了
That's two you owe me now.

507
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,250
谁会去数这些啊？  我会
-Who's keeping count? -I am.

508
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,630
刺激死了
That was awesome.

509
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,630
你们怎么了？  别提了
-What happened to you guys? -Don't ask.

510
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,470
那是什么？
What's that?

511
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,150
你要去哪？  别进去
Where are you going? Don't go in there.

512
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,010
你说什么呢？ 这可能是条出路
 What are you guys talking about? This could be our way out.

513
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,380
墙上开了个洞
There's a hole in the wall.

514
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,460
大家看
Guys, check it out.

515
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,200
红宝石
Rubies.

516
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,090
翡翠
Emeralds.

517
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,860
月长石
Feldspar.

518
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,760
呃  各位 这里还有很多
Uh, guys, there's more.

519
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,480
钻石
Diamonds.

520
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,780
爽爆了
Bling.

521
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:48,260
矿石结晶通常都是形成在
Crystals are frequently formed and found...

522
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:53,360
火山通道里面
...in volcanic tubes.

523
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,540
这条通道能引导我们回去 对吗？
This tube could take us back up, right?

524
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,770
嗯哼  我们离地面不远了吧
-Uh-huh. -We're not far from the surface.

525
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,640
嗯哼  出去之后我要买一辆玛莎拉蒂汽车
-Uh-uh. -When we get out, I'm getting a Maserati.

526
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:12,050
钱不是唯一重要的东西  小贤  还有其他同样重要的东西 性命
Money is not the only thing that matters, Sean. People matter too, you know.

527
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,660
还有诸如此类的    如果你能拥有一辆玛莎拉蒂就不会这么说了
-Something like that.  Not if you have a Maserati.

528
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,920
你们听到了吗？
Did you guys hear that?

529
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,060
都别动
Nobody move.

530
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,480
不要被我猜中了
Tell me that's not what I think it is.

531
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,140
白云母
Muscovite.

532
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,540
白云母
Muscovite.

533
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,650
什么是白云母？
What's muscovite?

534
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,720
白云母是一种很薄的岩石  有多薄
-Muscovite is a thin type of rock formation. -How thin?

535
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,590
呃  薄到只要重量和压力发生一丝一毫的改变
Well, so thin that the slightest change in weight and pressure...

536
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,430
都会使它崩塌
...can cause it to shatter.

537
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,860
我们正站在一大堆白云母上面
And we're standing on a lot of it.

538
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,530
停  停
Just stop. Stop.

539
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,430
好  它们稳住了
Okay, they're stopped.

540
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,570
你要完全按照来时的路走回去
I need you to walk back exactly the way we came from.

541
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,940
要非常非常平稳 懂吗？
Very, very calmly, okay?

542
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,440
轻轻地走
Tread lightly.

543
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,610
慢慢来  很好
Heel, toe. Doing good.

544
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,150
很好  要非常慢
Doing great. Very slowly.

545
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,380
好  继续
Good. Come on.

546
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,360
就是这样
That's it.

547
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,930
做得好
That's great.

548
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,400
要非常小心  继续走
-Really careful. -Keep going.

549
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,900
不
No!

550
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,480
它比我想象的要厚一些
It's actually thicker than I thought.

551
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,900
我们还在往下掉！
We're still falling!

552
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,990
崔佛  书上是怎么说的？
Trevor, what's at the bottom?

553
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,990
呃  如果凡尔纳写的是真的话
Well, if what Verne wrote was right...

554
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,850
这些通道有成百上千公里的深度
...these tunnels could go for hundreds, thousands of miles.

555
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,320
凡尔纳写的是小说
Verne was not right.

556
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,330
崔佛继续说  书上还说了什么？
Trevor, finish. What's at the bottom?

557
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,520
然后就没有然后了
Most likely theory is that it just ends.

558
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,030
没了？  有没有其他可能性？
Ends? Got any other theories?

559
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,190
通道的墙壁有可能被
Well, the walls of this tunnel could have gently eroded...

560
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,340
经过其表面的水所侵蚀
...by water which still runs through it...

561
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:47,600
这些水可以缓冲我们的下坠
...providing a gradual break to our fall.

562
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,680
有点像一条水滑道  水滑道
-Kind of like a water slide. -Water slide.

563
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,250
好  这个可能性我喜欢
Okay, that's a theory.

564
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:56,540
但是这些水有没有可能形成石笋刺穿我们？
But wouldn't the water have formed stalagmites pointing straight up at us?

565
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,020
我们会变成人肉串   那也是一种可能性
-We'll be skewered. -That is also possible.

566
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,900
这是水吗？
Is that water?

567
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,470
对 是水
Yes. Water.

568
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,340
水滑道  水滑道
Water slide, water slide.

569
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,810
它要来了  稳住
Here it comes. Hang on.

570
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,740
小贤！小贤！
Sean! Sean!

571
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,690
小贤  你没事吧？
Sean, Sean, you all right?

572
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,650
我们没有变成人肉串
We didn't get skewered.

573
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,760
游到岩石上
Make for the rocks.

574
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,400
汉娜呢？
Where's Hannah?

575
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,630
汉娜！汉娜！
Hannah! Hannah!

576
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,810
我的背包太重了
My backpack was too heavy.

577
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,970
谢谢
Thank you.

578
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,410
现在的比分是多少了？
So where does that put us now?

579
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,640
相差一分
Back to one.

580
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,190
我们在哪？
Guys, where are we?

581
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,590
那些是星星吗？
Are those stars?

582
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,590
不
No.

583
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,500
那只是山洞的顶部
That's just the ceiling of the cave.

584
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:32,200
是我眼花呢  还是说那个顶部
Is it just me, or is the cave ceiling...

585
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,770
在动？
...moving?

586
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,440
对
Yeah.

587
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,110
好像确实在动
It does look like it...

588
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,720
对吧
...doesn't it?

589
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,340
是小鸟
They're birds.

590
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,140
电子雀？
Electric birds?

591
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,870
它们好像是荧光鸟
They look like Cyanis rosopteryx.

592
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:18,350
只有它们能够进行生物发光  就像是萤火虫
Only they're bioluminescent, like fireflies or glowworms.

593
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,540
真是难以置信
It's incredible.

594
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,730
帅
Cool.

595
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,170
荧光的……鸟
Glow... birds.

596
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,910
你以前见到过这些生物吗？
Have you seen these creatures before?

597
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,180
在博物馆见过  但那些都是化石
Yeah, in the museum, but they were fossilized.

598
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:52,580
这些生物在一千五百万年前就灭绝了
These things have been extinct for over 150 million years.

599
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,430
它们去哪？  嘿  有条通道
Where are they going? Hey, a tunnel.

600
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,130
大家快来
Guys, come on.

601
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,970
小贤  等我一下
Sean, wait. Wait for me.

602
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:45,900
各位尊贵的来宾  欢迎来到地球核心
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the center of the Earth.

603
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:51,440
麦斯是对的
Max was right.

604
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,050
他说的没错
He was right.

605
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:59,180
麦斯是对的！
Max was right!

606
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,160
你爸爸是对的
Your dad was right.

607
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,680
他是对的
He was right.

608
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,530
汉娜 你父亲也是对的
Hannah, your dad was right too.

609
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,990
即使别人都跟他们说
They both believed...

610
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,620
这是不可能的  但他们仍然坚信自己的观点
...in something that everyone told them was impossible.

611
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,790
他是对的
He was right.

612
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:21,270
那上边的光球是什么？  我不知道
-What's that light up there? I can't tell.

613
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:27,350
可能是一种能自行发光的气团
It must be some sort of luminescent gas combination.

614
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,650
我不确定
I don't know.

615
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,620
有点像一个容器
It's like a terrarium.

616
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:36,020
一个埋在地壳底下数千公里的容器
A terrarium thousands of miles beneath the crust of the Earth.

617
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:43,290
一个小世界
A world within the world.

618
00:43:55,340 --> 00:44:00,210
水花的声音从老远就能听到
"The waterfalls, which for a long time, could be heard flowing from afar...

619
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:04,080
古老的瀑布沿着峡谷的峭壁
...now cascaded along the towering canyon walls...

620
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,690
永不止息地流淌
...streaming along the rock with no end."

621
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:09,490
这跟书里面莱登伯格所描述的一样
I mean, it's the same thing Liedenbrock wrote.

622
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,690
你是说  莱登伯格这个小说人物是真有其人？
Are we saying that Liedenbrock the character was real?

623
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,020
他真的存在？
That he existed?

624
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,720
有人来到这里  然后发现了这一切
Someone came down here. Someone saw all this.

625
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,770
然后出去了  最后告诉给凡尔纳
Someone got out and someone told Verne.

626
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,700
有人出去了？
Somebody got out?

627
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,930
这是我今天听过最爽的话
That's the best thing I've heard all day.

628
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,200
难道这一切没有让你大开眼界吗？
Doesn't this just completely blow your mind?

629
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,860
确实是大开眼界
My mind is blown, yes.

630
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,940
巨型石化蘑菇
Enormous fossilized mushrooms.

631
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,880
像是一种极其巨大的真菌
Sort of like humongous fungus.

632
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:14,610
难道书里的一切都是真的？  很有可能
-Everything in the book is real? -Probably.

633
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:17,730
包括那些危险的情节？  我也在担心这个
-And the really dangerous parts? -I was thinking about that too.

634
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:19,190
好吧
Right.

635
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:21,850
崔佛 快来
Trevor, come quick.

636
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,330
小贤？  小贤？
-Sean? -Sean?

637
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,790
我要进去了    等 等一下
-I'm going in. -Yeah, wait up.

638
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:52,320
喂  别着急
Hey, slow down.

639
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,150
我等下再过去
I'll be right there.

640
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:22,420
好像有人住在这里？
Someone actually lived here?

641
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,530
这个人
That somebody...

642
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:28,090
就是莱登伯格
...was Liedenbrock.

643
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:32,100
看看他的这些工具
Look at all his gear.

644
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:35,000
这些工具的制作方法都是
All this, state of the art...

645
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,630
一个世纪前的工艺
...a century ago.

646
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
“麦斯”

647
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:37,990
崔佛
Hey, Trevor.

648
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,360
我想我找到了莱登伯格的笔记本
I think I found Liedenbrock's notebook.

649
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,830
看
Look.

650
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:48,970
上面画的好像是  在树林的另一边有一个地底湖
Looks like on the other side of those trees there's some sort of underground ocean.

651
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,700
对
Yeah.

652
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,080
但我觉得这不是莱登伯格的笔迹
I don't think that's Liedenbrock's handwriting.

653
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,390
是我爸的笔迹
It's my dad's.

654
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,580
崔佛？
Trevor?

655
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,500
崔佛？
Trevor?

656
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,300
我能跟你聊聊吗？
Can I talk to you for a minute?

657
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:15,490
到外面来
Out here.

658
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:18,070
你在这等我好吗？
Can you wait here for a minute?

659
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,720
我想我找到麦斯了
Hey, I think I found Max.

660
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:18,400
我从来没有机会去了解他
I never really got a chance to know him.

661
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:24,390
我真希望能有这么个机会
I mean, I wish I did.

662
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:28,680
他写了一段话  我想让你听听
He wrote something and I want you to hear it.

663
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:35,610
九七年 八月 十四日
"August 14, 1997.

664
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:38,510
今天是小贤的生日
Today was Sean's third birthday.

665
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,490
六个星期之前  我打算在这个时候
Six weeks ago, I promised myself I would be home in time...

666
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,590
送他一对棒球手套
...to give him his first baseball glove.

667
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,620
现在恐怕
Now I'm worried...

668
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,730
我已经没这样的机会了
...that I'll never get the chance.

669
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:05,110
我来这里是为了找到这个神奇的世界  将这个发现与崔佛以及全世界分享
I set out to make an incredible discovery to share with Trevor and the world.

670
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,250
但是现在  我愿意放弃这一切
But now, I would trade it all...

671
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:12,980
我只想看着你长大
...just to be able to watch you grow up...

672
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:17,110
成为一个勇敢 有担当的男子汉
...to be the brave and caring man...

673
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:20,350
我相信你一定不会让我失望的
...I am certain you will become.

674
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,960
生日快乐  小贤
Happy birthday, Sean.

675
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,730
我爱你
I love you.

676
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:31,770
爹爹
Daddy."

677
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,920
永别了  麦斯
Goodbye, Max.

678
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,430
别难过
Come on.

679
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:22,920
按照麦斯的笔记
According to Max's journal...

680
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:28,550
我们所处的这个地方被熔岩包围着
...we're here in this giant air pocket that's surrounded by lava.

681
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:32,360
每隔一段时间就有地震发生
And during periods of intense seismic activity...

682
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:38,230
就像现在这样  对
-Like the one we're in now. -That's right.

683
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,830
包围我们的岩浆
-The magma that surrounds us...

684
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:44,170
会慢慢地将这个地方变成一个巨型烤箱
...turns this place into pretty much just a big oven.

685
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:46,580
这就是我爸爸的遭遇吗？
Was that what happened to my dad?

686
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,150
听着  我知道我只是个孩子  但我能承受的了  相信我
Look, I know I'm just a kid, but I can handle this, really.

687
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,160
坐
Sit down.

688
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,790
麦斯设计了一个逃跑方案
Max was planning an escape.

689
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,630
他的笔记写道  这里的温度能轻易达到二百摄氏度
His notes say that temperatures down here can easily hit 200 degrees.

690
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,200
人类最多只能承受一百五十摄氏度
 A human being can't survive beyond 135.

691
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:11,860
现在已经九十五度了  我们刚到这的时候是八十二度
-It's already 95 degrees. -It was 82 when we got here.

692
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,370
温度上升得很快  那我们怎么做？
-Temperature's rising quickly. -So, what do we do?

693
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,480
我认为我们要遵照麦斯的方案
I say that we follow Max's plan.

694
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:18,170
他是这样写的
Here's what he wrote:

695
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:20,340
根据凡尔纳的小说
"My analysis of the original Verne text...

696
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,980
我相信向北横渡整个地下海洋之后
...leads me to believe that across the ocean due north of my current position...

697
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:28,680
会找到一条类似喷泉的河流  它可以带我回到地面
...is a geyser-like river which could be used to return to the surface."

698
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,260
所以  我们要横渡这个地下海洋
 So, what we have to do is get across this ocean...

699
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:35,490
然后找到那个喷泉  回到地面
...and find the geyser and just hitch a ride topside.

700
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,860
听起来不错
Topside sounds good.

701
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,560
实际操作起来会复杂一点
It's a little trickier than that.

702
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,930
如果温度太热的话  河流就会蒸发
It could get so hot that the water'll evaporate.

703
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,800
我们还有多少时间？
How much time do we have?

704
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:45,060
四十八小时  最多七十二小时
Forty-eight hours. Seventy-two, tops.

705
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:47,840
可能更少
Probably less.

706
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:50,100
好  那么现在的问题是
Okay, so the question is:

707
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,640
怎样才能以最快速度横渡海洋？
What is the fastest way to get across the ocean?

708
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:55,440
我们不可能从陆地绕过去  因为……
There's no way we can get around it, because if we hike...

709
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,880
对  我们不够时间
Oh, we don't have time.

710
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:59,110
我们没有时间这样做
There's no time to do that.

711
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,920
书上都写着
It's all in the book.

712
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,700
嘿  你还好吗？
Hey, you all right?

713
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:13,530
温度多少了？
What's the temperature doing?

714
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,360
已经一百度了
It is a hundred degrees.

715
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:26,770
小贤 把三叶虫吃掉  这样才有力气干活
 Eat your trilobite, Sean. We gotta keep our strength up.

716
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,910
好孩子
Attaboy.

717
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:35,150
嘿
Hey.

718
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,790
我们需要一个中心船桅吗？
Don't we need a center mast?

719
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,820
不  不需要
No. We don't need it.

720
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:42,160
我们的风力在很高的地方
The wind that we want is way up there.

721
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:45,730
热气流   高处的气流比低处的要快得多
Thermal. It's a lot faster than what we got down here.

722
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,770
做得好  就这样做
Good job. That should just about do it.

723
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:54,100
嘿  有个好东西给你
Hey, I got something for you.

724
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:01,650
这是什么？  指南针
 What is this?  It's a compass.

725
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:02,940
是你爸爸的
It was your dad's.

726
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,550
有一年圣诞节  你妈妈送给他的
I remember the Christmas that your mom gave it to him.

727
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:12,130
她希望你爸爸随时随地都能找到回家的路
She wanted to make sure that he could always find a way back home.

728
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,460
希望它能带你回到她的身边
And maybe it will help you find a way back to her.

729
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,870
谢谢 崔佛    应该的
-Thanks, Trevor. -You got it.

730
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,870
这对我意义深重   对我也是
-It means a lot to me. -Me too.

731
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:33,250
噢 还有一件事要告诉你    在这里  磁极是颠倒的
Oh, there's one thing you should know. Down here, the polarity is reversed.

732
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:35,380
北方其实是南方   南方其实是北方
I mean, north is south, south is north...

733
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:38,780
而我们需要向北穿过海洋
...and we need to bear due north across the sea.

734
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,650
你是说  向南
You mean, south.

735
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,780
聪明
Exactly.

736
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:07,380
好  我们把它拿起来吧
All right, it's starting to pick up now.

737
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,650
好  抓好了   稳稳地抓好了
Okay, hold it. Hold it really steady.

738
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,050
好  好  好
Good, good, good.

739
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:15,510
准备好了吗？  嗯
-Good. Ready?  Yeah.

740
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:17,520
三  二  一  放！
Three, two, one, go!

741
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:21,220
耶  好
-Yeah.  All right.

742
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,420
耶   好
Yeah. All right.

743
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:29,960
太好了
Yeah.

744
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,600
冲啊
Go, go, go.

745
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,940
爽  继续
Yeah. Keep going.

746
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,540
哇 我们启程了
Whoa, we're going, we're going.

747
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,190
喂  等等我啊
Hey, well, can you wait for me?

748
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,290
上来  快 快 快
 Well, get on.  Come on, come on, let's go.

749
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:08,030
它又来了
He's back.

750
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:10,110
嘿  老友
Hey, little guy.

751
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:17,340
看见那些云了吗？
Seen those clouds?

752
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,880
嗯
Yeah.

753
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:23,320
现在我们刚好乘着水流的方向   可以放低一点帆布
The current's pulling us in the direction we wanna go. We should lower the kite.

754
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,890
不可以  现在已经一百零九度了
Can't do that. It's a hundred and nine degrees.

755
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,090
越来越热了
It's getting hotter.

756
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,430
我们要全速前进   不用放低 
We need all the speed we can get. Leave it up.

757
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,660
不过是毛毛细雨
It's just a little storm.

758
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,310
没什么大不了
Ain't no big deal.

759
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,340
下面有东西在移动
Something moving down there.

760
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:53,220
有磷皮  会游泳
Phosphorous and plankton.

761
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,450
就是我们在沙滩上见到的那些生物
It's the same thing we saw back at the beach.

762
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,820
我不确定  有点像巨型浮游生物
I don't know. It looks kind of big for plankton.

763
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:00,930
小贤  这里不是海洋公园  不要探那么出
Sean, we're not at SeaWorld, so back off a little bit.

764
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,360
听到了吗？  好像是一种鱼
-All right? -I think it's some sort of fish.

765
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:15,810
别
No.

766
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,080
他们到处都是
They're everywhere.

767
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:25,340
小贤  我就说我们会去棒球场的
Sean, I told you we'd get to the batting cage.

768
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,850
干掉它们
Batter up.

769
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,890
好  看看你有什能耐
Okay. Let's see what you've got.

770
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,960
好  棒球直击
Yeah. Line drive.

771
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:40,560
你有听到声音吗？
-Sean! -Do you hear something?

772
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:45,030
喂？ 小贤
-Hello? Sean.

773
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:47,040
妈妈？  我们好久没联系了
-Mom? -I think we have a bad connection.

774
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:48,870
妈妈  我听不清楚
Mom, I can't hear you.

775
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,510
你在哪？
Where are you?

776
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,010
崔佛叔叔和我  呃
Uncle Trevor and I, uh...

777
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,710
我们估计是在钓鱼
...we're sort of on a fishing trip and...

778
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,250
玩得开心吗？
Are you having fun?

779
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,390
别  不准这样
Whoa, no, you don't.

780
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,930
崔佛叔叔刚钓到一条大的  小贤？
-Uncle Trevor just caught a really big one. -Sean?

781
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,090
我的手机  小贤  你能反手击球吗？
-My phone. -Sean, do you know how to switch hit?

782
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,700
就位？  好
-Ready?  Yeah.

783
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:15,930
全垒打
Out of the ball park.

784
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,200
小贤   小心
-Sean. -Look out.

785
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,430
让我来  让我来
I got it, I got it.

786
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,010
小贤  别 别
 Sean.  No, no, don't.

787
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,120
不要靠近边缘
Get away from the sides.

788
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,250
看它们在做什么
Look what they're doing.

789
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,620
它们对我们没兴趣  它们只想吃鱼
They don't want us. They want the fish.

790
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:41,090
听好了小贤  你去控制方向  我们要改变航道
Listen up. Sean, you take the tiller, we'll get the line.

791
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,660
汉娜  抓住那条绳子
Hannah, hold the slack.

792
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:44,700
小贤  右满舵
Sean, you wanna take us hard starboard?

793
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:46,330
啥？
What?

794
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,590
这边
That way.

795
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:53,070
快
Come on.

796
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,940
好   做得好
-Okay.  Doing good.

797
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:00,850
慢慢离开它们  慢慢地
Now just let it out gently. Let it out gently.

798
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,180
慢慢驶过去
Let it out slowly.

799
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:03,720
成功了
It's working.

800
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:06,410
咱们摆脱它们了
We're pulling clear of them.

801
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,560
真有你的  崔佛叔叔
You're the man, Uncle Trev.

802
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:16,600
那当然  周围的人都这么说我
That's what I've been telling the scientific community for years.

803
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,400
汉娜
Hannah.

804
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,130
我看看
Let me see.

805
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,470
绳子
The lines.

806
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,090
抓到了  小贤
 Got it.  Sean.

807
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,290
小贤  别那样  别
Sean, don't do that. No, Sean.

808
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:52,590
小贤
Sean!

809
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,270
不  小贤！  崔佛！
-No, Sean! -Trevor!

810
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,770
小贤！  坚持住！
-Sean!  Hang on!

811
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:02,400
别放手！
Don't let go!

812
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,750
不
No.

813
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,280
崔佛？
Trevor?

814
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,980
崔佛？
Trevor?

815
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:21,780
有人吗？
Hello?

816
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:26,190
有人吗？
Hello?

817
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:29,560
嗨  老友 这是哪里？
Hey, little guy. Where are we?

818
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,930
你知道哪里能找到水吗？
Hey, do you know where I can get some water?

819
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:40,070
我居然跟鸟说话
I'm talking to a bird.

820
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,370
我一定是傻了
I must be losing it.

821
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,450
小贤！
Sean!

822
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:02,350
小贤！
Sean!

823
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:07,830
停
Wait.

824
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:13,970
风把他往这个方向吹
The wind blew him this way.

825
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:17,370
我们是在往北走吗？
We still heading north?

826
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:20,400
对  没错
Yeah, still north.

827
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:22,550
他很聪明  他知道要怎么做
He's a smart kid. He knows the plan.

828
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,280
我相信他会去那条河找我们的
I'm sure he'll be waiting by the river.

829
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,120
我们去找河吧
Let's find that river.

830
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:36,460
喂  等一下
Hey, come on, wait up.

831
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:44,800
你去哪了？
Where'd you go?

832
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,570
好样的
Good job.

833
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:00,780
好了
Okay.

834
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:04,010
现在怎么走？
Now which way?

835
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:11,130
南
South.

836
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:12,490
很好
That's good.

837
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:14,570
那条河在北方
The river's north.

838
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:16,830
好
Okay.

839
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,570
来  我来拿这个
Here, let me take that.

840
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,730
不用  我没事   来吧  让我来拿
-No, no, I'm fine. -Come on, let me take it.

841
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:25,970
崔佛  我没事    汉娜 汉娜  我来 
-Trevor, I'm fine. -Hannah, Hannah, I got it.

842
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:29,040
我们休息一下吧
Let's just stop for a second.

843
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,690
我们一定会找到他的
Hey, we're gonna find him.

844
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:45,090
喝吧
Drink that.

845
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:48,500
就剩下这些水了？  对
-Is that the last of the water? -Yeah.

846
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:50,140
我们以后还要用  先留着吧
We're gonna need that. Keep it.

847
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,360
汉娜  喝吧
Hannah, drink it.

848
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,140
喝吧
Come on.

849
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,550
趴下！
Duck!

850
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:12,880
我勒个……  这是什么东西？
-What the...?  What was that?

851
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,900
大型肉食性植物？
Large carnivorous plant?

852
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:19,730
汉娜
Hannah.

853
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,090
汉娜？
Hannah?

854
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,130
汉娜
Hannah.

855
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:25,600
汉娜
Hannah.

856
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:31,840
汉娜
Hannah.

857
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,710
啊
Ugh.

858
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:55,230
坚持住
Hang in there.

859
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:03,900
这次我得一分  对吧？
That's one point for me, right?

860
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,310
对
Right.

861
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,740
谁会去数这些  对吧？
Who's keeping track, right?

862
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,960
我懂了
I get it.

863
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:56,260
这是一个磁场
It's a magnetic field.

864
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,990
不是吧
No way.

865
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,320
漂浮石？
Magnetic rocks?

866
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,950
别 别 别
No, no. No, no, no.

867
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:25,640
坑爹啊
No. No.

868
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:54,430
你不用翅膀来试试
You try that without wings.

869
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:09,750
就是那条河
That's the river.

870
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,590
喷泉一定在那个山洞里
Geyser must be inside that cave.

871
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:18,790
小贤！
Sean!

872
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:29,770
他在哪？
Where is he?

873
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:32,440
他 在 哪？
Where is he?

874
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:51,300
崔佛？
Trevor?

875
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:56,790
崔佛？
Trevor?

876
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:25,160
我真后悔没有读过那本书
Man, I really wish I'd read that book.

877
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,460
我看不到他
I don't see him anywhere.

878
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:10,600
崔佛？ 崔佛
Trevor? Trevor.

879
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:12,540
等一下   你想做什么？
Hang on a minute. What are you doing?

880
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,780
我要去找我的侄子
I'm going to get my nephew.

881
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,210
汉娜
Hannah.

882
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:23,050
一切都是我的错
This is all my fault.

883
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:25,290
你先逃吧
Save yourself.

884
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:27,660
回家去
Just go home.

885
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:30,860
我会在河那里等你
I'll wait for you at the river...

886
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:33,520
等到不能等为止
...for as long as I can.

887
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:42,040
你这是为什么？
What did you do that for?

888
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:47,310
以防万一
Just in case.

889
01:12:57,150 --> 01:12:59,620
小贤！
Sean!

890
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:01,980
小贤！
Sean!

891
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:22,540
小贤！
Sean!

892
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,740
小贤？！
Sean?!

893
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,640
小贤！
Sean!

894
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:32,520
小贤！
Sean!

895
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,480
小贤！小贤！
Sean! Sean!

896
01:13:58,180 --> 01:13:59,610
来！
Come on!

897
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:04,750
天啊   见到你真好
Oh, God, I'm glad to see you.

898
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:05,940
我也是
Yeah, you too.

899
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,210
没事吧？   嗯
-Are you all right? -Yeah.

900
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:09,580
快走
We should go.

901
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,290
等一下
Wait, wait, wait.

902
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:15,430
那里是喷泉吗？   对  是我们的目的地
-Is that the geyser? -Yeah, that's where we're going.

903
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:18,990
快
Come on.

904
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:23,830
你以前见过恐龙吗？   骨头就见过
-Haven't you ever seen a dinosaur before? -Not with skin on it.

905
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,740
它太快了   我们跑不过的
He's too fast. We're not gonna make it.

906
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,950
崔佛 你要做什么？   那里有白云母
-Trevor, what are you doing? -That's muscovite.

907
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,210
就是之前让我们掉下来的那种东西
Same thing that we fell through before.

908
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:44,220
不可以   那东西承受不了你
There's no way it's gonna hold you.

909
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:46,690
更承受不了它   你只管跑
It can't hold him either. Now you run.

910
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:48,830
崔佛 别
Trevor, no.

911
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:53,690
它们没有裂  崔佛
It's not breaking, Trevor.

912
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:55,860
继续跑！
Keep running!

913
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:00,840
它要追上你了   我知道
-He's gaining on you. -I know.

914
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:03,070
别停下
Keep going.

915
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:06,010
啊！哇
Ah! Whoa.

916
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:09,810
崔佛 开始裂了
Trevor, it's working.

917
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,860
小心！
Look out!

918
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:29,600
崔佛！
Trevor!

919
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:38,740
我想起来了   我最讨厌野外调查
I just remembered something. I hate field work.

920
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,070
崔佛  来
Trevor, come on.

921
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,380
这个……  你这次有点……
That was like... And then you were like...

922
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:48,780
我知道   这次真幸运
Yeah, I know. I'm really lucky.

923
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,650
好了  这边
Okay, that way.

924
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:54,280
好像不太好    那里更糟
That, no good. That, worse.

925
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:56,090
咱们走
Let's go.

926
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:06,470
是河   我们怎么去到喷泉那里？
The river. How are we gonna get to the geyser?

927
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,900
水在沸腾   我们需要能漂浮的东西
-Water's boiling. -We need something that floats.

928
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,670
随便都可以   我们可以找个木头或者
Anything. I could use a log or...

929
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:13,040
我们需要一条船
What we really need is a boat.

930
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:26,990
谁又勃起了？
Who had dibs again?

931
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,190
快   跳进来
Come on, jump in.

932
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:34,530
这是地球上最好的登山向导   同感
-The best mountain guide on the planet. -Got that right.

933
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:40,130
你不会真以为我会自己逃跑吧？
You didn't really think you were gonna scare me away, did you?

934
01:16:40,610 --> 01:16:42,940
我还没那么容易被吓倒
You'll have to work harder than that.

935
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:55,680
我想我得多收你一些额外的费用了
I'm afraid I'll have to charge you extra for this bit.

936
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:58,050
我能开个收据吗？ 哇
Can I open a tab? Whoa.

937
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:01,180
什么情况？
What was that?

938
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:04,690
真糟糕   这是河床
It's not good. That's the river bed.

939
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,660
水都蒸发掉了
We're running out of water.

940
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,530
各单位注意   抓稳了
Well, guys, you might wanna hang on to something.

941
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:14,000
这次的旅行可能会有点
This ride is about to get a little bit...

942
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,980
颠簸
Bumpy.

943
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:29,080
大家都没事吧？   嗯
-Is everybody all right?  Yeah.

944
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:31,160
我们在哪？
Where are we?

945
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,120
下面的光是什么？
What's that light down there?

946
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:36,900
那是熔岩
That's lava.

947
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:40,060
岩浆在不断升高
It's magma, and it's rising.

948
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:43,460
这条通道本来是有水的    水蒸气会向上喷射
There's supposed to be water in this tunnel. Steam, water shooting up.

949
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,940
我们太迟了   错过了喷泉
We're too late for the geyser, we missed it.

950
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:48,700
那怎么办？   你有没有什么办法 教授？
-What do we do? -Do you have any suggestions, professor?

951
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,900
没有水就没有蒸汽    没有蒸汽我们就哪也去不了
Without water, no steam. Without steam, we're not going anywhere.

952
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,670
这个地方好像已经两三个小时没有水经过了
This place looks like there hasn't been water here in two, three hours now.

953
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:58,910
但是墙壁还是湿的   不可能  现在已经一百三十度了
-But the walls are still wet. -That's impossible, it's 130 degrees.

954
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:00,520
崔佛   怎么了？   看你后面
-Trevor. Behind you. -What?

955
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,920
湿的
It is wet.

956
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:07,920
很冰凉   有水在后面
It's cold. There's water behind here.

957
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:11,000
一定是有暗流或者地下河
There's gotta be water behind some pocket or underground river.

958
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,460
崔佛  岩浆越来越近了
Trevor, it's getting closer.

959
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:16,260
这是镁
Hey, that's magnesium.

960
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:21,700
我们在下滑   你还有多少信号弹？
-We're slipping. -How many flares you got left?

961
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,640
三个   你想用来做什么？
Three. What do you wanna do with them?

962
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:30,650
我要点燃镁矿
Gonna light the magnesium. On purpose.

963
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,210
小心了
Hang on.

964
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:40,590
快着   太湿了
Oh, come on. It's too wet.

965
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:47,430
要往下一点   再给我一个
Got to get further down. Give me another one.

966
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,170
拉住我的腿
Hold my legs.

967
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:57,500
快着
Come on.

968
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,180
你们要绑住我   我要再往下面一点
You're gonna have to tie me off. I gotta get down lower.

969
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:06,880
崔佛  岩浆又近了
Trevor, it's getting closer.

970
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:10,150
那更好   来 准备
That's good. All right, ready.

971
01:19:13,930 --> 01:19:15,620
最后一个
It's the last one.

972
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:33,550
小心啊 崔佛
Trevor, be careful.

973
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,680
怎样？   再下点
 How's that?  Little more.

974
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:40,380
捉紧
Hurry.

975
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,320
还要低吗？   低一点
 Lower?  Little more.

976
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,120
好   稳住
Okay, hold off.

977
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,460
拜托  拜托
-Come on.  Come on.

978
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:53,620
拜托  快点着   拜托
 Come on, light.  Come on.

979
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:56,560
加油  崔佛
Come on, Trevor.

980
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:59,100
还是太湿   我要把它扔到对面
Still wet. Gonna have to throw it to the other side.

981
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,790
什么？
What?

982
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:21,350
别
No.

983
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:23,090
我去！
No!

984
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,330
崔佛  回来
Trevor, come on.

985
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,600
崔佛  回来   它着了  它点着了
-Trevor, come on. -It's lit, it's lit.

986
01:20:32,770 --> 01:20:34,000
拉！
Pull!

987
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:35,570
拉我上去   快点
-Pull me up. -Hurry.

988
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:36,900
拉我上去   拉我上去
Pull me up. Pull me up.

989
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:40,040
快  拉起来    拉
 Come on, pull it. Pull it.  Pull.

990
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:42,880
小心牙齿   小心牙齿
Watch the teeth. Watch the teeth.

991
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:45,040
小贤！快！
Sean! Come on!

992
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:46,450
趴下  它要爆炸了
Get down, it's gonna blow.

993
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:00,260
这东西在变热
This thing's heating up.

994
01:21:00,430 --> 01:21:02,030
我知道！
I know!

995
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:13,280
抓稳！  我已经抓稳了！
-Hang on! -Trust me, I'm hanging on!

996
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,750
那是天空吗？
Is that sky?

997
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:33,160
大家都抓稳了！
Hang on, everybody!

998
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:35,730
你好吵啊！  我情不自禁就说出来了！
-Stop saying that! -It just keeps coming up!

999
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,790
那是维苏威火山
That's Mount Vesuvius.

1000
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:31,690
小贤   如果你妈妈问起你这个周末去哪了
Hey, Sean, if your mom asks you what you did this weekend...

1001
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:35,850
你就告诉她崔佛叔叔带你去意大利了    意大利？
...you tell her Uncle Trevor took you to Italy. -Italy?

1002
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:55,010
小贤？
Sean?

1003
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:56,210
小贤？
Sean?

1004
01:22:58,450 --> 01:23:00,510
怎么了？ 我不过是收集了一点点地质样本
What? I just took a few geological samples.

1005
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:02,250
这叫一点点？
A few geological samples?

1006
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:05,880
好吧  一堆样本   那有什么办法？  我可是科学家的后代啊
A few pounds of samples, but what do you expect? I'm a scientist's son.

1007
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:10,360
看  看
Look. Look.

1008
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:13,060
这个给你
You take this.

1009
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:16,400
你拿   我们抱歉
You take. We are sorry.

1010
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:25,510
你们要再滑一次吗？
You want slide again?

1011
01:23:26,450 --> 01:23:28,180
怎么滑都没问题
Slide is okay. It's fine.

1012
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:30,610
你们想干嘛就干嘛
Anything what you want.

1013
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,390
你这是为什么？
What was that for?

1014
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,590
现在我们扯平了
Now we're even.

1015
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:59,980
雷诺 我回来了    你不用找了
Leonard, I'm back. Stop doing what you're doing.

1016
01:24:00,150 --> 01:24:02,080
我没找什么啊？
What am I doing?

1017
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,050
噢  看   你在找工作
Oh, look, you're looking for work.

1018
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:06,410
没必要找了   因为你已经有工作了
You don't need to, because you have a job...

1019
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:10,220
“格森-安德森”地质勘察协会
...with the Asgeirsson-Anderson Institute for Tectonophysical Exploration.

1020
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:12,720
“格森-安德森”……  啥？
The Asgeirsson-Anderson... What?

1021
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:14,380
名字其实还没想好
Still working on the name.

1022
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,000
一人得道   鸡犬升天
But the point is, rising tide lifts all boats.

1023
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:18,790
太好了
Man, that's awesome.

1024
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:21,130
那个   我是那鸡犬吗？
I think... Am I a boat?

1025
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:24,200
对 没错    我们可以继续搭档了    太好了
-You're a boat. We're back in business. -All right, dude.

1026
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:26,900
喂 喂 喂    这么兴奋什么事情呢？
Well, well, well. What's all the excitement about?

1027
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:28,730
嗨  艾伦  你好啊？  很好
-Oh, hey, Alan. How are you? Good.

1028
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:30,500
你在干嘛？   我吗？
-What you doing? -Oh, me?

1029
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:33,170
我准备搬进我的新实验室
I'm moving into my new lab.

1030
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:35,310
话说回来   你去哪了？
More importantly, where have you been?

1031
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:39,320
我听说你缺席了星期一的演讲   你的学生都在抱怨呢
I heard you missed your Monday lecture and both of your students complained.

1032
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:40,470
哦！
Oh!

1033
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:44,220
我去了趟旅行   毕生难忘
I took a quick vacation. Best thing I could've done.

1034
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:45,450
那真是刺激
That is exciting.

1035
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:47,890
找天跟我讲讲旅行的经过吧？
You'll have to promise to tell me about it, okay?

1036
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:52,230
我可能没有空
但是你可以在《美国科学》上读一读我的论文
Not sure if I'll have time, but you can read about it in Scientific American.

1037
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:55,860
《美国科学》？
Scientific American?

1038
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,560
我只是希望  你不要太羡慕  好吗？
Look, I just want to say, no hard feelings, okay?

1039
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:01,100
关于实验室搬迁以及其他杂物
About the laboratory moving and expansion thing.

1040
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:03,770
我会去找一栋我自己的实验室的
So I'm actually looking for my own building anyway.

1041
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:06,780
你想要怎么找一栋实验室呢？
How exactly are you going to do that, Trevor?

1042
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:10,010
呃   你可以理解为我踩狗屎运了
Well, let's just say I fell into a small fortune.

1043
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:14,780
明天你要去加拿大了？
 So tomorrow you're gonna be a Canadian.

1044
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:17,250
对   没错
Yep. Looks that way.

1045
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:26,030
我觉得这次相聚太短暂了
I'd say that was a lot of male bonding packed into very little time.

1046
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,570
下次我们一起玩几个星期  怎么样？
What do you say we take a couple weeks next time?

1047
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:31,200
几个星期？
A couple weeks?

1048
01:25:31,370 --> 01:25:33,840
圣诞假期你有安排吗？   没有  我很闲
-What are you doing over Christmas break? -Nothing. I'm free.

1049
01:25:34,010 --> 01:25:36,130
我刚从你爸的东西里找到这个
I just found this in your dad's stuff.

1050
01:25:37,010 --> 01:25:38,170
读一下
Give it a read.

1051
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:40,340
《迷失帝国-亚特兰蒂斯》？   嗯
-"Lost City of Atlantis."  Mm-hm.

1052
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,070
再约吧
We'll talk.

1053
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:46,240
小贤 那是什么？
Sean, what is that?

1054
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:49,050
我在喂我的宠物   什么宠物？
-I'm just feeding my pet. -What pet?

1055
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:51,190
小贤
Sean.

1056
01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:53,980
你觉得我妈妈会让我养他嘛？   我怎么知道
-You think my mom will let me keep him? -I don't know.

1057
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:56,250
他肯不肯被养都成问题
Might not even stay here.

1058
01:25:56,430 --> 01:25:58,230
你看   嘿 回来
-Look at it. -Hey, come on.

1059
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,590
这就是你的问题了    你要去哪？
-This is your problem. -Where are you going?

1060
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:03,900
我这里有好吃的    回来   快下来
I got some food for you. Come on. Come back down here.

1061
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,660
回来
Come on.

1062
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:17,000
