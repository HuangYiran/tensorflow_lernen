混乱之子 前情提要
<i>Previously on Sons of Anarchy...</i>

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,931
你想把我们交给公众审判吗？
You trying this in the court of public opinion, Counselor?

3
00:00:05,014 --> 00:00:08,675
我可不能控制媒体的观点和看法
I have no control of what the press gets ahold of or how they spin it.

4
00:00:08,754 --> 00:00:09,535
是啊
Right.

5
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,467
为了摆脱牢狱之灾
Giving up the Sons of Anarchy is going to be

6
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:14,357
有人很愿意把混乱之子帮会供出来
a very popular get-out-of-jail-free card.

7
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:15,833
你和Lowen在搞什么鬼？
What are you doing with Lowen?

8
00:00:16,038 --> 00:00:16,859
你要和Jax离婚？
You divorcing Jax?

9
00:00:16,915 --> 00:00:18,915
你打算在监护人的事情上造反吗？
You planning on some kind of custody coup?

10
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:20,917
我对家人干嘛不关你的事
What I do with my family is none of your business.

11
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:21,918
婊子
Bitch!

12
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:23,553
老天
Jesus!

13
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:24,554
搞什么鬼？
What the hell?

14
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:25,522
我的宝贝
My baby!

15
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:26,556
看你干的好事
Look what you did.

16
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:27,524
哦 不是我干的
Oh, I didn't do that.

17
00:00:27,526 --> 00:00:28,525
不 就是你干的
Yes, you did.

18
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:29,559
我们都亲眼所见
We all saw it.

19
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:30,527
把她带走
Take her out of here.

20
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:32,562
你打算拿Gemma怎么办？
What are you gonna do about Gemma?

21
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:34,931
禁止令会让她离你和孩子们远远的
Restraining order keeps her away from you and the boys.

22
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:37,748
把事情搞得一团糟 让我心伤透了 
It breaks my heart that you had to become something

23
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:39,446
你却认为这样做是对的
so wrong to do what you thought was right.

24
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:41,471
我这样做 是为了保护我的孩子 Wayne
I did it to protect my kids, Wayne.

25
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:43,440
我再也不会帮你了
I can't help you no more.

26
00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:44,474
需要点什么吗 朋友
Need anything, friend?

27
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:45,475
是的 也许吧
Yeah, maybe.

28
00:00:45,477 --> 00:00:47,477
我想你会喜欢这个
I think you'll like this one.

29
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,446
47页的内容非常精彩
It gets real good around page 47.

30
00:00:49,448 --> 00:00:50,480
发生什么事？
What's going on?

31
00:00:50,482 --> 00:00:52,282
Patterson 早上把我弄到她的办公室
Patterson pulled me into her office this morning.

32
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:53,250
是关于那个头条新闻的事？
About the headline?

33
00:00:53,252 --> 00:00:54,885
她要把我毁了 小伙子 她威胁说
She's crushing me, kid;she's threatening to

34
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:57,888
要把港口归到郡长的管理下 这可是挡了大家的财路
bring in the sheriffs to police the port,
and that steps on everybody's game.

35
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,956
我打算交待那把枪的来源
I'm ready to give up the source of the KG-9.

36
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,925
那把枪不是Teller提供的
It wasn't Teller who supplied the gun.

37
00:01:01,927 --> 00:01:02,959
是我
It was me.

38
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:04,895
我对那些死去的孩子负责
I'm responsible for the death of those children.

39
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:07,931
要是你还在乎那些孩子 你就应该交待清楚...所有的真相
If you cared about these kids, you'd
tell me everything... the whole truth.

40
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:09,900
我不清楚你打什么主意
I don't know where you're going with this, but I

41
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:11,902
但是 我的律师不在场 我不会吐一个字
ain't saying another word to you without my lawyer.

42
00:01:11,904 --> 00:01:13,904
你不需要律师了
You don't need a lawyer.

43
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:14,971
是Toric杀害了Erin Byrne
Toric killed Erin Byrne.

44
00:01:14,973 --> 00:01:16,606
他可以走了
He's free to go.

45
00:01:16,608 --> 00:01:18,975
你是否后悔过....你回来？
Do you ever regret it... coming back?

46
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:20,977
很多事情 我可能有不同的选择
A lot of things I'd do differently.

47
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:23,647
我只是感觉到 我与你的距离如此遥远
I just feel so far away from you now.

48
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:25,749
让我回到你的心里
Please let me back in.

49
00:02:41,832 --> 00:02:43,933
早安
Good morning.

50
00:02:53,705 --> 00:02:56,405
你回来我好开心
I'm so glad you're home.

51
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:57,913
我也是
Me, too.

52
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:03,546
我去给你弄点咖啡
I'll make you some coffee.

53
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:25,501
谢谢
Thank you.

54
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:27,570
哦
Oh.

55
00:03:46,457 --> 00:03:49,358
希望我们今天别再上头条新闻
Hopefully we didn't make the front page today.

56
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,227
没有
Nope.

57
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:53,896
似乎确实没有
Doesn't look like it.

58
00:03:53,898 --> 00:03:56,398
我才起来没多久
Guess my 15 minutes are up.

59
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,702
我也有条大新闻给你听听
I got my own headline you need to hear.

60
00:03:59,704 --> 00:04:04,507
昨天没告诉你 是不想破坏你刚回来的气氛
Didn't want to tell you last night, step on the homecoming.

61
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:09,478
大新闻？
Front-page-type stuff?

62
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:17,319
发生了什么事？
What's going on?

63
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,555
关于我和Tara的事
It's me and Tara.

64
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:21,657
糟糕透了
Shit happened.

65
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,962
真的想把这一切都告诉我吗？
Are you sure you want to tell me all this?

66
00:04:26,964 --> 00:04:28,564
嗯 是的
Yeah, I do.

67
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:32,568
Clay没有在监狱里被干掉的原因 是因为我们需要他
The reason Clay wasn't killed inside is because we need him.

68
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,839
爱尔兰方面指定他接手在加州的枪支生意
The Irish want him to be point for guns here in Cali.

69
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:40,943
他们打算下周 在他转送途中劫囚车 救他出来
They're gonna take down his transport next week, bust him out.

70
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:43,345
老天
Jesus Christ.

71
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:45,915
哇哦
Wow.

72
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:48,984
是啊 我知道
Yeah, I know.

73
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:53,155
听上去太他妈疯狂了 老妈
That's some crazy-ass shit, Mama.

74
00:04:53,157 --> 00:04:56,692
你有什么证据吗？
Can you prove any of it?

75
00:04:56,694 --> 00:05:00,963
Wendy参与了Tara的勾当
Wendy was in on it with Tara.

76
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:03,032
她现在很内疚
Guilt got to her.

77
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:06,936
我认为她还是会站在我这边的
I think she'll back me up.

78
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:09,622
你是说 一个做父亲的 对于他所爱的人 
You're talking about a father trying to wrap his brain

79
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:11,458
也就是孩子他妈 做出的令人发指的背叛行为
around some seriously heinous

80
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:14,443
而置之不理 宁愿把头埋在沙里
betrayal by the woman he loves, mother of his son.

81
00:05:14,445 --> 00:05:16,946
我认为你需要的证据 不仅仅是一个瘾君子的话
I think you might need more than the word of a junkie.

82
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:19,148
特别是 这个瘾君子是他所厌恶的人
Especially a junkie he hates.

83
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,551
我想你没必要再告诉我其他什么
I don't think you should tell me anything else.

84
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:27,356
我知道 你在做着你想做的事
I know you're doing what you got to do.

85
00:05:27,358 --> 00:05:29,358
让我们彼此的距离疏远
Putting distance between us.

86
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,659
我明白
I get it.

87
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:34,530
昨晚我冥思苦想了一夜 想怎样帮你洗脱那个指控 Tara
I spent all night trying to figure out how
to help you with these charges, Tara.

88
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:36,165
你做不到的
You can't.

89
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:38,067
是啊
Yeah.

90
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:41,537
但是我会保证 作为一个丈夫的承诺
But I can keep my promise as a husband.

91
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:43,138
坦诚相待
To be honest.

92
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,740
这一点以前我没做到
Which I haven't.

93
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:50,079
我一直想保护你 不管任何事情 显然我没有做到
I've been trying to protect you from
everything, which clearly hasn't worked.

94
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:51,814
完全没做到
At all.

95
00:05:51,816 --> 00:05:54,550
现在 我明白了你的苦心 老妈
Now, I know you're trying, Mama.

96
00:05:54,552 --> 00:05:58,254
你身上的麻烦 不应该成为你的负担
The struggle that I'm having with this
shit, that-that ain't your burden.

97
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:01,857
那得感激你没有对我不信任
Thanks for not doubting me.

98
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:07,596
或者至少你没表现出来
Or for at least not showing me that you do.

99
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,600
你心里埋藏着很多秘密 Gem
You got some heavy secrets, Gem.

100
00:06:11,602 --> 00:06:14,770
我能看出来
I see them.

101
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:16,605
我也知道那些秘密的给你的负担
I see the weight of them.

102
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:19,174
它们带走了你的欢乐
How they drain the joy from you.

103
00:06:21,244 --> 00:06:26,682
但是对于孩子们 你从来没有为此编造真相
But your babies... I know that you'd
never spin the truth about that.

104
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,826
我爱你
I love you.

105
00:06:39,763 --> 00:06:41,830
我也爱你
Me, too.

106
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:51,840
记得吗 自从你离开Stockton监狱以后 你就没说过“我爱你”
You know, since you got out of Stockton,
you haven't been able to say "I love you."

107
00:06:53,743 --> 00:06:57,579
我知道 那段经历对你来说很痛苦
I know that must be hard for you.

108
00:06:57,581 --> 00:07:00,582
对不起 我忍不住要告诉你
I'm sorry, I'll stop telling you.

109
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:02,651
告诉你我的感觉
Just know it's what I feel.

110
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:18,518
孤独的骑行在这尘世
Riding through this world  all alone

111
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,642
上帝将灵魂带走
God takes your soul

112
00:07:21,923 --> 00:07:24,910
徒剩躯壳
You're on your own

113
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:27,656
像乌鸦掠过天际
The crow flies straight

114
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:29,818
直飞远方
A perfect line

115
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:34,012
缠绵在恶魔之床
On the devil's path

116
00:07:34,182 --> 00:07:36,101
直至死亡
Until you die

117
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:41,747
才将这一世轨迹
Gotta look this life

118
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:43,539
看个端详
In the eye.

119
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:48,500

早上好
Good morning.

121
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:56,156
我要给你通报一下最新情况 警长
I need to update you, Lieutenant.

122
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:57,276
好的 夫人
Yes, ma'am.

123
00:07:57,278 --> 00:07:59,579
这边请
Here we are.

124
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:01,614
我听说昨晚Padilla昨晚被释放了
I understand that Padilla was released last night.

125
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:04,751
是的
That's right.

126
00:08:04,753 --> 00:08:06,919
她的头发怎么了？
What happened to her hair?

127
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:11,357
那才是她真正的风格
Sister be doing it with the real flow.

128
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:14,827
不明白是什么意思
I don't know what that means.

129
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:20,166
我听说了被害者父亲的遭遇
I heard about what happened to the victim's father.

130
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:21,768
在Stockton自杀了
Suicide in Stockton.

131
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,869
不是从报纸上得知的
Not from the papers.

132
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:25,038
我和住在迪威逊大街的亚历山大聊过
I-I spoke to Alexander at Division Street.

133
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,041
哦
Oh.

134
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:29,475
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:34,147
嗯 非常令人伤感
Yeah, it's very sad.

136
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:36,872
我想我还有部分心存感激
I guess a part of me is grateful...

137
00:08:37,438 --> 00:08:40,505
在我乏味的工作中还有让我意外的事情
that something can still surprise me in this job.

138
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:43,958
让我没有完全变成铁石心肠
Makes me not completely made of stone.

139
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:45,763
暂时还没有
Yet.

140
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,586
我给你调派三个额外的队伍
I'm giving you three extra units.

141
00:08:51,588 --> 00:08:56,257
我要你全天24小时 时刻监视Jax Teller
I want 24/7 surveillance on Jax Teller.

142
00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:00,561
你认为这样动用我们的资源是最好的方式吗？
You think that's really the best use of our resources?

143
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:02,764
夫人 我很了解这帮家伙
Ma'am, I know these guys.

144
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:05,633
自从那个头条新闻出来后 他们完全变得像童子军一样守规矩
After those headlines,they'll go total Boy Scout.

145
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:07,468
不敢越雷池一步
Won't risk any business.

146
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,706
这是考验耐性和持久性的时候
It's about consistency and patience.

147
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:15,810
现在我们把气氛缓和下来 转过身去 眼光放到别处
The minute we ease up, turn our backs, look the other way,

148
00:09:15,812 --> 00:09:19,213
这段时间我们就放任其他惨剧的发生
that's the minute we allow another tragedy to happen.

149
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:25,887
对付这帮家伙来硬的 我没问题 你呢 警长？
You don't have a problem stepping hard 
on these guys, do you, Lieutenant?

150
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,255
不
No.

151
00:09:27,257 --> 00:09:28,623
没问题
I don't.

152
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:29,590
很好
Good.

153
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:31,659
立即开始监视行动
Surveillance begins immediately.

154
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:34,862
很快你就会得到增援
You'll have backup within the hour.

155
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:13,668
弄得很干净啊 Chucky
Looking clean, Chucky.

156
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:15,870
过奖了
Thank you.

157
00:10:15,872 --> 00:10:18,272
这就是为什么你是个怪胎
And that's why you're a freak.

158
00:10:18,274 --> 00:10:19,974
嘿
Hey.

159
00:10:19,976 --> 00:10:21,008
欢迎回来 兄弟
Welcome back, my brother.

160
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,977
嘿 哥们
Hey, buddy.

161
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:25,046
爱尔兰人的生意经念得怎样？
How'd the Irish sales pitch go?

162
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:26,047
还不错 兄弟
Good, man.

163
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:28,382
和我们大多数买家联络上了
Connected with most of our buyers.

164
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:31,953
他们还是希望和Clay打交道 但似乎愿意接受这种转变
They still want to talk to Clay,but they seemed open to change.

165
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:34,055
他们也理解了我们为什么要退出
They get why we're stepping away.

166
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:35,022
很好
Good.

167
00:10:35,024 --> 00:10:37,525
和意大利人不好谈
Couldn't get a sit-down with the Italians.

168
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:41,462
我认为 私人交情变了 和他们就不好打交道
I don't think the personnel change is gonna land too well with them.

169
00:10:41,464 --> 00:10:43,531
爱尔兰人有安排
Irish are setting it up.

170
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:47,802
他们找了监狱内部的人 他能给Clay弄部电话 让他联络
They got someone inside that's gonna get
a phone to Clay, have him reach out.

171
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:49,370
搞定所有买家
Lock down all the buyers.

172
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:50,872
好吧
All right.

173
00:10:50,874 --> 00:10:53,374
他们与Clay联系上以后 你负责跟进
You follow up with everyone after they talk to Clay.

174
00:10:53,376 --> 00:10:54,475
好的
Aye.

175
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,713
早上好
Morning.

176
00:10:58,715 --> 00:11:00,248
不好意思 打扰了
Sorry to interrupt.

177
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,482
哇哦
Wow.

178
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:03,150
你还没死？
You didn't die yet?

179
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:05,186
黄土每天都埋上来一点
A little every day.

180
00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:09,090
见到你真高兴
Good to see you, Chief.

181
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:10,157
嗯 我也是 Bobby
Yeah, you, too, Bobby.

182
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,093
有什么需要吗 队长？
What do you need, Cap-a-tain?

183
00:11:12,095 --> 00:11:15,363
给我几分钟时间 老大
Just a minute of your time there, Pres.

184
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:17,765
嗯 好的
Yeah, okay.

185
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:20,935
告退了 先生们
Excuse us, gentlemen.

186
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:21,936
一会楼上见
I'll see you upstairs.

187
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:23,237
嗯 好的
Yeah, all right.

188
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:25,907
给你来杯咖啡？
Can I get you some coffee?

189
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:28,676
你有 呃 啤酒吗？
You got any, uh, beer back there?

190
00:11:28,678 --> 00:11:31,112
现在就到了泡吧时间？
Miller time already?

191
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:33,915
吃早餐还能要你命呢
Breakfast of terminally-ill champions.

192
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:35,983
过来坐吧
Sit down.

193
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:42,123
嘿 我想告诉你
Hey, I wanted you to know.

194
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,760
Tara说 有你陪着她和孩子们真是太好了
Tara told me how good you've been with her and the boys.

195
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:47,962
近来太多的麻烦事 一直没机会说声“谢谢”
With all the shit going on,haven't had a chance to say

196
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:52,433
真的很感谢你的照顾 朋友
thank you, but appreciate you looking out, man.

197
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:54,201
嗯
Yeah.

198
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:57,204
这是 呃  应该的
It's, uh, no problem.

199
00:11:57,206 --> 00:12:01,309
你真的有个不错的家庭 孩子
You got a real nice family there, son.

200
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:03,377
是啊 有些确实不错
Yeah, some of them.

201
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,715
是啊
Right.

202
00:12:07,717 --> 00:12:10,853
我明白这也许不关我事 但是...
I know it probably ain't none of my business, but...

203
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,603
我比任何人都了解你老妈
I know your mom longer than anybody.

204
00:12:15,354 --> 00:12:19,646
小的时候我们经常吃霸王餐
We used to dine and dash this place when we were kids.

205
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:21,484
是啊 我也是
Yeah, me, too.

206
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:26,734
我知道你很关心她 Wayne
Look, I know you care about my mom, Wayne.

207
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:32,106
可不仅仅是这样 孩子....
It's not just that, son...
老天
Jesus Christ.

208
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:34,508
搞什么？
What the hell?

209
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,178
喂 你到底在干什么？
Hey! What the hell you doing?!

210
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,746
喔.....喔
Whoa... whoa!

211
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:40,448
哦 搞什么？
Oh! What the hell?!

212
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,509



213
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:44,242
该死的
Holy shit!

214
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:50,898



215
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:54,391



216
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:57,401



217
00:12:58,601 --> 00:12:59,501



218
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:01,335
放开我
Let go of me!

219
00:13:01,337 --> 00:13:02,803
你是谁？
Who are you?

220
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:05,272
喂 你为什么要这么干？
Hey! Why'd you do that?

221
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:06,707
强奸啦
Rape!

222
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:07,775
强奸啦
Rape!

223
00:13:07,777 --> 00:13:08,776
开玩笑吧
Seriously?

224
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:09,810
放开我
Let go of me!

225
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:10,644
来人呐...拿开...
Somebody... take...!

226
00:13:10,646 --> 00:13:12,546
好吧 好吧
All right! All right!

227
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,816
发生什么事情？
What's that all about?

228
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:18,853
带上你们的枪和吵死人的摩托滚蛋吧
You need to take your guns and
your loud bikes and just go.

229
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:21,856
你们这帮人都滚出这里
You all need to get out of here.

230
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:22,723
欢迎

很好
Good.

240
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:44,412
多谢各位的光临 先生们
I'd like to thank you all,
gentlemen, for coming today.

241
00:13:44,414 --> 00:13:47,481
你们做了一个正确的选择
You made the right choice.

242
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:52,319
今天读书的内容是约翰福音第八章第三十二节 真理的力量
Today's reading is from John 8:32 on power of truth.

243
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:57,925
请大家打开圣经
Will you all now please open your Bibles.

244
00:13:57,927 --> 00:14:00,594
那是Gary Putner家的孩子
It was Gary Putner's kid.

245
00:14:00,596 --> 00:14:04,098
她从12岁就进出少年管教所
She's been in and out of juvie and rehab since she was 12.

246
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,767
是个问题少年
Got a few problems.

247
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:10,004
是啊 她用水管扳手来反击吧
Yeah. She's working them out with a pipe wrench.

248
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:14,175
为什么是我的车倒霉？
Why my bike?

249
00:14:14,177 --> 00:14:15,276
我是说真的
I mean, really?

250
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:17,078
所有的小姑娘都和我有仇吗？
Do all teenage girls just hate me?

251
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,546
是的
Yes.

252
00:14:18,548 --> 00:14:19,613
是
Yep.

253
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:23,584
哦 是吧
Oh. Yeah.

254
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:25,286
我们认识那个Putner吗？
We know this Putner guy?

255
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:27,421
Clay可能认识
Clay might have.

256
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:31,725
为Oswald干活之前 他是个熟练的技师
He was a journeyman mechanic
before he went to work for Oswald.

257
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:33,894
现在他是厂里设备部的领班
He's an equipment foreman at the mill.

258
00:14:33,896 --> 00:14:38,199
嗯 但是我们和他没什么过节 不怎么记得他
Yeah, but we never had a beef with
the guy... not that I can remember.

259
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:39,767
没有孩子他妈？
No mother?

260
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:40,935
她去世了
She was killed.

261
00:14:40,937 --> 00:14:42,236
车祸
Car accident.

262
00:14:42,238 --> 00:14:46,273
18号公路上 就在孩子出生后不久
Highway 18, just after the kid was born.

263
00:14:46,275 --> 00:14:49,777
可能这就是原因
That might be the connection.

264
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:53,521
那个拖车把你老爸撞了以后 产生连环撞车
It was the pile-up caused by the tractor-trailer,

265
00:14:53,557 --> 00:14:56,311
也就殃及到了她
jackknifed after it hit your dad.

266
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:02,890
这就是说 因为她妈妈的死责怪到我们头上
So she blames us for her mother's death.

267
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:04,959
18年以后的报复？
18 years later?

268
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:06,760
难说
I don't know.

269
00:15:06,762 --> 00:15:08,863
人们往往对悲痛有不同的表达方式
People grieve in strange ways.

270
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:12,633
哦 糟了
Ah, shit.

271
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:14,602
他们是为了那个女孩的事情来的吗？
Think they're here 'cause of the girl?

272
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:16,637
要我去搞清楚吗？
Want me to go find out?

273
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,740
不用 我来
No, I got it.

274
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:26,113
早上好
Morning.

275
00:15:26,115 --> 00:15:28,516
嗯
Yeah.

276
00:15:28,518 --> 00:15:30,684
这儿怎么了？
What happened there?

277
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:32,153
不清楚
I don't know.

278
00:15:32,155 --> 00:15:34,989
很明显有人对这里卖的冰激凌不满意
Clearly someone doesn't like ice cream.

279
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:37,758
对甜品严重过敏的人 是吧？
Extremely lactose intolerant, huh?

280
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,759
很对
That's right.

281
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:40,261


282
00:15:40,263 --> 00:15:44,031
我猜你不是为了我们这破了一块玻璃而来吧
Guessing you're not here about my broken window.

283
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:47,434
不 不是
No, I'm not.

284
00:15:47,436 --> 00:15:51,005
这段时间 你们得置于我们的监视下
You're gonna have a shadow for a little while.

285
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:53,440
这不是我说了算
It's not my call.

286
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:55,843
是Patterson？
Patterson?

287
00:15:55,845 --> 00:16:01,182
她在寻找枪支来源 并且她的疑犯名单上只有一个名字
She's looking for the gun source, and
she only has one suspect on her list.

288
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:03,450
好吧
Okay.

289
00:16:03,452 --> 00:16:05,686
跟踪你们的尾巴肯定会有的
This tail is gonna happen.

290
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:08,622
不要让我们难做 好吗？
Let's not make it ugly, all right?

291
00:16:08,624 --> 00:16:10,724
好吧 我理解
No, I get it.

292
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:12,359
很好
All right.

293
00:16:12,361 --> 00:16:14,428
走了 哥们
Fellas.

294
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:21,135
妈的
Shit.

295
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:25,239
我们新长出来的小尾巴
Our new tail.

296
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:26,840
这可不妙
This is bad, Jackie.

297
00:16:26,842 --> 00:16:30,177
下周我们会很忙很忙
We got a very, very busy week ahead of us.

298
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:32,413
我知道
I know.

299
00:16:32,415 --> 00:16:35,182
找机会我们把那个话题聊完
We need to finish that conversation.

300
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:37,184
下次吧
We will.

301
00:16:37,186 --> 00:16:38,319
好的
All right.

302
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:39,653
Barosky找你
It's Barosky.

303
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:42,156
说有急事
Says it's urgent.

304
00:16:42,158 --> 00:16:44,692
呃 让他来找我们
Well, he's gonna have to come to us.

305
00:16:44,694 --> 00:16:46,427
到Diosa碰头
Diosa.

306
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:47,761
你听见他说了？
You heard him?

307
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:50,431
到Diosa
Diosa.

308
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:53,667
好了 随时给我通报Clay的情况
All right, keep me updated on Clay.

309
00:16:53,669 --> 00:16:55,236
你和Juice 把那姑娘找出来
You and Juice, find the girl.

310
00:16:55,238 --> 00:16:56,770
好
Yeah.

311
00:16:56,772 --> 00:16:59,106
我去见见Charlie
And let's go see Dirty Charlie.

312
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:01,242
Hap 跟我一起去
Hap, come with us.

313
00:17:12,454 --> 00:17:16,857
薪水收入已经转到一个新的账户
Salaried income has been shifted into a new account.

314
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,525
很好
Good.

315
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:20,527
现金怎么办？
What about the cash?

316
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:22,863
保险箱有你们两个人的名字
Safety deposit box is in both your names.

317
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:24,431
现金是他的
Cash is his.

318
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:27,668
我这只是离开 不是把他扫地出门
It's about getting away,not cleaning him out.

319
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:33,140
这个是证人名单
Here's a list of character witnesses.

320
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:34,642
还能想到其他人吗？
Anyone else you can think of?

321
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:36,710
名单人不多啊
That's a short list.

322
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,981
行了 挺好的
No, it's fine.

323
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:50,984
我仔细查看过你的病历
I looked over your medical documentation...

324
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:55,564
怀孕证明 超声波检查报告 医生的签名...
positive pregnancy, ultrasounds, doctor's signatures...

325
00:17:56,932 --> 00:18:01,702
都被关照过....都经Margaret Murphy之手
all expedited... by Margaret Murphy.

326
00:18:06,908 --> 00:18:11,578
利用伪造的病历获得监护权可是重罪
Using false medical records to
substantiate a custody hold is a felony.

327
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,780
我明白
I know that.

328
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:17,518
离开庭还有两周时间
We're two weeks away from standing in front of a jury.

329
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,655
如果你还有什么剧本要演 我现在必须清楚
If there's any more drama you've
got planned, I need to know now.

330
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,128
所有你都知道
You know everything.

331
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,951
于是耶稣对那些信奉他的犹太人说
So Jesus said to the Jews who believed Him,

332
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:34,612
“如果你们遵从我的教导 你们才是我真正的门徒”
"If you abide in my Word,you are truly my disciples."

333
00:18:34,704 --> 00:18:38,038
“你们将掌握真理，只有这个真理让你们得以自由”
"You will know the truth and this truth will set you free."

334
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:43,056
瞧 约翰
See, John...

335
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:46,606
他不是谈及你的或我的真理 他谈及的是上帝的真理
he ain't talking about your truth or my
truth, he's talking about God's truth.

336
00:18:46,682 --> 00:18:48,115
阿门
Amen.

337
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:50,384
作为一个凡人 我们无法掌握真理
As mortal men, we can't know real truth.

338
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:51,618
这是为什么？
And why?

339
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,620
是因为我们是说谎者？
Is it because we are liars?

340
00:18:53,622 --> 00:18:56,390
还是因为我们很邪恶或者不值得信任？
Is it because we are evil or untrustworthy?

341
00:18:56,392 --> 00:18:57,458
不是的
No.

342
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,495
我们之所以是凡人 是因为我们生而有罪
We have the truth of man because
we were born with the sin of man!

343
00:19:01,497 --> 00:19:05,332
这是原罪 兄弟们 就是这原罪让我们看不到上帝和他的真理
It is sin, my brothers, that keeps
us from knowing God and His truth!

344
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:06,500
有道理
That's right.

345
00:19:06,502 --> 00:19:08,068
原罪
Sin!

346
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,072
我们每个人都带着模糊的眼镜
Those dirty glasses that we all wear.

347
00:19:12,074 --> 00:19:18,212
正是这副眼镜 让我们每个人所说的 所做的 都是出于自身考虑
It is what makes everything we say,
everything we do, self-motivated!

348
00:19:18,214 --> 00:19:21,415
这样怎能让我们认知到上帝和他的真理呢？
So how do we get to know God and His truth?

349
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:25,052
如何让我们看到 除了我们自私的欲望之外的东西呢？
How do we see beyond our own selfish desires?

350
00:19:25,054 --> 00:19:28,389
如何让我们得以解脱呢？
How do we set ourselves free?

351
00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:29,656
上帝啊
Jesus.

352
00:19:29,658 --> 00:19:31,759
阿门 上帝啊
Amen, Jesus.

353
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:33,894
阿门 上帝啊
Amen, Jesus!

354
00:19:38,901 --> 00:19:42,269
让我们澄清一些事情 大嘴巴
Let me get something straight, Rev.

355
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:46,707
某个犹太佬被钉在十字架上 就像 呃 我也说不清楚
Some Jew gets nailed to a
cross, like, uh, I don't know,

356
00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:51,111
一千多年也没人在乎 现在他将变成救命屁
a thousand who-gives-a-shit years ago, and
he's gonna be the magic pill that pulls all

357
00:19:51,113 --> 00:19:56,450
挽救我们这帮人渣 带给我们快乐和自由？
of us scumbags to happiness and freedom?

358
00:19:56,452 --> 00:19:58,585
是的 会实现的 我的兄弟
Yes, it will, my brother.

359
00:19:59,455 --> 00:20:02,856
哇哦
Wow.

360
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:04,925
哇哦
Wow!

361
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:07,027
你知道上帝给了我什么 兄弟？
You know what God gave me, brother?

362
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:10,564
你知道是什么让我解脱？
You know what sets me free?

363
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:11,965
小妞
Pussy.

364
00:20:13,602 --> 00:20:17,104
甜美 圣洁的小妞
Sweet, holy pussy.

365
00:20:17,106 --> 00:20:21,775
你们知道吗 上帝 他把人类降生在这个星球上有三个原因：
You see, God, He put man on this planet for three reasons:

366
00:20:21,777 --> 00:20:26,613
进食...挣斗....还有糟蹋小妞
eating... fighting... and tearing up tight, wet pussy!

367
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:27,981
够了 人犯
That's enough, inmate!

368
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:31,652
那..那就是我擦净黑色眼镜的方法 我的兄弟
That... that is what cleans my dark glasses, my brother.

369
00:20:31,654 --> 00:20:33,320
给我闭嘴 坐下 Morrow
Shut up and sit down, Morrow.

370
00:20:33,322 --> 00:20:34,488
我不能坐下
I can't sit!

371
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,824
我心中有上帝
I got the Lord in me!

372
00:20:36,826 --> 00:20:40,661
他要我站着 他要我讲经 他要我布道
He wants me up, He wants me
preaching, He wants me to spread

373
00:20:40,663 --> 00:20:46,500
用小妞来治病救人 用小妞来救赎 让我赞美小妞吧
pussy the healer, pussy the redeemer...
can I get a "Amen" for pussy!

374
00:20:46,502 --> 00:20:47,601
走吧
Let's go.

375
00:20:47,603 --> 00:20:49,803
你给我滚出去 混蛋
You're out of here, asshole!

376
00:20:56,946 --> 00:20:59,913
我“嗅到”了真理的味道 兄弟
I "nose" the truth now, brother!

377
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:01,849
我解脱了
I'm free.

378
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:05,419
甜美的小妞让我解脱了
Sweet pussy has set me free!

379
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:12,745
嘿
Hey.

380
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:14,747
嘿
Hey.

381
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:16,046
很高兴你回来 哥们
Glad you're back, brother.

382
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:17,308
谢谢 兄弟
Thanks, mano.

383
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,866
见到你很高兴
Good to see you.

384
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:21,168
我们知道那些都是扯淡的事
We knew it was all bullshit.

385
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:24,739
是啊 你懂的 正义终将获胜 对吧？
Yeah, you know, justice prevails, right?

386
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:29,543
Barosky来之前 我们得先聊聊
We need to catch up before Barosky comes over here, ruins our day.

387
00:21:29,545 --> 00:21:31,512
一些家事
Family thing.

388
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:33,581
好的 当然
Yeah. Sure.

389
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,927
我希望谈的是你的家事
I'm hoping it's your family you need to talk about.

390
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:50,197
Gemma现在就是我的家人 兄弟
Gemma is my family now, mano.

391
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:53,367
嗯 那好啊 我正打算和她绝交
Well, that's good, 'cause I'm about done with her.

392
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:55,636
是啊 我知道
Yeah, I'm seeing that.

393
00:21:55,638 --> 00:22:00,107
听着 我...我知道这种感觉很糟
Look, I... I know how bad this feels.

394
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:03,611
但是我觉得 你应该回头想想 用另一种眼光看看发生了什么
But I think that you should go back,
take another look at what happened.

395
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,479
从中找到事实真相 Jax
Find the truth in all of this, Jax.

396
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:07,314
我已经知道了真相 Nero
I already know the truth, Nero!

397
00:22:07,316 --> 00:22:09,316
不...不..
No... no... 


398
00:22:09,318 --> 00:22:10,885
怎么？ 你认为我老婆撒谎？
What? You think my wife is a liar?

399
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:11,886
喔
Whoa!

400
00:22:11,888 --> 00:22:14,292
我只是说事情比你想象的要复杂 兄弟
I'm just saying it's a lot more complicated, bro, than you...

401
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:15,533
好了 我知道了
Look, I get it.

402
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:19,460
你爱我老妈 你愿意站在她一边 那是你的选择
You're in love with my mom, you're staying
in her corner, that's your choice.

403
00:22:20,408 --> 00:22:22,237
但是 假如我们要继续一起做生意
But if we're going to keep doing business together,

404
00:22:22,262 --> 00:22:26,003
我和我家人的事情你不能过问
the shit that went down between me and my family is off-limits.

405
00:22:26,836 --> 00:22:28,335
明白吗？
Do you understand?

406
00:22:28,337 --> 00:22:31,005
这种内容谈话不会再有第二次了
This conversation doesn't happen again.

407
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:32,339
不管和谁
With anyone.

408
00:22:32,341 --> 00:22:37,678
Jax...
Jax... 
老大...Charlie和那位熟女来了
Boss... Charlie and the MILF madame are here.

409
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,348
好的
All right.

410
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,417
走吧 拍档
Let's go, partner.

411
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:57,832
见过我们的Boby了？
So you met Bobby?

412
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:58,666
是的
Yes.

413
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,467
很高兴你把狗头军师也带来了
Glad you brought the think tank.

414
00:23:00,469 --> 00:23:01,335
我们或许用得上
We may need them.

415
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:02,203
你交保释金出来的？
You pull bail?

416
00:23:02,205 --> 00:23:03,204
他们没什么证据
They had nothing.

417
00:23:03,206 --> 00:23:04,205
只得放我走人
Had to let me go.

418
00:23:04,207 --> 00:23:05,172
你倒是好了
Good for you.

419
00:23:05,174 --> 00:23:08,843
你得了自由 我却得关门大吉
While you were getting freed up, I was getting shut down.

420
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:13,013
违反卫生条例 来自地方检察官的“恭贺”
Health violations, compliments of our district attorney.

421
00:23:13,015 --> 00:23:16,116
我还以为 你可以利用受害人的父亲死了的事做点文章呢
I thought you were gonna use the victim's dad fubar as leverage.

422
00:23:16,118 --> 00:23:20,688
这个狡猾的婊子从另外的方向偷袭我 让我有口难言
That pitch bitch is coming at us sideways, and I
can't prove she had anything to do with that.

423
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:23,741
我们的三陪生意的申请评估也没过关...被否了
We didn't make the escort rating, either... denied.

424
00:23:23,873 --> 00:23:25,906
原因不明
Unspecified reasons.

425
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:27,801
不再会有Diosa了
No Diosa Del Sur.

426
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:29,871
该死的
Goddamn.

427
00:23:29,873 --> 00:23:32,140
她想让你为校园枪击案担罪 兄弟
She wants you for that school shooting, man.

428
00:23:32,142 --> 00:23:35,744
并且她会继续逼死每一个和你一路的人
And she's gonna continue to
strangle everybody in bed with you.

429
00:23:35,746 --> 00:23:38,313
眼下 听好了 我既不会当告密者 也不是殉道者
Now, listen, kid, I ain't no rat
but I ain't no martyr, either.

430
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,116
我来想办法
I'll figure it out.

431
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:42,217
想什么办法 Jax？
How, Jax?

432
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:44,920
瞧 这个Pattern...她手里什么证据也没有 她要孤注一掷
Look, Patterson... she's desperate; she got nothing.

433
00:23:44,922 --> 00:23:47,155
她只是狗急跳墙
She's gonna move off of all this shit.

434
00:23:47,157 --> 00:23:48,123
我们只要稍安勿躁 等着瞧
We just got to wait it out.

435
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:51,460
不 你不在Stockton 你可以等
No, you got to wait.Out of Stockton.

436
00:23:51,462 --> 00:23:53,829
不好意思 我可承担不起
I'm sorry, but I can't take the hit.

437
00:23:53,831 --> 00:23:54,997
我得撤了
I got to eject.

438
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:57,933
和帅哥Jax和摩托骑士们道别吧
Say so long to Handsome Jack and the biker brigade.

439
00:23:57,935 --> 00:23:59,468
别这样 Charlie
Come on, Charlie.

440
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,502
Nero说得对
Nero's right.

441
00:24:00,504 --> 00:24:05,240
这正中Pattern的下怀...以莫须有的罪名搞我们
This is exactly what Patterson wants...
to hurt us 'cause she's got no case.

442
00:24:05,242 --> 00:24:06,341
我知道 小伙子 我知道
I know, kid, I know.

443
00:24:06,343 --> 00:24:08,744
但是眼下 这也是我的需求
But right now, it's what I want, too.

444
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:10,779
现在 我只有抱歉了
Now, look, I'm sorry.

445
00:24:10,781 --> 00:24:13,015
事情有转机的话 通知我
Things change, you let me know.

446
00:24:13,017 --> 00:24:15,083
我们走吧
Let's go.

447
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:40,442
我没料到他会在
Didn't know he was gonna be here.

448
00:24:40,444 --> 00:24:43,045
老妈 也许我们该去里面的工作室....
Mama, maybe we should go into the studio...
别麻烦了
Don't bother.

449
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:44,312
我要走了
I'm leaving.

450
00:24:44,314 --> 00:24:46,448
别打发他帮你做那些卑鄙的勾当
Just don't send him to do your dirty work.

451
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,316
没人打发我做什么
Nobody sent me to do anything.

452
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:49,718
我只是想帮忙而已
I was just trying to help.

453
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,620
别把火撒在别人身上
Don't take it out on him.

454
00:24:51,622 --> 00:24:54,890
是啊 好吧 我想他现在知道更好
Yeah, well, I think he knows better now.

455
00:24:54,892 --> 00:24:56,825
更糟糕的事情你却不知道
Too bad you don't.

456
00:24:56,827 --> 00:24:59,961
你知道 他为了帮会做了什么吗？
You have any idea what he just did for you and the club?

457
00:24:59,963 --> 00:25:02,464
Gem Gem...别 别 别
Gem, Gem... No, no, no.

458
00:25:02,466 --> 00:25:05,200
他应该知道
He needs to know.

459
00:25:05,202 --> 00:25:07,636
什么？
What?

460
00:25:07,638 --> 00:25:10,906
地方检察官要他出卖你
D.A. wanted him to give you up.

461
00:25:10,908 --> 00:25:12,841
他不肯
He wouldn't.

462
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:17,079
但是他知道那个婊子不会善罢甘休
But he also knew that that bitch would keep coming.

463
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:20,615
于是他承认自己是枪支的来源
So he gave himself up as the gun source.

464
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,086
这是真的？
Is that true?

465
00:25:24,088 --> 00:25:25,887
嘿 你知道 这不碍事
Hey, you know, it-it didn't matter.

466
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:28,724
在我供出自己之前 我的律师发现
By the time I was gonna make
this deal, my lawyer found out

467
00:25:28,726 --> 00:25:31,426
那个警长从Toric住的旅馆里发现证据
that the sheriffs, they had
pulled evidence from Toric's

468
00:25:31,428 --> 00:25:35,530
证实了他才是杀害Erin的凶手
hotel room, proved that he was
the one that killed Erin.

469
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:38,834
于是 Patterson 他不得不放我走
So, Patterson, she had to let me go.

470
00:25:40,837 --> 00:25:44,206
我不知道她把你逼成那个样子
I didn't realize she was bending you like that.

471
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:52,214
是啊  嗯....她 呃 绝不会善罢甘休的 老弟
Yeah, well... she, uh, ain't gonna
stop until she draws blood, man.

472
00:25:52,216 --> 00:25:54,282
是啊
Yeah.

473
00:25:59,756 --> 00:26:01,823
来吧 宝贝
Come on, babe.

474
00:26:09,932 --> 00:26:12,968
你没事吧？
You all right?

475
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,170
不 不太好
No, not really.

476
00:26:21,377 --> 00:26:24,913
Nero说的对
Nero's right.

477
00:26:24,915 --> 00:26:27,015
Patterson不会善罢甘休
Patterson ain't gonna stop.

478
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:31,153
把所有弟兄都叫上
Call everyone.

479
00:26:31,155 --> 00:26:33,321
来议事堂
Chapel.

480
00:26:33,323 --> 00:26:36,057
我们得投票表决
We need to take a vote.

481
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:39,427
嘿 我们搞到了Putner家的地址 哥们
Hey. We got an address for Putner, man.

482
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:41,663
离这只隔了几条街
It's actually a few blocks from here.

483
00:26:41,665 --> 00:26:42,764
那地方叫Willow Gulch
It's Willow Gulch.

484
00:26:42,766 --> 00:26:44,966
很好 我们出发
All right, let's go.

485
00:26:44,968 --> 00:26:46,001
好的
All right.

486
00:26:46,003 --> 00:26:48,170
好的 走吧
All right, come on.

487
00:27:02,518 --> 00:27:04,319
你是Putner
You Putner?

488
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:05,620
是的
Yeah.

489

我找你们家孩子
I'm looking for your kid.

491
00:27:09,092 --> 00:27:10,659
我也在找她
Me, too.

492
00:27:10,661 --> 00:27:12,427
我听说了怎么回事
Heard about what happened.

493
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:14,095
你就是那个要找她的人？
You the one who chased her?

494
00:27:14,097 --> 00:27:15,297
是的
Yeah.

495
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,666
我没有伤害她
I didn't hurt her.

496
00:27:17,668 --> 00:27:19,701
我只是要些答案
I just want some answers.

497
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:20,936
明白了
I get that.

498
00:27:20,938 --> 00:27:23,004
进来吧
Come on in.

499
00:27:33,015 --> 00:27:35,984

00:27:35,986 --> 00:27:38,119
焦虑 易走极端
Anxiety, bipolar.

501
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:40,856
她妈妈也一样
Her mom had it, too.

502
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:45,026
你知道我是谁吗？
Do you know who I am?

503
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:47,829
知道
Yeah.

504
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:51,299
那就是她袭击我们的原因 你是这么认为的吗？
Is that why she attacked us, do you think?

505
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:53,435
就因为我老爸的原因？
Because of my dad?

506
00:27:56,472 --> 00:27:59,541
这周我们过得很艰难
Been a rough week.

507
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:02,344
我失去房子
I lost the house.

508
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:05,313
我们得卷铺盖走人
We've been packing shit up.

509
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:08,383
刚好发现很多她老妈的相片
Came across a lot of photos of her mom.

510
00:28:08,385 --> 00:28:13,154
还发现当时 关于她老妈的报纸新闻
Found the newspaper article about her death.

511
00:28:13,156 --> 00:28:19,227
她马上认为是你老爸引起的连环撞车 导致她老妈的死亡
First time she realized your dad
caused the pileup that killed her mom.

512
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:23,531
我估计 以她胡思乱想的小脑瓜 她把仇算在你们头上了
I guess, in her messy little brain, she blames you guys.

513
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:25,200
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

514
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:27,269

怎么了？
Why?


519
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:40,548
她看上去很眼熟
She looks familiar.

520
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,950
我知道
I know.

521
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:44,185
我也会这样
Happens to me, too.

522
00:28:44,187 --> 00:28:48,423
看别人的时候...好像也看到她
I see her a lot...in other people.

523
00:28:52,895 --> 00:28:56,898
那么你知道孩子大概会在哪？
So you got any idea where your kid might be?

524
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,966
我不知道
I don't know.

525
00:28:57,968 --> 00:28:59,301
但是她总要回来
She always comes home, though.

526
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:02,704
我会和她谈谈 把事情说清楚
I'll talk to her and straighten this out.

527
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:04,806
嗯 好吧
Yeah, okay.

528
00:29:04,808 --> 00:29:06,708
我会赔偿你的损失
We'll pay for the damage.

529
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,711
不 不用担心这个
No, don't worry about that.

530
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:11,780
多谢
Thank you.

531
00:29:13,783 --> 00:29:15,884

谢谢
Thank you.

537

00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:52,687

You looking for Jax?

539
00:29:52,689 --> 00:29:56,591
不 我是 呃 希望能和你谈谈
No. I was, uh, hoping I could talk to you.

540
00:29:56,593 --> 00:29:58,693
没问题
Sure.

541
00:30:00,663 --> 00:30:03,331
给他吃的药 呃 是治他的先天缺陷？
Is that for his,uh, birth defect?

542
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,834
是的 心率失常
Yeah. Heart arrhythmia.

543
00:30:05,836 --> 00:30:08,103
这病似乎不能阻止他活泼好动
Doesn't seem to slow him down.

544
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:11,539
嗯 是的
No, it doesn't.

545
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:13,875
你感觉怎样？
How are you feeling?

546
00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:16,011
还行
Fine.

547
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:22,851
我估计你来这 不是只为了解我家人的健康状况吧
I'm assuming you're not just here to
check on the health of my family.

548
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:24,452
实际上是的
Actually, I am.

549
00:30:24,454 --> 00:30:27,389
情绪健康方面
Emotional health.

550
00:30:27,391 --> 00:30:30,191
我们正设法对付
Well, we're all getting through it.

551
00:30:30,193 --> 00:30:32,293
不是每个人都如此
Not everyone.

552
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:40,502
医生 你知道 我感觉你不是一个有恶意的人
Doc, you know, you don't strike me
as being a malicious kind of person.

553
00:30:40,504 --> 00:30:43,443
我敢肯定 不管你和Gemma之间发生什么事情
I'm sure whatever it was that happened
between you and Gemma,

554
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:45,684
一定有你认为正当的理由
you did what you thought was right.

555
00:30:45,742 --> 00:30:47,375
是Gemma袭击了我
Gemma attacked me.

556
00:30:47,377 --> 00:30:49,044
导致了流产
Caused a miscarriage.

557
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:55,016
是啊 我请求你换个角度看待问题
Right. I guess I'm asking if you could
take another look at what's been done.

558
00:30:55,018 --> 00:30:57,352
你们的家庭已经产生了裂痕
The rip it's causing in your family.

559
00:30:57,354 --> 00:30:59,888
你不用理会我们的家事
You don't get to weigh in on my family.

560
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,056
你不了解我
You don't know me.

561
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:04,759
是 我不了解 但是你我都了解Gemma
No, I don't, but I do know Gemma and so do you.

562
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:09,397
她不会服软的
She's not gonna lay down for this.

563
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:13,034
也许我们都应该想个折中的办法
Maybe we could find some kind of middle ground here.

564
00:31:13,036 --> 00:31:17,939
如果不能的话...对每个人来说都不得安宁
'Cause if not... this is not gonna end up well for anyone.

565
00:31:17,941 --> 00:31:19,040
也包括你
Including you.

566
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:21,443
你知道和她在一起的男人的下场
You see what happens to the men she's with.

567
00:31:21,445 --> 00:31:23,211
一个死了 另一个进了监狱
One husband dead, another in jail.

568
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:25,246
是啊 哎 你知道 这就是生活
Yeah, well, you know,that's the life.

569
00:31:25,248 --> 00:31:26,347
不 是毒妇
No, it's the wife!

570
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:29,551
是她杀了John Teller 
She killed John Teller!

571
00:31:29,553 --> 00:31:32,087
也许不会用同样的方式对付Clay
Probably would've done the same to Clay.

572
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:33,621
你想善终吗？
You want it to end well?

573
00:31:33,623 --> 00:31:37,692
我建议你退出来 免得到时你也死得难看
I suggest you get out now before you end up dead, too.

574
00:31:52,446 --> 00:31:54,781
他就是那个在小教堂里发狂的那位？
Is he the one who flipped out in the chapel?

575
00:31:54,783 --> 00:31:55,782
是的 医生
Yeah, Doc.

576
00:31:55,784 --> 00:31:57,083
他现在平静下来了
He's calm now.

577
00:31:57,085 --> 00:31:58,084
没有威胁了
He's secure.

578
00:31:58,086 --> 00:32:00,119
好的 我知道了
Okay. I got it.

579
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:01,821
去六号房帮帮Nance
Go help Nance in six.

580
00:32:01,823 --> 00:32:04,057
Tanner又在搞事了
Tanner had another episode.

581
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:06,125
糟糕 好的
Shit. Yeah, okay.

582
00:32:13,935 --> 00:32:15,068
你是Morrow？
You Morrow?

583
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,403
是的
Yeah.

584
00:32:21,842 --> 00:32:25,345
下一次换班之前 你有40分钟的时间
You got 40 minutes till the next rotation.

585
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:31,345
你要是被抓了 就算是出卖了我
You get caught, you give me up.

586
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:36,164
我会把你拖到这里绑上 注射3倍的镇静剂
I'll pull you in here, strap you down,
fry your brain with a

587
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:38,958
把你的脑子好好烤烤
triple dose of Thorazine.

588
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,295
这就是你当医生立下的誓言吗？
What part of the Hippocratic oath is that?

589
00:32:42,297 --> 00:32:47,667
你的爱尔兰朋友付的钱 还不足够让我栽跟头
Same part that says your mick friends
don't pay enough for me to take a fall.

590
00:33:14,028 --> 00:33:17,997
Murphy 夫人 Knowles医生给你的 十分钟前
Ms. Murphy, from Dr. Knowles,ten minutes ago.

591
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:20,066
谢谢
Thank you.

592
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:32,578
Tara?

593
00:33:33,915 --> 00:33:35,548
她回家了
She went home.

594
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,418
我可以马上把保安叫来
I can have security here in an instant.

595
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,153
没必要
No need.

596
00:33:40,155 --> 00:33:43,923
我在想你们怎么做到的
I debated how to do this.

597
00:33:43,925 --> 00:33:48,342
我的行事方式.....你们这样对付我...
The way I feel... what you did to me...

598
00:33:49,768 --> 00:33:53,643
我本来可以把你的细脖子扭断
I could squeeze the swallow out of that pale white throat.

599
00:33:56,737 --> 00:34:01,407
但这只会让你觉得更有正义感
But that would just give you a greater sense of righteousness.

600
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:04,744
现在我来告诉你我会怎么做
So let me tell you what's gonna happen now.

601
00:34:04,746 --> 00:34:09,215
我会把这些伪造Tara怀孕和流产的病历
I'm gonna take those medical records documenting Tara's

602
00:34:09,217 --> 00:34:15,188
递交给医院的董事会
pregnancy and her miscarriage, and I'll
present them to the hospital board.

603
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:20,026
让他们知道 他们的新院长是个骗子
Let them know that their Neonatal
administrator is a bit of a grifter.

604
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:23,763
你和我的话 他们更愿意相信谁
It would be my word against yours.

605
00:34:23,765 --> 00:34:26,232
这我倒想知道
That's all I needed to know.

606
00:34:26,234 --> 00:34:28,034
多谢了 红鼻头
Thanks, Red.

607
00:34:28,036 --> 00:34:30,870
你什么意思？
What does that mean?

608
00:34:30,872 --> 00:34:33,485
意思是 如果怀孕这件事情确有其事
It means if the pregnancy was legit,

609
00:34:33,762 --> 00:34:37,216
你不会告诉我 说这些病历是真的 还说我疯了
you would've told me that those
documents were real and called me crazy.

610
00:34:39,947 --> 00:34:41,747
你没法证明
You can't prove anything.

611
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:44,050
哦 我不需要证明什么
Oh, I don't need to prove it.

612
00:34:44,052 --> 00:34:48,721
我只需要比那个瘾君子更可靠的消息来源 去告诉我的儿子
I just needed a more reliable source
than a junkie to share with my son.

613
00:34:48,723 --> 00:34:51,824
他将会去证实
He's gonna be the one to prove it.

614
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:56,101
当他这样做时 我现在告诉你 红鼻头...
And when he does, I'll tell you right now, Red...

615
00:34:57,691 --> 00:35:02,520
这个州可没有足够的保安来保障你的安全
there won't be enough security in this state to keep you safe.

616
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:14,413
同意
Yea.

617
00:35:14,415 --> 00:35:18,084
我代表West 和 Montez投票 他们也同意
Proxied West and Montez, they're a yea.

618
00:35:18,086 --> 00:35:20,820
同意
Yea.

619
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:23,156
同意
Yea.

620
00:35:23,158 --> 00:35:25,992
同意
Yea.

621
00:35:25,994 --> 00:35:27,593
同意
Yea.

622
00:35:27,595 --> 00:35:30,496
很好
All right.

623
00:35:30,498 --> 00:35:32,598
我去出个价码
I'll go make the offer.

624
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:43,676
把他带进来
Send him in.

625
00:35:55,522 --> 00:35:57,123
请坐
Have a seat.

626
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:13,673
我不得不说 我很惊讶 你和我面对面坐着
I must say, I'm rather surprised
to see you sitting across from me.

627
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:16,809
没人比我更惊讶
No more surprised than I am.

628
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:19,845
说说你来这贵干？
So why are you here?

629
00:36:21,316 --> 00:36:27,086
混乱之子是由我父亲 John Teller一手创建
Sons of Anarchy was started by my father, John Teller.

630
00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:30,690
他一直希望俱乐部合法化
He always wanted a legitimate club.

631
00:36:30,692 --> 00:36:32,491
就为这个目标 他死了
Died pursuing that.

632
00:36:32,493 --> 00:36:34,660
我没兴趣听你讲历史
I'm not in a mood for a history lesson.

633
00:36:34,662 --> 00:36:36,351
为何你不开门见山 Teller先生
Why don't you get to it, Mr. Teller.

634
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:41,434
我来这就是和你谈价码
I'm here to make you an offer.

635
00:36:41,436 --> 00:36:42,501
和我谈价...
To make me...

636
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,339
哇哦
Wow.

637
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:52,511
你可真有胆量 小伙子
You really have some balls, kid.

638
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:56,515
我还知道卖KG-9的爱尔兰人的情况
I also have an Irishman who sells KG-9s.

639
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,720
爱尔兰共和军？
IRA?

640
00:37:00,722 --> 00:37:02,922
如假包换的爱尔兰共和军
Real IRA.

641
00:37:02,924 --> 00:37:06,826
就是现在爱尔兰天主教革命之王
Current kings of the Irish Catholic revolution.

642
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:13,366
那么你的价码是什么？
So what are you offering?

643
00:37:13,368 --> 00:37:15,768
Gaalan O'Shay
Gaalan O'Shay.

644
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,770
你可以去联邦调查局查查
You can check with the feds.

645
00:37:17,772 --> 00:37:19,939
他可是条大鱼
He's a big win.

646
00:37:19,941 --> 00:37:23,209
我可以把他交出来 附赠一船的枪支
I will deliver him with a shipment of guns.

647
00:37:23,211 --> 00:37:26,312
干脆利落
Open and shut.

648
00:37:26,314 --> 00:37:33,219
什么时候 什么方式 把这条“大鱼”交出来？
And when and how would you deliver this "big win"?

649
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:36,656
十天以后
It'll happen in the next ten days.

650
00:37:36,658 --> 00:37:38,791
怎样做到 那是我的事情
The "how" is my job.

651
00:37:41,828 --> 00:37:45,498
这是一个很大胆的提议啊
It's a very bold proposition.

652
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,801
何不告诉我 你想得到什么好处？
So why don't you tell me what's in it for you.

653
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:53,806
豁免混乱之子 一切关于贩卖枪支的指控
Immunity for the MC for all gun charges.

654
00:37:53,808 --> 00:37:56,008
包括过去以及现在的
Past and present.

655
00:37:58,345 --> 00:38:01,080
我希望有一个合法的俱乐部
I want a legitimate club.

656
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:04,641
但是如果大家都对我们恨之入骨 那可就成不了
That can't happen while people try to crush us,

657
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:07,603
那会毁了我们的生意
ruining all of our business relationships.

658
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:12,758
先在Stockton放我们一马
Let us breathe in Stockton.

659
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,863
我们不会干犯法的勾当 暴力活动也会停止
We won't break the law and the violence stops.

660
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:25,338
就这些？
That's it?

661
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:30,443
如果你真的认为你能交出爱尔兰共和军 那么我想
If you thought you could deliver
the IRA, then I figure you would

662
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:35,214
至少你会提出个人要求
at least also have a personal request.

663
00:38:35,216 --> 00:38:37,516
确实
I do.

664
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:42,555
你必须重新审审Tara的案子
You need to look at Tara's case again.

665
00:38:42,557 --> 00:38:47,526
Toric才是案子的关键所在
Toric was the one connecting the dots that didn't exist.

666
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:55,634
Tara确实不知道Otto会对付那个护士
Tara had no idea what Otto was gonna do to that nurse.

667
00:38:55,636 --> 00:38:57,470
这点我们都清楚
We both know that.

668
00:38:57,472 --> 00:39:02,174
据我所知 这样的巧合太难发生了
What I know and what I can prove rarely come together.

669
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:10,416
那么....对这些事情 我都应该善意的推测？
So... I'm supposed to expedite all of these things on good faith?

670
00:39:10,418 --> 00:39:12,551
都把它们当成真的？
Just assume it's all real?

671
00:39:12,553 --> 00:39:14,253
不需要什么善意
You don't need faith.

672
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:19,592
你只要睁一只眼闭一只眼放过去 给我们一些空间让我们动起来
Just have everything ready to go, and
give us the space to put it in motion.

673
00:39:19,594 --> 00:39:25,831
假如爱尔兰人发现我们被跟踪 整件事情就吹了
If the Irish think we're being
tailed, this whole thing implodes.

674
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:29,702
到时我会告诉你到哪找到Gaalan和那些枪支
I'll tell you where to find Gaalan and the guns.

675
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:35,674
那么你和你们那帮人 就这样轻易逃脱 连毛皮都不用掉一根？
And you and your crew, you just skate away
without so much as a slap on the wrist?

676
00:39:35,676 --> 00:39:37,943
他们会血腥反抗 你才能抓到我 女士
You can slap my wrists until they're bloody, lady.

677
00:39:37,945 --> 00:39:40,045
我可不在乎
I don't give a shit.

678
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:44,683
我在给你大大的好处
I'm giving you a win well above your pay grade.

679
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:49,088
让你立下大功 还能全身而退
You get your devil and you punch
your ticket out of this cesspool.

680
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:52,525
那么就让我们别再纠结什么正义了
So let's not get too lost in righteousness.

681
00:39:55,095 --> 00:40:01,567
我是个无法无天的混蛋 而你是正义的卫道士
I'm the scumbag outlaw, and
you're the pillar of justice.

682
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:05,838
都不喜欢看着镜子里的自己
And neither one of us likes looking
at ourselves in the mirror.

683
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:13,946
我们成交吗？
Do we have a deal?

684
00:40:17,784 --> 00:40:22,788
10天之内 要是我听不到你的消息
If I don't hear from you within ten days...

685
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:26,001
我会花上 我还在位的七个月时间
I will spend the last seven months in this office

686
00:40:26,002 --> 00:40:29,522
我会在法律的允许范围内 让你生不如死
making your life as miserable as the law allows.

687
00:40:29,764 --> 00:40:36,202
还要算上你老婆...等到你儿子中学毕业 她才能从监狱出来
And your wife... she will be in jail until
your boys graduate from high school.

688
00:40:39,043 --> 00:40:41,110
好吧
Okay.

689
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:18,773
我会查短信
We'll check messages.

690
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:19,899
好的
Fine.

691
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:22,554
大叔 你有钥匙吗？
Uncle T, you got the key?

692
00:41:23,304 --> 00:41:24,303
嘿 好的
Hey. All right.

693
00:41:24,305 --> 00:41:26,239
谢谢
Thanks.

694
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:27,911
有啊 在这
You got it. Right here.

695

你想买下来？
Want to buy it?

696
00:41:29,683 --> 00:41:31,215
我们减价大拍卖
We're having a fire sale.

697
00:41:31,217 --> 00:41:32,717

Shit.

701
00:41:37,724 --> 00:41:40,925
等着保险公司计算损失
Waiting for the insurance to come up with a number.

702

很明显 我们可没有“炸损险”
Apparently we didn't have C-4 coverage.

703
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:48,566

704

我们退出了贩枪生意
Moving out of guns.

706
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:59,210
亡羊补牢 为时不晚 我是这么认为的
Better late than never, I guess.

707
00:41:59,212 --> 00:42:00,778
就这些

708
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,614

717
00:42:17,897 --> 00:42:21,332
我只是他的雇主 不是他的神仙姐姐
I'm his employer, not his fairy godmother.

718
00:42:21,334 --> 00:42:25,570
别这样 Oswald 你有贷款机构又有高利贷公司
Come on, Oswald, you got a
credit union and a loan company.

719

别让他失去房子

I'd help him, but we're tapped.

721

这对你很重要吗？
Why's this so important to you?

722
00:42:36,683 --> 00:42:38,850
我也说不好
I don't know.

723
00:42:40,753 --> 00:42:44,489
嘿 算我欠你的

724

我正在准备竞选市长

我告诉过你 我的家事你不能管

这就是为什么你称她是骗子？

747
00:44:24,624 --> 00:44:25,523
什么？
What?

748

你说她是爱耍手腕的婊子

你告诉他

他必须知道...他必须明白你为他做了什么
Now he needs to know... he needs

那次和Clay发生什么事？
So what happened with Clay?

774
00:45:52,144 --> 00:45:55,146
那几个监狱的看守

强迫你老妈和Clay发生关系

他们还把裤子脱了
While they got off.

778

I just talked to Margaret... who
confirmed what you refuse to believe.

782

亲爱的 这一切都是谎言

812
00:49:14,539 --> 00:49:16,807
为什么？
Why?

813
00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:18,141
为了监护权
Custody waiver.

814
00:49:18,143 --> 00:49:21,178
这样Gemma就不能带走孩子们了
So Gemma couldn't take the boys.

815

Tara只是想...
Tara was just trying...
滚出去

818
00:50:15,466 --> 00:50:18,702
你得到你所需要的？

为什么你要去找Tara？

827

我可不喜欢那样
It's not what I wanted.

828

我也不知道
I don't know.

829
00:51:07,258 --> 00:51:12,066
原以为 要是她知道了造成了这么严重的后果...
I thought maybe if she knew
all the damage that was being done...

830
00:51:13,513 --> 00:51:15,428
我估计事与愿违吧
I guess that backfired.

831
00:51:16,428 --> 00:51:18,562
是啊
Yeah.

832
00:51:24,869 --> 00:51:28,071
她还说了你的事

是关于John的
About John.

00:51:47,593 --> 00:51:49,793
说是你杀了他
That you killed him.

837
00:51:52,396 --> 00:51:54,631
真相时什么？
Any truth to that?

838
00:52:18,122 --> 00:52:21,658
John当时希望帮会退出枪支生意
John was trying to get the club out of guns.

839
00:52:23,494 --> 00:52:26,663
那时候局势和现在一样紧张

840
00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:30,727
他来来回回去贝尔法斯特好几次
He was making trips back and forth to Belfast,

841
00:52:30,728 --> 00:52:32,784
试图和爱尔兰人把这事情谈妥

842
00:52:36,674 --> 00:52:39,142
那时他爱上另一个人

843
00:52:41,479 --> 00:52:44,181
就是Maureen Ashby
Maureen Ashby.

844
00:52:44,183 --> 00:52:47,323
他哥哥是一位牧师 John的老朋友
Brother was a priest,friend of John's,

845
00:52:49,042 --> 00:52:52,660
帮忙做中间人 使得能与爱尔兰共和军和平过渡
helping broker a peaceful transition with the IRA.

846
00:52:57,428 --> 00:52:59,663
我新发现后
I found out.

847
00:53:01,632 --> 00:53:04,067
开始和Clay混在了一起
Started spending time with Clay.

848
00:53:07,772 --> 00:53:13,543
我的小儿子Thomas就是John不在家时死了
My Thomas died when John was away on one of those trips.

849
00:53:13,545 --> 00:53:19,049
他回来以后 我也不再温柔娴淑
And I wasn't kind when he got home.

850
00:53:19,051 --> 00:53:25,689
失去孩子的愤怒和痛苦 我要他也尝尝
The pain and anger of losing my
baby, I made sure it landed on him.

851
00:53:25,691 --> 00:53:29,459
从那时起 他就能人事了
He came undone after that.

852
00:53:31,362 --> 00:53:33,897
与IRA的谈判也谈崩了
Talks with the IRA fell apart.

853
00:53:33,899 --> 00:53:36,867
Clay 和 McGee勾搭在一起 又开始做枪支生意
Clay and McGee put them back together again.

854
00:53:36,869 --> 00:53:38,735
从另一个方面
In the other direction.

855
00:53:38,737 --> 00:53:41,371
使得帮会更加深的陷入枪支生意
Solidified the gun trade for the club.

856
00:53:41,373 --> 00:53:44,808
他们开始掌权

857
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:54,751
然而JT....他开始把这一切写进他的日记里 一部手稿
But JT... he started writing in this...
this journal, a manuscript.

858
00:53:54,753 --> 00:53:58,822
那是赤裸裸的忏悔 怀疑他所有的选择
It was a bleeding confession,questioning all his choices,

859
00:53:58,824 --> 00:54:02,592
对所有他为帮会做过的一切都感到懊悔
regretting everything he'd ever done in SAMCRO.

860
00:54:04,528 --> 00:54:07,697
他不再关心帮会
He stopped caring about the club.

861
00:54:07,699 --> 00:54:10,066
不关心家人
About his family.

862
00:54:12,403 --> 00:54:15,605
那时候正是危机四伏的时刻
And it was a dangerous time here.

863
00:54:15,607 --> 00:54:17,707
和玛雅帮的争斗

864
00:54:17,709 --> 00:54:20,844
联邦调查局的渗透
Feds infiltrating MCs.

865
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,482
人人自危
Everyone was scared.

866
00:54:29,553 --> 00:54:32,522
JT是最薄弱的一环
JT was a weak link.

867
00:54:47,071 --> 00:54:50,440
你没有回答我的问题
You didn't answer my question.

868
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:56,313
我没有杀他
I didn't kill him.

869
00:54:56,315 --> 00:54:59,582
但是我知道 他肯定会被干掉
But I knew it had to be done.

870
00:54:59,584 --> 00:55:05,889
就如同不得不处理Arcadio一样
The same way you knew it had to be done with Arcadio.

871
00:55:05,891 --> 00:55:09,426
我们死也好活也好 都是这规矩
We live and die by that code.

872
00:55:09,428 --> 00:55:12,762
现在我知道 那时候我也知道
I know it now, and I knew it then.

873
00:55:12,764 --> 00:55:18,802
我不会对我深爱的男人有任何的隐瞒
And I did not hide my opinion from
the man I'd fallen in love with.

874
00:55:22,173 --> 00:55:26,810
Clay 要杀 John Teller 我给了我的祝福
I gave my blessing for Clay to kill John Teller.

875
00:55:35,953 --> 00:55:38,655
这事我没有告诉过任何人

876
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:43,093
包括我的儿子

877
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,982
老天 Jackie
Jesus Christ, Jackie.

878
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:18,968
你没事吧？
You okay?

879
00:56:18,977 --> 00:56:20,082
我很好
I'm all right.

880
00:56:22,094 --> 00:56:23,401

那个扳手女孩？

883
00:56:27,225 --> 00:56:28,190
是的
Yeah.

884
00:56:28,192 --> 00:56:30,126
她不肯说什么
She hasn't said much.

885
00:56:30,128 --> 00:56:32,128
除非要见到你
Except that she needs to see you.

886
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:35,364
让我和她单独聊聊
Let me talk to her alone.

887
00:56:35,366 --> 00:56:37,466
她又没被人包裹起来

888

走了
Go.

889
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:44,073

还有你 笛子先生

那个吹笛子的人很有趣

893
00:57:03,428 --> 00:57:07,129
我们是在家门口的一个篮子里发现他的

894
00:57:09,266 --> 00:57:12,068

被水管扳手给打了
