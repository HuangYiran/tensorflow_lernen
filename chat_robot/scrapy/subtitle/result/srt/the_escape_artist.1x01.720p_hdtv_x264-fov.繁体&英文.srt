Can you take me here, please?

3

Right, Charles, sorry about that.

00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,790
我給你講講我們的進展
OK, let me fill you in on where we are.

5
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,380
我們在行李箱里裝了可卡因
We had the cocaine in a holdall.

6
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,960
然后到了停車場
We moved into the car park

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,970
看見斯科特先生拿著桿雙管獵槍
where we saw our friend Mr Scott walking out

8
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,200
從他的車后面走出來
from behind his van holding a double-barrelled shotgun.

9
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,180
好  聽著  大概一個小時以后見
OK, listen, see you in about an hour.

好好  再見
OK. OK, bye.

11
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,430
不好意思  我是律師
Sorry about that. I'm a lawyer.

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,400
真的
Honestly.

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,540
這是杰米的爸爸伯頓先生
Jamie's dad, Mr Burton,

14
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,700
他今天來給大家講講他的工作
has come in today to talk about what he does at work.

15
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,550
-嗨  -你們知道律師干什么嗎  杰米
- Hi. - Do any of you know what a barrister does? Yes, Jamie?

16
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,800
-他讓人不用坐牢  -怎么做到的呢
- He stops people from going to prison. - And how does he do that?

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,410
他告訴法庭這個人沒罪
He tells a court that someone didn't do a crime.

18
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,080
有時候證據不足
And sometimes the evidence doesn't cut it.

19
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,650
然后他說好了放假回來卻不能回來
And sometimes that means he can't come on holiday like he promised.

20
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,450
其實我大部分時間都在庭上對法官講話
Actually, my job is mostly standing up and talking to a judge in court.

21
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,350
你都說些什么
What do you talk about?

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,350
如果有人說看見你偷了同學的筆
If someone said they saw you take your classmate's pen,

23
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,860
而你說你沒偷
and you said you didn't take it,

24
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,730
我的職責就是證明目擊者看錯了
my job would be to show that whoever saw you was mistaken.

25
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,160
要是我真的偷了筆呢
What happens if I did take the pen anyway?

26
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,540
那你就有罪
Well, then you'd be guilty.

27
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,700
對  但如果我說我沒偷
Yeah, but what if I said I didn't take it,

28
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,130
而看見我偷的人眼神又不好呢
and the person who saw me has bad eyesight,

29
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,950
而你嘴皮子很厲害
and you're so good at arguing

30
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,070
他們也不能確定是我偷了呢
they can't be sure it was me who took it?

31
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,160
這樣啊  那就叫合理懷疑
Ah! Well, then, that's what you call a reasonable doubt.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,810
那我能把筆留著了
So I get to keep the pen?

33
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,000
對  那是你僥幸脫罪
Yes, but then you'd be getting away with it.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,330
如果你爸爸站我這邊的話
Only if your dad was on my side.

It was the only object Mr Kumarin had to hand.

你就光吃奶酪
I don't think you're eating anything that isn't made entirely from cheese.

134
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,190
你得先按下按鈕吧
I think you'll find you have to press the button first.

135
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,500
我按了  就是按下去這個動作
I did press it. I used a pressing motion.

136
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,190
現在好了
There now.

137
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,060
-我剛剛就是這么做的  -行吧
- I just did that. - OK.

138
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,190
謝謝你的支持  太感謝了
Thanks for your support. Really appreciate it.

139
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,060
好了  出發啦
Come on, we're going.

140
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,540
等等
Hang on.

141
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,320
把你的包從后座拿下來  好嗎
Get your bags off the back seat. OK?

142
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,320
-本  -你們好啊
- Hey, Ben. - All right.

143
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,880
你是洗泡泡浴的花衣魔笛手
You're the Pied Piper of bubble baths.

144
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,880
{\an8}花衣魔笛手  德國童話中的人物

145
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,330
這里也許還能擠進來一個高大的蘇格蘭人
You know, there might be room in here for a large Scotsman.

146
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,090
-我還有點事  -隨便你吧
- I've got to catch up on something. - Oh, well, suit yourself.

147
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,680
可惜了這兒朦朧的燭光
It's all candles and twilight in here though.

148
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,430
是你的損失哦
Your loss.

149
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,380
別打呼了
Stop snoring.

150
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,130
抱歉  害你睡不著嗎
Sorry, am I keeping you up?

151
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,830
真幽默
Funny guy.

152
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,280
杰米說你昨天在學校帥呆了
You were quite the hit at school yesterday. So Jamie said.

153
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,000
他們貌似挺喜歡
They seemed to enjoy it.

154
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,650
他的小伙伴們都想讓你做他們的律師了
All his wee pals want you to be their lawyer now.

155
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,970
知道有你撐腰  他們都要有恃無恐
They're all going to go out and commit GBH safe

156
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,900
去犯重罪了
in the knowledge you'll get them off.

157
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,630
還真讓人寬心啊
Well, that's very reassuring.

158
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,810
可他們不知道你的大腦里滿是洞洞
Little do they know that that large brain of yours is full of holes.

159
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,450
你的硬盤滿了
Your hard drive's full.

160
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,940
-這就是你的問題  -我明白了
- That's your problem. - I see.

161
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,750
你需要時不時做個備份
You just need to back it up now and again.

162
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,390
要怎么做呢
How do I do that?

163
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,760
你身上又暖又舒服
You're so nice and warm.

164
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,890
希姆金斯先生  為什么選我去打官司
Mr Simkins, why did you choose me to lead this?

165
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,440
而不選皇家律師呢
I mean, why me, over a silk?

166
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,430
因為我見過太多皇家律師瀟灑地接手
Because I've seen too many silks who try and waltz in

167
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,440
草率地應對一樁案子
and blunderbuss their way through a case

168
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,050
他們只在出庭的路上瞥一眼而已
they've only glanced at on the way to the court.

169
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,240
因為像這樣的案子  我想要
Because in a case like this I want someone

170
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,950
一個整天埋頭研究證據的人
who spends days elbows deep in the evidence.

171
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,380
因為我的委托人如今正站在一塊石頭
Because my client stands between a rock

172
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,450
和一大坨屎中間
and a bucket of shit

173
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,530
他需要盡可能多的幫助
and he needs all the help he can get.

174
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,700
還有呢
And?

175
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,080
-說實話  -是的
- Honestly? - Yeah.

176
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,740
因為你總能贏
Because you win.

177
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,240
你現在睡這里了嗎  伯頓先生
Are you sleeping here now, Mr Burton?

178
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,450
-現在什么時候了  -周二
- What time is it? - Tuesday.

179
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,430
我愛上卡洛斯·特維斯了[阿根廷球員]
I think I fancy Carlos Tevez.

180
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,970
他是隊長
For captain.

181
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,110
你看過這些照片嗎
Did you look at these pictures?

182
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,760
以前見過這樣的情況嗎
You ever seen anything like it? Before?

183
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,890
我從沒見過
I've never.

184
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,990
大多時候她都沒斷氣
She was alive for most of it, you know?

185
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,330
活著呢
She was alive.

186
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,340
我們步行穿過公園
"We were walking through the park,

187
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,730
聽著iPod里面的音樂
and listening to music on our iPod.

188
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,320
回家以后才發現鞋底有血跡
We did not notice the blood on our shoes until we got home."

189
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,500
我們沒注意走過了哪些地方
Because we'd not been paying much attention to where we'd been walking,

190
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,300
我們走到了
and because our walk had taken us through

191
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,660
灌木深處  以及很深的草叢中
areas of deeper undergrowth and high grasses.

192
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,150
第一眼看到這血  我們以為
When we first saw the blood we presumed

193
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,930
誤踩了動物尸體
we had stepped in the remains of an animal."

194
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,990
-比方說  一只松鼠  -沒錯
- A squirrel, for example? - Yes.

195
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,230
知道嗎  灰松鼠正在殺紅松鼠
Did you know the grey squirrels are killing all the red squirrels?

196
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,030
-有耳聞  -可他們最近又發現一種黑松鼠
- I did, yes. - But now they've discovered a black squirrel.

197
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,480
-福伊爾先生  -它們又在殺灰松鼠
- Mr Foyle. - And that's killing all the greys.

198
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,210
早晚會知道  小心沒大錯
Goes to show, you can't be too careful.

199
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,980
福伊爾先生  可以開始了嗎
Mr Foyle. Can we please get on?

200
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,190
福伊爾先生  你通常哪天去洗衣房洗衣
What day do you take your laundry to be service washed, Mr Foyle?

201
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,800
-周二是洗衣日  -能不能解釋
- Tuesday's wash day. - Can you explain why,

202
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,990
數月來一直周二洗衣的你
after months of Tuesdays,

203
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,080
為何突然周一去洗衣
you took your washing in on a Monday?

204
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,270
褲子不夠穿了  不是嗎
We'd run out of pants, hadn't we?

205
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,710
因為沒有干凈衣服可穿
We took our laundry to be washed a day early

206
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,450
所以提前一天去洗
because we'd run out of clothing.

207
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,010
-是的  -鞋子上的血跡讓你更加迫切地
- Correct. - The fact we found blood on our shoes after our walk

208
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,490
-想要提前去洗衣  -事實如此
- increased our desire to do our washing early. - That's the truth.

209
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,550
你的鞋子一般都用洗衣機洗嗎
Do you normally wash your shoes in the washing machine?

210
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,260
沾了血的話就用
I do if they have blood on them.

211
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,880
好
Right.

212
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,710
我們必須要談一下網站的事情
We're going to have to talk about the websites.

213
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,180
對方會試圖指控
The other side are going to try to claim

214
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,920
你習慣性地瀏覽通常被稱為
you habitually view images and video

215
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,670
"極端色情"的圖片和視頻
that are commonly referred to as "extreme pornography",

216
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,980
"極端色情"包含
an umbrellaterm for filmed acts

217
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,000
危及或狀似危及人身生命
which threaten, or appear to threaten, a person's life,

218
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,500
造成參與者嚴重傷害
result in serious injury to participants

219
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,400
或者有毆打  啃噬
or appear to involve torture, biting,

220
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,980
針對人類尸體的性行為等內容
sexual interference with a human corpse.

221
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,180
這與被害者遭受的傷害
And that this has a link to the nature of the injuries

222
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,700
構成一定的聯系
sustained by the victim.

223
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,900
我不做那種事情
I don't do that kind of thing.

224
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,880
很遺憾  你的信用卡記錄顯示的恰恰相反
Unfortunately, your credit card statements tell a different story.

225
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,220
你在數家網站都有消費記錄
They show payments to a number of websites,

226
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,360
這些網站被曝光含有
which have been revealed to distribute this...

227
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,960
這種類型的內容
this kind of material.

228
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,590
信用卡撒謊
The credit cards are lying.

229
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,400
好吧
Right.

230
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,580
我必須告訴你  福伊爾先生  形勢很嚴峻
I have to tell you, Mr Foyle, already this is a huge challenge.

231
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,520
你陳述的方式需要仔細琢磨
We're going to have to work on your presentation style.

232
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,960
你所見都是事實
What you see is what you get.

233
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,070
沒錯  現在這正是問題所在  不是嗎
Yes, well, that's part of the problem, isn't it?

234
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,100
-他一定要在這里嗎  -是的  必須
- Does he have to be here? - Yes, he does. Yeah.

235
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,690
是這樣的  伯頓先生
Here's the thing, Mr Burton,

236
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,030
不知道你有沒有注意到
and I don't know whether you've picked it up

237
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:06,660
或者你的第六感有沒有發覺
or perhaps your sixth sense might have spotted it.

238
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,560
我不是特別喜歡人
I don't like people very much.

239
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,900
我就不是那么和善的一個
I'm just not a very nice person.

240
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,120
-我不是來評判你的  -對  歸紅衣服做
- I'm not here to judge you. - No, the man in red does that.

241
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,110
我來是為你辯護  盡我所能陳述你的案件
I'm here to defend you and present your case as best as I can.

242
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,960
-為此...  -你認為是我做的  對吧
- In order to do that... - You think I did it, don't you?

243
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,160
這就是問題所在
That's the problem here.

244
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,320
我沒這么說
It's not what I was saying.

245
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,970
你認為我對那可憐的女人做了那些可怕的事
You think I did all those awfulthings to that poor woman.

246
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,140
-福伊爾先生  請聽我說  -我想我不會
- Mr. Foyle, please listen to me. - I don't think I will.

247
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,300
福伊爾先生
Mr Foyle.

248
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,630
我要他出去
I want him gone.

249
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,120
他是你的事務律師
He's your solicitor.

250
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,970
出去
Gone.

251
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,210
他讓我緊張
He was making me nervous.

252
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,570
要休息一下嗎
Do you want to take a minute?

253
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,570
瞪著我
Staring at me.

254
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,770
-福伊爾先生  -看著我的眼睛
- Mr Foyle. - Look me in the eye.

255
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,180
可以繼續了嗎
Shall we get on?

256
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,840
要不要來杯熱茶
How about a nice cup of tea?

257
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,920
福伊爾先生  我是你的辯護律師
Mr Foyle, I'm your defence barrister.

258
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,170
如果你以任何形式私下向我承認有罪
If you privately confessed your guilt to me in any way

259
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,610
但公開堅稱無罪
but publicly maintained your innocence,

260
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,500
我馬上跟著希姆金斯先生出去
I'd be following Mr Simkins there,

261
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:38,120
并且離開時鼓勵你承認有罪
and I would have encouraged you as I left to enter a guilty plea.

262
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,300
我沒有罪
I'm not guilty.

263
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,960
那么我們可以開始了
Then this is where we are.

264
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,820
你干得很不錯
Well, good job you're here then.

265
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,210
-令人振奮  -但愿如此
- Refreshing. - Let's hope so.

266
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,710
你做事的方式
Your manners.

267
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,950
-倒滿  -一點點就好
- Full? - Just a splash.

268
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,950
知道嗎  說來有趣
You know, it's funny.

269
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,710
和你相處越久
The more time we spend together,

270
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,140
就越覺得我們相似
the more you remind me of me.

271
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,190
好吧
Right.

272
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,460
-伯頓先生  -等一下
- Mr Burton? - Give me a minute.

273
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,270
-你沒事吧  -只是需要透透氣
- Are you all right? - I just need some air.

274
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,870
-麻煩給我一包萬寶路  -好
- Can I have 20 Marlboro Lights, please? - Yep.

275
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,660
-有的話再來一只打火機  -有
- And a lighter if you have got one. - Sure.

276
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,090
她來了  哈洛街57號升起的新星
Ah, here she is, the rising star at 57 Harlow Street.

277
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,440
瑪吉  我知道我應該無條件支持你
Now then, Maggie, I know I should really be rooting for you

278
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,280
可是你該明白
without exception, but you should know

279
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,910
第二也沒什么丟人的  你看巴茲·奧爾德林
there is no ignominy in coming second. Just ask Buzz Aldrin.

280
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,080
我要求重新計票
Well, I demand a recount.

281
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,520
-仿佛回到了律師學院辯論決賽  -是嗎
- Takes me back to Middle Temple Moot Finals. - Really?

282
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,030
是的  你和我  幾乎一模一樣
Yeah, you and me. Almost an exact replay.

283
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,630
那是很久以前的事情了
It was a long time ago.

284
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,350
聽說利亞姆·福伊爾的案子是你對我們朱利安
I heard you're up against our boy Julian on this Liam Foyle malarkey.

285
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,290
-是嗎  我們的朱利安  -是  很意外
- Is that so? Our boy? - Yes. Surprised it's not

286
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,070
對手竟然不是你  還真有點不習慣
you on the other side. Seem to be making a habit out of it.

287
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,860
我這不是給你機會挑戰下別人嗎
Thought I'd give you a go against someone else for a change.

288
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,840
-差不多了吧  -不嫌多
- Had enough, eh? - Never.

289
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,400
我在想是不是多做做辯護
I am just thinking of transitioning into more defence work.

290
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,570
-失陪了  -好的
- Excuse me. - Sure.

291
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,800
福伊爾這個案子對我來說太"猶大"了
Anyway, this Foyle case is a little too St Jude for my liking.

292
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,300
他是敗局的守護神
He's the patron saint of lost causes.

293
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,660
是嗎  我還不知道
Oh, I didn't know that.

294
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,880
好吧
Right, well,

295
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,500
-我再去找點酒來  -好的  謝謝
- I'll go and get us some more rubbing alcohol. - Great, thank you.

296
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,470
我是認真的  我看過案情摘要
I'm serious. I've seen the brief.

297
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,060
-你為什么接這個案子  -我是律師
- Why are you doing? - I'm practising law.

298
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,130
拜托  這根本是收拾不干凈的爛攤子
Oh, come on. It's almost a no-questions jobbie.

299
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,150
你就是想增加曝光度吧
It might be exposure for all the wrong reasons.

300
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,520
我才不是為了曝光度  瑪吉
I don't do things for exposure, Maggie.

301
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,780
那為什么接
Why do you do it?

302
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,260
因為每個人都有權申辯
Because everyone deserves a defence.

303
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,170
吹蠟燭吧
There you go.

304
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,950
-許愿吧  -老媽不要再煩我了  -沒錯
- Make a wish. - I wish my mum would stop annoying me. - Yes.

305
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,790
-誰要吃蛋糕  -我
- Who wants a piece of cake? - Me!

306
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,310
-真的嗎  -要吃  要吃
- Are you sure? - Yes! Yes! Yes!

307
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,180
好吧  你是說還要繼續調查嗎
OK, so you're saying there's more to find?

308
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,060
好的  能把一切都記錄在案嗎
Yeah. And would you go on record with that?

309
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,770
很好  好的  明天我讓事務所的人聯系你
Great. Great, OK. Someone from my office will call you tomorrow

310
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,160
我們約個時間
and set up an appointment.

311
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,860
謝謝  明天見  再見
Thanks. Thank you. Speak soon. Bye-bye.

312
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,350
-他是誰  -懂電腦的聰明人
- Who was that? - That's a clever man who knows about computers.

313
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,250
幫你備份大腦嗎
Is he going to back up your brain?

314
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,920
不是  工作上的事
No, it was for my work.

315
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,520
-他能幫你勝訴嗎  -但愿吧
- Will he help you win the case? - I hope so.

316
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,590
他們來了
Oh, here they come.

317
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,390
-凱特和孩子都好嗎  -很好  謝謝
- How's Kate and the family? - Very well, thank you.

318
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,310
瑪吉今天應該會來旁聽
I think Maggie's in the gallery today.

319
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,460
-為什么  -掂量掂量對手的能耐吧
- Why's she doing that? - Checking out the competition I expect.

320
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,100
當第一名就要有覺悟  威爾
That's the trouble with being number one, Will.

321
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,010
人人都想把你拉下馬來
Everyone wants to knock you off your perch.

322
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:15,120
我聽說你上周申請了延期審理
Now I heard you asked for an adjournment last week.

323
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,910
-是的  -遇到麻煩了嗎
- I did indeed. - Trouble at mill?

324
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,880
也不是  就是需要更多時間
Not really. Just needed more time.

325
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,350
怕是沒時間了  咱們都來了
Well, here we are, I'm afraid.

326
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,060
沒錯  都來了
Here we are indeed.

327
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,560
我真是喜歡你鐵面無私的表情  老兄
I must say, I do like your game face, old boy.

328
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,470
還沒到那個時候呢  兄弟
You haven't seen it yet, old boy.

329
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,460
有的罪行惡劣到無以言述
Some crimes defy description.

330
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,470
那是對文明一詞的玷污
They debase our so-called civilisation

331
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,350
公然挑釁人性的底線
and defy every boundary of humanity left to us.

332
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,340
殺害桑德拉·馬林斯的人
Now the person who took the life of Sandra Mullins

333
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,250
只能被稱作卑劣的施虐狂
can only be described as a malignant sadist,

334
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:55,110
他這種行徑是蓄意傷害  恐嚇
who did so with the intent to traumatise, to terrorise,

335
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,370
給予受害者非人的痛苦與折磨
and to inflict the maximum amount of pain and suffering.

336
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,590
控方力在證明  毫無疑問
And we intend to prove, without doubt,

337
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,590
這個人就是利亞姆·福伊爾
that that person was Liam Foyle.

338
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,560
脖子周圍有嚴重的瘀傷
Severe bruising around her neck,

339
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:12,120
甲狀軟骨和舌骨嚴重骨折
her thyroid cartilage and hyoid bone were badly fractured.

340
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,910
死因是勒殺
Cause of death was strangulation.

341
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,520
另外還有性侵犯
Other injuries were sexual in nature,

342
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,460
體內體外均造成傷害
internal and external,

343
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,000
未發現雙眼眼球
both eyes were missing,

344
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:29,240
是在死前或者更早時被強行取出的
removed with force close to the time of death, possibly before.

345
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,100
公園的植被覆蓋到了東北角
The park gets overgrown towards the north eastern corner.

346
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:36,310
有很深的草叢  山楂  薰衣草和蕁麻
Long grass, hawthorn, lavender, nettle beds.

347
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,760
你早上經過時發現了什么異樣嗎
And did you see anything unusual on your morning route?

348
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,420
我看到一個男人
I saw a man.

349
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,630
原本躺著  后來起身了
Getting up from a lying position.

350
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,530
休斯先生  依你的職業素養
Mr Hughes, in your professional capacity,

351
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:48,300
你能確認面前的這份信用卡交易記錄
can you please confirm the credit card statements before you

352
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,370
準確說明了這些交易是由你的銀行
are an accurate reflection of payments made by your bank

353
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,670
代表賬戶所有者利亞姆·福伊爾先生做的嗎
on behalf of the account holder, Mr Liam Foyle?

354
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,690
是的
Yes.

355
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,390
此卡的這些交易
And these payments were made by the card

356
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,860
都是在今年前三個月進行的  對嗎
over the first three months of this year, is that correct?

357
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:01,500
對
Yes.

358
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,010
并且都是網上在線
And they were all made online to companies

359
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,680
與亞洲和歐洲的公司交易
across Asia and Europe,

360
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:11,570
這些公司都傳播和制作相同的產品
all of which distribute and produce the same... product,

361
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,770
也就是淫穢作品  對吧
namely pornography, is that correct?

362
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,790
據我們所知是這樣的
Yes, that is our understanding.

363
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,440
休斯先生  大部分網站
Mr Hughes, many of these sites,

364
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,450
我們為了進行調查
and I'm afraid we have had to visit them

365
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,600
必須對其進行訪問
in the course of this investigation,

366
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,270
發現它們都含有極度惡劣的行為
have shown acts of extreme depravity

367
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,650
根據我們對法醫報告的研究
which, we understand from the forensic reports,

368
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,580
發現其與桑德拉·馬林斯被謀殺前
show disturbingly accurate similarities to the injuries

369
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,410
所受的傷害驚人的一致
that befell Sandra Mullins before she was murdered.

370
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:38,020
這里我特指身上的咬痕
I talk specifically in relation to the bite marks

371
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:42,400
-還有對生殖器的損毀  -胡說
- and the mutilation of genitalia. - Liar!

372
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,400
福伊爾先生  我只給你這一次機會
Mr Foyle! You have one chance with me, and that was it.

373
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,380
再違反秩序就算作藐視法庭
Any more from you and I shall hold you in contempt.

374
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,870
-殺人犯  -請安靜
- Murderer! - Silence, please!

375
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,160
休斯先生  請回答問題
Mr Hughes, please answer the question.

376
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,660
沒錯  是這張信用卡
Yes, it is the same card.

377
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,210
謝謝  沒有要問的了  法官大人
Thank you. No further questions, my Lord.

378

{\pos(255,75)}bei1暴民

379
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,030
伯頓先生
Mr Burton?

380
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,570
法官閣下  在庭審之前
My Lord, before this trial began

381
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,040
我提交過延期審理的書面申請
I made a written application for an adjournment.

382
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,790
鑒于現在缺少專家證詞
I'm asking you now to reconsider that

383
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,660
我希望您能重新考慮下那份申請
application in the light of the gravity of the expert testimony.

384
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,880
-拜托  -伯頓先生
- Oh, come on. - Mr. Burton.

385
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,490
你的請求非常不合時宜
This is most inappropriate.

386
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,390
我認為這期間能發現更多關鍵證據
I submit an adjournment will bring vital evidence to light.

387
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,030
雙方都可以讓專家參與
Let both sides have their expert,

388
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,090
再由陪審團做最終判斷
and let the jury decide.

389
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,380
伯頓先生
Mr Burton,

390
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,370
公眾對這起案件極為關注
there is huge public interest in having

391
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,760
希望能盡快進行審判
this case heard as soon as possible.

392
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,050
你的專家
The fact your expert

393
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,100
未能完成查驗證據的工作
has not mustered himself to the task at hand

394
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,350
本庭對此并不關心
is neither here nor there.

395
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,350
不是他效率低
He's not slow,

396
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,320
他正在收集可能的新證據
it's that he's gathering potentially new evidence.

397
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,450
那是同一臺電腦
It's the same computer.

398
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,540
雙方請的都是電腦取證的專家
Both of your experts are computer forensic specialists.

399
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,600
我不認為兩個訓練有素的人
I can hardly see how two trained men

400
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,030
檢查同一臺電腦
looking at the same equipment

401
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,410
會得出截然不同的結論
could produce so radically different conclusions

402
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,980
并對審判結果產生影響
that it would make a difference.

403
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,080
恐怕這是不可能的
I'm afraid it simply isn't on.

404
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,960
如果法官閣下能再仔細考慮...
I think if My Lord could look a little closer...

405
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,700
你的申請被拒了  這個決定不會更改
Your application was refused and it shall stay refused.

406
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,150
我不會因藐視法庭而處罰你
I will decline from pursuing you on contempt

407
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,060
但這是給你的最后一次警告
but let this be your last and final warning.

408
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,800
現在是午餐時間  暫時休庭
We'll break for lunch now.

409
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,330
木已成舟  伯頓先生
But the train is on the tracks, Mr Burton.

410
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,650
為了你的委托人著想
And for the sake of your client

411
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,830
你還是隨機應變為好
I suggest you deal with it.

412
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,580
-明白  法官閣下  -起立
- My Lord. - All rise.

413
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,480
威爾
Will?

414
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,530
你要睡會兒覺
You should try and sleep.

415
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,310
-我沒事  -我說真的
 - I'm fine. - I mean it.

416
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,630
你認為自己戰無不勝  但其實不是這樣
You think you're invincible, and you're not.

417
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,550
我們應該給這些窗戶換鎖
We should get new locks on these windows.

418
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,950
你聽到我的話了嗎
Were you even listening to me?

419
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,960
換成帶鑰匙的框架鎖
Frame locks, with keys.

420
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,060
我的天  接下來的兩個月
Oh, God. You're going to drive me crazy

421
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,080
你是要把我逼瘋嗎
for the next two months now, aren't you?

422
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:39,020
我的一位同事剛為一個十二歲男孩辯護
A colleague of mine just defended a 12-year-old boy

423
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,240
他把下水道清洗劑
who poured drain cleaner

424
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,770
灌進了好朋友的喉嚨
down the throat of his best mate

425
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,330
就因為他朋友不讓他用自己的手機玩游戲
because he wouldn't let him play a game on his phone.

426
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,120
什么世道
The world is broken.

427
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,630
你不該在睡覺前看恐怖電影的
You shouldn't watch scary movies so close to bedtime.

428
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,980
是啊
Yeah.

429
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,900
你的表現可沒給我什么信心  威爾
Not inspiring much confidence up there, Will.

430
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,920
我知道我在做什么  福伊爾先生
I know what I'm doing, Mr. Foyle.

431
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,730
我在那兒可沒看到
Not from where I'm sitting.

432
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,050
-那就解雇我  -為什么我要那么做
- So sack me. - Why would I want to do that?

433
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,560
你說呢
You tell me.

434
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,900
只要我受雇于你  就為你工作
I work for you as long as you'll have me.

435
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,100
我道歉  威爾  我知道你在盡力幫我
I apologise, Will. I know you've got my back.

436
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,320
很感謝你對我坦誠相待
I appreciate your honesty very much.

437
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,890
我們繼續吧
Shall we get on?

438
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,440
-你只有一臺電腦  對嗎  -沒錯
- You only have one computer, is that correct? - Yes.

439
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,700
但我不明白這與那女人的遭遇
But I don't see what that's got to do with

440
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,550
有什么關系
what happened to that woman.

441
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,430
你會明白的
You will.

442
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,840
必須有人為桑德拉·馬林斯的死付出代價
Someone must pay for what happened to Sandra Mullins.

443
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,400
我們面臨的是人性危機
Our very humanity is at stake,

444
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,390
正如我這位淵博的同行所說
as my learned friend has indicated.

445
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:37,890
如果利亞姆·福伊爾有罪的話
It would be convenient for everyone here today

446
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,980
對今天在座的人而言是順理成章的
if Liam Foyle was guilty.

447
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,010
戴上手銬后  他將永不能翻身
The cuffs go on and he's gone forever.

448
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,180
看上去似乎是鐵證如山
The evidence seems overwhelming.

449
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,270
但事實并非如此
But it is not.

450
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,530
可能福伊爾先生并不招人喜歡
We may dislike Mr. Foyle.

451
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,560
如果我們看到他走過來  可能都要繞道走
We might cross the street if we saw him coming.

452
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,100
但為他辯護并不需要喜歡他
But we do not have to like him to defend him.

453
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,700
因為這里并不是比人氣
Because this is not a popularity contest,

454
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,690
也不是搞政治迫害
this is not a witch-hunt,

455
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,670
這里是法庭
this is a court of law,

456
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,920
在這個國度  當你被指控犯罪時
and in this country, when you're accused of a crime

457
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,390
在最終被證明有罪前  都假定你是無辜的
you are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.

458
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,810
毫無疑問  我這位淵博的同行
And make no mistake, not a shred of what you've heard from

459
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,590
為檢方說的每一句話
my learned friend acting for the Prosecution

460
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,410
都是無憑無據的
has given any proof at all.

461
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,760
所展示的是不可靠的證人證詞
I will show you unreliable witnesses,

462
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,520
懶惰無能的法醫鑒定
lazy forensic science,

463
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,600
以及情感訴求  而不是事實真相
emotional appeals instead of factual accuracies.

464
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,270
就是如此  還妄自斷言我的委托人
Oh, yes, and the casual assertion that my client is

465
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,370
是極端色情片的消費者
a consumer of extreme pornography.

466
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,940
首先  我們來談談這一點
First, I think, we will talk about that.

467
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,010
我的專業是電腦取證和數據分析
I am an expert in forensic computer data analysis.

468
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,860
克羅博士  你檢查過福伊爾先生的
Dr. Crowe, have you had a chance to examine the hard drive of

469
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,900
電腦硬盤嗎
the computer belonging to Mr. Foyle?

470
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,010
檢查過
Yes, I have.

471
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,500
你是按照這起案件的
And you did this instructed by

472
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,340
檢察官的指示去做的  對嗎
the Prosecution in this case, is that correct?

473
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,370
是的
Yes.

474
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:03,380
遺憾的是  為辯方
And unfortunately Dr. Weeks, the gentleman

475
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,510
檢查電腦的威克斯博士
who has helped examine the computer for the Defence

476
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,830
還沒能完成他的工作
has not yet finished his work.

477
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,220
不過他把到目前為止的記錄給了我
However, he has passed me his notes to date

478
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,710
我想就此對你提幾個問題
and I'd like to ask you questions about them.

479
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,170
不論你使用電腦上過什么網站
Wherever you go on the internet, using a computer,

480
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,280
都會留下痕跡
you leave footprints.

481
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,830
-對嗎  -沒錯
- Is that correct? - Yes, it is.

482
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,790
即便把文件刪除了
Even if you've deleted a file,

483
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,210
像你這樣的專家還是能找出痕跡
someone like you is able to see it.

484
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,560
-通常是如此  -你到底想問什么
- Most of the time. - Where is this going?

485
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,450
在我的專家缺席的情況下  法官閣下
And in the absence of my own expert, My Lord,

486
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,570
我這位淵博的同行友好地
my learned friend has kindly

487
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,230
提供檢方的專家來參與審理此案
tendered the Prosecution expert on this matter.

488
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:35,470
我請求跟他探討一下這一點
I beg some time to explore this point with him.

489
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,550
好吧
Very well.

490
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:46,200
我淵博的同行斷言我的委托人
My learned friend alleges that my client paid for and viewed,

491
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,680
經常購買和觀看
on a regular basis,

492
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,720
大量不堪入目的圖片  包括
numerous depraved and abusive images, including...

493
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:58,020
"折磨  損毀  勒殺和奸尸的行為"
"Acts of torture, mutilation, strangulation, and necrophilia."

494
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,930
在你對他的電腦的分析中
Um, in your analysis of his computer,

495
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,590
你有否證實福伊爾先生
did you establish that Mr Foyle

496
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,730
確實訪問過那些圖片
had actually visited any of those websites that

497
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,230
所屬的網站嗎
pertained to those images?

498
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,170
-沒有  但他的信用卡賬單  -謝謝
- No, but his credit card bills... - Thank you.

499
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:14,130
我淵博的同行聲稱我的委托人用信用卡
And my learned friend asserted that my client paid for access

500
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,480
購買了那些網站的訪問權限
to many of those websites with his credit card.

501
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,300
那么
Now,

502
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,700
如果他沒有訪問這些網站  為什么要付錢呢
why would he pay for them if he didn't actually visit them?

503
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,650
這話說起來不中聽
It may sound reprehensible

504
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,550
但他付的錢沒有得到回報  不是嗎
but he's not getting his money's worth, is he?

505
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,790
如果他不訪問那些網站
How did he pay for access

506
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,030
那又是如何購買權限的呢
to those sites without actually visiting them?

507
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,390
在他的上網記錄中  他向許多色情網站
Many porn sites were on his internet history

508
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,550
提供了信用卡的信息
to which he submitted his credit card details.

509
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:42,640
這樣他就能得到一個解鎖其他內容的密碼
That's how he received a password to unlock other content elsewhere.

510
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,750
他的信用卡信息有沒有可能是偽造的呢
Is it possible that his card details were falsified at that point?

511
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,240
你是什么意思
How do you mean?

512
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,720
就是當他向成人網站提供信息時
That when he submitted his details to the adult site,

513
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,000
它們被
they were taken

514
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:00,250
未知的第三方盜取和利用
and used by unknown third parties

515
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,250
并用來購買和解鎖你所說的"其他內容"
to pay for and unlock this "other content" as you call it.

516
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,700
-有那種可能嗎  -我覺得有吧  有
- Is that possible? - I suppose so, yes.

517
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,860
考慮到這種可能性  如果我們能證明
So given this possibility, if we were to prove, in this court,

518
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,170
真的發生了信息偽造  那福伊爾先生
that such falsification occurred, would Mr Foyle be shown to be,

519
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,160
是不是就成了身份欺詐的受害者
in fact, a victim of identity fraud?

520
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,730
這不是有關極端色情的庭審
This is not a trial about extreme pornography,

521
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,410
而是審理令人發指的謀殺...
this is about the horrific murder...

522
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,450
我們的專家本來在證實其中的聯系
Our expert was in the process of proving this link.

523
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,890
因此我們所提出的延期申請被駁回了
Hence our application for an adjournment, which was refused.

524
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,460
我淵博的同行提出了一系列
My learned friend brought these hideous

525
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,960
聳人聽聞的主張  而我再次申請延期
allegations to bear on this case and I reiterate my request.

526
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,240
專家證詞對雙方都有影響
The expert testimony cuts both ways.

527
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,070
庭警  請帶陪審團離開
Usher, please excuse the jury.

528
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,420
剛剛出現了程序問題
A matter of procedure has just arisen,

529
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,890
我需要跟兩方都談一談
I need to talk to both sides about it.

530
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,390
我們很快就會叫你們回來
We will call you back presently.

531
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,970
去我的辦公室
My room, I think.

532
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,840
法官
Judge.

533
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,230
我的委托人被皇家檢察院
My client has been falsely

534
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,510
錯誤地戴上了極端色情愛好者的帽子
branded an extreme porn enthusiast by the Crown,

535
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,230
此事已經泄露到網絡社交媒體上
this has now leaked online to social media,

536
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,820
平面媒體也趁勢加以報道
where it's been duly picked up by the print media,

537
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,780
給我的委托人貼上了
which has now tainted my client

538
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,140
虐待狂  變態和戀尸癖的標簽
with the label torturer, pervert, necrophiliac,

539
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,860
所以這個陪審團必須解散
so much so this jury must be discharged

540
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,330
重新召集  即使有報道限制
and a new jury called. Even with the reporting restrictions,

541
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,010
考慮到本案已經產生的新聞
given the press this case has already generated,

542
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,510
福伊爾先生也得不到公正的審判
Mr Foyle cannot be given a fair trial.

543
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,240
-我申請停止起訴  -太荒唐了
- The inevitable application is to stay the indictment. - This is absurd.

544
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,490
我此時請求是恰當的
I made the request in good time.

545
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,540
-是  我知道  -陪審團對被告的偏見
- Yes, I know. - The prejudice to the accused

546
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,350
在我看來是永久性的
in the eyes of this jury is, in my view, permanent.

547
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,610
我雖不情愿  但這種情況下除了批準申請
Reluctantly, I feel that I have little option in these circumstances

548
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,460
-我別無選擇  -法官  拜托
- but to accede to your application. - Judge, please.

549
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,250
我沒有辦法  朱利安
I ballsed up, Julian.

550
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:01,350
抱歉  我們去結束這件事吧
I'm sorry. Let's get this over with.

551
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,450
所以  最終結果是  我別無選擇
And so, as a result, I have no alternative

552
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:11,070
只能解散陪審團并釋放被告
but to discharge the jury and release the defendant.

553
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,370
全體起立
All rise.

554
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,950
你應該感到羞愧
You should be ashamed of yourself!

555
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,220
-恭喜  干得好  -那是個漏洞
- Congratulations, well done. - It was a mistake.

556
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,990
我只是確保他們付出代價
I just made sure they paid for it.

557
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,750
威爾  好樣的
Will, good man.

558
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,020
-這是我的工作  -謝謝你  我的朋友
- Just doing my job. - Thank you, my friend.

559
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,160
不客氣  保重
Pleasure. Take care.

560
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,010
-再教我一次  -你自己來
- So show me again. - You do it.

561
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,340
好吧  但是別看著我
OK. But don't watch me,

562
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,660
你看著我就弄不好  我鴨梨山大
I can't do it if you watch. I'm like a kettle.

563
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,160
你鴨梨山大是什么意思
What do you mean you're like a kettle?

564
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,000
-弄好了我再告訴你  去吧  -好吧
- If I get this right I'll tell you. Go on. - OK.

565
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,530
"買衣服的時候要用  想要"
 "When buying clothing to say what you want, use... Gostaria."

566
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:48,260
-想要  -"我想要一件襯衫"
- Gostaria. - "I'd like a shirt. Gostaria uma camisa."

567
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,420
我想要一件襯衫
Gostaria uma camisa.

568
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:56,220
"我想要一條褲子  你想要一條褲子嗎"
"I'd like a pair of trousers. Gostaria umas calcas."

569
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,550
什么
What?

570
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,950
"要合適的尺碼
"To get the right size,

571
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,150
用下面的短語  我是40號"
use the following phrases. I am a size 40."

572

"我是40號"

我是4...40號

574
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,230
"如果他們沒有合適的顏色
"If they don't have the right colour,

575
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:13,000
要同樣款式的藍色就這樣說
here is how to ask for the same thing in blue.

576
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,360
這個有藍色的嗎"
Do you have this in blue?"

577
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,620
你在沖誰揮手
Who are you waving at?

578
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,550
我不知道
I don't know.

579
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,590
你不知道是什么意思
What do you mean you don't know?

580
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,880
那個男人  是他開始揮手的

581

Possibly. Listen, just take a deep breath and open the door,

585
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,600

我做不到  我有點怕

我們說好的  現在哪兒都找不見她
We had a deal. I can't see her anywhere.

591

He was looking in at me when I was in the bath.

Is it possible that one of your ex-clients has a point to prove?

636
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,940
可能你敗訴了  有過嗎
Someone you failed to defend, perhaps did some time?

挑揀案子是不允許的
Cherry-picking is frowned upon.

643

他怎么沒先來找我們
He didn't come to us first?

650
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:20,970
看來他是想讓你更難受些
Looks like he wanted to cause you maximum discomfort.

651
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:24,820
直接找法律監察員和律師標準委員會  難辦
Went straight to the Legal Ombudsman and the BSB. Both barrels.

652

真實性表達了質疑"
the validity and honesty of his plea."

658
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,300
什么
What?

659
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,780
