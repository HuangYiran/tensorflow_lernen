{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I was a child,

3
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:09,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my mother would tell me a story

4
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about how the Devil roams the Earth.

5
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,738
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes, she said, he would take human form

6
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so he could punish the damned on Earth before claiming their souls.

7
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The ones he chose would be gathered together

8
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:30,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and tortured as he hid amongst them, pretending to be one of them.

9
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always believed my mother was telling me an old wives' tale.

10
00:03:33,218 --> 00:03:36,186
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mother's story would always begin the same way,

11
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:40,256
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with a suicide paving the way for the Devil's arrival.

12
00:03:43,997 --> 00:03:48,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it would always end with the deaths of all those trapped.

13
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:10,645
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm good. I feel good. I feel amazing.

14
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:15,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know the main reason why people go back to drinking?

15
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:16,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

16
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guess.

17
00:04:18,198 --> 00:04:19,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Eagles.

18
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:21,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Resentment.

19
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:24,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are we seriously talking about this again?

20
00:04:25,073 --> 00:04:26,437
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's important.

21
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:28,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your ability to forgive is gonna determine

22
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:31,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the quality of the rest of your life more than anything else.

23
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:36,046
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, some things are beyond forgiveness.

24
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:37,783
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're already on your way.

25
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:39,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've taken responsibility for your actions.

26
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:41,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's more than half the battle right there.

27
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:43,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But to truly feel free,

28
00:04:45,927 --> 00:04:47,621
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you may need to finally start believing

29
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:49,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in something greater than yourself.

30
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:51,494
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That sounds good.

31
00:04:53,402 --> 00:04:54,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It does.

32
00:04:55,537 --> 00:04:58,699
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when I think about the guy that killed my family,

33
00:05:00,142 --> 00:05:02,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a tough time believing in much of anything.

34
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:06,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just saying, leave yourself open to it.

35
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:11,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we just have breakfast for once?

36
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:13,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Talk about normal stuff.

37
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm your sponsor. You can talk about normal stuff

38
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:15,948
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with everybody else.

39
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:25,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Got a good one for you.

40
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:26,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah?

41
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:52,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it doesn't make sense, right?

42
00:05:52,997 --> 00:05:56,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A guy hits a truck with this kind of force from a two-story building?

43
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Definitely a jumper.

44
00:05:57,969 --> 00:05:59,299
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure he wasn't thrown?

45
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:01,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got a rosary in his hand.

46
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,299
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not the kind of thing you grab in a panic.

47
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

48
00:06:10,882 --> 00:06:12,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Elsa. - Bowden.

49

50
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no glass on the ground.

51
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:33,965
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The truck wasn't here when he made impact. It must have rolled.

52
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:36,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh-huh.

53
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:44,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your guy jumped from that building.

54
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:47,616
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what? Your dead guy turned the corner, here?

55
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:52,815
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These things are made to bounce trucks off.

56
00:06:55,396 --> 00:06:57,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got to be kidding me.

57
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's walk it.

58
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:00,224
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

59

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Larson.

60
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Hey, lady, you got to sign in.

61
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Where's Ramsey? He knows me.

62
00:07:58,094 --> 00:07:59,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ramsey's out sick. You got me.

63
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,657
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that means you gotta sign in.

64
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:05,663
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, do I look like such a threat?

65
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:09,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't blame me. They got procedures.

66
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep dreaming, dawg.

67
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:20,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to cover the sign in.

68
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:22,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some lawyers on 39 need this right away.

69
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:24,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not taking the stairs again.

70
00:08:24,855 --> 00:08:26,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What else am I gonna do to stay in shape?

71
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,185
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To 39? Just get on the damn elevator.

00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:34,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's too tight for me.

74
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:36,091
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can squeeze in.

75
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You bet.

00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:05,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, see, this I can do.

81
00:09:05,798 --> 00:09:06,889
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you hold that?

82
00:09:06,966 --> 00:09:07,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh. Sorry.

00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh-uh, this is not good.

88
00:10:14,302 --> 00:10:16,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Timonen, put a stick on it.

00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:31,408

00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:42,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A full house. Two queens, three jacks.

95

99
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, the broken window.

00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:06,377

105
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,186
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? I'll ask your mom to read it for me

106
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:12,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}next time I got her bent over the console.

107
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom's 78. Have at it.

108
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:16,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ooh!

109
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Listen, buddy, just go up to the machine room

110
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:20,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and check it out, okay?

111
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On my way.

112
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just trying to get something to jump-start it.

113
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:42,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you have emergency procedures?

114
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:45,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, I'm just a temp. I just started working here.

115
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, don't you service these things?

116
00:11:48,634 --> 00:11:50,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try hitting the emergency button.

117
00:11:56,742 --> 00:11:59,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you keep up your equipment?

118
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Like I said...

119
00:12:02,948 --> 00:12:04,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you have a walkie-talkie?

120
00:12:04,384 --> 00:12:06,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I didn't think I'd need it.

121
00:12:07,086 --> 00:12:08,882
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't you think it would have been... - Won't you shut up?

122
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:10,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, take it easy.

123
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:12,023
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, seriously!

124
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:13,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have a walkie-talkie?

125
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, people, we see you in there.

126
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:16,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're stuck!

127
00:12:16,863 --> 00:12:19,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang tough, we got the building engineer on his way.

128
00:12:19,632 --> 00:12:22,259
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When was the last time you heard somebody say "hang tough"?

129
00:12:22,469 --> 00:12:26,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What did you say? - Nothing.

130
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:27,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is he picking a fight?

131
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:29,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can one of you look towards the camera

132
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:32,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and say something loud and clear, please?

133
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:37,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your building sucks!

134
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:39,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't hear you.

135
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:41,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The speaker in the car is supposed to let us talk both ways,

136
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:42,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you can hear me?

137
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,156
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's working on this end, yeah!

138
00:12:44,258 --> 00:12:45,884
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He just said he can't hear us,

139
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,551
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}didn't say we should talk louder.

140
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:50,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, um, give us a sec.

141
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:53,162
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, this is reassuring.

142
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:58,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got to be somewhere.

143
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:04,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not gonna get a signal in here.

144
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:07,811
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just need to call my job so I don't get fired over this.

145
00:13:09,685 --> 00:13:11,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Typical bullshit.

146
00:13:11,653 --> 00:13:13,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do any of y'all have a signal?

147
00:13:13,623 --> 00:13:15,021
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got one bar.

148
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,001
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? This is Larson.

149
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you please connect me to my job at the security desk?

150
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:39,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you hear me?

151
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:41,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell them to get us out of here!

152
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:43,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

153
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:50,983
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll just have to deal.

154
00:13:51,962 --> 00:13:53,861
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, at least we got tunes.

155
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:58,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't sit under that apple tree with anyone else but me

156
00:13:59,036 --> 00:14:00,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, grandma, you know the words.

157
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:01,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyone else but me

158
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,533
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be a jerk.

159
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:07,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Miss Manners.

160
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:09,168
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did I offend your noble sensibilities?

161
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you lay off, pal?

162
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:12,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you suck a butt?

163
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:14,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is great.

164
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:16,684
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just pick on the nice guy for bringing a little levity.

165
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:20,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we should all just stop talking for a while.

166
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:22,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure.

167
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:33,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I was just joking. I'm joking.

168
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Dwight, are you there yet?

169
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Almost.

170
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, look, man, I'm just glad you're dating again.

171
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just glad you're glad.

172
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:11,604
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what I meant. You know, after all your troubles...

173
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,338
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know what you meant.

174
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, how's that been going for you?

175
00:15:17,185 --> 00:15:18,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

176
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,148
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ninety days tomorrow.

177
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:22,384
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow, 90 days!

178
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It seems like just yesterday since we...

179
00:15:24,092 --> 00:15:25,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not to me, it doesn't.

180
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:38,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wouldn't happen to have a broken window up there, would you?

181
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:39,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

182
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:42,464
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Facing this direction?

183
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mmm-hmm.

184
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:46,203
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big enough to fit a person through it?

185
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:48,136
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I suppose.

186
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:50,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please stop sweeping.

187
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:52,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm declaring this a crime scene.

188
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:55,054
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Car 602.

189
00:15:55,991 --> 00:15:57,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell is that?

190
00:15:57,726 --> 00:15:58,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look out!

191
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:04,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You might want to secure that better.

192
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:05,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay!

193
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:08,926
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In her story, innocent people always die.

194
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:12,363
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Poor souls just trying to help out,

195
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:14,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who didn't realize what they were dealing with.

196
00:16:15,845 --> 00:16:18,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't take kindly to those who stand in his way.

197
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:23,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, old man.

198
00:16:23,219 --> 00:16:25,948
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't say inspection mode here. Circuits look fine.

199
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:27,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Try flipping elevator six.

200
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:30,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll tell the people in the car. You count to 20, then do it.

201
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:32,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cool.

202
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:38,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Inspected and certified August 12 by G. Carson. "

203
00:16:39,836 --> 00:16:42,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what do you say we go visit G. Carson when we're out of here?

204
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell him what we think of his inspecting prowess.

205
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:48,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People, we're gonna flip off the lights for one sec

206
00:16:48,212 --> 00:16:49,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to see if there's a short in the breaker.

207
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:50,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna cut off the power?

208
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:52,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does that mean we could drop?

209
00:16:52,684 --> 00:16:54,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be fine. I just didn't want you to...

210
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:56,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's happening? - Come on!

211
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,449
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing. Nothing. Just relax.

212
00:17:00,825 --> 00:17:01,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

213
00:17:01,926 --> 00:17:03,187
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get off me!

214
00:17:04,296 --> 00:17:05,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get off me!

215
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:08,059
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

216
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:15,268
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong with you, man?

217
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I was younger, my brother locked me in a trunk

218
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:25,045
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for six hours.

219
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:27,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have trouble with tight spaces.

220
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:29,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, great.

221
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:45,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

222
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:01,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we get out through that?

223
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:03,379
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you gonna do? Shimmy up the cables?

224
00:18:04,658 --> 00:18:06,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be a lot safer in here.

225
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:09,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anybody know where the bathroom is in this thing?

226
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,728
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did it work?

227
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:13,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nope, they're still stuck.

228
00:18:14,202 --> 00:18:16,601
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me go check the mains in the basement.

229
00:18:23,177 --> 00:18:25,371
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, thanks a lot. Wow.

230
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:27,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on?

231
00:18:28,216 --> 00:18:29,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know that window on 35?

232
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:30,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

233
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:32,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like somebody might have jumped through it.

234
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:36,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today?

235
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:37,618
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. This morning.

236
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for bearing with us, people.

237
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:44,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should get you back on line in a few minutes.

238
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:46,228
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been minutes.

239
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:48,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long is it going to take?

240
00:18:54,376 --> 00:18:57,276
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When we get out of here, you're gonna need a good rest.

241
00:18:58,581 --> 00:18:59,911
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Mattress Mania"?

242
00:19:00,316 --> 00:19:04,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's us. Everybody's had their mattress too long. Am I right?

243
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:08,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't follow that advice about flipping it every few months

244
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:11,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now you've worn a groove into it,

245
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:14,058
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you think, "Well, I'm used to it.

246
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,495
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"So, hey. But I do miss the way it felt

247
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:18,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"when it came fresh out of that bag. "

248
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:21,532
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at those shoes, they've been through the mill.

249
00:19:21,738 --> 00:19:26,071
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're saying, "Someone deserves a better place to lie down. "

250
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:28,002
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you insulting my shoes?

251
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:32,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The point is, a new mattress will cost a lot less than you think.

252
00:19:32,683 --> 00:19:35,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have to be as well-off as this one.

253
00:19:35,353 --> 00:19:37,286
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not that well-off.

254
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:41,046
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What makes me good at selling mattresses

255
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is I can look at a person's clothes

256
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and know exactly how much they can afford to spend.

257
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:51,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you, lady, you're no Super Sleeper.

258
00:19:52,336 --> 00:19:58,206
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God. They keep playing this song over and over and over.

259
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:01,536
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't they just turn the music off?

260
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:06,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you just touch my ass?

261
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? You wish, sweetheart.

262
00:20:10,056 --> 00:20:13,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know who you think you are, but keep your hands off me.

263
00:20:15,294 --> 00:20:16,624
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever.

264
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:20,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh!

265
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:25,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They must be working on the lights again.

266
00:20:28,007 --> 00:20:29,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Dwight.

267
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dwight.

268
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:31,965
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm here. I'm heading into the pit.

269
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:34,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They just lost power in number six again. Is that you?

270
00:20:34,814 --> 00:20:36,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you can't do that from here, D.L.

271
00:20:37,484 --> 00:20:39,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh. That's strange.

272
00:20:40,153 --> 00:20:41,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm looking at elevator six right now.

273
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:43,378
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't see anything wrong with it.

274
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:46,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The lights keep shorting out. The passengers are getting scared.

275
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:48,325
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See if this helps.

276
00:20:50,931 --> 00:20:52,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, come on.

277
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God.

278
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:55,025
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, come on.

279
00:20:55,102 --> 00:20:56,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything?

280
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:58,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No change.

281
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,566
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only other thing I can think to do

282
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:02,801
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}would be going back up to the roof, climbing down

283
00:21:02,876 --> 00:21:04,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and resetting the car manually.

284
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,707
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, yeah. Good. Do that, do that. Call me when you get there.

285
00:21:07,915 --> 00:21:09,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

286
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:28,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

287
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:45,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

288
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:02,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

289
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:07,473
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of here.

290
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:12,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Off you go. Off you go. There you go.

291
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:24,719
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh!

292
00:22:30,835 --> 00:22:32,426
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit!

293
00:22:32,503 --> 00:22:34,163
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Inspected by G. Carson. "

294
00:22:36,507 --> 00:22:37,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that?

295
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:38,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

296
00:22:40,145 --> 00:22:41,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought I heard...

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you all right?

300

00:23:14,614 --> 00:23:16,444
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on in there?

306

00:23:23,257 --> 00:23:24,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, see that?

310
00:23:26,192 --> 00:23:27,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What in the world?

311
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:29,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God.

312
00:23:34,335 --> 00:23:35,665
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's he saying?

313
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't tell what he's saying.

314
00:23:38,572 --> 00:23:40,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't tell what you're trying to say.

315
00:23:42,743 --> 00:23:45,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn off the... Turn off the music!

316
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe they don't like the music.

317
00:23:48,382 --> 00:23:50,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The music's still on? - Yeah.

318
00:23:50,318 --> 00:23:52,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn it off. It's probably driving them nuts.

319
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,482
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. How?

320
00:23:54,656 --> 00:23:57,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a kill switch right behind the...

321
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right under the key box.

322
00:24:06,635 --> 00:24:07,965
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you!

323
00:24:08,603 --> 00:24:10,263
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to her?

324
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It feels like something bit me.

325
00:24:14,442 --> 00:24:16,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait. Does anybody have anything sharp on them

326
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:17,804
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that might have cut her,

327
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- she might have cut herself on? - No.

328
00:24:22,018 --> 00:24:23,348
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why you got blood on you, man?

329
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,081
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She fell into me.

330
00:24:29,158 --> 00:24:30,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you cut her?

331
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:32,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No. No, something must have happened to her

332
00:24:32,563 --> 00:24:34,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then she fell into me.

333
00:24:34,297 --> 00:24:35,558
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She probably did it to herself!

334
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:37,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on! - Bit her own back?

335
00:24:37,868 --> 00:24:38,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think this is a bite?

336
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:40,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, nobody got bit.

337
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:41,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What else could have done that?

338
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll tell you. - I don't know.

339
00:24:43,206 --> 00:24:44,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A serrated blade could have.

340
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:46,299
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wouldn't happen to have a knife with

341
00:24:46,376 --> 00:24:47,899
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a serrated blade on you, would you?

342
00:24:47,978 --> 00:24:49,103
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

343
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:51,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. You mind if we search your pockets?

344
00:24:52,716 --> 00:24:54,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I do mind. You mind if we search yours?

345
00:24:54,418 --> 00:24:55,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go right ahead.

346
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe she has a serrated blade on her!

347
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,846
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you seriously suggesting that I would do this to myself?

348
00:24:59,924 --> 00:25:00,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

349
00:25:01,058 --> 00:25:03,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me another reason to kick your ass.

350
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:05,351
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, bro, take it easy, okay?

351
00:25:05,597 --> 00:25:06,654
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bro?

352
00:25:08,699 --> 00:25:10,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not your bro.

353
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you turn towards the camera

354
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:16,463
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and show us what happened to you, please?

355
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:22,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God. Whoa!

356
00:25:26,986 --> 00:25:28,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, we gotta call the police.

357
00:25:43,268 --> 00:25:46,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a possible 240 at 333 Locust Street.

358
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:50,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}333 Locust? That's gotta be right around...

359
00:25:52,912 --> 00:25:54,071
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...here.

360
00:25:54,948 --> 00:25:56,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Strange.

361
00:25:56,215 --> 00:25:59,843
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}602 responding. Happen to be right outside. Put me on it.

362
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Copy that, 602.

363
00:26:01,087 --> 00:26:02,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's convenient.

364
00:26:02,656 --> 00:26:05,385
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't make the calls, they just come for me.

365
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:06,685
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go.

366
00:26:09,262 --> 00:26:10,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Markowitz!

367
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:14,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, how's your girlfriend?

368
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:15,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up.

369
00:26:22,575 --> 00:26:23,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

370
00:26:24,345 --> 00:26:26,005
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought I saw something.

371
00:26:26,947 --> 00:26:28,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean? Like what?

372
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:30,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something.

373
00:26:37,124 --> 00:26:38,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. You see it?

374
00:26:39,493 --> 00:26:41,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, yeah. Look, that's just...

375
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's just grain in the image.

376
00:26:43,397 --> 00:26:44,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's, you know... It's a mistake.

377
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:47,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like when people see Jesus in a pancake or something.

378
00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:48,964
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No. No.

379
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:57,939
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ramirez. Ramirez, you're freaking me out. Come on.

380
00:26:59,214 --> 00:27:02,808
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey. Hey, listen to me.

381
00:27:03,885 --> 00:27:06,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to convey calm. These people are relying on us, okay?

382
00:27:06,488 --> 00:27:08,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So stop this shit right now.

383
00:27:08,925 --> 00:27:10,221
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

384
00:27:21,704 --> 00:27:23,295
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

385
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:32,771
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even know why we're trying this.

386
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:35,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're in the express shaft.

387
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's not gonna be another opening till the 23rd floor.

388
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:39,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we're close.

389
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could this elevator fall?

390
00:27:41,191 --> 00:27:42,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I doubt it.

391
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:46,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because we gotta be 20 floors up, just dangling over nothing.

392
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we stop talking about this, please?

393
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:51,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One more time.

394
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On three. One...

395
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, no, no.

396
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:57,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay away from me, man.

397
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can help. I want to get out of here, too.

398
00:27:59,843 --> 00:28:03,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you sit your creepy ass down in the corner over there?

399
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can all keep an eye on you.

400
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you ready? On three.

401
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One, two...

402
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:15,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three.

403
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,553
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just over here.

404
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:25,499
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And why do you think this might be an assault?

405
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:28,163
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She seemed to be having words with one of the other passengers

406
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just before it happened,

407
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:31,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now it looks like they're all keeping an eye on him.

408
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,009
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which guy? That guy, right there.

409
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,236
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do we have communication?

410
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,606
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we have an open line here.

411
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can talk, but we can't hear.

412
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:44,177

414

418
00:28:54,968 --> 00:28:56,867
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This engineer work for you guys or the elevator company?

422
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,769
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And have the Fire Department send some guys.

423

424
00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:06,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least one of your staff is aboard.

425
00:29:06,714 --> 00:29:08,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah, the guard there, he's a temp, actually.

426
00:29:08,982 --> 00:29:11,415
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ben something. I don't know. He started yesterday.

427
00:29:11,485 --> 00:29:14,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Call the temp agency and get all the info they have on him.

428
00:29:15,823 --> 00:29:17,016
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the others?

429
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:18,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't have names for the others.

430
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:20,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - He should see the face.

431
00:29:20,495 --> 00:29:21,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No. - What face?

432
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:23,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No. Nothing. - I saw a face.

433
00:29:23,664 --> 00:29:25,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look, there's no face. - Tell him about the face.

434
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:28,959
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Look, Ramirez is kind of religious. Just ignore him. Trust me.

435
00:29:30,104 --> 00:29:31,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to get a sense of who you all are.

436
00:29:31,707 --> 00:29:33,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it right now, comprende?

437
00:29:33,642 --> 00:29:35,131
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One at a time, I'd like you to hold up

438
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:36,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your driver's license to the camera

439
00:29:36,745 --> 00:29:38,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I know who I'm talking to.

440
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,242
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a good idea.

441
00:29:40,315 --> 00:29:41,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

442
00:29:41,783 --> 00:29:42,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

443
00:29:48,057 --> 00:29:50,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try and get it closer to the camera.

444
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,988
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The letters are too small.

445
00:29:53,997 --> 00:29:55,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there a sharpness setting on this thing?

446
00:29:55,764 --> 00:29:58,163
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, that's as good as it gets, right there.

447
00:29:58,368 --> 00:30:00,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can put your ID's away. Thanks.

448
00:30:01,738 --> 00:30:03,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do any of you have a pen on you?

449
00:30:06,175 --> 00:30:07,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one?

450
00:30:14,385 --> 00:30:15,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you go.

451
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to account for everyone on the visitors' log.

452
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,747
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find out which of these people

453
00:30:20,824 --> 00:30:21,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}didn't show up for their appointment.

454
00:30:22,026 --> 00:30:23,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got it.

455
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure?

456
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:30,008
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

457
00:30:39,393 --> 00:30:41,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep him away from me.

458
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Must be working on the power again.

459
00:30:58,847 --> 00:31:01,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The geniuses have done a bang-up job so far.

460
00:31:36,286 --> 00:31:37,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any other exits?

461
00:31:37,788 --> 00:31:39,186
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, sir, that's everything.

462
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. I got some info on your guard.

463
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:42,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have you got?

464
00:31:42,626 --> 00:31:44,456
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check this out. We got...

465
00:31:44,596 --> 00:31:46,426
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Something else is happening.

466
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is he dead?

467
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:12,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}602, we have a possible 187. I need backup.

468
00:32:13,124 --> 00:32:14,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you rewind this thing?

469
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:18,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rewind, fast forward and that's frame-to-frame.

470
00:32:18,597 --> 00:32:19,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frame-to-frame.

471
00:32:20,198 --> 00:32:21,494
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone, just keep breathing.

472
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:24,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna get you through this. Just take it easy, okay?

473
00:32:24,937 --> 00:32:27,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So today, someone committed suicide,

474
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:30,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a woman got hurt, now a man is dead.

475
00:32:30,175 --> 00:32:31,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, what are you trying to say?

476
00:32:33,145 --> 00:32:35,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, how many times have you seen a child fall

477
00:32:35,614 --> 00:32:38,241
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and barely miss the edge of the table with their head?

478
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:40,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is it so rare that they hit it?

479
00:32:40,352 --> 00:32:41,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get to your point.

480
00:32:45,025 --> 00:32:46,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look.

481
00:32:51,197 --> 00:32:53,926
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? You're embarrassing yourself.

482
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:56,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When he's near, everything goes wrong.

483
00:32:57,404 --> 00:33:01,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Toast falls jelly-side down, children hit tables

484
00:33:01,775 --> 00:33:02,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and people get hurt.

485
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. The police do not want to hear this stuff, Ramirez. Okay?

486
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:06,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So just stop. Now.

487
00:33:06,147 --> 00:33:08,205
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes he takes human form

488
00:33:08,415 --> 00:33:12,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and torments the damned on Earth before stealing them away.

489
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where I come from, we call it

490
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Devil's Meeting.

491
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:18,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this guy for real?

492
00:33:18,793 --> 00:33:21,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I'm sorry. Ramirez.

493
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,495
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must consider that one of those people

494
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:29,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- might be the Devil. - All right. Come on.

495
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:30,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you to stop telling campfire stories

496
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,699
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and get your head in the game.

497
00:33:32,774 --> 00:33:34,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. It's all right.

498
00:33:34,442 --> 00:33:36,299
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Markowitz, look at this guy right here.

499
00:33:36,443 --> 00:33:37,534
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

500
00:33:37,913 --> 00:33:41,678
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lights go down, they come back up,

501
00:33:42,217 --> 00:33:43,979
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he's closer, but he's moving away.

502
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:45,885
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What were you saying about the guard?

503
00:33:45,954 --> 00:33:48,251
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Yeah. He's a real piece of work.

504
00:33:49,758 --> 00:33:52,248
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Assault, assault, assault.

505
00:33:52,662 --> 00:33:55,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beat a guy into a coma with a baseball bat. That's great.

506
00:33:55,697 --> 00:33:58,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These the kind of guys you hire for security?

507
00:33:58,234 --> 00:34:00,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like I said, he's just a temp.

508
00:34:00,403 --> 00:34:01,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some temp.

509
00:34:03,906 --> 00:34:06,465
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could that mirror break from him hitting it?

510
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:12,738
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then how did...

511
00:34:12,815 --> 00:34:14,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that cop doing out there?

512
00:34:18,254 --> 00:34:20,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's probably trying to figure out

513
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:23,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which one of us is the murderer.

514
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:52,553
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the story, men would always try to fight him with force,

515
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but some battles can't be fought with weapons.

516
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:56,988
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you all please clear a space

517
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}between the camera and the body

518
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I can see him?

519
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:03,333
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't touch the body. This is a crime scene now.

520
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:04,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Though I know you're stuck in there,

521
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,498
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I expect you to do as little damage to it

522
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,299
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as humanly possible, got it?

523
00:35:09,742 --> 00:35:11,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any luck with the elevator company?

524
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're out of business.

525
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,539
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess that figures.

526
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:19,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A shard of glass sliced up and into the jugular.

527
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:20,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is definitely not an accident.

528
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:28,721
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who chooses a contained room with three witnesses for a killing?

529
00:35:29,062 --> 00:35:31,621
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unless they're so worked up, they can't control themselves.

530
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:35,357
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These people are shook up, but they don't look murderous.

531
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,536
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm missing something here.

532
00:35:46,012 --> 00:35:48,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need a volunteer to help me out.

533
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:55,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a piece of paper hanging out of his pocket.

534
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,983
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very carefully, I want you to take it out and hold it up to the camera.

535
00:36:16,645 --> 00:36:19,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Vince. " It looks like "McCormick. "

536
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The return address is for the Better Business Bureau.

537
00:36:22,184 --> 00:36:23,775
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They have an office on 35.

538
00:36:24,586 --> 00:36:26,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You got a freight elevator? - Yeah.

539
00:36:37,299 --> 00:36:39,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never seen a person die.

540
00:36:42,938 --> 00:36:44,666
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neither have I.

541
00:36:45,742 --> 00:36:47,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's pretty awful, huh?

542
00:36:49,646 --> 00:36:51,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what, you have?

543
00:36:53,815 --> 00:36:56,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I spent some time in Afghanistan.

544
00:36:58,655 --> 00:37:01,054
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see some things you wish you hadn't.

545
00:37:03,326 --> 00:37:05,293
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, so you've been trained to kill people?

546
00:37:16,106 --> 00:37:17,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's your jumper shaping up?

547
00:37:17,775 --> 00:37:18,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

548
00:37:19,777 --> 00:37:23,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you take a look at this suicide note? Most of it makes sense,

549
00:37:23,147 --> 00:37:26,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but then it ends with, "I can hear the Devil's footsteps draw near. "

550
00:37:29,086 --> 00:37:32,486
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Usually, suicide notes are either all crazy or all rational,

551
00:37:32,557 --> 00:37:34,046
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but this one's both.

552
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,152
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's strange, isn't it?

553
00:37:38,096 --> 00:37:39,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it is.

554
00:37:44,336 --> 00:37:46,428
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This one? Elevator key.

555
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:50,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Key's not catching.

556
00:37:50,842 --> 00:37:52,468
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Try the Halligan.

557
00:37:54,614 --> 00:37:56,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something's jamming it.

558
00:37:58,818 --> 00:37:59,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, if I can...

559
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I can get up there, I can maybe figure out what's wrong with this thing.

560
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:10,625
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a mechanic. I'm pretty good with this sort of thing.

561
00:38:18,471 --> 00:38:21,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's trying to escape. He's trying to escape.

562
00:38:21,908 --> 00:38:23,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's trying to escape!

563
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:25,103
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's trying to escape! - Stop! Stop!

564
00:38:25,212 --> 00:38:27,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it! Stop! What are you doing?

565
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell are you doing?

566
00:38:32,552 --> 00:38:35,418
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're all gonna stay right here until this thing is over.

567
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,649
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You knew what I was doing! I told you what I was doing!

568
00:38:37,758 --> 00:38:39,054
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know you!

569
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:45,056
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not our policy to discuss cases under review.

570
00:38:45,132 --> 00:38:48,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It kind of damages the reputations of our member businesses.

571
00:38:48,236 --> 00:38:49,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, someone just killed him on his way here.

572
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:53,029
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to know who knew he was coming here and who wanted him dead.

573
00:38:54,409 --> 00:38:57,241
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The line would stretch around the block.

574
00:38:57,812 --> 00:38:59,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The guy was a real scumbag.

575
00:38:59,814 --> 00:39:02,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three years ago, he started one of those Ponzi schemes

576
00:39:02,584 --> 00:39:04,983
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and when it collapsed, a lot of people lost their asses.

577
00:39:05,253 --> 00:39:06,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One guy even killed himself over it.

578
00:39:07,021 --> 00:39:08,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have a list of people that got burned by him?

579
00:39:08,824 --> 00:39:10,814
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah, the ones that filed. - I'm gonna need it.

580
00:39:11,092 --> 00:39:14,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what do you say we get to know each other a little bit better?

581
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here. Come on. Frisk me. Search me.

582
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See that I'm not carrying anything suspicious.

583
00:39:23,372 --> 00:39:24,463
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

584
00:39:35,685 --> 00:39:37,174
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're next.

585
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a good chance one of our people didn't sign in.

586
00:39:45,495 --> 00:39:46,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's that?

587
00:39:46,696 --> 00:39:48,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause that person might be on this list.

588
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:49,154
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's this?

589
00:39:49,232 --> 00:39:51,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our victim lost a lot of people a lot of money.

590
00:39:51,235 --> 00:39:52,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are the ones that filed complaints.

591
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:55,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The killer's probably smart enough not to be on both lists.

592
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,468
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look for the one that didn't sign in.

593
00:39:57,975 --> 00:39:59,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you just want video of the guy who died,

594
00:39:59,476 --> 00:40:00,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or also the girl that got hurt?

595
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:02,468
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All of it since they got in the car.

596
00:40:02,546 --> 00:40:03,569
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

597
00:40:03,647 --> 00:40:04,806
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Detective.

598
00:40:07,184 --> 00:40:08,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see?

599
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,916
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what you're talking about?

600
00:40:12,623 --> 00:40:14,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody believes in him a little bit,

601
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:17,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}even guys like you who pretend they don't.

602
00:40:32,511 --> 00:40:33,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's this?

603
00:40:36,282 --> 00:40:39,472
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An apology note left at the site of a hit-and-run.

604
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,081
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My wife and son were killed down on Bethlehem Pike five years ago,

605
00:40:46,325 --> 00:40:50,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but that's okay, because whoever did it is sorry.

606
00:40:52,398 --> 00:40:54,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can tell by the heartfelt apology

607
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on the back of a car wash coupon.

608
00:40:56,335 --> 00:40:59,235
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, no, I don't believe in the Devil. We don't need him.

609
00:40:59,673 --> 00:41:02,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People are bad enough by themselves.

610
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:05,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop the tape.

611
00:41:05,913 --> 00:41:07,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back it up.

612
00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:08,945
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Faster, faster.

613
00:41:09,549 --> 00:41:11,015
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There. Now, play it.

614
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:14,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was acting like he grabbed her.

615
00:41:17,925 --> 00:41:19,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is she up to?

616
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:25,295
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Folks, do me a favor, keep your hands off each other.

617
00:41:25,365 --> 00:41:28,265
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave the police work to me. I'll be in there any moment.

618
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:30,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Won't I?

619
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:53,723
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it.

620
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:58,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't like him touching me. He's touching me.

621
00:41:58,501 --> 00:41:59,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't like it!

622
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:00,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop pushing him onto me.

623
00:42:01,237 --> 00:42:02,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stand back.

624
00:42:02,537 --> 00:42:03,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hell, no. I know you're not doing

625
00:42:03,806 --> 00:42:05,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what it looks like you're doing!

626
00:42:05,174 --> 00:42:06,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spray that in here, you're gonna blind all of us.

627
00:42:06,909 --> 00:42:08,205
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll do it. - Seriously, put it down.

628
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:09,334
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lady...

629
00:42:15,918 --> 00:42:20,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dwight, where are you? You gotta stop disappearing, seriously.

630
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dwight.

631
00:42:22,691 --> 00:42:23,816
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang on a sec.

632
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:27,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dwight, you gotta get us in that car right now. Where are you?

633
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:30,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't.

634
00:42:31,668 --> 00:42:33,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dwight, I need you to stay on walkie!

635
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,766
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man...

636
00:42:41,078 --> 00:42:43,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you see this? Huh? You see this?

637
00:42:47,051 --> 00:42:50,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Use by October 21, 1987."

00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:52,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was scared. Relax.

639
00:42:52,723 --> 00:42:54,451
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She tried to pepper spray me, man!

640
00:43:03,268 --> 00:43:04,825
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dwight, where are you?

641
00:43:05,202 --> 00:43:06,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're being saved.

642

644
00:43:13,779 --> 00:43:15,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They hear something.

645
00:43:15,681 --> 00:43:18,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They hear your guy moving in the shaft.

646
00:43:18,449 --> 00:43:20,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then how come he's not answering?

647
00:43:20,586 --> 00:43:23,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dwight? Dwight, this is serious. You need to pick up, Dwight.

648
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:26,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you!

656
00:44:17,111 --> 00:44:18,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What floor did Dwight enter the shaft from?

657
00:44:19,013 --> 00:44:20,775
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He entered from the roof.

658
00:44:23,585 --> 00:44:24,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are they looking at?

659
00:44:25,253 --> 00:44:27,584
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dwight. Dwight, pick up.

660
00:44:52,715 --> 00:44:56,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like he fell. He's impaled right on top of the elevator.

661
00:44:56,552 --> 00:44:58,382
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurt real bad. Possibly dead.

662
00:45:03,959 --> 00:45:05,926
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Bowden, I think the people in the elevator

663

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}can hear our radios.

664
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,323
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's confirmed.

665
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:14,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you switch to channel eight?

666
00:45:15,237 --> 00:45:17,295
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The car's stuck on 21.

667
00:45:17,441 --> 00:45:19,465
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Markowitz, tell the Fire Department looks like they have to

668
00:45:19,543 --> 00:45:21,601
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}go through the wall on 21.

669
00:45:21,878 --> 00:45:24,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Lustig. You can't just go through the wall.

670
00:45:24,981 --> 00:45:25,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure we can.

671
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why you have insurance.

672
00:45:31,588 --> 00:45:33,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire command, go to eight, please.

673
00:45:38,229 --> 00:45:39,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There she is.

674
00:45:39,397 --> 00:45:40,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sarah Caraway.

675
00:45:40,498 --> 00:45:42,658

676
00:45:42,734 --> 00:45:43,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we know McCormick.

677
00:45:43,835 --> 00:45:45,699
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What other names are unaccounted for?

678
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:50,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jane something. Looks like "Kowski. " The older woman.

679
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,739
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find me footage of this guy.

680
00:45:56,314 --> 00:45:57,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This way, ma'am.

681
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:00,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's go. - All clear.

682
00:46:04,556 --> 00:46:06,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, this time slow.

683
00:46:13,532 --> 00:46:14,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta be kidding me.

684
00:46:14,934 --> 00:46:16,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did she just steal that lady's wallet?

685
00:46:16,368 --> 00:46:19,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So Vince was a scam artist, this woman Jane's a thief,

686
00:46:19,605 --> 00:46:22,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sarah there is a liar and our guard is a thug.

687
00:46:23,308 --> 00:46:25,298
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quite the crew we have here.

688
00:46:26,379 --> 00:46:28,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I still haven't seen this guy here.

689
00:46:32,652 --> 00:46:33,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that?

690
00:46:34,187 --> 00:46:35,551
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. Hard drive crash.

691
00:46:35,655 --> 00:46:36,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got it. Number 2.

692
00:46:40,126 --> 00:46:41,183
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go.

693
00:46:43,363 --> 00:46:45,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any other angle on the lobby?

694
00:46:45,932 --> 00:46:47,626
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just the main entrance.

695
00:46:48,769 --> 00:46:49,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There.

696
00:46:52,005 --> 00:46:53,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, rewind back.

697
00:46:54,942 --> 00:46:56,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Faster.

698
00:46:58,078 --> 00:46:59,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he is. Stop it.

699
00:47:05,052 --> 00:47:06,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's that satchel?

700
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:15,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't... There's no satchel in the elevator.

701
00:47:20,902 --> 00:47:22,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

702
00:47:23,572 --> 00:47:24,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

703
00:47:25,173 --> 00:47:26,503
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's happening?

704
00:47:28,777 --> 00:47:30,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't take this anymore!

705
00:47:30,479 --> 00:47:32,378
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't come near me, any of you!

706
00:47:32,514 --> 00:47:34,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe, if I could just check the wiring...

707
00:47:49,732 --> 00:47:51,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell's going on?

708
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:05,041
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please. Please turn on the light.

709
00:48:06,816 --> 00:48:09,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn on the lights!

710
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:26,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it. Shut down the building.

711
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring everyone down to the lobby.

712
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:30,299
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody comes in or out but us.

713
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which guy do you think is doing this?

714
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:36,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are three people in there and they're all capable.

715
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:37,743
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, she's not doing it.

716
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:40,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm ruling nobody out.

717
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:42,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire Department wants to know if you have a shut-off valve

718
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:44,015
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before they get through the wall, just in case.

719
00:48:44,256 --> 00:48:47,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's in the basement.

720
00:48:50,129 --> 00:48:51,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll go.

721
00:48:56,068 --> 00:48:57,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're bad people, that's why they're here.

722
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:00,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, two of them are here because they just got on the wrong elevator.

723
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, and I just happened to have the wrong job

724
00:49:03,175 --> 00:49:05,301
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you just happened to take the wrong call.

725
00:49:12,752 --> 00:49:14,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He never does this in secret.

726
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a reason we're the audience.

727
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:27,326
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on.

728
00:49:27,535 --> 00:49:29,001
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one's getting in this building right now.

729
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:30,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. I'm supposed to meet somebody upstairs.

730
00:49:30,503 --> 00:49:32,493
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna have to call them and tell them you can't make it.

731
00:49:32,573 --> 00:49:34,005
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you just tell me what's happening?

732
00:49:34,075 --> 00:49:36,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He always kills the last victim

733
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:38,008
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in front of the person they love most

734
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to make cynics of us all.

735
00:49:41,548 --> 00:49:43,174
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. Don't touch her.

736
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna leave her just hanging there.

737
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where you gonna put her?

738
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:49,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't thought that far ahead.

739
00:49:56,998 --> 00:49:58,658
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Funny how all this stuff starts happening

740
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:00,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}right after you start working here.

741
00:50:00,535 --> 00:50:02,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seems to me, you're the only one

742
00:50:02,103 --> 00:50:03,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who knew where the cables are.

743
00:50:17,986 --> 00:50:19,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

744
00:50:21,924 --> 00:50:23,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trying to close her eyes.

745
00:50:26,629 --> 00:50:30,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That doesn't work, not until they're dead for a few hours.

746
00:50:36,806 --> 00:50:38,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, you enter the building with a satchel.

747
00:50:38,575 --> 00:50:41,008
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see a sign-in desk you wanna avoid. Where do you go?

748
00:50:43,546 --> 00:50:45,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Restroom. - Yep.

749
00:50:57,761 --> 00:50:58,988
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got it.

750
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:14,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could those be used to rig an elevator?

751
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:20,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have no idea, but he doesn't sign in and then he hides these?

752
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell is that?

753
00:52:04,431 --> 00:52:05,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish he'd stop.

754
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even know your name.

755
00:52:22,449 --> 00:52:23,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Ben.

756
00:52:24,752 --> 00:52:26,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Sarah.

757
00:52:29,157 --> 00:52:30,953
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Tony.

758
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,764
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So where'd your claustrophobia go?

759
00:52:46,841 --> 00:52:47,898
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me?

760
00:52:50,479 --> 00:52:54,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never seen claustrophobia come and go like that.

761
00:52:56,485 --> 00:52:58,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You trying to say something? Then say it. - Yeah, yeah.

762
00:52:58,587 --> 00:52:59,985
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I'm saying I didn't do this,

763
00:53:00,055 --> 00:53:01,885
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I very much doubt that she did, so that leaves you.

764
00:53:02,758 --> 00:53:05,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm saying I think this claustrophobia thing...

765
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:08,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's an act.

766
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:10,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm saying I think you're a liar.

767
00:53:23,413 --> 00:53:24,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill him, Ben!

768
00:53:27,183 --> 00:53:28,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill him before he kills us!

769
00:53:30,053 --> 00:53:31,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill him!

770
00:53:34,891 --> 00:53:35,879
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it! Stop!

771
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it! Get us out! Get us out! Get us out!

772
00:53:41,931 --> 00:53:45,297
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back away from each other now! Get off!

773
00:53:46,403 --> 00:53:48,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna keep you safe and here's how,

774
00:53:48,371 --> 00:53:51,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}everyone get to a corner and place your hands on the wall

775
00:53:51,175 --> 00:53:52,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so everyone can see that you're not up to anything.

776
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:55,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead. Do it!

777
00:53:58,682 --> 00:54:00,205
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You won't have to keep this up long.

778
00:54:00,285 --> 00:54:02,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The building is surrounded by police.

779
00:54:10,095 --> 00:54:13,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In a hypothetical conversation that I'm not really having,

780
00:54:14,966 --> 00:54:17,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how would this story of yours end?

781
00:54:18,603 --> 00:54:20,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They all die.

782
00:54:22,408 --> 00:54:23,738
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it?

783
00:54:25,243 --> 00:54:26,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

784
00:54:28,114 --> 00:54:29,944
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not your fault.

785
00:54:31,617 --> 00:54:34,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They made the choices that brought them here.

786
00:54:36,354 --> 00:54:38,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. You're gonna love this.

787
00:54:38,391 --> 00:54:39,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have you got?

788
00:54:39,759 --> 00:54:41,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She has a criminal record, too.

789
00:54:41,694 --> 00:54:44,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three counts of blackmailing rich married men.

790
00:54:44,297 --> 00:54:45,558
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now where this gets interesting,

791
00:54:45,631 --> 00:54:48,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is couple of years ago, the arrests stopped. Guess why.

792
00:54:48,135 --> 00:54:49,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me.

793
00:54:49,236 --> 00:54:50,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, her name is Sarah Caraway.

794
00:54:51,404 --> 00:54:52,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Caraway" Caraway?

795
00:54:52,705 --> 00:54:53,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. She married into the family.

796
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So she shoplifted an heir.

797
00:54:55,275 --> 00:54:56,366
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, something like that, I guess.

798
00:54:56,443 --> 00:54:58,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's she doing here?

799
00:54:58,145 --> 00:54:59,406
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}According to the sign-in sheet,

800
00:54:59,479 --> 00:55:02,914
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she was gonna see a lawyer on 42 named Wayne Kazan.

801
00:55:04,284 --> 00:55:06,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. Excuse me.

802
00:55:07,454 --> 00:55:10,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, listen up! Quiet down! Quiet down!

803
00:55:11,958 --> 00:55:13,288
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, quiet!

804
00:55:14,329 --> 00:55:15,818
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Philadelphia P. D!

805
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:18,455
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm looking for a Wayne Kazan.

806
00:55:18,532 --> 00:55:20,055
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there a Wayne Kazan down here?

807
00:55:20,134 --> 00:55:21,794
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

808
00:55:21,869 --> 00:55:23,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me.

809
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:26,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heads up. Did you have a meeting today with a Sarah Caraway?

810
00:55:27,608 --> 00:55:28,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Do you have a subpoena?

811
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:30,604
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, you can tell me that much.

812
00:55:30,879 --> 00:55:32,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I might have. Why?

813
00:55:32,613 --> 00:55:35,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was attacked. Who has motive to hurt her?

814
00:55:35,718 --> 00:55:37,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you know I can't divulge personal information.

815
00:55:37,386 --> 00:55:38,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, man. Give me something.

816
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:39,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me something to work with here.

817
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:41,084
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm trying to save your client's life.

818
00:55:42,091 --> 00:55:43,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come here.

819
00:55:46,462 --> 00:55:48,326
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I'd do what you guys normally do

820
00:55:48,397 --> 00:55:50,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and start with the person closest to her.

821
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,264
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thanks. - And just so you know,

822
00:55:53,936 --> 00:55:56,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my specialty is forensic accounting.

823
00:55:58,474 --> 00:56:00,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Markowitz, get Mrs. Caraway's husband on the phone.

824
00:56:07,249 --> 00:56:08,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Should be okay now.

825
00:56:17,093 --> 00:56:18,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, get in there.

826
00:56:37,715 --> 00:56:40,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I might have found the problem. It's a bad wire.

827
00:56:40,651 --> 00:56:43,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like it could be shorting out the circuits.

828
00:57:03,308 --> 00:57:04,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

829
00:57:08,046 --> 00:57:10,445
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy. Easy.

830
00:57:10,782 --> 00:57:11,975
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it.

831
00:57:31,704 --> 00:57:33,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm fine.

832
00:57:33,373 --> 00:57:35,738
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vasquez, we're gonna need the large Target saw up here

833
00:57:35,808 --> 00:57:36,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as fast as you can bring it.

834
00:57:44,585 --> 00:57:46,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, we need two more on 21, okay, guys?

835
00:57:46,086 --> 00:57:47,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any luck getting hold of the husband?

836
00:57:48,021 --> 00:57:49,009
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, not yet.

837
00:57:49,089 --> 00:57:51,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I called his office and his secretary said he'd call me right back.

838
00:57:56,029 --> 00:57:57,791
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back up! Heads up, heads up! Come on!

839
00:57:57,865 --> 00:57:59,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heads up! Back up!

840
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:01,464
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move out of the way! Get away! Back up!

841
00:58:01,536 --> 00:58:03,298
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened? Anybody see what happened?

842
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:04,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Medic!

843
00:58:04,438 --> 00:58:05,426
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He came through the door.

844
00:58:05,707 --> 00:58:07,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Breathe. Breathe.

845
00:58:08,209 --> 00:58:09,505
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lustig.

846
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:12,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back away! Back away! Move back!

847
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get everybody back. Back away!

848
00:58:33,669 --> 00:58:35,101
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put your hands back on the wall.

849
00:58:35,237 --> 00:58:36,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It hurts.

850
00:58:40,743 --> 00:58:43,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put your hands back up on that wall.

851
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:47,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or what?

852
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:53,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just leave her alone. She's in pain.

853
00:58:53,857 --> 00:58:56,086
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you see what she's doing?

854
00:58:57,226 --> 00:58:58,886
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chick's a twist.

855
00:58:59,462 --> 00:59:00,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you talking about?

856
00:59:00,764 --> 00:59:03,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's what we used to call people like her in the Marines.

857
00:59:04,668 --> 00:59:07,795
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Suddenly out of the blue, everybody would start fighting with each other.

858
00:59:07,904 --> 00:59:10,303
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tempers would flare, people would start getting hurt.

859
00:59:10,374 --> 00:59:14,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But then we realized it's just the new guy

860
00:59:15,279 --> 00:59:17,371
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}telling everybody what other people said,

861
00:59:17,447 --> 00:59:19,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}stirring shit up where there wasn't any.

862
00:59:21,819 --> 00:59:25,845
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Until one night when we beat the living shit out of that twist.

863
00:59:27,858 --> 00:59:30,655
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then, just like that,

864
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:34,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}everything would go back to normal.

865
00:59:37,169 --> 00:59:38,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you threatening me?

866
00:59:39,403 --> 00:59:41,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want you to know that I know.

867
00:59:43,775 --> 00:59:46,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you just shut up and keep your hands on the wall?

868
01:00:03,563 --> 01:00:05,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sarah Caraway's husband won't talk to us.

869
01:00:05,597 --> 01:00:06,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He lawyered up.

870
01:00:06,698 --> 01:00:09,325
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her lawyer told me she's locating all his money.

871
01:00:09,669 --> 01:00:11,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I bet she's about to leave him and he might know it.

872
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:13,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That would definitely give him motive to kill her.

873
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,465
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if he's trying to kill his wife,

874
01:00:15,541 --> 01:00:17,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}why are Jane Kowski and Vince McCormick dead?

875
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:18,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Matt with Caraway Security.

876
01:00:18,946 --> 01:00:20,207
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need someone from maintenance

877
01:00:20,279 --> 01:00:21,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to come down and shut the bay doors.

878
01:00:24,118 --> 01:00:27,746
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sarah Caraway's husband doesn't own Caraway Security, does he?

879
01:00:28,821 --> 01:00:30,185
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meet me in the office!

880
01:00:40,834 --> 01:00:42,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not done yet.

881
01:00:42,202 --> 01:00:43,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the Kensington sniper all over again.

882
01:00:44,104 --> 01:00:45,502
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's a Kensington sniper?

883
01:00:46,241 --> 01:00:48,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A few years ago, a guy shot four strangers and then his own wife,

884
01:00:48,876 --> 01:00:50,809
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}trying to make a personal killing look like a serial.

885
01:00:50,879 --> 01:00:53,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The guard works for the woman's husband.

886
01:00:53,181 --> 01:00:54,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think the two victims were just a decoy.

887
01:00:54,848 --> 01:00:55,939
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The guard is gonna kill her.

888
01:00:56,084 --> 01:00:57,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to be in that elevator right now!

889
01:00:57,285 --> 01:00:58,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Move! - Right.

890
01:01:02,123 --> 01:01:03,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please don't let him kill me, Ben.

891
01:01:03,725 --> 01:01:05,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't.

892
01:01:05,694 --> 01:01:08,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come over here next to me and I'll keep you safe.

893
01:01:10,398 --> 01:01:12,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry. Come on.

894
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold up your cell phones.

895
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:21,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Use the screens as flashlights.

896
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:24,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't let it go dark in there.

897
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:26,175
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep the light on each other.

898
01:01:26,248 --> 01:01:27,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep shining it all around the elevator.

899
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:41,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you do it. Don't you do it.

900
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:03,686
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It just doesn't make any sense.

901
01:02:05,757 --> 01:02:07,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God. It is you.

902
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:11,616
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, lady.

903
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:15,323
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They can't hear you. You don't have to pretend anymore.

904
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:17,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We both know who did this.

905
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:20,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we do.

906
01:02:31,816 --> 01:02:34,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put down the glass and get your hands on the wall now!

907
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:37,413
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should kill you right now.

908
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:39,513
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should kill you right now before you try anything else.

909
01:02:39,591 --> 01:02:40,887
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should cut you right now.

910
01:02:40,959 --> 01:02:43,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what'll be your defense? Huh?

911
01:02:44,696 --> 01:02:46,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"She killed them all, so I had to kill her"?

912
01:02:47,065 --> 01:02:49,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, something like that.

913
01:02:49,435 --> 01:02:51,334
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You take me down,

914
01:02:52,271 --> 01:02:56,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they're pinning all of this on you and you know it.

915
01:02:57,509 --> 01:02:59,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A big, tough guy like yourself.

916
01:03:02,515 --> 01:03:03,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is what he does.

917
01:03:04,284 --> 01:03:06,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wants us to doubt everything.

918
01:03:06,452 --> 01:03:07,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Markowitz.

919
01:03:08,254 --> 01:03:10,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Markowitz? - We're getting close, boss.

920

01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:26,069
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no easy answer.

925
01:03:27,441 --> 01:03:29,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're never gonna get these people

01:03:32,346 --> 01:03:34,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'cause it's the lies that we tell ourselves,

928

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they introduce us to him.

930
01:03:50,999 --> 01:03:52,295
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't think just because I'm a cop

931
01:03:52,367 --> 01:03:54,493
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what you're going through right now.

932
01:03:57,773 --> 01:03:59,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been to hell.

933
01:04:02,912 --> 01:04:05,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Six months ago, I...

934
01:04:08,284 --> 01:04:11,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...checked into a hotel and I nearly drank myself to death.

935
01:04:12,821 --> 01:04:16,256
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The thing is, when you're self-destructing,

936
01:04:16,325 --> 01:04:18,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it looks like it's the world's fault.

937
01:04:18,427 --> 01:04:21,884
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like you're dealt a series of shit hands, but that's not real.

938
01:04:22,298 --> 01:04:25,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay? It was all on me. All of it.

01:04:26,769 --> 01:04:29,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I realized my only way out of hell was to take responsibility

940
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,463
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for what I had become.

941

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are responsible for this.

942
01:04:36,713 --> 01:04:37,974
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You realize that, don't you?

943
01:04:38,048 --> 01:04:40,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take responsibility for what you're doing.

944

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put down the glass.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay?

948
01:05:02,807 --> 01:05:04,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll call a truce.

949
01:05:29,301 --> 01:05:30,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

01:06:44,212 --> 01:06:46,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he didn't want to bring his tools in with him.

962
