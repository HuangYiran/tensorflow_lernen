{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She isn't coming yet, Toto.

00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did she hurt you?

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She tried to, didn't she?

5
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on. We'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Aunt Em!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Aunt Em!

8
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto...

9
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dorothy, please! We're counting!

10
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- But she hit him... -Don't bother us now, honey.

11
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The incubator's gone bad and we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks.

12
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That poor little thing.

13
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But Miss Gulch hit Toto with a rake...

14
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...because she says he chases her nasty old cat every day!

15
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...seventy. Dorothy, please!

16
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But he doesn't do it every day! Just once or twice a week.

17
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And he can't catch her old cat anyway. Now she says she'll...

18
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dorothy! We're busy.

19
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, all right.

20
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- How's she coming? -Take it easy.

21
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You got my finger!

22
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why don't you get your finger out of the way?

23
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- There you are. -Right on my finger!

24
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Lucky it wasn't your head!

25
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Zeke, what am I going to do about Miss Gulch? Just because Toto...

26
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Listen, honey, I got them hogs to get in.

27
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You ain't using your head. You'd think you didn't have any brains.

28
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I have so got brains!

29
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why don't you use them?

30
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't go by Miss Gulch's place.

31
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.

32
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.

33
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.

34
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Get in there before I make a dime bank out of you!

35
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Listen, kid...

36
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...are you gonna let that old Gulch heifer try and buffalo you?

37
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She ain't nothing to be afraid of. Have a little courage.

38
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not afraid of her.

39
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Next time she squawks, walk up to her and spit in her eye.

40
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's what I'ddo.

41
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Help me, Zeke! Get me out of here!

42
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Help!

43
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Are you all right, Dorothy? -Yes, I'm all right.

44
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I fell in and Zeke...

45
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why, Zeke, you're just as scared as I am!

46
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You gonna let a little pig make a coward out of you?

47
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look at you...

48
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?

49
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know three farm hands that'll be out of a job!

50
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dorothy was...

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory.

52
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You and Hunk get back to that wagon. -All right.

53
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But someday they'll erect a statue to me...

54
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, don't start posing for it now.

55
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.

56
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Gosh, Mrs. Gale. -Just fried.

57
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You see, Dorothy toppled into the...

58
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's no place for Dorothy around a pigsty!

59
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Feed those hogs before they worry themselves into anemia!

60
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you know what Miss Gulch said she was going to do to Toto?

61
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- She said she'd... -Stop imagining things.

62
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're always in a fret over nothing. You just help us out today...

63
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and find a place where you won't get into any trouble.

64
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Someplace where there isn't any trouble.

65
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto?

66
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There must be.

67
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train.

68
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's far, far away.

69
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Behind the moon...

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's a land that I heard of

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Once in a lullaby

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Skies are blue

77

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And the dreams that you dare to dream

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Really do come true

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mr. Gale.

95
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Howdy, Miss Gulch.

96
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I want to see you and your wife about Dorothy.

97
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What has Dorothy done? -What's she done?

98
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!

99
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- You mean, she bit you? -No, her dog!

100
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She bit her dog, eh?

101
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No.

102
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That dog's a menace. I'm taking him to make sure he's destroyed.

103
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Destroyed! Toto?

104
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, you can't! You mustn't!

105
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! You won't let her, will you?

106
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Of course we won't.

107
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Will we, Em?

108
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please, Aunt Em!

109
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Toto didn't know he was doing anything wrong.

110
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:02,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm the one that ought to be punished. Send me to bed without supper.

111
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hand over that dog or I'll bring a suit that'll take your farm!

112
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The law protects folks against dogs that bite!

113
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How about if she ties him up? He's gentle.

114
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- With gentle people, that is. -That's for the sheriff to decide.

115
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This order allows me to take him. Unless you want to go against the law.

116
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We can't go against the law. I'm afraid Toto has to go.

117
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now you're seeing reason.

118
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here's what I'm taking him in, so he can't attack me again.

119
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I won't let you take him!

120
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You go away!

121
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll bite you myself!

122
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let her take Toto!

123
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've got an order! Let me have him!

124
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Put him in the basket, Henry.

125
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- The idea! -Don't, Uncle Henry.

126
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, Toto!

127
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Almira Gulch, just because you own haIf the county...

128
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...doesn't mean you can run the rest of us!

129
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}For 23 years I've been dying to tell you what I thought of you!

130
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And now...

131
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, being a Christian woman, I can't say it!

132
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Toto, darling!

133
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I got you back!

134
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You came back!

135
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm so glad!

136
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They'll be coming back for you in a minute.

137
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We've got to get away!

138
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We've got to run away!

139
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, well, well! Houseguests, eh?

140
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And who might you be?

141
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, no. Now, don't tell me.

142
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's see.

143
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're traveling in disguise.

144
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, that's not right.

145
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're going on a visit.

146
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, I'm wrong.

147
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're running away.

148
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How did you guess?

149
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Professor Marvel never guesses. He knows!

150
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now, why are you running away?

151
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, no. Now, don't tell me.

152
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They don't understand you at home. They don't appreciate you.

153
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You want to see other lands. Big cities, big mountains, big oceans.

154
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.

155
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Toto, that's not polite! We haven't been asked yet.

156
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's perfectly welcome.

157
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}As one dog to another, huh?

158
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here now, where were we...?

159
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why can't we go with you and see the crowned heads of Europe?

160
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you know any? Oh, you mean the thing....

161
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I never do anything without consulting my crystal first.

162
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's go inside here. We'll...

163
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just come along. I'll show you.

164
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's right. Here.

165
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sit right down here.

166
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's it.

167
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:56,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is the same genuine, magic, authentic crystal...

168
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...used by the priests of lsis and Osiris in the days of the Pharaohs...

169
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:06,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...in which Cleopatra saw the approach of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony.

170
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And so on, and so on.

171
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now, you'd better close your eyes, my child, for a moment...

172
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...in order to be better in tune with the lnfinite.

173
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We can't do these things without reaching out into the lnfinite.

174
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, that's all right.

175
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now you can open them. We'll gaze into the crystal.

176
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's this I see? A house with a picket fence...

177
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and a barn with a weathervane...

178
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...of a running horse.

179
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's our farm!

180
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's a woman.

181
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:51,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She's wearing a polka-dot dress. Her face is careworn.

182
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's Aunt Em.

183
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, her name is Emily.

184
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's right. What's she doing?

185

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why, she's crying.

187
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Someone has hurt her.

188
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Someone has just about broken her heart.

189
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Me?

190
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, it's someone she loves very much.

191
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Someone she's been very kind to.

192
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Someone she's taken care of in sickness.

193
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I had the measles once, and she stayed right by me every minute.

194
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's she doing now?

195
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,890

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why, she's putting her hand on her heart!

198
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She's dropping down on the bed!

199
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, that's all. The crystal's gone dark.

200
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You don't suppose she could really be sick, do you?

201
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,700

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A whopper, to speak in the vernacular of the peasantry.

207
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Poor little kid. I hope she gets home all right.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We can't look for her now.

216
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,080

223
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

224
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We must be over the rainbow!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now I know we're not in Kansas.

226
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:45,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you a good witch or a bad witch?

227
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who, me?

228
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm not a witch at all.

229
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm Dorothy Gale, from Kansas.

230
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is that the witch?

231
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who, Toto? Toto's my dog.

232
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins called me because a new witch...

233
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.

234
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And there's the house, and here you are...

235
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and that's all that's left of the Wicked Witch of the East.

236
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What the Munchkins want to know is, are you a good witch or a bad witch?

237
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I've already told you, I'm not a witch at all.

238
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Witches are old and ugly.

239
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What was that?

240
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The Munchkins. They're laughing because I am a witch.

241
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.

242
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You are?

243
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I beg your pardon!

244
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I've never heard of a beautiful witch.

245
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Only bad witches are ugly.

246
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The Munchkins are happy...

247
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...because you freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.

248
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But if you please, what are Munchkins?

249
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The little people who live here. It's Munchkinland...

250
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and you are their national heroine.

251
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:58,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's all right. You may all come out and thank her.

252
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,410

255
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And Kansas, she says Is the name of the star

256
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,100

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}When she fell out of Kansas

260
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:41,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A miracle occurred

261

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It really was no miracle What happened was just this

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But how do I start for Emerald City?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't be silly, Toto. Scarecrows don't talk.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's pleasant down that way too.

00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's funny. Wasn't he pointing the other way?

403
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Of course, people do go both ways.

404
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:38,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why, you did say something, didn't you?

405
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:46,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you doing that on purpose, or can't you make up your mind?

406
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's the trouble. I can't make up my mind.

407
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I haven't got a brain.

408
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Only straw.

409
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How can you talk if you haven't got a brain?

410
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know.

411
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:01,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But some people without brains do a lot of talking, don't they?

412
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, I guess you're right.

00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:09,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, we haven't really met properly, have we?

414
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why, no.

415
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How do you do?

416
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How do you do?

417
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Very well, thank you. -I'm not feeling at all well.

418
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:22,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's very tedious being stuck up here all day long with a pole up your back.

419
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:26,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, dear. That must be terribly uncomfortable. Can't you get down?

420
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Down? No, you see, l'm... Well, l'm...

421
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, here. Let me help you.

422
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's very kind of you. Very kind.

423
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, dear. I don't see....

424
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Of course, I'm not bright about doing things...

425
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...but if you'll just bend the nail down, maybe I'll slip off and...

426
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, yes!

427
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There goes some of me again!

428
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Does it hurt you?

429
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.

430
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My! It's good to be free!

431
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did I scare you?

432
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I just thought you hurt yourself.

433
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I didn't scare you?

434
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, of course not.

435
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I didn't think so.

436
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Boo! Scat! Boo!

437
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:21,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You see? I can't even scare a crow.

438
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They come from miles around just to eat in my field and laugh in my face.

439
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, I'm a failure, because I haven't got a brain!

440
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What would you do with a brain if you had one?

441
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do? Why, if I had a brain, I could...

442
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:40,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I could while away the hours Conferring with the flowers

443
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Consulting with the rain

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And my head I'd be scratchin' While my thoughts were busy hatchin'

445
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If I Only Had a Brain

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'd unravel every riddle For any individ'le

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}In trouble or in pain

448
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}With the thoughts you'd be thinkin' You could be another Lincoln

449
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If you only had a brain

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, I could tell you why

451
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The ocean's near the shore

452
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I could think of things I never thunk before

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And then I'd sit And think some more

454
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I would not be just a nothin' My head all full of stuffin'

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And really feel the part

557

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I could stay young and chipper And I'd lock it with a zipper

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If I Only Had a Heart

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...to ask the Wizard for a heart.

565
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:49,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Suppose the Wizard wouldn't give me one when we got there.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We've come such a long way already.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let her try and make a beehive out of me!

584
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're the best friends anybody ever had.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.

586
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:12,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- But I couldn't have, could l? -I don't see how.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together.

588
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:19,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.

589
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Still, I wish I could remember.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I guess it doesn't matter anyway.

591
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:27,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We know each other now.

598
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Because of the wonderful things he does

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't like this forest.

601
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:23,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's dark and creepy!

602
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Of course, I don't know...

603
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.

604
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:34,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?

605
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:35,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We might.

606
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}AnimaIs that eat straw?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Some, but mostly lions and tigers and bears.

608
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Lions! -And tigers?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll fight you both together, if you want.

618
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll fight you with one paw tied behind my back!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Pulling an ax on me, eh?

622
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sneaking up on me, eh? Why....

623
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:55,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Go away and let us alone. -Oh, scared, huh?

624
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Afraid, huh?

625
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:00,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How long can you stay fresh in that can?

626
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on, get up and fight, you shivering junkyard.

627
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Put your hands up, you lopsided bag of hay!

628
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's getting personal, Lion.

629
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, get up and teach him a lesson.

630
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's wrong with you teaching him?

631
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, I hardly know him.

632
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll get you anyway, peewee!

633
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Shame on you!

634
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:38,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What did you do that for? I didn't bite him.

635
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, but you tried to.

636
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but picking on little dogs....

637
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?

638
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is my nose bleeding?

639
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, of course not.

640
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My goodness, what a fuss you're making!

641
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:01,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are....

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and I never appreciated it.

920
01:07:57,370 --> 01:08:00,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Running away and hurting her feelings.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I was just thinking, I don't want to see the Wizard this much.

931
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:58,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I better wait for you outside.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'dbe too scared to ask him for it.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...by performing a very small task.

1012
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Go away now!

1013
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:34,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Toto! Toto! Help!

1014
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:52,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Help! Help! Help!

1015
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:54,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What happened to you?

1016
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:57,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They tore my legs off and threw them over there!

1017
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then they took my chest and threw it over there!

1018
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:01,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's you all over.

1019
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They sure knocked the stuffings out of you.

1020
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:07,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't stand there. Put me together. We've got to find Dorothy!

1021
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:09,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now, let's see....

1022
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What a nice little dog.

1023
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And you, my dear.

1024
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:22,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What an unexpected pleasure.

1025
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:26,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's so kind of you to visit me in my loneliness.

1026
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:31,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What are you gonna do with my dog? Give him back!

1027
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:33,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All in good time, my little pretty.

1028
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All in good time.

1029
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:37,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please give me back my dog.

1030
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:40,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Certainly, certainly...

1031
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...when you give me those slippers.

1032
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:45,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But the Good Witch told me not to.

1033
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:47,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Very well.

1034
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:49,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Throw that basket in the river.

1035
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:54,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No! You can have your old slippers, but give me back Toto!

1036
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's a good little girl.

1037
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:58,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I knew you'd see reason!

1038
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:05,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm sorry! I didn't do it. Can I still have my dog?

1039
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:09,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No! Fool that I am, I should have remembered...

1040
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...those slippers will never come off...

1041
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:16,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...as long as you're alive.

1042
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:20,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But that's not what's worrying me. It's how to do it.

1043
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}These things must be done delicately...

1044
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:25,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...or you hurt the spell.

1045
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:29,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Run, Toto, run! -Catch him, you fool!

1046
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Run, Toto, run!

1047
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He got away! He got away!

1048
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:50,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Which is more than you will!

1049
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:52,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Drat, you and your dog!

1050
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:54,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You've been more trouble to me than you're worth.

1051
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:57,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But it'll soon be over now!

1052
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:00,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you see that?

1053
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:03,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's how much longer you've got to be alive.

1054
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:06,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And it isn't long, my pretty. It isn't long!

1055
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:09,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can't wait forever to get those shoes!

1056
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:33,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm frightened.

1057
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:37,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm frightened, Auntie Em! I'm frightened.

1058
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:44,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where are you?

1059
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's me. It's Auntie Em.

1060
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:50,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're trying to find you. Where are you?

1061
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em.

1062
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:55,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm locked up in the Witch's castle...

1063
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:58,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and I'm trying to get home to you, Auntie Em!

1064
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:00,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away!

1065
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:02,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm frightened!

1066
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come back! Come back!

1067
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:07,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Auntie Em, Auntie Em! Come back!"

1068
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:11,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!

1069
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:38,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look! There's Toto!

1070
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where'd he come from?

1071
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why, don't you see?

1072
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's come to take us to Dorothy.

1073
01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:49,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on, fellas!

1074
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I hope my strength holds out.

1075
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:12,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I hope your tail holds out.

1076
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:26,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's that?

1077
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's the castle of the Wicked Witch!

1078
01:20:29,410 --> 01:20:33,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Dorothy's in that awful place? -I hate to think of her in there.

1079
01:20:33,290 --> 01:20:36,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- We've got to get her out. -Don't cry now.

1080
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:39,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We haven't got the oilcan, and you've been squeaking enough as it is.

1081
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who's them? Who's them?

1082
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:59,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I've got a plan how to get in there. -Fine. He's got a plan.

1083
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:02,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- And you're gonna lead us. -Yeah.

1084
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:05,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Me? -Yes, you.

1085
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:09,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I gotta get her out of there? -That's right.

1086
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy.

1087
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch...

1088
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:18,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...guards or no guards, I'll tear them apart.

1089
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:23,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.

1090
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:27,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- There's only one thing I want you to do. -What's that?

1091
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:29,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Talk me out of it.

1092
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:32,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- No, you don't! -Oh, no.

1093
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Now, wait a minute. -Up!

1094
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:36,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on, I've got another idea.

1095
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:40,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you think it would be polite, dropping in like this?

1096
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where do we go now?

1097
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There!

1098
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait! We better make sure. Dorothy, are you in there?

1099
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:33,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's us!

1100
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:35,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes!

1101
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:38,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's me! She's locked me in!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I wouldn't hear of it.

1110
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:29,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why, my little party's just beginning.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We'll let them think about it a little first.

1114
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Seize them! Seize them!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ring-around the rosie, a pocket full of spears!

1125
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:05,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thought you'd be pretty foxy, didn't you?

1126
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:09,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The last to go will see the first three go before her.

1127
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:13,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And her mangy little dog too!

1128

1135
01:26:44,370 --> 01:26:46,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...could destroy my beautiful wickedness?

1136

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm going.

1138
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:09,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She's dead. You've killed her.

1139
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:11,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I didn't mean to kill her.

1140
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Really, I didn't.

1141
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's just that he was on fire.

1142
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!

1149
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The Wicked Witch is dead!

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can I believe my eyes?

1151
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:39,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why have you come back?

1152
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:44,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please, sir. We've done what you told us.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We melted her.

1155
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:54,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You liquidated her, eh? Very resourceful.

1156
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:55,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, sir.

1157
01:27:56,110 --> 01:27:59,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please.

1158
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:03,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Not so fast. Not so fast!

1159
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll have to give the matter a little thought.

1160
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:08,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Go away and come back tomorrow.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I want to go home now!

1163
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:16,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You've had plenty of time already.

1164
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:20,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do not arouse the wrath of the Great and Powerful Oz!

1165
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:23,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I said come back tomorrow!

1166
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:27,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises.

1167
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:30,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you presume to criticize the Great Oz?

1168
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:33,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You ungrateful creatures!

1169
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:37,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Think yourselves lucky that I'm giving you audience tomorrow...

1170
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:40,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...instead of 20 years from now!

1171
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:45,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The Great Oz has spoken!

1172
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:50,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.

1173
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:54,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The Great and... Oz has spoken.

1174
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:55,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who are you?

1175
01:28:55,580 --> 01:29:00,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, I am the Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz.

1176
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:02,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You are?

1177
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:03,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't believe you!

1178
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:07,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.

1179
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:09,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You humbug!

1180
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:13,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, that's exactly so. I'm a humbug.

1181
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're a very bad man!

1182
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:20,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, my dear. I'm a very good man.

1183
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:23,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm just a very bad wizard.

1184
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:25,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What about the heart you promised Tin Man?

1185
01:29:25,990 --> 01:29:27,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And the courage you promised Cowardly Lion?

1186
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:30,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And Scarecrow's brain?

1187
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:34,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why, anybody can have a brain. That's a very mediocre commodity.

1188
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:37,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Every pusillanimous creature that crawIs on the earth...

1189
01:29:37,460 --> 01:29:40,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...or slinks through slimy seas has a brain.

1190
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Back where I come from, we have universities...

1191
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:46,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...seats of great learning, where men go to become great thinkers.

1192
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:51,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They think deep thoughts, and with no more brains than you have.

1193
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:55,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But they have one thing you haven't got. A diploma.

1194
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:59,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me...

1195
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:03,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...by the Universitatus Committeeatum E Pluribus Unum...

1196
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:05,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...I hereby confer upon you...

1197
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:09,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...the honorary degree of Th. D.

1198
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:10,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Th. D. ?

1199
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:13,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's Doctor of Thinkology.

1200
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:16,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The sum of the square roots of two sides of an isosceles triangle...

1201
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:19,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...is equal to the square root of the remaining side.

1202
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:22,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, joy! Rapture!

1203
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've got a brain!

1204
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:26,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How can I thank you enough?

1205
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:28,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, you can't. As for you, my fine friend...

1206
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:31,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...you're a victim of disorganized thinking.

1207
01:30:31,390 --> 01:30:35,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You are under the delusion that because you run away from danger...

1208
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:39,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...you have no courage. You're confusing courage with wisdom.

1209
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:43,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Back where I come from, we have men who are called "heroes. "

1210
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:46,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs...

1211
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:49,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and parade it down the main street.

1212
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:52,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And they have no more courage than you have.

1213
01:30:52,450 --> 01:30:56,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But they have one thing that you haven't got. A medal.

1214
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Therefore...

1215
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:02,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...for meritorious conduct, extraordinary valor...

1216
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:05,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...conspicuous bravery against wicked witches...

1217
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:08,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...I award you the Triple Cross.

1218
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:11,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You are now a member of the Legion of Courage.

1219
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:17,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Shucks, folks, I'm speechless.

1220
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:23,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart.

1221
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:25,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You don't know how lucky you are not to have one.

1222
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:30,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable.

1223
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I still want one.

1224
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:37,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Back where I come from, there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds.

1225
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:40,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They are called phil...

1226
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:45,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good-deed-doers. And their hearts are no bigger than yours.

1227
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:49,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But they have one thing you haven't got. A testimonial.

1228
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:52,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Therefore, in consideration of your kindness...

1229
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:55,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...I take pleasure at this time in presenting you...

1230
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:58,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...with a small token of our esteem and affection.

1231
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:01,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And remember, my sentimental friend...

1232
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:05,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...that a heart is not judged by how much you love...

1233
01:32:05,570 --> 01:32:08,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...but by how much you are loved by others.

1234
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:13,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It ticks!

1235
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:16,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Listen! Look, it ticks!

1236
01:32:16,950 --> 01:32:19,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Read what my medal says. "Courage. "

1237
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:22,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ain't it the truth! Ain't it the truth!

1238
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, they're all wonderful.

1239
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, what about Dorothy?

1240
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:28,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, how about Dorothy?

1241
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:30,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dorothy next.

1242
01:32:30,590 --> 01:32:34,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't think there's anything in that black bag for me.

1243
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:36,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You force me into a cataclysmic decision.

1244
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:40,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The only way to get Dorothy to Kansas is for me to take her myself.

1245
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:44,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, will you? Could you?

1246
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:48,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But are you clever enough to manage it?

1247
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:50,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Child, you cut me to the quick!

1248
01:32:50,780 --> 01:32:52,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm an old Kansas man myself...

1249
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:55,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...born and bred in the western wilderness...

1250
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:59,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...premier balloonist par excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company.

1251
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Until one day, while performing feats of stratospheric skill...

1252
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...never before attempted by civilized man...

1253
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...an unfortunate phenomena occurred.

1254
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The balloon failed to return to the fair.

1255
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:13,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It did?

1256
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:14,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Weren't you frightened?

1257
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:18,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death...

1258
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:22,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe. I was petrified.

1259
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:24,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Suddenly the wind changed...

1260
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:28,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and the balloon floated down into this noble city...

1261
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:33,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the first wizard deluxe!

1262
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:36,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Times being what they were, I accepted the job...

1263
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:41,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick getaway.

1264
01:33:41,290 --> 01:33:43,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And in that balloon, dear Dorothy...

1265
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:48,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum.

1266
01:33:53,970 --> 01:33:57,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My friends. I mean, my friends!

1267
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:07,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is positively the finest exhibition ever to be shown...

1268
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:09,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...be that as it may.

1269
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:13,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}l, your Wizard per ardua ad alta...

1270
01:34:13,150 --> 01:34:15,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...am about to embark upon a hazardous...

1271
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:18,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and technically unexplainable journey...

1272
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:21,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...into the outer stratosphere!

1273
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:26,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}To confer, converse...

1274
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:30,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and otherwise hobnob with my brother wizards.

1275
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:34,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I hereby decree that until what time...

1276
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...if any, that I return...

1277
01:34:36,970 --> 01:34:41,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...the Scarecrow, by virtue of his highly superior brains...

1278
01:34:41,850 --> 01:34:43,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...shall rule in my stead...

1279
01:34:43,850 --> 01:34:48,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...assisted by the Tin Man, by virtue of his magnificent heart...

1280
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:52,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and the Lion, by virtue of his courage.

1281
01:34:52,690 --> 01:34:55,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Obey them as you would me.

1282
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:56,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thank you.

1283
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:01,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come back!

1284
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't go without me. I'll be right back.

1285
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:05,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stop that dog!

1286
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:10,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is a highly irregular procedure. This is absolutely unprecedented!

1287
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:12,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ruined my exit!

1288
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:14,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come back! Come back!

1289
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't go without me! Please come back!

1290
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:20,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can't come back! I don't know how it works!

1291
01:35:20,430 --> 01:35:21,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Goodbye, folks!

1292
01:35:21,970 --> 01:35:23,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Goodbye!

1293
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:30,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now I'll never get home.

1294
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:33,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stay with us then, Dorothy.

1295
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:35,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We all love you.

1296
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We don't want you to go.

1297
01:35:38,070 --> 01:35:40,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's very kind of you...

1298
01:35:40,530 --> 01:35:43,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...but this could never be like Kansas.

1299
01:35:43,870 --> 01:35:47,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.

1300
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:51,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?

1301
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:54,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look!

1302
01:35:54,630 --> 01:35:56,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here's someone who can help you!

1303
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Will you help me? Can you help me?

1304
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:34,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You don't need help any longer.

1305
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:37,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.

1306
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:38,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I have?

1307
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:40,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why didn't you tell her before?

1308
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:44,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Because she wouldn't have believed me. She had to learn it for herself.

1309
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What have you learned, Dorothy?

1310
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think that it...

1311
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:56,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...that it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

1312
01:36:56,650 --> 01:37:01,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And it's that if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again...

1313
01:37:01,450 --> 01:37:04,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...I won't look any further than my own back yard...

1314
01:37:04,990 --> 01:37:07,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...because if it isn't there...

1315
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:10,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...I never really lost it to begin with.

1316
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:11,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is that right?

1317
01:37:12,330 --> 01:37:13,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's all it is.

1318
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But that's so easy! I should've thought of it for you.

1319
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:18,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I should've feIt it in my heart.

1320
01:37:19,090 --> 01:37:21,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She had to find it out for herself.

1321
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:24,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now those magic slippers will take you home in two seconds.

1322
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Toto too? -Toto too.

1323
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:29,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Now? -Whenever you wish.

1324
01:37:29,930 --> 01:37:31,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, dear.

1325
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:33,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's too wonderful to be true!

1326
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:39,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's gonna be so hard to say goodbye.

1327
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:42,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I love you all too.

1328
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:46,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Goodbye, Tin Man.

1329
01:37:47,490 --> 01:37:49,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't cry.

1330
01:37:49,370 --> 01:37:52,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You'll rust so dreadfully.

1331
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:56,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here. Here's your oilcan.

1332
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:58,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Goodbye.

1333
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now I know I've got a heart...

1334
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...because it's breaking.

1335
01:38:06,090 --> 01:38:07,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Goodbye, Lion.

1336
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know it isn't right...

1337
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:13,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...but I'm gonna miss the way you used to holler for help...

1338
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:16,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...before you found your courage.

1339
01:38:16,310 --> 01:38:20,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I would never have found it if it hadn't been for you.

1340
01:38:25,070 --> 01:38:27,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think I'll miss you most of all.

1341
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:34,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you ready now?

1342
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:39,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Say goodbye, Toto.

1343
01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:44,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, I'm ready now.

1344
01:38:44,630 --> 01:38:46,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then close your eyes...

1345
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:49,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and tap your heeIs together three times...

1346
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:53,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and think to yourself...

1347
01:38:53,890 --> 01:38:57,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}..."There's no place like home.

1348
01:38:57,190 --> 01:39:00,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's no place like home. "

1349
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:04,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's no place like home.

1350
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:07,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's no place like home.

1351
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:29,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wake up, honey.

1352
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:44,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.

1353
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:46,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!

1354
01:39:47,030 --> 01:39:50,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Yes, darling. -Hello there! Anybody home?

1355
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:54,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I dropped by because I heard the little girl got caught in the big...

1356
01:39:54,450 --> 01:39:56,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She seems all right now.

1357
01:39:56,290 --> 01:39:57,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}She got quite a bump.

1358
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:00,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We kind of thought she was gonna leave us.

1359
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:03,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I did leave you. That's just the trouble.

1360
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:05,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And I tried to get back for days!

1361
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:07,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There, there, lie quiet now.

1362
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:10,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You just had a bad dream.

1363
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Remember me...

1364
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...your old pal, Hunk?

1365
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:16,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And me...

1366
01:40:16,930 --> 01:40:17,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...Hickory?

1367
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:20,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You couldn't forget my face, could you?

1368
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:22,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But it wasn't a dream.

1369
01:40:22,690 --> 01:40:23,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It was a place.

1370
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:26,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And you and you and you...

1371
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:28,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and you were there.

1372
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:31,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But you couldn't have been, could you?

1373
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:34,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We dream lots of silly things when we...

1374
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:38,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, Aunt Em, this was a real, truly live place.
