00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, man, you ain't going

105
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to believe the things I got planned for us!

106
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These best friend greetings get longer every year!

107
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ready to have some serious fun?

108
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, I've got something to show you first.

109
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe they renamed the Piston Cup

110
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}after our very own Doc Hudson.

111
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know Doc said these things were just old cups,

112
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but to have someone else win it just didn't feel right, you know?

113
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,930


114
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doc would've been real proud of you. That's for sure.

115
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, pal. I've been waiting all summer for this.

116
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What you got planned?  - You sure you can handle it?

117
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know who you're talking to? This is Lightning McQueen!

118
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can handle anything.

119
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Er... Mater?

120
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just remember, your brakes ain't going to work on these!

121
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mater?  - Relax.

122
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These train tracks ain't been used in years!

123
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Faster, faster. Come on. Here we go!

124
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Faster!

125
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I don't know. Do you think?

126
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is going to be good!

127
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you see that?

128
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh-oh. This ain't going to be good.

129
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ha-ha! Boy, this was the best day ever!

130
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And my favorite souvenir, this new dent.

131
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Boy, Mater, today was ah...  - Shoot, that was nothing.

132
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait till you see what I got planned for tonight!

133
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater, Mater, whoa! I was thinking of just a quiet dinner.

134
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's exactly what I was thinkin'.

135
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, I meant with Sally, Mater.  - Even better!

136
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You, me and Miss Sally goin' out for supper.

137
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater, I meant it would be just me and Sally.

138
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, just for tonight.

139
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.

140
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ok.

141
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thanks for understanding.  - Yeah, sure.

142
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Y'all go on and have fun now.  - All right, then.

143
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you soon, amigo.

144
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, this is so nice.

145
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't tell you how good it is to be here alone,

146
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just the two of us, finally.

147
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You and me. Ahem!  - Good evening.

148
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name is Mater,

149
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'll be your waiter.

150
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater the waiter. That's funny right there.

151
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater? You work here?

152
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I work here. What'd you think?

153
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I snuck in here when nobody was lookin'

154
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and pretended to be your waiter so I could hang out with you?

155
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah. How ridiculous would that be?

156
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I start you two lovebirds off with a couple of drinks?

157
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes. I'll have my usual.  - You know what? I'll have that, too.

158
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh... Right. Your usual.

159
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thanks, man. - Grazie, Guido.

160
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guido, what's McQueen's usual?

161
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How should I know?

162
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Perfect. Give me two of them.  - Quiet! My program's on.

163
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tonight on the Mel Dorado Show...

164
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His story gripped the world.

165
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oil billionaire Miles Axlerod,

166
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in an attempt to become the

167
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}first car to circumnavigate the globe without GPS,

168
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ironically ran out of gas,

169
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and found himself trapped in the wild.

170
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Feared dead, he emerged 36 days later,

171
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}running on a fuel he distilled himself from the natural elements!

172
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Since then, he's sold his oil fortune,

173
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}converted himself from a gas-guzzler into an electric car

174
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and has devoted his life

175
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to finding a renewable, clean-burning fuel.

176
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now he claims to have done it with his Allinol.

177
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And to show the world what his new super fuel can do

178
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he's created a racing competition like no other,

179
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}inviting the greatest champions

180
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to battle in the first ever World Grand Prix.

181
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome, Sir Miles Axlerod.

182
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Mel. It is good to be here. Listen to me.

183
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big oil. It costs a fortune. Pollution is getting worse.

184
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, it's a fossil fuel. "Fossil," As in dead dinosaurs.

185
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we all know what happened to them.

186
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alternative energy is the future. Trust me, Mel.

187
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After seeing Allinol in action at the World Grand Prix,

188
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}nobody will ever go back to gasoline again.

189
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to the dinosaurs, now?

190
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And on satellite, a World Grand Prix competitor

191
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and one of the fastest cars in the world, Francesco Bernoulli.

192
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is an honor, Signore Dorado, for you.

193
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why not invite Lightning McQueen?  - What?

194
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course we invited him,

195
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but apparently after his very long racing season

196
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he is taking time off to rest.

197
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Lightning McQueen would not have a chance against Francesco.

198
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can go over 300 kilometers an hour.

199
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In miles, that is like... way faster than McQueen.

200
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go to the phones. Baltimore Maryland, you're on the air.

201
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Am I on? Hello?  - You're on. Go ahead.

202
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello?  - Go ahead.

203
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go to Radiator Springs. You're on, caller.

204
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That Italian feller you got on there

205
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}can't talk that way about Lightning McQueen.

206
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's the bestest race car in the whole wide world.

207
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he is, how you say,

208
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"The bestest race car," Then why must he rest? Huh?

209
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause he knows what's important.

210
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every now and then he prefers just to slow down, enjoy life.

211
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh! You heard it! Lightning McQueen prefers to be slow!

212
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not news to Francesco.

213
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I want to go to sleep, I watch one of his races.

214
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After two laps, I am out cold.

215
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That ain't what I meant.

216
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on over there?

217
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is afraid of Francesco.

218
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's that Italian formula car.

219
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- His name is...  - Francesco Bernoulli.

220
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No wonder there's a crowd.  - Why do you know his name?

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And don't say it like that. It's three syllables, not ten.

222
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? He's nice to look at. You know, open-wheeled and all.

223
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's wrong with fenders?  - Nothing.

224
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you liked my fenders.

225
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let me tell you something else.  - Mater?

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}McQueen could drive circles around you.

227
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Driving in circles is all he can-a do, no?

228
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

229
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, yes. I mean, he could beat you anywhere.

230
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any time, any track.

231
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mel, can we move on?

232
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Francesco needs a caller who can provide

233
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a little more intellectual stimulation,

234
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like a dump truck.

235
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ha-ha! That shows what you know. Dump trucks is dumb.

236
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, hi. This is Lightning McQueen.

237
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Lightning McQueen, huh?

238
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't appreciate my best friend being insulted like that.

239
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}McQueen, that was your best friend? Oh!

240
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the difference between you and Francesco.

241
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Francesco knows how good he is.

242
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He does not need to surround himself with tow trucks to prove it.

243
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those are strong words from a car that is so fragile.

244
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fragile! He calls Francesco fragile!

245
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not-a so fast, McQueen!

246

248
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This sounds like something

249
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that needs to be settled on the race course.

250
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you say, Lightning McQueen?

251
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got room for one more racer.

252
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would love to, but my crew is off for the season, so...

253
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pit stop.

254
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? They just got back.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Deal me in, baby.

256
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, I know. I just got back, but we won't be long.

257
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:19,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, don't worry about me. I've got enough to do here.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater's going to have a blast, though.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're bringing Mater, right?

260
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never bring him to any of your races.

261
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just let him sit in the pits. Give him a headset.

262
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, it will be the thrill of a lifetime for him.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you believe this party?

306
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You done good. You got all the leaves.

307
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Check out that tow truck.  - Man, I wonder who that guy's with.

308
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah... Will you guys excuse me just for one little second?

309
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ho-ho! Good job!

310
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater! Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.

311
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're just realizing that?

312
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh-ho! That jet lag really done a number on you.

313
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater, things are different over here.

314
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which means maybe you should,

315
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you know, act a little different, too.

316
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Different than what?  - Well, just help me out here.

317
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need help? Shoot! Why didn't you say so?

318
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what a tow truck does.

319
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah, I mean...  - Looky there.

320
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Mr. San Francisco. I'll introduce you.

321
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mater, no!  - Look at me. I'm helping you already.

322
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you to meet...

323
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.

324
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nice to meet you, Francesco.  - Nice to meet you, too.

325
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are very good-looking. Not as good as I thought, but good.

326
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. Can I get a picture with you?

327
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything for McQueen's friend.

328
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss Sally is going to flip when she sees this.

329
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend.

330
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's a big fan of yours.

331
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, she has-a good taste.

332
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater's prone to exaggeration. I wouldn't say she's a "Big fan".

333
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right. She's a huge fan!

334
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She goes on and on about your open wheels.

335
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mentioning it once doesn't qualify as going on and on.

336
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Francesco is familiar with this reaction to Francesco.

337
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Women respect a car that has-a nothing to hide.

338
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let us have a toast.  - Let's.

339
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I dedicate my win tomorrow to Miss Sally.

340
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Sorry.

341
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I already dedicated my win tomorrow to her.

342
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, if we both do it, it's really not so special.

343
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Besides, I don't have a drink.  - I'll go get you one.

344
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you mind if I borrow a few bucks for one of them drinks?

345
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:16,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They're free. Mater.  - Free? Shoot, what am I doing here?

346
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should probably go keep an eye on him.

347
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you at the race.

348
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:24,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, you will see Francesco, but not like this.

349
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will see him like-a this as he drives away from you.

350
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,470


351
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ha! That's cute.

352
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You had one of those made up for all the racers?

353
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

354
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

355
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Ciao, McQueen! - He is so getting beat tomorrow!

356
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlecars, Sir Miles Axlerod.

357
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is my absolute honor to introduce to you

358
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:51,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the competitors in the first ever World Grand Prix.

359
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From Brazil, Number 8...

360
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, hello. - Hello.

361
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator.

362
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's because it's air-cooled.

363
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. I'm Agent Shiftwell.

364
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo station.

365
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I have a message from London. - Not here.

366
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must try the canape on the mezzanine.

367
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The lab boys analyzed the photo I sent?

368
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did they learn about the camera?

369
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It appears to be a standard television camera.

370
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They said if you could get

371
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}closer photos next time that would be great.

372
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was London's message?

373
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. No, sir.

374
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The oil platforms you were on,

375
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}turns out they're sitting

376
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on the biggest oil reserve in the world.

377
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did we miss that?

378
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've scrambled everyone's satellites.

379
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Americans discovered it just before you did.

380
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They placed an agent on that platform under deep cover.

381
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was able to get a photo

382
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of the car who's running the entire operation.

383
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great.

384
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is it? Has anyone seen the photo yet?

385
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nope, not yet.

386
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The American is here tonight to pass it to you.

387
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll signal you when he's ready.

388
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good, good.

389
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

390
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What is it? - Change of plan.

391
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're meeting the American. - What? Me?

392
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those thugs down there were on the oil platform.

393
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If they see me, the mission is compromised.

394
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm technical. I'm in diagnostics.

395
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm... I'm not a field agent.

396
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are now.

397
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll take one of them. Thank you.

398
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never know which one McQueen will have a hankering for.

399
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. What you got here that's free?

400
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about that pistachio ice cream?

401
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, no, wasabi. - Same old same old.

402
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's up with you? That looks delicious!

403
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Er... little more, please. It is free, right?

404
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep it coming. A little more.

405
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,810

426
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This trip's been amazin'.

00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm leakin'. I never leak. I never leak.

438
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never leak, I never leak, I never leak.

439
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, oh, I never leak. Oooh!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, so, the American has activated his tracking beacon.

445
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roger that. Move in.

00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, you've got to be joking. - What's the problem?

448
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's in the loo. - So, go in!

449
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't go into the men's loo!

450
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time is of the essence.

451
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

452
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:36,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh! Whatever you do, I would not go in there!

453
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! A Gremlin and a Pacer!

454
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No offense to your makes and models,

455
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you break down harder than my cousin Betsy

456
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}after she got left at the altar!

457

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the? Whoa. Are you OK?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you don't mind.

461
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah, sorry.

462
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't let me get in the way of your private business.

463
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, a little advice.

464
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you hear a giggle and see that waterfall,

465
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you best press that green button.

00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thank you. - It's to adjust the temperature.

467
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Got it. - And it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit.

468
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of here!

469
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, then. And when

470

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she starts gigglin', prepare to be squirted.

471
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}EXcuse me, ma'am.

472
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad-gum pistachio ice cream.

473
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:24,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This cannot be him. - Is he American?

474
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look out, ladies. Mater's fittin' to get funky.

475
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Extremely. - Then it's him.

476
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello. - Well, hello.

477
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator.

478
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, of course it doesn't. That's 'cause it's air-cooled.

479
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perfect. Erm... I'm from the Tokyo Station.

00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Course, Karmann Ghias weren't the only ones.

481
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides the Beetles, you had

482
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Type 3 Squarebacks with the Pancake motors.

483
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah, OK. I get it. - And before both of them

484
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there's the Type 2 buses.

485
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- My buddy Fillmore's one of them. - Listen!

486
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Erm... We should find somewhere more private.

487
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gee, don't you think that's a little?

488
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:57,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right.

489
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Impossible to know which areas here are compromised.

490
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So, when can I see you again? - Well, let's see.

491
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races. - Got it.

492
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll rendezvous then.

493
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you are. Where have you been?

494
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:10,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's a "Rendezvous"?

495
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Er... It's like a date. - A date?

496
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater, what's going on?

497
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on is I got me a date tomorrow.

498
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guido don't believe you.

499
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:22,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Believe it. My new girlfriend just said so.

500
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, there she is. Hey! Hey, lady!

501
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you tomorrow!

502
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guido still don't believe you.

503
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got to admit, you tricked us real good.

504
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we don't like being tricked.

505
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's so funny?

506
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I was just wearing a disguise.

507
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys are stuck looking like that.

508
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Allinol? Thanks, fellas. I hear this stuff is good for you.

509
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you think.

510
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Allinol by itself is good for you.

511
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But after microscopic examination

512
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have found that it has one small weakness.

513
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When hit with an electromagnetic pulse,

514
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:07,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it becomes extremely dangerous.

515
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smile for the camera.

516
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that all you want? I got a whole act.

517
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were very interested in this camera on the oil platform.

518
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:19,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, you will witness what it really does.

519
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever you say, Professor.

520
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You talked up a lot of cars last night.

521
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Which one's your associate? - Your mother.

522
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, I'm sorry, it was your sister.

523
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't tell them apart these days.

524
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could I start it now, Professor Z?

525
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go 50% Power.

526
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This camera is actually an electromagnetic pulse emitter.

527
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about her? Did you give it to her?

528
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The allinol is now heating to a boil,

529
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}dramatically expanding,

530
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}causing the engine block to crack under the stress,

531
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}forcing oil into the combustion chamber.

532
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about him? Did you talk to him?

533
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do I care? I can replace an engine block.

534
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:01,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You may be able to, but after full impact of the pulse...

535
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}unfortunately, there will be nothing to replace.

536
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about him? Does he have it?

537
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's him. He's the one.

538
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Roger that, Professor Z. - No!

539
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir.

540
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We believe the infiltrator

541
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}has passed along sensitive information.

542
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will take care of it before any damage can be done.

543
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The project is still on schedule.

544
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will find the second agent and kill him.

545
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Japan, land of the rising sun,

546
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where ancient tradition meets modern technology.

547
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to the inaugural running of the World Grand Prix.

548
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Brent Mustangburger here

549
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with racing legends

550
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap.

551
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's never been a competition like this before.

552
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First, allinol, making its debut tonight

553
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:04,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as the required fuel for all these great champions.

554
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Second, the course itself.

555
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's like nothing we've ever seen before.

556
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}David, how exactly does this competition work?

557
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All three of these street courses

558
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are classic round-the-house racetracks.

559
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This means that the LMP and formula cars

560
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}should break out of the gate in spectacular fashion.

561
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look for Francesco Bernoulli, in particular, to lead early.

562
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And with technical turns throughout, GT and touring cars,

563
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like Spain's Miguel Camino, should make up ground

564
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I doubt it'll be enough to stop Francesco

565
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from absolutely running away with it.

566
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa now. Hold your horsepower.

567
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You forget the most important factor

568
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that early dirt track section of the course.

569
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The dirt is supposed to be the great equalizer in this race.

570
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}French rally car Raoul Sa Roule

571
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is counting on a big boost through there.

572
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And don't forget Lightning McQueen.

573
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His mentor, the Hudson Hornet,

574
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was one of the greatest dirt track racers of all time.

575
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In my opinion, McQueen is

576
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the best all-around racer in this competition.

577
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really, Darrell, you need to clean your windshield.

578
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're clearly not seeing this for what it is:

579
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Francesco's race to lose.

580
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time to find out.

581
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The racers are locking into the grid.

582
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:17,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Speed. I am speed.

583
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? You are speed?

584
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then Francesco is triple speed.

585
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Francesco is triple speed.

586
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ho-ho! Francesco likes-a this McQueen.

587
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's-a really getting him into the zone.

588
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:35,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is so getting beat today.

589
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your suspension sets look good.

590
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tire pressure is excellent!

591
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got plenty of fuel.

592
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he's awesome.

593
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed. - It's his cover.

594
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of the best I've seen, too.

595
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at the detail on that rust.

596
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It must have cost him a fortune.

597
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But why hasn't he contacted us yet?

598
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's probably heat on him.

599
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Be patient. - Right, of course.

600
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll signal us when he can.

601
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we find out who's behind all this.

602
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As they head into the palace hairpin,

603
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Francesco builds an early lead.

604
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang on, boys. Here comes the dirt.

605
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slipping and sliding, baby.

606
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}McQueen, it's time to make your move!

607
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,420

00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A flame-thrower? What are you talking about?

810
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a first-class VIP airport whatchamacallit.

811
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:30,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, Finn, this here is my date.

812
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never did get your name.

813
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:35,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell. Holley Shiftwell.

814
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:36,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Shiftwell. Holley...

815
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finally. Time to see who's behind all this.

816
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:43,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this?

817
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's one of the worst engines ever made.

818
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's an old aluminum V8 with

819
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a Lucas electrical system and Whitworth bolts.

820
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:54,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain, tell you what.

821
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Them ain't metric, they ain't inches.

822
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, OK, but whose engine is this?

823
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's kinda hard to tell from this picture, ain't it?

824
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:03,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But you're the one who took it. - Holley.

825
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Right! Yes, of course.

826
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:08,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed.

827
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:11,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Agent? You mean, like, insurance agent? Like...

828
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like a good neighbor, Mater is there!

829
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! You mean secret agents! You guys is spies!

830
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:22,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holley. In how many makes and models did this type of engine appear?

831
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:26,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was standard in seven models over a 12-year period.

832
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least 35,000 cars were made with this engine.

833
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:31,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're purty. - Yes, alright, thank you.

834
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:35,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And so nice. - Just pay attention.

835
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:37,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This seems like a dead end.

836
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If there was something in the photo that

837
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}could narrow this down a bit, I'd be a lot happier.

838
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:43,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You might not be happy,

839
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:45,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I bet this feller is.

840
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See how he's had most of his parts replaced?

841
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And see all them boxes over there?

842
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:52,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Them's all original parts. They ain't easy to come by.

843
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Rare parts? - That's something we can track.

844
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly.

845
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well done, Mater. I would never have seen that.

846
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know of a black-market

847
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}parts dealer in Paris, a treacherous lowlife,

848
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but he's the only car in the

849
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:07,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}world who can tell us whose engine this is.

850
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:09,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater. What would you say to

851
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}setting up an informal task force on this one?

852
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. What?

853
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:15,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You obviously have experience in the field.

854
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I live right next to one.

855
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Finn.

856
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:22,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I ain't exactly been much help to anybody recently.

857
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:24,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're helping me. Please, Mater.

858
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well... Okay.

859
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:29,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you know I'm just a tow truck, right?

860
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right. And I'm just in the import-export business.

861
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Siddeley? - Yes, Finn?

862
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:35,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paris. Tout de suite.

863
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, two of them sweets for me, too, Sid.

864
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:40,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always wanted to be a spy.

865
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? Me, too.

866
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Afterburners, sir? - Is there any other way?

867
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once we're inside, stay close.

868
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:20,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't bother checking VIN numbers or criminal records.

869
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're all dodgy here.

870
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:22,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No VIN scan. Got it.

871
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't talk to anyone, don't look at anyone,

872
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and absolutely, positively no idling. Are we clear?

873
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:29,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. No idling. Yes, sir.

874
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:32,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mater? - Yeah, Finn?

875
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not here to go shopping.

876
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shoppin'? What do you mean?

877
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would I...

878
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad-gum.

879
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Part for sales, monsieur.

880
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Monsieur, part for sale.

881
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta be kiddin'. They got everything here. No!

882
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at them hoods! I could use a hood.

883
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, fellers. I gotta go!

884

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do what?

885
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:00,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. What are you selling?

886
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Headlights, monsieur, headlights?

887
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:03,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What in the? - Two for one.

888
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:05,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I give you good price! - I'm good!

889
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There you are. - There is some great bargains here.

890
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mater, get back! - Imbecile!

891
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, wait for me!

892
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:51,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Have you lost your mind? - But I thought...

893
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:53,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This chap needs a tow. Hook him up.

894
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure thing.

895
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:59,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You rusty piece of junk! Get your dirty hook off me!

896
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Electroshock! Are you kidding me?

897
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is her first field assignment.

898
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She didn't know you were my informant.

899
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Informant? - A rookie, huh?

900
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never liked new car smell.

901
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:21,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomber was doing 20-to-life in a Moroccan impound

902
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:24,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the first time I saved him, if I recall correctly.

903
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Speaking of recalls,

904
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're getting up there in mileage, aren't you, Finn?

905
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, we get it. You both know each other, you're both old.

906
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:33,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, here you go, informant. Inform us.

907
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:37,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beuck! That is the worst motor ever made.

908
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. That oil filter. Those wheel bearings.

909
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:43,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do those parts look familiar, Tomber?

910
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They should. I sold them.

911
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:47,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- To whom? - No idea.

912
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's my best customer,

913
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but he always does his business over the phone.

914
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was always wondering why he needs so many parts.

915
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I know.

916
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A lemon needs parts. Ain't nothin' truer than that.

917
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:01,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Lemon? - Yeah. Cars that don't ever work right.

918
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter.

919
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:06,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like 'em Gremlins and Pacers we run into at the party

920
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:08,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the race and the airport.

921
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pull up the pictures from the oil platform.

922
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to know what other type of cars were out there.

923
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:17,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right. Let's see. There were Hugos and Trunkovs.

924
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:18,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are these cars considered lemons?

925
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is the Popemobile Catholic?

926
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:22,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone involved in this

927
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}plot is one of history's biggest loser cars.

928
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they're all taking

929
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}their orders from the car behind this engine.

930
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Ah. This explains it. - What, Tomber?

931
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:34,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkov never get together,

932
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:37,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but they are having a secret meeting in two days.

933
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where's this meeting taking place? - Porto Corsa, Italy.

934
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's where the next race is!

935
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a good chance our mystery engine will be there, too.

936
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:47,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your chances are more than good.

937
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:49,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just sent him a new clutch assembly yesterday.

938
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:50,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To Porto Corsa.

939
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:54,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holley. Contact Stevenson and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon.

940
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good work.

941
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:04,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That three-wheeled feller had to be right about a big meetin'.

942
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never see this many lemons in one town.

943
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Less there's a swap meet.

944
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd you get all them pictures?

945
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:14,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I reprogrammed Porto Corsa's

946
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}red light cameras to do recognition scans.

947
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:19,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. Not only is you the purtiest car I ever met,

948
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you're the smartest, too.

949
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you... I think.

950
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:27,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a familiar sight. A Hugo being towed.

951
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he looks absolutely perfect!

952
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course! They must be the heads of the lemon families.

953
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:35,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Makes sense. If I was rich and broke down every day,

954
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:37,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd hire me to tow me around all the time, too!

955
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:39,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got to infiltrate that meeting

956
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the only way to find out who's behind all this.

957
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hang on a minute.  - What

958
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold still.

959
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:52,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah-ha. Good job, Miss Shiftwell.

960
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:53,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Finn.

961
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:55,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boy, I sure wish my friends could see me now.

962
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guido, your eyes do not deceive you.

963
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are in Italy. We are home.

964
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Luigi. Which way to the hotel, man?

965
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:15,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No friend of mine will stay in a hotel in-a my village.

966
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:19,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will stay with my... Uncle Topolino-o-o-o!

967
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:22,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Luigi! Guido!

968
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:34,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do they do it?

969
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are the same ingredients as back home,

970
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:37,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but it tastes so good.

971
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:40,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's organic, man. - Treehugger.

972
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:45,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, race car.

973
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:47,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look so down, so low.

974
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:49,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is like you have flat tires.

975
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:56,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said you look like you are starving,

976
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that she's gonna make you a big meal and fatten you up.

977
00:55:58,710 --> 00:55:59,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

978
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mama Topolino, please, you don't need to make a fuss.

979
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Capisco. I understand.

980
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:08,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is a problem, yes, between you and a friend?

981
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you know that?

982
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A wise car hears one word and understands two.

983
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:15,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That, and Luigi told me.

984
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}While Mama cooks, come and take a stroll with me.

985
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:22,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I brought my friend Mater along on the trip

986
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:24,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I told him he needed to act different,

987
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:26,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that we weren't in Radiator Springs.

988
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:28,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This Mater is a close friend?

989
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's my best friend.

990
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:33,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then why would you ask him to be someone else?

991
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did I do?

992
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said some things during our fight.

993
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:44,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, back when Guido and Luigi used to work for me,

994
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:47,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they would fight over everything.

995
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They fight over what Ferrari was the best Ferrari,

996
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:54,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which one of them looked more like a Ferrari.

997
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:56,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There were even some non-Ferrari fights.

998
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I tell them, "Va bene, it's OK to fight.

999
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Everybody fights now and then, especially best friends.

1000
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"But you got to make up fast.

1001
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"No fight more important than friendship. "

1002
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:23,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What does that mean? - Whoever find a friend, find a treasure.

1003
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:25,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, mangia. Eat!

1004
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:39,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.

1005
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Stevenson.

1006
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That should just about do it. - Perfect.

1007
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:46,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, Mater, it's voice-activated.

1008
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:49,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, you know, everything's voice-activated these days.

1009
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? I thought you was supposed to be makin' me a disguise.

1012
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,230

00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:21,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater.

1020
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:23,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I just go in, pretend to be this truck.

1021
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And leave the rest to us. - Now, hold still.

1023
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:34,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's no good. Hm.

1024
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. What are you doin'?

1025
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The disguise won't calibrate

1026
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}effectively without a smooth surface to graft onto.

1027
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For a second there, I thought you was tryin' to fix my dents.

1031
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They way too valuable.

1032
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your dents are valuable? Really?

1033
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:00,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I come by each one of 'em with my best friend, Lightning McQueen.

1034
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't fix these. I wanna remember these dents forever.

1035
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you were being serious in Paris?

1036
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:09,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}McQueen isn't just part of your cover.

1037
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:12,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Friendships can be dangerous in our line of work, Mater.

1038
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:14,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But my line of work is towin' and salvage.

00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:18,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I meant for real.

1041
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's OK. Say no more. I'll work around the dent.

1042
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:23,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the meantime...

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you look a little light on weapons.

1044
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,380


1045

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'd better.

1070

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Impossible.

1111
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:04,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just apply the same level of dedication

1112
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:07,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you've been using to play the idiot tow truck,

1113
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:09,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you'll be fine.

1114
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:12,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just that them guys look purty tough and...

01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:13,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, did you say "Idiot"?

1116
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that how you see me?

1117
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:17,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's how everyone sees you.

01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't that the idea?

1119
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tell you, that's the genius of it.

1120
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one realizes they're being fooled

1121
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:25,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because they're too busy laughing at the fool.

1122
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brilliant!

01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:35,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on! There's no time! Go! - OK. OK.

1125
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:38,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Computer, disguise! - Request acknowledged.

1126
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:46,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the boss. He's coming.

1127

01:03:56,070 --> 01:04:00,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ivan, why do you insult me so by making me wait here?

1129
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:10,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's in.

1130
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The racers are now making their way around the hairpin

01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:18,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and headed downhill toward the casino bridge.

1132
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No more bets, please.

1133
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:37,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, fuzzy dice!

01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:40,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Number four. Easy four. - Yeah!

1135
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:42,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Air freshener. Antenna balls.

01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This place looks like it's made outta gold!

1138
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:49,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's because it is. Now, be careful what you say.

1139
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:51,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is that?

1140
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:53,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean, "Don't talk to ya"?

1141
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:56,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want me to stop talkin' to ya right now?

1142
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:57,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are acting strange today, Ivan.

1143
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:02,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have no idea what you're talking about,

1144

01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that makes sense,

1147

01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just the professor.

1165
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:53,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Zudapp! When is he coming?

01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:05,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but my clutch assembly broke.

1171
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:07,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You know how it is. - Forget about it.

1172
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:09,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We know how you feel.

1173
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:11,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Descramble that voice. - I'm trying.

1174
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, it's too sophisticated.

1175
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are here to celebrate.

1176
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Today, all your hard work pays off.

1177
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:22,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The world turned their backs on cars like us.

1178
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:26,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They stopped manufacturing us, stopped making our parts.

1179
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:30,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only thing they haven't stopped doing is laughing at us.

1180
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:33,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've called us terrible names:

1181
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:35,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jalopy, rust bucket, heap,

1182
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:40,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}clunker, junker, beater, wreck, rattletrap,

1183
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:42,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lemon.

1184
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But their insults just give us strength.

1185
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:51,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because today, my friends, that all ends!

1186
01:06:52,610 --> 01:06:54,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's smoke on the casino bridge!

1187
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:55,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no!

1188
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:57,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Carla Veloso, the Brazilian race car!

1189
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What just happened? - I'm working on it.

1190
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:10,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They laughed at us, but now it's our turn to laugh back.

1191
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:15,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Another crash! It's number 9, Nigel Gearsley.

1192
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Embrace your inner lemon.

1193
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let it drive you.

1194
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:23,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm detecting an extremely strong electromagnetic pulse.

1195
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:28,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Finn, it's the camera. - Where?

1196
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:30,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On the tower!

1197
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:37,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was meant to be alternative fuel's greatest moment.

1198
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:41,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But after today, everyone will race back to gasoline.

1199
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:46,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we, the owners of the world's largest untapped oil reserve

1200
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:48,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will become the most powerful cars in the world!

1201
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:50,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of the way!

1202
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:26,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They will come to us,

1203
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:27,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they will have no choice,

1204
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:28,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because they will need us.

1205
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We figured you might stop by!

1206
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:46,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they will finally respect us!

1207
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So hold your hoods high!

1208
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:52,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After today, you will never again be ashamed of who you are!

1209
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:54,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

1210
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:55,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:55,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I suppose that...

1225
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:59,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The show must go on, as they say.

01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you require all the racers to still run on allinol?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The final race will not be run on allinol.

01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:54,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but something like that should never happen.

1249
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:57,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can choose your fuel for the final race.

1250

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have any idea what it'll be?

01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's good enough for me.

01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:12,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So a surprising revelation from Lightning McQueen.

1313
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me go!

1314
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:55,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You actually care about that race car.

1315
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:58,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A pity you didn't warn him in time.

1316
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Idiot"? Is that how you see me?

1317
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's how everyone sees you.

1318
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tell you, that's the genius of it.

1319
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:13,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one realizes they're being fooled

1320
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because they're too busy laughing at the fool.

1321
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:18,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At the fool...

1322
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:20,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me!

1323
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:22,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Domo arigato!

1324
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:28,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You done good. You got all the leaves.

1325
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check out that tow truck.

1326
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:30,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wonder who that guy's with.

1327
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:33,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you guys excuse me just for one little second?

1328
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now that's a scoop of ice cream!

1329
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:46,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody get me water! Oh, sweet relief.

1330
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:47,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater!

1331
01:14:52,770 --> 01:14:54,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I never leak oil. Never.

1332
01:14:54,710 --> 01:14:57,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get a hold of yourself. You're making a scene!

1333
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:59,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute. I didn't screw you up, did I?

1334
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I lost the race because of you!

1335
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:02,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe if I talked to somebody...

1336
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't need your help!

1337
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:06,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want your help.

1338
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your help...

1339
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:11,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bang the gong. Get it on!

1340
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs.

1341
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:17,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is exactly why I don't bring you along to these things!

1342
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:30,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holley! Finn! Where are we?

1343
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:33,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're in London, Mater, inside Big Bentley.

1344
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, this... This is all my fault.

1345
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be a fool, Mater.

1346
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:56,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I am, remember? You said so.

1347
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When did I... Oh.

1348
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:02,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater, I was complimenting you on what a good spy you are.

1349
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:04,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not a spy!

1350
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:09,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been trying to tell you that the whole time.

1351
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:11,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really am just a tow truck.

1352
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:13,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finn, he's not joking.

1353
01:16:13,950 --> 01:16:14,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

1354
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.

1355
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:21,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what's happened to McQueen is 'cause I'm such a big one.

1356
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:24,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is all my fault.

1357
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:29,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good. You're up. - And just in time.

1358
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:32,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Professor Z wanted you to have a front-row seat,

1359
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for the death of Lightning McQueen.

1360
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:37,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's still alive? - Not for much longer.

1361
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:52,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We came as soon as you called.

1362
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:53,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I called to talk to Mater.

1363
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:56,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It never occurred to me he wouldn't be there.

1364
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:58,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard now.

1365
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:01,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Sarge is in touch with his friends in the British military.

1366
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just need to focus on the race.

1367
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:05,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know but, Sally with everything going on, I'm not sure...

1368
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:09,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sir Axlerod. - I'm sorry to interrupt.

1369
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:12,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's all right. - I just wanted to personally thank you.

1370
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:15,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because after Italy, I was finished,

1371
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:17,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then you gave me one last shot.

1372
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:18,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen...

1373
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I probably shouldn't be saying this,

1374
01:17:20,190 --> 01:17:22,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I hope you win today.

1375
01:17:22,350 --> 01:17:25,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You show the world that they've been wrong about allinol.

1376
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:29,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater would want you to race.

1377
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. For Mater.

1378
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:07,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here he comes.

1379
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:27,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What happened? - I don't know, Professor.

1380
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:29,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What did you do? - I didn't do nothing.

1381
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:33,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ssh, I'm talking to the Professor. What's that, Professor?

1382
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:34,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You broke it! - Quiet!

1383
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:37,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I understand, sir. Yes. - What did he say?

1384
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:40,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We go to the back-up plan. - Back-up plan?

1385
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:42,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit.

1386
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The next time he makes a stop, instead of saying "Ka-chow"...

1387
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:48,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he's going to go "Ka-boom"!

1388
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:52,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't feel bad, tow truck. You couldn't have saved him.

1389
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:54,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, wait, you could have!

1390
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Dad-gum lemons! -Request acknowledged.

1391
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:00,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? You didn't think we'd take your bullets?

1392
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right! You got nothing!

1393
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:08,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's the lemon now, huh?

1394
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:13,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice try, Mater.

1395
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad-gum... Dad-gum... Dad-gum.

1396
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:17,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Request... Request... Request...

1397
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater!

1398
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:26,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got to get y'all out of there.

1399
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:29,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no time. McQueen needs your help.

1400
01:19:29,410 --> 01:19:31,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I can't. I'm just a tow truck.

1401
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:34,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's up to you. Go to the pits and get everyone out.

1402
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You can do that. - What about you guys?

1403
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:40,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We'll be OK. - Go and get some more dents, Mater.

1404
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:51,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, we'll be OK? Really?

1405
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wouldn't have left if I'd told him the truth.

1406
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:56,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Being killed by a clock.

1407
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:59,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gives a whole new meaning to "Your time has come. "

1408
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:01,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time? That's it!

1409
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you doing? - Trying to turn back time.

1410
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:19,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I can just reverse the polarity.

1411
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,730

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's everybody on the wrong side of the road for?

1413
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:38,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no!

1414
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:40,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drive! Burn rubber!

01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:24,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mater? - Everybody, get out now!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to me. The bomb is on you!

1431
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:40,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They knew you'd try to help McQueen.

1432
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:41,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to me. The bomb is on you!

1433
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:42,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They knew you'd try to help McQueen.

01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When we were knocked out,

01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:50,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Uh-oh. - Mater! There you are!

01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:57,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm not OK! Stay away from me!

1440
01:21:58,590 --> 01:21:59,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, wait! Wait!

1441
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:02,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A tow truck has just raced onto the track,

01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:03,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he's driving backwards!

1443
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:05,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater, wait!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a conversation with the tow truck.

01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:36,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}McQueen, you don't get it! I'm the bomb!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's he saying? What's wrong?

1513
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:46,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}None of his wrenches fit the bolts.

1514
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get it. I get it!

1515
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:53,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I know what needs to be done. - Then do it!

1516
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No. I can't do it.

1517
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:57,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody takes me seriously.

1518
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:01,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that now. This ain't Radiator Springs.

1519
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:02,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, it is.

1520
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:05,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, you're yourself in Radiator Springs.

1521
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:07,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be yourself here.

1522
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if people aren't taking you seriously,

1523
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then they need to change, not you.

1524
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that because I was wrong before.

1525
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:17,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, you can do this. You're the bomb.

1526
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:19,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, buddy.

1527
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:21,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you're the actual bomb. Now, let's go!

1528
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:23,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, right. Hang on!

1529
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:27,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's he going?

1530
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:31,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Computer!  - Yes, Agent Mater?

1531
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:34,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need that thing you done before to get me away from McQueen!

1532
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:35,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Request acknowledged.

1533
01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:41,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mater? - Now I need you to do the chute!

1534
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:43,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The second kind, not the first!

1535
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:45,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Deploying chute.

1536
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:10,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's winning the race?

1537
01:29:14,780 --> 01:29:17,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Back off! Back away! - It's Lightning McQueen!

1538
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:20,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's OK! Tell 'em, Mater. Explain.

1539
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:21,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1540
01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:22,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody's been sabotaging

1541
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:25,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the racers and hurtin' the cars, and I know who.

1542
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:26,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, wait. Your Majesty.

1543
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:29,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bomb! It's a bomb!

1544
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:32,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Everybody, down! - Back up! Move it!

1545
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get off the stage! Move it!

1546
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:39,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold your fire! He can't disarm it!

1547
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:42,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater, I don't know what you're doing,

1548
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:42,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but stand down now.

1549
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This ain't nothing at all like Radiator Springs.

1550
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater, just cut to the chase.

1551
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. It's him.

1552
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:52,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? Me? You've got to be crazy.

1553
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:56,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I figured it out when I realized y'all attached

1554
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this ticking time bomb with Whitworth bolts -

1555
01:29:58,690 --> 01:30:00,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the same bolts that hold together

1556
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:02,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that old British engine from the photograph.

1557
01:30:03,430 --> 01:30:04,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Holley! Show that picture. - OK.

1558
01:30:05,130 --> 01:30:07,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remembered what they say about old British engines.

1559
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:10,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If there ain't no oil under 'em, there ain't no oil in 'em.

1560
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is he talking about?

1561
01:30:12,670 --> 01:30:15,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was you leaking oil at the party in Japan.

1562
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:16,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just blamed it on me.

1563
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:19,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Electric cars don't use oil, you twit.

1564
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:22,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you're fakin' it. You didn't convert to no electric.

1565
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:25,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we pop that hood,

1566
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:26,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll see that engine from that picture.

1567
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:30,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This lorry's crazy! He's going to kill us all!

1568
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay away!

1569
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:34,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Sir Axlerod created the race.

1570
01:30:34,730 --> 01:30:36,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would he want to hurt anyone?

1571
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:40,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To make allinol look bad so everybody'd go back to using oil.

1572
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:42,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said it himself with that disguised voice.

1573
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Disguised voice? What are you talking about?

1574
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:47,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're nuts, you are!

1575
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:48,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is going nowhere fast.

1576
01:30:48,470 --> 01:30:49,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We really should go, Grandmother.

1577
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One moment, I'd like to see where this is going.

1578
01:30:53,710 --> 01:30:55,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater, he created allinol.

1579
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:57,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what if he found that huge oil field

1580
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just as the world, was he trying to find something else?

1581
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:01,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if he came up with

1582
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}allinol just to make alternative fuel look bad?

1583
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:06,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"What if?" You're basing this on a "What if"?

1584
01:31:06,930 --> 01:31:08,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Okay, that's it. - Lads, clear out.

1585
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:12,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! Somebody save me! The lorry's crazy!

1586
01:31:12,330 --> 01:31:14,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Keep away, you idiot! - Mater!

1587
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mater! - Someone do something!

1588
01:31:20,170 --> 01:31:22,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're insane, you are! Deactivate!

1589
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:28,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bomb deactivated. Have a nice day, Sir Axlerod.

1590
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:39,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The engine from the photo. - It's a perfect match.

1591
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did the tow truck figure it out?

1592
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:45,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's official. You're coming to all my races from now on.

1593
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:47,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you're talkin'!

1594
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:57,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mater, let's go. You're on.

1595
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your Majesty, may I present

1596
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:05,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for the investiture of

1597
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:08,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}honorary knighthood of the British Realm...

1598
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:12,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tow Mater of Radiator Springs.

1599
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:14,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go get 'em, buddy.

1600
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:26,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hereby dub thee Sir Tow Mater.

1601
01:32:28,270 --> 01:32:31,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir? Shoot, you can just call me Mater, Your Majesty.

1602
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna hear none of this "Sir" Business.

1603
01:32:34,010 --> 01:32:36,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the way, have y'all met each other?

1604
01:32:36,110 --> 01:32:37,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Queen, McQueen. McQueen, Queen.

1605
01:32:37,980 --> 01:32:39,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}McQueen, McMissile.

1606
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:39,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}McMissile, McQueen.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Queen, McMissile.

1608
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:48,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So there we were, my rocket jets going full blast,

1609
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:50,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}McQueen hanging on for dear life

1610
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:52,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when suddenly them two nasty

01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:56,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We was goners.

1613
01:32:56,900 --> 01:33:00,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But then, out of nowhere this beautiful spy car

1614
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:02,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}swoops in from the sky to save us!

1615
01:33:02,270 --> 01:33:05,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a very entertaining story, young man.

1616
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:07,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Minny, please. Come on!

1617
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:11,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}None of this happened. Rocket jets, flying spy cars.

1618
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:14,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you're quite right. It does sound a bit far-fetched.

1619
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holley! What are you doin' here?

1620
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:19,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Mater! It's so good to see you again.

1621
01:33:19,790 --> 01:33:20,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finn!

1622
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:22,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our satellites picked up an urgent communiqu?

1623
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,820

1625
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:31,300

01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:32,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't tell nobody.

1627
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:34,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this is Holley Shiftwell.

1628
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:36,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She's... - I'm Mater's girlfriend.

1629
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's so nice to meet you all.

1630
01:33:38,870 --> 01:33:41,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guido believe you now.

1631
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:43,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, honey. You got a nasty dent there.

1632
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:45,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. - Was that from when you swooped in

1633
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:47,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you saved them in London?

1634
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:49,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Van! - What? I'm just asking!

1635
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:51,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you worry. My baby

1636
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:54,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ramone can get that fixed up for you in no time.

1637
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, sure thing. No problemo. Let me go get my tools.

1638
01:33:57,730 --> 01:34:00,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. I'm keeping that dent. It's way too valuable.

1639
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A valuable dent? She's as crazy as Mater.

1640
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:07,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those two are perfect for each other.

1641
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:10,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's one thing I still don't get.

1642
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:13,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The bad guys hit me with the beam from the camera, right?

1643
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:17,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So, why didn't I... - Explode in a fiery inferno?

1644
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:19,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. - We couldn't figure that out, either.

1645
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:22,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our investigation proved that allinol was actually gasoline

1646
01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:23,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Axlerod engineered it so

1647
01:34:23,790 --> 01:34:25,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when it got hit by the beam, it would explode.

1648
01:34:25,950 --> 01:34:29,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a second, Fillmore. You said my fuel was safe!

1649
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:34,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're implying that I

1650
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:37,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}switched that rot-gut excuse for alternative fuel

1651
01:34:37,730 --> 01:34:41,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with my all-natural, sustainable, organic biofuel

1652
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:47,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just because I never trusted Axlerod, you're dead wrong, man!

1653
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:49,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was him!

1654
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:53,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once big oil, always big oil, man.

1655
01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:54,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tree-hugger.

1656
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:59,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Radiator Springs Grand Prix is about to begin.

1657
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:01,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All spectators, clear the starting line.

1658
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't wait to get rockin'. This is gonna be wicked!

1659
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should do this every year.

1660
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:09,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I just figured we

1661
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}never found out who the world's fastest car is.

1662
01:35:12,070 --> 01:35:14,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Plus, no press, no trophy, just racing.

1663
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:18,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The way I like it. - Francesco likes it like this, too.

1664
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:21,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Francesco, I'd like you to meet... - Signorina Sally.

1665
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:23,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is official.

1666
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:26,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lightning McQueen is the luckiest car in the world.

1667
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:28,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1668
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:29,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which he will have to be

1669
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:31,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to have a chance against Francesco today!

1670
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:34,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you at the finish line, Mc... What is that?

1671
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:37,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just something I had made up for the occasion.

1672
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:39,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a good, McQueen. Very funny.

1673
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:42,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was-a funnier when I did it, but it's-a very funny.

1674
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:43,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you going to do next?

1675
01:35:43,990 --> 01:35:45,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you going to take off your fenders?

1676
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:47,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try it. You'll like it.

1677
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, he's not so good-looking.

1678
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. Nice try. - I'm serious!

1679
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:54,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why I love you, Sally.

1680
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:57,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wish me luck! - You don't need it!

1681
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:01,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That Francesco is fine-looking!

1682
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:03,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And those open wheels.

1683
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:06,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ooh, I'm gonna have to go get myself some coolant.

1684
01:36:17,630 --> 01:36:18,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go, Lightning!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Go get 'em, tiger! - Bravo, bravo!

1687
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:44,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Go, Lightning, go! - Go, McQueen!

1688
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finn? Time to go.

1689
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:49,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Siddeley's gassed, geared and ready to fly.

1690
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:53,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're leavin' already? - We've got another mission.

1691
01:36:53,470 --> 01:36:55,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just stopped by here to pick something up.

1692
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:58,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somethin' tells me you're

01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:00,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not talkin' about souvenir bumper stickers.

1694
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:03,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her Majesty asked for you personally, Mater.

1695
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:06,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But I told y'all before, I'm not a spy. - We know.

1696
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:08,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spy or not, you're still the smartest,

1697
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:10,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}most honest chap we've ever met.

1698
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:13,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't forget massively charming. - Well, thanks.

1699
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:16,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But as much fun as it was hangin' with y'all, this...

1700
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:19,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is home.

1701
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:22,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all right. We understand. But I'll be back.

1702
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You still owe me that first date.

1703
01:37:24,730 --> 01:37:27,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know.

1704
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:30,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I sure appreciate that. Thank you.

01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:34,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, there is one thing.

1706
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,980
