鉴于我的职位所应得的尊重
considering the respect the position deserves,

128

你应该开始叫我胡佛局长了

当你听到求救声时

那具尸体不是詹姆斯·达莫迪的

不是认为
Not an opinion.

138
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,010
你说什么
I beg your pardon?

139
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,300
不是认为
It was not an opinion.

什么
What?

151
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,750
你戴眼镜是为了好看  还是真的需要
Are they for reasons of vanity or do you need them to see?

我们说的正是这件事
The exact point that we're debating.

169

我才不信这句鬼话

吉米·达莫迪
Jimmy Darmody.

281
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,450
他怎么了
What about him?

282
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,910
我需要知道他在哪里
I need to know where he is.

283
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,800
他已经火化了
He was cremated

284
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,600
注射毒品过量死在他母亲的浴缸里
after overdosing in his mother's tub.

285
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,520
你我都知道那不是真的
You and I both know that isn't true.

286
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,410
我也是读了报纸才知道
I only know what I read in the papers.

287
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,970
那么你读到吉莉安·达莫迪
Then you've read Gillian Darmody

288
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,630
因谋杀被逮捕的消息了
has been arrested for murder.

289
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,740
可那是荒唐之言
But that's ludicrous.

290
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,170
死在浴缸里的是詹姆斯
It was James who died in that tub.

291
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,680
如果法庭相信了
If they believe that,

292
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,210
她就自由了
she'll go free.

293
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,840
她肯定要来和我争孩子
And she'll come back for the boy to spite me.

294
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,260
经历了那么多磨难
After all of this,

295
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,400
我和我妻子
my wife and I...

296
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,940
是承受不起的
could not bear that.

297
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,250
假如有个匿名线人
If somehow an anonymous source

298
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,390
向官方透露吉米尸体的位置
were to disclose to the authorities

299
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,450
你愿意为这个线人
the whereabouts of Jimmy's body...

300
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,550
做些什么吗
what would you do for that anonymous source?

301
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,240
你要我做什么都行
I would do whatever you asked.

302
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,470
-别挤  各位  -好了好了
- Nice and orderly, guys. - All right, all right.

303
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,830
给医生让路
Let the doctor through.

304
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,920
各位后退一下  讲究点风度
Stand back, boys. A little dignity.

305
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,370
-拍张照片  -回来
- Get a picture. - Come on, get back.

306
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,420
-别推人  -是达莫迪吗
- Hey, don't push. - Is it Darmody?

307
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,520
右腿六根钢钉
Six screws in the right femur.

308
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,940
-是达莫迪  -各位  请后退
- It's him. It's Darmody. - Fellas, please, stand back.

309
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,940
这是达莫迪  那么那个是谁
If that's Darmody, then who's the other one?

310
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,980
拿回来
Hey, get it back!

311
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,010
放松点
Take it easy!

312
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,360
下午版有内容了
Call it in for the afternoon edition.

313
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,870
那我先来
Well, guess I'll kick things off and--

314
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,640
-艾德  -怎么了
- Ed. - Yeah, Nuck?

315
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,670
滚出去
Get the fuck out of here.

316
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,780
这是我办公室啊
It's my office.

317
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,820
别逼我把你拉下来
I'll change that if it's the last thing I do.

318
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,980
我只是做了该做的
I just did what I had to.

319
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,840
你肯定
You of all people--

320
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,120
您最好让我们独处一会
It would be best to leave us be.

321
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,350
-你见过他  -我可没说
- You've seen him. - I didn't say that.

322
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,500
你有他的消息
You've heard from him.

323
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,510
反正不是有就是没有
Either you have or you have not.

324
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,800
要是没有  那就是浪费
If you have not, then my time--

325
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,360
他要了结这一切
He wants this to end.

326
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,830
他不早就找我了结吗
Endings have been attempted, have they not?

327
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,500
-各方面都是  -这关系到他家人
- On all sides. - This is a question of family.

328
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,900
女儿要结婚了  他得出席
His daughter's getting married. He wants to be there.

329
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,730
他想全身而退
He's looking for safe passage in and out.

330
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,010
拿什么交换
In exchange for what?

331
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,470
我就是个牵线的
I'm just the middleman here.

332
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,070
你们不是朋友吗
I thought you were friends.

333
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,120
我没有朋友  只有合作伙伴
I don't have friends. I have partners.

334
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,340
你救过他一命
You tried to save his life.

335
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,810
有回报我才伸手  他现在什么都没有
I bet on a horse to win. He didn't even place.

336
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,350
世道已经变了
Today is a different day.

337
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,780
那你以后要向谁伸手呢
On whom will you wager tomorrow?

338
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,060
我就明说了吧
Let's get something straight, all right?

339
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,790
你的信仰  你过去的悲剧
Your beliefs, your tragic history,

340
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,980
我他妈才懒得听呢
I don't give a rat's ass about any of it.

341
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,380
我们两个人种唯一的共同点
The only thing your people and mine have in common--

342
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,270
就是都认钱
we both know what a dollar's worth.

343
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,530
这里没钱就去那里挣
And if we can't make it one way, we'll make it another.

344
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,480
这座城市是我的蛋糕
I have a lot at stake in this town.

345
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,280
你要是想分一块吃  就等着瞧吧
Try to take it from me, we have a problem.

346
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,320
俱乐部  北城
The club, the Northside,

347
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,000
哪个黑人管都一样
I don't care which of you coloreds runs them,

348
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,670
给我管好就行
as long as they're run.

349
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,300
至于分成  还有你的市长小伙伴
The percentage, your new pal the mayor,

350
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,880
我们回头再说
we'll discuss those later.

351
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,160
这事必须了结掉
This just needs to be over.

352
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,290
怎么了结
Over how?

353
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,310
你们两个谈
That's for you to arrange.

354
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,780
请你解释一下
I urge you to be explicit.

355
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,340
我不希望以后再有人
I don't ever want to worry about that spook

356
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,400
暗地里盯着我
coming at me in the dark again.

357
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,680
明白了吗
Do we understand each other?

358
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,860
明白了
We do.

359
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,750
终于
At long last.

360
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,140
我去找朝琪安排你俩谈谈
Then I'll let Chalky know you're willing to talk.

361
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,910
他要我告诉你件事
Something he wanted me to tell you.

362
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,490
说你肯定感兴趣

That singer.

365
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,950
他说知道她在哪
He says he knows where she is.

366
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,290
买点洋蓟
And be sure to pick up the artichokes.

367
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,150
二十二美分一磅
They're 22 cents a pound.

368
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,990
-那又怎么样  等等  -我可不买
- So? Aspetta. - I'm not paying that.

369
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,160
咱又不是要饭的  洋蓟还买不起
What, are we paupers? I want artichokes, for God's sake.

370
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,250

That seems excessive.

382
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,260
我管它好像什么呢
I didn't ask how it seems.

383

弹夹再检查一遍
Check those magazines, gentlemen.

384

We can't afford any misfires.

385
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,940
怎么样
Well?

386
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,040

420
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,570
他知道你要去吗
he got the message?

421
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,800
他会提前九十分钟到
He'll be there 90 minutes early.

422
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,260
记得要数数你看见了几头牛
Hey, make sure you count how many cows you see.

怎么回事  在告别吗
What was that? Good-bye?

428
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,330
-不是  -跟我保证你会来

429
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,510
因为我从未没见过你姐姐
Because I've never even spoken to your sister

430
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,390
如果你不来的话就太尴尬了
and it will be pretty goddamn awkward if you don't show--

431
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,310
我们三天以后见
I will see you in three days.

432
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,220
要不然我就去找你  把你抓到威斯康辛州
Or I will hunt you down and drag you to Wisconsin.

433
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,050
我保证
I promise.

434
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,470
有人吗
Hello?

435
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,510

在伤到人之前把那东西收起来

437
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,700
怎么他妈回事  人都在哪

-关门了  -为什么

439
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,270
能不能把那东西收起来
Would you put that away, please?

440
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,830
我要走了
I'm leaving town.

441
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,130
跟萨利去古巴

我办完事情就走
As soon as I finish what I need to do.

444

你打算什么时候告诉我
When were you gonna tell me?

445
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,140
我打算现在告诉你
I intended to tell you now.

446
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,020
我们还要开会
We have a meeting.

447
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,610
-马赫里亚  -没有会议

448
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,030
我知道是怎么回事了
I saw to that.

449
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,850
旅店登记了三个空房间
There are names on a hotel register with three empty rooms.

450
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,590
还有你和我

451
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,380
-努基  我  -努基  我什么

452
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,800
努基  我犯错了
Nucky, I made a mistake?

453
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,970
努基  对不起
Nucky, I'm sorry?

454
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,240
我说什么有什么关系
What's it matter what I say?

455
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,320
你能失去的东西很多
You have a lot to lose.

456
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,770
我吗  我一无所有
Me? I don't have anything.

457
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,990
早晚你都会夺走
Sooner or later you wind up taking it all.

458
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,680
我无能为力
Can't help it.

459
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,190
我准备好了
I'm ready.

460
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,610
你呢
Are you?

461
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,810
是你罪有应得
It's what you deserve.

462
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,990
-爸  -走开

463
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,060
-那是我儿子  -你在干什么

464
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,780
-他要杀了你  -不  不会
- He's gonna kill you.  - No, he's not.

465
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,790
他不会  他不会
He's-- he's not.

466
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,420
你跟他说
You tell him.

467
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,560
告诉他怎么回事
Tell him what's going on.

468
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,430
诺克斯
Knox.

469
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,930
你是对的  他不是禁酒探员
You had it right. He's no Prohee.

470
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,830
你那个同学  那个谋杀指控
The kid at school, that murder charge

471
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,020
你把检察官买通了  他知道了
you had the DA squash, he knows.

472
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,240
他知道
He knows.

473
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,930
他想要你  纽约和佛罗里达的人
He wants you and New York and Florida

474
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,700
坐在一起
all together all at once.

475
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,320
这是不让他
That's the price

476
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,930
进监狱的代价
to keep him out of jail.

477
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,830
- 爸  我  -你向着他
- Pop, I-- - So you go to him?

478
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,990
胳膊肘向外拐
Over your father?

479
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,200
我能收拾残局
I'm the one who can fix it.

480
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,440
他本来应该有所成就
He was supposed to amount to something.

481
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,680
他还是会的
He's still going to.

482
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:38,760
什么成就  成为一个在旅店里
What? A man in an empty hotel

483
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,200
拿枪指着他兄弟的男人
pointing a gun at his brother?

484
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,010
我是为了家人
I did it for the family.

485
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,520
你没有家人
You don't have a family.

486
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,270
我有
I do.

487
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,920
现在你也想拥有
Now you want that, too.

488
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,070
什么都无法填补你内心的空洞
Nothing will fill that hole you got inside.

489
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,150
你还不知道吗
Don't you know that yet?

490
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,970
这是你搞砸的  伊莱
This is your mess, Eli.

491
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,390
自己受着吧
Drown in it.

492
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,330
他们不会来了
They're not coming.

493
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,290
你说不准
You don't know that.

494
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,940
你被骗了  吉姆  直面现实吧
You've been duped, Jim. Let's face it.

495
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,510
你可高兴了  是吧
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

496
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,580
-什么  -能让你这一天很愉快吧
- What? - That would make your entire day.

497
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,590
让我们单独待一会儿  好吗
Give us a minute, will you?

498
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,450
你很生气  我理解
You're upset. I understand.

499
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,550
生气
Upset?

500
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,030
-生气  -冷静点
- Upset?! - Just calm down.

501
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,730
你以为我不知道吗  你  胡佛还有其他人
You think I don't know? You, Hoover and the others,

502
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,380
-这是个多大的笑话啊  -吉姆  我
- what a joke this has all been? - Jim, I--

503
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,550
你从未支持我  从来没有
You were never on board, never for a second.

504
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,570
我赌上了所有
I have put everything on the line!

505
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,400
我觉得你应该把你的枪给我
I think you should give me your sidearm.

506
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,050
什么
What?

507
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,150
你现在情绪不稳定
You are not keeping on an even keel.

508
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,570
你想要我的枪  哈罗德
You want my gun, Harold?

509
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,600
来拿啊
Why don't you take it?

510
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,670
他要见你
He's asking for you.

511
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,070
你醒着吗
You awake?

512
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,980
感觉怎么样
How you feeling?

513
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,950
我很好
I'm okay.

514
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,310
以前从未听你这样说过
I've never heard you say that before.

515
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,120
是吗啡的关系
Morphine.

516
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,470
放松好好享受吧
Well, relax and enjoy it.

517
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,790
我们有二十四小时的保镖和护士

你很快就会出院了
You'll be out of here in no time.

519
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,650
然后我们就会弄死那帮狗娘养的
And then we'll get them sons of bitches.

520
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:29,060
这是年轻人的游戏
This is a young man's game.

521
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,890
我不参与
I'm not gonna fight.

522
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,400
你想放走他们
You're gonna let them get away with it?

523
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,740
是你的  阿尔

526
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,660
天呐  强尼  你确定吗
Jesus, Johnny. Are you sure?

527
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,240
你赢了  孩子
You win, kid.

528
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,380
我不挡你路
I'm out of your way.

529
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,970
我该去欧洲养老了
It's Europe for me.

530
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,400

-伊莱  -他在这里

532
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,550
你得对我说实话
You need to be honest with me.

533
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,090
伊莱  你忘了我们有约吗
Eli. Did you forget we had an appointment?

534
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,810
没忘
No.

535
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,820

544
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,910
我之前告诉你会发生什么事儿  伊莱

548
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,390

和你儿子同龄
About your own son's age.

550
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,900
是真的童子军
A real Boy Scout type.

551
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,690
他偷车的时候被我抓了

你是在威胁一名联邦探员吗
Are you threatening a federal agent?

557
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,430
把手腕给我
Give me your wrist.

558
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,790
我的搭档  塞尔比探员  他觉得我疯了
My partner, Agent Selby, he thinks I'm crazy.

559

00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,870
你只是个无足轻重的小人物
You are just a peddler and a pimp

701
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:31,480
乖乖坐在监狱里
sitting in a jail cell.

702
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:38,060
我是个商人  也是个基督徒
I am a businessman and a follower of Christ.

703
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:41,550
你同意跟我们合作  你愿意当什么
You agree to cooperate, you can go on pretending

704
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:43,910
就继续当什么
to be anything you want.

705
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:49,040
不合作  我可以向你保证
You don't, and I will make sure

706
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,210
你再也见不到美利坚的阳光了
you never see daylight in America again.

707
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,790
我听不见
I cannot hear you.

708
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:18,770
我说  是
I said yes.

709
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,770
是  什么
Yes, what?

710
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:24,870
是
Yes...

711
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:28,680
先生
sir.

712
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,240
老妈要的一切都在这了
That's everything Ma asked for.

713
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:59,600
汤姆随后会去船上
Tom can run it up to Brigantine later.

714
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,530
除非你想去
Unless you want to do it.

715
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,870
我要在城里呆一会
I'm gonna stay in town for a little.

716
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:07,500
-不是想给你说教  -努基伯父  能不能
- Not trying to tell you-- - Uncle Nucky, can we just--

717
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,170
但是他们都靠你了
But they're counting on you--

718
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:12,880
你的母亲  兄弟  姊妹
your mother, brothers and sisters.

719
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,720
你现在说了算
You're in charge now.

720
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:17,330
明白吗
You understand?

721
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,240
我今晚出发
I'll drive up tonight.

722
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:23,850
这是正确的决定
That's the right decision.

723
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,480
我要怎么告诉他
What am I supposed to tell them?

724
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:31,980
说你父亲和朋友待在西部  很安全
That your father is safe with friends out west.

725
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,740
他们不知道具体地址最好
It's best they don't know where.

726
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:38,870
这对大家来说都很艰难  但也只能这样
It's hard on everyone, but that's how it has to be.

727
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,010
真的吗
Is he?

728
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:41,970
什么真的吗
Is he what?

729
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:43,670
他很安全
Safe.

730
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,170
说出你的想法  威尔
Speak your mind, Will.

731
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,690
如果我没出现  你会怎么做
If I hadn't shown up, what would you have done?

732
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:04,470
他是你的父亲  我的弟弟
He's your father, my brother.

733
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,110
我没有你想的心那么狠
And I'm not the person you think I am.

734
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,530
晚点来信天翁
Come by the Albatross later.

735
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,160
我们一起走
We'll both head up.

736
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,590
这样我们就能待在一起了
That way, all of us can be together, all right?

737
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,600
会越来越容易接受的  等着看吧
It gets easier. You'll see.
