沙子 默里 到处都是沙子!

总是和我配合完美
He always bringing it full tilt.

124
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,750
你看起来还是那么瘦
You're looking skinny, too.

125
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,630
现在只剩一个头了
Now that you're just a head.

126
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,090
好吧 我会找你算账的
Okay, you'll pay for that.

127
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,340
到底怎么回事 德库拉?
So what's up, Drac?

128
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,340
看样子旅馆正在重整旗鼓
The hotel is looking off the hook.

129
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,760
嘿 伙计们 看看这个
Hey, guys, watch this.

130
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,350
顺便说一下 你的这些发展方向都是可行的

131
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,480
哦 很好 不错
Oh, good, good.

132
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,150
我让底格里斯河(流经土耳其和伊拉克)与尼罗河通流
Yeah, I took the Tigris

133
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,110
这样就绝对无路可走了
through the Nile, and there was absolutely no traffic.

134
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,700
你这是在和我开玩笑
You're kidding me.

135
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,120
竟然在我的大厅放屁?
Right in my lobby?

136
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,950
德库拉 我发誓不是我 那不是我的放屁风格
Drac, I swear, man, I don't run like that.

137
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,450
客房服务!
Housekeeping!

138
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,920

I was not the cause of that.

139
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,260
都准备好啦!
We're ready!

140
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,680
要是玛莎能看见就好了
If only Martha were here to see this.

141
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,140
她从未离开过 旺达
She's always here, Wanda.

142
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,600
好了 朋友们
Okay, friends,

143
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,770
很高兴各位能亲临派对现场
I am so glad you are here to celebrate.

144
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,030
我的宝贝女儿梅维丝一年一度的生日盛会
Another birthday for my sweet little Mavis,

145
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,780
同时又是成功躲避人类的新一年!
and another successful year of refuge from them!

146
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,160
这些都是我们监控器拍摄到的
These are recent human images

147
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,410
最新的人类图片
our surveillance has uncovered.

148
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,750
他们变得越来越胖 为的是能更加压制我们
They are getting fatter so as to overpower us.

149
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,830
他们穿的衣服也越来越少
And they are wearing less clothing,

150
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,090
他们就更方便勒死我们
allowing more movement to strangle us

151
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,250
把我们的头砍下来装糖果
or cut open our heads and put candy in them.

152
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,840
但是现在他们永远都不会
But they will never

153
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,170
在这里找到我们了
find us here.

154
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,590
邪恶的坏人 你们不会得逞的!
Evil villain, you will never win!

155
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,350
乡亲们 30分钟后开始狂欢
Okie doke. The fun starts in 30 minutes.

156
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,520
现在我要去看下我的宝贝女儿了
Right now, I have to see my little girl.

157
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,430
她不再是小姑娘啦!
She's not so little anymore!

158
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,600
不 她就是!
Yes, she is!

159
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,440
发生什么事了?
What's going on out there?

160
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,110
我们已经到旅馆了吗?
Are we at the hotel?

161
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,280
弗兰克 你给我们预定了双人按摩吗?
Frank, did you book us for a tandem massage?

162
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,530
你为我们准备好了一张驼背桌子吗?
Did you get us a table at Hunchback's?

163
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,160
该做的都做到了吗?
Did you do anything?

164
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,620
不用客气
You're welcome.

165
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,700
搞什么情况?
What's going on?

166
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,450
老爹 你说过的
Dad, you said that

167
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,370
当我118岁的时候 我就能像其他大人一样
when I turned 118 I could go out into the world

168
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,380
自由出入这间旅馆 到外面的世界看看
like every other adult that gets to come and go from this hotel.

169
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,130
"但是 梅梅 外面不安全 叽叽哇哇 叽哇叽哇"
"But, Mavey Wavey, it's not safe. Bleh, bleh-bleh."

170
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,550
老爹 30年前你答应过我的
Dad, 30 years ago, you promised.

171
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,470
我一直记得 当时我们在吃老鼠
I remember, we were both eating mice,

172
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,970
你很明确的说你会兑现你的诺言的
and you specifically said that you gave me your word.

173
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,560
请勿打扰
Do not disturb.

174
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,890
- 请勿打扰  - 请勿打扰
- Do not disturb.  - Do not disturb.

175
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,060
请勿打扰
Do not disturb.

176
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,440
- 请勿打扰  - 请勿打扰
- Do not disturb.  - Do not disturb.

177
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,650
- 请勿打扰  - 早上好 阁下大人
- Do not disturb.  - Good morning, Your Eminence.

178
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,900
女佣 这间房需要打扫!
Maid, clean up this room!

179
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,740
你来啦 很高兴你能来
It's you. Glad you could make it.

180
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,990
- 她起来了吗?  - 哦 起来了
- Is she up yet?  - Oh, she's up.

181
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,740
她已经准备好出去了 出去看外面的世界
She's ready to go. And by "go," I mean go. As in, go check the world out.

182
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,750
你准备怎么做? 你准备怎么说?
What you gonna do? What you gonna say?

183
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,250
我已经安排好了 别紧张 做好本分的事
I got it covered. Please, relax. Just do your job.

184
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,250
早上好 梅梅!
Good morning, Mavey Wavey!

185
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,260
生日快乐 我的小老鼠!
Happy birthday, my little mouse!

186
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,510
谢谢你 老爹
Thank you, Dad.

187
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,260
我知道今天是我的生日
I know it's my birthday.

188
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,840
我为你安排了一大堆的娱乐活动 喔呵!
I have so much fun planned. Whoo-hoo!

189
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,760
但是 我们先一起去抓些蝎子
But first, we go catch some scorpions together,

190
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,600
就咱俩哦 怎么样?
just the two of us, yes, dead-ums?

191
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,770
老爹 等一下 让我说两句
Dad, please, let me speak.

192
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,520
有些事情我想和你谈谈
There's something we have to talk about.

193
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,020
你想去外面的世界 你可以去了
You want to go out into the world. You can.

194
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,190
啊!
Aha!

195
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,610
我就知道你会这样说
I knew you were gonna say that.

196
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,530
但是 老爹 你答应过我
But, Dad, you gave me your word,

197
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,110
而且你很清楚吸血鬼的话是神圣的
and you know that I know that a Dracula's word is sacred.

198
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,780
信任就是我们的...
That our trust is the core of our...

199
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,950
等下 你刚说什么?
Wait, what?

200
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,450
我说你可以去了
I said you can go.

201
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,780
你这是在耍我
You're just playing with me.

202
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,450
不是的 你已经到了能驾驶一辆灵车的年龄了
No, no, no, no. You're old enough to drive a hearse now,

203
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,540
你已经有能力做你自己的选择了
you're old enough to make your own choices.

204
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,870
你可以去了
You can go.

205
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,750
太棒了! 太棒啦!
Holy rabies! Holy rabies!

206
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,220
哇 等一下
Whoa, whoa. Stop.

207
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,140
稍微等一下 亲爱的小尖牙
Wait a second, sweet fangs.

208
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,550
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

209
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,560
哦 这个 我要去天堂
Oh, well, I'm going to paradise,

210
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,970
我觉得这些东西应该用得上
and this is just some stuff that I thought I would need.

211
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,310
- 天堂?  - 是的 你懂的
- Paradise?  - Yeah, you know.

212
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,980
就是你和妈妈相遇的地方
It's that place out there where you and Mom met.

213
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,310
旺达姨妈说
Auntie Wanda says you two

214
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,320
当时你俩一见钟情!
were just like, Zing!

215
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,980
我不知道什么"一见钟情"
I don't know from "Zing."

216
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,900
你在哪儿找到那张卡片的?
Where did you find that card?

217
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,490
在你的抽屉里
In one of your drawers.

218
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,410
你为什么从不告诉我你们是怎么相遇的呢?
Why won't you ever tell me about how you met?

219
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,990
其实那里是夏威夷
It's actually Hawaii.

220
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,160
夏什么夷?
Ha-what-what?

221
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,330
听着 亲爱的 我知道你很激动
Look, honey, I know you're excited,

222
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,000
但是现在所有人都是大老远跑来为你庆祝生日的
but everyone has gone to great lengths to come see you on your birthday.

223
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,590
我知道 他们每次都是
I know. They always do.

224
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,590
但我是不是已经不太适合参与这些活动了?
But aren't I getting a little old for these parties?

225
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,430
我爱他们 但是我真的很想接触些新的事物
I love them, but I really want to see new things.

226
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,590
或者认识一些年龄相仿的人
Maybe meet somebody my age.

227
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,350
好吧 不 别这样
Come on. No, no, don't do that.

228
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,930
不要可怜巴巴的样子
Don't give me the pouty bat face.

229
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,350
好吧 离墓地不远的地方
Okay, there is a human village

230
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,810
有一个人类的村子
just a little ways past the cemetery.

231
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,980
你可以去那里看看 然后差不多30分钟后就回来
You could go there and be back in, like, 30 minutes or so.

232
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,990
对于第一次出行30分钟已经足够了
It should be plenty for your first time.

233
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,950
好吧 虽然不是去什么夏威威
Well, it's not Ha-wee-wee, but I guess

234
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,660
但总算是能出去一回
it's still technically out there.

235
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,200
好了 好了 我知道了!
Okay, okay, okay!

236
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,750
非常感谢您这么相信我
Thanks for trusting me.

237
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,500
当然了 我的小乖乖
Of course, my little one.

238
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,550
我兑现了我的承诺
I gave you my word.

239
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,300
嘿 亲爱的!
Hey, honey!

240
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,970
- 看这里!  - 嘿 各位
- Look at this!  - Hey, guys.

241
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,930
你这是为明天的生日而兴奋吗?
You excited about tomorrow?

242
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,640
我现在有更兴奋的事
Not as excited as I am right now.

243
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,640
你们不会相信的 但是老爹终于允许我
You're not gonna believe this, but Dad is letting me

244
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,470
独自去外面看看人类的村子了!
go out on my own to see a human village!

245
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,600
- 什么?  - 不会吧!
- What?  - No!

246
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,770
请让一下 德库拉!
Excuse me. Drac!

247
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,980
你疯了吗?
Have you lost it?

248
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,650
你常对我们说外面的人类很恐怖
Letting your own daughter out there

249
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,230
但现在你却让你自己的女儿去冒险?
with those horrible humans you always tell us about?

250
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,400
你忘了建造旅馆的原因了吗
That's why you built this place.

251
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,450
人类讨厌我们 人类都是邪恶的
They hate us. They're vicious.

252
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,360
而且他们说话很吵闹!
And they're very loud!

253
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,780
尤妮斯姨妈 也许那些人类现在变了
Auntie Eunice, maybe they've changed.

254
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,540
我只是想飞到街上看看真实的现状
I'm just gonna fly down the street and see how it goes.

255
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,500
好吧 亲爱的 注意安全
Okay, honey, be safe.

256
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,460
多穿点别着凉 要带上魔剑
Bring warm clothes and a sword.

257
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,790
要小心干草叉子
And look out for pitchforks.

258
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,130
同样要小心不能让任何人把你的脑子铲出来
Don't you let anyone scoop your brains out, either.

259
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,460
也许待在阴暗处比较好
Maybe stay in the shadows.

260
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,880
在屋檐下静静的观察会更有趣的
It's more fun to just observe from under a house.

261
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,760
好了 伙计们 她能处理好一切的
Guys, guys. She can handle it.

262
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,050
看在上帝的份上 她可是一个吸血鬼
She's a Dracula, for Pete's sake.

263
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,470
但值得注意的是 小心火烛
But seriously, watch out for fire.

264
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,430
玩火者自焚
Fire bad.

265
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,860
再见了 各位
Bye, everyone.

266
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,440
喔啊!
Whoo-hoo!

267
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,540
喔啊!
Whoo-hoo!

268
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,750
德库拉 我不敢相信你能如此冷静地看着她离开
Drac, I can't believe how calm you are about her leaving.

269
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,250
真为你骄傲
I'm proud of you.

270
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,550
德库拉? 你在哪儿?
Drac? Drac?

271
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,460
德库拉去哪儿了?
Where did Drac go?

272
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,470
喔啊!
Whoo-hoo!

273
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,560
太了不起了!
This is awesome!

274
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,890
这里有一个墓地 和老爹说的一样
There's the cemetery, just like Dad said.

275
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,200
喔啊!
Whoo-hoo!

276
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
呃... 有人吗?
Uh... Hello?

277
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,100
有人在吗?
Anybody out there?

278
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,820
- 吸血鬼  - 啃脚趾!
- Vampire.  - Bite toes!

279
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,990
哦!
Oh!

280
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,700
嗨 各位
Hi, humans.

281
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:59,160
大家都好吗? 我叫梅维丝・德库拉 我是...
Everything okay? My name is Mavis Dracula, and I...

282
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,500
吸血鬼
Vampire.

283
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,290
- 烧掉衣服  - 要烧掉我的衣服?
- Burn clothes.  - Burn my clothes?

284
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,500
- 真的吗? 呃...  - 吸血鬼!
- Really? Um...  - Vampire!

285
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,130
- 我们来拿你的糖果  - 糖果!

286
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,590
我很友好的 真的
I'm friendly. I really am.

287
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
- 冷静点  - 糖果
- Calm down, now.  - Candy.

288
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,890
我只是想跟大家打声招呼
I just wanted to say hi.

289
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,280
别这样 我从未伤害过任何人
Please. I've never hurt anyone.

290
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,410
我是一个宅女
I'm homeschooled.

291
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,540
那是蒜油味的吗?
Is that garlic?

292
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,840
我的乖乖 你们着火了
Holy rabies, you're on fire.

293
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,800
有什么需要帮忙的吗? 要我帮你们吗?
Can I do anything? Can I help you?

294
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,430
老爹说的没错
Dad was right.

295
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,430
老爹说的没错
Dad was right.

296
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,150
成功了
It worked.

297
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,400
现在我的宝贝女儿永远都安全了
Now my baby will be safe forever.

298
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,080
好了 各位 都回去工作了
All right, everybody, get back to work now.

299
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,580
嘿 你不能把模特带走
Hey. You don't need a mannequin.

300
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,630
把模特放下 快点
Leave the mannequin here. Come on.

301
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,230
你去哪儿了?
Where you been?

302
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,150
为啥鬼鬼祟祟的到处跑?
Why you sneaking around?

303
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,400
嘘 闭嘴
Shh. Quiet.

304
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,240
宝贝 你这么快就回来了?
Sweetheart, have you returned so soon?

305
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,570
哦 进来吧 老爹
Oh. Come in, Dad.

306
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,580
感觉如何? 外面的世界怎么样?
How'd it go? How was the big world?

307
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,290
有没有什么新发现?
How was it out there?

308
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,620
还好啦 老爹
It was okay, Dad.

309
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,290
怎么了? 说说又何妨呢?
What? What's the matter?

310
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,130
老爹 你说的没错
Dad, you were right.

311
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,670
那些人类很可怕
Humans are awful.

312
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,500
和你说的完全一样
They were everything you said.

313
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,800
- 他们要啃我的脚趾  - 你的脚趾?
- They wanted to bite my toes.  - Your toes?

314
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,920
他们还把大蒜汁浇在面包上
And they had garlic on bread.

315
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,970
什么? 看看我吧
What? Look at me.

316
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,560
我浑身都起鸡皮疙瘩了 吓死我了
I'm getting goose bumps, I'm so scared.

317
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,640
很抱歉 宝贝
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

318
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,270
我难过让你看到事实
I hate that you had to see that.

319
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,860
很抱歉我不相信你的话
I'm so sorry I doubted you.

320
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,240
我再也不离开这里了
I'll never leave here again.

321
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,610
好了 没事了
Okay. Okay.

322
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,370
听着 老爹我将要为你举办一场最好的生日宴会
Look, Daddy's going to make you the bestest birthday ever.

323
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,790
看看我给你带什么来了
Look what I brought you.

324
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,710
你最爱的虫虫蛋糕
Your worm cakes.

325
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,960
不要再难过了
Don't be sad anymore.

326
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,550
还记得吧 今年我们将要打开妈妈给你留着的礼物
Remember, this is the year we open Mommy's present for you.

327
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,210
她给我准备什么了?
What did she get me?

328
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,470
拭目以待哦
We'll see.

329
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:02,720
她说了只有你到了118岁的时候才能打开
She said never to open until you're 118.

330
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,680
我们为此等了很久很久哦
We've waited this long.

331
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,060
先吃着你的虫虫蛋糕吧
You eat your worm cakes.

332
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,190
等你准备好了就下来 亲爱的
You come down whenever you're ready, honey.

333
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,150
- 啊  - 哦
- Phew.  - Ooh.

334
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,440
你做了什么啊?
What did you do?

335
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,610
不得不做的事
What I had to.

336
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,820
嗯嗯
Mm-hmm.

337
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,490
她总有一天会感激我的
She'll thank me one day.

338
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,070
是的 这是把我头绑起来的那个人说的
Yeah, that's what the guy who shrunk my head said.

339
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,210
啊
Ahh.

340
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,590
你想要什么 饼干吗?
Yes, what do you want, a cookie?

341
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,840
你做的很好 老兄
You did all right, man.

342
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,170
继续向前走
Move on already.

343
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,890
啊!
Phew!

344
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,180
太好了
Yeah.

345
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,680
吸血鬼! 吸血鬼!
Vampire! Vampire!

346
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,100
一个人类
A human.

347
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,110
你是谁? 你是怎么找到这个地方的?
Who are you? And how did you find this place?

348
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,570
哦 我叫乔纳森
Oh, I'm Jonathan.

349
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,530
我只是和一群兄弟在爬山...
And I was just mountain climbing with some dudes...

350
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,240
然后听到一个关于幽魂森林的传说
and heard this story about a spooky forest.

351
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,870
任何人都想进入一个幽魂森林的 不是吗?
And who's not going to go into a spooky forest, right?

352
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,380
后来 我看到了那些着火的傻头傻脑的家伙
So, then I see these goofy-looking dudes on fire.

353
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:21,920
然后我就一路跟着他们来到了这里 一座不可思议的城堡
And I just kind of followed them to this, like, amazing castle.

354
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,300
当然了 放聪明点的话
But, of course, be smart.

355
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,390
不能有篝火 不能有烟火表演
No bonfires, no firework shows.

356
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,100
- 你们来了多少人?  - 就我一个
- How many of you are there?  - Just me.

357
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,481
我就是个独行侠
I like to hit it alone.

358
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,650
在青年旅舍可以碰到好多牛人
You meet so many awesome people in the youth hostels.

359
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,612
说道牛气 这件斗篷简直酷爆了
Hey, speaking of awesome, that cape thing is killing it.

360
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,448
这里是在开化妆舞会吗?
Is there, like, a costume party here?

361
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:41,657
我做了什么?
What have I done?

362
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,409
这都是我的错
This is all my fault.

363
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,327
你得走
You have to leave.

364
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,455
- 哦 糟糕  - 打扰您一下
- Oh, no.  - Excuse me.

365
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,166
在你河里有条食人鲳太放肆了
One of your piranhas in the lake is very rude.

366
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,792
把我的小姨子给吞了
He ate my sister-in-law.

367
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,294
您稍等下
Be right with you.

368
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,006
德库拉先生 我们要看得到游泳池的房间
Mr. Dracula, we asked for a room with a view of the pool.

369
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,966
房间不错 我们想预约个按摩
The room's fine. We want to book a massage.

370
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,217
- 对 要瑞士式按摩  - 日式的
- Yes, Swedish.  - Shiatsu.

371
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,635
- 要涂香料  - 还要照顾到下背
- Aromatherapy.  - Lower back.

372
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,845
- 你们有热石按摩吗?  - 我们来次按摩
- Do you have hot-stone?  - We want a massage.

373
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,597
- 我去去就回 六头怪先生  - 但愿
- I'll get back to you, Mr. Hydraberg.  - I hope so.

374
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,015
- 强烈怀疑  - 说话算话哦
- I doubt it.  - See that you do.

375
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,892
- 是六头怪女士啦  - 谢谢了
- That's Ms. Hydraberg.  - Thanks.

376
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,852
- 很高兴见到你  - 老哥 说真的 到底怎么了?
- Yes, nice to see you.  - Dude, seriously, what's up?

377
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,604
这下面有股怪味
It's kind of funky to breathe under here.

378
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,315
德库拉 嘿 梅维丝怎么样了?
Drac. Hey, Drac. How'd it go with Mavey?

379
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,692
你要去哪?
Hey. Where'd you go?

380
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,279
哇!
Wow!

381
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,281
这城堡这么大 房间却有点小
This room's kind of small for a big castle.

382
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,242
没床 不过这里摆着的簸箕真是酷啊
No bed, but check out these awesome dustpans they give you.

383
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,744
安静 傻帽
Quiet, you fool.

384
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,996
你在这个包里藏了什么凶器?
What weapons are you keeping in this container?

385
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,664
干草叉子?
Your pitchforks?

386
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,333
哦!
Oh!

387
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,918
我喘不上气了
I can't breathe.

388
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,503
我要死了
It's killing me.

389
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,130
对啊 臭袜子能杀人啊
Yeah, definitely due for a fluff and fold.

390
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,465
这又是啥?
What is this?

391
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,800
刑具?
A torture device?

392
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,551
精神控制仪?
A secret mind controller?

393
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,470
休想窥看我的想法
You won't read my thoughts.

394
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,763
我不会让你得逞
l won't let you.

395
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,431
老哥 这就是用来听音乐的
Dude, it's just music.

396
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:48,808
来试试看嘛
Here, try it.

397
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,810
哦!
Ohh!

398
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,772
它摄走了我的灵魂
It's taking my soul!

399
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,901
啥? 这歌的节奏不错 开放点嘛
What? It's a good jam. Don't be a grandpa.

400
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,486
你得给我走
You need to go.

401
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:05,449
没有人类踏入过这座城堡 如果谁看到了你
No human has ever entered this castle. And if someone should see you,

402
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:11,497
城堡就危险了 没人会再到这来 没人会再把它当成避难所
the safety of the hotel, the sanctuary, no one would ever come again.

403
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,541
好耶 在说一次
Yeah, go for it.

404
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,584
"没人会再来！"
"Ever come again!"

405
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:19,046
我超爱你的德库拉腔 简直碉堡了
l love your Dracula voice. It's so over the top.

406
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:23,759
还有梅维丝 如果她看到了你 她就会发现我骗了她 不要啊!
And Mavis, if she saw you, she would know that I lied. No!

407
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,719
梅维丝是谁? 这是她的房间吗?
Who's Mavis? Is this her room?

408
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:26,887
多一个室友也没什么
I'm good with a roommate.

409
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,056
我家里有六个兄弟 分享对我来说完全没问题
l had six brothers growing up, so I could totally share.

410
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,266
我不能宰了他
I can't kill him.

411
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,518
这会让怪物的操行倒退好几年
It would set monsters back hundreds of years.

412
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,270
有次 我在汉堡和个老兄睡一间屋子
One time, in Hamburg, I roomed with this dude

413
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,854
结果我发现他偷我的洗发水
who I caught stealing my shampoo.

414
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:39,191
我叫了声"哇 没搞错吧" 然后他就朝我丢花瓶 不过他挺酷的
I said, "Whoa, man," and he threw a flower pot at me, but he was cool.

415
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,651
你唧唧歪歪的说什么?
What are you babbling about?

416
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,236
啥? 哇
What? Whoa.

417
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,029
看看这些酷炫的道具服
Check out these awesome costumes.

418
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,698
道具服
Costumes.

419
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,535
做什么呢? 对不起老兄 我没了背包可不行
What's this? Sorry, man. I just can't be without my backpack.

420
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,162
- 你知道的 我的家当都在里面呢  - 我们就把它放在这
- You know, everything I own's in there.  - It'll be right here.

421
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,832
好啦 只是... 我爱自己的包
Okay, I just... I love my backpack.

422
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,417
哇 嘿 你干什么?
Whoa. Hey, what are you doing?

423
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,502
手往哪放呢... 你对我的头发做了什么?
What are you... What are you doing to my hair?

424
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,046
快住手 等下 好痒
Stop. Oh, wait, that tickles.

425
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,340
别玩了 老兄
Come on, man.

426
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,013
看我 我是个居家版的科学怪人
Check it out. I'm a Franken-homie.

427
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,889
- 对 好啊  - 看我这里!
- Yes, hello.  - Look at me!

428
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:14,977
这完全正常 什么事情没有 我只不过带了个怪物
This is totally normal, not a problem here. This is just a monster with me.

429
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,687
老兄 今天大家都盛装打扮啊
Man, everybody stepped it up tonight.

430
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,524
等下 为什么往大门走? 我们要走了吗?
Wait, why are we going to the front door? Are we leaving?

431
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,693
你好啊 德库拉
Bonjour, Dracula!

432
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,528
嘿 长鼻子 什么事啊?
Hey, Sniffy. What's going on?

433
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,447
现在没空 卡西莫多
Not right now, Quasimodo.

434
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,075
什么?
What?

435
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,202
说什么傻话呢
No. Don't be absurd.

436
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:35,080
这不是人类 是德库拉先生
It's not a human, but Mr.Dracula

437
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,207
真是荒谬 是我啊
How ridiculous. It's me.

438
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,628
先生
Monsieur.

439
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,339
- 这是芥末蜥蜴指  - 芥末蜥蜴指?
- The devilled lizard fingers.  - Devilled lizard fingers?

440
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,132
我要的是脾脏卷啊
I asked for spleens-in-blankets.

441
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,259
大白痴! 我告诉过你 他不喜欢
You ugly fool! I told you, he doesn't like

442
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,844
- 蜥蜴指头!  - 但是你说...
- the lizard fingers!  - But you said...

443
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,223
哇 看看那套打扮
Whoa. Check that costume out.

444
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:57,645
我得问问你 怎么才能出这种效果?
Wow. Seriously, I just have to ask you: How are you pulling this off?

445
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,229
我说 看起来好真啊
I mean, it looks so real.

446
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,565
就像是 可以把手伸进去...
Like, I could just put my hand right through...

447
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,610
你在干什么呢?
What do you think you're doing?

448
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,780
她是真的 你也是真的!
She's real. You're real!

449
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,617
没错 我的拳头也是真真的 离我老婆远点
Yeah, and I'll give you a real beating. Keep your hands out of my wife!

450
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,164
哦 惨了
Oh, no.

451
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,538
宝贝 我刚才不知道你去哪了
Honey, I just didn't know where you were.

452
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,623
我们以为你还在外面
We thought you were still out.

453
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:02,292
哦 我不知道自己为什么会想出门
Oh, no. I don't know why I eve rwanted to leave.

454
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,294
人类好无聊
The humans are so boring.

455
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,560
梅维丝宝贝 你没事吧?
Mavis, honey, are you all right?

456
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,730
我想没事 那感觉真怪
Yeah, I think so. That was weird.

457
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,732
头好疼啊
My head hurts.

458
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,734
- 嗯 那个人是谁?  - 什么谁?
- Um, who is that?  - Who is what?

459
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,402
哦 那个啊
Oh, that.

460
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,404
哪有什么人
That is nobody.

461
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,281
- 还没玩够呢 老爸?  - "老爸"
- Seriously, Dad?  - "Dad"?

462
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,160
对 我知道德库拉的闺女 大家第一次听说都会吓到
Yeah, I know, Dracula's daughter. Everyone freaks out at first.

463
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,411
还德库拉?
Dracula?

464
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,579
好吧 我们得走了
Okay, we got to go.

465
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,251
不要杀我 我还年少
Please don't kill me. I'm so young.

466
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,670
还有很多地方想见识
I have so many places I want to see.

467
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,006
我还要去戴夫・马休斯乐队的演唱会
I've got tickets to six Dave Matthews Band concerts.

468
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,966
我要从这里出去
I'm getting out of here.

469
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,637
给我闭嘴
Shut up already.

470
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,265
你吵成这样 我想不了问题
It's impossible for me to think with all your noise.

471
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,559
对不起 格林 回去睡吧
Sorry, Glen. Go back to sleep.

472
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:06,774
- 等等 你不吸我的血吗?  - 典型的人类偏见
- Wait. Aren't you going to suck my blood?  - Classic human paranoia.

473
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,819
人血脂肪太多 而且你还不知道那人都干过什么
Human blood is so fatty, and you never know where it's been.

474
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,655
所以德库拉不吸血?
So, Dracula doesn't drink blood?

475
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,158
我用其他东西代替血
No, I use a blood substitute.

476
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:20,537
血浆啊还有和血差不多的东西 都喝不出什么不同
Either Near Blood or Blood Beaters. You can't tell the difference.

477
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:23,457
所以 你就是 货真价实的德库拉
So, wow, you're, like, the real Count Dracula.

478
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,293
像是"我是德库拉 吧啦吧吧啦"
Like, "I'm Dracula. Bleh, bleh-bleh."

479
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:30,005
我活到现在还没说过一次"吧啦吧吧啦"
I've never said that in my life. "Bleh, bleh-bleh."

480
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,799
都不知道这说法哪里来的
I don't know where that comes from.

481
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:35,302
我能问问这到底是哪吗?
Can I just ask, what exactly is this place?

482
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,805
这里是哪?
What is this place?

483
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,729
这是我为了所有怪物建造的地方
It's a place I built for all those monsters out there,

484
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:51,151
他们在黑暗中游荡 躲避人类的迫害
lurking in the shadows, hiding from the persecution of humankind.

485
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,739
在这里 他们能和自己的家人一起回归自我
A place for them and their families to come to and be themselves.

486
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:59,243
这里没有火把 干草叉子 和愤怒的人群
A place void of torches, pitchforks, angry mobs.

487
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,579
只有平合和舒适
A place of peace, relaxation

488
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,915
还有宁静
and tranquility.

489
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,084
酷啊 所以这就是给怪物开的旅馆?
Cool. So, it's like a hotel for monsters?

490
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:12,047
对 没错 "给怪物开的旅馆" 总结的好
Yes, exactly. "A hotel for monsters." Way to sum it up.

491
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:16,552
好了 跳到我背上来 得走了
Okay, hop on my back. We're leaving.

492
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,262
哦 老兄 你变成蝙蝠了
Oh, man, you're a bat now.

493
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,222
我真的很想飞呢 感觉怎么样?
l always wanted to fly. What's it like?

494
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,433
这太疯狂了 等等 我不要走
This is insane. Wait. Wait, I want to stay.

495
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,061
能让科学怪人给我的衣服签名吗? 能让我见见隐形人吗?
Can Frankenstein sign my costume? Can I meet the lnvisible Man?

496
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,605
嘿 如果我把手伸到隐形人嘴里
Hey, if I stuck my hand in the lnvisible Man's mouth,

497
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,274
- 会怎么样?  - 嗨
- would it disappear?  - Hi.

498
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,236
梅梅! 你干什么来了 我的小血橙?
Mavey! What are you doing, my sweet little blood orange?

499
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,363
我们的朋友正要走呢
Our friend was just leaving.

500
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,407
对 他拉着我从窗户飞出来
Yeah, he was flying me out the window.

501
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,034
这家伙 他真是搞笑
This guy, he's so funny.

502
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,579
看那 你脸上沾了点东西
Look, you have something on your face.

503
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,416
想要再见到你的宝贝背包就好好配合
Play along if you ever want to see your precious backpack.

504
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:54,047
哇 等等 你在蝙蝠形态时没有衣服?
Whoa. So, wait, you didn't have any clothes on when you were a bat?

505
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,424
还是 它们就是蝙蝠形的?
Or were they bat-sized?

506
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,634
这到底是谁?
Who exactly is that?

507
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,970
嗯 我的小蝙蝠
Hmm. Honeybat.

508
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,264
你看 今天是你生日
You see, it's your birthday.

509
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:07,144
你知道 我想给你办场 人生最精彩最好的派对
And you know I want you to have the bestest, specialest party of your life.

510
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,522
嗯 所以我需要个帮手
So, well, I needed some help.

511
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,815
你需要帮手?
You needed help?

512
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,319
听着 我可能干了 但是我想
Well, look, I am very good, but I thought it would be

513
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:20,782
如果找个跟你差不多的人来帮我安排 那就会更特别 更好的
even more bestest, specialest if someone closer to your age helped plan the party.

514
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,117
- 你跟我差不多大?  - 当然了
- You're my age?  - Sure.

515
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,827
你多大?
Well, how old are you?

516
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:24,995
118岁
118.

517
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,872
一百...
One hundred and...

518
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,750
对 我121了
Yeah, I'm 121.

519
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,627
- 真的?  - 对啊
- Really?  - Mm-hmm.

520
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,464
看到没? 一切正常 超正常
You see? Everything is very, very normal.

521
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,300
我办派对 他来帮忙
I'm throwing a party, and he's helping.

522
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,677
- 先生 有紧急情况  - 现在没空
- Sir, there's an emergency.  - Not now.

523
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:44,348
看不出来我们现在正在做一件超级正常的事吗?
Can't you see we're in the middle of something very normal here?

524
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,974
等等 出了什么事了?
Wait, what's going on here?

525
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:50,312
你的宝贝饭店里面有紧急情况 你却不去处理?
There's an emergency in your precious hotel, and you're not running to fix it?

526
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,980
为什么不去? 因为他?
Why? Is it because of him?

527
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,899
哇 看着我
Whoa, look at my face.

528
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,986
不是 心肝宝贝 不是因为他
No, precious bones, it's not because of him.

529
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,906
好啊 去看看有什么紧急情况 我来陪他
Good. Then go check on the emergency, and I'll keep him company.

530
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,909
- 不行! 这事绝对不行!  - 什么?
- No! Anything but that!  - What?

531
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,703
我是说 他得做计划呢
I mean, because he needs time to plan.

532
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:09,665
如果你陪着他 他就计划不了了
And if you're keeping him company, then he's not planning.

533
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,541
如果有人陪着他
He is company-keeping,

534
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,002
然后 计划 这... 计划就没人去计划了
and then the plan, it's... It doesn't get planned.

535
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,421
- 嗯 编的好  - 闭嘴!
- Mm-hmm. Good one.  - Shut up!

536
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:20,592
好吧 等你之后不做计划了 我们就能一起打混了
Okay. So, maybe if you're not planning later, we can hang out.

537
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,220
- 听着挺好  - 对你听到了吗?
- Sounds good.  - Yes. You hear that?

538
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,055
听起来不错
It sounds good.

539
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:29,184
你们等下再一起玩 再见了 小心肝 小宝贝
So you will hang out. See you later, my honey. Lovely.

540
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,645
好了 你们不能一起
Okay, you're not hanging out.

541
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,647
因为你要走了
Because you are leaving.

542
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,774
但是 你不是说
But the opposite, you said.

543
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,113
先生 还有紧急情况呢
But, sir, the emergency.

544
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,739
跟上来
Follow me.

545
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,371
娘诶 这小子好臭
Boy, that kid smelt.

546
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,835
我们这是去哪?
Where are we going?

547
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,294
从密道把你送走
Just getting rid of you

548
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:59,131
这样她就看不见我们了
through a secret tunnel so she does not see us.

549
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,550
我可以问你个问题吗?
So, can I ask you a question?

550
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,969
所以 你们怕洋葱是真的吗?
Is that real, about the garlic thing?

551
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,888
对 我不能吃 喉咙会肿
Yes, I cannot have it. My throat swells.

552
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,807
嗯 用木桩穿心你会死吗?
Huh. Wooden stake to the heart?

553
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,559
木桩穿心谁死不了啊?
Yeah, well, who wouldn't that kill?

554
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,112
好了 就是这里了
Ah. Here we go.

555
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,743
哦 对不起 我有点迷路了
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a little lost.

556
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,329
我知道你们在度蜜月呢 对不起
Yes, I know it's your honeymoon. I apologize.

557
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,290
你们该干什么就继续把
Go back to doing what you were doing.

558
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,212
我不常下来这里
I'm not down here much.

559
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:42,883
这本来是人类入侵时 用来撤退的
It's meant to be an exit if humans ever invade.

560
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,762
所以 我是第一个来这里的人类? 这真酷
So, I'm, like, the first human here, huh? That's really cool.

561
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,264
哦 总算找到了
Oh, boy.

562
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,349
我想就是这儿了
I think this is it.

563
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,021
- 出什么事了?  - 实在是抱歉
- What's happening?  - I'm terribly sorry.

564
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,523
- 这是我的错  - 你们这些人有什么毛病啊?
- My mistake.  - What is wrong with you people?

565
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,487
哦 老兄 这地方太棒了
Oh, man. This place is amazing.

566
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,198
好吧 让我耳根清净一会儿
Okay, I could really use some silence right now.

567
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,082
好的 坏事不过三...
All right, third time's a...

568
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,423
德库拉
Drac.

569
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,300
哦 弗兰基?
Yes, Frankie?

570
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,676
嘿 兄弟 你都在忙什么呢?
Hey, buddy, what you been doing?

571
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,969
别动
Don't move.

572
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,805
别管这个 你都在干嘛呢?
Never mind that. What you been doing?

573
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,808
我们想排练 为梅维丝的派对准备的大节目
We wanted to practice our big number for Mavis's party,

574
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,976
这些怂货就是不从台上下来
and then these losers wouldn't get off the bandstand.

575
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,728
把僵尸莫扎特放下
Okay. Put down Zombie Mozart,

576
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,397
还有巴赫和贝多芬 马上
Bach and Beethoven this instant.

577
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,946
你还用得着排练吗 僵尸贝多芬?
Did you get to rehearse at all, Zombie Beethoven?

578
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:51,576
听着 德库拉 我们想练一支曲子 像以前那样练
Listen, Drac, we wanted to play something, like old times.

579
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,079
我们还想你加入
We even thought maybe you'd sing with us.

580
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:58,458
算了把 老弟 你知道自从玛莎出事后我就不在公开场合唱歌了
Come on, fellas. You know that I haven't sung in public since Martha.

581
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,794
但是 我们只是觉得 梅维丝会期待你的表演
Yeah, but we just thought how much, you know, Mavis would love it.

582
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:01,962
我说了不要!
I said no!

583
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,171
别再问了!
Don't ask me again!

584
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,800
好了 现在和僵尸们抱一抱 大家言归与好
Okay. Now, let's hug the zombies. Let's all make up.

585
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,428
- 哇 他真的把你唬住了  - 才没有
- Wow. He really scared you.  - I wasn't scared.

586
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,471
我只是有礼貌 好嘛?
I was being polite, okay?

587
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,683
嘿 你在这里干嘛呢? 我还以为你在做计划呢
Hey. What are you doing here? I thought you were planning.

588
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,185
我还不知道你的名字
I never caught your name.

589
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,353
我叫梅维丝
My name's Mavis.

590
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,106
梅维丝? 这名字真好听
Mavis? That's a pretty neat name.

591
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,858
对我妈妈取的
Yeah, my mom picked it.

592
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,111
所以 你要告诉你的名字吗?
So, are you going to tell me your name?

593
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:30,198
我? 我叫什么? 问得好
Me? My name? Good question.

594
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,200
明显 我叫科学怪人
Well, obviously, I'm Frankenstein.

595
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,828
你才不是 科学怪人是我舅舅 他就在那
No, you're not. Frankenstein is my uncle over there.

596

那个抱着僵尸莫扎特的先生
The gentleman hugging Zombie Mozart.

597
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,584
哦 对了 他当然是你舅舅了

598
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,795
听着 我不是科学怪人本人
Well, see, I'm not "the" Frankenstein.

599
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:47,507
我是他的表亲科学约翰尼

这些怪物要杀我吗?
Are these monsters going to kill me?

603
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,019
只要他们以为你是怪物 你就没事
Not as long as they think you're a monster.

604
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,520
嗯? 这有点种族歧视啊
Huh? That's kind of racist.

605
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,063
等下讨论
We'll talk later.

606
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,069
- 他是在拿我开涮吗?  - 没有的事
- Is he making fun of me?  - No, no.

607

跟你的右手有血缘关系
On your right arm's side.

613

我的手有亲戚?
You have a cousin?

614
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,043
弗兰克 如果你的手能说话
Frank, if your arm could talk,

615
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,171
它就会告诉你 它本来的拥有者 有一个弟弟

620

我该在说话前 提示性地咳一声
I should really clear my throat before I speak.

624
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,606

So, anyways, we thought we could liven things up a bit.

I stink at this.

是啊 夏天他们总是特别猖獗
Yeah, it does get pretty crazy in the summer.

710
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,646
不过也就跟着混呗

放心吧 没人怀疑我
Relax. No one suspects anything.

723
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:05,635
如果他们觉得奇怪 也是因为你总偷偷摸摸的
The only thing that looks weird is how much whispering you're doing.

724
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,974
该结束了 说你要去游泳然后装得激动点
Just wrap it up. You will say you are going in the pool and act excited.

725
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,519
然后就说你拉伤了背要提前走
And then you will say you hurt your back and you have to leave.

726

各位 别再闹了!
Everyone, stop the roughhousing!

738
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,511

Whoo!

739
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,893
弗兰克 如果你伤到了...
Frank, if you hurt yourself...

740
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,478
明白了 亲爱的
I got it, honey.

741
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,315
科学怪人家的男人就是为这而生的
The Stein boys are bred for this kind of thing.

742

744
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,997
孩子们 怎么能这么做?
Kids, why'd you do that?

745
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,749
我刚刚去游了泳
I was just in the pool.

746
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:18,916
水真凉啊
The water's cold.

747
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,418
不许笑我!
Don't judge me!

748
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,796
约翰尼 你的妆

00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,472
我猜伯爵也想游泳了
l guess the Count wanted to go for a swim.

753
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:47,987
水弹!
Cannonball!

754
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,349

Oh, you messed up, baby. You messed up big time.

755

我告诉过你要低调
l told you to take it down.

756
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,353
如果他们发现 我的旅店就毁了
You'll ruin my hotel if they find out.

757
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,604
也许你只是嫉妒
Well, maybe you're just jealous

758
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,439
大家在这里终于能找点乐子了
that people are finally having fun at this place.

759
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:26,109
乐子? 那不叫乐子
Oh, that? That was not fun.

760
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:29,320
每个人乱七八糟地 又跑又跳又游泳
Everyone running, jumping, swimming with no order.

761
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:30,822
那一点也不像在找乐子
That was the opposite of fun.

762
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,657
你知道什么是乐子吗?
Do you even know what fun is?

763
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,117
乐子可是老子发明的!
l invented fun!

764
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,411
哎 就你也配长生不老

Look at me.

766
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:43,793
忘掉我们曾经见面
You remember nothing of this encounter.

767
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:49,549
忘掉这个地方和你见过的怪物
You have no memory of this place or the monsters you met.

768
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,844
现在离开 永远别回来
Now go and never return.

769
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,389
等等 永远不能回旅店?
Wait, never return to the hotel?

770
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,683
哪尼? 你应该忘掉这个旅店的
What? You were supposed to forget the hotel.

771
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,977
我明明用超能力抹去了你的记忆
l just used my powers to erase your memory.

772
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,645
我盯着你的眼睛看的
l looked straight into your eyes.

773
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:04,647
呃 哦 可能是因为隐形眼镜
Huh. Oh, maybe it's the contact lenses.

774
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,816
- 隐形什么?  - 这些小塑料做的便宜货
- The what?  - These little plasticky doodads

775
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,025
能让我看清楚点
that help me see better.

776
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,153
等等 我把他们拿出来 很快
Here, let me just try and get them out real quick.

777
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,947
哦 这是我见过的最恶心的动作!
Oh, that is the most disgusting thing l've ever seen!

778
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,992
- 就好了  - 住手 拜托了 住手!
- Almost got it.  - Stop doing that. Please stop doing that!

779
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,661
把手指从眼球上拿开! 够了!
Fingers away from the eyeballs! Enough!

780
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,624
听着 你永远都不能再回来
Listen to me. You are never to return here.

781
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:27,587
你要离这里远远的 也别把这里的事告诉人类
You are to stay away and never tell humans about this place.

782
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:32,216
不然我会找到你 吸干你
Or I will track you down and suck every ounce of blood

783
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,804
体内的每一滴血 直到你看起来像个泄气的坐垫!
from your body until you look like a deflated whoopee cushion!

784
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,808
去吧
Be gone.

785
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,442
竟然把我踢走 本来玩得挺好的
Can't believe I'm leaving, man. That could have been so great!

786
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,487
那家伙把一切都毁了 想吸我的血
Dude ruined everything. Suck my blood.

787
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,281
我应该说 "我就要留下 老头!"
I should have just said, "I'm staying, old man!"

788
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:58,451
像李小龙一样给他一脚 蹦! 对着他的...
Give him a Bruce Lee kick. Boom! Right in the...

789
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,913

Oh, my God. Count Dracula. Please don't kill me. I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,756
- 真的? 很好玩哦  - 好吧
- You sure? It'll be fun.  - Okay.

792
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,519
他不会发现我吧?
He's not gonna see me, is he?

793
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,232
哇
Whoa.

794
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:42,078
哇 看这上面的景色
Wow, would you look at the view from up here?

795
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,789
- 几乎可以看到布达佩斯(匈牙利首都)  - 乌 达 佩斯?
- You could almost see Budapest.  - Who-da-pest?

796
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,791
是在夏威威附近吗?
Is that near Ha-wi-fi?

797
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,670
啊? 哦 你是说夏威夷吧 是啊 那里超赞的
Huh? Oh, you mean Hawaii. Yeah, that place is a knockout.

798
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,755
我刚去那里参加了音乐节
l just went to a music festival there.

799
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,715
人类的音乐节?
A human music festival?

800
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,467
呃 我觉得是
Uh, I believe so.

801
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,637
那 他们会不会想咬断你的脚趾 还拼命塞给你大蒜面包?
So, did they all bite your toes and shove garlic bread in your face?

802
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,722
那倒没有 不过有个家伙
No. Well, one dude took a bigger bite

803
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,391
咬了我的能量棒一大口
out of my energy bar than I expected,

804
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,892
不过应该是太热的关系
but I blame that on the heat.

805
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,645
好神奇呀 你哪里都去过
It's amazing. You've been everywhere.

806
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,814
是啊 要不干什么?
Well, you know, what's the alternative?

807
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,484
呆在家里 足不出户 不知天下事?
Just staying at home, never exploring, never seeing what's out there?

808
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:18,698
一生只有一次121岁 对吧? 要活在当下
I'm only gonna be 121 once, right? Got to live it.

809
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,242
太对了
Yeah.

810
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:27,915
- 哦 天哪 这里看日出肯定很...  - 喔
- Oh, man. The sunrise from here must be amaz...  - Ow.

811
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,417
哦 对不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

812
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,586
天哪 你是不是从来没见过日出?
Man, you've probably never even seen a sunrise, have you?

813
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,754
呃 没有 怎么?
No, not really. Why?

814
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,256
过来 我有办法了
Come on. I have an idea.

815
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,427
看
Watch.

816
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,453
- 啊  - 啊
- Ahh.  - Ahh.

817
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:10,458
告诉过你们这里好玩吧? 是不是超级有趣?
Didn't I tell you guys we'd have fun in here? Is this not the best?

818
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,422
是啊 汗流浃背什么的是很有趣
Yeah, I'm working up a nice sweat.

819
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,674
那个约翰尼的啥时候才能安排好派对呀?
When's that Johnny kid gonna be done party planning?

820
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,843
- 超爱和他一起玩  - 是啊 他真够疯狂的
- He's a great hang.  - Yeah, he's an animal.

821
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,888
现在梅维丝也对他青睐有加了 真好
And it was so nice seeing Mavis laughing and hitting it off with him.

822
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,599
谁青睐谁? 少来
Who's hitting what off? Please.

823
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:30,102
梅维丝才不会和他这种类型的在一起
Mavis could never be with someone of his kind.

824
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:33,522
什么? "他这种类型"?
I'm sorry? "His kind"?

825
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,900
你是说我们家的孩子不够好吗
You're saying our kind's not good enough for you,

826
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,568
"陛下"?
"Your Lordship"?

827
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,403
不 不 不! 弗兰克 我没...
No, no, no! Frank, I didn't...

828
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:44,408
我是说她不会喜欢头发又红又卷的类型
I meant that she wouldn't be into someone with such red, curly hair.

829
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:46,827
呃 又红又卷的头发怎么了?
Uh, what's wrong with red, curly hair?

830
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,204
你生什么气?
Why are you getting upset?

831
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,206
我的头发就是又红又卷的!
I have red curly hair!

832
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,333
鬼才知道你长了什么毛
Well, how was I supposed to know that?

833
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:10,810
这真是我见过的最美的景象
This is the most incredible thing l've ever seen.

834
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,313
约翰尼?
Johnny?

835
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:15,731
冷静 伙计们
Look, settle down, fellas.

836
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,901
还有啥意义呀 约翰尼已经走了
This is all a moot point because Johnny, he left.

837
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,236
等等 他走了?
Wait a minute. He left?

838
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:23,656
是啊 他说他不喜欢梅维丝 也不喜欢我们
Yes. He decided he didn't like Mavis, or any of us.

839
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,868
嗨
Hi.

840
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:29,495
呃 看来约翰尼改变主意了
Hmm. I guess Johnny had second thoughts.

841
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,884
你竟然还敢留下 你还是不懂
I can't believe you stuck around, man. You don't get it.

842
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,178
你的处境非常危险
Bad things are coming your way.

843
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:49,265
冷静 理清头绪
I got... I got to get my thoughts together.

844
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,725
好了
Okay.

845
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,226
看到这些桌子没?
You see these tables?

846
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,062
你用这一整天把他们推出来
You can spend the entire day pulling them out

847
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,189
然后摆摆整齐 派对策划
and placing them, party planner.

848
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,233
太棒了 我就困在这儿了
Fantastic. I'm trapped here.

849
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,444
我算是理解你女儿了
Now I know how your daughter feels.

850
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:11,662
够了! 够了! 停下来!
Enough! Enough! Stop!

851
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,330
站在墙角 休息一下!
Go to a corner, you're in a timeout!

852
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,416
休息? 我可是个成年人!
Timeout? I'm a grown man!

853
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,584
啊啊啊!
Ahh!

854
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:25,760
好 57号桌子 请到23号就位
Okay. Table 57, please move to position 23.

855
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:26,927
哇
Whoa.

856
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,183
- 酷毙了  - 面对墙壁
- That is cool.  - Face the wall.

857
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:37,104

17 to 48. 16 to 47. 19 to 50.

858
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,025
- 额滴亲娘啊  - 给我安静点
- Awesomeness.  - Just let me do my work.

29到35
29 to 35.

860
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,945
42到18 10到44
42 to 18. 10 to 44.

861
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,947
啊 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

862
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:48,491
39到24
39 to 24.

863

864
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,577
29到35
29 to 35.

865
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,583

Seven to 25. 14 to 30.

869
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,233
哪去了 老大爷?
Where'd you go, grandpa?

870
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,235
别吓到了 重力小子
Don't freak out, gravity face.

871
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,487
等着认输吧 老尖牙!
Eat my dust, gray fangs!

872
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,697
56和43 到我身边来
56 and 43, to my side.

873
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,160

Whoo!

874
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:43,003

That's how we do it! Half-pipe, baby!

876
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,511
还不就那样
Whatever.

877
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,640
对 就这么闻
Yes. Keep smelling.

878
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:59,812
抓住人类 老子给你做人肉馅饼!
You catch the human, and then I will make human potpie!

27, 45, 65, 76, 48, block his path.

请勿打扰!
Do not disturb!

887
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:34,930
有人睡着呢!
People trying to sleep here!

888
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,361
看到了吗?
Did you see that?

889
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,989
那家伙是谁呀 霹雳侠吗?
Who is that guy, Sir Breaks-a-lot?

890
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:58,412
哦 天哪 我承认 真好玩 是吧?
Oh, boy, I have to say, that was fun. Okay?

891
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:02,833
你之前不是说乐子吗? 名不虚传!
The fun you were talking about earlier? Nailed it!

892
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,336
约翰尼?
Johnny?

893
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,632
卡西莫多!
Quasimodo!

894
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:22,895
梅维丝? 你怎么还不睡? 太阳出来了 会伤着你的 我的心肝
Mavis? Why are you still up? The sun is out. It could kill you, my honeyguts.

895
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,189
睡不着 知道约翰尼在哪吗?
l couldn't sleep. Do you know where Johnny went?

896
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,690
不知道 他...
I don't know. He...

897
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,901
- 你知道这干嘛?  - 哦 呃...
- Why do you want to know?  - Oh! Uh...

898
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,945
- 你喜欢他?  - 什么?
- Do you like him?  - What?

899
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,240
切 才不 拜托了 老爸 他又奇怪又笨
Pfft, no. Come on, Dad. He's so weird and awkward.

900
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:37,660
都不知道他是真笨还是太可爱?
It's like, are you an idiot or do you know you're adorable?

901
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,664
呃... 等等
Eh... Hold that.

902
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,500
- 知道卡西莫多的确切位置吗?  - 是的 先生
- Do you have a location on Quasimodo?  - Yes, sir.

903
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,210
他们正要穿过大厅 去往厨房
They're heading through the lobby, towards the kitchen.

904
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,628
让他们立刻停下来
I need them stopped immediately.

905
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,380
- 听清楚了没?  - 非常清楚
- Is that clear?  - Yes, quite.

906
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,965
我们马上去办
We are on it.

907
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:58,889
哈哈! 没打着!
Ha-ha! Missed!

908
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,478
你们这是干什么? 让我过去!
What is the meaning of this? Let me pass!

909
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:07,022
卡西莫多・威尔逊 跟我们走
Quasimodo Wilson, you are coming with us.

910
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,151
我咋会痛呢?
Why did that hurt me?

911
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:18,033
听着 宝贝 你才多大啊 还不懂爱情呢
Look, honey, there's no falling in love at your age.

912
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,744
妈妈当时就这么大啊 尤尼斯说妈妈先亲的你
Mom was my age. Eunice says Mom kissed you first

913
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,830
因为你不敢对她动手动脚
'cause you were too scared to make the first move.

914
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,415
是 是 是 是 是 是
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

915
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,709
别提我和你妈还有什么亲嘴了
Forget about me and Mom and kissing.

916
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,628
爸爸 总有一天 我会要结婚的
Dad, at some point, I'm going to get married.

917
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,131
- 我不能一辈子呆在这里  - 什么? 为啥不能?
- I can't be here forever.  - What? Why not?

918
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:35,217
你还没脱牙套呢
You're barely out of your training fangs.

919
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:08,542
哈 哈!
Ha-ha!

920
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,336
我又赢了!
Quasi wins again!

921
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:14,089
一拳下去 屁屁着地!
When you bump with the hump, you land on your rump!

922
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:23,182
你怎么突然感兴趣了?
But why all the sudden interest?

923
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:26,018
每次我们谈到爱情 你总说
Every time we used to talk about love, it was always,

924
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,936
"哦 爸爸 真恶心耶"
"Ooh, Dad, that's gross,"

925
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:30,773
或者 "哦 爸爸 我不要知道这些啦"
and "Ooh, Dad, I don't want to know about that."

926
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,149
我也不知道
I don't know.

927
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,943
- 先生 他到厨房去了  - 他什么?
- Sir, he made it into the kitchen.  - He what?

928
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,403
你是干什么吃的?
What do I pay you for?

929
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,572
对不起 宝贝 我要走了
I'm sorry, honey. I have to go.

930
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,909
我啥也没吃
He doesn't pay me.

931
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,414
在你杀我之前
Before you kill me,

932
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,125
能不能让我给背包留个遗言?
can I please talk to my backpack one more time?

933
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:52,503
我不想就这么丢下它
I don't want to leave anything unresolved.

934
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,797
你好 德库拉先生
Bonjour, Monsieur Dracula.

935
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,298
闭上你的臭嘴
Shut your hump hole.

936
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:57,800
你要帮他?
Now you are helping him?

937
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,927
你到底和这人类是啥关系?
What is it with you and this human?

938
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,304
他不是人类 他是科学怪人家的人!
He is not human. He's a Stein!

939
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,598
是啊 矮子 我是科学怪人家的
That's right, little man, I'm a Stein!

940
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:08,602
如果他是怪兽 让他吓吓埃斯梅拉达!
If he is a monster, let him scare Esmeralda!

941
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:10,229
那只老鼠?
The mouse?

942
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,356
切! 小意思
Pfft! Without a doubt.

943
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,650
好吧 看我的
Okay. Here we go.

944
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,111
呃啊!
Blargh!

945
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,821
呃哦!
Bleegh!

946
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,781
呃啊 呃哦 呃啊!
Blargy-bliggy-blargh!

947
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:28,914
人类! 是人类!
A human! A human!

948
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:33,669
先生把人类带进了...
Monsieur has brought a human into the...

949
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:40,134
埃斯梅拉达 帮帮我
Esmeralda, help me.

950
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:53,772
嘿 多谢你救我
Hey, thanks for saving me back there.

951
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:56,567
那家伙疯了 想吃掉我
That guy's crazy! Trying to eat me.

952
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:00,612
这事只发生过一次 在活结乐队的演唱会上有个怪蜀黍
That's only happened to me one other time. This weird dude at a Slipknot concert.

953
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:03,240
我要给你看样东西
There's something I need to show you.

954
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:14,877
喔
Wow.

955
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,045
嘿 我们在参加葬礼吗?
Hey, are we at a funeral right now?

956
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,673
哦 等等 不是 这是你的床
Oh, wait, no, it's your bed.

957
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:23,177
爽得让人脊梁发冷啊
So creepy and cool.

958
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,220
喔! 我知道她!
Wow! I know her!

959
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:29,475
我在爱之堡的废墟里见过这张照片 那是我最爱的城堡
l've seen that picture at the ruins of Lubov. That's my favorite castle.

960
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,477
据说那女人有一段传奇故事
There's a whole legend around that lady.

961
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,644
传奇故事?
A legend?

962
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,731
爱之女士
The Lady Lubov.

963
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,484
故事讲的是一个孤独的伯爵
The story is that a lonely count

964
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:41,653
偶遇了她 人们都说从未见过
met her by chance, and they say that no two souls

965
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,822
如此心心相印的两个人
were ever more meant for each other.

966
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:47,743
最后 他们安顿在爱之堡 也有了孩子
Eventually, they settled down at Castle Lubov and had a child.

967
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:51,455
不过后来 可怕的悲剧发生了
But then, a horrible tragedy happened.

968
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:56,084
那晚 一场神秘的大火烧死了他们
A fire started mysteriously one night, and it killed both of them.

969
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:03,425
当我走进城堡 仍能感受到他们摄人心魄的爱情
When I was at the castle, I could still feel their powerful love.

970
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:08,055
人们说 就好像有一个灵魂仍被困在他们的残骸当中
They say it's as if a soul is still trapped in the ruins themselves.

971
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,517
你的故事错了
The legend is wrong.

972
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:17,064
只有妻子死在大火里
It was only the wife that died.

973
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,072
哦
Oh.

974
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:29,409
她的死因一点也不神秘
And it was no mystery who killed her.

975
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:33,205
她是被你们人类烧死的!
She was killed by your kind!

976
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,208
吸血鬼!
Vampire!

977
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,711
- 亲爱的?  - 去藏起来 我来处理
- Honey?  - Go hide. I'll take care of this.

978
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,632
吸血鬼!
Vampire!

979
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,929
玛莎!
Martha!

980
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:53,475
他们才是真正的鬼怪
They are the real monsters.

981
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:07,197
我为了我的爱人 保护我的孩子建造这屋宇
I built this place for my love, to protect her child.

982
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:11,201
身为人父 会为了保护家庭赴汤蹈火
As a father, you do everything to keep your family safe,

983
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:15,038
即便失去他们对你的信任也在所不辞
even if you have to break their trust.

984
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:19,751
可现在 梅维丝喜欢上了你
But now, Mavis has feelings for you.

985
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:20,919
什么?
What?

986
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:23,046
我... 我只是...
I... I just...

987
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,259
- 好极了  - 没事的
- Awesome.  - It's all right.

988
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,094
你是个好人
You are a good one.

989
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,847
如果世界不一样了 也许你们还有可能
lf the world was different, maybe it would be possible.

990
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,266
德库拉 这都21世纪了
Drac, this is the 21st century.

991
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,476
人们已经和以前不一样了
People aren't the same as they were back then.

992
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,938
你确定 如果我们公开自己的身份
Can you tell me for certain that if we came out in the open,

993
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:41,440
每个人都会接纳我们?
everyone would accept us?

994
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,649
每个人?
Everyone?

995
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:48,238
好吧 你没说错
No. You're right.

996
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,908
这次我会永远不会回来了
I'll go for good this time.

997
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:53,285
你就说我有点急事
You can just say I had some emergency,

998
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,954
或者我被一个小精灵吃掉了之类的
or the gremlin lady ate me or something.

999
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,497
不 不 不 不 不
No, no, no, no, no.

1000
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:00,375
我不想搞砸她的生日派对
I don't want to ruin her birthday party.

1001
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,670
你可以在结束了之后溜走
You can sneak out after it's all done.

1002
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,131
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1003
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:09,551
我不想伤害她
The last thing I wanted was to hurt her.

1004
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:10,802
还有你
Or you.

1005
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:15,766
其实 你扮科学怪人没有天分
You know, you're not the smoothest Frankenstein,

1006
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,352
可你会是一个好吸血鬼
but you'd make a great vampire.

1007
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:19,519
真的?
For real?

1008
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,355
我就说我有一双催眠眼
'Cause I think I kind of got your hypno-eyes down.

1009
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,066
哦 天哪 好吧 让我看看
Oh, boy, here we go. Let me see it.

1010
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,527
小心! 因为你在我统治之下
Beware! For you are in my power.

1011
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:30,238
我命令你成为狼人!
I command you to be the werewolf man!

1012
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,992
我有好几个孩子呢
I have too many kids.

1013
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,330
给我挠挠 我有虱子
Someone scratch me, I have fleas.

1014
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:41,500
因为他是狼人 狼人有虱子
'Cause he's a wolf, he'd get those.

1015
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,126
是啊 别 别解释
Yeah, no, don't explain it.

1016
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,836
解释就不好玩了
It's not funny when you do that.

1017
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,818
我又没订唤醒服务
I didn't order a wake-up call.

1018
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,946
德库拉伯爵给每个房间都订了
Count Dracula arranged it for all the rooms.

1019
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,241
那个打盹的按钮呢?
Where's the snooze button?

1020
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,535
不能打盹 派对是今天
There will be no snoozing. The party's today.

1021
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:40,600
哦 就这样 好极了
Ooh, yeah, perfecto.

1022
00:58:49,157 --> 00:58:52,333
118岁生日快乐――妈妈

1023
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:56,533
 姑娘哟 
 Girl 

1024
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,952
 难以置信 你今天就要成年 
 I can't believe it's your big night 

1025
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:03,749
 到吃青蛙的年纪 到疯狂派对的时间 
 You ate your frogs, now the party's so right 

1026
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:07,127
 姑娘 时光消失到了哪儿 
 Where did the time go, girl? 

1027
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,176
 姑娘 你曾经只能吸兔子的血 
 And, girl, you used to suck a binky 

1028
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,553
 看看现在 
 Look at you now 

1029
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:20,599
 你已能制服一整头牛 
 You're sucking blood right out of the cow 

1030
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,309
哇
Wow.

1031
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,603
你真美
You look beautiful.

1032
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,938
谢谢 谢谢你办的派对
Thanks. Thanks for the party.

1033
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:29,024
是啊 喜欢我的小魔术吗?
Yeah, you like my little touches?

1034
00:59:33,144 --> 00:59:36,365
巴黎

1035
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:39,595
纽约

1036
00:59:39,595 --> 00:59:43,719
莫斯科

1037
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:46,097
夏威威

1038
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,590
太神奇了
It's amazing.

1039
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,184
- 派对真棒  - 你可真是超越了自己啊 德库拉
- Terrific party.  - You really outdid yourself, Drac.

1040
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,937
这是我500年来参加过的最好的派对
Got to be the best one l've been to in 500 years.

1041
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:19,241
抱歉 巨人
Sorry, big man.

1042
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:41,096
呃 梅维丝?
Uh, Mavis?

1043
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,056
我现在超级害怕
I'm crazily scared right now.

1044
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,517
可能这是件好事
Maybe that's a good thing.

1045
01:00:57,696 --> 01:01:00,991
你怎么能这样? 我还和你分享了我的痛苦?
How could you? After I shared my pain with you?

1046
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,742
- 可 不是...  - 爸爸 只是接吻而已啦
- But, no...  - Dad, it was just a kiss.

1047
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,411
不 你不可以接吻
No, you're not allowed to kiss.

1048
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,914
爸爸 我可以做任何事 我不是38岁的孩子了
Dad, I'm allowed to do things. I'm not 38 anymore.

1049
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,208
我可以喜欢别人 或者去看看外面的世界
I'm allowed to like people, or go see the world again.

1050
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:12,919
什么? 你看到了! 你说你不喜欢那里!
What? You saw it! You said you didn't like it!

1051
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,838
也许我想去村庄再试一次
Maybe I want to give the village another chance.

1052
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,924
我只是需要学习 知道怎么随波逐流 就像约翰尼这样
l just need to learn, you know, just how to roll with it, like Johnny does.

1053
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:20,927
不 不 你不能再去那个村庄了
No, no, you can't go to the village again.

1054
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,470
也许你能让他们知道 我们可以做朋友呢
Maybe you can make them see that we could be friends.

1055
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,055
不 那不可能
No, that isn't possible.

1056
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,349
你凭什么这么肯定 只是看你怎么展示自己罢了
Well, you can't be sure. It's all in how you present yourself.

1057
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,310
- 不 根本没用  - 你怎么知道?
- No, that won't make a difference!  - How do you know?

1058
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:29,728
- 就因为没用! -为什么?为什么没用?
- Because it just won't!  - Why? Why won't it?

1059
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,314
因为那村庄根本不存在!
Because that village doesn't really exist!

1060
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:39,905
什么叫"不存在"?
What do you mean "doesn't exist"?

1061
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:41,823
你做了什么?
What did you do?

1062
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:44,242
我只是做了我必须做的事
l did what I had to do.

1063
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:45,452
是什么?
What was it?

1064
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:49,164
你到底做了什么? 告诉我!
What exactly did you have to do? Tell me!

1065
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:56,296
我... 我建了那个小镇 那些人是我弄来的
I... I built the town. The staff put it all together.

1066
01:01:56,379 --> 01:02:00,508
僵尸们扮演了镇上的人
The zombies dressed up as the townspeople.

1067
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,471
别生气 我...
Please. I...

1068
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,807
如果你真的在外面遇到什么危险
If you really went out there and something happened to you,

1069
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:10,477
我肯定不能原谅自己
I just couldn't live with myself.

1070
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,731
但是你能原谅自己这样做? 对我说谎? 骗我?
But you can live with this? Lying to me? Tricking me?

1071
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,984
尽管你知道我梦想着离开 但还是要把我永远留在这里
Keeping me here forever when you knew my dream was to go.

1072
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,696
骗子! 骗子!
Liar! Liar!

1073
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:23,740
是邋遢厨子?

人类世界 在约翰尼永远离开之前

1171
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:10,271
我不知道 我大概得跟着混了

01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:29,035
你也吃羊排 没什么区别
You eat lamb chops, it's the same thing.

1206
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,995
我们没时间说这个了 快点 开车!
We don't have time for this. Come on, let's move it!

1207
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,210
看 有个人!
Look, a human.

1208
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:43,633
欢迎来到精灵旅社！
Welcome to Transylvania!

1209
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,763
我有点晕了
That was trippy.

1210
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:50,431
怪物节?
Monster Festival?

1211
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:52,391
什么是怪物节?
What's a Monster Festival?

1212
01:11:54,882 --> 01:11:57,091
我们爱德库拉
We love Dracula

1213
01:11:57,182 --> 01:11:58,591
我为科学怪人举火把
I carry a torch for Frankenstein

1214
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:01,317
他们早知道我们要来?
Did they know we were coming?

1215
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:25,883
他们喜欢我们?
They like us?

1216
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,468
真的?
Really?

1217
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:31,430
打扰一下 你知道去机场最快的路线吗?
Excuse me? Do you know the best way to the airport?

1218
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:35,309
知道 德库拉老兄 只有那一条路 哇啊啊
Yes, fellow Dracula. There's only one way. Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1219
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:39,021
但是路被堵住了 我们不可能及时赶到的
But it's all blocked. We'll never make it in time.

1220
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,857
你应该提前一小时出来的 哇啊啊
You should have left an hour earlier. Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1221
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:44,610
我从来不说"哇啊啊"
I do not say "Bleh, bleh-bleh."

1222
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:48,072
好吧 我们跑过去吧
All right, let's just run through it on foot.

1223
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:56,122
德库拉 这个会保护你的
Drac, this'll protect you.

1224
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,623
哇啊啊
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1225
01:12:57,748 --> 01:13:00,459
Imagine if that guy knew he was talking to the real Drac,
想象一下 如果那个人知道他是在和真的德库拉说话

1226
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:02,253
他会吓的跑得远远的!
he'd run for the hills!

1227
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,589
等一下 等一下
Hold it, now. Hold it, now.

1228
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:06,215
这可说到点上了
That sounds spot on.

1229
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:10,469
不过只有我们展示出来我们是真的 他们才会知道
But the only way they'd know the real us is if we show the real us.

1230
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:11,762
这个办法不错
This could work.

1231
01:13:11,846 --> 01:13:14,557
你是说 比如 吓唬他们? 我们都有几个世纪没吓唬过人类了
You mean, like, scare them? We haven't scared people in centuries.

1232
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,892
我甚至都不觉得我还知道怎么吓唬人
I don't even think I have it in me anymore.

1233
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,606
我不会了 我真的什么都不会了
I got nothing. I really got nothing.

1234
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:23,316
只要划一下火柴就好了
Let's just move this along.

1235
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,867
火! 火!
Fire! Fire!

1236
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,327
火!
Fire!

1237
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:50,551
我在吓唬你们!
I'm trying to scare you!

1238
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:52,386
我是真正的科学怪人！
The real Frankenstein!

1239
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,472
我们知道! 我们爱你!
We know! We love you!

1240
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:56,015
你能在我的火把上签个名吗?
Can you sign my torch?

1241
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:03,606
听着 说正事之前 我先告诉大家那位是真正的德库拉!
Listen, before anything else, down there's the real Dracula!

1242
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,191
能证明吗?
Prove it.

1243
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:07,485
好吧 继续
All right. Continue.

1244
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:11,405
德库拉的女儿坠入爱河了 而他需要赶到机场!
Drac's daughter's in love, and he's got to get to the airport!

1245
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,699
但他没法穿过人海!
And he can't get through this crowd!

1246
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:17,370
- 他为什么不飞过去?  - 因为太阳 你个笨蛋 他是吸血鬼
- Why doesn't he fly?  - The sun, you idiot. He's a vampire.

1247
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:20,122
说得好 谢谢你 书呆子怪物
That's right. Thank you, Monster Nerd.

1248
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:25,086
那么 如果你们真的是我们的朋友 请为他让出一条路来!
So, people, if you really are our friends, clear a path for the man!

1249
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:29,215
好吧 所有吸血鬼 列队 哇啊啊
Okay. All Draculas, line up. Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1250
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:37,348
其他人拉起斗篷 保护我们的朋友 哇啊啊
Everyone else, lift the capes. Protect our friend. Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1251
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:47,233
这都是为了你 老兄
It's all for you, buddy.

1252
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:50,152
去吧
Go ahead.

1253
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:51,487
- 祝你好运!  - 去找到他们!
- Good luck!  - Go get them!

1254
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:52,613
快 德库拉 快!
Go, Drac, go!

1255
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,573
- 去吧 德库拉!  - 快 德库拉!
- Go, Drac!  - Go, Drac!

1256
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:56,200
加油 德库拉!
Go, Drac!

1257
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:00,037
快点 德库拉!
Go, Drac!

1258
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,333
去吧 德库拉!
Go, Drac!

1259
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,127
去找他们吧!
Go get them!

1260
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:09,338
快点 德库拉!
Go, Drac, go!

1261
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:12,800
我们爱你 德库拉!
We love you, Dracula!

1262
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:28,816
别无选择了
There's no choice.

1263
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:08,647
嗷 嗷 嗷 嗷
Ouch. Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1264
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:10,816
好吧 我必须这么做
Okay. Okay, I must do this.

1265
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:32,671
约翰尼 约翰尼 你能听见我说话吗?
Jonathan. Jonathan, can you hear me?

1266
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:35,800
告诉我 你想变成吸血鬼吗?
Tell me, do you dream of being a vampire?

1267
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:38,928
他们就是这样描写我们的 难以置信
This is how we're represented. Unbelievable.

1268
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:41,097
嘿 约翰尼
Jonathan. Jonathan.

1269
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:43,098
你能听见吗?
Can you hear me?

1270
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:44,683
哇! 蝙蝠!
Whoa! Bat!

1271
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:47,603
等下 它在说话 德库拉? 是你吗?
Wait, it's talking. Dracula? Is that you?

1272
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,397
什么? 德库拉
Huh? Dracula.

1273
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:53,025
我听不见你说话
I can't understand you.

1274
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:56,112
什么? 棕色皮鞋里有我的爪子?
What? My hand's in a tan shoe?

1275
01:16:56,195 --> 01:17:00,282
什么? 日本在吃炖羊扒?
What? Japan's eating lamb stew?

1276
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:02,368
嘿 你知道你在冒烟吗?
Hey, do you know you're smoking?

1277
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:09,291
哦
Oh.

1278
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:10,626
对不起 不好意思
Pardon me. Sorry, excuse me.

1279
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:12,378
啊 对不起
Whoa! Excuse me.

1280
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:29,228
- 这是什么鬼东西?  - 蝙蝠怎么能飞这么高?
- What the heck?  - How'd a bat get up this high?

1281
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:34,191
乘客朋友们 我将点亮安全带指示灯 只是为了防止在我们...
Folks, I'm gonna turn on the seat belt sign. Just a precaution while we...

1282
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:41,615
听到一段特别声明的过程中出现意外 这是为我的朋友约翰尼准备的
While we hear a special announcement for my dear friend Jonathan.

1283
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:42,867
是德库拉?
Dracula?

1284
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:47,329
我亲爱的的孩子 我犯了严重的错误
My dear boy, I have made a terrible mistake.

1285
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:51,041
我试着让我的宝贝女儿呆在我身边
I was trying to keep my baby to myself,

1286
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:53,794
因为我以为 我可以一直保护她
because I knew I would always protect her.

1287
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:59,466
但我现在意识到 孩子们需要自己去探索
But I realize now, children need to discover things for themselves.

1288
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:03,470
他们会跌倒 会摔跤 这过程中有笑有泪
They'll stumble and fall, laugh and cry,

1289
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:05,347
但这就是生活
but such is life.

1290
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:08,809
事实上 你和梅维丝是天生一对
The truth is, you and Mavis are meant to be.

1291
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:10,352
你们一见钟情
You Zinged.

1292
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:13,355
如果她除了我之外必须信任另外的人
If she must give her trust to someone else,

1293
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:16,525
那我很高兴那人是你 约翰尼
I'm thankful that it is you, Jonathan.

1294
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:20,946
我希望你能听见我说话并且原谅我
I hope you can hear me and forgive me.

1295
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:39,423
好了 乘客朋友们 我们将马上调头回去加油
Okay, folks, we're going to make a quick turnaround to refuel,

1296
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:41,717
之后我们将正常航行
and then we'll be back on our way.

1297
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:45,679
别抱怨了! 我身上都着火了!
Quit your whining! I'm burning up out here!

1298
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:00,152
爸?
Dad?

1299
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:06,450
我没事 有点晒伤而已
I'm fine. I'm just a little sunburnt.

1300
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:10,079
亲爱的
Honey,

1301
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:15,751
我一直以为最糟糕的是就是看着你离开
I always thought the worst thing ever would be seeing you go.

1302
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:19,338
但是最糟的是看见你不开心
But the worst is seeing you unhappy.

1303
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,466
梅维丝 我想让你拥有属于自己的生活
Mavey, I want you to live your life.

1304
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:26,762
我不知道该怎么做
I don't know how I'm supposed to do that.

1305
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,725
你知道的 你妈妈已经送给你生日礼物了
You know, Mommy already gave you her birthday present.

1306
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:33,811
现在给你我的礼物好吗?
Can I now give you mine?

1307
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:37,690
我要这个有什么用?
What do I need this for?

1308
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,234
哦 它还有个配件
Oh, it comes with an accessory.

1309
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,655
- 是你?  - 是你
- You?  - You.

1310
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:46,824
你怎么回来了?
Why are you back?

1311
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:52,663
因为你是我的梦中情人 梅维丝
Because you're my Zing, Mavis.

1312
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,748
我是你的梦中情人?
I'm your Zing?

1313
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:57,668
但是你说你讨厌怪物
But you told me you hate monsters.

1314
01:19:57,751 --> 01:20:00,671
是 因为当时我害怕如果我不那么说
Yeah, well, I was afraid your dad was gonna

1315
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:03,048
你爸爸就会吸干我的血
suck all the blood out of my body if I didn't say that.

1316
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,842
我才不会...
I wouldn't have...

1317
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,802
不 他说得对 我会那么干的
No, he's right, I would have done that.

1318
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:09,930
- 爸  - 我错了 我认定他们都很坏
- Dad.  - I was wrong, Devil-chops.

1319
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:15,644
你真的同意 老爸?
Do you really mean it, Dad?

1320
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,356
去创造你们自己的天堂吧
Go make your own paradise.

1321
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:25,487
我可以试着重新亲你一次吗?
Can we try that kiss over again?

1322
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:28,198
我想可以
I think we can.

1323
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:35,873
对不起 我只是... 我得学着习惯这个
Sorry. I just... I got to get used to that.

1324
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:38,584
继续 做你们的事吧
Go. Do your thing.

1325
01:20:43,956 --> 01:20:46,584
祝梅维丝生日快乐
Happy Birthday Mavis

1326
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:50,512
停! 停!
Stop! Stop!

1327
01:20:56,143 --> 01:20:58,062
 我以为我找到了真爱 但那只是幻影 
 I thought I found a love but she was just a fling 

1328
01:20:58,145 --> 01:20:59,897
 后来遇到一个女孩 我发现不同的事情 
 And then I met a girl and felt a different thing 

1329
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:02,066
 就好像是被击中 被绳子拽着前行 
 It's like you're hit in the ring Like you're pulled by a string 

1330
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,817
 我无法呼吸 就像骨头卡住脖颈 
 Can't breathe like you're choking on a chicken wing 

1331
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:05,944
 这感觉是一见钟情 让我唱给你听 
 It was a thing called a Zing and I wanted to sing 

1332
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:07,821
 一起聆听那首小调 它来自斯汀 
 And listen to ballads of the man named Sting 

1333
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:09,823
 看着你的眼睛 就好像是春天已经来临 
 Lady looks in your eyes and it's suddenly spring 

1334
01:21:09,907 --> 01:21:11,742
 就像狮子王里 当娜娜看着辛巴的眼睛 
 Like when Nala looked at Simba in The Lion King 

1335
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:17,664
 我竟然没察觉到爱情的来临
