I absolutely rely on Mr Powell.I hope you can understand that.

83
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,580
不论你有什么想法
Whatever you may think

84
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,640
我知道你跟他之间到底发生了什么
and I do understand what's been happening

85
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
我想问你  请你...

99
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,610
鲍威尔先生

it's time to cast your votes for your favourite nurse.

102
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,430
冠军将会是来自凯越缇的威尔林护士
Will it be Nurse Welling from Casualty?

103
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,710
还是汤姆林森护士呢
Or will it be Nurse Tomlinson?

104
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,480
亦或是众学子的最爱  图特护士呢
Or will it be our students' favourite,Nurse Tutt?

105
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,500
你为什么没有告诉我工作的事  查理
Why did you lie to me about the job, Charlie?

106
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,620
是因为奥托  对不对
It's Otto, isn't it?

107
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,530
有时候我甚至都以为你会跟他一起消失掉
I sometimes think you believe you'd disappear without him.

108
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,410
你明知道我们本可以在圣奥尔本过得很幸福的
We could have been happy in St Albans,you know that.

109
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,440
- 我在这儿也很幸福  - 你到底在害怕什么
- I'm happy here. - What are you so frightened of?

110
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,400
我没有害怕什么  莉莉
Nothing, Lily.

111
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,410
- 我没有  - 那就别甩脸就走
- I'm not. - Then don't walk away from me,please.

112
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,530
我是爱你的  查理・安德伯雷
I love you, Charlie Enderbury.

113
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,620
我从第一次看到你就芳心暗许  但是...
I have ever since the moment I first clapped eyes on you, but...

114
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,570
我希望我们能够幸福
I want us to be happy.

115
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,580
而我们在这里根本得不到幸福的
We can't be happy here,

116
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,520
因为你的顾虑  因为世俗的眼光
with you concerned about what everyone will think.

117
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,630
这些会让你觉得自己罪无可恕
Convincing yourself you've made mistake after mistake and...

118
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,430
而我又发誓要保守伊丽莎白还有简的秘密
and me sworn to secrets and all sorts with Elizabeth,and Jean.

119
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,400
简是个好人  但是...
Lovely Jean, but...

120
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,500
我有时候会觉得她瞧不起我...
I sometimes wonder that she just thinks I'm...

121
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,610
我再也无法忍受下去了
I'm not sure what more I can stand.

122
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,540
什么秘密
What secrets?

123
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,540
我不该提及此事的  这些不值得一提
I should never have mentioned it.It's nothing.

124
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,400
别那样看着我
Don't look at me like that.

125
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,570
不应该提到什么  莉莉
Should never have mentioned what, Lily?

126
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,450
那...那个男人  好了  我告诉过你了
The... The man. There. I said it.

127
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
什么男人
What man?

128
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,640
莉莉
Lily?

129
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,590
你在说什么呢  什么男人  到底又是什么秘密
What are you talking about?What man?What secrets?

130
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,470
我向她保证过  我发过誓
I promised. I swore on everything I hold true.

131
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,410
向伊丽莎白吗  你发什么誓了  到底发生什么事了
To Elizabeth?What did you swear?What happened?

132
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,530
莉莉
Lily.

133
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,610
- 我发过誓不会告诉给任何人  - 那个男人是谁
- That I wouldn't tell anyone.- What was his name?

134
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,600
你敢吼我
You are shouting at me.

135
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,530
穆里根吗  穆里根警官吗
Mulligan? Sergeant Mulligan?

136
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,470
我就知道
I knew it.

137
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,450
- 我就知道我们在劫难逃  - 什么
- I knew it had to happen. - What?

138
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,530
- 你要干嘛  - 打给奥托
- What are you doing? - Phoning Otto.

139
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,620
不要  求你了  我答应过伊丽莎白
No, please, I promised Elizabeth.

140
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,470
求你了  我答应过她的  我受不了了  我真受不了了
Please,I promised!Oh,I can't stand this.I can't.

141
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,400
鲍威尔府邸
The Powell residence.

142
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,470
- 奥托在吗  - 他不在  安德伯雷医生
- Is Otto there? - No, Dr Enderbury.

143
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,420
他说他会回...
He said he was going back to the...

144
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,430
哦
Oh.

145
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,470
- 莉莉  你干...  - 我答应过伊丽莎白的
- Lily, what... - I promised Elizabeth.

146
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,530
现在  我要你把我当成一个正常的女人
Now perhaps you will treat me like a woman with two eyes

147
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,490
一五一十地告诉我到底怎么一回事
and two ears and half a brain and tell me what exactly is going on.

148
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,430
当你真正需要鲍威尔的时候他娘的却在哪儿呢
Where the hell is Powell when you really need him?

149
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,630
喝杯茶吧
Drink this.

150
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,480
据说茶能解酒
Assuage the effects of alcohol,so I'm told.

151
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,400
沃克夫人的丈夫在帕托尼公园撞上一棵大树
Mrs Walker's husband put the car into a tree on Putney Common.

152
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,440
从而导致她两度濒临死亡
Under the influence.Ambulance Service say she's fitted twice,

153
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,470
但是腹中胎儿仍然还有心跳
but the baby's heart is still beating.

154
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,620
但沃克夫人身上多处骨折  面部严重损伤
Multiple fractures, facial lacerations...

155
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,470
先生
Sir?

156
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,500
嗯  知道了
Right... Yes.

157
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,540
- 梅塔医生  准备好了就告诉我们  - 一切就绪
- Dr Mehta, tell us when we're ready.- Ready.

158
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,560
很好  医用棉签给我  谢谢
Excellent. Swab, please.

159
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,630
他要毁了我们
He's going to destroy us.

160
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,580
我所做的  我为奥托所做的
What I did... What I did for Otto...

161
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,590
我早就知道
I always knew...

162
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,410
走得了和尚走不了庙
Can't run from something like that.

163
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,600
你杀人了吗  查理
Did you kill someone, Charlie?

164
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,530
没有  没有  我吗  当然没有
No. No, me? Of course not.

165
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,600
这一切都发生在塞浦路斯
This was in Cyprus.

166
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,520
那天塞浦路斯很热
Hot,lovely Cyprus,Lil.The time of our lives.

167
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,450
我们打算为伊丽莎白订婚而庆祝
We wanted to celebrate Elizabeth getting engaged.

168
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,470
跟奥托订婚吗
Getting engaged to Otto?

169
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,400
不是  是跟格伦
No. To Glen.

170
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,440
格伦・索普
Lieutenant Glen Thorpe.

171
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,440
美国空军中尉
Yank US Air Force.

172
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,600
伊丽莎白在遇到奥托之前就跟别人结过婚吗
Elizabeth was married before Otto?

173
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,640
那他出什么事了
What happened to him?

174
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,520
伊丽莎白的未婚夫  她的未...
Elizabeth's fiance. The f...

175
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,490
那天晚上我们开车去海滩
That night we drove to the beach.

176
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,640
那儿曾经有个酒吧  现在或许还在
There was a bar. Probably still there.

177
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,400
是一个流氓开的
It was run by an absolute rogue of a chap.

178
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,440
而奥托跟格伦两个
But they drank...

179
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,470
当时喝得酩酊大醉
..Otto and Glen.

180
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,410
他们就好像在比赛一样
It was like a competition between them.

181
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,440
你清楚奥托的为人
You know what Otto's like.

182
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,540
奥托滴酒不沾的  查理
Otto doesn't drink, Charlie.

183
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,600
他就是从那之后才不沾酒的
He did then.

184
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,570
我是说他那种“我可以恣意妄为
No, what I mean is his confidence.

185
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,480
但总能金蝉脱壳”  连苍蝇都逃不过的自信
"I can do anything, get away with anything." No flies on Powell.

186
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,520
然后就出事儿了
Things work out.

187
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,510
我听不懂你到底在说什么  查理
I'm not sure what you're telling me,Charlie.

188
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
我在说真相
The truth.

189
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,610
你不是想知道真相吗
Isn't that what you want?

190
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,610
不  够了  亲爱的  别再说了
No, not any more, dear, please.

191
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,570
奥托翻了车
And Otto rolled the Jeep.

192
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
一旦人喝醉了
Easily done...

193
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,610
车祸就轻而易举
..if you're a drunk.

194
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,550
格伦当场身亡
Glen died instantly.

195
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,620
脖子都碎断成几节了
C1 and C2...snapped.

196
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,600
黎明时我们吧伊丽莎白送进医院
We got Elizabeth to a hospital at dawn.

197
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,420
那是一家修女开的小医院
Small place run by nuns.

198
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,410
她之后慢慢就痊愈了
She was going to be all right...

199
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,530
我们决定之后不再去想这件事
..and we thought,I suppose,no more about it.

200
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,440
可是我自从那天之后
No, I thought about it every day.

201
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,480
无时无刻不在回想这件事儿
Every day ever since.

202
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,600
但那个男人跟这件事又有什么干系
But what has that man got to do with it?

203
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,480
穆里根当时是军警警官
Mulligan was a sergeant in the military police.

204
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,520
当他发现那辆翻了的吉普车
When they found the Jeep...

205
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,570
还有格伦的尸体时
..and the body...

206
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,400
他就开始对我们问东问西
..he started asking questions.

207
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,410
很简单
It was simple.

208
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,450
他想得到答案而已
He wanted answers.

209
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,570
奥托给了他一笔钱
And Otto paid him off.

210
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
贿赂了他
He bribed him.

211
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,440
威尔森护士在吗
Is Nurse Wilson here?

212
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,600
她让我告诉你不能...
She asked me to tell you not...

213
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,430
请别这样
Please!

214
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,440
鲍威尔先生
Mr Powell!

215
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,600
安吉拉  求你别这样  我...
Angela, please, I'm...

216
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,940
抱歉  我向你保证  我没想过会...
I'm sorry. I promise. I never meant

217
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,039
没想过会怎样
Never meant what?

218
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,450
- 到底是什么  - 现在这样尴尬的境地
- What exactly? - For things to get like this.

219
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,610
因为你妻子被卷入进来了吗
For your wife to get involved, do you mean?

220
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,430
听着  我不想伤害你跟伊丽莎白
Look, I don't mean you or Elizabeth any harm.

221
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,420
你可以掌控任何事  但是不能掌控我  明白吗
You have power over everything but not me. Understand?

222
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,630
我想要你
I want you.

223
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,560
我想要跟你在一起
I want to be with you.

224
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,840
事情不是你想的那样简单  我不能就这样...
Nothing is simple like that.I can't just...

225
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,570
听我说...
Look...

226
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,510
可以变得...很简单的
It could...be simple.

227
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,420
你以为我就是一块你随手翻翻
Do you think you just turned over a stone and there I was...

228
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,490
就能发现的石头吗
..ready to be discovered by you?

229
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,480
不是
No.

230
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:11,129
我当然不是这样想的
Of course I don't.

231
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,630
你根本对我一无所知
You don't know anything about me.

232
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,420
我很抱歉  我做不到  我也不会这么做
I'm sorry, I can't. I won't.

233
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,610
你只需要花
Just imagine for one...

234
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,560
一小会儿的时间
..tiny moment that...

235
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,510
认为事情很简单
..everything was simple.

236
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,410
就这一刻
This moment.

237
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,430
此情此景
Here...

238
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
此时此刻
..now.

239
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,620
但...但是现实并不是那样
But... But it's not like that.

240
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,560
现实太...
It's too...

241
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,450
不行
No.

242
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,540
别这样  奥托
Please, Otto.

243
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,420
你得走了
You have to go.

244
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,440
明天早上
Tomorrow morning, then.

245
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,620
你只需要给点时间听我解释一下
Just give me some time to explain.

246
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,500
我明早上要值班
I'm on mornings.

247
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,400
没关系
It's all right.

248
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,490
那就再晚一点
Later.

249
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,450
四点钟
Four.

250
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,510
在凯悦咖啡厅等我
Meet me at the Regency Cafe.

251
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,510
拜托
Please.

252
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,580
拜托了
Please.

253
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,430
警察
Police!

254
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,440
请把门打开
Can you open the door, please?

255
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,450
门口  他们在门口
The door! They are at the door.

256
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,480
天呐  他们来了
For heaven's sake, they have come.

257
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,580
吉妮  安吉拉  天呐  他们来了
Jeannie! Angela!For heaven's sake,they have come.

258
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,610
瑞奇
Richie?

259
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,890
有检测到胎儿的心跳吗
Do we have a foetal heartbeat?

260
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,200
有心跳  但是心跳正在加速
Yes, but it's getting very fast.

261
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,490
母亲血压过低  现在濒临死亡
Mother is hypotensive.We're going to lose her.

262
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,400
今晚谁都不会死的
We're not losing anyone tonight.

263
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,600
各位  准备取出胎儿  手术刀给我
Gentlemen,I'm going to get this baby out now.Knife.

264
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,460
剪断脐带
Can this be cut, please?

265
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,550
汤普森警官
Inspector Thompson.

266
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,440
我完全想不到你会在这种地方出现
You are the last person I expected
to come across in a place like this,pal.

267
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,600
我正在拜访我的朋友
I'm visiting a friend.

268
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,510
只要你没违法犯纪就行
As long as you're within the law.

269
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,490
哈里  我不想惹麻烦  我只想知道莫琳平安无事
I don't want trouble, Harry. I just
want to see that Maureen is safe.

270
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,430
母亲
Mother.

271
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,480
我是为你好才那么做的
I was only doing what I thought was best.

272
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,610
我知道
I know.

273

I wanted you safely married.

274

Ron.

275
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,510
我来跟他说  贝蒂
I'll speak to him, Beatty.

276
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,490
我看见你带着一大队人马出来
You have come, I see, mob-handed, Thompson.

277
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,420
原来都用来寻找我女儿莫琳啊
All to track down my little Maureen.

278
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,600
我们得知她在这个地方
We had word she was at this address.

279
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,540
我告诉过你  亲爱的  我会找到她的
I told you, dearest, that I would find her.

280
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,450
我向你保证过
I assured you of that.

281
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,430
穆里根警官
Sergeant Mulligan.

282
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,560
曾经是  鲍威尔医生
As was, Dr Powell.

283
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,560
但现在我是检察长
Chief Inspector now.

284
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,560
我正在询问鲍威尔来这儿的目的  阁下
I was interrogating Powell as to his purpose here,sir.

285
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,640
汤普森之言似乎让我回想到之前
Thompson's zealotry appears to have led me back to you.

286
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,620
在一条满是泥泞的路上
Up a dusty road.

287
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,580
那是一条小径
A track.

288
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,430
的确如此
Quite so.

289
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,560
我就是喜欢跟你交谈  鲍威尔
I'd like a word, Powell, with you.

290
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,580
汤普森一直对穆里根夫人暗藏情愫
Thompson has something of a soft spot for Mrs Mulligan.

291
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,500
但他一直受限于伦理的约束
But he's burdened by a sense of right.

292
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,430
不像你  鲍威尔
Unlike you, Powell.

293
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,600
我们知道你会定期为一些妇女服务  并索取相应的报酬
We know what you do a bespoke service for women who can pay.

294
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,430
没有的事
No.

295
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,410
只有当她们有需要时才会去
For those that require it.

296
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,560
哦~  你那傲慢的态度看样在遇到制裁时才会消失
Oh, your high horse will look very broken when you face a judge.

297
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,600
你到底想要什么  穆里根
What do you want, Mulligan?

298
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,570
法律从未对你有所制裁  对吧
The law has never meant anything to you,has it?

299
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,460
不知你是否对塞浦路斯的事还有印象
What do you remember of Cyprus?

300
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,530
我可是记得有一只鞋
I remember a shoe.

301
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,410
一只空军士兵的鞋
An airman's shoe.

302
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,430
还有一具被移动过的尸体
And a moved body.

303
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,560
完全没印象
No.

304
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,560
我只记得付过你钱  穆里根
I remember paying you, Mulligan.

305
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,500
贿赂你  让你忘记那里发生的一切
Bribing you to forget all about it.

306
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,550
你一直都干得非常漂亮  不是吗
You've done very well, haven't you?

307
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,620
可是道不同不相为谋
But the paths we take are so different.

308
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,669
看看你  糊涂到以控制...
Look at you. The drunk who ends up ruling

309
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,570
你到底要干嘛
What is this about?

310
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,590
让我说...完
Let me...finish.

311
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,530
你在医院看到我却形同陌路
You cut me dead at the hospital, walked straight past me.

312
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,560
于是我就跟踪你回家
So I followed you home.

313
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,400
而我就在那时看见了伊丽莎白
It was when I saw Elizabeth.

314
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,480
你家里那朵优雅的白花
The white flowers in your home.

315
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,470
窗帘在微风轻拂中摇曳
The way the drapes blew in the breeze.

316
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,480
十分安闲
The comfort.

317
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,430
然后我才完全意识到  这些都是我给予你的
Then I realised quite what I'd given you.

318
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,490
你疯了
You're insane.

319
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,420
恰恰相反
The opposite.

320
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,580
我清醒得很  我正站在一个应该遭受制裁的男人面前
I am clear. I stand in front of a man that any jury will condemn.

321
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,440
我正站在一个十恶不赦却恩深法弛的男人面前
I stand in front of a man who I allowed to escape a heinous crime...

322
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,640
那是场意外  穆里根
An accident, Mulligan.

323
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,400
我非常有把握...
Be certain of this...

324
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,580
- 我会让你受到应有的制裁  - 够了
- I will see justice. - Enough.

325
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,520
你该回去找你夫人跟女儿了
It is time you returned to your wife and daughter.

326
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,430
你没资格跟我下命令
You're in no position to give me orders.

327
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,520
你唯一能做的就是乞求我不送你进监狱
The only thing you can do is beg not to go to prison.

328
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,550
就算是如此  我也绝不会向你摇尾乞怜
I wouldn't beg you...if my life depended on it.

329
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,240
哦~  J太太
Oh, Mrs J.

330
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,230
你一小时之前就该回去了
You should have gone home hours ago.

331
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,160
我很担心鲍威尔夫人  而你又还在医院  我...
I was worried about Mrs Powell, with you being at the hospital, I...

332
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,070
我觉得应该让你知道这个
I think you should know about this.

333
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,190
对  我知道
Oh, yes.

334
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,140
这是我送给伊丽莎白
I gave this to Elizabeth as a present.

335
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,240
作为结婚纪念日的礼物
An anniversary.

336
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,200
- 我...  - 我知道你在担心什么
- I... - I know what you've been worrying at,

337
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,160
但你的担心是多余的
but...you're wrong.

338
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,130
我觉得你现在该回家了  我们也要睡觉了
Now, I think it's time you went home and we all got some sleep.

339
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,140
好吗
All right?

340
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,010
伊丽莎白
Elizabeth.

341
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,120
我见过穆里根了
I've seen Mulligan.

342
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,200
天呐
Oh, God.

343
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,050
他来过这儿吗  进过我们家吗
Has he been here, in the house?

344
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,170
我得喝一杯了
I need a drink.

345
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,220
奥托
Otto.

346
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,080
奥托  求你
Otto...please.

347
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,100
别喝了
Don't.

348
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,240
我已经受够酒这味道
The smell is enough.

349
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,170
是我杀了格伦  我弄翻了吉普车
I killed Glen. I rolled that Jeep.

350
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,150
正式因为酒精的作用
It was the work of a...drunk.

351
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,000
而后我就骗了你结了婚
Then I trapped us here.

352
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,150
跟我搬到这儿来
In this.

353
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,160
九年了  伊丽莎白
Nine years, Elizabeth.

354
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,190
不  奥托
No, Otto.

355
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,190
你为我跟托马斯所做的事是勇敢而高尚的
What you did for me and Thomas was noble and brave.

356
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,090
穆里根到底想要什么  啊  跟你私通吗
What did Mulligan want, hm? An affair?

357
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,180
他手上有你跟查理的供词  还有案发现场的照片
He has your and Charlie's statements,and photographs.

358
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,120
他知道你们俩都撒了谎
He knows that you both lied.

359
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,180
他知道你们把格伦移到了驾驶座上
He knows you moved Glen to the driver's seat.

360
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,110
那你为什么没告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

361
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,090
我以为自己控制得了他
I thought I could control him.

362
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,010
你以为一旦塞浦路斯的事被公之于众
Do you think you could carry on practising

363
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,110
你还能像现在一样生活吗
if one word of what happened in Cyprus comes out?

364
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,070
我们可以搬去其他地方  重新开始
We can start again, move somewhere.

365
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,160
不然你以为楼上那些钱是用来干嘛的
What do you think all that money upstairs is for?

366
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:15,210
但不一定能像现在这样
Maybe living alongside each other like this was...

367
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,020
相依为命了
..is impossible.

368
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,240
不
No.

369
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,120
不是...
It's...not...

370
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,090
不可能
..impossible.

371
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,160
可是你最近...
But you've changed...

372
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,220
变了
..recently.

373
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,060
我不会让你失望的
I will not let you down.

374
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,150
穆里根到底想要什么  伊丽莎白
What does Mulligan want, Elizabeth?

375
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,200
我觉得他想要我...
I think he wants me...

376
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,150
还有...毁了你
..and to destroy you.

377
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:49,040
赶快  我们要迟到了
Hurry up. We're gonna be late.

378
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,110
吉妮
Jeannie?

379
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,239
你来这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

380
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,439
我想请你喝杯咖啡
I'm buying you a coffee.

381
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,959
不管你愿不愿意
Whether you like it or not.

382
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,110
我要去上班
I've got to go on shift.

383
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,040
现在不行
Not now, you don't.

384
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,190
你们有卡布奇诺吗
You do those cappo-chinos?

385
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,230
没有
No, didn't think so.

386
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,030
那就两杯茶跟一个小面包
Two teas and a bun.

387
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:11,030
你到底想干嘛  吉妮
What's gotten into you, Jeannie?

388
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,090
你是我妹妹  我不关心你谁关心
You're my sister and I don't give a fig who knows it any more.

389
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,400
更何况今天是玛格丽特的葬礼
Besides, it's Margaret's funeral today

390
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,160
而我却半夜就爬起来在想我丈夫究竟在哪儿
and I was up half the night wondering where my husband was.

391
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:22,240
所以我就到这里来了  但没有一个人看见过他
So I came down here, I've been upstairs
and no-one seems to have seen him.

392
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,120
我也想知道那些护士到底要花多久才会换掉那身泳装
I wonder how long those nurses lasted
with their swimming costumes off.

393
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,000
简
Jean.

394
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,040
不必再说了  我已经决定好了
No, I've decided.

395
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,210
你就适可而止吧
Enough is enough.

396
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,170
我敢打赌你肯定也没吃早餐
Bet you haven't had breakfast either.

397
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,180
你的手在发抖呢
Your hand's shaking.

398
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:44,150
安吉  我很好  我得会去工作了  否则他们会...
Ange... I'm fine. I need to get to work or there'll be...

399
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,210
奥托・鲍威尔是个好男人  但他很难猜得透
Otto Powell is a good but very complicated man.

400
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,090
- 你到底在说什么  - 安吉...
- What are you on about? - Ange...

401
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,440
你们这几个月都表现得那么明显了
It's been obvious for months.

402
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,150
我不知道...该怎么办了
I'm not...at all sure what to do.

403
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:02,010
更何况他已经结婚了  再提醒你一下  我也结婚了
Besides, he's married. And, in case you forget, I'm married.

404
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:06,080
我也是  我是结婚了  但这又没见得有多重要
And me, too. I'm married but that doesn't
seem to count for much any more, does it?

405
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,070
人生只有一次  安吉
You only have one life, Ange.

406
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
你要牢记这一点
Remember that.

407
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,290
每次我看见护士长  我就以为自己
Whenever I see Matron, I wonder if I'm in one

408
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:20,090
是电视上克里米亚战争中的英雄
of those television sagas set in the Crimean War.

409
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:25,160
这位是特拉斯科特医生  沃克先生

432
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,160
我想请你帮的忙  我能进来吗

打扫卫生  整理房间

00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,190
我有时候觉得你会嘲笑我  简

443

我不像你一样

我想做一个...

448
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,030
我甚至不知道自己是谁
or even who I am.

449
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:37,160
你和安德伯雷医生不去圣奥尔本对我来说是件好事
You and Dr Enderbury not going to St Albans is good news for me.

454
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:52,120

455
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,140
整理房间开始做起
..and tidying.

456
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,050
你到底想干嘛  简
What did you want, Jean?

457
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,080
我想让你跟我去参加葬礼
I wanted to ask you to come to a funeral.

458
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,220
天呐  谁死了
Gosh. Who's died?

459
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,170
一个朋友
A friend.

460
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,130
我不知道在葬礼上我有没有用
I'm not sure I'd be any use at a funeral.

461
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,110
我也不知道  这还得你自己清楚
I dunno.It might take you out of yourself.

462
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,050
到底出生么事了  莉莉
So, what happened, Lily?

463
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,600
没事  我只是自己搞得乱七八糟了而已
Nothing. I just got rather upside-down, I think. That's all.

464
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,170
你清楚我的为人
You know how I am.

465
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,420
你准备重新要个孩子吗  我希望你能再要一个
Are you going to try for another baby? I'd like you to, you know.

466
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,060
我正在尝试一种新药
I'm on this new pill.

467
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,230
为什么
Why?

468
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,050
- 我...  - 我想要的就只是个孩子而已
- I...- All I want is a child, Jean.

469
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,210
而我只想要一个我能信任的丈夫
And all I want is a husband I can trust.

470
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,000
我想这就是原因吧
That's why, I suppose.

471
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,230
你到底去哪儿了  你先别说话  听我说完
Where the hell have you been? Listen to me.

472
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,130
你还记得塞浦路斯那个军警穆里根警官吗  他到这儿来了
You remember the military policeman from
Cyprus, Sergeant Mulligan? He's here.

473
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,010
- 他来找我们了  - 我知道  查理
- He's onto us. - I know, Charlie.

474
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,210
你说你知道是什么意思
What do you mean you know?

475
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,220
仔细听我说
Listen to me very carefully.

476
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,220
- 我会处理好的   - 怎么处理
- I will handle this. - How?

477
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,220
你要怎么处理
How?

478
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,120
你说你会“处理”是什么意思
What do you mean you will "handle" it?

479
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:46,150
我...不...想进监狱
I am NOT going to prison.

480
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
你是怎么知道的  老兄
How did you know, old boy?

481
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,190
查理
Charlie?

482
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,230
查理
Charlie?

483
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,040
我看见他在医院到处打探消息
I saw him at the hospital, nosing around.

484
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,110
还有谁知道  查理
Who knows, Charlie?

485
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,150
就你跟我  我发誓
Just you and me, I swear.

486
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,130
你打算怎么做
What are you going to do?

487
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,140
放心交给我吧
Leave it to me.

488
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,230
他会保持沉默的
He'll keep quiet.

489
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,040
请进来吧  J太太
Come in, Mrs J, please.

490
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,240
我跟伊丽莎白希望你今天下午能去学校接托马斯
Elizabeth and I would like you to go to
the school this afternoon and fetch Thomas.

491
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:33,040
然后我希望你直接把他接到你父母家里去
And then we would like you to take him straightaway to your parents.

492
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,040
钱都在这儿
Here's some money.

493
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,170
五百英镑
￡500.

494
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,120
托马斯的安全至关重要
Thomas's protection is the most important thing.

495
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,020
几天之后我们会去跟你们会和
In a few days, we'll be in touch.

496
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,180
如果这是件丑闻的话  鲍威尔先生  夫人
If this is a scandal, Mr and Mrs Powell...

497
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:50,080
我们所做的一切都是为了托马斯
Everything we have done...is for Thomas.

498
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,240
天呐  奥托

499
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,150

我感觉现在有点恶心
I feel sick.

501
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,120
别这样
Please.

502
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,150
我觉得我受不起
I don't think I can bear that.

503
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,180
? 你不会将你的手
? Won't you lay your hand

504
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:38,340
? 放在你那救世主的胸膛

505
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,100
? 哦~  我爱你

00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,270
简
Jean...

514
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,180
安德伯雷太太  这是道义支持
Mrs Enderbury...moral support.

515
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,260
无关于品味
There's no accounting for taste.

516
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,170
这到底是谁的葬礼
Whose funeral is this?

517
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,140
? 我赐予你安息

00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,170
感谢你能钱来
Thank you for coming.

524
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,340
我不会对鲍威尔设埋伏的
I wouldn't put an ambush beyond Powell.

525
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,100
别这样说  罗纳尔德
Please, Ronald...

526
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,240
这不是你想要的吗
What is it you want?

527
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
伊丽莎白把一切都告诉我了
Elizabeth's told me what's been going on.

528
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,270
你以她来做饵
You bait the hook with her.

529
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,160
罗纳尔德  听他说吧
Ronald, listen to him.

530
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:19,220
你得停手了  检察长  你听见了吗
This has got to stop,Chief Inspector.Do you hear?

531
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,140
这份自信  这份傲慢  我决不能忍受
The confidence,the arrogance I could never stomach.

532
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,290
你威胁并勒索了伊丽莎白
You have threatened and blackmailed Elizabeth.

533
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,310
我只是告诉了她你对塞浦路斯那件事撒的谎的真相而已
I've only told her the truth about your lies in Cyprus.

534
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,330
她知道你做的那些违法犯纪的事儿吗
Does she know how you go on breaking the law?

535
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,230
还有你是怎样以谎言建立起今日的一切
How your entire existence is based on deceit?

536
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,220
只要病人头脑正常
What patient in...

537
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,140
谁还会去看你这样一个医生
in their right mind would go to a doctor like you?

538
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:42,120
我只需要一句话  这件丑闻就会毁了你
One word from me and the scandal will destroy you.

539
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,130
有本事就去啊  穆里根
Then do it, Mulligan.

540
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,130
但是你永远不可能拥有伊丽莎白
But you will never have Elizabeth.

541
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,170
求你别这样
Please...

542
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,230
- 罗纳尔德  - 不行
- Ronald. - No...

543
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,260
你马上就没机会再扮演上帝的角色了
Suddenly you are no longer playing God.

544
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,330
抱歉  子弹很便宜  但足以杀死我们所有人
Apologies. The bullet is cheap. But we're all the same dead.

545
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,300
你看见了吗
Can't you see?

546
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,310
你看看他
Look at him.

547
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,290
一个双手沾满鲜血的男人
A man whose hands are soaked in blood.

548
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,230
什么也没有
Nothing...

549
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,150
当你拿走钱的时候  哈利街的房子...
when you take away the money, huh, the house...Harley Street.

550
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,200
- 什么也没有  伊丽莎白...  - 奥托没有带枪
- Nothing. Elizabeth... - Otto doesn't have a gun.

551
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,260
看来你比我想象的更愚蠢
Then he's a bigger fool than I thought.

552
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:26,100
你以为会发生什么
What did you think was going to happen?

553
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,180
你在想什么
What are you thinking?

554
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,290
你到底想要什么  鲍威尔
What did you want, Powell?

555
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,250
看在基督的份上  放下枪吧  穆里根
For Christ's sake,put the gun down,Mulligan.

556
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:38,140
不管是什么让你这么坚持  我都给不了你
Whatever it is you're so determined to get, I can't give you.

557
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,280
你想要我的房子还是我的车  统统拿走  那些都是你的
You want my house,my car?Take them,they're yours.

558
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,230
但是伊丽莎白...
But Elizabeth...

559
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,210
带走伊丽莎白吗
Take Elizabeth?

560
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,250
你还不明白吗  她不是我想给就能给的
Don't you understand?She's not mine to give.

561
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,110
- 你的妻子吗  - 伊丽莎白不是我的妻子
- Your wife? - Elizabeth is not my wife.

562
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:00,240
我们只是名义上的夫妻  求你了  告诉他吧
Not in any real sense.Please,just...tell him.

563
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,200
奥托...
Otto...

564
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,290
我娶了伊丽莎白
I married Elizabeth...

565
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,150
因为那是我唯一可以
..because it was the only way I could

566
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,170
拯救那个父亲被我杀害的孩子的方法
save the child whose father I had killed.

567
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,260
你到底在说什么  鲍威尔
What are you talking about, Powell?

568
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,110
别说了  奥托
Please, Otto.

569
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,180
我们的婚姻...只是一项协议
Our marriage...is a pact.

570
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,290
你很清楚这种事
You know better than most.

571
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,310
医生伊丽莎白从塞浦路斯回来  却未婚先孕
If Elizabeth had come back from Cyprus, pregnant, unmarried,

572
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,270
那她会怎么样
what would have happened to her?

573
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,220
她腹中的孩子又会怎么样
To the baby?

574
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,290
托马斯会被带走  被别人收养  而且这个耻辱...
Thomas would have been taken away, adopted, and the shame...

575
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,600
一个没有钱的单身母亲带着一个正在成长的儿子
No money.A single mother with a growing boy.

576
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,260
而且我过发誓...
And I swore...

577
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,190
我会保护她  甚至不让她少一根头发
..that I would protect every fibre of her being.

578
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,210
所以  要是你想要伊丽莎白
So if you want to take Elizabeth...

579
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,300
你得先打穿我的头颅才行
..you have to put a bullet through my head first.

580
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,310
你就是过来告诉我这个
You came to tell me this?

581
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,150
你逼伊丽莎白打电...
You forced Elizabeth to tele...

582
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,190
你还看不出来吗  要是你杀了我...
Can't you see? If you kill me...

583
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,340
带走了伊丽莎白  你觉得会怎么样
..dragging away Elizabeth,what do you think will happen?

584
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,310
什么都不会发生改变
Nothing is going to change.

585
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,340
我就从不应该让你回去
I should never have let you go back, then.

586
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,280
我从不应该...
I should never...

587
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,170
伊丽莎白
Elizabeth...

588
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,230
你想要什么
what do you want?

589
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,150
告诉我你要什么
Tell me what you want.

590
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,250
求你放下枪
Please put down the gun.

591
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,110
不行
No.

592
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,190
不行
No.

593
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,190
够了
Enough.

594
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,130
住手
Enough.

595
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,210
昨天警察都看见过我们在一块儿  他们会去找你的
Policemen saw us together yesterday.They will come after you.

596
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,250
你逼我这样做的
You made me do this.

597
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,330
罗纳尔德
Ronald...

598
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,130
我理解你
I understand you.

599
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,340
我从一开始就知道这种感觉
I felt it the first...first day.

600
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,340
直到后来  甚至当...
And again, even when...

601
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,130
我在一瞬间就失去了托马斯的父亲
I lost Thomas's father in an instant

602
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,130
我的未来自此彻底发生了改变的时候
and my future changed completely.

603
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:56,140
我们的遭遇都相同
We're the same.

604
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,130
你...
You...

605
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,280
跟我
me.

606
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,120
甚至是奥托
Even Otto.

607
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:06,110
但我们得翻过这一页  罗纳尔德
But we go on, Ronald.

608
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,270
我们必须这样做
It's what we must do.

609
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,210
把枪收起来  穆里根
Make the gun safe, Mulligan...

610
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,130
你我自此再无恩怨
..and it ends here.

611
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,290
我到底做了什么
What have I done?

612
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,250
- 我到底怎么了  - 罗纳尔德
- What have I become? - Ronald...

613
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,290
罗纳尔德
Ronald...

614
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:39,130
查理  查理
Charlie! Charlie?

615
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,170
我们必须的杀掉他  奥托
He was going to kill you, Otto.

616
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,330
- 你给他打的什么  - 喷妥撒  从我包拿来的
- What was it? - Pentothal. From the bag.

617
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,280
你用了多少的量  查理
How much did you use, Charlie?

618
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,190
告诉我  用了多少
For Christ's sake, how much?

619
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,330
我车里所有的剂量  你宁愿死在枪下是吗
All I had in the car.You would have preferred a bullet?

620
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,180
伊丽莎白  船坞旁边有个酒馆
Elizabeth, there's a pub by the dock.

621
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,260
- 去那儿叫救护车  - 我是想帮你
- Telephone an ambulance!- I was trying to help you.

622
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,300
伊丽莎白  拜托了
Elizabeth, please!

623
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,250
你根本不知道他究竟对我做过什么
You have no idea what he did to me.

624
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,220
玛格丽特不为男人而活
Margaret didn't live for men,

625
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:30,100
总是把男人之事抛诸脑后  也不用自己的孩子而牺牲
one step behind "her" man,sacrificing everything for her children.

626
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:33,150
她只为自己而活
She lived entirely for herself.

627
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,200
也正是如此  才导致她英年早逝
And it was this that made her burn in our lives.

628
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:44,180
并非她那怪异的幽默感
It wasn't her wicked sense of humour

629
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:48,110
也并非她总是卷入的那些绯闻
or some of the scandals that she was always rather too close to.

630
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,120
但一个像玛格丽特那样知道如何生活的女人
But a woman who knows, as Margaret knew, how to live...

631
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,150
总是会心碎  也总是打破陈规
may break hearts, may break rules...

632
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,280
抱歉  吉妮
I'm sorry, Jeannie.

633
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,310
你为玛格丽特所做的一切...
What you did for Margaret...

634
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,120
对她如此的关怀
..caring for her like that.

635
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,340
我真是个彻彻底底大傻瓜  吉妮
I've been such a bloody fool, Jeannie.

636
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,110
吉妮
Jeannie...

637
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,280
一起走吧
Come on, you.

638
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,240
走了  莉莉
Come on, Lily.

639
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,310
亲爱的  我回来了
Dearest, I'm home.

640
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,170
乔
Joe.

641
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,160
我从丘纳德长官那里得知你失踪了
I heard from the Cunard office that you were missing.

642
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,210
我之前陷入了窘境  仅此而已
I got into a scrape, that's all.

643
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,300
不得不让自己恐惧  你知道吗
Had to make myself scarce, you know?

644
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:34,160
安吉拉  你不戴我们的戒指了吗
Angela, you don't wear our ring?

645
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,100
哦~  护士不被允许结婚的
Oh... Nurses aren't allowed to be married.

646
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:46,190
我一直非常想念你
I have missed you so much.

647
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,160
罗恩
Ron!

648
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:02,180
罗恩
Ron?

649
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,330
他不在这儿  贝蒂
He's not here, Beatty.

650
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,120
确实不在
No.

651
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,190
喝点这个
Here.

652
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,170
应该会让你感觉舒服点
This should help you feel more human.

653
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,310
奥托  我好像怀孕了
Otto, I'm pregnant. I think.

654
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,300
他强奸了我
He forced me.

655
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,150
你为什么没有告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

656
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,260
因为我觉得你会杀了他的
Because I thought you would kill him.

657
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,140
那...那我们该怎么办
So...what should we do?

658
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,240
今晚就做
Tonight.

659
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:44,130
- 不行  我是说...  - 我知道你的意思
- No...I meant...- I know what you meant.

660
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,180
这孩子不能要
No.

661
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,150
求你了  奥托
Please, Otto.

662
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,280
不需要让任何人知道
No-one need know.

663
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:05,300
- 伊丽莎白  - 留下来陪我  奥托  求你了
- Elizabeth... - Stay with me, Otto, please.

664
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:08,260
明天我们就去接托马斯
And tomorrow we can go and fetch Thomas.

665
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:10,280
J太太就可以休息一会儿
I'm sure Mrs J could do with a rest.

666
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:14,150
我们还可以在海边散散心
And we could have a little break down by the sea.

667
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,220
J太太说那里的螃蟹非同寻常
Mrs J tells me the crabs down there are really quite something.

668
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:22,100
特别是海滩酒馆的螃蟹三明治
Crab sandwiches in a pub by the beach.

669
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,220
我觉得那里的天气应该会非常好
I think the weather's set to be lovely.

670
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:32,130
我们要继续下去  奥托
We can go on, Otto.

671
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,160
我需要你
I need you.

672
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,160
