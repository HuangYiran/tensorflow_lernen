在這些男人身上沒能找到DNA
Yeah. We didn't find any DNA on the guys,

142
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,590
但是我們發現了別的東西
but we found something else.

143
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,500
在那里他們檢測到第一個樣本
That's the first sample they pulled.

144
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,250
她所觸及之處  留下的都是一個
Everywhere she touched, there was DNA from a 25-year-old girl

145
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,820
叫妮可·奎斯特的25歲女孩的DNA
Named Nicole Bloomquist,

146
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,080
她三周前在停車場被綁架了
who was abducted three weeks ago from a parking garage.

147
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,140
你是說我們找的這個性愛機器人
Are you telling me the sexbot we're looking for

148
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,580
留下的DNA都是那個姑娘的嗎
is leaving this girl's DNA?

149
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,070
貌似是這樣的
It seems that way.

150
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,600
怎么會
How?

151
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,430
對呀  怎么回事
Correct. How?

152
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,070
坐好咯
Ah, there you go.

153
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,640
很好  很好
Perfect, perfect.

154
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,720
你這個扭來扭去的小討厭
Oh, look at you. Wriggle monster.

155
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,050
來
Okay.

156
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,530
媽媽要把它拿走啦
Mommy'll take it then.

157
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,430
把手給我
Give me your hands,

158
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,750
把臉也擦擦
give me your face.

159
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,900
真漂亮
Beautiful.

160
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,350
又發生了一起綁架案
Another abduction happened.

161
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,940
和妮可·奎斯特案一樣的作案模式
Same M.O. as Nicole Bloomquist.

162
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,130
20多歲女性  停車樓
20-something female, parking structure.

163
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,360
攝像機癱瘓
Cameras were disabled.

164
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,200
所以沒有綁架案的監控錄像
There's no surveillance of the abduction.

165
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,840
而且我又發現了三起新案件
And I found three more missing persons cases

166
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,090
遵循相同的模式
with the same pattern.

167
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,430
也就是說他們先對攝像機下手  再抓人
So, they kill the cams and then take the women.

168
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,220
沒錯  不過這一次他們落了東西
Yeah, except this time, something was left behind.

169
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,180
他當時在車里  他叫維克多
He was in the car. His name is Victor.

170
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,850
我能跟他談談嗎
Can I talk to him?

171
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,490
也許應該由我來談
Maybe I should talk to him.

172
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,020
他不擅長跟孩子交流
He's not good with kids.

173
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,300
-還有貓  -那不是...
-Or cats. - That-that's not...

174
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,270
我可會哄孩子了  真的
I'm great with kids, really.

175
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,470
我是肯尼思警探
I'm Detective Kennex.

176
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,950
你一定就是維克多了  是吧
You must be, uh, Victor, right?

177
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,330
維克多可真是個好名字
Victor's a-a good name.

178
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,180
是一個優秀  堅強的名字
It's a good, strong name.

179
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,490
我知道這很難
Look, I know this must be hard...

180
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,100
但是你一定要勇敢一點  好嗎
But I need you to be brave. Okay?

181
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,830
我需要你告訴我你媽媽遭遇了什么事
I really need you to tell me what happened with your mom.

182
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,750
你喜歡他嗎
You like him?

183
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,550
如果你想要  我可以把他給你
I'll give him to you if you want him.

184
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,130
但是你得保證
But you got to promise me

185
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:18,970
要好好照顧他
to look after him

186
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,720
因為他對我來說很重要
because he means a lot to me.

187
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,710
-我保證  -保證嗎
- I promise. - You promise?

188
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,490
好吧
Okay.

189
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,560
我相信你
I trust you.

190
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,870
聽著  維克多
Look, Victor.

191
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,890
我真的很需要你的幫助
But I really need your help.

192
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,620
需要你告訴我你媽媽遭遇了什么
Need you to tell me what happened with your mom.

193
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,550
你們當時是在一輛車里  是嗎
You guys were in a car, right?

194
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,960
你媽媽走下了車
Your mom got out.

195
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,750
她去扔垃圾了
She went to put the trash away.

196
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,700
然后發生了什么
Then what happened?

197
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,500
我看到了一輛車
I saw the car.

198
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,400
你看到里面有什么人了嗎
Did you see who was in it?

199
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,860
有兩個男人
Two men.

200
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,090
兩個男人
Two men?

201
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,610
之后發生了什么呢
What happened then?

202
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,840
那輛車開走了
The car drove away.

203
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,500
是什么樣的車  什么顏色的
What kind of car was it? What color?

204
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,730
是一輛大大的銀色的車
It was a big, silver car.

205
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,580
一輛大大的銀色的車
A big, silver car.

206
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,220
很好
That's good.

207
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,390
我媽媽什么時候來
When is my mom coming?

208
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,390
維克多
Hey, Victor.

209
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,940
你做的很好
You did really good.

210
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,120
怎么了
What's up?

211
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,950
通過離那個停車場一個街區的交通攝像頭
CSI found the silver sedan

212
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,360
犯罪現場調查員找到了那輛銀色轎車
on a traffic cam a block from the parking structure.

213
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,150
但是追蹤牌照查到的卻是一輛紅色SUV
The license plates tracked back to a red SUV.

214
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,370
他們在用偷來的車牌
They're using stolen plates.

215
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,910
我們找了城里的每一個車牌掃描器
We got every plate scanner in the city

216
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,020
去尋找那些標簽
looking for those tags.

217
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,580
我們會找到那輛車的
We'll find that car.

218
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,660
兩個女孩兒被人用相同的手法劫持
Okay, two girls were abducted with the same M.O.

219
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,490
其中的一個女孩
And one of them,

220
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,060
她的DNA出現在了一個性愛機器人身上
her DNA was found on the sexbot

221
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,190
那個機器人在塞巴斯蒂安·瓊斯被謀殺時
who was with Sebastian Jones

222
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,150
和他在一起
when he was murdered.

223
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,130
我覺得我們得集中注意力
I think we should focus on

224
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,160
去找那個和塞巴斯蒂安在一起的性愛機器人
finding the sexbot that was with Sebastian.

225
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,310
假如我們可以取得她的記憶
If we can access her memory,

226
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,990
我們說不定就可以看見
we might be able to see

227
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,520
那晚酒店里發生了什么
what happened in the hotel that night.

228
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,680
并且確定兇手身份
And identify who did it.

229
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,630
這是我們找到那些失蹤女人的最好機會
That's our best bet for finding the missing women.

230
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,560
各位  我貌似有了一個新角度了
Guys, I might have a new angle.

231
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,540
我徹查了被你們傳喚的那些人
I dug into those summonses you found.

232
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,860
塞巴斯蒂安的前生意伙伴洛倫佐·肖
Sebastian's former business partner Lorenzo Shaw

233
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,410
告他侵犯知識產權
was suing him for intellectual property infringement

234
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,580
{\an8}機器人制造商和前生意伙伴鬧僵
兩人開始打官司

235
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,450
并且剛剛在市中心為自己
and he just opened a sexbot showroom downtown

236
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,410
{\an8}性愛機器人發展新路線公布

237
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,710
開了家性愛機器人展覽廳  這就是動機
for himself-- it's motive.

238
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,980
他可能卷入了這件事
He could be involved.

239
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,660
查清他的底細
Check him out.

240
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,100
你和那個小孩相處得真是驚人的好  約翰
You were surprisingly good with that kid back there, John.

241
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,480
即使你得用個長頸鹿賄賂他
Even though you had to bribe him with a giraffe.

242
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,770
謝謝
Thanks.

243
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,320
你覺得他的媽媽有可能還活著嗎
Do you think his mother is still alive?

244
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,040
我希望如此
I hope so.

245
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,530
她多消失一個小時
Every hour she's gone

246
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,380
就意味著她活著被我們找到的機會少了一分
diminishes the chance of us finding her alive.

247
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,960
當某人死了的時候你怎么跟一個小孩說呢
What do you tell a small child when someone dies?

248
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,900
我從沒想過這個
I've never considered that.

249
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,710
你會怎么跟一個小孩說呢
What you would tell a small child.

250
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,240
你和一個成年人怎么說就和小孩怎么說
Well, you say the same thing that you'd say to an adult.

251
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,810
他們會怎么說
What do they say?

252
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,170
你告訴他們死了的人去了一個更好的地方
You tell them that the person that died has gone to a better place.

253
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,400
為什么大家會這么說
Why would anyone say that

254
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
既然沒有辦法真的知道
when there's no way to really know

255
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,940
人死了之后究竟會去哪
where living things go when they stop living?

256
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,640
這么說可以給人希望和慰藉
It's designed to give hope and comfort.

257
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,440
減輕傷痛
To ease the pain.

258
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,050
人們相信這個因為他們需要相信
People believe it because they need to.

259
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,380
我研究的數據表明
Hmm, the data I've studied suggests

260
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,760
一個人存在過的最好證明
that the best proof of one's existence

261
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,690
就是在他們死后還有人記得他們
is if one is remembered after they're gone.

262
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,760
你搭檔的兒子也是這樣嗎
Was your partner's son told

263
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,890
被告知他的父親去了更好的地方
that his father went to a better place?

264
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,480
不知道
I don't know.

265
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,360
你沒跟搭檔的兒子說過話
You never spoke to your partner's son?

266
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,620
我能理解這對你來說很艱難
I can understand why that would be hard for you.

267
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,360
你們把我兒子怎么了
What did you do with my son?

268
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,130
別擔心
Don't worry.

269
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,930
他應該已經在警方那兒了
The authorities will have him by now.

270
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,060
-你看  我們不是惡人  -我有錢
- You see, we're... we're not monsters. - I have money!

271
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,970
你要什么我都給你
Anything you want, anything.

272
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,250
什么都行
I'll give you anything.

273
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,060
求你了  我只想見到我兒子
Please, I just want to see my son...

274
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,430
我已經得到想要的東西了
I already have what I want.

275
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,310
不  不  不要
No, no, no!

276
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,060
你的前任合伙人  塞巴斯蒂安·瓊斯
Your ex-partner, Sebastian Jones,

277
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,160
你最后一次見他是什么時候
when was the last time you saw him?

278
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,260
六  七個月前
Six months? Seven?

279
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,110
我們最近有點鬧不和
We'd been sort of on the outs lately.

280
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,620
鬧不和
"On the outs"?

281
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,940
你都起訴他了
You were suing him.

282
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,380
我擁有我們在奧瑞立安
I have intellectual property rights

283
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,920
共同創作的產品的知識產權
on designs we developed together at Orillian.

284
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,390
塞巴斯蒂安裸了之后知識產權會怎么處理
What happens to the I.P. rights now that Sebastian's naked?

285
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,950
我是說  他死了之后
Um, I mean "Dead."

286
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,280
現在塞巴斯蒂安已經死了
Now that Sebastian's dead.

287
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,960
知識產權會怎么處理
What happens to the I.P. rights?

288
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,290
他們當然會轉回我的名下
Well, they would naturally revert to me.

289
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,370
這個是你的模特嗎
Is this one of your models?

290
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,870
她不是
No, she's not mine.

291
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,320
這個呢
What about this one?

292
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,750
還有這個
Or this one?

293
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,580
你見過這些女人嗎
You ever seen these women before?

294
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,330
沒見過  但她們不是合成人
No, but they're not synthetics.

295
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,290
-你怎么能確定  -干我這行
- How can you be sure? - In my line of work,

296
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,370
自會知道
you get to know.

297
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,630
我很久沒見過你這種型號了
You know, I haven't seen one of you in a while.

298
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,900
新型性愛機器人上還有點你身上的老技術呢
The latest sexbots have a little bit of your old tech in them.

299
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,150
她們可以與雇主建立情感交流
They're capable of bonding empathetically with their clients.

300
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,950
感知他們的情緒
Sense their moods...

301
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,830
并作出回應
and respond accordingly.

302
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,980
這可是個了不起的成就
It's a significant achievement.

303
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,000
要是你的機器人如此與眾不同
If your bots are so special,

304
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,870
塞巴斯蒂安怎么會欠一屁股債
why was Sebastian so in debt?

305
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,080
要是你了解塞巴斯蒂安  你就會明白了
Well, if you knew Sebastian, you'd understand.

306
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,400
他是個藝術家
He was an artist.

307
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,010
我們發了大財
We were making good money.

308
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,860
但他卻下定決心要研發新的生產線
But he was determined to create the next line.

309
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,370
要青出于藍勝于藍
Better than the last.

310
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,970
他把我們所有的資金都投入到了
He sunk all our capital into

311
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,250
新的生產車間  加工工具和零部件上了
new fabs, tooling, subsystems.

312
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,890
他把整個公司都押上了
He bet the whole company on it.

313
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,360
然后我們最大的客戶終止了合約
And then our biggest client cancelled their contract with us.

314
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,040
讓我們大吃一驚
Took us completely by surprise.

315
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,970
讓我們破產了
Bankrupted us.

316
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,630
你們最大的客戶是誰
Who was your biggest client?

317
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,430
如果你不想說也行
Ah, if you don't want to tell me, that's okay.

318
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,770
我們只要勒令你交出銷售記錄
We'll just subpoena your records.

319
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,630
在我們檢查期間讓你停業幾天
Shut you down for a few days while we go through them.

320
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,870
是一個阿爾巴尼亞財團
It was an Albanian consortium.

321
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,990
他們說正在取締中間商
They said they were cutting out the middle man.

322
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,570
你是說他們找到了新的貨源
You mean they found a new supplier?

323
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,790
似乎是
Apparently.

324
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,750
塞巴斯蒂安不相信會有人制造得出
Sebastian couldn't believe that anyone could build

325
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,110
比我們的更好的性愛機器人
a better sexbot than us.

326
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,030
我給你看的第一張照片
The first picture I showed you.

327
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,250
她屬于那些阿爾巴尼亞人嗎
Did she belong to the Albanians?

328
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,800
塞巴斯蒂安被殺當晚去酒店是因為她嗎
Is she why Sebastian was at the hotel the night he was killed?

329
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,410
我不知道
I wouldn't know.

330
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,900
聽著  我不想再談論這件事了
Look, I-I don't want to talk about this anymore.

331
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,350
他們威脅你了嗎
Did they threaten you?

332
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,300
沒有
No...

333
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,380
他們是很好的客戶  他們總是及時付款
They were good clients. They always paid on time.

334
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,180
關于他們  我就只能透露這些
And that's all I'm gonna say about them.

335
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,780
抱歉  我有顧客來了
Excuse me. I have customers.

336
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,210
肖先生
Mr. Shaw?

337
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,950
你聽過把人類DNA融入進性愛機器人的事嗎
Have you ever heard of people incorporating human DNA into a sexbot?

338
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,610
那是非法的
That's illegal.

339
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,730
我以為你們知道
And I think you know that.

340
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,330
你可以說你不喜歡機器人
You can say you don't like robots all you want.

341
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,630
你的脈搏卻并非如此
Your pulse says otherwise.

342
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,900
什么
What?

343
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,370
準確的說
Precisely.

344
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,810
我想讓你黑進肖的客戶網絡
I want you to hack into Shaw's customer network.

345
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,820
找到那些阿爾巴尼亞人
Find the Albanians.

346
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,020
不需要先拿搜查令嗎
We don't need a warrant?

347
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,490
不需要
I agree.

348
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,790
{\an8}接入網絡

349
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,790
{\an8}搜索阿爾巴尼亞人

350
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,510
找到了
Got it.

351
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,700
五星評價
Five star rating.

352
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,400
有什么計劃
What's the plan?

353
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,650
大干一場
Stir the pot.

354
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,200
{\an8}他們在測試機器人  尋找人類DNA

355
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,990
把手從口袋里拿出來
Hands out of your pockets.

356
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,430
-你見過這個機器人嗎  -沒有
- You seen this bot? - No.

357
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,300
沒見過嗎
No?

358
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,060
-見過這個機器人嗎  -沒有
- Seen that bot? - No, no...

359
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,860
我們測試了所有機器人
We tested all the bots.

360
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,120
全都檢查過了  他們沒問題
They all check out. They're clean.

361
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,640
好的  謝謝
Okay, thanks.

362
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,290
警官們
Officers.

363
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,320
我是經理  有什么事嗎
I'm the manager. Can I help you?

364
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,830
這是你的機器人嗎
Is this one of your bots?

365
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,900
不是
No.

366
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,460
我們這里有很多選擇
We got a great selection here.

367
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,380
{\an8}檢測到心率升高

368
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,980
我們可以給你找一個和這個非常像的
We can get you pretty close to this one.

369
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,930
我們的機器人通過了所有規定測試
Our bots have passed all the required tests.

370
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,680
警察有優惠
Special rate for cops.

371
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,760
我們最喜歡警察了
We love cops.

372
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,940
-是的  我們最喜歡警察  -很好
- Yeah. We love cops. - Well, great.

373
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,650
如果你能回答我的全部問題
If you answer all of my questions,

374
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,730
也許我能讓你們邁出成功的第一步
maybe I'll let you get to first base.

375
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,190
你從塞巴斯蒂安·瓊斯和
You ever buy from Sebastian Jones

376
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,140
洛倫佐·肖那里買過機器人嗎
and Lorenzo Shaw?

377
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,300
以前買過
We used to.

378
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,140
-不過現在不買了  -為什么不買了
- Not anymore. - Why'd you stop?

379
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,370
我們現在自己做了
We make our own now.

380
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,530
你確定這不是你們做的嗎
And you're sure that's not one of them?

381
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,460
說過了
Already said.

382
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,490
約翰
John.

383
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,910
斯塔警探有事和我們說
Detective Stahl needs to talk to us.

384
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,320
謝謝  先生們
Thank you, gentlemen.

385
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,500
他的體征表明他在說謊
His vitals suggest that he is lying.

386
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,380
沒錯
Yup.

387
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,800
或者是他不怎么喜歡你
Or he doesn't like you very much.

388
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,110
把他列為我們的嫌疑人
Add him to the list of kids and cats.

389
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,370
有銀色轎車的線索了
We got a hit for the silver sedan.

390
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,060
那輛在停車場綁走克里斯汀·黑斯曼的車
The one that kidnapped Kristen Haseman in the parking garage.

391
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,130
我們在一個車牌掃描器上發現了它的蹤跡
We picked it up on a plate scanner.

392
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,570
多里安  仔細看它經過掃描器的瞬間
Dorian, watch the sedan as it goes past the scanner.

393
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,610
車牌變了
The license plate changes.

394
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,010
他們用了跟蹤擾頻器
They're using a tag scrambler.

395
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,330
我們一發現這個
Once we realized that,

396
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,950
就直接改用監視攝像頭
we switched to straight surveillance cams

397
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,110
并且跟蹤它到了第八街的一座工廠
and tracked it to an industrial facility off 8th Street.

398
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,580
他們在那兒做什么
What were they doing there?

399
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,710
不知道  他們停留了20多分鐘
I don't know, they were there for 20 minutes,

400
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,950
然后我們跟丟了他們
and then we lost 'em.

401
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,870
好吧  我們三分鐘左右后到那里
All right, we're three minutes out.

402
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,560
那是什么
What the hell is that?

403
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,070
是克里斯汀·黑斯曼嗎
Is that Kristen Haseman?

404
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,700
這不是人類
It's not human.

405
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,460
{\an8}識別對象
匹配  不明  性愛機器人

406
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,360
這是賓館里的那個機器人
This is the android from the hotel.

407
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,050
要是他們就這么處理他們的性愛機器人
If this is what they're doing to their sexbots,

408
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,630
可想而知  他們會如何對待被他們綁架來的女子
imagine what they're doing to the women they've abducted.

409
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,680
迷人的綠色
Beautiful green.

410
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,290
他們把顏色調得剛剛好
They really have got the color just right.

411
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,680
你看  這幾槍打得相當精確
You see, these shots were targeted precisely

412
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,410
徹底破壞了皮質繼電器和存儲中心
to shatter the cortical relays and storage centers.

413
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,180
他們毀壞了她的記憶
They destroyed her memory.

414
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,380
是的  他們要確保沒人能恢復她所記錄的
Yeah, they wanted to ensure no one could retrieve

415
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,240
關于殺害塞巴斯蒂安·瓊斯的兇手的記憶
her recorded memories of Sebastian Jones' murder.

416
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,540
這些白化變種知道他們在做什么
These albinos knew exactly what they were doing.

417
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,980
阿爾巴尼亞人
Albanians.

418
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,850
這樣說更合理
Well, that, that would make more sense.

419
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,810
不過還有一絲機會
But there is a small chance that her

420
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,780
她的顳骨外殼可能沒被徹底損壞
temporal housing might be intact enough

421
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,800
還能找回一些聲象記憶
to salvage some of her echoic memory.

422
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,900
她或許能告訴我們
Uh, she might still be able to tell us

423
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,150
那些人這么做的原因
something about the people that did this.

424
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,040
抱歉  朋友
Apologies, mate.

425
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,750
我習慣一個人單獨做這些
I'm used to being alone when I do this.

426
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,660
你們可能不忍直視
You might want to look away.

427
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,920
沒關系
It's fine.

428
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,960
他們為什么把它的皮膚剝掉
Why did they peel its skin off?

429
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,610
顯而易見  他們也不想讓我們看到她的皮
Well, they obviously didn't want us to see that either.

430
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,640
讓我想想
Wait a minute,

431
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,480
賓館里的監控錄像里
the surveillance footage at the hotel.

432
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,960
她的手留下的痕跡顯示是人類的DNA
Her hands left traces of human DNA.

433
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,620
你覺得他們綁架那些姑娘是為了采集她們的皮膚
You think they're abducting the girls to harvest their skin.

434
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,830
要是用人類皮膚
If you used human skin,

435
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,670
就可以造出市場上最高端的性愛機器人
you'd make the best sex machines on the market.

436
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,290
塞巴斯蒂安查出了這些
I think Sebastian found out about it.

437
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,390
因此他們才殺了他
That's why they killed him.

438
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,600
性愛機器人  約炮機器人
Sex machine, bang bot?

439
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,890
真是目光短淺  不是嗎
It's a bit myopic, isn't it?

440
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,620
不是所有找性愛機器人的人都是為了做愛
Not everyone who visits a sexbot is looking for sex.

441
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,050
有些人只是去聊天
Some people go for the conversation

442
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,350
或是結束了一天應付各種有事相求的人
or for a sympathetic ear at the end of a long working day

443
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,340
所帶來的疲憊工作之后
surrounded by people who only ever come to visit

444
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,990
去尋求一絲慰藉
when they want something from you.

445
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,130
我是說
I'm just saying that, uh,

446
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,250
神經接口是相當精細的
the neural interface is quite sophisticated.

447
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,930
總之  看上去他們用被綁架的女子的DNA
Anyway, it appears they're growing skin using DNA

448
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,430
來培養皮膚組織
from the abducted women.

449
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,590
合成的皮膚
Well, synthetic skin,

450
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,730
就算再逼真  和真的相比還差很多
as good as it is, is a long way from the real thing.

451
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,720
還要加入能增加吸引力的
There are pheromones and other biological features

452
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,290
信息素以及其他的生物特性
that trigger attraction.

453
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,900
就是這里
Here it is.

454
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,150
抱歉  損壞得太嚴重了
Sorry, it's too damaged.

455
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,000
如果你們想知道這些機器人從哪里來
If you want to know where these bots are coming from,

456
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,490
我需要研究一個活著的
I'm going to have to get my hands on a live one.

457
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,160
你知道我的意思
So to speak.

458
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,890
你很安靜
You're quiet.

459
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,280
發生什么事了
What's wrong?

460
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,960
看著魯迪工作臺上的那個機器人
Just looking at that bot on Rudy's table

461
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,050
不禁讓我思考
makes me think,

462
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,800
誰會記得我呢
who is going to remember me?

463
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,220
你是警察
You're a cop.

464
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,920
你幫助過的人們將會永遠記得你
The people you help will remember you,

465
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,830
不管你的名字是什么
whatever your name is.

466
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,180
說到名字
Speaking of names,

467
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,580
剛剛有人回復了你的交友檔案  約翰
someone just responded to your dating profile, John.

468
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,600
我的交友檔...
My dating pro...

469
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,380
-我以為你開玩笑的  -我是認真的
- I thought you were kidding. - Not kidding.

470
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,650
我看到了你盯著性愛機器人的饑渴眼神
I saw the way you were looking at those sexbots.

471
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,930
你的交友名字是...
Your profile name is...

472
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,660
理查德醫生
Dr. Richard.

473
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,340
-理查德醫生  -喜歡乳蛋餅
- Dr. Richard. - Who likes quiche,

474
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,430
喜歡在沙灘漫步
long walks on the beach,

475
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,510
-和爵士樂  -你居然叫我理查德醫生
- smooth jazz. - You seriously did not call me Dr. Richard.

476
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,590
我以為你想找人約會
I thought you wanted to meet someone.

477
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,520
我跟不少女人在約會  不用你幫我
I meet plenty of women. I don't need your help.

478
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,700
我運行了一次身體掃描
I-I ran a bio scan,

479
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,560
看起來你的睪丸已經快飽和了
and it looked like your testicles were at full capacity.

480
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,370
你居然掃描了我的蛋蛋
You're scanning my balls?

481
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,990
-我也不喜歡這樣  只是  -老天
- I didn't enjoy it, I just... - Oh, my God,

482
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,690
-真不可思議  -我實在沒法不注意到
- This is unbelievable. - I can't help but notice

483
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,610
...你的滿腔欲火
you're backed up.

484
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,570
你是有什么毛病
What is the matter with you?

485
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:30,730
再也不準掃描我的睪丸了
Don't scan my testicles ever again.

486
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,040
收到
Copy that.

487
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,370
她長得什么樣子
What does she look like?

488
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,360
你希望她是什么樣子
What do you want her to look like?

489
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,370
深邃的褐色眼睛
Brown eyes, soulful.

490
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,630
身高呢
Height?

491
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,580
一般身高就好
Average height.

492
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,380
我喜歡褐發女人
I like brunettes.

493
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,840
你希望跟相同職業的女人約會
Would you date anyone in your profession

494
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,090
還是與你不同職業的
or would you prefer to date someone outside of it?

495
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,700
兩種都行
Sure, either way.

496
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,870
我喜歡有智慧的女人  比我更聰明的
I like smart women, you know, women that are smarter than me.

497
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,470
那不是件難事
That won't be hard.

498
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,020
你知道你描述的正是斯塔警探吧
You are aware that you just described Detective Stahl, right?

499
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,380
肯尼思
Kennex.

500
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,850
我們發現你要找的銀色轎車了
Hey, we got a 20 on the silver sedan you posted.

501
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,680
我剛將資料傳給了多里安
I just uploaded it to Dorian.

502
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,190
好的...  謝謝你...
Uh, okay, thank you, um,

503
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,130
斯塔警探  謝謝
Detective Stahl, thanks.

504
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,410
-好的  謝謝你  斯塔警探  -閉嘴
- Okay, thank you, Detective Stahl. - Shut up.

505
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,770
閉嘴  別鬧了
Shut it, zip it.

506
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,560
警察
Police!

507
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,580
不許動
Don't you move!

508
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,740
雙手放在儀表盤上
Put your hands on the dashboard! Hands on the dash!

509
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,050
-放在那別動  -不準動
- Hold 'em, keep 'em there! - Do not move!

510
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,890
把你雙手放在儀表盤上我能看見的地方
Put your hands on the dashboard now where I can see 'em!

511
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,280
轉過身來
Turn around, turn around!

512
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,420
走出車外
Step out of the car.

513
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,380
快點
Come on.

514
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,750
到前面來
Around front.

515
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,290
你好  我是瓦內薩
Hi, I'm Vanessa.

516
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,840
你好嗎
Hey, how you doing?

517
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,940
我需要取一份DNA樣本
I need to take a DNA sample.

518
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,610
請張開嘴
Open your mouth, please.

519
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,660
為什么
Why?

520
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,530
我已經通過所有測試了
I've passed all my tests.

521
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,290
請
Please.

522
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,710
{\an8}身份信息  發現匹配
羅琳·懷特

523
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,930
她的DNA屬于羅琳·懷特
Her DNA belongs to a Lorraine White,

524
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,250
兩個月前在圣克萊爾的一個停車場被綁架
Abducted from a parking structure two months ago in St. Clair.

525
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,660
實驗室
Lab.

526
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,720
魯迪
Rudy,

527
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,730
找了些皮膚給你
found you some skin.

528
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,190
阿爾巴尼亞人不會告訴我們
The Albanians aren't telling us

529
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,760
綁架案受害者在哪里
where the kidnap victims are.

530
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,340
我們得從性愛機器人那里弄到消息
We need to get that information from a sexbot.

531
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,460
現在有三個女孩失蹤  也許更多
We have three missing girls out there somewhere, maybe more.

532
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,470
我會盡我所能挖出信息
I'll pull everything I can from it.

533
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,330
又見面了
Hello again.

534
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,610
一個人類的DNA被用來制造你的皮膚
A human's DNA was used to make your skin.

535
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,900
這個女人
This woman.

536
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,400
我們要找到她
We need to find her.

537
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,230
我們時間不多
We don't have much time.

538
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,680
你之前見過她嗎
Have you seen her before?

539
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,760
沒有
No.

540
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,630
我要你好好想想
I need you to think.

541
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,150
這很重要
It's really important.

542
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,970
那你見過她嗎
Have you seen her?

543
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,190
沒有
No.

544
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,240
你是在哪里被造出來的
Where were you made?

545
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,120
你的主人是誰
Who owns you?

546
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,500
你知道你在哪里出生的嗎
Do you know where you were born?

547
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,030
你跟這個姑娘共事過嗎
You ever worked with this girl?

548
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,560
沙琳
Charlene.

549
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,170
沒錯  沙琳
Right, Charlene.

550
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,980
你知道她在哪里出生的嗎
Do you know where she was born?

551
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,490
誰是你的主人
Who owns you?

552
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,210
她可能不太懂這些字眼
She's probably not conscious of those terms.

553
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,540
這些人今晚要帶你去哪兒
Where were those men taking you tonight?

554
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,070
他們要帶我去兜風
They were taking me for a ride.

555
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,490
我們認為他們要帶你去毀掉
We think they were taking you to be destroyed.

556
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,700
為什么會有人想毀掉我
Why would anybody want to destroy me?

557
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:21,940
跟我可以做遠比這更加有趣的事
There are much, much better things to do with me.

558
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,520
如果你不想  我們也可以什么都不做
We don't have to do anything if you don't want to.

559
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:29,640
我是個很好很好的傾聽者
I'm a very, very good listener.

560
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:33,060
知道嗎  人們會用不同的方式尋找聯系
You know, people look for connections in different ways.

561
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,120
但所有人都想找的
That's all people are looking for,

562
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,430
其實是一個關心他們的人
is someone who cares about them.

563
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,410
我就是為此而生的
That's what I'm here for.

564
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,080
你知道沙琳在哪兒嗎
Do you know where Charlene is?

565
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,150
是的
Yes.

566
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,500
我能見見她嗎
Can I see her?

567
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,490
為什么想見她
Why do you want to?

568
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,460
我不知道
I don't know.

569
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,010
你被設計成與人親近的機器人
You were designed to bond with people.

570
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,310
你被開發出來就是這個目的
That's what you were developed to do.

571
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,680
他們在的時候關注他們
To notice when they're there.

572
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,270
這意味著他們不在的時候你也會關注
That also means you notice when they're not there.

573
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,530
所以你想要見她
That's why you want to see her.

574
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,720
這是你的感覺
That's what you're feeling.

575
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,840
誰讓你跟今晚那個男人走的
Who told you to go with the men we found you with tonight?

576
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,410
尤里
Yuri.

577
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,230
你認識尤里嗎
Do you know Yuri?

578
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,800
嗯  我們認識尤里
Yeah, we know Yuri.

579
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,710
清空場所
Clear the area.

580
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,490
我負責樓上
I'm going upstairs.

581
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,930
閃開
Move!

582
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,950
該走了

583
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,990
丟棄所有東西

584
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,930
毀掉實驗室

585
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,260
他們會死的

586
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,770
他們還能生成很多皮膚

587
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,130
我們會在其他地方建實驗室的

588
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,340
我們走

589
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,430
你先上
You go first.

590
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,600
他們不在這
They're not here.

591
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,500
不是這棟樓
This isn't the right building.

592
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,440
辦公室也沒人
Office is empty, too.

593
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,120
我想我能找到那間皮膚實驗室
I think I can find the skin lab.

594
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,020
-魯迪  -在  多里安
- Rudy? - Yes, Dorian?

595
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,620
這種性愛機器人大部分
Most of these sexbots are platformed

596
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,960
具有老式尤朱諾學習模塊
on an old ujuno pendant learning module.

597
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,820
沒錯  DRN機器人停止使用那些模塊以后
Uh, yeah, uh, those modules were available

598
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,770
它們就流入了公共市場
to the public sector once we stopped using them on the DRNs.

599
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,980
停用是因為那些模塊會發出
Problem was that they were giving off

600
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,430
多余的GPS信號
an unwanted GPS signal.

601
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,370
對  這是副作用
Yeah, it was an unwanted side effect.

602
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:39,810
所以每次他們自動更新軟件時
Um, whenever they, uh, automatically updated their software,

603
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,700
就會無意中
they'd inadvertently

604
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,350
發出信號從而讓相關人員對其追蹤
send out a signal allowing those so inclined to, uh, track you.

605
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,760
有這樣的記錄嗎
Is there a log of that?

606
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,800
肯定有
I'm sure there is.

607
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,430
你能讀取瓦內薩的內部GPS記錄
Can you access Vanessa's internal GPS log

608
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,980
查看模塊第一次發出信號是什么時候嗎
to find the very first time that the module sent a signal?

609
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,990
應該可以
It's possible.

610
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,620
如果我們能找到她第一次激活的時間
If we can find out the first time she was activated,

611
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,070
-就能找到...-她"出生"的地方
- we can find... - Find out where she was born.

612
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,550
皮膚實驗室
The skin lab.

613
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,000
好  稍等一下
All right, bear with me.

614
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,210
很快就好
I won't be a minute.

615
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,360
快看
Oh. Look at that.

616
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,850
這是那個充電器  當我沒說
That's the charger for my-- doesn't matter.

617
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,430
找到了
Um, here we go.

618
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,990
就是這個
This is the one I need.

619
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,760
好吧  你好
Right. Uh, hello.

620
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,840
我需要連接你的數據端口
I need to access your data port.

621
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,970
這聽起來有點無禮
That sounds rude. Um,

622
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,510
我需要插入我的...天啊  更糟糕了
I need to insert my... Oh, that's even worse.

623
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,980
溫柔地
Um... Oh, friendly.

624
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,780
與性愛無關  我保證
Um, it's nothing sexual, I assure you.

625
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,600
我不是說性愛有什么錯
Not that there's anything wrong with sex.

626
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,750
我是說  誰不喜歡性呢
I mean, who doesn't like sex?

627
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,410
不是說我
Not me.

628
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,930
我是說我喜歡  這才是重點
I mean, I do. That's-that's the point.

629
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:36,960
但這就有點
But that would be,

630
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,490
不合時宜了
um, inappropriate at best.

631
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,000
不會疼的  我向你保證
This is not gonna hurt, I promise you.

632
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,560
好了
There we go.

633
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,940
好
Right.

634
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,430
只要...
Just, um...

635
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,440
看看你的...
Having a look at your, uh...

636
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,180
數據記錄
statistics.

637
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,890
{\an8}金士頓高地

638
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,000
看來你第一次被激活的地點是金士頓高地
Looks like you were first activated in Kingston Heights.

639
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,230

放下武器  把武器放下
Drop that weapon! Drop it, you!

648

放下武器
Drop the weapon!

649
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,750
別開槍  趴在地上
Don't shoot! On the ground! Now!

650

668
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,750
只是個玩笑
It's just a... It's a joke, you know.

669
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,860
我有很多女人
I get a lot of women.

670
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,990
也不是很多  只是
I mean, not a lot-- you know, just...

快寫完了
Uh, yeah, almost.

681
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,940
在摧毀機器人時
We'll need individual certificates

682
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,550
我們需要單獨的證書 知道嗎
when the bots are destroyed. Okay?

683
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,280
知道了
Okay.

684
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,730
抱歉
I'm sorry.

685

你記得約翰·肯尼思嗎

他曾是你爸爸的搭檔
He was your dad's partner.
