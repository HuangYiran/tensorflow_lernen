完事了我们再谈
We'll talk after it's done.

65
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:49,987
你把这事交给州警办？
You handle this with the sheriffs?

66
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:52,598
还是把联邦调查局的人搬过来？
Or you bring in Feds and local?

67
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:54,604
这你就不用操心
That's none of your concern.

68
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:17,071
那样有用吗？
Think that helped?

69
00:04:18,863 --> 00:04:20,500
我不知道
I don't know.

70
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:24,280
至少我们尝试过了

她现在睡着了
Well, she's asleep now.

74
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:42,440
你在帮她做这一切？
You know, all this stuff you're doing for her?

75
00:04:42,577 --> 00:04:44,091
很好 很好
Great. Great.

76
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,867

Wendy必须靠自己戒毒

00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,406
一会我打几个电话
I'll make the calls.

80
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:03,541
我们以前关系不太好 我和她
We have rough history, me and her.

81
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:07,195
我只是想去帮帮她 而不是害她
I was just trying to help her more than hurt her.

82
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,563
嗯
Mm.

83
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:10,445
作为一种改变吧
For a change.

84
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:24,258
嗨 你认为这种宽容是否
Hey, you think any of this mercy might ever be able

85
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,089
也能用到Tara身上？
to spill over into Tara's cup?

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,210
她可是你亲孙子的老妈 Gem
She's the mother of your grandson, Gem.

87
00:05:32,628 --> 00:05:35,217
这种关系永远都改变不了的
Come on, that shit ain't never gonna change.

88
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,195
我做不到
I can't go there.

89
00:05:39,276 --> 00:05:41,679
哦 明白 那种深深的....
Oh. See, that deep...

90

我理解 嗯
I get it, uh-huh.

91
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:45,925
我明白那种感觉
I know it.

92
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:50,722
我的前妻--那婆娘在她怀孕的时候一直注射毒品
My ex-- that bitch was shooting
junk the whole time she was pregnant.

93
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:56,368
导致Lucius一辈子的痛苦
And the pain that Lucius has to live with...

94
00:05:57,176 --> 00:05:59,404
都是她造成的
that's on her. Okay?

95
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:04,228
我..我对她咬牙切齿
and I-I can chew that hate that I feel for her.

96
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:08,432
她死了
She's dead.

97
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:10,148
你没有
You're not.

98
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:13,086
是啊 但是我还得承受这种痛苦
Yeah, but I-I'm the one that's
still got to live with all that shit.

99
00:06:16,104 --> 00:06:21,000
都是因为在她活着的时候 我做得不够好
'Cause I never made it right when she was alive.

100
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,144
我不能原谅她 Nero
I can't forgive her, Nero.

101
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,361
至少现在不行
Not now.

102
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:38,584
好吧
Okay.

103
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,530
好吧
Okay.

104
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:45,537
孤独地骑行在这尘世
Riding through this world  all alone 

105

上帝将灵魂带走
God takes your soul 

106
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:51,554
徒剩躯壳
You're on your own

107
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,750
如乌鸦掠过天际
The crow flies straight

108
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,385
直飞远方
a perfect line

109
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,349
缠绵在恶魔之床
on the devil's bed

110
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:03,469
直至死亡
until you die 

111
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:08,053
才将这一世的轨迹
Gotta look this life 

112
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:10,952
看个端详
in the eye

118

不介意照看一会吧？
Would you mind watching them for a bit?

119
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:52,705
很明显 我不准把他们再放到日托所了
Apparently, I'm not allowed to take them to day care anymore.

120
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,622

123
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:00,648

很遗憾 发生这么多糟糕的事

我知道你是好意的
I know your heart was in the right place.

131
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:28,803
遗憾的是 我的好意没人在乎
Unfortunately, where my heart is matters very little.

132
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:36,492
她看上去很难过
She seems really sad.

133
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:39,546
确实有很多难过的事
Lot of that going around.

134
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:43,528
很难有转机了 不是吗？
It's not gonna get any better, is it?

135
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:45,691
今天肯定不行 Chucky
Not today, Chucky.

136
00:10:25,395 --> 00:10:28,481
Lowen把情况都告诉了我 不管是正式的还是非正式的
Lowen brought me up to speed on

Good.

138
00:10:29,831 --> 00:10:33,192

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,855
我正在进行离婚和监护人的文字工作
I'm prepared to execute the divorce and custody paperwork,

143
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:48,656
但是你要知道这其中的风险 Knowles医生
but you need to understand the risk here, Dr. Knowles.

144
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:51,250
这些关于你丈夫的材料？
These transcripts about your husband?

145
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:53,781
如果我们利用这些材料来争取你孩子的监护权
If we use them to get custody of your boys,

146
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:56,404
他将有权告诉他的律师
he'll have the right to tell his side of it.

147
00:10:57,218 --> 00:10:58,922
让它成为公开资料
Makes it public record.

148
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,332
而地方检察官就可以在Pamela Toric的案子上加以利用
The DA can use that in the Pamela Toric trial.

149
00:11:03,638 --> 00:11:05,263
那会产生什么后果？
And what does that do?

150
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:08,711
我们最大的优势是信誉
The biggest part of our defense is your credibility.

151
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,980
如果地方检察官发现流产的事情有可疑之处
If the DA finds out about the doubts regarding the

152
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,945
他们会努力发掘真相
miscarriage, they'll dig in to get the truth.

153
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:21,951
如果他们发现什么对我们不利的....
If what they find comes back unfavorable...

154
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:25,028
我们就输了
I lose my defense.

155
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,977
那么说 我不得不做个选择
So I have to choose?

156
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,011
要孩子还是要自由？
My boys or my freedom?

157
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:34,761
这两样都不能确保
There's no guarantee of either.

158
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,444
但是 基本上 是的 这就是现实
But essentially, yes,I guess that's true.

159
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,044
先生们
Gentlemen.

160
00:11:55,222 --> 00:11:57,170
这些是为我们准备的？
 These for us?
是的
 Aye.

161
00:11:57,824 --> 00:12:00,029
只是为了确保不被人查到
Just making sure they're untraceable.

162
00:12:00,634 --> 00:12:02,094
只要确保能开动就行
Just make sure they run.

163
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:04,157
当然 把油箱都加满了
They do. Even filled the tanks.

164
00:12:04,254 --> 00:12:06,318
Tig 检查一下
Tig, check 'em.
行 没问题
Yeah, you got it.

165
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:08,874
West Quinn 跟我来
West, Quinn, come on.
Gaalan在哪？
Where's Gaalan?

166
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:10,547
他会在机库和我们碰头
He's meeting us at the hangar.

167
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:12,840
那里就是我们为Clay储存了枪支的地方
That's where we're storing the guns for Clay.

168
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:15,325
Gaalan和货一起？
Gaalan bringing the shipment with him?

169
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:18,489
搞定之后 我和Hugh去放货的地方
After the takedown, me and Hugh will go to the barn,

170
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:21,355
把货拿上 我们再到机库碰面
we'll pick it up, we'll meet you at the hangar.

171
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:23,934
这就是你的帮手吗？
Is he all you got?

172
00:12:24,558 --> 00:12:26,056
我能对付
I'm all you need.

173
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:29,727
我们让Neil在监狱外面望风
We got Neil positioned outside the prison.

174
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:31,560
他是我们了解路上情况的耳目

175
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:35,984
那么 我们该怎样行动？
So, how we doing this?

176

我来详细给你们解释一下

177
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,278
叫上Tig
Get Tig.

178
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:41,576

各位 去帮帮忙

我们了解了路线、人员和运输车辆的情况

行动将会简单 干净 利落
It'll be clean, fast and easy.

183
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:56,667
我们需要用到50口径的家伙？
We're going to need .50-cals?

184
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:59,111
我们必须要打穿防弹玻璃
We'll be having to smash through some bulletproof glass.

185
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:00,878
这算是简单利落吗？
Is that the fast or the easy part?

186
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,502
我以前干过 小伙子

在Armagh的地方监狱

不同颜色 不同分工

199

每量车配两人

我们停下来等着
We park and we wait.

202
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,789
有很多车来来往往 所以不会引起别人注意
Lots of trucks are coming and going,
so it'll look like business as usual.

203
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:46,560
一旦接到目标靠近的电话

222
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:46,561
这帮爱尔兰人不会乖乖的束手就擒
The Irish aren't going to go down without a fight.

223
00:16:46,646 --> 00:16:48,608
我们有3个战术分队准备包围他们
We've got three tacticals ready to close in.

224
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:50,495
要是他们负隅顽抗 就太蠢了
They resist, they're fools.

225
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:55,350
你认为行动会不妙？
How do you think this goes down?

要想不妙都很难
Only one way it can go down.

228

瞧瞧我的乖孩子

235
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:55,856

I'm thinking I'm going to take the boys over there.

236
00:17:57,306 --> 00:17:59,338
让她看看Abel 可能对她比较好

238

他将来迟早会知道 谁是他的亲生妈妈
He's going to find out sooner or later who his mom really is.

240
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:08,918
他也一样
So is he.

241
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,827
是啊
Yeah.

242
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,877
确实是这样
I guess that's true.

243
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,576
我帮Tara的事...
Me helping Tara--

244
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:22,319
你应该知道 都是为了他们
you do know it was all about them.

245
00:18:23,962 --> 00:18:25,543
我明白
I know.

246
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:28,851
这仍然是个大问题
Which is still the case.

247
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:35,726
要是Tara一走了之 那就出大麻烦了
If Tara gets off, all this shit that's gone down,

248
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:38,351
但是她还是他们的妈妈
she's still their mom.

249
00:18:39,044 --> 00:18:40,687
你认为如何？
What does that look like?

250
00:18:42,193 --> 00:18:44,333
那要Jax做决定
That's Jax's call.

251
00:18:45,229 --> 00:18:48,119
如果真的要她离开 他俩怎么办？
And if she goes away,what happens to them?

252
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:52,488
别说那些俱乐部或者大家庭之类的废话
And don't give me all that club and family rhetoric.

253
00:18:52,606 --> 00:18:55,300
我说的是 长此以往怎么办 Gemma
I'm talking about the day-to-day of it, Gemma.

254
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,863
谁来照顾他们？
Who takes care of them?

255
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:58,540
我来
I do.

256
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,367
真的？
Really?

257
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,313
你觉得你能胜任吗？
You think you're up to that?

258
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,129
你是说我太老了？
You saying I'm too old?

259
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,843
我是说一个奶奶和一个妈妈的角色是不同的
I'm saying being a grandma and-and
being a mom are two different jobs.

260
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,939
我知道责任重大 Wayne
I'm aware of the burden, Wayne.

261
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:15,923
来吧 宝贝
Come here, baby.

262
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:17,288
好了 小宝贝
There we go.

263
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:22,864
对于那些人的责任呢？
What about the burden on them?

264
00:19:23,086 --> 00:19:26,155
我是说Opie、半袋、Phil
Opie, Half-Sack, Phil--

265
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:28,405
他们也是别人的儿子
they were all somebody's sons.

266
00:19:28,503 --> 00:19:30,892
假如他们的妈妈有机会重来一次
If their mothers had a chance to do it over again,

267
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:32,993
引导他们走向不同的方向
lead them in a different direction...

268
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,801
这世上没后悔药可吃 Wayne
There are no second chances, Wayne.

269
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:39,908
我们只有一次机会 去爱孩子 把他们养大成人
We get one shot at loving and raising our kids.

270
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:43,531
我会把这事干好
And I'm going to do this right.

271
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,528
我不怀疑你能把孩子们养大
I have no doubt that you could raise these boys.

272
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,053
我知道你很爱他们
I know how much you love them.

273
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:58,145
但是你必须意识到 现在不是1967年的那个时候了 亲爱的
But you got to realize this isn't 1967 anymore, sweetheart.

274
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:01,954
现在的世界 不再罗曼蒂克或者崇尚自由
This life, it ain't romantic or free.

275
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:05,980
很多事情变得不可理喻
There's no path to anything that makes any sense.

276
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:09,563
这世道肮脏而悲惨
It's just dirty and sad.

277
00:20:11,415 --> 00:20:14,508
我们都心知肚明 情况会变得更糟
And we both know it's only going to get worse.

278

Well... I mean, the smart plan

495
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:33,436
把这事说成是关系恶化了

 两个家伙以前有些过节

听上去不错

00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,131
他没事吧？
He gonna make it?

560
00:44:18,302 --> 00:44:20,472
嗯 应该没事
Aye, think so.

561
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:24,999
Gaalan在办公室里面？
- Gaalan in the office?
是的
- Yeah.

562
00:44:25,092 --> 00:44:26,928
需要帮忙把那些枪卸下来吗？
You, uh, need help unloading the guns?

563
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,665
多谢
- I appreciate it.
嗯 没事
- Yeah, sure.

564
00:44:35,268 --> 00:44:38,102
老天
Mother of Christ.

565
00:44:42,577 --> 00:44:44,402
哦 天啊
Aw, Jesus.

566
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,839
当心点....兄弟
Easy... brother.

567
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:57,958
我来告诉你怎么回事
Let me tell you what happened here.

568
00:45:06,771 --> 00:45:11,075
Clay 和 Gaalan有些私下的交易
Clay and Gaalan had some kind of side deal.

569
00:45:12,988 --> 00:45:15,781
后来情况恶化 他们开始争执起来
It went bad. They started arguing.

570
00:45:17,283 --> 00:45:20,145
Clay开枪杀了Gaalan
Clay shot Gaalan.

571
00:45:20,899 --> 00:45:22,533
你们的人冲进来
Your men ran in.

572
00:45:22,996 --> 00:45:24,968
Clay也把他们放倒了
Clay dropped them, too.

573
00:45:26,247 --> 00:45:29,371
当他转过来对付我们时 我们别无选择
When he turned on us,we had no choice.

574
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,061
我们把他杀了
We killed him.

575
00:45:31,505 --> 00:45:33,350
天杀的你们到底干了什么？
What the hell did you do?

576
00:45:33,427 --> 00:45:35,395
我们不得已而为之
We did what we had to.

577
00:45:35,481 --> 00:45:38,244
我们干掉了杀害你们的人的家伙
We killed the man that killed your men.

578
00:45:38,372 --> 00:45:40,920
这就是你要告诉爱尔兰之王们的故事
That's what you're gonna tell the Kings.

579
00:45:41,904 --> 00:45:43,237
人都是你杀的？
Did you murder them all?

580
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:45,053
你没有仔细听我的话
You're not listening to what I'm saying.

581
00:45:45,145 --> 00:45:48,197
我告诉你 你所需要的真实情况
I am giving you the truth you need.

582
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:50,268
只有这样的说法 才能保住你我的命
The only story that protects both of us.

583
00:45:50,344 --> 00:45:54,061
要是有其他的说法 都是说不过去的
Any other truth, you look like a failure.

584
00:45:55,241 --> 00:45:57,898
Clay原本可以保住我们的枪支生意
Clay was keeping our gun business alive.

585
00:45:58,259 --> 00:45:59,838
仍然会的
That still happens.

586
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:03,894
你告诉Roarke和其他的人 August Marks是他们
You tell Roarke and the others that August Marks is their

587
00:46:03,989 --> 00:46:06,333
在北加州市场唯一的选择
only option in Northern Cali.

588
00:46:06,432 --> 00:46:09,186
华人帮会将杀入这个市场 如果你们爱尔兰共和军
The Chinese are gonna jump on the
market if the IRA wait to

589
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,558
磨磨蹭蹭找其他的下家的话
find another distributor.

590
00:46:12,782 --> 00:46:16,105
要不你们和黑人帮合作 要不你们满盘皆输
It's work with black or lose it all.

591
00:46:17,787 --> 00:46:19,746
你在玩我 你这杂种 是不是？
You played me, you bastard, didn't you?

592
00:46:19,854 --> 00:46:25,110
就算我在玩你 我也要把你玩到头头的位置
If I did, I played you right into the number one slot.

593
00:46:25,611 --> 00:46:29,080
是去是留 全取决于你
It's up to you whether you want to stay there.

594
00:46:34,786 --> 00:46:37,589
你是一个聪明 正派的人 Connor
You're a smart,decent guy, Connor.

595
00:46:38,133 --> 00:46:40,730
我们都很清楚 这事必然会发生
We both know this had to happen.

596
00:46:40,836 --> 00:46:45,941
要是我们不这么做 躺在地上的将是你我
It was gonna be you and me lying on the floor if it didn't.

597
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,723
他们罪有应得
They earned that blood.

598
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:54,566
那么 就让我们翻过这一页
So let's move past it.

599
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:04,443
这样我们都能回家 回到家人身边
So we can both go home to our families.

600
00:47:14,073 --> 00:47:17,258
他们肯定还要听听你们的说法
The Kings will want to know your side of the story.

601
00:47:18,122 --> 00:47:19,835
不管怎样都行
Whatever you need.

602
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,922
要是他们不相信我们怎么办？
And what if they don't believe us then what?

603
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:29,338
那么我们以圣经的名义发誓
Then we swear on a stack of Catholic bibles.

604
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,983
明早我会给贝尔法斯特那边打电话
I'll call Belfast in the morning.

605
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,830
很好
Good.

606
00:48:03,517 --> 00:48:06,487
我们必须把KG-9与尸体留下
We're going to need to leave the KG-9's here with the bodies.

607
00:48:08,084 --> 00:48:09,277
其他的都带走
Take the rest of the guns.

608
00:48:09,378 --> 00:48:11,382
储存在饮料仓库
Store them in the beverage warehouse.

609
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,704
为什么？
Why?

610
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,610
我需要这些解决一些问题
I need to deal with a local problem.

611
00:48:16,116 --> 00:48:18,457
这些枪我会买单
I'll cover the cost of the guns.

612
00:48:51,466 --> 00:48:53,211
我会尽快回来
I'll be back as soon as I can.

613
00:49:01,222 --> 00:49:03,373
这确实一下难以接受 娃他妈 很遗憾
That was rough, mama. I'm sorry.

614
00:49:10,376 --> 00:49:13,377
我不知道为什么 我他妈的这么难过
I don't know why I'm so goddamn sad.

615
00:49:15,145 --> 00:49:19,585
嗨 不管好坏 Clay在你的生活中占了很大一块
Hey, good or bad, Clay was a huge piece of your life.

616
00:49:20,146 --> 00:49:21,458
你知道
You know?

617
00:49:22,513 --> 00:49:24,546
这会需要一段时间适应
It's going to take a minute.

618
00:49:27,314 --> 00:49:29,680
他可不值得我浪费时间
He's not worth a minute.

619
00:49:30,003 --> 00:49:31,115
好吧
Okay.

620
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:42,568
你要在俱乐部扮演什么角色呢？
Where are you at with the club?

621
00:49:44,659 --> 00:49:46,850
或者我不应该问？
Or shouldn't I be asking?

622
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:52,415
有一个教父悖论
Godfather paradox.

623
00:49:53,721 --> 00:49:59,102
越保持距离 就能越亲近
More distance I try to create, closer I get.

624
00:50:02,414 --> 00:50:04,641
Jax很喜欢你 Nero

他会听你的

627

是啊 嗯..
Yeah, well...

628
00:50:13,817 --> 00:50:16,274
可惜太大了 我不能收养
little too old to adopt.

629
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,727
你可以娶我啊
You can always marry me.

630
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,632
没有冒犯的意思 娃他妈

我知道你老公发生的事情

00:50:43,635 --> 00:50:45,422
不太好
It's not.

635
00:50:58,078 --> 00:51:00,539
有你走进我的生活 我太幸福了

641
00:51:22,384 --> 00:51:23,580
为什么/

Clay Morrow 没有被送到郡法院

押运他的车中了埋伏

有8到9个不明身份的袭击者

Those other complications I had pending are now off the table,

648
00:51:40,733 --> 00:51:44,312

which means I've decided to take you up on your offer.

649
00:51:44,414 --> 00:51:47,424
换取你的合作 来对付帮会
In exchange for your cooperation against the MC,

我的孩子怎么说？还有保护措施
What about my boys? And protection.

652
00:52:03,296 --> 00:52:06,383
如果你想获得证人保护计划 那就意味着要引用反黑法案了
If you want Witness Protection, it'll mean using RICO.

653
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:08,998
你要提供给我们的是重大犯罪事实
You'll have to provide us with a federal crime.

661
00:52:41,031 --> 00:52:43,492
上面会携带有DNA

662
00:52:43,579 --> 00:52:45,592
那算是证据吗？
Would that be proof?

663
00:52:46,428 --> 00:52:48,051
加上你的证词 那就是
With your testimony, yes,

664
00:52:48,147 --> 00:52:50,448
那将证明 有一个帮会成员在犯罪现场

665
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:53,842
从而证实混乱之子要为此事负责

我认为她将忙碌一整夜

你要我们跟踪她吗？

673
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,019
不 我们不能把她置于险地
No. We don't want to put her at risk.

干得漂亮 医生

再取出一小块，他就脱离险境了
Just one more little piece, and he should be out of the woods.

683
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,233
她的白色折边帽哪去了？

还有她的礼服和裙子

685

她长得真是又小又黑

浑身长满了刺刺
