有什么能帮助您的吗
Can I help you?

你还记得我吗
Do you remember me?

4
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:17,727
抱歉 我认识你吗
I'm sorry, do I know you?

5
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:20,496
你认识我吗
Do you know me?

6
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:21,997
我认识你
I know you.

7
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:27,436
我认识你 我认识你
know you! I know you!

00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,938
# 我今早起床 #
I got out of bed today

9
00:01:29,972 --> 00:01:33,141
# 对上帝发誓我看不见我的脸 #
Swear to God I couldn't see my face

10
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:38,147
# 我今早起床注视着一缕灵魂 #
I got out of bed today staring at a ghost

11
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:41,682
# 你看到我的灵魂了么 #
Oh have you seen my ghost

12
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:44,585
# 感觉到它了么 看到它了么 #
Seen my ghost, seen my ghost?

13
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:49,590
# 你看到我的灵魂了么 它凝视着地面 #
Oh have you seen my ghost staring at the ground?

心灵缉凶 第二季第4集


15
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:01,924
咱们去吃午餐吧 我请客 
Let's go for lunch. On me. 

16
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:02,969
你怎么了
What's with you?

17
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:04,540
怎么 我不能请队员们吃午餐吗 
What I can't buy the team lunch? 

18
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,638
不是 只是...
No, it's just...

19
00:02:05,673 --> 00:02:07,974
你在示好 拉倒吧你
you're trying to be nice. Stop it.

20
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,095
不不 别拉倒啊 
No, no, don't stop it. 

21
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,543
我喜欢友善的艾登 还有免费午餐
I like the nice Aidan. And free lunch?

22
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:14,379
- 那么我们去哪里呢 - 肯森顿市场
- So, where are we going? - Kensington Market.

23
00:02:14,413 --> 00:02:15,948
- 炸玉米饼吗 - 鸡肉馅饼
- Tacos? - Empanadas.

24
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:17,221
- 蓄意谋杀 - 是的
- Attempt Murder. - That's right. 

25
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:20,402
今早在肯森顿市场发生一起持刀行凶案件
There was a knife attack in Kensington Market this morning. 

26
00:02:20,403 --> 00:02:21,576
受害人被砍了五刀
Victim was slashed 5 times. 

27
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:22,888
缝了一百多针 但没有生命危险
Over 100 stitches, but he'll live.

28
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:24,690
凭什么分给我们呢 嫌疑人还是受害人
What makes it ours? Suspect, or victim?

29
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:26,692
对嫌疑人还一无所知 他现在不知所踪
Nothing on the suspect. He's in the wind.

30
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:29,894
是因为受害人 艾德瑞斯约翰 四十岁 
You're on it for the victim - Idaris John, 40.

31
00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:32,396
医疗记录显示他被诊断为患有
Medical records show he's been diagnosed with p...

32
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,032
人 面 失 认...
pro-so-pag-noss...

33
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:36,968
人面失认症 真的吗
Prosopagnosia. For real?

34
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:39,670
超罕见的 真有点意思
Huh. It's super rare, really interesting.

35
00:02:39,705 --> 00:02:42,039
对 通俗的说法是" 脸盲 "
Yeah, layman's term is "Face Blindness".

36
00:02:42,073 --> 00:02:43,807
- 比如 - 意思是说 如果你得上了
- As in...? - As in, if you have it,

37
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:45,629
你就不能辨别任何面部特征
you can't make sense of any facial features. 

38
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,743
你分不出谁是谁
You can't tell one person from the other, 

39
00:02:47,744 --> 00:02:48,745
除非通过声音
unless you heard their voice

40
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:50,747
或他们的其他特征来辨认
or recognized some other part of them.

41
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:52,300
大脑不像本应该的那样
The brain just doesn't process 

42
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:55,126
处理面部特征的视觉信息
the visual information of a face the way it's supposed to. 

43
00:02:55,127 --> 00:02:57,135
这通常是神经损伤的征兆
It's often a sign of neurological damage, 

44
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:58,755
例如脑损伤或中风
like a brain injury or a stroke.

45
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:00,189
好了 你们去市场
OK, you guys get to the Market, 

46
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,560
你们俩去医院
you two get down to the hospital, 

47
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:03,358
看能否诱导艾德瑞斯约翰说出些什么
see if you can coax anything out of Idaris John.

48
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:05,003
我们需要关于攻击者的描述
We need a description of the assailant. 

49
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:05,930
好把他拘捕归案
Let's get this guy off the street.

50
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:13,602
约翰先生吗
Mr. John?

51
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:15,370
我认识你吗
Do I know you?

52
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:18,006
我是马龙医生 替警方工作
I'm Doctor Malone. I work with the police.

53
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,874
这位是韦涅夫斯基警探
This is Detective Wisnefski.

54
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:23,042
我已经跟一位警官说过了
I already spoke to an officer. 

55
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:25,079
我辩认不出他是谁
I cannot identify this man.

56
00:03:25,113 --> 00:03:26,581
我明白
I understand that.

57
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:28,616
我看过你的档案摘要
I've read a summary of your file.

58
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:31,853
你过去四年左右都是这个状态吗
You've had your condition for the last 4 years or so?

59
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:34,321
我记不清有多久了
I cannot remember how long.

60
00:03:34,356 --> 00:03:36,623
你得去问我的医生
You'll have to ask my doctor.

61
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:40,894
你能告诉我你望着我的时候看到的是什么吗
Can you tell me what you see when you look at me?

62
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:49,069
我能看到你完整的面部
You have all the pieces of a face...

63
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,571
鼻子
a nose,

64
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:54,207
嘴巴
mouth...

65
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:56,209
以及你的眼睛
and your eyes.

66
00:03:56,243 --> 00:03:59,546
你的眼睛非常特别
You have very unique eyes.

67
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,715
我或许认识你
I might recognize you.

68
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:05,117
你是怎么处理这些信息的
How do you cope?

69
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:06,685
我有医生
I have a doctor.

70
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,789
他教我一些技巧 方法
He teaches me tricks, techniques.

71
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:13,292
辅以声音 首饰
Voices help, jewellery,

72
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:15,727
纹身
tattoos.

73
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:19,364
我看你主要是看你的枪
I look at you and mainly I see your gun.

74
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,165
这也是我
It's how I would be

75
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,001
如果再次见到你最有可能认出你的方式
most likely to know you if I see you again.

76
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:27,538
那个袭击了你的人 你注意到了他的什么
The man who attacked you, what did you notice about him?

77
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:32,143
他的刀
His knife.

78
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,582
"我认识你" 或者 "你认识我"
"I know you" or "You know me".

79
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:40,584
这就是目击者们声称他们听到的
That's what the witnesses said that they heard.

80
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:42,586
有关于疑犯的描述吗
Any description of the suspect?

81
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,788
黑人男子 年龄在十八到四十五之间
Black male. I'm getting ages from 18 to 45,

82
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:47,193
身高五尺八到六尺二之间 
height from 5'8 " to 6'2". 

83
00:04:47,194 --> 00:04:48,858
这么说 他们注意到了他是个黑人
So, they noticed he was black.

84
00:04:48,892 --> 00:04:50,994
正如所料 仅此而已
Figures. That's about all.

85
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:54,062
跑这么老远 砍了艾德瑞斯约翰五刀
You go this far, you slash Idaris John 5 times.

86
00:04:54,097 --> 00:04:56,765
但却不足以杀死他 那么为何住手呢
Not much more to kill him. So, why stop?

87
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:58,767
刺杀才致命
Stab wounds kill.

88
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:00,469
他只是砍
He only slashed.

89
00:05:00,504 --> 00:05:03,205
你是什么 嗜血法医吗 你在看鲜血飞溅吗
What are you, Dexter? You're reading blood spatter?

90
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,075
我看医学报告 你医过多少刺伤
I read the medical reports. How many stab wounds have you treated?

91
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,044
如此说来 要么他不知道自己在干啥
So, either he didn't know what he was doing 

92
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:10,011
要么就是不想杀他
or he didn't want to kill him.

93
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:12,514
或许是想借此传个口信
Maybe he was trying to send a message.

94
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:15,617
弃妇的汉子 或许艾德瑞斯没出保护费
Jilted husband. Maybe Idaris didn't pay protection.

95
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:17,619
或许他赌博呢
Maybe he gambles.

96
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:19,854
也没准艾德瑞斯只是随机被选中的受害人
Or, maybe Idaris was just a random victim.

97
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:21,269
目击者听到了" 我认识你 " 
Witnesses heard "I know you" 

98
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,190
和 " 你认识我 "
or "you know me"?

99
00:05:22,224 --> 00:05:23,824
这么说 你觉得是私人恩怨了
So, you think it's personal.

100
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:26,693
我希望是 可不想是随机挑选的
I hope it's personal. We don't want random.

101
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:29,163
你们在干什么 艾德瑞斯呢 他没事吧
What are you doing? Where's Idaris? Is he gonna be OK?

102
00:05:29,197 --> 00:05:32,204
没事 我们的人在医院陪着他
OK, our people are with him over at the hospital. 

103
00:05:32,205 --> 00:05:33,333
他不会有事的
He's gonna be fine.

104
00:05:33,368 --> 00:05:36,336
你们如何处置他的物品 他什么也没干
What were you doing with his stuff? He didn't do anything.

105
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:38,338
有人袭击了他 我们只是试图找出原因
Someone attacked him. We're just trying to figure out why.

106
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:40,673
听着 我们不想给约翰先生制造任何麻烦
Look, we're not trying to cause any trouble for Mr. John.

107
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:41,572
你在这里工作吗
Do you work here? 

108
00:05:41,573 --> 00:05:43,543
对 现在该我值班了
Yeah, my shift was supposed to start now.

109
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,179
- 你叫什么名字 - 茱莉娅
- What's your name? - Julia.

110
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,481
茱莉娅 你知道有谁想伤害你老板吗
Julia, do you know anyone who'd want to hurt your boss?

111
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,651
不知道 人人都爱艾德瑞斯
No. Everybody loves Idaris.

112
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,853
调查警司 我找到些东西
Detective Sergeant? I found something.

113
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:59,691
- 我觉得是刀头 - 我想我拿到了
- I think the blade's up. - I think I got it.

114
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:09,668
滚开 会把你们手指打掉的
Get the hell out of here! You'll blow your fingers off!

115
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,536
嘿 艾登 你还好吧
Yo, Aidan. You cool?

116
00:06:13,871 --> 00:06:15,339
没事 伙计
Yeah, man.

117
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:17,874
只是有点神经质 仅此而已
Just a little jumpy, that's all.

118
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:22,079
还在做团体倾诉治疗吗
Still doing that group thing?

119
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:24,748
去得不够
Not enough.

120
00:06:27,652 --> 00:06:29,552
- 你能负责取出来吗 - 可以
- You want to take care of that? - Yeah.

121
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:51,440
貌似他不止记不住面孔
Seems like it's not just faces he can't remember.

122
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:53,842
他有短期记忆问题
He has short-term memory problems.

123
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:55,844
人面失认症可能更大部分是
The prosopagnosia could be part of larger

124
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:57,128
神经退行性问题 
neurodegenerative issues. 

125
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:58,880
打扰一下 我们能帮上忙吗
Excuse me. Can we help you?

126
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:01,415
我看着像需要帮忙吗
Uh, oh, do I look like I need help?

127
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,118
我们正处于评估的中间环节 如果您能
We're just in the middle of an assessment. If you could

128
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:07,755
给我们点时间 布鲁克曼医生
just give us a moment, Dr... Bruckmann. Oh,

129
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:09,957
您专门从事老年病学 对吗
you specialize in geriatrics, right?

130
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:12,159
对 是的 你们在评估我的患者吗
Yes, I do. You're assessing my patient?

131
00:07:12,193 --> 00:07:15,630
他是一桩犯罪的受害者 我是克拉拉马龙医生
He was a victim in a crime. I'm Dr. Clara Malone.

132
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:18,431
这位是心理犯案组的韦涅夫斯基警探
This is Detective Wisnefski with Psych Crimes Unit.

133
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:20,667
那么 您是他的精神科医生对吗
So, you're his psychiatrist?

134
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:23,570
- 但是他 - 很年轻 对 是的
- But he's... - Young. Yes, he is.

135
00:07:23,604 --> 00:07:25,572
我们来这里是因为脸盲
We're here because of the face blindness.

136
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:28,007
我们希望他能给出些描述
We'd hoped for some kind of a description out of him.

137
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,310
- 对他而言是不可能的 - 我意识到了
- That's not possible for him. - I realize that,

138
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:32,878
但是他的记忆有些问题
but he has some memory problems.

139
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:40,319
脸盲是他初期症状的一种
The prosopagnosia was one of his first symptoms.

140
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:43,322
接着是记忆丧失 定向障碍
Then memory loss, some disorientation.

141
00:07:43,356 --> 00:07:45,691
- 早发性老年痴呆症吗 - 恐怕是的
- Early-onset Alzheimer's? - I'm afraid so.

142
00:07:45,725 --> 00:07:48,126
- 他怎么会 四十出头吗 - 确实不常见
- He's what, early 40s? - It's not common.

143
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:50,861
- 但可能致命 - 他患病多久了
- But likely fatal. - How long has he got?

144
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:52,142
五六年了
Five or six years. 

145
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:54,164
他正进入中期
He's heading into the middle stages. 

146
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:55,466
他的记忆浮现又消失
His memory comes and goes.

147
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:57,968
这么说 他明天或许会记得更多喽
So, he might remember more tomorrow?

148
00:07:58,003 --> 00:07:59,970
有可能
He might.

149
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:02,473
但如果你想让他描述的话
But if you're hoping to get a description out of him...

150
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:04,208
没可能的
that's never gonna happen.

151
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:10,380
一个符合我们模糊描述的人
A guy matching our vague description, he applied

152
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:12,749
申请了一份在拐角理发店的清扫工作
for a job sweeping up at a barbershop around the corner.

153
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,018
好啊 我们去找他谈谈
All right, let's go talk to him.

154
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:16,953
没那么简单 他只留了个电子邮箱
It's not that easy. He only left an email contact.

155
00:08:16,987 --> 00:08:18,455
没有电话号码 没有地址
No phone number, no address.

156
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:20,589
- 有没有名字呢 - 本
- What about a name? - Ben.

157
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:22,399
好吧 让波比以理发店老板的身份
All right, I'll have Poppy email him 

158
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:22,991
给他发邮件
as a barbershop owner,

159
00:08:23,026 --> 00:08:24,993
设计一个假面试 引诱他过来
set up a fake interview, lure him in.

160
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:26,995
等一下 所以你是那么容易就允许撒谎了吗
Wait, so, you're allowed to lie to people that easy?

161
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,997
- 是啊 - 而这不是个圈套吗
- Yeah. - And it's not entrapment?

162
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:31,266
不 请他来买一斤可卡因才是圈套
No, it's entrapment to invite a guy to buy a key of coke,

163
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:33,554
但邀请他来工作面试 告诉他他赢了彩票 
but invite him to a job interview, tell him he won the lottery, 

164
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,503
这都是公平的游戏
that's all fair game.

165
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:37,004
该死 我该开始好好练练我的说谎技巧了
Damn. I gotta start working on my lying skills.

166
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,006
留给专业人员吧
Leave it to the professionals.

167
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,676
哦 等一下 马上
Oh, hold on, one second.

168
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:43,411
你承诺过的
You promised.

169
00:08:43,446 --> 00:08:47,014
- 来吧 兄弟 - 好吧
- Come on, man. - All right.

170
00:08:49,518 --> 00:08:52,753
把刀藏起来可不叫做随机犯罪
Hiding the knife doesn't say random.

171
00:08:52,787 --> 00:08:55,756
好吧 这是个理性选择 至少对一个
Well, it's a rational choice. At least, rational for somebody

172
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,758
四处流窜 用刀伤人的人来说是合理的
who goes around attacking people with a knife.

173
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,554
然后就有了那句'我认识你' 
Then there's the "I know you". 

174
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:01,428
而艾德瑞斯并不认为这是真的
Which Idaris doesn't think is true.

175
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:03,529
但是艾德瑞斯是不可信证人
But Idaris is an unreliable witness.

176
00:09:03,564 --> 00:09:05,966
好的 找到与刀上指纹匹配的人了 
OK, the prints off the knife got a match. 

177
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:06,867
本杰明奥马里
Benjamin Omari.

178
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:09,372
一个刚果民主共和国的难民 
A refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo. 

179
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:10,703
他到这六个月了
He's been in the country 6 months.

180
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:12,772
本 是本
Ben. Ben!

181
00:09:12,806 --> 00:09:14,607
波比 你收到邮件回复了吗
Poppy, did you get a reply to that email?

182
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:17,643
没有 这孩子还在外面某处 有前科吗
Crickets. The kid's still out there somewhere. Priors?

183
00:09:17,678 --> 00:09:20,645
- 没有 - 那我们怎么得到指纹匹配的
- None. - Then how'd we get a print match?

184
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,648
新的难民法 所有申请人都要取指纹
This new refugee law. Everyone applying for status gets fingerprinted.

185
00:09:23,683 --> 00:09:25,367
而我们可以用那个数据库 
And we can access that database? 

186
00:09:25,368 --> 00:09:27,052
这是什么 一个极权国家吗
What is this, a police state?

187
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:29,388
我们匹配上了嫌疑人 我只关心这个
We got a match to our suspect. That's all I care about.

188
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:31,390
本杰明奥马里有住址吗
Does Benjamin Omari have an address?

189
00:09:31,424 --> 00:09:33,825
所知的最后一处是难民庇护所
Last known was a refugee shelter.

190
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,827
几个月前他被赶了出来 此后就没人见过他
He got kicked out a couple months ago. No one's seen him since.

191
00:09:36,862 --> 00:09:37,917
他是被资助的
He was sponsored coming over; 

192
00:09:37,918 --> 00:09:40,946
是一个叫国际司法监控的人权组织
human rights organization called Justice Monitor International.

193
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:45,770
一个叫索兰格奥乌苏的人帮他签发的
A Solange Owusu signed off on him.

194
00:09:45,804 --> 00:09:48,072
你知道这儿有什么人和他在一块吗
Do you know if there's anyone else here with him?

195
00:09:48,107 --> 00:09:50,107
- 朋友 家人 - 我去拿他的档案
- Friends, family? - I'll get his file.

196
00:09:57,748 --> 00:09:59,449
没人
No one.

197
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:03,586
他独自一人在这
He's alone here.

198
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:05,755
能让我看下这个吗
Can I just see that?

199
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:10,626
哦 上帝 这看起来好像他
Oh, my god. It looks just like him.

200
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,728
是的 那是本 十二岁时
Yes, that's Ben, age 12.

201
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:14,931
不 不是本 那是谁
No, not Ben. Who's that?

202
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:17,266
穆萨布图罗
Musa Buturo.

203
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:19,535
刚果的通缉犯
Wanted for crimes in the Congo.

204
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:22,503
他被称作梅鲁戈 巫师
He went by the name Melugo. The Wizard.

205
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,439
他是本的指挥官之一 怎么了
He's one of Ben's commanders. Why?

206
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:26,874
他看起来就像本袭击的那个人
He looks just like the man Ben attacked.

207
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:28,776
这是艾德瑞斯约翰
That's Idaris John.

208
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,281
你对刚果民主共和国的战役
What do you know about the war in The Democratic

209
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:34,790
知道些什么 
Republic of Congo? 

210
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,603
是自二战后伤亡最多的斗争 
Most casualties in a conflict since World War II, 

211
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:38,919
而且看不见尽头
and no end in sight.

212
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:40,238
这人扮演什么角色 
What was this man's role? 

213
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,456
梅鲁戈是一个反叛民兵的指挥官
Melugo was a commander in the rebel militia

214
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,925
他们杀了几百 更可能是几千人
that has killed hundreds, more likely thousands.

215
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,294
他已经躲藏了好多年了
He's been in hiding for years.

216
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:53,167
这是唯一已知的他的视频
This is the only known video of him.

217
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:56,092
这被称为非洲的内战 
This has been called Africa's civil war. 

218
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:57,470
数以百万人死去
Millions are dead.

219
00:10:57,504 --> 00:11:00,506
你自己为了你的人民的自由而流血
You yourself have shed blood for the freedom of your people.

220
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,308
你说这是上帝的旨意
You've said it was God's will.

221
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:05,845
我只说过让我的人民自由是上帝的旨意
I've only said it is God's will for my people to be free.

222
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:09,548
让他所有的孩子自由正是他的旨意
It is His will for all His children to be free.

223
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,783
你说到孩子们的自由
You talk of freedom for children,

224
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:14,686
而你却仍在绑架 灌输
and yet you abducted and indoctrinated

225
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,689
数百孩子为你而战 难道不是吗
hundreds of children to fight for your cause. Is that not true?

226
00:11:17,723 --> 00:11:21,426
我没绑架任何人 强迫任何人
I abduct no one. Force no one.

227
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:22,433
你在这看到孩子
You see children here 

228
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:24,796
是因为我给他们提供了一个安全的处所
because I give them a safe place.

229
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,420
是什么告诉你 
What does it tell you 

230
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:28,466
他们寻求武装保护了
that they ask for arms to protect themselves?

231
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,969
在这我们每天都要为生活而战
We fight for our lives here every day.

232
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:33,971
那你呢
What about you?

233
00:11:34,006 --> 00:11:35,772
你为什么而战
What do you fight for?

234
00:11:37,775 --> 00:11:42,212
你说他在这吗 本袭击的人就是他
And you say he's here? This is the man Ben attacked?

235
00:11:42,246 --> 00:11:44,714
他们非常的相像
The resemblance is very strong.

236
00:11:44,748 --> 00:11:47,139
但是我在现场看过艾德瑞斯的个人档案 
But I saw Idaris' personal documents at the scene. 

237
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,518
一切看起来都是合法的
Everything looked legit.

238
00:11:48,552 --> 00:11:50,920
这些人不但是盗贼还是杀手
These men are thieves as well as killers.

239
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:53,890
用他们偷走的东西 他们能买一个新的身份
With what they steal, they can buy a new identity.

240
00:11:53,924 --> 00:11:55,892
所以 梅鲁戈是本的指挥官 然后
So, Melugo was Ben's commander, and then

241
00:11:55,926 --> 00:11:58,560
他彻底改变自己成为艾德瑞斯约翰
he reinvented himself as Idaris John.

242
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:00,496
这给了我们袭击的动机
Gives us a motive for the attack.

243
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,065
也带来了另一个问题
And it brings up another question:

244
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:05,100
谁才是这真正的受害者
who's the real victim here?

245
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:12,902
看起来确实像是同一个人
Well it sure looks like the same guy.

246
00:12:13,022 --> 00:12:14,337
所以 我们对艾德瑞斯约翰了解些什么
So, what do we know about Idaris John?

247
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:16,991
他在这四年了 水果超市开了三年
He's been here 4 years, he's had the fruit market for 3.

248
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:19,727
没有犯罪记录 没有移民局标记
There's no record, no flags from Immigration.

249
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:22,417
这家伙为自己制造了一个可靠的新身份 
This guy's created a solid new identity for himself. 

250
00:12:22,418 --> 00:12:23,969
好吧 如果是假的 就不可靠
Well, if it's false, it's not solid.

251
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:25,900
他从哪儿弄来的钱开水果超市呢
Where'd he get the money for the fruit market?

252
00:12:25,934 --> 00:12:28,769
他通过一家信用合作社理财
He runs his finances through a local credit union...

253
00:12:28,804 --> 00:12:30,137
一家分公司 很低调 
one branch, low profile. 

254
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:31,605
看起来他把钱藏在海外了
Looks like he's got money stashed offshore,

255
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:34,273
- 但我看不到细节 - 第一个问题是
- but I can't get the details. - First question is:

256
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:36,910
我们怎么确认艾德瑞斯约翰就是梅鲁戈
How do we confirm that Idaris John is Melugo?

257
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:37,794
我们有视频 
We have the video. 

258
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:39,813
是 但里面没说他的名字 而且也没有
Yeah, but he's not mentioned by name, and it's no proof

259
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:41,815
他被指控所犯罪行的证据 所以我恐怕
of the crimes he's accused of committing, so we're not

260
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:43,583
我们无法从里面得到真凭实据
going to get much hard evidence from there, I'm afraid.

261
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:45,584
那我们得找到本奥马里 他能确认
Then we need to find Ben Omari. He can confirm that

262
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:48,153
艾德瑞斯是他的前指挥官并使这个视频合法化
Idaris is his former commander and legitimize this video.

263
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:50,249
所以 唯一能让这视频与艾德瑞斯联系上的
So, the only guy who can pin this on Idaris 

264
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,527
就是那个袭击了他被通缉的人
is the one wanted for attacking him.

265
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:52,503
你有他的消息吗
Have you heard from him?

266
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:55,327
还没回复面试 我一点儿也不惊讶
Still no reply to the job interview. I'm not surprised.

267
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:58,330
- 我可以试试告诉他被聘用了 - 好吧
- I could try telling him he's hired? - All right,

268
00:12:58,364 --> 00:12:59,965
那么等确认了艾德瑞斯的身份 然后呢 
so when we do ID Idaris, then what? 

269
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:00,766
我们能把他驱逐出境吗
Can we deport him?

270
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,946
如果我们能证明他是战犯
If we can prove he's a war criminal 

271
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:04,702
而且他没有接受处决
and he's not facing execution for his crimes.

272
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:07,038
没有那么快 由鉴于他的精神状况
Not so fast. With his mental condition,

273
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:09,106
他可以以就医为由反对驱逐出境
he can fight deportation on medical grounds.

274
00:13:09,141 --> 00:13:11,275
- 你开玩笑呢吧 - 这是法律
- You gotta be kidding me. - It's the law.

275
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:13,745
这多方便啊
How convenient is that?

276
00:13:15,748 --> 00:13:17,281
如果他是装的呢
What if he's faking?

277
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:20,350
艾德瑞斯在他到这后不久
Idaris started seeing Dr. Bruckmann

278
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:23,253
就开始在布鲁克曼医生看病 那就是四年来
not long after he arrived. That's 4 years

279
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:26,690
愚弄一个在该领域相当著名的专家 不太可能
of fooling a fairly well-known expert in the field. Not likely.

280
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:28,692
好吧 可这些都是不可能的啊 我们的受害者
OK, but none of this is likely. Our victim is

281
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:31,728
是一个战犯 而攻击者是他的前童子军
a war criminal, our assailant is his former child soldier.

282
00:13:31,763 --> 00:13:34,064
正如索兰格所说 这家伙是个老练的骗子
And like Solange said, this guy's a practiced liar.

283
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:36,399
好吧 如果他是装的 我们就得证明
OK, if he's faking, then we've got to prove it.

284
00:13:36,434 --> 00:13:38,734
我可以评估他
I can assess him.

285
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:49,079
艾德瑞斯
Idaris.

286
00:13:49,113 --> 00:13:50,579
我认识你吗
Do I know you?

287
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:52,114
不认识吗
Don't you?

288
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:56,985
马龙医生
Dr. Malone.

289
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:59,521
你的眼睛 我告诉过你的
Your eyes. I told you.

290
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:01,190
我为什么在这
Why am I here?

291
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:03,225
我能给你看几幅图吗
Can I show you some pictures?

292
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:17,037
你认识这些人吗
Do you recognize anyone here?

293
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:22,209
我认识其中的哪一个吗
Do I know one of them?

294
00:14:22,243 --> 00:14:24,978
我相信你全认识
I believe you know all of them.

295
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:29,782
我不认识
I do not know.

296
00:14:29,817 --> 00:14:32,552
你认得出他吗
Do you recognize this one?

297
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,424
他怎么了
How about him?

298
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,230
- 是袭击我的那个人吗 - 不 这是你
- Is that the man who attacked me? - No. This one is you.

299
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,900
好的 不再有人脸了
OK, no more faces.

300
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:52,304
- 谢谢 结束了吗 - 还没有
- Thank you. Are we done? - Not quite.

301
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:54,439
我想让你画个钟给我
I'd like you to draw a clock for me.

302
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:56,407
画个简单的就行
Just a simple one.

303
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:21,830
没我的医生说的那么糟 对吗
Not so bad as my doctor says, am I?

304
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:23,866
你做得很好
You're doing fine.

305
00:15:26,136 --> 00:15:28,107
那么 我刚刚看到什么了 
So, what did I just see? 

306
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:29,938
他的症状就是教科书上的
His symptoms are textbook.

307
00:15:29,973 --> 00:15:32,940
- 每个细节都很符合 - 这正常吗
- Every detail was exactly right. - Is that normal?

308
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,942
人脑唯一不变的特质
Well, the only thing consistent with the human brain

309
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:38,146
就是其不一致性 所以不 不正常
is its inconsistency, so no, it's not.

310
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:40,382
- 所以他在说谎 - 不是我能证明的
- So, he's lying. - Not so I can prove it.

311
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,417
检查结果与他之前的诊断一致
The test confirmed his diagnosis.

312
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:45,153
别管检查 你的直觉是什么
Screw the test. What's your gut tell you?

313
00:15:45,188 --> 00:15:47,055
直觉不准确
It doesn't work that way.

314
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:49,056
克拉拉 我是说你望着这个人时看到了什么
Clara, I mean, you look at this guy, what do you see?

315
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,958
- 他到底病了没有 - 我不知道 艾登
- Is he sick, or not? - I don't know, Aidan.

316
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,361
我好像是在透过面具看人
It's like I'm looking at a mask.

317
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:56,977
那我们怎么把面具拿掉 
So, how do we take it off? 

318
00:15:56,978 --> 00:15:58,765
我跟律师聊过了
I spoke with Legal.

319
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,561
克拉拉是对的 
Clara is right. 

320
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:01,168
我们不能单单依据一个诊断就把人驱逐出境
We can't deport someone with his diagnosis.

321
00:16:01,203 --> 00:16:02,942
那我们就要将他就地送审 
Then we need to put him on trial right here. 

322
00:16:02,943 --> 00:16:04,971
这个人是战犯啊 戴安娜
This guy's a war criminal, Dianne.

323
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,941
战争法到目前为止只定罪过一次
The War Crimes Act has resulted in one conviction ever,

324
00:16:07,975 --> 00:16:09,943
那次还有多个目击证人指证 
and that was a case with multiple witnesses.

325
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:12,294
由于艾德瑞斯有神经障碍 
With Idaris' neurological disorder, 

326
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:14,280
他可能从未上庭受审过
he may never even see the inside of a courtroom.

327
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:15,849
或者这次就逃不过了
Or maybe he will.

328
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:18,685
你还记得我说过艾德瑞斯的症状很典型吗
You remember I said Idaris' symptoms were textbook?

329
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
- 记得 - 这里一个病人的描述
- Yeah. - A patient in here describes

330
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:24,023
与艾德瑞斯的病情描述完全一致
her condition with the exact same words Idaris used with me.

331
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:26,525
你是说他可能从书上读来的症状
So, you're saying he read the book?

332
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,194
有这个可能
Maybe, yes.

333
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:32,798
他给我画了这个 你们看
He drew this for me. Look.

334
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,800
别告诉我这是巧合
OK, don't try and tell me that's a coincidence.

335
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:38,169
连细节都一样 不太可能是巧合
To this level of detail? Can't be.

336
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:39,474
也就是说他在装 
So, he's faking. 

337
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:40,872
这可行么 装了四年
Is that plausible? Four years?

338
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:42,874
这个人知道他在做什么
Look, this guy knows what he's done. He knew

339
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:44,221
他知道有一天可能会被抓到
the odds were he'd be found out someday, 

340
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:46,614
所以他提前编好了说辞
so he set himself up in advance. 

341
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:47,645
他生病了 不能被遣送
He's a sick man, can't be deported,

342
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,647
甚至都不能受审
maybe not even fit to stand trial here.

343
00:16:49,681 --> 00:16:51,649
那个多年逍遥法外的暴徒
Who was that mobster that walked around for years

344
00:16:51,683 --> 00:16:53,308
穿着浴袍自言自语的 
in his bathrobe talking to himself, 

345
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:55,585
还是组织首领的那个人是谁来着
running his organization the whole time?

346
00:16:55,705 --> 00:16:56,768
文尼希甘特 他的伎俩就成功了
Vinny Gigante, and it worked.

347
00:16:56,888 --> 00:17:00,090
即使艾德瑞斯想这样 那没人帮忙他也做不到
Even if he wanted to, Idaris couldn't do this without help.

348
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,159
- 你在说什么 - 这本书的作者之一
- What are you saying? - One of the contributors

349
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:05,729
是他的医生的保罗布鲁克曼
to the book is his doctor, Paul Bruckmann.

350
00:17:05,764 --> 00:17:07,864
你认为他受布鲁克曼指使 
You think Bruckmann coached him? 

351
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:09,365
我觉得有必要一问
I think we have to ask.

352
00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:15,872
达拉奇斯夫人 我们下周见
So, we'll see you next week, Mrs. Dalakis.

353
00:17:15,906 --> 00:17:18,641
好的 再见
OK, bye-bye.

354
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:21,778
你好 马龙医生你好 这位是...
Oh, hello, Dr. Malone. And...?

355
00:17:21,812 --> 00:17:23,279
布莱克警官
Detective Black.

356
00:17:23,313 --> 00:17:25,847
- 能聊聊吗 - 嗯 下一个病人来之前
- Can we have a word? - Well, I've got

357
00:17:25,882 --> 00:17:28,850
- 我有十分钟间歇 - 太好了
- 10 minutes between patients. - Perfect.

358
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:34,689
哇 看
Oh, wow, look at those.

359
00:17:34,723 --> 00:17:36,691
太棒了 是老年精神病学联盟奖么
Amazing. Is that an AGPA?

360
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:38,693
2009年 是的
Two thousand and nine, yes.

361
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:42,362
老年精神病学联盟奖 真了不起
Affiliation of Geriatric Psychiatry Award. Very big deal.

362
00:17:42,397 --> 00:17:44,598
非常厉害
Impressive.

363
00:17:44,632 --> 00:17:48,302
是这样的 我们跟艾德瑞斯沟通很难
So, we're having a hard time getting through to Idaris,

364
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:49,110
我在想 
and I'm wondering if, 

365
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:52,206
除去老年痴呆症造成的记忆丧失之外
in addition to memory lapses associated with Alzheimer's,

366
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,541
可能还存在一些文化差异的问题
there may be some transcultural issues.

367
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,976
你知道他在非洲的生活么
Do you know anything about his life in Africa?

368
00:17:57,011 --> 00:18:01,047
有什么事情可能会影响他对这次袭击的反应么
Anything that might be affecting the way he's processing the attack?

369
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,049
我知道他来自于一个动荡的地方
I know he comes from an unstable area,

370
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,484
他以难民的身份逃到这里
that he fled under refugee status.

371
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,621
我只能推测他有很坎坷的经历
I'd assumed his story was not a pleasant one.

372
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,029
也就是说治疗期间
But you didn't specifically deal with 

373
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,091
你没有具体问到他的过去了
any of that during the course of treatment?

374
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:14,426
我主要关注他的精神损伤
My focus has been on his mental deterioration...

375
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,429
他的应对机制 以及他的人脸识别障碍
coping mechanisms for it, and his prosopagnosia.

376
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,431
实际的治疗策略 当然 
Practical therapeutic strategies, sure.

377
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,801
但是说实在的 他从没提过他的过去
But really, his past never came up?

378
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:25,637
没有具体说过
Not specifically, no.

379
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,772
也就是说你并不知道艾德瑞斯约翰是
So you're not aware that Idaris John is

380
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,974
被通缉的战犯咯
a wanted war criminal?

381
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,843
什么
What?

382
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,544
你就没想过
Has it occurred to you

383
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:38,449
艾德瑞斯可能只是想逃过惩罚
that Idaris could be malingering to escape prosecution?

384
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:41,085
我怎么会想到呢
How could that occur to me?

385
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,519
太荒谬了
That's ridiculous. 

386
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,488
艾德瑞斯给我画了这幅画
Idaris did this drawing for me.

387
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:51,629
你出版的一本书里
You published a very similar image 

388
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,529
有一副相似的画 还有印象吧
in one of your books, didn't you?

389
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:55,832
其实 应该不只是相似吧
Fact is, it's more than similar, isn't it?

390
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,667
我们知道他在装病
We know he's faking,

391
00:18:57,701 --> 00:19:00,036
布鲁克曼医生 你为何不告诉我们真相
Dr. Bruckmann, so why don't you just tell us the truth?

392
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:03,038
- 你在暗示我说谎吗 - 我什么也没暗示
- You're insinuating that I'm not? - I'm not insinuating anything.

393
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:05,975
我在指控你串谋和妨碍司法公正
I'm accusing you of collusion and obstruction of justice.

394
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:08,110
不 你在口出狂言
No, you're spouting conspiracy fantasies.

395
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:10,179
- 艾德瑞斯约翰... - 是一个病人
- Idaris John... - Is a very sick man.

396
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:14,216
我不打算继续这段谈话了
And I'm not going to continue this conversation.

397
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:20,654
我觉得你们两个更需要接受治疗
If you ask me, it's the two of you who need some help.

398
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:22,190
谢谢
Thank you.

399
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:27,427
他在说谎
He's lying.

400
00:19:27,547 --> 00:19:30,198
一定是的 他很害怕 而且不只怕我们 
Definitely. And he's scared too, and not just of us.

401
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:32,566
他辅导艾德瑞斯约翰四年了
Four years he's been coaching Idaris John.

402
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:34,822
究竟什么使他这样放弃了医德良心
What do you got to pay a doctor to betray his oath like that?

403
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:35,817
问得好
Good question.

404
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:38,805
我们肯定要去查查他的财政情况 怎么了
We'll definitely check his finances. What's up?

405
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,604
你们还在布鲁克曼的办公室么 
You still at Bruckmann's office? 

406
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:41,708
正要离开 怎么了
We're just leaving now. Why?

407
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:43,911
我有理发店本的消息了
I got a response from Ben on the barbershop job.

408
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:47,247
两分钟前他在一个市场的网吧里面发了邮件
Email was sent 2 minutes ago from a web café in the market,

409
00:19:47,282 --> 00:19:49,681
就在你们附近 我把地址发过来
right near you. I'll text you the address.

410
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,552
本 把管子放下
Ben, put the pipe down.

411
00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:30,220
听我说
Listen to me.

412
00:20:30,255 --> 00:20:32,722
我知道你为什么那样做 我知道梅鲁戈
I know why you did what you did. I know about Melugo.

413
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:36,707
我需要你跟我走一趟 
I need you to come with me. 

414
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,227
我想听听你有什么想说的
I want to listen to what you have to say.

415
00:20:38,262 --> 00:20:40,363
不
No.

416
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:43,366
别再犯错了
Look, don't make another bad choice.

417
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,935
艾登 他是个当兵的
Aidan, he's a soldier,

418
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,404
用命令和恐吓胜过说服
wired for commands, intimidation over reason.

419
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:50,440
好 明白了
All right, I got this.

420
00:20:57,447 --> 00:20:59,299
本 放下管子 
Ben, I need you to put that pipe down. 

421
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,815
不 不 你退后
No. No, you stay back!

422
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,651
放下
Put it down.

423
00:21:03,686 --> 00:21:06,288
退后 我杀过人
Stay back! I've killed men before!

424
00:21:06,322 --> 00:21:09,190
伙计 听我说 放下管子
Listen to me, man, put that pipe down!

425
00:21:15,964 --> 00:21:17,965
放下 本
Put it down, Ben.

426
00:21:21,803 --> 00:21:23,804
放下管子
Put the pipe down.

427
00:21:28,142 --> 00:21:31,544
本奥马里 你被捕了
Ben Omari, you're under arrest.

428
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:39,558
本 你麻烦大了
Ben, you're - you''re facing some pretty serious charges.

429
00:21:39,594 --> 00:21:42,996
- 你差点杀了人 - 不 我给他留了活口
- You nearly killed a man. - No, I let him live.

430
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:46,934
你万幸他还活着
And you're lucky he did.

431
00:21:46,968 --> 00:21:48,469
发生了什么
What happened?

432
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:52,439
你没胆了么
Did you lose your nerve?

433
00:21:52,473 --> 00:21:55,308
不是 他更应该受折磨
Never. He should suffer.

434
00:21:55,342 --> 00:21:58,678
他应当活在恐惧中
He should live in fear.

435
00:21:58,712 --> 00:22:00,680
你确定不要那个三明治吗
You sure you don't want that sandwich?

436
00:22:00,714 --> 00:22:03,215
你要不吃我可吃了
'Cause, I mean, I'll eat it if you don't.

437
00:22:15,462 --> 00:22:18,367
跟我谈谈他吧 他的名字叫梅鲁戈 
Tell me about him. His name is Melugo, 

438
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,397
对吧
is that right?

439
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:24,435
本 我知道你过得很艰难
Ben, I know you've had a rough life.

440
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,533
我没办法想象你经历了什么 
I can't even begin to imagine what you've been through,

441
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:28,439
这些经历如何影响了...
and how it's affected...

442
00:22:28,474 --> 00:22:32,009
每个人都想让我谈以前的生活
Look, everyone wants me to talk about my life from before.

443
00:22:32,043 --> 00:22:34,011
我受够了 都过去了
I am done with that.

444
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:35,780
就这样
That is all.

445
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:38,782
你说都过去了 但是你用刀
You say you're done with it, but you just attacked a man

446
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,884
- 捅伤了一个人 - 不关你的事
- with a knife. - It's not your concern.

447
00:22:40,918 --> 00:22:45,889
我能理解淡忘一些事很难
I know it's not easy to walk away from things.

448
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:48,825
我能理解那种被不断纠缠折磨的感觉
I know what it's like to be haunted.

449
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,627
你为什么不杀他
Why didn't you kill him?

450
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,161
我本来是要杀的
I was going to!

451
00:22:58,434 --> 00:23:01,236
他让我困惑了
He made me confused.

452
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,572
他怎么让你困惑的
How did he do that?

453
00:23:03,607 --> 00:23:05,608
他不记得我了
He didn't remember me.

454
00:23:08,444 --> 00:23:10,845
他不记得你 但是...
He didn't remember you, and... and he should have

455
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,881
他应该记得 对吧
remembered you, is that right?

456
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:19,954
我过去一直听他指挥
All of those things that I did were his orders.

457
00:23:27,128 --> 00:23:29,129
本 如果你再看到他...
Ben, if you saw him again...

458
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:34,768
你还能指认他是你的司令官么
would you swear that he was your commander?

459
00:23:34,802 --> 00:23:36,803
你可以签个文书么
Would you sign a paper?

460
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,641
可以
Yes.

461
00:23:42,643 --> 00:23:45,044
我愿意
I would.

462
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:47,547
没有不敬之意 但是我不懂有什么意义
With respect, I do not see the point.

463
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:49,477
你知道我没有办法辨别他 
You know I cannot identify him. 

464
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:51,216
也许你可以辨别他的声音
Maybe you'll recognize his voice.

465
00:23:51,251 --> 00:23:53,819
他的衣服 或者仪态
An article of clothing. Maybe a mannerism.

466
00:23:53,854 --> 00:23:55,721
我明白了
I see.

467
00:23:55,756 --> 00:23:57,690
我尽力
I will try.

468
00:24:10,102 --> 00:24:11,570
那是他么
Was that him?

469
00:24:11,604 --> 00:24:13,538
是他
Yes.

470
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,076
- 你看见了吗? - 我看见了 他退缩了
- Did you see that? - I saw it. He flinched.

471
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,111
太好了 我们趁热打铁 
All right. Let's turn up the heat.

472
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:38,761
开始吧
Go ahead.

473
00:24:38,796 --> 00:24:41,864
我认识你 我认识你
I know you. I know you.

474
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:43,532
你听过他的声音吗
Do you recognize his voice?

475
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:47,869
我可能之前听过这个声音 也可能没有
It might be the voice I heard, it might not.

476
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:50,371
这一切来得太突然了
It all happened so quickly.

477
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:56,678
来 我们坐下
OK, let's sit down.

478
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,216
还有别的事情吗 警部
Is there anything else, Inspector?

479
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,751
还有一件事 
There is one thing. You say

480
00:25:03,785 --> 00:25:08,188
你说你不认识他 但是这个年轻人却认识你
you can't identify him, but this young man says he can identify you.

481
00:25:08,223 --> 00:25:10,190
- 是吗 - 是
- Oh? - Mm-hmm.

482
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:12,192
他说你是个战争罪犯
He claims you're a war criminal

483
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:14,695
并且你在他十二岁时绑架了他
and that you abducted him when he was 12 years old.

484
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,765
他知道你的名字 是什么来着
He says he knew you by the name of... what was it?

485
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,333
梅鲁戈
Melugo.

486
00:25:24,672 --> 00:25:28,174
真让人不安 太惨了
So disturbed, so sad.

487
00:25:30,477 --> 00:25:33,579
我真替这个男孩感到遗憾
I truly feel sorry for this boy.

488
00:25:33,614 --> 00:25:36,715
他袭击了你 你还真是宽宏大量
That's generous, considering he attacked you.

489
00:25:38,718 --> 00:25:42,988
我也当过童子军 你知道吗?
I was a child soldier also. Did you know that?

490
00:25:43,023 --> 00:25:46,224
我们不知道
No, we didn't.

491
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:47,926
我被征兵
I was recruited.

492
00:25:47,961 --> 00:25:49,594
我打过仗
I fought.

493
00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:52,429
我迷失过方向
I lost my way.

494
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:54,999
但是我被释放了
But I was freed.

495
00:25:55,034 --> 00:25:57,001
但你又来到这里
But you made it here.

496
00:25:57,036 --> 00:25:58,636
你现在安全了
You're safe.

497
00:25:58,671 --> 00:26:02,406
好像你已经把过去都忘记了
Seems like you've wiped the slate clean,

498
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,676
你开始了全新的生活
like you've made a whole new life.

499
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:09,680
这么说可能没用 但就我而言
It might not make a difference, but for my part,

500
00:26:09,714 --> 00:26:13,583
我一点都不想指控那个男孩
I do not wish to press any charges against that boy.

501
00:26:13,617 --> 00:26:15,285
我现在能回家了吗
May I go home now?

502
00:26:17,288 --> 00:26:18,533
他什么反应
So, how'd he react?

503
00:26:18,653 --> 00:26:22,040
艾德瑞斯无法掩饰他撒谎时的兴奋
Idaris can't hide the pleasure he takes in lying.

504
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,990
他毫无意识的笑了 
He smiles without knowing it. 

505
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:26,228
我们叫做"骗子的快乐"
We call it "Duper's Delight."

506
00:26:26,348 --> 00:26:28,779
但我们对此无计可施
Well, we can't do anything with that.

507
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:32,534
没错 但是在电梯边我们都看到了 他认识本
No. But we both saw it at the elevator. He knew Ben.

508
00:26:32,569 --> 00:26:34,536
我们发现他有一段时间表现的措手不及
We caught him off guard for a minute,

509
00:26:34,571 --> 00:26:37,206
然后在观察室里 他又恢复了冷静
and then in the observation room he was back in control.

510
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,808
那我们要离他远点
OK, so we gotta take it away from him. Rattling his cage

511
00:26:39,842 --> 00:26:41,810
然后直戳他的弱点 直到他露出马脚
until he cracks and drops his charade.

512
00:26:41,844 --> 00:26:43,344
艾登 他很会装
He's good, Aidan.

513
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:49,617
我知道这该是我的活儿 但我不知如何解决
I know this is my problem, but I don't know how to solve it.

514
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,053
我会一直监视他 他是人
I'm gonna put a fulltime tail on him. He's human,

515
00:26:52,088 --> 00:26:53,183
他一定会露出尾巴的 
he'll screw up eventually. 

516
00:26:53,184 --> 00:26:54,388
我们到时候只要在场就行
We just need to be there.

517
00:26:54,423 --> 00:26:56,389
我们可能应经被自己束缚
We may have already tipped our hand.

518
00:26:56,424 --> 00:26:58,992
如果我们步步紧逼 他可能会以新的身份逃走
We go further, he could be on a plane with a new identity.

519
00:26:59,027 --> 00:27:01,328
不 他跑了 我们也会找到他
No. He runs, we'll be on him.

520
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,615
少吃点糖 它会要了你的命
Go easy on that sugar. It's gonna kill you.

521
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:24,183
快点 我们找个座位坐下
All right, let's take a seat.

522
00:27:24,218 --> 00:27:27,285
你好 艾登 好久不见
Hey, Aidan. It's been a while.

523
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:30,588
- 是啊 - 又公务缠身了吗
- Yeah, yeah. - Working too much again?

524
00:27:30,623 --> 00:27:32,095
有一点 但是 你知道的 
Little bit. But, you know, 

525
00:27:32,096 --> 00:27:33,691
我既然来了就要做最大的努力
I'm here now, trying to make the most of it.

526
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:35,460
当然
Yeah, sure, of course.

527
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:37,462
各位
OK, everybody,

528
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:38,790
我想我们要开始了
I guess we'll get started. 

529
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:42,567
大家已经认识彼此了吧
I think everybody knows each other.

530
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:44,201
艾登
Aidan,

531
00:27:44,236 --> 00:27:46,270
看样子你有话要说
you look like you might want to say something.

532
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,839
是的
Uh, yeah, no, I do.

533
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:54,411
大家知道 我已经来这里...
Well, you know, I've been coming here for a...

534
00:27:54,445 --> 00:27:57,181
有一段时间了
for a while now, and, uh...

535
00:28:01,451 --> 00:28:03,319
嗨 你好
Hi there.

536
00:28:03,353 --> 00:28:04,988
有事吗
Everything cool?

537
00:28:05,022 --> 00:28:08,057
有人告诉我这个地方比较适合我
I met a guy that said this would be a good place for me.

538
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:10,927
当然 快进来
Yeah, sure. Of course. Come on in.

539
00:28:10,961 --> 00:28:12,461
快进来 坐下
Come on in, take a seat.

540
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,931
欢迎
Welcome.

541
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:20,958
艾登刚刚有话要说
Uh, Aidan was just gonna say something.

542
00:28:21,938 --> 00:28:23,906
是的 没关系
Yeah. Uh, you know, it's OK.

543
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,209
我可以以后说
I can wait. Um...

544
00:28:27,243 --> 00:28:28,986
老兄 不如你先来吧 
Why don't you go, man? 

545
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:31,078
告诉我们...发生了什么
Tell us what's... what's going on.

546
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,626
他是不是认出我们了
Did he just make us?

547
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,228
- 我没看出来 - 很难说
- I didn't see anything. - Hard to tell.

548
00:28:48,262 --> 00:28:50,230
就像有关这个人的所有事情一样
Like everything else with this guy.

549
00:28:50,264 --> 00:28:53,633
昨晚怎么样 发生什么事了吗
How was last night? You had a thing?

550
00:28:55,636 --> 00:28:58,371
没有 一切还算顺利
Yeah, no, it was... it was good.

551
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:00,874
你呢 你好像整晚没睡
How about you? You look like you've been up all night.

552
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,137
我上网阅读了
I went online and read every paper 

553
00:29:02,138 --> 00:29:05,211
关于保罗布鲁克曼博士的所有论文
I could find by Dr. Paul Bruckmann.

554
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,179
然后呢
And?

555
00:29:07,214 --> 00:29:09,237
时间过得真慢 
The clock thing was lazy. 

556
00:29:09,238 --> 00:29:09,815
就像用别的病人的一系列症状
So was coaching Idaris

557
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,151
来辅导艾德瑞斯
in another patient's exact set of symptoms.

558
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:14,519
他很败坏 但是不够彻底
He's corrupt, but he's not thorough.

559
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:18,990
我们若能在艾德瑞斯身上找到布鲁克曼的文件
If we can get access to Bruckmann's files on Idaris,

560
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:21,492
我发誓我可以打败他
I swear I can break him.

561
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,362
有没有人跟你说过 你已经成为一名好警察了
Anyone ever tell you you would've made a good cop?

562
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:27,531
现在有了
Not until now.

563
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:35,559
波比 出什么事了 
What's up, Poppy? 

564
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,547
你想利用布鲁克曼博士
You wanted leverage on Dr. Bruckmann. 

565
00:29:37,548 --> 00:29:38,808
我想我们成功了
I think we got it.

566
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:41,678
他每月都会从一个海外账户转账回来
Monthly transfers to him from an offshore account.

567
00:29:41,712 --> 00:29:44,348
我猜每次转账时艾德瑞斯都在这里
Let me guess, going back as long as Idaris has been here.

568
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,416
- 是的 - 我们已经发现艾德瑞斯
- Yep. - OK, so, we've got Idaris

569
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,418
付钱让医生帮他隐藏病情了
paying the doctor to help him fake his condition.

570
00:29:48,452 --> 00:29:49,995
查明这能否足够拘捕他 
Find out if that's enough for a warrant. 

571
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,420
克莉格拉正在调查此事
Caligra's looking into it.

572
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:54,123
证据转移的许可证很难搞到手
Admissible proof of the transfers is tricky.

573
00:29:54,157 --> 00:29:56,125
好吧 让里奥赶快过来
All right, get Leo and get down here.

574
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,794
你们继续监视艾德瑞斯 干的好
You guys stay with Idaris. Good work.

575
00:29:58,828 --> 00:30:00,901
那我们现在要做什么 等着吗 
So, what do we do now? Wait? 

576
00:30:00,902 --> 00:30:02,198
不 我们现在出击
No way. We hit him now.

577
00:30:02,232 --> 00:30:05,234
告诉他授权这就批下来了 让他好好想想后果
Tell him the warrant's coming and let him think through the consequences.

578
00:30:11,573 --> 00:30:14,409
- 让我进去打主场 - 没问题
- Let me take the lead in there. - You got it.

579
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:19,080
布鲁克曼博士
Dr. Bruckmann?

580
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:24,818
哦 天啊
Oh, my god.

581
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:40,532
如果艾德瑞斯发现我们在监视他
If Idaris figured out that we were on to him,

582
00:30:40,652 --> 00:30:43,474
布鲁克曼是唯一能揭示他谎言的人
Bruckmann was the only one who could testify that he was faking.

583
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,908
所以艾德瑞斯除掉了这个软肋 
So Idaris cuts the weak link. 

584
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:45,709
现在布鲁克曼死了
But now that Bruckmann's gone,

585
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,479
或许我们可以排除他的假诊断
I mean, maybe we can get rid of his phony diagnosis.

586
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:53,316
从布鲁克曼被杀的样子来看
I mean, the way Bruckmann was killed, right

587
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:57,988
就在他的桌子后面 他一定跟杀手很熟
at his desk,from behind. he had to be comfortable with the killer.

588
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:02,158
应该是他认识的人 像一个朋友 或者...
It's like it was somebody he knew, like a friend, or...

589
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,727
一个病人
Like a patient.

590
00:31:11,201 --> 00:31:13,502
弟兄们
Hey, guys.

591
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:16,171
你们看看这个
You gotta see this. Julia Grieveson,

592
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:17,913
茱莉娅格瑞维森是艾德瑞斯的员工 
the girl who works for Idaris. 

593
00:31:17,914 --> 00:31:18,874
在她父母车祸去世后
She started seeing Bruckmann

594
00:31:18,908 --> 00:31:21,276
她开始来布鲁克曼这里(做心理辅导)
after her parents died -car crash.

595
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:23,278
现在她和祖母住在一起
Now she lives with her grandmother.

596
00:31:23,313 --> 00:31:25,213
这就是线索
That's the connection.

597
00:31:25,247 --> 00:31:28,049
艾德瑞斯之前在寻找一个容易说服的年轻助手
Idaris was on the hunt for an impressionable young helper.

598
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:30,551
布鲁克曼给他和一个刚成孤儿的孩子牵线搭桥
And Bruckmann set him up with a brand-new orphan.

599
00:31:30,585 --> 00:31:34,222
他仍然利用儿童来为他效命
He's still using children to fight his battles.

600
00:31:34,256 --> 00:31:36,690
她才十六岁 你真觉得是杀了这个男人
She's 16. You really think she killed a man?

601
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:40,593
本在比她更小的时候就参加战争了
Ben was fighting a war when he was younger than that.

602
00:31:40,628 --> 00:31:42,929
你做得很好 没有在布鲁克曼博士的办公室里
You did a good job in not leaving any fingerprints

603
00:31:42,963 --> 00:31:45,698
留下指纹
in Dr. Bruckmann's office.

604
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:48,035
茱莉娅 你很聪明
You're smart, Julia.

605
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:52,639
但是你知道你每天会掉多少头发吗?
But did you know that you can lose a hundred hairs in a day?

606
00:31:54,742 --> 00:31:58,677
我们在犯罪现场的血泊里发现了一根头发
And that we found a hair in the blood at the crime scene?

607
00:31:58,711 --> 00:32:02,081
我们会证明那是你的头发
And I think we're gonna find out that that hair belongs to you.

608
00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:04,517
但我不明白的是
But what I don't understand

609
00:32:04,551 --> 00:32:07,686
你已经有一年没见到布鲁克曼博士了
is that you haven't been to see Dr. Bruckmann in a year.

610
00:32:09,689 --> 00:32:11,424
为什么要回来
So, why go back now?

611
00:32:14,527 --> 00:32:16,027
是受人指使的吗
Did someone tell you to?

612
00:32:29,374 --> 00:32:31,341
头发的事她信了吗
Did she fall for the hair thing?

613
00:32:31,376 --> 00:32:33,343
- 她什么也没说 - 她在保护他
- But she's not talking. - She's protecting him.

614
00:32:33,378 --> 00:32:35,345
他也再为她做同样的事 对吗
Oh, 'cause he'd do the same thing for her, right?

615
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,414
所以我们要让她相信
That's what we need to convince her...

616
00:32:37,449 --> 00:32:39,849
她对艾德瑞斯来说并不特别 他只是再利用她
that she's not special to Idaris, that he's using her.

617
00:32:39,884 --> 00:32:42,018
- 那我们要怎么做 - 本怎么样
- So, how do we do that? - What about Ben?

618
00:32:42,053 --> 00:32:43,140
像艾德瑞斯这样的人 
A guy like Idaris, 

619
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:44,554
这么多年来让孩子们为他效命
been bringing kids

620
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,856
也许用的都是相同的方法
under his power for years, probably uses the same methods.

621
00:32:47,891 --> 00:32:49,392
本知道是什么伎俩 
And Ben knows what they are. 

622
00:32:49,393 --> 00:32:50,893
波比 把他提审出来
Poppy, go pull him out of holding.

623
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,466
跟我说说梅鲁戈
Tell me about Melugo,

624
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,102
那个自称是艾德瑞斯约翰的男人
the man who calls himself Idaris John.

625
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:02,804
你第一次见到他是什么时候
When was the first time you saw him?

626
00:33:02,838 --> 00:33:05,474
我十二岁的时候
When I was 12.

627
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:09,311
梅鲁戈率领了一队民兵进了我们村
Melugo led a militia into my village.

628
00:33:09,345 --> 00:33:11,313
他们杀了所有成年人
They shot all the adults.

629
00:33:11,347 --> 00:33:15,183
其中有些杀手甚至比我还小
Some of them shooting were even younger than I was.

630
00:33:15,218 --> 00:33:16,783
你的父母呢
Your parents?

631
00:33:16,818 --> 00:33:19,153
我目睹了他们被杀
I saw them killed.

632
00:33:19,187 --> 00:33:21,322
我没哭
I didn't cry,

633
00:33:21,356 --> 00:33:23,857
他们把我带去营地时也没哭
not even when they took me to their camp.

634
00:33:23,891 --> 00:33:26,360
在那发生了什么事
What happened there?

635
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:38,271
他们给我们东西喝 给烟抽
They gave us things to drink and to smoke...

636
00:33:38,705 --> 00:33:41,674
直到我忘了我在哪里
until I forgot about where I was,

637
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,209
忘了我是谁
or who I was.

638
00:33:45,212 --> 00:33:48,514
他们跟我说我是个战士
They told me I was a warrior,

639
00:33:48,548 --> 00:33:51,683
告诉我说我不需要家人 他们就是我的家人
that I didn't need family, that they were my family.

640
00:33:51,717 --> 00:33:55,987
我们跟你祖母谈过了 茱莉娅
You know, we've been talking to your grandmother, Julia, and, um...

641
00:33:56,022 --> 00:33:59,791
她可没说什么好话
she didn't have a lot of nice things to say.

642
00:33:59,825 --> 00:34:02,961
她说你从开始为艾德瑞斯工作就变了
She said you changed when you started working for Idaris.

643
00:34:02,995 --> 00:34:06,297
你跟她断绝来往 是真的吗
You closed off from her. Is that true?

644
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:09,133
她若这么说 那一定就是了
If she says so, it must be.

645
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:12,637
艾德瑞斯有没有跟你说你不再需要她了
Did Idaris tell you that you didn't need her anymore?

646
00:34:12,671 --> 00:34:15,173
他才是你唯一需要的家人
That he was the only family that you needed?

647
00:34:15,207 --> 00:34:18,176
反正她从未想要过我
She never wanted me anyway.

648
00:34:21,011 --> 00:34:24,347
她还告诉我们说你吸毒了
She also told us that you got into drugs.

649
00:34:24,382 --> 00:34:28,185
她拿到了一份检测报告
She got one of those tests,

650
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:31,921
就是你送去化验的 并被发现有冰毒
where you send it to the lab, and they found methamphetamine,

651
00:34:31,955 --> 00:34:33,590
大麻和可卡因
marijuana, cocaine.

652
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:38,561
是艾德瑞斯给你的吗
Did Idaris get those for you?

653
00:34:45,034 --> 00:34:47,002
你根本不明白
You don't understand.

654
00:34:47,036 --> 00:34:48,671
第一次
The first time,


655
00:34:48,705 --> 00:34:51,873
梅鲁戈让我和另外一个男孩在一个房间
Melugo put me into a room with another boy.

656
00:34:51,908 --> 00:34:55,243
那个男孩曾试图逃跑
A boy who had tried to escape him.

657
00:34:55,277 --> 00:34:58,646
梅鲁戈 也就是 艾德瑞斯
Melugo - Idaris...

658
00:35:00,649 --> 00:35:02,950
他给了我一把弯刀
he gave me a machete.

659
00:35:02,984 --> 00:35:05,286
然后他带着汽油出去了
He went outside with gasoline.

660
00:35:05,321 --> 00:35:08,455
他说我有五分钟的时间提着那个男孩的脚出来
He said I had 5 minutes to come out with the boy's feet,

661
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:10,490
不然就把我们都烧死
or he would burn us both.

662
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:18,465
如你所见 医生 我没被烧死
As you can see, Doctor, I have no burns.

663
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:21,868
他有没有告诉你他为何这样做
Did he tell you why he did that?

664
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:25,003
他说如果我杀生够多
He told me if I killed enough times...

665
00:35:27,006 --> 00:35:30,409
我就该学会不哭
that I would learn not to cry,

666
00:35:30,444 --> 00:35:32,945
从我杀死的人身上汲取力量
that I would take the strength of those who I had killed.

667
00:35:34,948 --> 00:35:37,650
我们还在你的花园棚里发现了些东西
We also found some things in your garden shed.

668
00:35:37,684 --> 00:35:40,252
你知道我说的是什么吗
Do you know what I'm talking about?

669
00:35:40,286 --> 00:35:42,287
动物的骨骼
Animal skeletons.

670
00:35:44,523 --> 00:35:45,990
老鼠 松鼠
Rats, squirrels...

671
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:48,360
还有猫
a cat.

672
00:35:50,763 --> 00:35:52,864
看样子它们都是被杀死的
They all looked like they had been killed.

673
00:35:58,803 --> 00:36:02,306
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

674
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,142
是艾德瑞斯让你这么做的吗
Did Idaris tell you to do that?

675
00:36:07,145 --> 00:36:11,649
你杀得够多 就学会不再哭泣
That if you did it enough times, you'd learn not to cry?

676
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:17,019
是他告诉你要从那些动物身上汲取力量吗
Did he tell you that you'd take on the strength of those animals?

677
00:36:17,053 --> 00:36:21,190
因为那是个谎言 茱莉娅 我觉得你是知道的
Because that's a lie, Julia, and I think you know it.

678
00:36:21,224 --> 00:36:26,196
他在别的地方跟其他孩子也说这个谎
And that's a lie that he's told other kids in other places.

679
00:36:28,698 --> 00:36:31,300
我知道他跟你说你是特别的
And I know that he told you that you are special,

680
00:36:31,334 --> 00:36:32,934
但你确实是特别的 茱莉娅
and you are special, Julia,

681
00:36:32,968 --> 00:36:34,869
不过不是对他而言
but not to him.

682
00:36:37,674 --> 00:36:41,443
我每天跟罪犯打交道
I deal with people who commit crimes every day.

683
00:36:41,477 --> 00:36:42,944
有一些
Some...

684
00:36:42,978 --> 00:36:45,646
是好人做了坏事
are good people who have done bad things,

685
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:48,081
而另外一些
but others...

686
00:36:53,021 --> 00:36:57,425
多数精神病学家不相信善恶
Most psychiatrists don't believe in good and evil.

687
00:36:57,459 --> 00:36:59,026
但是我信
But I do.

688
00:37:01,028 --> 00:37:02,995
并且据我所知
And the one thing I have learned

689
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,398
善恶之间并无高墙
is there is no great wall between them.

690
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:09,068
如果你能跨步出线
If you can step over the line...

691
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,871
那么也能退后
You can step back.

692
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:16,875
我知道你是个好人
I know you're a good person.

693
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:19,110
我也知道如果不是为了艾德瑞斯
And I know you wouldn't have done these things

694
00:37:19,145 --> 00:37:20,979
你也不会做这些事情
if it wasn't for Idaris,

695
00:37:22,982 --> 00:37:25,650
但是我要听你说出来
But I need to hear it from you.

696
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:31,504
他跟我说这是保护他
He told me that it was the only way 

697
00:37:31,505 --> 00:37:34,325
免受敌人迫害的唯一方式
to protect him from his enemies.

698
00:37:45,169 --> 00:37:47,671
他告诉我必须杀死布鲁克曼医生
He told me I had to kill Dr. Bruckmann.

699
00:38:08,992 --> 00:38:10,960
监视汇报说艾德瑞斯出门了
Surveillance said Idaris just left his house,

700
00:38:10,994 --> 00:38:12,719
去了茱莉娅家 跟祖母谈了一下
went to Julia's, spoke to the grandmother, 

701
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,963
现在他向西奔着邓达斯去了
now he's headed west on Dundas.

702
00:38:13,997 --> 00:38:16,132
他要逃跑 或许会去机场方向
He's gonna make a run for it. Probably headed to the airport.

703
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:19,100
我打赌 是信用社 他要跑路 一定需要钱
My bet, the credit union. If he's gonna rabbit, he'll need money.

704
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:20,636
我们去那儿
Let's get there.

705
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,179
- 进展如何 - 他要出来了
- How we doing? - He's coming out now.

706
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,550
现在你认识我了吗
You recognize me now?

707
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,154
艾登 艾登 抓住他了
Aidan! Aidan, I got him!

708
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,525
抓住他了
I got him.

709
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:27,487
# 你咆哮发出的回音 #
The echo to your yell

710
00:40:27,522 --> 00:40:31,592
# 你潜水产生的涟漪 #
The ripple to your dive

711
00:40:32,626 --> 00:40:37,598
# 你摇摆下的涌流 #
The currents under your wave

712
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:40,267
你是茱莉娅吗
You're Julia?

713
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:43,670
对
Yes.

714
00:40:43,704 --> 00:40:46,306
你吓坏了
You're frightened.

715
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,188
谢谢
Thank you.

716
00:41:02,222 --> 00:41:05,757
如果你愿意 我可以去探望你
And I could come to visit you, if you like.

717
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:09,695
好 我很愿意
Yeah, I would.

718
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:12,764
来吧 茱莉娅
Come on, Julia.

719
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:14,300
该走了
It's time to go.

720
00:41:16,969 --> 00:41:20,305
# 我能感觉到你 #
I could feel you

721
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:23,874
# 包围着我 #
All around me

722
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,718
要把她怎么着
What will happen to her?

723
00:41:34,752 --> 00:41:36,720
她还未成年
Well, she's a minor,

724
00:41:36,754 --> 00:41:39,889
而且会考虑艾德瑞斯的影响因素
and Idaris' influence will be taken into account,

725
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:42,759
所以她仍有机会享受美好人生
so she's still got a chance at a good life.

726
00:41:42,793 --> 00:41:44,794
你也一样 本
So do you, Ben.

727
00:41:47,164 --> 00:41:50,366
所以我才逃跑 所以我才来这里
That is why I escaped, why I came here.

728
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:54,737
我已经没机会了
I haven't had the chance yet.

729
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:56,739
本 我们已经跟检察官谈过了
Ben, we've been talking to the prosecutors.

730
00:41:56,773 --> 00:41:59,775
他们会重新定罪
They're going to reconsider the charges.

731
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:00,777
可是与此同时
But in the meantime, 

732
00:42:00,778 --> 00:42:02,945
你必须得去做些心理辅导
you're going to have to get some counselling.

733
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,646
多倾诉
More talk.

734
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,650
倾诉不是软弱 本 躲藏才是
Talking is not a weakness, Ben; hiding is.

735
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,289
我安排人来做你的倾诉对象
I'll make some arrangements to find someone for you to talk with.

736
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:17,272
在此之前 你若愿意参加小组倾诉 
And until then, if you want to just sit in on a group.

737
00:42:17,273 --> 00:42:20,494
也可以 交给我
It's OK. Uh... I got it.

738
00:42:22,497 --> 00:42:25,332
艾登 你今天带了个朋友啊
Aidan, you brought a friend today.

739
00:42:25,367 --> 00:42:27,834
对 各位 这是本
Yeah. Everyone, this is Ben.

740
00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:29,170
你好 本
Hi, Ben.

741
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,641
你当过兵吗
You were a soldier?

742
00:42:35,643 --> 00:42:39,245
对 在刚果民主共和国
Yes. In the Democratic Republic of Congo.

743
00:42:41,848 --> 00:42:45,017
对 本是来 他只是来倾听的
Yeah, Ben's just... he's just here to listen.

744
00:42:45,052 --> 00:42:48,754
好吧 如果本是来倾听的
Well, if Ben's going to listen, 

745
00:42:48,755 --> 00:42:50,557
那他得有倾听对象啊
he's going to need someone to listen to.

746
00:42:50,591 --> 00:42:52,957
有人想说说吗
Does anyone have anything to say?

747
00:42:52,992 --> 00:42:55,294
有 我有话要说
Yeah. I'll go.

748
00:42:58,231 --> 00:43:01,099
我已经越来越好 进步很多
you know, I've been doing better. A lot better.

749
00:43:01,133 --> 00:43:04,769
但是这周 由于某些原因
Uh... but this week, for some reason,

750
00:43:04,804 --> 00:43:07,038
那种感觉又回来了
it's been coming back on me, and...

751
00:43:07,073 --> 00:43:09,807
每当我睡觉时
when I sleep...

752
00:43:09,841 --> 00:43:11,475
如果我睡着了
if I sleep - uh...

753
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:16,213
那些最糟糕的事就回来了
the worst things come back.

754
00:43:16,247 --> 00:43:18,248
想跟我们谈谈那些最糟糕的事吗 艾登
Do you want to tell us about the worst things, Aidan?

755
00:43:18,282 --> 00:43:19,705
可是 没什么新鲜的
Well, I mean, it's nothing new. 

756
00:43:19,706 --> 00:43:21,218
你们以前都听过
You guys have heard it all before.

757
00:43:21,252 --> 00:43:23,253
他没听过
He hasn't.

758
00:43:23,287 --> 00:43:26,089
# 从未见过你 #
Never saw you

759
00:43:26,123 --> 00:43:30,992
# 从未听过你消息 #
Never heard you

760
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:33,895
# 可我知道你就在那里 #
But I knew that you were there
