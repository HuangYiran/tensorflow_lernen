1
00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:09,917
他悠扬婉转的声音让所有人卸下心防 也没有人能够看穿歌声的出处

2
00:00:12,302 --> 00:00:15,311
六个月前

3
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:17,790
你到底是怎么了
What the hell is the matter with you?

4
00:00:18,657 --> 00:00:20,430
你怎么敢就这样跑开
Don't you dare run away from me.

5
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,960
请不要伤害我 求你了
Please, don't hurt me!

6
00:00:22,782 --> 00:00:25,670
我告诉过你要穿黑色裙子
I told you to wear the black dress.

7
00:00:25,702 --> 00:00:27,050
已经送洗了
It's at the cleaners!

8
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:28,990
而且 你喜欢这条裙子
Besides, you like this dress.

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,982
你总是说我穿着它有多么好看
You always said how good I looked in it.

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,400
黑色能将你衬托的更美
You look better in black.

11
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:35,768
我再戴点儿装饰
I'll put on something else.

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,932
这就是你的问题
That's your whole problem.

13
00:00:37,475 --> 00:00:40,410
当我告诉你做什么的时候
When I tell you to do something,

14
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:43,120
你就该这样去做
you should just do it!

15
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:45,808
啊 不要打我
Aah! Don't hit me!

16
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:46,834
不要伤害我
Don't hurt me!

17
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:12,511
喔 老天爷
Oh, my God.

18
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:14,939
911报警中心
911.

19
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,462
你有什么紧急情况
What is your emergency?

20
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,377
是的 我们需要一辆救护车
Yes. We need an ambulance.

21
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:27,666
- 早安  - 嗨
- Morning. - Hey.

22
00:01:28,684 --> 00:01:32,240
我想了想昨晚我们的谈话
So I... I've been thinking about what we talked about last night.

23
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,617
- 关于Juliette的  - 是
- Juliette? - Yeah.

24
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:37,951
我觉得你该带她去拖车看看
And I think that you should take her to the trailer.

25
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:39,290
难道你不觉得你才应该带她去吗
Don't you think you should be the one who...

26
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,968
不 现在你跟她处得更好
No, you're on better terms with her right now.

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,206
也许吧 但这是你们俩之间的事儿 而不是我和她的
Well, maybe, but isn't this more of a you-and-her thing than a me-and-her thing?

28
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:47,544
如果去房车能帮她恢复记忆
If going to the trailer helps bring back her memories,

29
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,310
她就有可能会想起所有的事儿
then there's a chance that she's gonna remember everything.

30
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,573
也可能会像第一次去那样糟
And it could go as badly as it did the first time.

31
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:54,860
但是如果你带她去
But if you take her to the trailer...

32
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:56,201
噢 我明白了
Oh, I get it.

33
00:01:56,723 --> 00:01:58,480
所以如果我疯了就没什么大不了的
So if I'm crazy, no big deal.

34
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:00,550
我们总不会都疯了吧
Hey, well, we can't both be crazy.

35
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,604
为什么不会
Why not?

36
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:05,546
我的意思是 考虑到我们以她的立场谈过的事情
I mean, given what we're talking about,from her point of view.

37
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:06,800
这值得一试
It's worth a try.

38
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,309
要是她想起所有的事情怎么办
What if she does remember everything?

39
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,410
我是指 所有事情
I mean, everything.

40
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:11,193
那我怎么应付过去
How am I supposed to finagle that?

41
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:14,114
就做你该做的事儿
Just do whatever you have to do.

42
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:16,580
我知道这个要求有些过分
I know this is asking a lot,

43
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,751
但是Monroe 拜托了 就当是为了我
but, Monroe, please, for me.

44
00:02:28,702 --> 00:02:29,606
多谢
Thank you.

45
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,850
毋庸置疑
And the people will prove beyond any doubt

46
00:02:38,222 --> 00:02:40,389
十月十六日晚
that on the night of October 16th,

47
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:45,398
被告Donald Nidaria蓄谋杀害了
the defendant Donald Nidaria did willfully and with malice aforethought,

48
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,695
他新婚六个月的妻子Katherine
murder Katherine, his wife of only six months.

49
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,730
现在我们将听到被告的开庭陈述
We will now hear opening statements from the defense.

50
00:02:54,935 --> 00:02:55,798
Kellogg先生 请
Mr. Kellogg.

51
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:01,300
陪审团的各位成员
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

52
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:04,720
六个月前 我的委托人Donald Nidaria
six months ago, my client Donald Nidaria

53
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:07,206
经历了一场难以想像的悲剧
suffered an unimaginable tragedy.

54
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,160
他挚爱的妻子Katherine
His beloved wife Katherine,

55
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:16,820
尽管他尽其所能为她提供极其需要的精神治疗
despite all his heroic efforts to provide her the psychiatric care she so badly needed,

56
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:22,260
还是屈服于她黑暗的本性
succumbed to the demons of her darker nature...

57
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:27,810
纠缠她多年的恶魔
demons that had been with her for so many years,

58
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:31,492
唆使她跳下卧室的阳台
driving her to commit suicide at their home

59
00:03:32,055 --> 00:03:36,500
走向自杀
by leaping to her death from their bedroom balcony.

60
00:03:36,991 --> 00:03:40,918
在这场悲剧中更加令人感到侮辱的是
To add insult to this terrible injury,

61
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:46,710
我的委托人被逮捕 错误地被指控为谋杀犯
my client was arrested and wrongfully charged with murder.

62
00:03:48,516 --> 00:03:51,890
女士们 先生们
Murder, ladies and gentlemen,

63
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:57,693
被指控谋杀了他愿意为其付出生命的女子
of the woman he loved more than life itself.

64
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:10,830
- 你好  - 嗨 Juliette
- Hello? - Hey, Juliette.

65
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:12,549
我是Monroe
It's me, Monroe.

66
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:16,309
我一直在想着拖车的事情
I've been doing some thinking about the trailer, and...

67
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:18,806
我想也许我可以带你去
I think maybe I should take you,

68
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:20,706
我的意思是如果你仍然想去的话
I mean, if you still wanna go

69
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:21,808
并且你也不忙得话
and if you're not busy.

70
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,200
我是说你可能会很忙
I mean, you know, you could be busy.

71
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:26,400
Juliette 还在听吗
Juliette?

72
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,210
不 我仍然想去
No, I-I... I still wanna go.

73
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:29,850
什么时候
When?

74
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:31,909
现在就可以出发
I'm sort of ready right now.

75
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,203
- 好的  - 我是说就是现在
- Okay. - I mean, right now,

76
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,686
因为我正站在你房门前
as in I'm standing on your front porch.

77
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:48,208
如果这个能帮你恢复记忆
Look, if this is gonna help bring your memories back...

78
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:50,413
喔 好吧
oh, okay.

79
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,838
发生了什么
What's wrong?

80
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:55,286
没什么 我只是没想到你会这么做
Nothing. I just didn't think you'd do it.

81
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:57,113
真的吗 因为我
Really? Because I...

82
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
在改变主意前我们赶紧出发
we're going before anybody changes their mind.

83
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:00,507
好
Okay.

84
00:05:22,153 --> 00:05:24,280
我完全记得来过这里
I totally remember being here.

85
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:25,721
当时天在下雨
It was raining.

86
00:05:26,511 --> 00:05:28,111
你记得Nick陪着你吗
Do you remember Nick being with you?

87
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:33,603
没有 我只记得我当时很沮丧
No, I just remember being really upset.

88
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:37,920
你确定你想这么做
You sure you wanna do this?

89
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,690
恩
Yes.

90
00:05:57,606 --> 00:05:58,817
有想起什么吗
Any bells ringing?

91
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,314
还没
Not yet.

92
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:04,302
好吧 慢慢想
Well, take your time.

93
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,532
不要强求
Don't force it.

94
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,560
你认识Marie姑妈吗
Did you know aunt Marie?

95
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,095
我在医院遇到过一次
I met her once in the hospital.

96
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,342
那可能是在她遇袭之后
That would've been after she was attacked.

97
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,904
你还记得那件事儿
So you remember that?

98
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,107
恩 我听到枪声跑出屋 看到她
Yeah, I heard the gunshots,and I ran outside, and I saw her...

99
00:06:20,803 --> 00:06:22,601
看到她正躺在街上
saw her lying in the street.

100
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:25,558
怎么
What?

101
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,806
我就在这里见他
That's where I've been seeing him.

102
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:37,200
喔 天哪 我想起来了
Oh, my God. I remember him.

103
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,900
他坐在这张桌子前
He was sitting at this desk.

104
00:06:38,935 --> 00:06:40,300
- 你记得Nick  - 是的 他
- You remember Nick? - Yes, he...

105
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:41,648
他正在找一些东西
he was looking for something,

106
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,690
但这都是Marie姑妈的书
but these are aunt Marie's books.

107
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:48,302
她在干什么
What was she doing?

108
00:06:49,457 --> 00:06:51,460
她怎么会有这些东西
Why would she even have all this stuff?

109
00:06:51,613 --> 00:06:53,022
这个问题问得好极了
That's a really good question,

110
00:06:53,502 --> 00:06:54,608
呃
and, um,

111
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:57,206
也需要个好答案
it deserves a really good answer.

112
00:06:59,808 --> 00:07:02,466
我想Marie姑妈是个收藏爱好者
I guess you could say aunt Marie was a bit of a collector.

113
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:05,109
这些画可真奇怪
These drawings are so weird.

114
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:07,102
你知道他们是什么吗
Do you know what they are?

115
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:16,810
看起来她像是对民间传说很感兴趣
Uh, well, it appears she was into some sort of,uh, folkish-lore.

116
00:07:17,716 --> 00:07:18,966
你是指童话故事
You mean like fairy tales?

117
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,704
恩 当然
Yeah, sure.

118
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:23,307
你 你也可以这样想
You could... you could go there.

119
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,886
那里面有什么
What's in there?

120
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:26,480
也许是类似的东西吧
Probably just more of the same.

121
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:32,880
并不是
Not really.

122
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:35,700
哇哦 看看这些武器
Wow. Look at all the weapons.

123
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,092
她可真是个收藏家 是吧
She really was a hell of a collector, huh?

124
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:42,817
为什么把这些东西放在拖车里
Why put all of this stuff in a trailer

125
00:07:42,843 --> 00:07:44,443
并且一直带着它到处走
and haul it around with you?

126
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,147
为什么Nick不把它们处理了
And why didn't Nick just get rid of it all?

127
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:52,000
可能就像是家传宝物之类的东西吧
It's probably just, like,a family heirloom sort of thing,

128
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:53,906
传了很多代
passed down over generations.

129
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,831
我觉得今天已经做得很不错了
Well, I think this was a terrific success.

130
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,400
你记得Nick曾经在这里
You remember Nick being here.

131
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,405
我觉得这也许是个恢复的起点
And I think this might be the beginning of the road to recovery.

132
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:03,906
你现在想要离开
W...whoa, whoa, whoa. You wanna leave?

133
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:06,504
是啊 怎么 你不想吗
Yeah. What, you don't?

134
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:09,798
这里有太多可看的
There is so much more to this.

135
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:12,500
你不会想读到太多可能不在这儿的东西
Now you don't wanna go reading too much into what might not be here.

136
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:14,110
那这些奇奇怪怪的小瓶子呢
What about all these weird little bottles?

137
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,341
里边有什么 什么是
What's in them? What's...?

138
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,680
Siegbarste礼物 这是什么
"Siegbarste gift." What's that?

139
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,973
可能只是某种香水吧
It's probably just some perfume.

140
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:22,209
我是说 上边写着 礼物 所以
I mean, it says "Gift," So...

141
00:08:22,695 --> 00:08:23,913
不要打开
Don't...

142
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,800
噢
Oh!

143
00:08:25,603 --> 00:08:26,904
我的老天爷 这绝不是个礼物
Oh, my God. That's no gift.

144
00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:28,510
是啊 你也许该把它放回去
Yeah, you might wanna put that one back.

145
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:29,600
你看到这些书了吗
You see these books?

146
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,000
里面全是图画
They're filled with drawings

147
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,790
我的先祖和其他人画的 那些人
made by my ancestors and others who had...

148
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:36,410
- Juliette  - 有着相同的能力
- Juliette? - The same ability.

149
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,787
都是格林生物的图画
And the drawings are of wesen.

150
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:44,400
首先你要把它浸入到这个东西里边去 就在这边 这个Siegbarste毒药
First, you have to dip it in this stuff right here... siegbarste gift.

151
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,561
Gift在德语中是毒药的意思
"Gift" Means "Poison" In German

152
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:47,400
他们在进行着一次非法的战斗
they were running an illegal fighting ring...

153
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:49,210
- 你还好吗  - 角斗士的年代
- Are you okay? - Time of the gladiators.

154
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:51,203
用这些来战斗
Fighting with these.

155
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:53,200
古代的武器 看 这是
Ancient weapons. Look. This...

156
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,100
当它们穿过一种叫woge的东西时
When they go through something called the woge...

157
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:56,330
是一颗晨星
Is a morning star.

158
00:08:57,686 --> 00:08:59,314
这里边还有一把来复枪
There's a rifle in here

159
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,224
射出特殊的子弹
that shoots special bullets...

160
00:09:03,606 --> 00:09:04,904
Juliette 你怎么了
Juliette, what's wrong?

161
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:09,203
Juliette
Juliette?

162
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,500
发生了什么
What happened?

163
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,300
- 我不知道  - 你还好吧
- I don't know. - Are you okay?

164
00:09:16,107 --> 00:09:19,401
应该还好吧
II think so.

165
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:22,410
我不得不问问
I'm a little afraid to ask,

166
00:09:22,507 --> 00:09:26,800
你在里面到底看到了什么
but what exactly did you see in there?

167
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,001
我看到了Nick
I saw Nick...

168
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,304
也许我该说我看到了好多Nick
maybe I should say I saw nicks.

169
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,024
我看到他 到处都看到了
I saw him... Everywhere.

170
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,852
你在说什么 不止一个Nick
What do you mean? More than one?

171
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,144
是的 然后他们
Yes, and then they were...

172
00:09:39,697 --> 00:09:41,408
他们都同时在说话
they were all talking at the same time.

173
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,421
我不明白他们任何一个人的话
And I didn't understand what any of them were saying.

174
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:47,415
好了 我们也许没有用对方法
Okay. We might not be doing this right.

175
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:50,781
我是说 记忆可能是有些微妙的
I mean, memories can be kinda tricky.

176
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:53,203
我的记忆就像是地狱一样
Mine sure as hell are.

177
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:55,293
我想回家了
I think I just want to go home.

178
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:55,987
好的
Okay.

179
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:04,498
Rosalee
Rosalee?

180
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,760
在这儿
Back here.

181
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:08,060
我原本打算在G.K.那边定个位子
I tried to get us a table at G.K.'s,

182
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:09,561
但他们不接受预订
but they won't take a reservation

183
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:11,637
除非你要开一个19人大派对
unless you're a party of, like, 19, so...

184
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:13,977
我今晚不是很想出去玩
I don't really feel like going out tonight.

185
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:16,121
怎么啦 你病了吗
What's the matter? You sick?

186
00:10:17,305 --> 00:10:18,223
可能吧
I'm something.

187
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,776
我觉得你没发烧啊
Doesn't feel like you have a fever.

188
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:27,881
今天陪审团工作如何 你去了没
How was jury duty? Did you even go?

189
00:10:28,398 --> 00:10:29,073
呃 我去了
Oh, I went.

190
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:30,650
大概进行到一半的时候
About halfway through,

191
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:31,825
我开始感到不大舒服
I started feeling not so good.

192
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,929
或许你应该请病假
Maybe you should call in sick.

193
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:36,150
反正他们有替补
I mean, they have alternates.

194
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:38,374
嗯 我会看看我明天感觉如何
Mm, I'll see how I feel tomorrow.

195
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:39,367
我觉得我只是
I think I'm just...

196
00:10:40,345 --> 00:10:41,605
只是在生自己的气
I'm just mad at myself.

197
00:10:42,326 --> 00:10:43,317
为啥 你做了什么吗
Why, what'd you do?

198
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,092
一开始 我是这样认为这个案子的
I started out feeling one way about the case,

199
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:48,660
然后我突然就有了完全相反的想法
and then I went completely in the other direction.

200
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,080
哇 看来那是个很厉害的律师啊
Wow. Sounds like someone's a hell of a lawyer.

201
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:53,460
也许吧
I guess.

202
00:10:54,084 --> 00:10:56,542
在那儿的时候 我以为自己病了
But when I was there, I thought I was getting sick.

203
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:58,174
一离开那地方 就感觉好点了
Once I left, I started feeling better,

204
00:10:58,209 --> 00:10:59,490
现在 我只是有点头痛
and now, I just have a headache.

205
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:01,663
要不你回家睡一觉吧
Why don't you go home and go to bed?

206
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,341
- 我来关门  - 嗯
- I'll close up. - Mm.

207
00:11:03,403 --> 00:11:04,809
那再好不过了
I'd appreciate that.

208
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:07,086
嗯 谢谢
Mm, thank you.

209
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,123
你是最贴心的
You're the best.

210
00:11:11,224 --> 00:11:13,187
嘿 我明天开车载你去法院好吗
Hey, how about I drive you to court tomorrow?

211
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,520
我很乐意 晚安
I'd like that. Night.

212
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,356
晚安
Night.

213
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:29,132
哇
Wow!

214
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:30,550
闻起来好棒
Smells good.

215
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:32,335
我不知道你还会烧菜诶
I didn't know you could cook.

216
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:36,640
呃 我不会烧 这是外卖
Oh, I, uh... I can't, this is take-out.

217
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:39,053
你现在不是应该和Rosalee你侬我侬吗
Weren't you supposed to be on a date with Rosalee?

218
00:11:39,322 --> 00:11:41,242
是啊 但她身体不舒服 所以
Yeah, she didn't feel so good, so...

219
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:43,220
你在读什么
what are you reading?

220
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:44,703
信不信由你
Believe it or not,

221
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:48,261
我刚收到一封来自我妈妈的电子邮件
I think I just got an email from my mom.

222
00:11:49,753 --> 00:11:50,768
不是吧
Seriously?

223
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:52,811
信上写了什么
What does it say?

224
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,954
"抱歉 这么久没联系你
"Sorry to be off the radar for so long.

225
00:11:57,815 --> 00:12:00,090
"我想你 我一切都好
"I miss you. All is well.

226
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,893
"我会好好规划那笔钱的
"I plan to spend the money wisely.

227
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:05,965
爱你的 妈妈"
Love, mom."

228
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:08,278
这是暗号 对吗
That's code, right?

229
00:12:08,692 --> 00:12:10,037
她是指那些硬币
She's talking about the coins.

230
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:11,235
哇
Wow.

231
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,388
嗯 我觉得这是件好事
Well, that's a good thing, I guess.

232
00:12:14,696 --> 00:12:16,302
这让我想起 嗯
Which reminds me, um...

233
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,015
我带Juliette去拖车那边了
I took Juliette to the trailer.

234
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:22,670
然后呢
And?

235
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,710
实际上她记得在拖车里
She actually remembered seeing you

236
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:26,823
见过你
in the trailer.

237
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,099
她记得我
She remembered me?

238
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:30,394
只记得在拖车里的情景而已
Just in the trailer.

239
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:33,150
这是一个开端 对吧
Well, that's a start, right?

240
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:34,590
嗯 这的确是个开端
Oh, it's definitely a start,

241
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,864
不过她看见无数个你
except she saw a whole lot of you,

242
00:12:38,055 --> 00:12:40,320
像是 到处都是
like all over the place,

243
00:12:40,516 --> 00:12:42,430
同时在说话
all talking at the same time.

244
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:44,246
神马
What?

245
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:46,676
她的记忆一定是试图浮现
Her memory is definitely trying to come back.

246
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,163
但是
But...

247
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:49,905
我觉得我们现在应该做的
I think the best thing for us to do right now

248
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,292
是顺其自然
is just stay out of the way.

249
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,676
不 我要和她谈谈
No, I need to talk to her.

250
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,840
你已经在她脑中整天说个没完了
You've been talking to her all day in her head, man.

251
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,396
她现在应该已经烦死你了吧
I think she's kinda Nick'd out.

252
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,699
如果我们给她压力
I think it might actually be dangerous for her

253
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:02,216
可能会给她带来危险
if we try to push it.

254
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,405
你很痛苦

255
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:10,700
鉴于你的经历

256
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:14,561
我们需要谈谈

257
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:15,360
Juliette 我没法告诉你所有的细节
Juliette, I can't tell you how it all fits together.

258
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,437
你在已知与未知之间挣扎
Juliette 我没法告诉你所有的细节
Juliette, I can't tell you how it all fits together.

259
00:13:17,437 --> 00:13:19,752
你在已知与未知之间挣扎

260
00:13:19,752 --> 00:13:20,346
这注定要发生
It was destined to happen.
你在已知与未知之间挣扎

261
00:13:20,346 --> 00:13:20,741
这注定要发生
It was destined to happen.

262
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:20,961
你的世界正在支离破碎
这注定要发生
It was destined to happen.

263
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:23,955
你的世界正在支离破碎

264
00:13:24,224 --> 00:13:25,189
这里有支来复枪
There's a rifle in here.

265
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,338
Juliette
Juliette!

266
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:46,167
Vera 请告诉法庭当时你到底听到了什么
Now, Vera, please tell the court exactly what you heard.

267
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,126
我听见Nidaria女士对他大喊
I heard Mrs. Nidaria yelling for him

268
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:50,040
不要伤害她
not to hurt her.

269
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:51,925
然后你做了什么
What did you do then?

270
00:13:52,502 --> 00:13:53,509
我冲进了卧室
I rushed to the bedroom.

271
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:54,868
你看见了什么
And what did you see?

272
00:13:57,341 --> 00:14:00,547
我看见Nidaria先生抓着Nidaria女士
I saw Mr. Nidaria grab Mrs. Nidaria...

273
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:06,670
然后将她扔下了阳台
And throw her right off the balcony.

274
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:08,980
非常可怕
It was horrible.

275
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,220
谢谢 没有更多问题了
Thank you. No further questions.

276
00:14:22,313 --> 00:14:23,670
早上好 Montgomery女士
Good morning, Ms. Montgomery.

277
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:25,900
你能告诉法庭你在Nidaria先生
Can you tell the court how long you've been employed

278
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:27,304
的家里做管家多久了吗
as Mr. Nidaria's housekeeper?

279
00:14:27,485 --> 00:14:28,674
两年多
Just over two years.

280
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,640
你说你看见我的当事人抓住
You say you saw my client grab

281
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:36,570
- 她的妻子 是吗  - 是的
- his wife, is that correct? - Yes.

282
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,415
我当事人的证词表明
My client's sworn testimony states

283
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,470
他的妻子 当时歇斯底里

284
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:46,209
尽管他做了最大努力 但仍然没能阻止她
And despite his best efforts, she through herself...

285
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,436
跳下阳台
Off the bedroom balcony.

286
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,043
现在 我想请你
Now, I ask you

287
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:54,700
再回想一次当时的情景
to go back to that moment one more time.

288
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:58,455
你听见了喊声
You heard shouting.

289
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,035
你跑进房间
You ran into the room.

290
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:03,059
- 别过来  - 快回屋里来
- Stay back! - Please come back inside.

291
00:15:03,714 --> 00:15:04,995
Katherine 不要
Katherine, no!

292
00:15:07,163 --> 00:15:08,710
我的上帝啊 不
Please, God, no.

293
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:14,861
你看见了什么
And what did you see?

294
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:17,041
我觉得
II think...

295
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,992
我只是想帮她
I was only trying to help her.

296
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,812
他曾试图去帮她
He was trying to help her.

297
00:15:23,164 --> 00:15:23,909
反对
Objection.

298
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:26,448
法官大人 辩护人正在诱导证人
Your honor, the defense is leading the witness.

299
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,535
法官大人 我只是去确认一下
Your honor, I'm simply trying to confirm

300
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,250
在悲剧发生的那个晚上
what the witness actually saw

301
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,332
目击证人到底看见了什么
on the evening of this tragic accident.

302
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:34,900
法官大人 辩护人并不是在确认什么
Your honor, the defense isn't confirming anything.

303
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,298
他是在向证人暗示证词
He's suggesting testimony to the witness.

304
00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:39,128
辩护人请上前
Counsel will please approach the bench.

305
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,572
我会让她的回答有效
I'm going to let the answer stand

306
00:15:46,603 --> 00:15:48,800
以便于查清那晚到底发生了什么
in the interest of finding out what happened that night.

307
00:15:49,224 --> 00:15:52,670
但是 下次请
But... Be more careful in how you phrase your questions

308
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:53,420
更小心地组织你提问时的措辞
when we proceed.

309
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,496
当然了 法官大人
Of course, your honor.

310
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:55,962
谢谢
Thank you.

311
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,772
现在休庭一小时 午休

317
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,720
- 他在这做什么  - 根据报告
- What's he doing here? - According to the report,

318
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:46,080
他来是为了运送一个爆炸装置

319
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,043
给太平洋西北部地区的某个人
to someone in the pacific northwest.

320
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,704
听起来很不确定嘛
That sounds a little vague.

321
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:51,404
是啊 因为这些都不是真的
Well, that's because none of it's true.

322
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,212
他的真名叫Aguistin Katt

加入了法国外籍兵团
when he was just 17 years old,

326
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,415
军衔升的很快
rose quickly through the ranks,

327
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,138
然后突然消失了八年
and then abruptly disappeared for eight years

328
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,046
后来以一个新身份重新出现

329
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,720
为侍卫军效力

330
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,427
侍卫军是什么
What's the Verrat?

331
00:18:10,927 --> 00:18:13,581
侍卫军是在1945年由皇室家族创立的
The Verrat was created by the royal families in 1945

332
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,732
一支防卫中队
as a protective squadron,

333
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,138
成员由格林生物组成 大多是猎狗

在二战中曾为双方效力

335
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,633
那个炸弹的目标是你吗
Was that bomb meant for you?

336
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,291
我或者我要去见的那个人
For me or the man I was meeting with.

337
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:23,147
可能是冲着我们俩
Probably both.

338
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:26,767
好吧 你想让我们怎么进行这次的调查
All right, how do you want us to deal with this investigation?

339
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:27,522
以静制动
We don't.

340
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,430
我们将计就计 至少现在是这样
We let the lie be the truth, at least for the time being.

341
00:18:30,772 --> 00:18:31,968
那你为什么告诉我们这些东西
Why are you telling us all this?

342
00:18:32,116 --> 00:18:34,230
如果他们想继续玩下去的话
Well, because if they're willing to go to these lengths,

343
00:18:34,352 --> 00:18:35,599
我们都得有所戒备
we all need to be on guard.

344
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:36,552
总比不知道的好
Good to know.

345
00:18:37,224 --> 00:18:37,749
小心
Be careful.

346
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:42,144
- 你相信他吗  - 嗯
- You believe him? - Yeah.

347
00:18:44,063 --> 00:18:44,699
你信任他吗
You trust him?

348
00:18:45,408 --> 00:18:46,092
不知道
I don't know.

349
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,150
是我
Yeah?

350
00:18:51,457 --> 00:18:53,620
- 嗨 你忙吗  - 怎么了
- Hey, are you busy? - Why?

351
00:18:54,365 --> 00:18:56,709
你最好来一趟第六大街的法院
I think you need to get down to the courthouse on sixth.

352
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,116
发生什么事了
And what's the problem?

353
00:18:58,147 --> 00:18:59,820
呃 没什么大事 只是一些无理取闹的证人
Oh, nothing much, just some rampant witness

354
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,351
- 还有干预陪审团  - 好的
- and jury tampering. - Okay.

355
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,575
嘿 感谢你们这么快就赶来
Hey. Thanks for getting down here so fast.

356
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,058
这里都快乱套了
It is going off the rails in there.

357
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:11,170
你们听说过Barry Kellogg 那个律师
You heard of Barry Kellogg, the lawyer?

358
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,520
他挺有名的 他正接手Nidaria的案子
He's pretty famous, handling the Nidaria case.

359
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,443
哦 是他在处理那件案子
Oh, he's handling it, all right.

360
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:16,840
他像个夜总会催眠师一样操纵着法庭
He's running the courtroom like a nightclub hypnotist.

361
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,221
你刚才说是关于操纵陪审团的事
You said something about jury tampering.

362
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,230
你有证据吗
You got proof?

363
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,385
呃 他不小心掉了一只蛤蟆
Well... He dropped a toad...

364
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,438
在男厕所里掉的
In the men's room.

365
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:25,562
神马
Excuse me?

366
00:19:27,138 --> 00:19:28,232
我觉得他是个山羊怪
I think he's a ziegevolk.

367
00:19:28,352 --> 00:19:30,192
否则还有谁会在厕所里吃蛤蟆
I mean, why else would he have a toad in the bathroom?

368
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,470
他到底在说啥
What the hell is he talking about?

369
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,984
山羊怪吃蛤蟆
A ziegevolk eats toads,

370
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:39,787
以使他们能对其它人进行神经致幻式的影响
which gives them a kind of psycho-hallucinogenic influence over people.

371
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:42,537
还记得那个在地下室囚禁女人的家伙吗
Remember that guy who caged women in his basement?

372
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,790
- 他也是山羊怪  - 是
- He was one? - Yeah.

373
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,649
不过这位不仅引诱女人
Except this guy's not just picking up women.

374
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,040
他操纵了整个陪审团
He's picking up an entire jury.

375
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:48,511
那你为什么在这儿
So why are you here?

376
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,160
因为Rosalee也在陪审团中
Because Rosalee is on the jury.

377
00:19:50,944 --> 00:19:51,564
我只是想说
I'm just saying.

378
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,507
你们进去看看
Take a look at this deal,

379
00:19:53,544 --> 00:19:54,660
就知道我说的真假了
and you tell me I'm crazy.

380
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,923
现在 根据你之前的证词
Now, according to your earlier testimony,

381
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,960
你在晚上8点15分左右
you arrived at the Nidaria residence

382
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:02,443
抵达了Nidaria的住所
at around 8:15 P.M.

383
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,018
你能描述一下 在你进入房子的时候
Can you please describe the defendant

384
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:07,280
被告人在做什么吗
when you entered the house?

385
00:20:07,593 --> 00:20:08,393
好的
Yes.

386
00:20:08,898 --> 00:20:10,790
我发现他在客厅 走来走去
I found him in his living room, pacing.

387
00:20:11,495 --> 00:20:12,461
吴也被牵涉进这个案子
Wu's on this case?

388
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,993
是的 他是第一个到达案发现场的
Yeah, he was first at the scene.

389
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:17,200
吴碰到这种事的次数都快数不过来了 没有律师能够收买他
Wu's done this a million times. No lawyer's gonna trick him.

390
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:18,550
好吧
Okay.

391
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:20,276
他说什么了吗
Did he say anything?

392
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,507
没有
No.

393
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,972
Nidaria先生 我要问你几个问题
Mr. Nidaria, I need to ask you a few questions.

394
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,609
Nidaria先生
Mr. Nidaria.

395
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,006
他拒绝回答任何问题
He refused to say anything.

396
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:35,138
只说 他已经叫律师过来了
Except that he'd already called his lawyer.

397
00:20:36,473 --> 00:20:39,261
被告对他妻子的遭遇
Did the defendant express any remorse

398
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,547
表示过任何同情吗
about what happened to his wife?

399
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,836
不 没有 至少在我面前是没有的
No. No, not to me.

400
00:20:44,627 --> 00:20:45,446
警官 谢谢你的配合
Thank you, officer.

401
00:20:48,356 --> 00:20:49,175
你可以发问了
Your witness.

402
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,320
警官 请允许我
Let me just say, sergeant, that...

403
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,916
表达对你们警局辛勤工作的感激
...we appreciate the hard work of the police department.

404
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,769
我们非常理解 每次在面对罪案
We understand the pressure you're under

405
00:20:58,787 --> 00:21:00,590
发生时你们的压力非常大
every time you face a crime scene.

406
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,538
经常要面对死亡 这并不是件容易的事
It's not easy facing death on a regular basis.

407
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:06,326
你作证说 我的委托人
You testified that my client

408
00:21:06,738 --> 00:21:09,003
并没有表现出任何同情
failed to express remorse...

409
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:12,209
这在我听来
Which sounds to me

410
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,436
好像是 一个每天都要面对死亡的警官
like the description a police officer would've had,

411
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,981
所做的麻木表述
one who experiences death on a daily basis.

412
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:21,593
我希望你能再重新回顾一下案发当夜
I want you to go back to that night one more time.

413
00:21:22,535 --> 00:21:25,015
我的委托人为他妻子的死而悲痛欲绝
My client was devastated by her death.

414
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,473
事实上 当你看到我的委托人时
My client was, in fact,

415
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:30,203
他在悲伤地流泪
in tears when you saw him.

416
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,495
反对
Objection.

417
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:33,778
又在主观引导证人
Leading the witness.

418
00:21:34,184 --> 00:21:35,021
反对无效
Sustained.

419
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:41,126
那请你自己描述一下
Then I'll let you tell it in your own words.

420
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,753
警官 当夜 你究竟看到了什么
What did you see, sergeant?

421
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,670
Nidaria先生 我要问你几个问题
Mr. Nidaria, I need to ask you a few questions.

422
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,667
我试图阻止她
I tried to stop her.

423
00:21:52,215 --> 00:21:54,086
上帝啊 这不是真的
God, this can't be happening.

424
00:21:55,926 --> 00:21:57,003
呃
Uh, well...

425
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:01,243
当我刚发现被告的时候 他在 呃
When I first saw the defendant, he was, uh...

426
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:06,153
警官 慢慢想
take your time, sergeant.

427
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,080
这非常重要
This is very important.

428
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,726
呃
Uh...

429
00:22:15,846 --> 00:22:17,181
好吧 我想 他是在
Yeah, I think he was...

430
00:22:19,483 --> 00:22:20,190
哭泣
Crying.

431
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:22,024
是的 在流眼泪
Crying.

432
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:24,664
我可以理解成 他悲痛欲绝吗
Would you say he was distraught?

433
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:35,446
是的 可以
Yes.

434
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,372
警官 非常感谢你的证词
Thank you, sergeant.

435
00:22:38,307 --> 00:22:39,101
这究竟怎么回事
What the hell?

436
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,504
尊敬的法官 我问完了
No further questions, your honor.

437
00:22:41,396 --> 00:22:42,055
我都告诉你了
I'm telling you.

438
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:43,987
就是癞蛤蟆在作祟
It's the toad.

439
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,403
好吧 伙伴们
Okay guys...

440
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:56,664
发生什么事了
What's going on?

441
00:22:59,138 --> 00:23:00,855
所以Barry kellogg是山羊怪
So Barry Kellogg is a ziegevolk?

442
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,123
这就是他操纵别人的真相
That's how he wins.

443
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,581
我还是不能相信 吴竟然
I still can't believe he got Wu

444
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,830
在他的操纵下 修改了证词
to reverse his testimony.

445
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,578
他服用的是非常珍惜品种的癞蛤蟆
He's using some kind of rare type toad

446
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,187
能够极大程度上的提升山羊怪的费洛蒙
to really supercharge the ziegevolk pheromones.

447
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,203
他一直在蛊惑我们
He's been drugging us.

448
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,104
他玩弄了整个法庭
He's got the whole courtroom bamboozled.

449
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:12,867
这如此明显
It's so obvious.

450
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,430
我不敢相信 一开始我竟然没看出来
I can't believe I didn't see it from the beginning.

451
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,809
既然我们看清了对手
Now that we know what we're dealing with,

452
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,292
有没有什么
isn't there some sort of...

453
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,052
防护罩之类的
Immunity nasal spray you can make

454
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,480
可以不让Kellogg操纵你
to keep Kellogg from influencing you?

455
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:21,323
或许吧
Maybe.

456
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,569
只让Rosalee不被他影响是不够的
Just getting it into Rosalee isn't gonna do any good.

457
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,520
我们需要整个陪审团都认为他有罪
We'd need the whole jury to vote guilty.

458
00:23:25,723 --> 00:23:27,341
能不能证明他有什么行为不当之处
Could you prove some sort of malpractice?

459
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,673
怎么证明 吃癞蛤蟆又不犯法
How? Eating frogs isn't illegal.

460
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,615
也不要试图证明
And forget trying to prove

461
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,490
他们有超能力 能影响整个陪审团
they have magical powers to influence a jury.

462
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,578
而且 这个人能让各种杀人犯逍遥法外
And besides, this guy puts killers back on the streets.

463
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:35,938
只赢这一个案子是扳不倒他的
Tanking one case isn't enough.

464
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,147
我们要想法阻止他 一劳永逸
We need to figure out a way to stop him for good.

465
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:40,763
我们没有多少时间了 明天就要结案了
We don't have much time. Closing arguments are tomorrow.

466
00:24:47,218 --> 00:24:48,978
这儿提到了一些用火蜥蜴
Here's something about pheromone production

467
00:24:48,996 --> 00:24:49,932
催生出费洛蒙
using salamanders.

468
00:24:50,283 --> 00:24:51,470
不行 一定要是癞蛤蟆
No. Gotta be toads.

469
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,763
这儿有一些论述
This one has a lengthy treatise

470
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,301
是关于山羊怪的骨骼分析神马的
on ziegevolk anatomy, but...

471
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,646
不过看起来这个作者对
The author seems mostly interested

472
00:24:56,676 --> 00:24:59,655
重组三个还是四个胃这种辩论更感兴趣
in rehashing the old "Three versus four stomachs" Debate.

473
00:25:00,363 --> 00:25:01,483
- 这也值得辩论  - 是的
- That's a debate? - Oh, yeah.

474
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,433
等一下 这有一些关于山羊怪大脑的描述
Wait, there's something here in the ziegevolk's brain.

475
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,609
Geruck腺就在下丘脑下方
The geruck gland, which is below the hypothalamus,

476
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,052
对于山羊怪来说是非常独特的构造
is unique to the ziegevolk and is devoted solely

477
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,972
通过汗腺 专门控制
to regulating the release of pheromones

478
00:25:11,101 --> 00:25:12,209
费洛蒙的释放
through the sweat glands.

479
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,440
这就是为什么他们能如此有效地利用自己的费洛蒙
That's how they utilize their pheromones so effectively.

480
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,073
- 关于癞蛤蟆怎么说的  - 什么都没有
- What does it say about toads? - Nothing here.

481
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,064
不过这很好理解了
But it's pretty obvious

482
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,615
当他们吃某种两栖动物时
that when they eat certain amphibians,

483
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,587
腺体受到强烈刺激
it super-stimulates this gland and sends the production

484
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,483
能够释放并加强费洛蒙的功效
and strength of the pheromone into overdrive,

485
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:27,170
所以 这就是我们的目标
so... so this is our target.

486
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:28,363
那我们要从哪儿下手呢
And how do we get to it?

487
00:25:29,058 --> 00:25:31,193
我们要找到一种东西 可以中和腺体
We make a solution that neutralizes that gland,

488
00:25:31,273 --> 00:25:33,010
这样就能阻止他释放费洛蒙
which will stop him from producing pheromones

489
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,676
吃多少癞蛤蟆也没有用
no matter how many toads he eats.

490
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,424
类似于费洛蒙腺体阉割吧
Sort of a pheromone vasec to me,

491
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,369
无论他对陪审团说什么 都没有用了 
which will negate everything he's told the jury.

492
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:41,015
- 我们行动吧  - 没问题
- Well, let's do it. - Okay.

493
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,286
哦 天哪 不
Oh, no. Oh, no.

494
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,410
我们还需要一种非常难得到的材料
There's one unfortunate ingredient we need.

495
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:46,756
早就知道没那么简单了
Should've seen that coming.

496
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:49,126
- 是什么  - Barry kellogg的汗水
- What is it? - Barry Kellogg's sweat.

497
00:25:54,652 --> 00:25:55,673
这尼玛我们怎么得到
How the hell do we get that?

498
00:25:56,996 --> 00:25:57,944
首先 我们要找到他
First, we find him.

499
00:25:59,206 --> 00:26:00,369
然后 我们让他流汗
And then we make him sweat.

500
00:26:32,098 --> 00:26:34,307
我不知道 我就这么和你走了对不对
I'm not sure I should really leave with you.

501
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,913
选择权在你
It's up to you.

502
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:38,750
我几乎一点都不了解你
I hardly know you.

503
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:41,735
但是和我在一起 你很有安全感
But you feel safe and secure with me,

504
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,406
你想和我去我家
and you wanna come back to my room.

505
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:48,166
知道吗 这正是我所想的
You know what, I think I do.

506
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,861
我以前从来没做过这样的事
I've never done this before.

507
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,360
完全同意
I won't hold that against you.

508
00:26:59,883 --> 00:27:00,720
那是什么
What was that?

509
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,301
警察
Police!

510
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,415
小姐 你还好吗
You okay, miss?

511
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:17,780
刚才有东西就那么跳到我们面前 我不知道那究竟是什么
Something just jumped out at us. I don't know what it was.

512
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,624
- 像杀人狂魔一样  - 我打电话回局里
- Some kind of maniac. - I'll call it in.

513
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,987
- 好吧 你叫什么名字  - Olivia Sutton
- All right, what's your name? - Olivia Sutton.

514
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,501
Sutton小姐 你为什么不回酒吧呆会儿呢
Why don't you get back in the bar, Ms. Sutton,

515
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,203
不要在街上逗留
get off the street?

516
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,753
- 救命  - 嗨
- Help! - Hey!

517
00:27:33,876 --> 00:27:35,304
来人啊 救命
Help! Help!

518
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,046
救命啊
Help! Help!

519
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,307
- 怎么了  - 狼人
- What's wrong? - Blutbad!

520
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:42,873
快上车
Get in the truck!

521
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:47,156
快走 走啊 快走
Go, go! Come on, come on!

522
00:28:06,504 --> 00:28:07,292
怎么样了
How'd it go?

523
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:08,516
嗯 他果然流汗了
Oh, he's sweating.

524
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,455
但是我感觉我的腹股沟拉伤了
But I think I pulled a groin muscle.

525
00:28:13,969 --> 00:28:14,861
他就这么凭空出现了
He just came outta nowhere!

526
00:28:14,972 --> 00:28:16,190
是的 我看到了
Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

527
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,436
你出了好多汗
Here, you built up quite a sweat.

528
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,766
哦 谢谢你 亲爱的朋友
Oh, thank you, my friend.

529
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,883
你真是救了我一命
You quite literally saved my life.

530
00:28:21,956 --> 00:28:23,341
嗯 算不上什么
Ah, it's... it's really nothing.

531
00:28:23,673 --> 00:28:24,707
- 我们就是这样的  - 是啊
- That's what wesen are for. - Yeah.

532
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,744
互相帮助
Helping each other, you know,

533
00:28:27,218 --> 00:28:28,098
离别的格林生物远一点
get away from other wesen.

534
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,420
让我请你喝一杯 这是我该做的
Let me buy you a drink, it's the least I can do.

535
00:28:40,578 --> 00:28:42,178
我要回家了 妻子最大 你懂的
I gotta get home. The wife and all, you know.

536
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:43,883
非常感谢你
Thank you so much.

537
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,070
- 没什么  - 真的很感谢
- Yeah. Sure. - Really.

538
00:28:47,963 --> 00:28:49,655
呃 我的 手帕
Oh, uh, my, uh... my handkerchief?

539
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,664
呃 是的
Yeah.

540
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,258
都脏了 让我再给你买些新的吧 印名字的那种
This thing's a mess. Let me buy you a dozen more. Monogrammed.

541
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:55,110
不 不用 我就要那条
No, no, I need that one!

542
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,760
我的意思是 那是妻子
I mean, uh, my wife gave it to me

543
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:02,387
去年圣诞 送给我的生日礼物
as a birthday present last Christmas.

544
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,436
我的生日在圣诞节
My birthday's on Christmas.

545
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:06,633
就像耶稣也是圣诞过生日一样 谢谢
Like Jesus. Thanks.

546
00:29:18,627 --> 00:29:19,335
我拿到了
I got it!

547
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,350
拿到了 他想要回去
I got it. He wanted to take it back.

548
00:29:22,547 --> 00:29:23,040
但是我搞定了
But I got it.

549
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,301
好了 快点 我们把这个放进药罐里
Okay, hurry. Let's put it in the pot.

550
00:29:28,455 --> 00:29:29,095
好了
Okay.

551
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,643
这还需要浸泡几个小时
This needs to steep for a few hours.

552
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,870
所以 我们已经拿到了他的汗液
So we leach out all his sweat.

553
00:29:37,913 --> 00:29:39,963
然后 把还原剂加到药水里
Then, we add the reduction to the rest of the potion.

554
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:43,175
- 这就到了最难的部分了  - 什么
- Then comes the hard part. - Hard part?

555
00:29:43,507 --> 00:29:44,572
我们不是刚刚把最难的部分完成了吗
Didn't we just do the hard part?

556
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,233
刚刚做的一切是帮我们制作解药
All this does is help us make the antidote.

557
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:48,560
但是我们要在Kellogg吃癞蛤蟆前把它加进去
Which we have to get into Kellogg's toad before he eats it.

558
00:29:48,676 --> 00:29:50,338
这样 解药才会直接进入他的Geruck腺
That way, it'll go straight to his geruck gland.

559
00:29:50,738 --> 00:29:53,175
哦 好吧 我懂了 很合理
Uh, okay. I guess that makes sense.

560
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,089
但我们怎么把它加进去呢
But how do we get it into his toad?

561
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:07,286
- Kellogg先生  - 是的
- Mr. Kellogg. - Yes?

562
00:30:07,895 --> 00:30:10,061
我是Burkhardt警探 这是Griffin警探
I'm Detective Burkhardt. This is Detective Griffin.

563
00:30:10,363 --> 00:30:11,083
我们能进去吗
May we come in?

564
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,855
- 出什么事了  - 我们接到
- What's this all about? - We're just following up

565
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,796
Olivia Sutton小姐的报警电话
on the 911 call made by Olivia Sutton.

566
00:30:16,018 --> 00:30:18,104
他说 昨晚遇袭的时候是和你在一起
She said she was with you when you were attacked last night.

567
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,298
- 几分钟时间就够了  - 好吧 不过请快点
- It'll just take a few minutes. - All right, but make it quick.

568
00:30:21,323 --> 00:30:22,726
我有个案子45分钟后就开庭了
I'm due in court in 45 minutes.

569
00:30:31,273 --> 00:30:33,489
我们只做了一剂量的药水
We have just enough for one dose.

570
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,827
确保你把它都注射进癞蛤蟆里
Make sure you inject all of it into the toad.

571
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,590
- 好吧  - 或许我该来做这件事
- Okay. - Maybe I should do it?

572
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,387
不 不行 你现在该去法庭了
No, no. You can't. You have to be in court.

573
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,510
而且 如果他看见你 会认出来的
Besides, if he sees you, he'll recognize you.

574
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,350
我来搞定
I got it.

575
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,473
没问题
I'm good.

576
00:30:53,581 --> 00:30:55,366
你能描述一下袭击者的长相吗
Could you describe the man who attacked you?

577
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:58,344
其实 也算不上是袭击
Well, it wasn't exactly an attack.

578
00:30:58,412 --> 00:30:59,889
我可能也有点反应过度了
I may have overreacted.

579
00:31:00,855 --> 00:31:02,892
那位年轻的小姐没有受伤 还是让我很欣慰的
I'm just relieved the young lady was not injured.

580
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,335
呃 那位小姐说你逃跑了
Uh, the woman said you ran away

581
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,873
- 他追着你  - 当然
- and he ran after you. - Of course.

582
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,356
我试图从她身边把他引开
I was trying to lead him away from her.

583
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:11,140
所以你为了她的安全着想才跑开的
So you ran away in concern for her safety.

584
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,095
当然 你不会这么做吗
Absolutely. Wouldn't you?

585
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,852
她说袭击者看上去很奇怪
Now, she said to you he looked strange,

586
00:31:15,895 --> 00:31:17,780
好像他的脸和别人有些不一样
like there was something wrong with his face.

587
00:31:17,963 --> 00:31:20,553
额 他穿着个帽衫 我看不清他的脸
Eh, he was wearing a hoodie. I didn't get a good look.

588
00:31:20,941 --> 00:31:23,010
- 帽衫是什么颜色的  - 我不太记得了
- What color hoodie?  - I'm not sure.

589
00:31:23,273 --> 00:31:25,870
- 我真的要  - 还有几个问题
- Look, I really have to...  - just a few more questions.

590
00:31:34,147 --> 00:31:35,040
两只蛤蟆
Two toads?

591
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,203
两只蛤蟆 一剂解药
Two toads... One dose.

592
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,378
坑爹的吧
Seriously?

593
00:31:50,424 --> 00:31:51,692
好吧 Kellogg先生
Now, Mr. Kellogg,

594
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,689
你是如何躲过这次袭击的
how did you get away from the attacker?

595
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,252
我看见一个工人正在装货
I saw a workman loading his truck.

596
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:00,400
如果没有他 我可能逃不过此劫
If it wasn't for him, I probably wouldn't have gotten away.

597
00:32:00,621 --> 00:32:02,060
那个工人看到袭击者吗
Did he see the man who was chasing you?

598
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,987
- 是的  - 你知道他是谁吗
- Yes. - Do you know his name?

599
00:32:04,596 --> 00:32:05,193
不知道
No.

600
00:32:06,135 --> 00:32:07,101
工人把你载到什么地方
Where did he drive you?

601
00:32:07,766 --> 00:32:08,953
回到这里酒店
Back here to the hotel.

602
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,338
把我载到什么地方你们也要知道吗
What does it matter where he drove me?

603
00:32:10,504 --> 00:32:11,280
千万别动
Don't move.

604
00:32:11,606 --> 00:32:12,960
我们只是想找到一个可以
We're trying to identify the man

605
00:32:13,003 --> 00:32:14,443
辨认袭击者的证人
who can identify the man who chased you.

606
00:32:15,624 --> 00:32:17,624
- 你刚才说那个工人看到袭击者了  - 他是看见了
- You said he saw him. - He did.

607
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:20,966
哎呀 不要
Oh, no.

608
00:32:21,027 --> 00:32:22,646
再见面 你还能认出他吗
Would you recognize him if you saw him again?

609
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:26,010
你是说袭击者吗
The man who was chasing me?

610
00:32:26,295 --> 00:32:27,944
不是 那个载你到这的人
No, the man who drove you here.

611
00:32:31,236 --> 00:32:33,587
我不知道 可能吧 我不知道他是谁
I don't know, maybe. I don't know who he is.

612
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,876
- 那个袭击者  - 不是 那个帮我的工人
- The man who was chasing you. - No, the other man!

613
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,720
你知道的 我是辩护律师
Look, I'm a defense attorney.

614
00:32:43,747 --> 00:32:46,947
不凑巧 我现在正在处理一个非常重要的案件
I happen to be involved in a very important case right now.

615
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,640
警察先生 我必须走了
Gentlemen, I have to go.

616
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,055
- 等一下 先生 等一下  - Kellogg先生
- No, sir, no! Nope. - Mr. Kellogg.

617
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,560
袭击你的人还在外面晃荡呢
There's a very dangerous man out there.

618
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,095
不要碰我
You're touching me.

619
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,046
我必须尽我们所能
We need to do everything in our power

620
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,344
抓到袭击者
to get him off the streets.

621
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,280
在你遇袭的街区我们已经接到很多投诉了
Now, we've heard other complaints in the same area.

622
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,920
这些袭击和你描述的很相似
Attacks just like the one you've described.

623
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,615
如果同样的袭击者再次犯案攻击了其他人
How would you feel if the same man

624
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,556
你会作何感想
attacked someone else?

625
00:33:11,513 --> 00:33:13,460
我知道的是 你们在我住的酒店里
All I know is you're not gonna catch him

626
00:33:13,489 --> 00:33:14,480
是抓不到犯人的
in my hotel room.

627
00:33:15,224 --> 00:33:19,138
我要出庭了 我要走了
Now, I am due in court, and I am leaving...

628
00:33:19,987 --> 00:33:22,067
除非你们能对法官解释
Unless you would like to explain to the judge

629
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,307
为什么我不能到法庭做结案陈词
why I'm not there for closing arguments.

630
00:33:26,424 --> 00:33:27,304
我想我们问得差不多了
I think we're good here.

631
00:33:28,301 --> 00:33:29,366
谢谢你的合作 先生
Thank you for your time, sir.

632
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,600
你们在这呢
There you are!

633
00:33:41,704 --> 00:33:42,849
我们遇到麻烦了
We got a problem.

634
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:45,230
- 什么麻烦  - 他有两个蛤蟆
- What? - He had two toads.

635
00:33:45,907 --> 00:33:48,061
- 两个蛤蟆  - 我不知道他会用哪个做午餐
- Two toads? - I don't know which one he's gonna choose

636
00:33:48,412 --> 00:33:49,298
那你怎么办的
What did you do?

637
00:33:49,378 --> 00:33:51,046
我能怎么做 只选一只啊
The only thing I could do. I picked one.

638
00:33:54,695 --> 00:33:56,258
陪审团的各位先生们女士们
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

639
00:33:57,288 --> 00:33:59,377
我的家乡有句俗语
we have a saying back where I'm from.

640
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,944
"人不可貌相 海水不可斗量"
"Never judge a heifer by its hide."

641
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,369
当我站在此处 
I'm reminded of these words as I stand here

642
00:34:08,393 --> 00:34:11,370
恳请各位审判我的当事人时
asking you to judge my client

643
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,083
我再次想起了这句话
as you would a heifer.

644
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,926
不要只看表面 要看到本质
Not by its hide, but by its character.

645
00:34:19,113 --> 00:34:22,326
Don爱Katherine胜过爱自己的生命
Don loved Katherine more than life itself.

646
00:34:24,406 --> 00:34:27,330
他们一起渡过了五个多月的
They lived together in wedded bliss

647
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,292
幸福婚姻时光
for more than five months.

648
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,526
他为她不惜做任何事情
He would've done anything for her.

649
00:34:33,243 --> 00:34:35,187
任何事情 但绝不会伤害她
Anything but kill her.

650
00:34:36,123 --> 00:34:38,012
他的女仆
You heard testimony from his maid,

651
00:34:38,258 --> 00:34:40,092
司机 厨子
chauffeur, cook,

652
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:41,600
甚至警察
even the police.

653
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,704
都证实了这一事实
And they all tell the same story.

654
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:47,880
一个默默无闻
The story of a quiet,

655
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,698
正直高尚 遵纪守法的公民
upstanding, law-abiding citizen

656
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,378
被我们所谓英明的司法系统
caught in the clutches of a uncaring judicial system

657
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:58,603
无辜地指控了
intent upon prosecuting an innocent man.

658
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:04,953
亲爱的朋友们  这个人的命运掌握在你们手中
My friends, the fate of this man is in your hands.

659
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,178
公正与否 取决于你们的决定
It's up to you to see that justice is done.

660
00:35:30,092 --> 00:35:30,867
谢谢
Thank you.

661
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,710
阁下 Schade小姐
Mein herr, Fraulein Schade.

662
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,258
Eric 欢迎回来
Eric, welcome back.

663
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,695
你看起真是棒极了
You look fabulous.

664
00:35:39,175 --> 00:35:39,975
你也是
So do you.

665
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:44,050
最好带回了那把钥匙
Which brings us to the key.

666
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:47,058
我没有那把钥匙
I don't have it.

667
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,221
噢 真是太令人失望了
Well, that's disappointing.

668
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,886
我猜你告诉我弟弟
I assume you told my brother

669
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,541
如果你没有拿到钥匙会发生什么
what would happen if you didn't produce it.

670
00:35:59,396 --> 00:36:02,190
我说过如果他不交出钥匙 你会向那个格林和盘托出所有的事情
I told him you would tell the Grimm everything if he didn't.

671
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:03,643
我好奇他在耍什么把戏呢
I wonder what game he's playing.

672
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,163
他说他没有办法拿到钥匙
He said he couldn't get the key.

673
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:09,846
至少 在你给他的这么短时间内他拿不到
At least, not in the short amount of time that you gave him.

674
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,030
我不认为时间是个问题
I don't believe time was the issue.

675
00:36:16,055 --> 00:36:17,446
动机才是问题
It's the motivation.

676
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,129
我不敢说我能完全理解
I can't say I completely understand

677
00:36:20,147 --> 00:36:22,018
你弟弟的动机是什么
what motivates your brother.

678
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,990
他比其他人都要难以捉摸
He's more complicated than most men.

679
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,812
带点儿女巫血统他就为所欲为了
A little bit of hexenbiest goes a long way.

680
00:36:34,787 --> 00:36:35,630
那个格林迟早都会
I suppose it's about time the

681
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,606
知道我们兄弟间的事情
Grimm knew the truth about my brother and me.

682
00:36:37,766 --> 00:36:38,763
你要我告诉他吗
Do you want me to tell him?

683
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,873
嗯 不
Mm, no.

684
00:36:42,221 --> 00:36:44,215
我已经有很长一段时间没见到我弟弟了
It's been a long time since I've seen my brother.

685
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,138
我很想给他一个拥抱
I'm looking forward to wrapping my arms around him.

686
00:36:53,298 --> 00:36:53,969
怎么了
What?

687
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:56,760
你有些变化
What's different about you?

688
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,396
没有啊 为什么这样说
Nothing. Why?

689
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,643
我不知道 你有些
I don't know. You have this...

690
00:37:05,261 --> 00:37:06,301
光彩夺目
Glow.

691
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,129
那是因为和你在一起
That's 'cause I'm with you.

692
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,113
- 你说这个要多长时间  - 很难说
- How long you think this will take? - It's hard to say.

哥一定要你说个时间 要多久呢
Well, if you had to say, how long would it take?

694
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:27,046
如果他们有罪 时间可能长点
If they're guilty, it could take forever.

695
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,280
如果他们无罪 通常都非常快

- 这很快啊  - 一直都是

709
00:38:28,713 --> 00:38:31,304
陪审团认为罪名
we find the defendant Donald Nidaria

710
00:38:32,203 --> 00:38:32,836
成立

我想要谢谢大家

如果没有你们的努力
If it wasn't for what you did,

716

我可能就让凶手逍遥法外了
I'd be part of setting a killer free.

717
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,043
然后我们救了几条人命 Nidaria进了监狱
And we saved some lives. Nidaria's in jail.

718
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,664
Kellogg也没办法再在陪审团面前
And Kellogg will never be able to step in front of a jury again

719

施展他的魔力了
without antagonizing them.

720
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,498
我现在都无法相信 我真真实实地偷了一个人的汗液
I still can't believe I actually stole a guy's sweat.

有人告诉我这个地方可以帮我
I was told this is the place I should come.
