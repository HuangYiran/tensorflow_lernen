1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:02,458
混沌初世，一片黑暗
Male narrator: In the beginning, there was darkness.

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:03,875
接着...爆炸
And then... Bang.

3
00:00:04,777 --> 00:00:09,152
产生了无边无际的时间、空间和物质
Giving birth to an endless expanding
existence of time, space and matter.

4
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:13,416
有一个地方，每天都有新发现
Every day, new discoveries are unlocking the mysterious,

5
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:16,555
但它依然极端神秘，让人饶有兴趣
the mind-blowing, the deadly secrets of a place

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,680
它就是宇宙
we call the universe.

7
00:00:20,513 --> 00:00:23,319
在这个广袤的太空
Between stars, between galaxies,

8
00:00:23,499 --> 00:00:25,527
大多数星体和星系
in the vast majority of space,

9
00:00:25,972 --> 00:00:30,583
其温度远低于零下450度
the temperature reads more than 450 degrees below zero.

10
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:34,666
极度严寒的太空甚至让我们呼吸的空气
The deep freeze of space would turn even the air you breathe

11
00:00:34,694 --> 00:00:36,541
变为坚冰
into nothing more than solid ice.

12
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:39,791
遥远的冰冻世界
Narrator: Now far off frozen places

13
00:00:39,985 --> 00:00:42,027
带来了奇异的新奥秘
bring strange new mysteries.

14
00:00:42,638 --> 00:00:47,233
布莫让星云也叫领结星云，比太空环境寒冷得多
The Boomerang or Bow Tie nebula is actually colder than the surrounding space.

15
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:50,693
冰冻世界里有生命吗？
Narrator: Is there life on frozen worlds?

16
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:53,301
而且，极端低温为什么会导致
And why does the ultimate cold

17
00:00:53,328 --> 00:00:55,368
超乎我们认识的物理现象？
change physics as we know it?

18
00:00:55,895 --> 00:00:59,720
我们能让光变慢到自行车那样的速度
We can take light and slow it down to the speed of a bicycle.

19
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:05,388
让我们一起去寻找宇宙里最低温的地方
Narrator: Join us as we travel in search of the lowest，temperatures in the universe,

20
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,347
那个极端严寒的世界吧
and the ultimate deep freeze.

《宇宙：深度冻结》

23
00:01:22,907 --> 00:01:25,832
要深刻理解宇宙最低温的地方
To appreciate the coldest places in our universe,

24
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:28,237
就得了解
it's important to remember

25
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,615
它们以前炽热到什么程度
just how hot all of existence once was.

27
00:01:37,637 --> 00:01:40,970
大爆炸剧烈爆发离子和能量
We think of the Big Bang as the ultimate hot event--

28
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:44,637
是一个极度高温的过程
An excitement of plasma and energy.

29
00:01:45,998 --> 00:01:48,248
在宇宙还处在高温的时候
When the universe was really hot,

30
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:50,040
它并没有真正成形
it was really without form.

31
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:53,026
放射物和粒子在高速运动
There was just radiation and particles all zooming around,

32
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:54,831
相互转变
turning into each other.

33
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:00,664
大爆炸过程极其高温
The Big Bang was a supremely hot event,

34
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:04,456
大约是一亿兆兆度的开氏温度
roughly a hundred million trillion trillion Kelvins.

35
00:02:07,553 --> 00:02:10,828
科学家们所说的开氏温度
Narrator: Scientists measure temperature using the Kelvin scale,

36
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:13,373
其基准是绝对零度
which begins at absolute zero

37
00:02:13,595 --> 00:02:15,956
那是已知的最低温度
-- The coldest cold we know

38
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,456
原子运动此时完全不存在
-- A complete lack of atomic movement.

39
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:26,372
在地球上...平均温度是开氏288度
On Earth... the average temperature is 288 Kelvins...

40
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:30,483
即华氏59度...
Or 59 degrees Fahrenheit...

41
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:35,025
两种表述虽然不同，但都是指同一温度
Two different ways of noting the same temperature.

42
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:37,705
宇宙形成之初
When our universe first formed,

43
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:41,136
温度很高，甚至原子都不能存在
it was so hot that not even atoms could exist.

44
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:44,289
整个宇宙除了单纯的能量，什么都没有
The entire universe was nothing except for pure energy.

45
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:48,302
在一百秒后
It took a hundred seconds for our universe

46
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,955
宇宙温度降到了十亿度
to cool to the point that it was only a billion degrees.

47
00:02:53,164 --> 00:02:55,247
在很长的时间里，温度仍然很高
For a long time, everything was so hot

48
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:58,302
一切都被分裂为亚原子微粒
that everything was divided into subatomic particles

49
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:01,455
不是现在传统的原子状态
-- Not real traditional atoms the way that we think of matter now.

50
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:05,552
当宇宙温度降至足够低
The universe had to cool down to a sufficiently low temperature

51
00:03:05,677 --> 00:03:08,372
首先是原子核得以形成
that, first of all,atomic nuclei could form,

52
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:10,524
然后中性原子形成
and then neutral atoms could form.

53
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:14,316
因此，如果不是宇宙温度降到足够低
So without the universe cooling
down to a sufficiently low temperature,

54
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:16,511
我们就不会存在
we wouldn't exist.

55
00:03:18,024 --> 00:03:23,163
宇宙温度继续下降，直到大爆炸后的56,000年
The universe kept cooling, until 56,000 years after the big bang

56
00:03:23,191 --> 00:03:25,816
它冷却至9,000度
it had cooled to 9,000 degrees.

57
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:32,260
在大爆炸380,000年后，则下降至
And the universe kept cooling, until 380,000 years after the Big Bang

58
00:03:32,677 --> 00:03:34,955
大约开氏3,000度
temperatures reached about 3,000 Kelvin.

59
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,510
这是一个拐点，物质与能量终于分开
And that was the point out which matter and energy finally parted company.

60
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,038
正是温度的下降，才让我们能够开始理解
Narrator: As temperatures dropped to a level we can start to comprehend

61
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:48,718
热量与温度之间的关系
-- It's important to understand the relationship between heat and temperature.

62
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:52,788
热量是能量转移的量度
Heat is a measurement of energy transfer.

63
00:03:53,913 --> 00:03:55,732
温度是作用力
Temperature is action.

64
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,218
让微粒持续碰撞
One of the easiest ways to think of temperature

65
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:01,760
是观察温度最简单的方法之一
is as the constant collision of particles.

66
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:04,385
你增加房间里气体的量
You increase the amount of gas in a room,

67
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:07,940
它们会开始碰撞--互相紧挨着...
they start colliding-- One particle against another...

68
00:04:08,676 --> 00:04:12,982
就象下午人流高峰期的东京街头
Like people in a busy crosswalk on a Tokyo rush-hour afternoon.

69
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:17,482
正如这些气体分子相互碰撞，温度会升高一样
As those gas molecules collide one with another, the temperature goes up.

70
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:20,482
在人碰人时
And as those people collide one with another,

71
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:24,315
速度被转移，人会趔趄
their velocities get transferred, people get bumped forward,

72
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:26,218
体温也会升高
their temperature goes up.

73
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:28,954
如果人少了
Now you start removing people--

74
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:31,426
碰撞会变得不频繁
Those collisions, they become less frequent.

75
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:35,468
神经变得不紧张，体温就会下降
Nerves become less frayed-- The temperature drops.

76
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:39,343
同样地，当你抽走房间里的气体
And in the same way, as you remove gas from a room,

77
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,120
碰撞变得不频繁，气体温度就会降下来
the collisions become less frequent, and it becomes cooler to experience.

78
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:52,953
人类在建设家园的时候
Narrator: As mankind has spread out over all the lands that make up our home in the universe,

79
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:57,287
领略到了极寒地区的独特魅力
areas of extreme cold hold a special fascination.

80
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,606
在地球上测到的最低温度
The coldest temperature ever measured on Earth

81
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,300
是在南极洲
was measured in Antarctica,

82
00:05:02,328 --> 00:05:05,898
它超过了零下125度
at over 125 degrees below zero.

83
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:09,842
这杯饮料里的干冰
Dry ice, like the ice in this drink,

84
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:13,161
大约是在零下109度时凝结的
freezes out at about 109 degrees below zero.

85
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:18,092
所以在南极洲，你能找到自然形成的干冰
So you could have naturally occurring dry ice in the conditions found in Antarctica,

86
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,661
因为那里非常冷
it's so cold.

87
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:24,953
在见识了我们星球最低温的地方后
Narrator: Having found the coldest place on our planet,

88
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,758
我们现在去探寻太阳系最低温的地方
we now journey to the coldest place in our Solar System.

89
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,814
出乎意料的是，我们并不需要去很远
And surprisingly, we don't have to go very far.

90
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:36,883
事实上，人类曾到过那里
In fact, it's a place where humans have already been.

91
00:05:37,564 --> 00:05:39,953
从已知情况来看，最冷的地方
From what we know today, the coldest place

92
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:41,925
出乎人们的预料
isn't exactly where you'd expect it.

93
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:44,966
月球轨道探测器
The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter

94
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:49,508
在阳光永远照不到的地方
has detected a temperature of minus 397 degrees fahrenheit

95
00:05:49,744 --> 00:05:53,119
发现其中一处只有华氏-397度
in one of those places where the sun's light never quite reaches.

96
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,147
它就位于月球一座环形山的底部
It's actually in the bottom of a crater of our Earth's own Moon.

97
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:03,910
当月球环绕地球时，它缓慢地自转
As the Moon goes around the Earth, it slowly rotates.

98
00:06:03,938 --> 00:06:08,508
实际上，每绕地球一次就恰好自转一周
In fact, it rotates exactly once per time around the planet,

99
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,244
所以我们总是看到月球的同一个面
allowing us to always see the same face of the Moon.

100
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:14,105
在环绕的时候
But as it goes around,

101
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,160
阳光永远不能从北极下落
sunlight is never able to reach down into the northern pole

102
00:06:18,174 --> 00:06:20,771
或是从南极升起
or reach up into the southern pole.

103
00:06:21,063 --> 00:06:25,035
两地的环形山会永恒地呆在阴影里
And craters in those two regions，are able to stay in constant shadow,

104
00:06:25,257 --> 00:06:29,466
因为阳光仅从其边缘一掠而过
because the sunlight simply glances past the edge of the crater,

105
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,813
永远都不会照射进去
but never actually shines inside.

106
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:37,854
科学家在月球上发现极度严寒的现象后
Narrator: Once scientists discovered the ultra-deep freeze on our own Moon,

107
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:40,771
他们意识到，另有一个地方
they realized there was another place

108
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:44,451
即使位于如火的行星，也会同样寒冷
that could be equally cold-- On a planet of fire.

109
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:48,243
就象月球的那些环形山
The realization that craters

110
00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:50,979
它们会保护冰远离阳光
like those on the Moon could protect ices from sunlight,

111
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,549
我们认识到
made us start to realize that

112
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:57,340
在任何地方的环形山，几乎都可能找到冰
it's possible to find ices in craters almost anywhere.

113
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,993
水星是最靠近太阳的行星
Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun.

114
00:07:00,312 --> 00:07:02,882
在向阳面，极为高温
And its sunlit side is incredibly hot

115
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,632
温度在零上数百度以上
-- Many hundred of degrees above absolute zero.

116
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,527
但水星的某些部分却是永恒地寒冷
But there's some parts of Mercury that are perpetually cold

117
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:12,145
几乎是太阳系最冷的地方
-- Among the coldest places in the Solar System.

118
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:17,562
水星的倾斜
Narrator: It's Mercury's tilt-- Or lack thereof--

119
00:07:17,632 --> 00:07:20,854
保持了两极上环形山的严寒
Which keeps its polar craters in a deep freeze.

120
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,479
行星的倾斜以倾斜度来衡量
The tilt of the planet is called its obliquity.

121
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:27,284
地球大约倾斜23.5度
Earth is tilted about 23 1/2 degrees.

122
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:31,145
所以我们的两极每年只有六个月见到阳光
So our poles see sunlight about six months out of the year.

123
00:07:31,312 --> 00:07:34,395
水星的倾斜度几乎为零
On Mercury the obliquity is almost zero.

124
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,590
极地上某些深邃的环形山
So at some deep craters at the poles,

125
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:40,103
会有永久阴影，终年不见阳光
there are spots that are permanently shadowed and never see sunlight.

126
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:45,992
虽然在太阳系里，离太阳越远就会越冷
Narrator: Although the Solar System gets colder the further you travel from the Sun,

127
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:49,366
但外层行星和它们卫星的寒冷
the icy conditions of the outer planets and moons

128
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:52,395
并不能排除生命存在的可能
do not rule out the possibility of life.

129
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:55,714
在太阳系外边缘
Out in the outer edges of our Solar System,

130
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,603
有各种各样的冰冻卫星
we see a whole variety of frozen moons orbiting the outer planets.

131
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:05,742
在木星、土星、天王星和海王星周围
Around Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune

132
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:08,202
全都是冰冻小世界
are all of these little frozen worlds.

133
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:11,867
令人吃惊的是，可能，仅仅是可能
And what's amazing is maybe, just maybe,

134
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:14,200
有一些能支持生命存在
some of them can support life.

135
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:18,486
科学家已经证实
Scientists have overwhelming evidence

136
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,951
木星的卫星木卫二
to support the notion
that on Jupiter's moon Europa

137
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:26,735
在其表面冰层下，存在着一个流动的海洋
there is an icy crust overlying
a liquid ocean underneath.

138
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:30,159
太空生物学公认
A common tenet of astrobiology

139
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,389
有液态水，生命就有可能
-- Where there is liquid water there's the chance for life.

140
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:39,592
科学家们迫切希望象冰海渔夫一样
Scientists desperately want like ice fishermen

141
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:44,132
能到冰面上去挖洞，看看能捕捉到什么样的生命
to go and dig a hole in the ice and see
what life we can pull up.

142
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:50,422
因为它会深藏于木卫二的海洋深处
'Cause it could be that deep in the heart of those oceans of Europa,

143
00:08:50,908 --> 00:08:53,611
就好比地球的海洋深处
just like deep in the heart of the Earth's oceans,

144
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:56,990
那里的火山不仅养育细菌
there's volcanoes that support not just bacteria

145
00:08:57,017 --> 00:09:00,895
还养育着全体生命群--海藻、海黄瓜
but entire colonies of life-- Seaweed, sea cucumbers.

146
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,549
我们所知道的生命，是能够在木卫二海洋存在的
Life as we know it could exist in the oceans of Europa.

147
00:09:07,955 --> 00:09:10,603
土星有一个卫星，它比较活跃
Narrator: One of Saturn's moons is a bit more active,

148
00:09:12,055 --> 00:09:14,231
不断地向太空喷射冰雪
blasting snow out into space.

149
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:18,920
土星的恩克拉多斯卫星有冰喷泉
Saturn's moon Enceladus has ice geysers.

150
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,493
科学家们在研究这些冰喷泉的时候
And scientists, in trying to find a mechanism for these geysers,

151
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:26,312
并没有在其中发现液态水
can find no good mechanism that doesn't involve liquid water.

152
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:32,102
木卫二间歇泉喷发的冰
Narrator: Ice from the erupting geysers on Enceladus

153
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:35,939
覆盖着附近卫星，使之反光得更厉害
is coating nearby moons, making them more reflective.

154
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:40,675
科学家们是如何知道这些冰冻之地
So how did scientists know that frozen places,

155
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:45,080
例如木卫二和恩克拉多斯，发生地质活动的呢？
such as Europa and Enceladus, were geologically active?

156
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:48,621
关键之处就在于它们光滑的表面
The key lies in their smooth surfaces.

157
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:53,796
通过“航行者”航天器近距离拍摄恩克拉多斯
When the Voyager Spacecraft sent back the first up-close images of Saturn's moon Enceladus,

158
00:09:54,013 --> 00:09:56,410
他们在广袤的区域里，并没有看到环形山
they saw huge regions with no craters.

159
00:09:56,437 --> 00:10:00,451
这说明了环形山被覆盖，其外观被改变了
This tells us that whatever craters were there were filled in, they were resurfaced.

160
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,140
这种现象很活跃--它们正在被覆盖
It tells us this is an active object-- Stuff's going on here.

161
00:10:05,978 --> 00:10:08,370
卫星、小行星、行星
The number of craters on a planetary surface,

162
00:10:08,613 --> 00:10:12,295
其环形山的数量，反映了表面形成的时间
moon, asteroid, planet, tells us about the age of that surface.

163
00:10:12,673 --> 00:10:15,335
在木卫四或者月球的表面
On Jupiter's moon Callisto or our own Moon,

164
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:19,173
有许多环形山，这说明其外表面非常古老
we see a lot of craters telling us we have a very old surface--

165
00:10:19,822 --> 00:10:21,565
正如这里的冰
Just like this ice here.

166
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:23,854
它明显就是旧冰
This ice is obviously old ice.

167
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:26,030
有片状的，有雪花状的
It has cuts, it has snow.

168
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:28,990
显然，它已经有一段时间没被重新修整了
Obviously it has not been resurfaced for some time.

169
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,420
这里有我们要的答案
But there's a solution for that.

行星科学家口中的“重整”
When planetary scientists talk about resurfacing,

现在，这台磨冰机走了过去
Right here, we can tell the zamboni has passed

175
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,669
我们会说，路面被重整了
-- We can tell there's been a resurfacing event.

176
00:11:08,696 --> 00:11:10,426
磨冰机走过之处
The zamboni has passed,

177
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:13,926
雪被清理，划痕被消除
clearing off the snow, eliminating the grooves.

178
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:17,729
同理，恩克拉多斯和提坦这些土星的卫星
This is just like we see on some of Saturn's moons like Enceladus and Titan,

179
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:20,513
只有新鲜的冰，看不到环形山

说明那是年轻的表面
tells us that we have a young surface.

181
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:30,175
太阳系的寒冷之地
Narrator: The cold places in the distant Solar System

182
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:33,018
虽然距离遥远，但科学家们非常感兴趣
are of extreme interest to scientists.

183
00:11:33,654 --> 00:11:36,370
研究这些太阳系的外层天体
Studying these outer bodies in our Solar System

184
00:11:36,464 --> 00:11:37,991
能让我们知道
teaches us about

185
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:41,654
最早期的太阳系由什么来组成
what the Solar System was composed of in its very initial stages.

186
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:44,403
冰封的天体意味着
So these icy bodies represent

187
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,619
物质处于太阳系初始时期的原始状态
pristine material that really represents the beginning of our Solar System and the

188
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:51,551
真实反映出构成太阳系的要素
building blocks out of which our Solar System formed.

189
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:55,659
三、二、一
Three, two, one.

190
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:00,989
美国宇航局的“新视野号”已经点火发射
We have ignition, and liftoff of NASA's New Horizons spacecraft

191
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:04,625
开始了长达十年的旅程，去拜访冥王星
on a decade-long voyage to visit the planet Pluto

192
00:12:04,652 --> 00:12:06,314
然后飞往太空深处
and then beyond.

193
00:12:09,414 --> 00:12:11,306
现在，一个新尝试正在进行
Narrator: Now a new effort is underway

194
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,874
它将更近距离地去观察
to get a closer look at some of the frozen leftovers

195
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,671
被冻结的某些太阳系初期的物质
from our Solar System's formative years.

196
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:20,571
“新视野”的任务是
The New Horizons mission is

197
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:24,644
探测太阳系外层边缘
NASA's latest mission to explore the outer edges of the Solar System.

198
00:12:24,698 --> 00:12:27,217
它是目前太阳系里速度最快的物体
It's currently the fastest moving object in the Solar System.

199
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:31,271
在2015年，它将到达曾被认为是行星的冥王星
And in 2015, it will reach the once-and-former planet Pluto.

200
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:35,744
而在冥王星之后，又到哪里呢？
Narrator: But after Pluto, where to?

201
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,849
这是一代人难得的一次机会，能够近距离地
It's a once-in-a-generation opportunity to get a close-up

202
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:43,904
去观察数十亿年前的冰封世界
look at frozen objects dating back billions of years.

203
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:49,390
唯一的问题是，科学家们还没有为新视野号确定第二个目标
The only problem-- Scientists don't yet have a second target for New Horizons.

204
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:55,267
而这个史无前例的探测器，正以超过37,000英里的时速
Without one, the probe is speeding at more than 37,000 miles an hour,

205
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:59,057
奔向冰冷黑暗的太空深处
straight for the icy blackness of deep space.

206
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:07,376
要想知道我们的太阳和行星怎样形成
Narrator: If you want to know how our Sun and planets formed,

207
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,681
只有在太阳系遥远的极冻之处
you just might find answers in

208
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:13,904
或许才能寻找到答案
the deep freeze of the distant Solar System.

209
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:19,723
新视野号的冥王星之旅
The New Horizons mission to Pluto

210
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:23,889
是想得到冥王星大量的新信息
is expected to provide a wealth of new information about the former planet.

211
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:27,237
在它与冥王星约会后
But after its rendezvous with Pluto,

212
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:31,126
我们还能怎样去了解外太空的极冻角落
what else can we learn about the coldest corners of outer space

213
00:13:31,556 --> 00:13:33,584
研究我们来自何处？
and where we came from?

214
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:37,848
这正是数以千计的科学家
That's where thousands of citizen scientists

215
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,375
努力的方向
across the world are hoping to make a difference

216
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,639
但此举无异于大海捞针
by finding a frozen needle in a haystack.

217
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,098
新视野号的任务
The New Horizons mission's destination

218
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,903
-- 拜访这个从前的行星后 -- 被确定下来了
-- After it visits this once and former planet-- Has yet to be found.

219
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:54,875
现在，世界各地的科学家
And right now there are scientists around the world

220
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:58,833
会使用“昴星”、“加-法-夏”这些最大型的望远镜
using some of the largest telescopes-- Subaru, CFHT.

221
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:01,236
去跟踪预定的太空区域
They're peering into the region of space

222
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,583
希望能发现
where we expect to find the object

223
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:05,611
沿自身轨道运行
that will have just the right orbit that it will

224
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:09,917
恰好能与新视野号会面的物体
move itself into the path of the New Horizons mission.

225
00:14:11,222 --> 00:14:13,653
但目前的棘手问题是
Now the catch is we have to find

226
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,958
我们要从数以千万计的照片中
that icy object in the outer Solar System

227
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:21,291
去寻找外太阳系里的冰冻物体
by flipping through all these thousands, millions of images.

228
00:14:22,347 --> 00:14:24,236
对普罗大众来说，这是一个机遇
Narrator: This is a chance for the general public

229
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,958
能够亲身参与探索太阳系最冷之地
to be part of the exploration of the coldest zone of the Solar System.

230
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:32,013
在这个事情上，我们需要公众的支持
This is where we need the public's help.

231
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,918
我们需要大家来帮助浏览所有照片
We need everyone with eyes to help us look through all of these images,

232
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,580
努力找到新视野号在访问冥王星后
to try and find that piece of ice

233
00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:41,648
有关冰冻物体的蛛丝马迹
that New Horizons will visit after it visits Pluto.

234
00:14:42,729 --> 00:14:46,086
只要访问网站，浏览照片
Narrator: All it takes is visiting a website and looking at images,

235
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:49,072
你就可能改变历史的发展方向
and you could change the course of history.

236
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,329
这就是项目的神奇之处
And that's the amazing thing about this project.

237
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,694
这个神秘物体
Narrator: It's expected that this mystery object

238
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,294
无论它是什么，在什么时候能被发现
-- Whatever it is and whenever it's found

239
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,767
它会是相当低温，寒冷至极的
-- will likely be cold-- very cold.

240
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:06,348
毕竟，柯伊伯带本身就是太阳系
After all, other Kuiper Belt objects are among the coldest places

241
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:07,862
最寒冷的地方
in our Solar System.

242
00:15:08,713 --> 00:15:11,024
离太阳越远
As you get further and further away from the Sun,

243
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,045
它提供给人类、航天器
its energy is less and less able to

244
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:18,314
以及一切物体保持暖和的能量就越少
keep humans, to keep spacecraft, to keep anything warm.

245
00:15:18,624 --> 00:15:21,570
温度会下降到大约开氏40度
You're down at temperatures around 40 Kelvin.

246
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:25,495
在此温度下，氮气会变成固体
These are temperatures when nitrogen becomes a solid,

247
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:27,833
二氧化碳气体会变成固体
when carbon dioxide becomes a solid,

248
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,671
所有我们所熟知的在我们大气中的气体...
when all the things we're used to thinking of as the gases in the air around us...

249
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:35,779
都会开始变成硬邦邦的东西
Start to become the ground you walk on.

250
00:15:36,563 --> 00:15:39,582
在冥王星表面
And when we look at Pluto and its surface,

251
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,217
是一个完全冰封的世界
what we're seeing is a completely frozen world

252
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:44,366
几乎没有阳光照射
that sees so little sunlight

253
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:50,812
我们通常见到的汹涌河流，或者一杯水
that the things that we're used to-- Rivers flowing, a glass of water to drink

254
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:54,185
都不会存在，即使是我们呼吸的空气
-- They can't exist, because even the air we breathe

255
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:56,088
也会冻结成为固体
would freeze out to a solid.

256
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:01,655
另一个被极寒控制的世界
Narrator: Another world dominated by deep freeze--

257
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:04,215
是一颗遥远的海王星外天体
A far-off trans-Neptunian object

258
00:16:04,242 --> 00:16:08,107
它被冠以北极冰神之名--赛德娜
named for an arctic ice goddess-- Sedna.

259
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:11,080
在外太阳系的某些物体，比如赛德娜
Some objects in the outer Solar System, like Sedna,

260
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:12,729
其轨道非常古怪
have very eccentric orbits,

261
00:16:12,756 --> 00:16:15,796
大部分时间处于太阳系的极寒中
and they spend the bulk of their time in the Solar System's deep freeze.

262
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:19,951
然而，在处于靠近太阳的一小段轨道时
However, when they come close to the Sun for a short period of their orbit,

263
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:22,032
时间大约是200年，它们会产生
like 200 years, they actually develop

264
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:24,775
非常稀疏，非常薄的大气层
a very thin, a very tenuous atmosphere.

265
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:30,437
当行星远离，这个大气层会沉积回到表面
As the planetoid recedes, that atmosphere collapses back to the surface.

266
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,956
赛德娜与太阳的距离，通常约为海王星的三倍
Sedna is currently about three times Neptune's distance from the Sun.

267
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,984
在最接近太阳的时候，是海王星的2.5倍
And upon closest approach, it's 2 1/2 times Neptune's distance.

268
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:45,524
当它运行到最远端，大约是海王星相应距离的33倍
Now, when it's farthest away, it's
about 33 times Neptune's distance.

269
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:49,760
总运行周期约为11,000年
And a total orbital period is about 11,000 years.

270
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:54,760
所以说，它最近一次接近太阳是在公元前9,000年左右
So the last time it was this close to the Sun was around 9,000 BC.

271
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:59,706
赛德娜怎么会形成这样古怪的轨道呢？
Narrator: So how did Sedna end up with such a strange orbit?

272
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:05,725
最初有人认为赛德娜被逐至目前位置
Some people initially thought that Sedna got ejected out to where it is

273
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,803
是因为与海王星的相互作用
by an interaction with Neptune.

274
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:10,982
但基于赛德娜离太阳最近时的距离
But since the closest Sedna ever gets to the Sun

275
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:15,022
是海王星的2.5倍，事情未必是这样
is 2 1/2 times Neptune's distance, this may be unlikely.

276
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:19,244
相反地，可能是一颗路过的星体
Instead, it's possible that a passing star

277
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:21,798
把赛德娜驱逐出去
actually dislodged Sedna,

278
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:26,244
让诞生在海王星附近的它，来到了目前地方
from where it formed near Neptune out to where it is right now--

279
00:17:27,163 --> 00:17:30,480
说不定，那是太阳形成之时
Perhaps even one of the stars in the cluster

280
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:33,209
众多星体中的一个
in which the Sun initially is thought to have formed.

281
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:38,844
在外太空奥尔特云核心
Sedna may be just the first known object in a whole swarm

282
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:41,939
星罗棋布的冰冻物体中
of other icy bodies that would be

283
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:46,269
赛德娜也许是我们了解的第一个
the inner part of this Oort Cloud that we think exists out there.

284
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:52,661
地球上的冰，我们通常认为
Narrator: When it comes to ice on Earth, we're usually talking about

285
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:54,553
这是水处于冰冻状态
water in its frozen state.

286
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:59,045
但在赛德娜这样的极寒地方
But ice in the deep freeze of a place like Sedna

287
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,045
冰不见得一定与水有关
doesn't necessarily refer to water.

288
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:05,032
大多数人一想到冰，就会想到
When most people think of ice, they think of the stuff

289
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:06,991
冰箱里的东西
that comes out of their freezer.

290
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,335
但科学家们口中的冰
But when scientists talk of ices,

291
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:11,875
所指的却是一个化学转变
we're just talking about a chemical transition.

292
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:14,821
我们考虑的是，怎样让它
We're talking about how you can take

293
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,997
有时是气体，有时是液体
sometimes a gas, sometimes a liquid,

294
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,429
降低它的温度，汲取它的能量
and drop its temperature, leech out the energy,

295
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:25,070
直到原子规规矩矩后，它变为固体
until the atoms change how they behave and become a solid.

296
00:18:25,516 --> 00:18:28,084
在外太阳系，我们发现氨
In the outer Solar System, we find ammonia

297
00:18:28,503 --> 00:18:29,787
--日常用的清洁剂--
-- Cleaning solution--

298
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,678
被冻结成为固体
Freezes out to a solid.

299
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:36,760
我们发现甲烷、天然气被冻结成固体
We find methane, natural gas, freezes out to a solid.

300
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:40,103
干冰--在地球上的实验室也制造--
Dry ice-- Something that we make in labs here on Earth--

301
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,509
在太阳系里充斥着
Our Solar System's completely filled with it.

302
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:47,927
对科学家来说，冰只是特别状态下的东西
To a scientist, ice is just something that is in a different state,

303
00:18:47,982 --> 00:18:51,839
当你加热它，它轻而易举地变成气体或者液体
that readily, when you add heat,
becomes either a gas or a liquid.

304
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,134
某些冰，比如这块冰结的二氧化碳
Some ices, like this frozen carbon dioxide,

305
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:05,731
不会象水一样从固体变成液体
don't go from a solid to a liquid, like water.

306
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:08,051
而是直接变成气体
Instead, they go straight into gas.

307
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:12,814
这种冰是组成冥王星、厄里斯
This type of ice is the exact same sort of stuff

308
00:19:12,842 --> 00:19:15,856
以及外太阳系其它世界的
that makes up part of the composition of Pluto and Eris,

309
00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:18,953
共同的结构材料
and many of the other outer worlds in our Solar System.

310
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,578
我们所见到的彗星尾巴
When we see a comet, when we see its tail

311
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:24,898
就是气体
what we're actually seeing is gases

312
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,286
--就象气体从这块干冰逸出一样--
-- Like the gases coming off of this dry ice--

313
00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:32,133
在太阳辐射的作用下，它们在彗星后部不断散发
That are getting streamed out behind the comet by the Sun's radiation.

314
00:19:32,828 --> 00:19:34,856
瞧，很有趣吧
Here on Earth, it's just fun to play with.

315
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:39,577
我正被无数由水构成的冰块包围着
In this room, I'm surrounded by blocks of water ice.

316
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:43,050
这种冰在地球上非常普遍
And indeed, water ice is quite common here on Earth,

317
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:48,064
甚至在太阳系的其它一些地方，比如木卫二，也是如此
and even some other places in the Solar System, like Jupiter's moon Europa.

318
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:51,258
但在某些地方，则是其它类型的冰
But there are some places that have other kinds of ices.

319
00:19:52,203 --> 00:19:53,980
比如土星的卫星泰坦
Saturn's moon Titan, for example,

320
00:19:54,008 --> 00:19:57,439
其表面是甲烷和乙烷的冰块
has methane and ethane ices on its surface.

321
00:19:58,008 --> 00:20:01,272
所以说，由水形成的冰不是冰的唯一类型
So water ice is not the only kind of ice that there is.

322
00:20:03,314 --> 00:20:07,147
要观察冰的多样化，最适当对象...
Narrator: If you're looking for a variety of ices in one convenient location,

323
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:09,522
莫过于彗星
check out a comet.

324
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:12,633
研究彗星的好处是
What's exciting about studying comets

325
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:15,911
你能观察到组成我们太阳系
is that you're seeing the material out of which our whole Solar System,

326
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:18,230
包括地球在内的物质
including the Earth, was made

327
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:22,883
它在太阳系演变早期，一下子被冻结起来了
-- Flash-frozen at an early time in the Solar System's evolution.

328
00:20:23,674 --> 00:20:28,063
许多科学家相信，彗星是地球上广袤海洋的源泉...
Narrator: Many scientists believe comets are responsible for Earth's vast oceans...

329
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:33,271
无数世纪的彗星撞击，把液态水带到了地球表面
That eons of comet impacts brought liquid water to Earth's surface.

330
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:38,952
果真如此的话，这些携带水份的彗星或许是
If that's the case, these water-carrying comets are likely responsible

331
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:41,771
地球上每一个生命的始作俑者
for every living thing on the planet.

332
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:48,466
哪一个更寒冷呢，彗星还是小行星？
So what's colder-- A comet or an asteroid?

333
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:55,063
这是来自爱荷华州的特拉维斯，对《询问宇宙》提出的问题
That's what Travis S. of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, wanted to 《ask the universe》

334
00:20:56,132 --> 00:20:59,174
特拉维斯，彗星在穿越太空的大部分旅程中
Travis, comets are actually colder than asteroids

335
00:20:59,202 --> 00:21:01,340
比小行星更为寒冷
over most of their journey through space.

336
00:21:01,604 --> 00:21:06,090
这是因为彗星出自太阳系的极冻之地
And that's because comets start out from the deep freeze of the Solar System.

337
00:21:06,646 --> 00:21:08,687
那里非常寒冷
That's really cold out there.

338
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:12,507
而小行星总是相当接近太阳
Asteroids are always reasonably close to the Sun,

339
00:21:12,535 --> 00:21:14,854
所以它们普遍比彗星暖和
so they're,in general, warmer than comets.

340
00:21:17,757 --> 00:21:20,854
冰冻的彗星，冰封的小行星...
Narrator: Frozen comets, icy asteroids...

341
00:21:21,132 --> 00:21:24,437
被冰雪覆盖的世界是怎样的情形？
But what about whole worlds covered in ice and snow?

342
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:28,784
我们寻找的宇宙最冷之地
As we continue our search for the coldest places in the universe,

343
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,090
温度会是多低呢？
how low can we go?

344
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:35,423
在行星表面冰层下存活的生命
And could life survive under the icy surface of a planet

345
00:21:35,646 --> 00:21:37,715
能否在星体之间漫游？
wandering between the stars?

346
00:21:41,826 --> 00:21:44,437
寒冷在宇宙里扮演着关键角色
Narrator: Cold plays a key role in our universe.

347
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:48,159
它是保护介质，保护着生命元素
It's a preserving medium-- A protector against

348
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,748
比如氢、氧和碳
the scattering of life-giving elements such as hydrogen,

349
00:21:50,951 --> 00:21:52,576
不会流失
oxygen, and carbon.

350
00:21:53,423 --> 00:21:56,548
宇宙的极寒之地可能藏有
The coldest places in our universe may hold answers

351
00:21:56,562 --> 00:22:00,117
关于人类从哪里来这些根本问题的答案
to fundamental questions about where we came from.

352
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:05,131
所以，关键是找到一个总处于冰川期的世界
So imagine a world where it's always an ice age.

353
00:22:06,173 --> 00:22:11,131
在科幻小说里，冰冻星球普遍存在，比如霍斯（星球大战）、鲁拉・彭塞（星际旅行）
In science fiction, ice planets are common-- Hoth, Rura Penthe.

354
00:22:11,187 --> 00:22:13,812
还有，谁能忘记《太空堡垒卡拉狄加》？
And who could forget the Gun On Ice Planet Zero?

355
00:22:14,992 --> 00:22:19,270
但事实上，科学事实或许会让科幻小说黯然失色
Narrator: But here, science fiction may be eclipsed by science fact.

356
00:22:19,936 --> 00:22:24,034
研究人员正在寻找酷似霍斯的外星球
Researchers are looking for exoplanets that could really be like Hoth

357
00:22:24,186 --> 00:22:27,051
希望找到《帝国反击战》里
-- The ice world from The Empire Strikes Back--

358
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,172
广袤、遍布岩石、满地白雪的世界
Large, rocky, and snow-covered.

359
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:34,103
霍斯是拥有充沛水量
Hoth was kind of a realistic depiction of what a planet

360
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:38,339
但因为远离恒星，水被冻结成冰
might be if it's sufficiently covered with water that's then frozen

361
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:40,686
这样的行星的真实写照
because it's too far from the star.

362
00:22:41,158 --> 00:22:45,144
宇宙里有这样的行星，它有结冰的海洋
You could have a planet that basically has just a-- a frozen ocean

363
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:47,936
但没有大片陆地露出来
with no land continents sticking out.

364
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,491
一个完全冰封的行星并不是吹嘘出来的
It turns out that an all-ice planet is not only realistic,

365
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:54,130
地球就有过数次这样的经历
it's happened to Earth several times in our history.

366
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,241
地球曾经数次被完全冰封
Several occasions the Earth has completely frozen over.

367
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:01,102
我们称此时的地球为“雪球地球”
We call that phase "snowball Earth."

368
00:23:01,352 --> 00:23:04,200
当时出现冰原大扩展
What happens is that the ice sheet grows.

369
00:23:04,227 --> 00:23:06,186
地球变冷，出现更多的冰
Earth cools-- We get more ice.

370
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:08,797
发亮的冰反射阳光
Ice is light-- It reflects off sunlight.

371
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,241
地球更冷，冰更多
Earth cools, you get more ice.

372
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:13,838
于是反射阳光更多，冰就更多，造成急剧冰封
Reflect off more sunlight, more ice, and you get a runaway freeze.

373
00:23:14,297 --> 00:23:17,352
后来情况发生变化，局部地方温暖起来
And then something changed, and good fractions of it warmed up,

374
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,116
冰川发生融化
and the glaciers melted.

375
00:23:19,491 --> 00:23:22,047
你可能会以为
In fact, you might expect that

376
00:23:22,088 --> 00:23:25,009
地球大部分时间都处于冰冻之中
the Earth should be frozen most of the time.

377
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:27,171
但实际并非如此，这是因为
And the reason it's not is that

378
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:30,214
厚厚的大气层留住了许多热量
we have a thick atmosphere that retains a lot of the heat.

379
00:23:30,435 --> 00:23:34,713
如果没有大气层，由于地球到太阳非常远
If we didn't have the atmosphere, Earth is at such a great distance from the Sun

380
00:23:34,741 --> 00:23:37,435
水将会被冻结
that, in fact, the water should be frozen.

381
00:23:40,213 --> 00:23:46,203
在2012年，科学家确认的太阳系外行星超过700个
Narrator: By 2012, scientists had identified more than 700 extra solar planets

382
00:23:47,122 --> 00:23:50,095
--每年都能保持这个数量的增长
-- A number that keeps climbing every year.

383
00:23:51,271 --> 00:23:55,101
其中许多是气体巨星，极其类似于木星和土星
Many are gas giants-- Worlds that more closely resemble

384
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:57,412
但与地球截然不同
Jupiter and Saturn than Earth.

385
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,939
要检测到微弱的冰雪世界很困难
Detecting smaller snowy worlds is a difficult

386
00:24:02,115 --> 00:24:04,304
但并非不可能
but not impossible task.

387
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:06,831
我们现在的检测方法
Our current detection methods

388
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:11,931
偏重于发现非常巨大，非常靠近其核心星体的行星
tend to find very large planets very close to their parent stars.

389
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:14,769
当检测方法再先进一些
As our detection methods grow better,

390
00:24:14,796 --> 00:24:17,080
我们就可能发现更多冰冻星球
we're likely to find more frozen worlds.

391
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:22,477
有一颗行星，被人们称为
Narrator: One such world-- The planet known as

392
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:28,139
“OGLE-2005-BLG-390LB”行星
OGLE-2005-BLG-390LB.

393
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,407
人们相信，它的大小是地球的五倍
It's believed to be about five times the Earth's size,

394
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,545
按研究人员的说法
and, according to researchers,

395
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:37,795
它由与地球相似的岩石和冰构成
could consist of Earthlike rocks and ice.

396
00:24:38,976 --> 00:24:42,198
这个外行星与它的太阳的距离
The distance of this exoplanet from its sun

397
00:24:42,226 --> 00:24:47,045
等于火星到我们太阳的距离，或者稍远一点
is about the same, or may be a little further, than Mars is from our Sun.

398
00:24:47,823 --> 00:24:49,351
如果放在我们太阳系里
So in our Solar System,

399
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,601
它将位于火星和木星之间
it would reside between Mars and Jupiter.

400
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,406
这个外行星的有趣之处，是它的质量
This particular exoplanet is interesting in that

401
00:24:56,476 --> 00:24:59,406
大约是地球的五倍
it has about five times Earth's mass.

402
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:01,726
因此，它被看作是超级地球
So it's considered a super-Earth

403
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:05,003
是目前发现的质量最小的外行星之一
-- One of the lower mass exoplanets ever found.

404
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:09,656
但它的温度可能只比绝对零度多50度
But it's temperature could be only 50 degrees above absolute zero.

405
00:25:09,795 --> 00:25:13,850
所以它应当是一个巨大的、冰封的类地行星
So this would be an icy, large Earthlike planet.

406
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,072
其它类型的黑暗冰冻的外行星
Narrator: Another type of exoplanet that's expected to be dark and freezing--

407
00:25:20,878 --> 00:25:22,493
是流浪行星
Rogue planets.

408
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,156
这些行星，由于这样或那样的原因
These are planets that, for one reason or another,

409
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,211
被它们的太阳系抛弃到
have been hurled from their solar systems

410
00:25:29,517 --> 00:25:33,294
恒星之间冰冻的虚无地带
-- Cast off into the icy
nothingness between stars.

411
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:37,961
众所周知，行星沿轨道绕恒星运行
As far as we know, planets form orbiting stars.

412
00:25:38,308 --> 00:25:39,961
但它们不会一成不变
They don't have to stay there.

413
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,933
重力的作用
Gravity can actually cause planets

414
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:46,155
会让行星弹射出它们的太阳系
to get slingshotted out of their solar systems.

415
00:25:46,405 --> 00:25:50,683
最终使得流浪行星不能环绕恒星运行
And this is where you can end up with rogue worlds not orbiting a star,

416
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:52,572
相反地，要在它们之间漂泊
but instead, traveling between them.

417
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,405
没有恒星提供温暖
Narrator: Without a star to provide warmth,

418
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:00,488
这些行星可能会处在黑暗、寒冷和荒凉之中
these planets are likely to be dark, cold, and barren.

419
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:03,683
但是寒冷并不意味着死亡
But cold doesn't mean dead.

420
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:06,933
许多科学家相信，非常有可能的是
And many scientists believe that it's quite possible

421
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:11,155
即使是在太空里游荡数十亿年之后
that life could exist under the frozen oceans of a rogue planet,

422
00:26:11,183 --> 00:26:14,738
生命仍存在于流浪行星的冰冻海洋之下
even after a billion years of wandering through space.

423
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,752
当它们远离恒星而去
Once they're far away from the star,

424
00:26:17,766 --> 00:26:20,718
就会被冻结起来，被包裹得很严实
they could freeze out and become quite icy.

425
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,182
人们还猜想
But it's also conjectured that

426
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,099
它们中的某些会保留厚厚的大气层
some of them could retain a thick atmosphere,

427
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,557
从而保留了行星上
which would then keep the heat trapped in,

428
00:26:28,585 --> 00:26:31,627
通过地热和放射性衰退
that's created through geothermal processes

429
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:34,530
所产生的热量
and radioactive decay within the planet.

430
00:26:34,613 --> 00:26:38,682
所以，不是所有的它们都会表面完全冰封
So not all of them are necessarily completely frozen at their surface.

431
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,085
随着宇宙视野的扩大
Narrator: As our view of the cosmos improves,

432
00:26:43,627 --> 00:26:47,140
我们认定的流浪行星数量不断增加
our estimate of the number of rogue planets keeps climbing.

433
00:26:48,418 --> 00:26:50,640
通过最近的模拟，我们认为
Recent simulation suggests
there may be twice as many

434
00:26:50,654 --> 00:26:54,154
银河系的流浪行星数量是恒星的两倍
rogue planets in the galaxy as there are stars.

435
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:58,501
假如路过的天体把地球从太阳系抛出去
Narrator: So what would happen if a passing star sent Earth

436
00:26:58,515 --> 00:27:00,307
会发生什么事情呢？
spinning out of our Solar System?

437
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:04,390
随着整个行星的漂移
As the entire planet goes rogue,

438
00:27:04,973 --> 00:27:08,196
骤然进入寒冷漆黑的太空深处
tumbling out into the cold blackness of deep space,

439
00:27:09,098 --> 00:27:10,793
生命能幸存吗？
would life survive?

440
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:15,334
果真如此，虽然不是全部能量会快速消散
If that happened, we'd very quickly radiate away

441
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,775
但绝大部分会
not all our energy, but a lot of it.

442
00:27:17,973 --> 00:27:21,112
海洋会冰冻，大气会变成固体
The oceans would freeze, the
atmosphere would become a solid.

443
00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:23,529
我们会被抛弃，可能会死亡
We'd be left，probably dead.

444
00:27:23,918 --> 00:27:27,404
整个世界里只剩下毫无生气的城市
But imagine finding that world later on, intact with its cities.

445
00:27:27,918 --> 00:27:30,087
我们不必担心这样的命运
We don't have to worry about this fate.

446
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:35,251
但文明的发展很微妙，你永远不知道接下来的事
But a civilization growing up around a binary star -- You never know what could happen.

447
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:39,528
人类也许不能幸存下来...
Narrator: Humans may not be able to survive...

448
00:27:40,306 --> 00:27:43,320
但在海洋之下，结了冰的水
But under the sea, the way our water freezes

449
00:27:43,987 --> 00:27:46,348
会给予生命一个竞争的机会
would give life a fighting chance.

450
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:51,014
帮助鱼类安全留在地球的因素之一
One of the things that helps keep fish here on the planet Earth safe

451
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:54,223
是我们日常的水--氧化氢
is our normal water-- Our H2O water.

452
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,514
当它冰结的时候，会由上向下
When it freezes, it freezes from the top down,

453
00:27:57,639 --> 00:28:01,972
这就能给予鱼类保护，让它能在冰面下游弋
leaving the fish safely protected and swimming beneath the frozen surface.

454
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:06,597
如果是另一个世界，一个正处于极冻的世界
Now if we go to another world-- One experiencing a deep freeze

455
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:11,417
这个外行星可能会有氨气海洋或者甲烷湖泊
-- That alien planet might have ammonia oceans or methane lakes.

456
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:14,306
当这些液体结冰时
And those liquids, as they freeze,

457
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:17,861
会从底部一直冰结到表面
they freeze from the bottom all the way up to the surface

458
00:28:18,153 --> 00:28:22,889
让这些冰湖里的鱼类无处容身
-- Leaving any fish living in those frozen lakes flapping around on the surface.

459
00:28:23,153 --> 00:28:25,403
这可不是养鱼的好地方
And that's not a good place for a fish to be.

460
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:29,389
如果地球变成流浪行星
If Earth were to become a rogue planet,

461
00:28:29,653 --> 00:28:33,784
我们会在非常深海的俯冲带，看到生命群体
the life forms we see at the very depths of the ocean in subduction zones,

462
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:38,486
那里有暖流冒出，使得局部海洋充斥着非常热的水
where these thermal vents are filling the local ocean with very very hot water

463
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:43,875
生命群会若无其事地存活几百万年，或几十亿年
-- Those life forms would go on like nothing ever happened for millions, maybe billions of years.

464
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:47,986
所以在一个流浪的冰封行星上，在非常深的地方
So it's very possible that in the very depths of an ice planet

465
00:28:48,013 --> 00:28:50,944
生命的存在非常有可能
that's gone rogue, life could exist.

466
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:57,222
生命能在流浪行星存在，但不会永远存在
Narrator: Life could exist on a rogue planet, but not forever.

467
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:02,583
毕竟，太空非常非常寒冷
After all, space is very, very cold,

468
00:29:02,972 --> 00:29:07,083
所以说，得感谢温暖，是它给了地球生命
and life-giving Earth remains, thankfully, warmer.

469
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,019
我们地球靠近太阳
We're close to the Sun.

470
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:13,707
而宇宙里有代表性的地方，它远离任何星系或恒星
The typical place in the universe, far from any galaxy or star,

471
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:18,896
其温度只比绝对零度多2.7度
has a temperature of only 2.7 degrees above absolute zero.

472
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:21,846
这是太空本身的温度
That's the temperature of space itself

473
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,513
--相当低温，极为冰冷
-- Really cold, a really deep freeze.

474
00:29:27,193 --> 00:29:31,221
宇宙间最冷的自然现象是什么呢？
Narrator: So what is the coldest naturally occurring place in the universe?

475
00:29:31,554 --> 00:29:35,096
它能营造非常巨大的寒冷环境
It's a place where a simple principle you can test in your

476
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:38,401
但其原理很简单，你在家里也能尝试
home has led to a very big chill.

477
00:29:41,249 --> 00:29:44,915
在探索了我们最近邻居的寒冷之后
Narrator: Having explored the role of coldness in our immediate neighborhood,

478
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:49,818
我们现在去一个更寒冷的地方
we now embark on a journey to even more frigid places.

479
00:29:52,054 --> 00:29:54,373
天文学者最近发现了
Astronomers have recently discovered

480
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:58,790
他们认为可能是迄今为止最寒冷的类星体
what they think may be the coldest star-like object ever found,

481
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:02,429
其距离地球仅为40光年
a mere 40 light-years away from Earth.

482
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,957
它是一颗被称为Y型的褐矮星
It's what's called a "Y" class brown dwarf.

483
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:12,193
按科学家的形容，它的表面
And according to scientists, the temperature on its surface

484
00:30:12,762 --> 00:30:15,392
几乎和春季的白天那么暖和
is about that of a warm spring day.

485
00:30:16,123 --> 00:30:20,540
就在2011年，我们首次发现了这种最冷的Y矮星
Just in 2011, we found the coldest "y" dwarf ever found.

486
00:30:20,915 --> 00:30:23,317
它的温度相当低
And this is an object that's so cool

487
00:30:23,345 --> 00:30:27,123
比人类的体温还要低
that it's actually cooler than you or I, as human beings, are.

488
00:30:27,331 --> 00:30:30,151
其温度刚好是华氏80度
And this is an object that's just 80 degrees fahrenheit.

489
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:37,026
我们太阳的温度为华氏10,000度
Our Sun, by comparison, registers at a toasty

490
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:39,498
比它温暖得多了
10,000 degrees fahrenheit.

491
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:45,636
因此，这颗褐矮星是恒星吗？或者不是？
So is this brown dwarf a star, or not a star?

492
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:53,511
褐矮星是介于行星和成熟恒星之间的天体
A brown dwarf is sort of intermediate between a planet and a full-fledged star.

493
00:30:53,692 --> 00:30:57,053
比起木星般大小的行星，它的质量要大得多
It's more massive than even a Jupiter-sized planet.

494
00:30:57,206 --> 00:30:59,525
但它的质量不足以
But it's not massive enough to ever have

495
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:03,497
在核心产生持续的原子核聚变
had sustained nuclear fusion in its core.

496
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:08,761
真正的恒星，其原子核聚变会持续很长很长时间
So a true star has nuclear fusion going on for a long, long time.

497
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:13,011
而褐矮星只有短暂的原子核聚变
A brown dwarf has nuclear fusion for just a short time.

498
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:16,525
褐矮星填补了我们所说的
What brown dwarfs do is they bridge the gap between

499
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,164
行星和恒星之间的断层
what we call planets and what we call stars.

500
00:31:19,692 --> 00:31:22,747
褐矮星的冷，不只是因为自身冷
So brown dwarf are cool, not only because they are cold, but

501
00:31:22,775 --> 00:31:25,914
还因为它们有大量的奇异物质
because they have a lot of exotic stuff going on in them.

502
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:29,733
这些类似恒星的天体，温度相当低
Because they have such low temperatures, you can actually get clouds

503
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:32,650
所以在外层大气里有云团
in the outer atmospheres of these almost-stars.

504
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:36,052
那些会是冰云团
And these can be either icy clouds or,

505
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:38,969
在某些个案中，甚至会是铁云团
in some cases, they can be even iron clouds.

506
00:31:39,025 --> 00:31:43,261
所以我们认为某些褐矮星可能存在着铁雨
So we think that some brown dwarfs actually might have iron rain

507
00:31:43,274 --> 00:31:45,636
铁质被凝结到外大气层
-- Where iron condenses out of the atmosphere

508
00:31:45,663 --> 00:31:47,997
然后象下雨般落到低层
and rains down into the lower layers.

509
00:31:48,344 --> 00:31:51,830
但即使是非常寒冷，还是
But even with the coolest kinds, you can get ices much like the

510
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:55,955
会有仿似木星云斑一样的冰
ones that we see in the cloudy bands that are on Jupiter,

511
00:31:56,233 --> 00:31:59,302
存在于这些既类似恒星又类似行星的天体上
in these almost-stars but almost-planets.

512
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:03,774
让我们继续向外太空进发
Narrator: As we continue to move out into the universe,

513
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:09,066
假如我们突然间来到离地球400光年的地方...
we get about 400 light-years away from Earth when suddenly...

514
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,538
群星闪烁，温度下降
Stars appear to wink out of existence, the temperature drops,

515
00:32:15,024 --> 00:32:19,732
我们会与黑漆漆的“巴纳德68”相遇
and we encounter the inky blackness called "Barnard 68."

516
00:32:20,885 --> 00:32:23,927
巴纳德68很奇特，因为你看不到它
"Barnard 68" is significant because of what you don't see.

517
00:32:23,982 --> 00:32:26,399
它是一团黑块
It's just a black patch.

518
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:29,315
没有光从那里发出来，也没有光穿越它
There's no light coming from it, there's no light coming through it.

519
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:33,621
它是天空里既黑漆漆又不透明的地方
It is a black opaque spot on the sky.

520
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:37,982
这种物体，让人以为是天幕上的小洞
Narrator: What was once thought of as a hole in the sky

521
00:32:38,204 --> 00:32:41,787
如今被称为暗分子云
is now known as a dark molecular cloud.

522
00:32:43,204 --> 00:32:46,135
暗分子云是太空里的巨大云团
Dark molecular clouds are huge clouds in space,

523
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:48,426
它由气体和尘埃组成
of gas and dust, and when we say "dust"

524
00:32:48,454 --> 00:32:51,051
“尘埃”是指小颗粒的水和硅酸盐
we mean little chunks of water and silicates

525
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:53,496
并不是清扫厨房时的东西
not unlike you would sweep off your countertop.

526
00:32:53,704 --> 00:32:56,773
阳光和星光
Sunlight, starlight, is only able to

527
00:32:56,857 --> 00:33:01,246
只能穿透气体云团最外面的区域
penetrate the outermost regions of the gas cloud.

528
00:33:01,634 --> 00:33:04,065
当你逐渐深入内部
As you move deeper and deeper within,

529
00:33:04,245 --> 00:33:08,731
这个不透明系统会阻挡所有可见光的波长
this opaque system blocks all the visible wavelengths of light.

530
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:11,315
只有红外线能够畅通无阻地
Only the infrared light is able to make it

531
00:33:11,343 --> 00:33:13,579
进入到云团深处
all the way into the depths of the cloud.

532
00:33:13,815 --> 00:33:16,356
这就保证了云团不会变热
And this protects the cloud from heating up and,

533
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:19,481
从而使这些云团内部
in fact, makes the inside of these clouds

534
00:33:19,523 --> 00:33:23,551
成为宇宙间最阴森和最寒冷的地方
one of the most shadowed places and one of the coolest places in the universe.

535
00:33:25,176 --> 00:33:29,023
“巴纳德68”不仅外围冷达开氏16度
Not only is "Barnard 68" a nippy 16 kelvins at its periphery,

536
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,467
当你越深入，还会更冷
as you work your way in, it actually gets colder.

537
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:33,995
这是一个寒冷的云团
This is one cold cloud.

538
00:33:35,384 --> 00:33:39,273
“巴纳德68”这样的物体，最神奇的地方之一
One of the most amazing things about objects like "Barnard 68"

539
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,259
是它们位于目前宇宙最冷物体的行列
is that right now they're some of the coldest things in the universe.

540
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:47,731
但自身物质会让它们霍然崩塌，并触发恒星的形成
But all it takes is a shockwave to collapse them down and trigger star formation.

541
00:33:48,217 --> 00:33:51,064
在恒星--最巨型的恒星--最早形成时
And the first stars to form--The largest stars to form--

542
00:33:51,272 --> 00:33:53,661
它们就成为了宇宙间最炽热的物体之一
Are some of the hottest things in the universe.

543
00:33:55,842 --> 00:33:59,550
所以说，某一个暗分子云会在某一瞬间成为
So in one instant, one of these dark molecular clouds

544
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:01,718
当前环境中最炽热的物体
can become the hottest thing around.

545
00:34:01,994 --> 00:34:05,383
但在这一瞬间之前，却是宇宙里最寒冷的
But the moment before, they were the coolest things in the universe.

546
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:10,008
让我们继续行程...
Narrator: Continue our trip...

547
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,661
这次我们来到目前宇宙里已知的最冷地方
And we've arrived at the coldest place we know of in the universe

548
00:34:15,828 --> 00:34:19,286
这里距离地球大约5,000光年
-- Approximately 5,000 light-years away from Earth.

549
00:34:21,022 --> 00:34:23,994
我们现在进入了布莫让星云
We are now entering the Boomerang nebula.

550
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,050
这个领结形状的星云
This bow-tie shaped nebula

551
00:34:26,077 --> 00:34:29,133
比宇宙里其它地方都要冷
is actually colder than the restof the universe.

552
00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:31,855
它因为向外喷溅
It's been chilled by the outflow of gas

553
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:36,202
接近于华氏-458度的气体而变冷
to approximately negative 458 degrees fahrenheit

554
00:34:36,494 --> 00:34:39,772
温度只比绝对零度高1度
-- Just one degree above absolute zero.

555
00:34:40,952 --> 00:34:43,147
布莫让星云
The Boomerang nebula consists of

556
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:46,924
由濒死恒星快速扩散出来的气体组成
rapidly expanding gases from a dying star.

557
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,494
这些气体的扩散速度非常快
And those gases expand so quickly,

558
00:34:49,605 --> 00:34:54,188
使得它们变冷，其温度低于周围太空环境的温度
that they've cooled to a temperature below that of the surrounding space.

559
00:34:54,674 --> 00:34:58,660
它能达到极端低温，部分原因在于
And part of the reason it's able to achieve its extremely low temperature

560
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,355
它是由扩散气体所组成的
is simply because it's made of expanding gas.

561
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:04,174
这些扩散气体，就象...
And expanding gas, just like...

562
00:35:05,216 --> 00:35:07,257
这个罐里的一样...
The expanding gas in this can...

563
00:35:08,729 --> 00:35:12,285
气体扩散时，体积变大，温度就会下降
Drops in temperature as the gas spreads out over a larger volume.

564
00:35:12,729 --> 00:35:15,896
说起来，我能让这些每天都喝的水...
In fact, I'm able to take this everyday drinking water...

565
00:35:18,229 --> 00:35:20,354
水现在是室温...
This room temperature drinking water...

566
00:35:21,007 --> 00:35:24,590
我将用罐里的气体让它结冰
And freeze it with the gas coming out of this can.

567
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:32,904
=========翻译/时间轴:annwayili=========
（如有不当，请多包涵，不吝指导！谢谢！）

568
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,114
我不是说，布莫让星云会有冰
Now I'm not going to claim that the Boomerang has ice,

569
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:43,368
但你应该明白了，少许扩散气体就能够引发严寒
but you can see that a little expanding gas can create one heck of a deep freeze.

570
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:47,993
利用现代技术
Narrator: Using modern technology,

571
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:52,229
我们能够在实验室里得到更低的温度
it is possible to create even lower temperatures in a lab.

572
00:35:53,062 --> 00:35:55,840
所以宇宙间真正低温的地方，或许...
So the true coldest place in the universe may be

573
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:58,757
就在地球这里
right here on planet Earth.

574
00:35:59,854 --> 00:36:01,673
在实验室里
Narrator: In laboratory experiments,

575
00:36:01,812 --> 00:36:04,395
我们现在能够达到非常低的温度
we can reach very low temperatures now.

576
00:36:04,492 --> 00:36:06,659
最低曾达到1/2纳度
In fact, the lowest temperature ever reached

577
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:12,437
1纳度就是十亿分之一的开氏温度
is something like 1/2 of a nanokelvin -- A billionth of a degree.

578
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:13,978
这真的很低了
That's really low.

579
00:36:16,353 --> 00:36:20,576
当温度降到接近绝对零度
Narrator: As the temperature in these experiments approaches absolute zero,

580
00:36:20,964 --> 00:36:23,659
在物质身上发生了奇异的事情
weird things start happening to matter.

581
00:36:24,145 --> 00:36:27,409
原子受极度低温的作用，凝聚在一起
Atoms react to the deep freeze by clumping together in

582
00:36:27,423 --> 00:36:29,466
以离奇的方式排列
a bizarre form of matter.

583
00:36:30,284 --> 00:36:35,284
所有原子进入同一种状态
This is where the atoms all go into essentially the same state.

584
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,686
它们的行为表现很类似，甚至是一样的
That is, they behave in a similar way or even the same way.

585
00:36:41,436 --> 00:36:43,847
从而使得物质很奇异
These are weird, weird substances.

586
00:36:45,158 --> 00:36:49,839
超低温物质甚至能使光停下它的脚步
Narrator: Super-cold substances that can even stop light in its tracks.

587
00:36:51,311 --> 00:36:55,297
在最低温的情况下，我们能够让一束光停止
One of the coolest things we can do is actually stop a beam of light.

588
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:59,533
这好象很疯狂，但我们确是能够获取一束光
I know it sounds insane, but we can take a beam of light

589
00:36:59,644 --> 00:37:01,492
并让它慢下来
and be able to slow it down,

590
00:37:01,714 --> 00:37:04,728
然后操控它去做你想做的事
and then play with it, do whatever you want with it,

591
00:37:04,964 --> 00:37:06,269
然后再把它释放
and then release it again.

592
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,561
你可以让它停下来
One of the things that you can do with that is stop it,

593
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,630
操控它进入电子信号里
turn it into an electrical signal,

594
00:37:12,658 --> 00:37:15,408
然后又释放它，并让它重回到光束内
and then re-release it and turn it back into light.

595
00:37:15,644 --> 00:37:20,630
这非常有趣，它可以在电子学上有各种应用
And this is really interesting, because it has all kinds of practical applications in electronics.

596
00:37:23,477 --> 00:37:26,630
这仅是极度低温如何改变
Narrator: It's just another example of how a really deep freeze

597
00:37:26,658 --> 00:37:30,602
宇宙万物根本特性的另一个例子
seems to transform fundamental properties of the universe.

598
00:37:31,824 --> 00:37:35,088
此外，许多科学家相信宇宙本身
Then again, many scientists believe the universe itself

599
00:37:35,116 --> 00:37:38,546
正处在一个不可更改的根本转变中
is in for one final fundamental transformation

600
00:37:38,894 --> 00:37:41,560
最终进入深冻的状态...
-- To a permanent state of deep freeze...

601
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,699
届时，没有回头路了
From which there is no return.

602
00:37:47,658 --> 00:37:50,171
宇宙难逃一死
Narrator: The universe is doomed.

603
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,741
某些研究所有实体最后阶段的物理学家
That's the belief of a number of
physicists who study potential

604
00:37:54,755 --> 00:37:56,338
对此坚信不疑
endgames for all existence.

605
00:38:00,435 --> 00:38:03,977
所有星体的热量与力量
All of the heat and power that was present at the start of time

606
00:38:04,004 --> 00:38:07,129
会随着时间缓慢地、平静地溜走
is slowly, quietly, slipping away.

607
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:11,060
宇宙历史的漫长故事
The whole story of the history of the universe

608
00:38:11,227 --> 00:38:15,865
始于巨大能量在大爆炸时的注入
starts from the injection of this enormous amount of energy in the Big Bang,

609
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:20,032
也将终结于宇宙扩张时的消散
and watching it dissipate as the universe expands.

610
00:38:21,504 --> 00:38:23,962
源自大爆炸的宇宙
Narrator: A universe that begins with a Big Bang,

611
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:28,546
它的持续扩张，最终将使能量不足
and continues to expand, will eventually have an energy shortage

612
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:30,962
而这是无法解决的
for which there is no solution.

613
00:38:33,184 --> 00:38:36,573
在某种意义上，宇宙正在缓慢松懈下来
In a sense, the universe is slowly winding down,

614
00:38:36,837 --> 00:38:39,907
就好比上紧发条的玩具
kind of like when you wind up the spring in a wind-up toy

615
00:38:39,921 --> 00:38:41,962
让它运行一段时间
and you let that toy run for a while.

616
00:38:42,073 --> 00:38:44,351
最终，所有能量会消耗殆尽
Eventually all the energy gets used up

617
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:47,795
--发条上会没有任何能量
-- There's nothing stored in the spring anymore.

618
00:38:47,851 --> 00:38:51,101
你得再次拧紧发条，才能让玩具动起来
And you'd have to wind it up again to get it to do something interesting.

619
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:55,045
这些玩具拥有一点点能量
These toys have some initial energy.

620
00:38:55,281 --> 00:38:57,906
在短暂运动之后
And as they go through their little motions,

621
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:01,087
能量被使用，然后消失
you're seeing that energy be used up and dissipated.

622
00:39:01,448 --> 00:39:03,684
最后，这些玩具会停下来
Eventually, these toys will stop.

623
00:39:03,712 --> 00:39:06,142
它们将处在最低能量状态
They'll be in their lowest energy state.

624
00:39:06,365 --> 00:39:10,309
不可能再输出能量
And there'll be no more possible energy output from them.

625
00:39:13,948 --> 00:39:16,045
当所有星体死亡
Well, once all the stars have died

626
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:19,503
--当所有能量扩散到整个宇宙
-- Once all the energy has spread out uniformly in the universe

627
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:21,545
--将会没有任何动静
-- Nothing interesting happens.

628
00:39:21,656 --> 00:39:25,323
因为，正如没有拧紧发条的玩具
Because, like the wind-up toy, it's not wound up.

629
00:39:25,392 --> 00:39:27,850
宇宙的发条不再会被拧紧了
The universe isn't wound up anymore.

630
00:39:29,364 --> 00:39:33,086
宇宙本身还在变大，还在扩张
Narrator: But the universe itself is getting larger--Expanding--

631
00:39:33,434 --> 00:39:37,295
却没有新的能量或热量进入系统
And there is no new energy or heat coming into that system.

632
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:40,614
如果宇宙不停止自身的扩张
If the universe doesn't tear itself apart first,

633
00:39:40,808 --> 00:39:43,558
宇宙会终结为一个极冻的世界
the universe will end as a deep freeze

634
00:39:43,878 --> 00:39:47,156
--寒冷、黑暗而且压抑
-- Cold... dark... and depressing.

635
00:39:50,169 --> 00:39:51,713
太阳们烧光
Narrator: Suns burn out.

636
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:54,378
行星们被毁灭
Planets are destroyed.

637
00:39:57,919 --> 00:40:02,961
星系碰撞、坍塌、燃烧，然后散架
Galaxies collide, collapse, ignite, then fall apart--

638
00:40:03,683 --> 00:40:06,128
冰块四处飘散
Frozen shells of their former selves.

639
00:40:08,905 --> 00:40:11,252
在几百个数十亿年之后
Over hundreds of billions of years,

640
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:14,863
宇宙的每一点能量都被利用了
every bit of energy in our universe gets used up

641
00:40:15,725 --> 00:40:18,211
--消失在无限扩张的太空
--Lost to the ever-expanding void

642
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:24,252
宇宙的熵会达到致命的最大状态
as the entropy of our universe reaches a final fatal maximum state.

643
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:29,266
最终，它会扩张到极点
Eventually, it will expand to the point

644
00:40:29,335 --> 00:40:31,933
届时将没有热量留在宇宙里
where there will be no heat left in the universe.

645
00:40:32,335 --> 00:40:33,822
这意味着没有化学反应
That means no chemical reactions.

646
00:40:34,238 --> 00:40:35,807
意味着没有生物作用
That means no biological reactions.

647
00:40:36,002 --> 00:40:37,460
你看到的将是
What you will see is

648
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:44,960
--宇宙的最终阶段看起来什么也没有...
-- The final state of our universe is really just going to look like a whole lot of nothing...

649
00:40:45,335 --> 00:40:48,543
什么也看不到--没有黑洞，没有白矮星
Nothing to see here-- No black holes, no white dwarf stars,

650
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:50,182
没有中子星
no neutron stars.

651
00:40:50,516 --> 00:40:52,335
即使是质子也没有...
Not even any protons...

652
00:40:53,168 --> 00:40:54,766
什么都没有
Just nothing.

653
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:58,863
一个非常寒冷、非常黑暗的宇宙
In a very cold, dark universe,

654
00:40:59,071 --> 00:41:02,196
你会说，这会是终极的深冻
you could say that this will be the ultimate deep freeze.

655
00:41:04,238 --> 00:41:06,113
这是必然的吗？
Narrator: But does it have to be that way?

656
00:41:07,376 --> 00:41:09,988
有什么能让宇宙避免最终成为
Is there anything that could prevent our universe

657
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:12,890
一个冰冻、黑暗的虚空吗？
from ending up as a frozen, dark void?

658
00:41:14,043 --> 00:41:17,626
要避免宇宙的终极死亡
In order to prevent an ultimate death of the universe,

659
00:41:17,932 --> 00:41:21,932
重力--或者其它类似于重力的奇异力量
gravity-- or some attractive force like gravity

660
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:26,557
--必须把宇宙所有的子民拉扯回来
-- will have to pull back together all the constituents of the universe.

661
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,279
现在的宇宙正在扩张
Right now the universe is expanding.

662
00:41:29,293 --> 00:41:31,765
我们测量到的重力
And the force of gravity as we measure

663
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:34,348
并不足以把一切拉扯在一起
it isn't enough to pull everything together.

664
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:38,557
但要知道，我们还不能完全知道所有的作用力
But we recognize that we don't even know all the players at work.

665
00:41:38,584 --> 00:41:42,612
在过去的20年，我们才认识到暗能量
It's only been the last 20 years that we've even known that dark energy

666
00:41:43,112 --> 00:41:47,640
这是一种令人讨厌的力量，它会分散宇宙
-- which is a repulsive force in essence, something that pushes the universe apart

667
00:41:48,181 --> 00:41:51,737
--我们在20年之前甚至不知道它的存在
-- We didn't even know it existed more than about 20 years ago.

668
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,202
有可能在某一天
But it's conceivable that some day,

669
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:57,598
加速宇宙扩张的暗能量
the dark energy that's accelerating the expansion of the universe

670
00:41:58,056 --> 00:42:00,167
摇身变为重力一样的吸引力
will become gravitationally attractive.

671
00:42:00,945 --> 00:42:03,570
果真如此，而且它是足够的话
If that's the case, and if there's enough of it,

672
00:42:04,001 --> 00:42:08,112
宇宙或会停止它的扩张，再次坍塌
then the universe may halt its expansion and re-collapse.

673
00:42:08,306 --> 00:42:10,834
我们不知道这会否发生，但它可能会发生
We don't know that that will happen, but it might happen.

674
00:42:11,223 --> 00:42:16,403
在那种情况下，宇宙会经历一次非常高温的热死亡
In that case, the universe will experience a really hot heat-death,

675
00:42:16,556 --> 00:42:20,431
所有微粒会骤然进入到其它微粒里面
where all the particles are slamming into all the other particles.

676
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:21,848
温度很高
High temperatures.

677
00:42:21,903 --> 00:42:24,639
恒星走向毁灭，行星走向毁灭
Stars get destroyed, planets get destroyed.

678
00:42:24,764 --> 00:42:29,097
只剩下一个不同与往的、死气沉沉的宇宙...
You get a different form of a lifeless universe...

679
00:42:30,472 --> 00:42:34,056
一个以高温代替极冻的宇宙
One which is hot instead of in the deep freeze.

680
00:42:35,278 --> 00:42:38,250
但是，它不会形成“遮阳幕”
Narrator: Still, don't break out the sunscreen yet.

681
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:44,472
我敢打赌，宇宙会最终成为非常低温的极冻世界...
My bet is that the universe will end up in a very low temperature deep freeze...

682
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,208
因为目前的暗能量，看起来或许会
Because it seems that the current dark energy might be the type

683
00:42:48,472 --> 00:42:51,778
继续加速宇宙的扩张，永不停止
that will continue to accelerate the expansion forever.

684
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,027
假如果真如此，宇宙的温度
If that's the case, the temperature of the universe

685
00:42:55,111 --> 00:43:00,583
会反复接近绝对零度这一终极寒冷的温度
will become arbitrarily close to absolute zero-- The ultimate deep freeze.

686
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:06,014
寒冷是我们宇宙的一个决定性因素
Narrator: Cold is a critical ingredient of our universe.

687
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:11,902
它是我们所见到的宇宙的必要组成
Cold is essential to having the universe that we see.

688
00:43:12,249 --> 00:43:15,708
因为如果没有寒冷，能量就不会流动
Because without a cold spot, energy doesn't flow.

689
00:43:15,749 --> 00:43:18,680
你需要能量从热流向冷
You need energy to flow from hot to cold.

690
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,694
正是能量的流动
And it is the flow of energy that leads to

691
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:25,708
才形成现在的宇宙万物，包括我们人类本身
all the structures that we see in the universe, including ourselves.

692
00:43:26,235 --> 00:43:30,777
所以，如果没有能量通过各种可能方式
So we wouldn't be here if energy weren't trying to flow

693
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:34,221
竭力从热的地方流向宇宙各处
from hot concentrated organized places

694
00:43:34,263 --> 00:43:38,416
我们就不会在这里存在
into the many forms that it can flow into in the universe.

695
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:44,596
因此，日后感到冬日的寒冷或是被雪球打中的时候
So the next time you feel a winter chill or get hit with a snowball,

696
00:43:44,777 --> 00:43:48,818
你要记住--如果不是寒冷，你就不会在这里
just remember-- If it weren't for cold, you wouldn't be here.

697
00:43:49,082 --> 00:43:52,019
而且，如果算是一丝安慰的话
And if it's any consolation, you won't be around

698
00:43:52,707 --> 00:43:56,179
现在的你不用花上几百个数万亿年
hundreds of trillions of years from now when the universe

699
00:43:56,304 --> 00:43:59,999
去陪同宇宙迎接最后的极冻结局
enters its final state of deep freeze.

700
00:44:00,124 --> 00:44:01,832
