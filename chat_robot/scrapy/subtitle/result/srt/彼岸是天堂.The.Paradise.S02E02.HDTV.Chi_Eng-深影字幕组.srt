第二季 第二集

3
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:59,131
克莱曼斯! 很高兴再次见到你!
Clemence! What a delight it is to see you again!

4
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:03,131
亲爱的莫里 巴黎非常想念你
My darling Moray! Paris misses you so much.

5
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:07,131
没有你帅气的脸庞 乐篷马歇百货就是个惨淡之处
Le Bon Marche is a dismal place without your handsome face.

6
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:27,131
没人像你一样恭维我 小姐
No-one flatters me as you do, Mademoiselle.

7
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:30,131
亲爱的 我想要诱惑你
My darling, I intend to tempt you.

8
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:33,131
你会让我勾引你的 对吗?
You will let me seduce you, won't you?

9
00:01:33,131 --> 00:01:35,131
我有拒绝过你吗 克莱曼斯?
Did I ever deny you, Clemence?

10
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:37,131
她在跟他说什么?
What did she say to him?

11
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:42,131
- 不知道 - 不管是啥我都希望她是在对我说
- Don't know. - Whatever it was, I wish she was saying it to me!

12
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:49,131
失陪一下
Excuse me.

13
00:01:55,303 --> 00:01:58,303
迄今 谁能承受这样的奢侈无度?
Until now, who could afford such extravagance?

14
00:01:58,303 --> 00:02:00,303
唯有富人
Only the wealthy.

15
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:05,303
我总觉得乐趣都浪费在富人身上了 你不觉得吗?
I always feel that fun is wasted on the rich, don't you?

16
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:07,303
我希望有足够的欢乐充盈在我们的生活里
There's enough pleasures in life to go around, I hope.

17
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:09,303
我也希望
I hope so too.

18
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:18,303
我们找到了一种工艺手法使每个人都买得起
We have found a way to make my beautiful creations

19
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:20,303
我美丽的作品
so that anyone can afford them.

20
00:02:20,303 --> 00:02:22,303
你希望我们在天堂百货出售它们?
And you want us to offer them in The Paradise?

21
00:02:22,303 --> 00:02:24,303
你让我失望了 亲爱的!
Oh, you disappoint me, darling!

22
00:02:24,303 --> 00:02:28,303
那个在巴黎施展魔法的莫里到哪去了?
Where is the Moray who cast his spell over Paris?

23
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:30,303
不是出售它们 不 是推销它们
Not offer them, no. Sell them.

24
00:02:30,303 --> 00:02:32,303
大量卖出它们
Sell lots of them.

25
00:02:32,303 --> 00:02:35,303
克莱曼斯 如果你把烟花做得很便宜...
Clemence, if you make the fireworks cheaply...

26
00:02:35,303 --> 00:02:38,303
对不起 我们别再多费口舌了
Oh, please, let us not waste our lives talking.

27
00:02:38,303 --> 00:02:43,303
今晚 我会展示给你 亲爱的 我们要点亮天空 
I will show you. Tonight. Darling, we will light up the skies.

28
00:02:45,303 --> 00:02:47,303
他在他的信里提到过她吗?
So, did he write about her in his letters, then?

29
00:02:47,303 --> 00:02:50,303
没 没 他没有
No. No, he didn't.

30
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:55,303
我以为他会 如果我认识像她这样的人 我会
Well, you'd think he would. If I met someone like her, I would.

31
00:02:55,303 --> 00:03:00,303
那么 谁会接手奥德丽小姐的工作呢?
So, whose going to get Miss Audrey's job, then?

32
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:03,303
我还没走呢 梅尔托
I am not departed quite yet, Myrtle.

33
00:03:03,303 --> 00:03:06,303
我只是说说 奥德丽小姐 既然你要结婚
I'm only saying, Miss Audrey. Since you're to marry,

34
00:03:06,303 --> 00:03:09,303
他们会希望有人接手你的职位
they'll be wanting someone for your position.

35
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:12,303
我不得不说 这一切都太突然了
I have to say, it is all rather sudden.

36
00:03:12,303 --> 00:03:16,303
你可以不说 梅尔托 你不说没人当你是哑巴
You don't "have to say," Myrtle, you choose to say.

37
00:03:16,303 --> 00:03:18,303
我主张二十三年恋爱期
And I would contend that 23 years of courtship

38
00:03:18,303 --> 00:03:20,303
一定要有节有礼
has a certain decorum to it.

39
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:24,303
我不知道 二十三分钟的求爱我都觉得慢
I wouldn't know! Twenty-three minutes' wooing is slow for me!

40
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:29,303
我们都为您高兴 奥德丽小姐
We're very pleased for you, Miss Audrey.

41
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:32,303
你有婚礼要计划 还有蜜月
You'll have to plan the wedding. And the honeymoon.

42
00:03:32,303 --> 00:03:35,303
这些都要花时间 你不会马上结婚的
That all takes time. You're not getting married right away, like.

43
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:37,303
所以你暂时还不会离开
So, you're not leaving us just yet.

44
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:41,303
是啊 我们拭目以待
Yes. Well. We shall see.

45
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:44,303
如果我要结婚 我才不会有那种表情
If I was getting married, I wouldn't be wearing a face like that.

46
00:03:46,303 --> 00:03:49,303
确实让你起了好奇心了 不是吗?
Well, it does make you wonder, doesn't it?

47
00:03:49,303 --> 00:03:52,303
谁将是女装部的主管?
Who will be Head of Ladieswear?

48
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:23,303
夫人 请问... 你是在想.....
Ma'am, may I ask... were you thinking.....?

49
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:26,303
你会很快结婚吗?
Will you be marrying soon?

50
00:04:26,303 --> 00:04:30,303
我考虑了多少年啊?
How many years have I considered?

51
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,303
如果我结婚 我会失去我的工作
If I marry, I will lose my position.

52
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:35,303
如果我工作下去
If I hold on to my employment,

53
00:04:35,303 --> 00:04:37,303
我永远也不会知道婚姻的乐趣
I will never know the joys of marriage.

54
00:04:37,303 --> 00:04:41,303
我深思熟虑 反复思考 又被优柔寡断困住
I deliberate and ruminate and I'm frozen with indecision.

55
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:45,303
我唯一的办法就是冒险
So...the only way is for me to leap.

56
00:04:45,303 --> 00:04:46,303
冒险?
Leap?

57
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:50,303
如果我犹豫不决 我将独身而死 我有一些存款
If I dither, I will die a spinster. I have some savings.

58
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,303
我兄弟在海边留给我一间小屋
A cottage that my brother left to me by the sea.

59
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:57,303
我已经告诉莫里先生我要走了
I have told Mr Moray that I am leaving.

60
00:04:57,303 --> 00:05:00,303
结婚
Marrying.

61
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:04,303
离开
Leaving.

62
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:07,303
你好 小姐们
Bonjour, Mademoiselle.

63
00:05:11,303 --> 00:05:14,303
我非常喜欢长拖尾
Oh, I do so love the long trains.

64
00:05:14,303 --> 00:05:17,303
还有剪裁 它为什么能如此契合女人的身材!
And the cut, what it does for a woman's body!

65
00:05:17,303 --> 00:05:19,303
还有比这更有女人味的吗?
Is there anything more feminine?

66
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:20,303
告诉我你怎么看的 克莱拉
Tell me what you think, Clara.

67
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:24,303
百褶荷叶边的确显得轻柔 夫人
The pleated ruffles do give a soft influence, Ma'am.

68
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:27,303
哦 拜托 我知道你们英国人比较喜欢用尊称
Oh. Please. I know how you English do so prefer your deference,

69
00:05:27,303 --> 00:05:30,303
但你一定要叫我克莱曼斯
but you must call me Clemence.

70
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:32,136
蝴蝶结 扣子 还有穗带
Bows, buttons, and braids.

71
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:34,303
我们为什么那么喜欢它们?
Why do we love them so much?

72
00:05:34,303 --> 00:05:37,303
是因为它们使人眼前一亮吗?
Is it because they draw the eye?

73
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:41,303
我觉得我们的每个决定都是可控制的 不
I think that every decision we make is guided, no,

74
00:05:41,303 --> 00:05:43,303
由激情决定
determined by passion.

75
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:48,303
亦或是情欲 你们怎么看 姑娘们?
Sexual passion. What do you think, girls?

76
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:51,303
或许 夫人 我建议
Perhaps, Madam, I might suggest,

77
00:05:51,303 --> 00:05:55,303
试试用彩带丝绒帽作陪衬怎么样?
to accompany the silk velvet hat with the ribbon streamers?

78
00:05:58,303 --> 00:06:02,303
你当然是对的 因为你是一个了解自己行业的女人
Of course you are right, because you are a woman who knows her calling.

79
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:06,303
谢谢 女士 夫人 小姐
Thank you, Madam. Ma'am. Mademoiselle.

80
00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:07,303
克莱曼斯
Clemence.

81
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:10,303
这是我第一次来天堂百货
It is only my first visit to The Paradise

82
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:15,303
但 奥德丽小姐 我无法想象没有你在这里的场景
but, Miss Audrey, I cannot imagine this place without you.

83
00:06:18,303 --> 00:06:22,303
看到了吗 亚瑟? 加点焰火会发生什么?
See that, Arthur? Add a bit of a flame and what happens?

84
00:06:22,303 --> 00:06:25,303
物体开始旋转 四溅火花
Stuff starts spinning, sparks shooting

85
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:27,303
还会满天飞
and flying all over the place.

86
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,303
你会想到什么?
What does that remind you of?

87
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:31,303
一场暴风雨?
A thunderstorm?

88
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:34,303
女人 亚瑟 女人
Women, Arthur. Women.

89
00:06:34,303 --> 00:06:36,303
是啊 但这美丽又刺激
Yeah, but it's pretty and exciting.

90
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:43,303
亚瑟 我的小伙儿 你刚描述了男人永恒的困境
Arthur, me lad, you have just described man's eternal dilemma.

91
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:48,303
她非常美丽 不是吗 德妮丝?
She's so beautiful, in't she, Denise?

92
00:06:48,303 --> 00:06:50,303
我无法想象做那样的女人是什么感觉
I can't imagine what it must be like to be such a woman.

93
00:06:50,303 --> 00:06:53,303
你能想象吗 我打赌男人都会拜倒在她的石榴裙下
Can you? I bet men fall for her all the time.

94
00:06:53,303 --> 00:06:56,303
如果我是男人 我也会爱上她 你会吗 德妮丝?
If I was a man, I'd fall for her. Would you, Denise?

95
00:06:56,303 --> 00:06:58,303
我想我会抗拒
I think I could resist.

96
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,303
我从来没觉得法国人是那么的...法国风味儿
I never realised that French people were so... French.

97
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:05,303
我的意思是 所有那些抚摸啦 亲吻啦
I mean, all that touching'n kissing'n

98
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:08,303
调情啦
flirting.

99
00:07:21,303 --> 00:07:23,703
克莱曼斯 这是汤姆・威斯顿先生
Clemence, this is Mr Tom Weston.

100
00:07:23,704 --> 00:07:25,303
他是天堂百货的老板
He's the owner of The Paradise.

101
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:30,303
罗马尼斯小姐 我希望你能感觉到宾至如归
Mademoiselle Romanis. I hope you've been made welcome.

102
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,303
莫里总是非常慷慨
Moray is always most generous.

103
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:35,303
我不希望你觉得我们英国人像传说一样
I would not wish you to think that we English

104
00:07:35,303 --> 00:07:40,303
冷淡而且不好客
are as cold and inhospitable as our reputation.

105
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:44,303
你逗留的这段时间 或许我们可以一起吃顿饭?
Perhaps you might have dinner with me while you're here?

106
00:07:44,303 --> 00:07:48,303
我很荣幸 威斯顿先生
I would be delighted, Monsieur Weston.

107
00:07:48,303 --> 00:07:50,303
我不介乎你相信我们法国人
I would not care for you to believe we French

108
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,303
像耳闻那样的无礼
are as rude as our reputation.

109
00:07:54,303 --> 00:07:59,303
- 失陪一下 - 你要在英国待多久?
- Excuse me. - So, how long will you be staying?

110
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:10,303
我们的婚礼需要来点像烟花
Wouldn't it be something to have fireworks like that

111
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:12,303
这样的东西吗 奥德丽?
at our wedding, Audrey?

112
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:17,303
我们这年龄段? 这会显得轻率又没品位
At our age? It would be brash and tasteless.

113
00:08:17,303 --> 00:08:20,303
我们必须低调 艾德蒙!
We must reach for understatement, Edmund!

114
00:08:20,303 --> 00:08:23,303
我们这个年龄段 我的意思是我们需要庆祝
At our age, I say we should celebrate.

115
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,303
你似乎对她友好过头了 
You just seem awfully friendly with her, that's all.

116
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:28,303
我是对克莱曼斯非常友好
I am awfully friendly with Clemence.

117
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:36,303
你在巴黎时经常和她见面吗?
Did you see her when you were in Paris?

118
00:08:36,303 --> 00:08:38,303
三天两头见!
All the time!

119
00:08:38,303 --> 00:08:42,303
我是采购员 她是乐篷马歇百货最好的供货方
I was a buyer and she was the best supplier we had at Le Bon Marche.

120
00:08:42,303 --> 00:08:44,080
你和她一起吃过饭吗?
Did you dine with her?

121
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:46,303
有啊! 她是个极好的同伴
Yes! She's wonderful company.

122
00:08:49,303 --> 00:08:52,303
德妮丝 抱歉 但克莱曼斯不是我喜欢的类型
Denise. I'm sorry, but Clemence is not my type,

123
00:08:52,303 --> 00:08:57,303
我保证不管你看到了什么 我也不是她喜欢的类型
and I can assure you, despite what you see, I'm not her type either.

124
00:09:04,303 --> 00:09:06,303
你觉得 你会想念这里吗?
Will you miss the street, do you think?

125
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,303
我们可能永远不会离开!
We might never leave!

126
00:09:08,303 --> 00:09:12,303
我放了出售牌 看客比想买的人多
I put that sign up. Not had so much as a peep through the window.

127
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:17,303
在我兄弟去世之后 他的小屋就一直空着了
My brother's cottage is standing empty. It has been since he died.

128
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:22,303
我们这个周末去那整理一下 做好准备
We'll head up there at weekends, do some work, make it ready.

129
00:09:24,303 --> 00:09:27,303
我一直在琢磨...
I have been wondering...

130
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:29,303
...我们为什么要等呢?
..why must we wait?

131
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,303
告诉我关于威斯顿的事 他结婚了吗?
Tell me about Mr Weston. He is married?

132
00:09:42,303 --> 00:09:46,303
结了 他和凯瑟琳・格伦德宁结婚了
Oh, yes. He is married to Katherine Glendenning.

133
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:48,303
我听说过她
Oh, I have heard about her.

134
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:50,303
她是莫里去巴黎的原因
She is the reason Moray was in Paris.

135
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:53,303
她可不是个好惹的女人
She's not a woman to be crossed.

136
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:55,303
价格挺合理的
The price is good.

137
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:59,303
这周末烟火就能到我们店了
We can have the firecrackers in our store by the end of the week.

138
00:09:59,303 --> 00:10:02,303
我们不能让她相信我们已经做出决定了
We must not let her believe that we've made a decision yet.

139
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:04,303
先生 我已经向克莱曼斯提了...
Sir, I have already indicated to Clemence...

140
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,303
那你太草率了
Then you were too hasty.

141
00:10:06,303 --> 00:10:09,303
威斯顿先生 这个展示已经证明了她的产品有多好
Mr Weston, the display has proven how good her product is.

142
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:10,303
晚告诉她有什么好处?
What benefit is there in delay?

143
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,610
如果让她感觉到我们太积极
If she feels we're too keen,

144
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:15,303
这交易的主动权就到她手里了
then the deal will be made on her terms.

145
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:17,303
就让她噱我们好了
Let her woo us.

146
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:19,303
他们在讨论你
They're talking about you.

147
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:22,303
他们是男人 他们在谈论公事
They are men. They are talking about business.

148
00:10:22,303 --> 00:10:26,303
威斯顿先生正在告诉他们直到他带我去吃晚餐前
Mr Weston is telling them that they must not offer me the contract

149
00:10:26,303 --> 00:10:29,303
不要跟我签合约
until he has taken me out to dinner.

150
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:55,303
他死了吗?
Is he dead?

151
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:59,303
乔纳斯! 把他带进去
Jonas! Get him inside.

152
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:11,303
德妮丝 盛点热水来
Denise, fetch some hot water.

153
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,303
我们至少能把这可怜的家伙打理干净
Least we can do is clean the poor feller up.

154
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:15,303
所有不相干的人全给我出去
I want anybody who is not needed out of this room now.

155
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:18,303
包括老板 所有老板
Bosses included. Bosses most of all.

156
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,303
他发烧了
That's a fever if ever I saw one.

157
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,303
克莱拉 把他身上的脏衣服脱了
Clara, let's have these filthy clothes off him.

158
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:24,303
山姆 把你的睡衣拿来
Sam, fetch one of your nightgowns.

159
00:11:24,303 --> 00:11:26,303
我? 为什么一定要我的睡衣?
Me? Why does it have to be mine?

160
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:29,303
因为你有个好心肠 年轻的女士会因此爱你的
Because you're a kindly soul and the young women'll love you for it.

161
00:11:29,303 --> 00:11:32,303
我现在就去拿
I'll fetch it right away.

162
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:40,303
他为什么要回来?
Why has he come back?

163
00:11:40,303 --> 00:11:43,303
他会不会知道我回到天堂百货了?
D'you suppose he knows I have returned to The Paradise?

164
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:47,303
困扰我的是 为什么警察没有跟着他?
What has troubled me is - why did the constable not come after him?

165
00:11:47,303 --> 00:11:49,303
街上到处都是伯勒斯的死讯
The street was full of whispers about Burroughs' death

166
00:11:49,303 --> 00:11:52,303
还有乔纳斯脱罪出狱的消息
and Jonas walked away a free man.

167
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:54,303
我得感谢他出来了
I must be thankful that he did.

168
00:11:54,303 --> 00:11:58,303
把乔纳斯留在这对我们就意味着一件事--危险
Then having Jonas here can only mean one thing for us - danger.

169
00:11:58,303 --> 00:12:00,303
他病了! 我们得收留他
He's sick! We must give him shelter.

170
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:04,303
- 为什么? - 我们欠他的
- Why must we? - We owe Jonas that much.

171
00:12:04,303 --> 00:12:08,303
先等他好起来吧 然后再看看他想要什么
Just let him get well, then we'll see what he wants,

172
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:10,303
然后就赶他走
then we'll get rid of him.

173
00:12:10,303 --> 00:12:15,303
在...在小巷里...里...见
Me... meet me in.... in the alleyway...

174
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:21,303
八...八...八点
eight... eight... eight... eight o'clock.

175
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:26,303
告诉...告诉...告诉
Tell... tell.... tell...

176
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:29,303
- 他在说什么? - 他发着烧呢
What's he saying? - He is fevered.

177
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:32,303
他可能在说世界末日要到了
He could be saying the end of the world is nigh.

178
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:36,303
乔纳斯・弗兰克斯不发烧也会说这些东西
Jonas Franks doesn't need a fever to say the likes of that.

179
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:41,303
- 巴拉斯...巴拉斯 - 嘘...嘘
- Barrass... Baarrass.... - Shhh, shhh.

180
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,303
别说话
Don't talk.

181
00:12:43,303 --> 00:12:47,303
睡觉吧 你现在安全了
Sleep. You're going to be safe now.

182
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:57,303
我已经忘了我是来天堂百货做生意的
I might forget I have come to The Paradise to do business

183
00:12:57,303 --> 00:13:00,303
反而天天和闺蜜们在这儿
and spend all of my time here with girls

184
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:03,303
你的房间满是财宝
and your room full of treasures.

185
00:13:03,303 --> 00:13:08,303
你的愉快也是我们的愉快 克莱曼斯女士
We are pleased that you are pleased, Mademoiselle Clemence.

186
00:13:08,303 --> 00:13:12,303
原谅我 但我昨天偷听到段对话
Forgive me, but I overheard the conversation yesterday.

187
00:13:12,303 --> 00:13:14,303
你要离开了?
You are leaving?

188
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:17,303
嫁人? 约翰是疯了吧
To marry? Is John insane...

189
00:13:17,303 --> 00:13:19,303
错失了那么一个宝物?
..to lose such a diamond?

190
00:13:19,303 --> 00:13:22,303
当一个女人结婚时 她一定要放弃公事
When a woman marries, she must forfeit her office.

191
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,303
在面纱撩起之前 她已经走出办公门了
She's out of the door before the veil's pulled from her face.

192
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:28,303
但是也有结婚的男人依旧在这儿工作的
But there are men who work here who are married?

193
00:13:28,303 --> 00:13:31,303
达德利先生 男装部的克莱夫
Mr Dudley. Clive in Menswear.

194
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:34,303
男装部的艾伦 杂货商店的大卫
Alan in Menswear. David in Haberdashery...

195
00:13:34,303 --> 00:13:36,303
是的 谢谢你 克莱拉 一般的看门人都是已婚的
Yes, thank you, Clara. Half the porters are married.

196
00:13:36,303 --> 00:13:41,303
如果女人是想要生孩子的 可能我会理解
Perhaps I might understand if woman intends to have children,

197
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:43,303
但你不是这样的 不是吗 奥德丽?
but that is not so with you, is it, Audrey?

198
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:47,303
我解释过了 女士 就是这样的
As I have explained, Mademoiselle, it is the way.

199
00:13:47,303 --> 00:13:50,303
是啊 就是这样
Oh, yes! It is the way.

200
00:13:50,303 --> 00:13:54,303
就是这样让男人决定一切
It is the way the men have decided upon.

201
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,303
- 德妮丝 - 克莱曼斯女士
- Denise... Mademoiselle Clemence.

202
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,303
莫里的女人
Moray's girl.

203
00:14:00,303 --> 00:14:03,303
我现在知道为什么在巴黎时
I see now why he spoke of nothing but Denise, Denise, Denise

204
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:05,303
他嘴上老是挂着德妮丝 德妮丝 德妮丝了
all of the time in Paris.

205
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,303
我相信这不是真的 女士
I'm sure that's not true, Mademoiselle.

206
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:10,303
对女人只有一件事比
There is only one thing more heartbreaking for a woman

207
00:14:10,303 --> 00:14:13,303
和一个满怀欲望的男人吃饭更心碎
than a dinner with a man perspiring with lust,

208
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:18,303
那就是和一个渴望得到爱的男人共进晚餐
and that is dinner with a man pining for his love.

209
00:14:18,303 --> 00:14:23,303
但现在我看到你了 我能原谅他
But now that I see you, I can forgive him.

210
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:26,303
德妮丝 关于奥德丽小姐的困境 你怎么看?
What do you think of Miss Audrey's predicament, Denise?

211
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,303
我...
I...

212
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:32,303
我很高兴她想要结婚
..I'm pleased that she wishes to marry,

213
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:34,303
和她爱的人在一起
and to be with the man that she loves.

214
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:37,303
但这不是我问的问题
But that is not what I asked you.

215
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:41,303
一个女人的职位被剥夺
What do you think of a woman robbed of her position,

216
00:14:41,303 --> 00:14:44,303
一个有经验 各方面品质优秀的女人
a woman with experience, a woman brimming with best qualities,

217
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:49,303
因为我们身在男人的世界而被否决 你怎么看?
cast out because we live in a man's world?

218
00:14:49,303 --> 00:14:51,303
我认为这是错的
I think it's wrong.

219
00:14:51,303 --> 00:14:53,303
当然了
Course you do.

220
00:14:55,303 --> 00:14:59,303
你们女孩子晚上都在干嘛?
What do you girls do with yourself in the evenings?

221
00:14:59,303 --> 00:15:04,303
- 我会去对面街的酒屋 - 那今晚我们一起去
- I go to the inn across the street. - Ahhh, we will all go there tonight.

222
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:08,303
女士 那地方是昏暗的小地方
Mademoiselle, it's a murky little den of a place.

223
00:15:08,303 --> 00:15:11,303
我不确定你会不会喜欢
I'm not sure you'd find it to your tastes.

224
00:15:11,303 --> 00:15:16,303
我能借点纸吗? 我得写封信给威斯顿先生
Might I borrow some paper? I must write a note to Mr Weston

225
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:18,303
告诉他我今晚不能和他吃晚饭了
to tell him I cannot join him for dinner after all.

226
00:15:18,303 --> 00:15:20,303
今晚我很忙
I'm busy tonight.

227
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:23,303
奥德丽小姐 你一起来吗?
Miss Audrey, you will join us?

228
00:15:23,303 --> 00:15:25,303
小酒馆? 我从来没有...
The inn? I-I have never...

229
00:15:25,303 --> 00:15:28,303
我...我不赞同...
I... I would not countenance...

230
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,303
酒馆
the inn.

231
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,303
但你不好奇吗? 我很好奇诶 我已经邀请你了
But aren't you curious? I am. I have invited you.

232
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:36,303
你不会拒绝你法国来的客人吧 是吗?
You wouldn't offend your French guest by refusing, would you?

233
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:40,303
你为什么回来 乔纳斯?
Why have you come back, Jonas?

234
00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:43,303
我不是自己想过来的 先生
I did not come here at my own bidding, sir.

235
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:45,303
我是被带来的
I was brought here.

236
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:48,303
你不受欢迎 没人想你来
You're not welcome. You're not wanted.

237
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:54,303
我很多东西都看不透了 先生 但这个我看出来了
I don't see much clearly at the moment, sir, but I see that.

238
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:57,303
关于伯勒斯的死
The business with Burroughs' death -

239
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:59,303
为什么警察没有来抓你?
why did the constable not come after you?

240
00:15:59,303 --> 00:16:01,303
没什么神秘的 达德利先生
There is no mystery, Mr Dudley, sir.

241
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,303
我贿赂他了
I paid the man.

242
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:06,033
和这一带很多人一样
Like many people hereabouts,

243
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:09,303
他对布拉德利・伯勒斯也没什么好感
he had no regard for Bradley Burroughs.

244
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,303
你杀人了
You murdered a man.

245
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,303
如果你想象这种安排就能让你呆在这了
If you imagine that such an arrangement allows you to stay here,

246
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:15,303
那你就大错特错了
then you are mistaken.

247
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:21,303
麦片粥 这比把肉放在人上好多了
Porridge. It's better than meat for putting meat on a man.

248
00:16:22,303 --> 00:16:25,303
你一直爱你的麦片粥 乔纳斯先生
You always loved your porridge, Mr Jonas.

249
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:29,303
你怎么会落到这步田地?
How did you come to be in such a state?

250
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:33,303
我不知道
I don't know.

251
00:16:33,303 --> 00:16:35,303
你怎么会在那马车上的?
How did you come to be on that wagon?

252
00:16:37,303 --> 00:16:39,303
我不知道
I don't know.

253
00:16:39,303 --> 00:16:41,303
你不知道的有点多啊
You don't know a lot, do you?

254
00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:44,303
高烧榨干了你的活力
The fever has drained the life out of you.

255
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,303
等到你能走路了 你就可以走了
When you're well enough to walk, you'll be on your way.

256
00:16:48,303 --> 00:16:50,303
我想你可以安排个烟火的展示
..so I thought you could put on a display of the fireworks,

257
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:53,303
邀请各种各样的人 然后在街上摆一个摊头
invite all kinds of people and set up a stall on the street

258
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,303
卖烟火
to sell the firecrackers.

259
00:16:54,303 --> 00:16:56,303
现在你喜欢克莱曼斯了?
So you like Clemence now?

260
00:16:56,303 --> 00:16:57,303
我应该无视这个
I shall ignore that.

261
00:16:57,303 --> 00:17:00,303
这是个很棒的点子 我很高兴我想到了它
It's a marvellous idea. I'm glad I thought of it.

262
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:05,303
我眼里容不下别的女人 德妮丝 她们都不存在
I have no eyes for other women, Denise. They do not exist.

263
00:17:05,303 --> 00:17:07,303
我已经找到我要娶的女人了
I have found the woman I will marry.

264
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:16,303
我好高兴 亲爱的
I am so glad, my darling,

265
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:19,303
你已经着手天堂百货的事务了
you have readily taken to the business of The Paradise.

266
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:23,303
但我得承认 我没想到你会天天去那里
But I must confess, I didn't imagine you would go in there every day.

267
00:17:25,303 --> 00:17:29,303
莫里找了个法国女人供烟花给他
Moray has a French woman supplying him with fireworks.

268
00:17:29,303 --> 00:17:32,303
我得确保他不会被骗做亏本买卖
I want to make sure he isn't beguiled into a bad deal.

269
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,303
烟花! 爸爸 我能不能去看看?
Firecrackers! Can I see them, Daddy?

270
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:37,303
她是个法国人?
So she's French?

271
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:38,303
对啊
Yes.

272
00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:42,303
今天我会和她共进晚餐
I'm having dinner with her tonight.

273
00:17:42,303 --> 00:17:47,303
我很高兴你能发现天堂百货的迷人之处 亲爱的
Well, I am glad you find The Paradise so engaging...darling.

274
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:52,303
女装部的主管要离职了
The head of Ladieswear is leaving.

275
00:17:53,303 --> 00:17:55,303
奥德丽小姐?
Miss Audrey?

276
00:17:55,303 --> 00:17:57,303
对 她要结婚了
Yeah. She is to marry.

277
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:02,303
所以说有女店员要晋升了?
So one of the girls will be promoted?

278
00:18:02,303 --> 00:18:03,303
有什么关系么?
Does it matter?

279
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,303
我意识到 只要我还是为男人工作
I realised that so long as I worked for a man

280
00:18:18,303 --> 00:18:20,303
我就永远都只是一个...
I would never be more than a...

281
00:18:20,303 --> 00:18:21,303
所有物? 你们的说法是什么?
saisine. What do you say?

282
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:23,303
奴隶?
A chattel?

283
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,303
奴隶
A chattel.

284
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,803
我审视这些男人然后问我自己
I looked at the men and I asked myself,

285
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,303
我能否做到他们做的这些?
can I do what they do?

286
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:28,303
答案是肯定的
And the answer was yes.

287
00:18:28,303 --> 00:18:30,303
答案是我可以比他们做得更好
The answer was I can do it better than they do.

288
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:32,303
所以你就开始自己做生意了?
So you started your own business?

289
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:35,303
我了解了人们想要买什么东西
I have an idea of something people might like to buy,

290
00:18:35,303 --> 00:18:37,303
我找到了能帮我达成目标的人
I find someone who can make it for me,

291
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:40,303
我给乐蓬马歇百货或者其他商店供货
I supply to Le Bon Marche or any other store.

292
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:43,303
- 我活得很滋润 - 我只庆幸我有份工作
- I live a good life. - I'm just happy to have a job.

293
00:18:43,303 --> 00:18:46,303
这种事情在法国很常见 小姐
That is all very well in France, Mademoiselle.

294
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:49,303
在英国 我们更倾向于遵守我们的传统
In England, we prefer to cling on to our civilisation.

295
00:18:49,303 --> 00:18:52,303
传统能让你感到满足吗?
Does this civilisation make you feel contented?

296
00:18:53,303 --> 00:18:57,303
天啊! 这是后宫还是妇女会什么的吗?
Good Lord! Is it a harem or a hen party?

297
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,303
你也可以参加啊 山姆 你基本就是个女人嘛
You can join us, Sam. You're as good as one of the girls.

298
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:03,303
嘿! 我不是女人 请您不要乱说
Hey! I am not one of the girls, if you don't mind.

299
00:19:03,303 --> 00:19:06,303
有那么一两个姑娘可以证明
There's one or two lass can prove it.

300
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:08,303
我去吧台喝一杯
I'll have a drink at the bar.

301
00:19:08,303 --> 00:19:11,303
来 大家把酒杯举起来 所有人 稍等
Please, lift up your glass, all of you. Now wait.

302
00:19:12,303 --> 00:19:15,303
生活是一种激情 对不对?
Life is passion. Isn't that true?

303
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:18,303
什么比女人还要更有激情呢?
What is more passionate than a woman?

304
00:19:18,303 --> 00:19:21,303
要是一个女人决定了她的目标
If a woman can be what she decides to be,

305
00:19:21,303 --> 00:19:24,303
要是一个女人可以遵从她内心的召唤
if a woman can love and follow her own calling,

306
00:19:24,303 --> 00:19:27,303
那她就可以把握她自己的人生
then she can determine her own life.

307
00:19:27,303 --> 00:19:29,303
我提议 为女人的激情干杯
I ask you to drink to woman's passion.

308
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:31,303
谁和我一起?
Who will drink with me?

309
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:48,303
我从来不会和任何人这样说话
I've never talked this way with anyone before.

310
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:50,303
我觉得我有点喝醉了
I feel as though I'm a bit drunk.

311
00:19:50,303 --> 00:19:52,303
我猜我有点儿醉了! 
Well, I AM a bit drunk, I suppose!

312
00:19:53,303 --> 00:19:55,303
我从来没有见过像您这样的人 克莱曼斯
Never met anyone like you, Clemence.

313
00:19:55,303 --> 00:19:58,303
不久 世上像我这样的女人会越来越多
The world will soon be filled with women like me.

314
00:19:58,303 --> 00:19:59,303
你怎么选择呢 德妮丝?
But what about you, Denise?

315
00:19:59,303 --> 00:20:03,303
除了售货员和妻子 你能做到更多的事情
There is too much about you to be a shop girl or a wife.

316
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,303
你想做什么呢?
What do you want to be?

317
00:20:06,303 --> 00:20:08,303
是什么呢?
Qui est-il?

318
00:20:09,303 --> 00:20:10,303
我...
I...

319
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:14,303
我想成为莫里
I want to be Moray.

320
00:20:14,303 --> 00:20:18,303
我是说... 我不是想成为一个男人
I mean...I don't want to be a man.

321
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,303
我梦想能经营天堂百货
I dream of running The Paradise.

322
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:25,303
并不只是因为商店本身的魅力
Not just for the glamour of it,

323
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:29,303
尽管我很喜欢听到摩挲那些华美礼服时发出的声音
although I do like the idea of swishing around in a fine dress.

324
00:20:29,303 --> 00:20:33,303
我是说工作本身 我喜欢这份工作
For the work. That is what I love.

325
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:36,303
当我有个想法 或者做出决定的时候
When I have an idea or make a decision

326
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:39,303
或者我有机会带头做些事情的时候 我感到...
or someone gives me the opportunity to take the lead, I feel...

327
00:20:41,303 --> 00:20:43,303
我很难描述那种感觉
I can't quite describe it.

328
00:20:46,303 --> 00:20:48,303
我会做很多事情 如果有机会...
There are so many things I would do if...

329
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:54,303
当我们直面我们的激情时 我们就自由了
When we admit to our passion, we are free.

330
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:59,303
我们就能得到想要的 成为我们想成为的人
We can have what we want, be who we want to be.

331
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,303
我就知道 你和我的想法一样
I knew you'd see things the same as I do.

332
00:21:04,303 --> 00:21:05,303
对吗?
Is it true?

333
00:21:05,303 --> 00:21:07,303
是的
It is true.

334
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:13,303
你真漂亮
You're so beautiful.

335
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:14,303
不行
No.

336
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:18,303
没有人会知道的 我们想做什么就做什么
No-one will know. We can have whatever we want.

337
00:21:18,303 --> 00:21:20,303
可我知道啊
I'LL know.

338
00:21:20,303 --> 00:21:22,303
这不是我想要的
I don't want this.

339
00:21:29,303 --> 00:21:31,303
您可以听听我的建议 先生
Perhaps I could suggest, sir,

340
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:33,303
我们根据她的大概定价做出决定
we make a decision based on the prices she has outlined

341
00:21:33,303 --> 00:21:35,303
- 就能确保正常供应了 - 不 我们先不提
- and the guarantee of a regular supply. - No. We wait.

342
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:39,303
要是她回巴黎了 没有在餐桌上和您定下协定呢?
What if she returns to Paris and there's been no dinner engagement?

343
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:40,303
哦 她会和我共进晚餐的
Oh, she will dine with me.

344
00:21:40,303 --> 00:21:44,303
威斯顿先生 我了解克莱曼斯 她很轻浮
Mr Weston, I know Clemence. She is flighty.

345
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,303
当男人关心她的时候 她会挑逗戏耍他们
Where men are concerned, she likes to tease and play.

346
00:21:48,303 --> 00:21:53,303
我了解克莱曼斯这样的女人 她们就是该被驯服的
I know women like Clemence. What they respond to is being mastered.

347
00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:55,303
为什么因为她是个女人就要特殊考虑?
Why does it matter that she is a woman?

348
00:21:55,303 --> 00:21:56,303
我们必须要考虑的是这宗交易
We must consider this business.

349
00:21:56,303 --> 00:21:58,303
我们应该像对待其他供应商一样对她
We treat her as we do any other supplier.

350
00:21:58,303 --> 00:22:02,303
我们都是男人 你懂我的意思
We are all gentlemen together. You know what I intend.

351
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:04,303
她令人难以抗拒 我为什么要抗拒?
I find her irresistible. Why should I resist?

352
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:08,080
威斯顿先生 克莱曼斯她可不会...
Mr Weston, Clemence does not...

353
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:10,303
对追求者有什么回应
respond to gentlemen suitors.

354
00:22:10,303 --> 00:22:13,303
你是说她是一个贞洁的法国淑女?
You're telling me she's a chaste French maid?!

355
00:22:13,303 --> 00:22:14,303
她更喜欢扮演一个诱惑者
She prefers the role of seducer.

356
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:18,303
你认为我没有办法破解她的防备?
You think I can't overcome her resistance?

357
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,303
我希望您别去尝试
I would prefer you did not try.

358
00:22:22,303 --> 00:22:26,303
你试过了 是不是? 在巴黎的时候
You tried, didn't you? In Paris.

359
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,303
然后她拒绝了你
And she rejected you.

360
00:22:32,303 --> 00:22:34,303
"我们都是男人"
"We're all gentlemen together."

361
00:22:34,303 --> 00:22:37,303
我觉得我被迫加入了一个俱乐部
I feel I've been pressed into a club I have no wish to join.

362
00:22:37,303 --> 00:22:40,303
要是他认为没必要在我们面前掩饰他的意图...
If he sees no reason to hide his intentions from us...

363
00:22:40,303 --> 00:22:43,303
你是个专家 我是指 你在一群法国人中间生活过
You're the expert. I mean, you've lived amongst the French.

364
00:22:43,303 --> 00:22:46,303
- 我们怎么处理这事儿? - 我们不插手
- How do we deal with this? - We don't.

365
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:48,303
她会处理好的
She does.

366
00:22:48,303 --> 00:22:51,303
要是你...玩弄他的话 他就会和你对着干
If you...toy with him, he will set himself against you

367
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,303
我可不能保证你签下合同
and I cannot guarantee you will get the contract.

368
00:22:53,303 --> 00:22:56,303
好吧 那你要我怎么做 亲爱的? 向他妥协?
Well, what would you have me do, darling? Submit to him?

369
00:22:56,303 --> 00:22:58,303
躲起来? 逃走?
Hide away? Run away?

370
00:22:58,303 --> 00:22:59,868
我提醒你 克莱曼斯
I warn you, Clemence,

371
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:02,303
汤姆・威斯顿是个复杂的男人
Tom Weston is made of a different mettle.

372
00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:04,303
我不认为他可以欺凌我
I see no reason to let him bully me

373
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:07,303
因为他就是一个专横的被惯坏了的英国男人
because he's a spoiled Englishman used to having his own way.

374
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,560
你怎么想 德妮丝?
Do you, Denise?

375
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:11,303
- 您是否需要我回避一下 莫里先生 - 不用
- Do you want me to leave so you can talk, Mr Moray? - No.

376
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:13,303
不 不需要的 德妮丝
No, there's no need for that, Denise.

377
00:23:14,303 --> 00:23:17,303
你是否想和他打交道?
Do you intend to take him on?

378
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:19,610
我喜欢像汤姆・威斯顿这样的男人
Well, I like men like Tom Weston

379
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:21,303
就是因为他们太好懂了
because it is so easy to know them.

380
00:23:21,303 --> 00:23:24,303
这样的男人 要驯服他们易如反掌
Such men, it's a child's play to tame them.

381
00:23:26,303 --> 00:23:29,303
呃 德妮丝 能否给我张纸?
Er, Denise, might I borrow some paper?

382
00:23:30,303 --> 00:23:32,303
我会写张条儿给汤姆・威斯顿
I'm going to write to Mr Tom Weston

383
00:23:32,303 --> 00:23:36,303
就告诉他我没有办法和他共进晚餐了
to tell him I cannot meet him for a dinner tonight.

384
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:08,303
女士 真是对不起 我拿错鞋子了
Ma'am, I'm so sorry, I've got the wrong pair.

385
00:24:08,303 --> 00:24:10,303
我去给您取另外一双过来
I'll fetch the correct ones for you.

386
00:24:12,303 --> 00:24:15,303
克莱拉 克莱曼斯小姐吻了我
Clara, Mademoiselle Clemence kissed me.

387
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:18,303
她吻你了?
She kissed you?

388
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:20,303
她想要引诱我
She wanted to seduce me.

389
00:24:20,303 --> 00:24:24,303
但她是莫里的朋友 你有没有告诉他?
But she's Moray's friend. Have you told him?

390
00:24:24,303 --> 00:24:26,303
- 我本该说的 - 那为什么不说?
- I should. - Then why don't you?

391
00:24:26,303 --> 00:24:27,191
我不知道
I don't know.

392
00:24:27,192 --> 00:24:30,303
如果她是个男人 你就会告诉他 对吧?
If she was a man you'd tell him, wouldn't you?

393
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:34,303
我希望她签下合同 我很烦恼
I want her to have the contract. I'm confused.

394
00:24:34,303 --> 00:24:36,303
她说的那些 关于女人内心的欲求
Everything she said, about women having a calling

395
00:24:36,303 --> 00:24:39,303
我们不应该这样带着...
and the wrongs that we live with...

396
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:40,303
姑娘们!
Girls!

397
00:24:42,303 --> 00:24:44,303
姑娘们 我还没离职呢
Girls, I am not quite deposed yet.

398
00:24:44,303 --> 00:24:46,303
我希望你们还能对我有点尊重
I hope you will show me the respect of my position

399
00:24:46,303 --> 00:24:49,303
请保持到我从商店离开
until such a time as I am escorted from the premises.

400
00:24:49,303 --> 00:24:52,303
克莱拉 现在没有人服侍巴顿女士
Clara, Mrs Barton is without attendance.

401
00:24:54,303 --> 00:24:57,303
还有三周 那时我们可以...
It's only three Sundays, and then we can...

402
00:24:57,303 --> 00:25:00,303
没必要去管那个木屋的情况
It doesn't matter what condition the cottage is in,

403
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:01,303
只要能够保暖就行
so long as we're warm.

404
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:06,303
莫里先生将要安排面试
Mr Moray is to conduct interviews.

405
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:09,303
为了我的职位
For my position.

406
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:10,303
那很重要
Well, that's grand.

407
00:25:10,303 --> 00:25:14,303
给年轻女孩一些机会展示自己的能力
Give the younger girls a chance to stake a claim.

408
00:25:14,303 --> 00:25:16,303
我们的德妮丝会很期望这事的
Our Denise'll be keen, I expect.

409
00:25:16,303 --> 00:25:18,303
我没那么老
I am not so old.

410
00:25:20,303 --> 00:25:22,303
还不是很老
Not so very old.

411
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:25,303
你自己说的 奥德丽 "在我们这个年龄"
You said it yourself, Audrey - "At our age".

412
00:25:25,303 --> 00:25:28,303
我那时指的是烟火
I was referring to the firecrackers.

413
00:25:28,303 --> 00:25:30,303
我没去工作还不到一天
There has not been one day when I have been absent from my work.

414
00:25:30,303 --> 00:25:33,303
是的 不到一天你就失去话语权了
Yes, there has. That time you lost your voice.

415
00:25:33,303 --> 00:25:35,303
我说的不是指几个男人
What I meant was no more than any man.

416
00:25:36,303 --> 00:25:38,303
我们被男人统治了
We are ruled by men.

417
00:25:46,303 --> 00:25:51,303
我们将会住在你哥哥的小屋 这是你的决定
We are going to live in your brother's cottage. Your decision.

418
00:25:52,303 --> 00:25:56,303
为了跟你结婚我等了好多年 是你的决定
I've waited years to marry you. Your decision.

419
00:25:56,303 --> 00:26:00,303
现在我们要急急忙忙地结婚了 也是你的决定
Now we are to marry in haste. Your decision.

420
00:26:00,303 --> 00:26:03,303
如果女人就是这样被男人统治的 那我就太差劲了
If that is a woman ruled by men, then I'm a pincushion.

421
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:08,303
这些都是小事 我讲的是根本
Those are trifles. I am talking about fundamentals,

422
00:26:08,303 --> 00:26:09,932
一个女人内心的呼唤
a woman's calling.

423
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:12,303
对我而言这不是小事 奥德丽
They are not trifles to me, Audrey.

424
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:14,303
如果你要求的话我会立即卖掉我的商店
I put my shop up for sale on your say-so.

425
00:26:14,303 --> 00:26:17,303
你这么说是要改变主意了吗?
Are you telling me you want to change your mind?

426
00:26:21,303 --> 00:26:24,303
我认为克莱曼斯小姐...
I think Mademoiselle Clemence...

427
00:26:26,303 --> 00:26:28,303
并不关心男人
..does not care for men.

428
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:32,303
一点也不关心 她更喜欢折磨我们
Far from it. She likes nothing better than to bait us.

429
00:26:32,303 --> 00:26:34,303
我的意思是...
What I meant was...

430
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,303
我认为她更喜欢女人
..I think she prefers women.

431
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:45,303
你为什么不告诉我?
Why didn't you tell me?

432
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,303
什么?
What?

433
00:26:46,303 --> 00:26:50,303
你认为我会因为你嫉妒她就告诉你吗?
You think I should have told you because you were jealous of her?

434
00:26:50,303 --> 00:26:52,303
好让你放松一下吗?
To put you at your ease?

435
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:56,303
讲她的私事不是我应该做的 德妮丝
It is not my place to tell her private business, Denise.

436
00:27:00,303 --> 00:27:02,303
还没有买家吗 洛维特先生?
No buyers yet, Mr Lovett?

437
00:27:04,303 --> 00:27:07,303
我不知道我还要不要卖这个店 山姆
I don't even know if I'm still selling up, Sam.

438
00:27:07,303 --> 00:27:08,303
为什么? 发生什么事了?
Why? What's happened?

439
00:27:08,303 --> 00:27:11,303
奥德丽似乎突然间认为
Audrey seems to suddenly believe that to marry

440
00:27:11,303 --> 00:27:13,303
结婚是对女性的背叛
would be a betrayal of her sex.

441
00:27:13,303 --> 00:27:17,303
那一定是小姐搞的鬼 我听到了她们在酒吧的谈话
That'll be Mademoiselle's doing. I heard 'em all talking in the inn.

442
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:20,303
- 奥德丽去过"三皇冠"? 不可能 - 是的
- Audrey in the Three Crowns? No. - Yes.

443
00:27:20,303 --> 00:27:22,303
我都没去过那里
I don't even go in there.

444
00:27:22,303 --> 00:27:26,303
- 那真像个聚会 - 我还在这里吃不好睡不好
- Oh, it was quite the party. - And here's me without a breath of sleep

445
00:27:26,303 --> 00:27:29,303
担心我是不是还能结婚?
fretting about whether my marriage is on or off?

446
00:27:29,303 --> 00:27:32,303
我对女人的认识就是 你要承诺你会永远爱她们
What I know about women is this - you promise them undying love,

447
00:27:32,303 --> 00:27:33,303
婚姻与忠诚 
marriage, faithfulness,

448
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:35,303
两者是不可分割的
they're away in a wisp.

449
00:27:35,303 --> 00:27:37,303
如果你不在乎 就去那里看看吧
If you don't give a hoot, act the lad about town,

450
00:27:37,303 --> 00:27:39,303
在那里你就是王子
chase you around like a prince.

451
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:42,303
好吧 我们今晚去旅馆 山姆
Right. We're going to the inn tonight, Sam.

452
00:27:42,303 --> 00:27:45,303
- 我身无分文 - 我买单 把那些东西拿进来
- Haven't got a penny in my pocket. - I'm buying. Bring that lot in.

453
00:27:45,303 --> 00:27:47,303
我们必须把最小的烟火放在前面
We must put the smallest firecrackers in the front,

454
00:27:47,303 --> 00:27:51,303
一次只卖一个 那样人们才买得起
sell them one at a time so people can afford them.

455
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:56,303
我必须提醒你 小姐 合约毫无疑问是确定的
I must remind you, Mademoiselle, the contract is by no means certain.

456
00:27:56,303 --> 00:27:59,303
但是我无条件相信莫里
Oh, but I have every faith in Moray.

457
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:01,303
那两蠢货还在装模作样
The two bulls are butting heads.

458
00:28:01,303 --> 00:28:05,303
为什么男人认为装腔作势能吸引女人呢?
Why do men suppose that posturing is what catches a woman's eye?

459
00:28:05,303 --> 00:28:08,303
吸引人的男人总是缄默的 像你这样的
The handsomest man is always the most reserved. Like you.

460
00:28:10,303 --> 00:28:12,303
你说这话真是太奉承了 小姐
This is very flattering of you, Mademoiselle.

461
00:28:12,303 --> 00:28:16,303
那不是奉承 别侮辱我 那是事实
It is not flattery. On m'a offense. It is the truth.

462
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:18,303
你最可爱的地方
The loveliest thing about you

463
00:28:18,303 --> 00:28:20,303
就是你不知道你有多么美好
is that you have no idea of how beautiful you are.

464
00:28:21,303 --> 00:28:24,303
原谅我吧 罗马尼斯小姐
Forgive me, Mademoiselle Romanis,

465
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:29,303
我不习惯女人这么开放 这么恭维
but I'm not used to women being quite so forward, so complimenting.

466
00:28:30,303 --> 00:28:33,303
如果你请我共进晚餐 我不会拒绝的
If you were to ask me to a dinner, I would not refuse.

467
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:35,303
我是个有妇之夫
I am a married man.

468
00:28:35,303 --> 00:28:37,303
我知道
I know that.

469
00:28:37,303 --> 00:28:40,303
我认为与这样一个有魅力的女人共进晚餐是...
I would consider it improper to have dinner with such a...

470
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,303
不合适的
..an attractive woman.

471
00:28:43,303 --> 00:28:44,303
没人会知道的
No-one would know.

472
00:28:46,303 --> 00:28:48,303
你是在取笑我吗?
Are you making fun of me?

473
00:28:48,303 --> 00:28:51,303
你没看到我看你的眼神吗?
Have you not seen the way I look at you?

474
00:28:51,303 --> 00:28:53,303
我深深的被你吸引了
I am deeply attracted to you.

475
00:28:54,303 --> 00:28:56,303
- 我决不能 - 我也看到了你看我的眼神
- I could never... - I also see the way you look at me.

476
00:28:56,303 --> 00:28:59,303
是不确定吗?
Is it not true?

477
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:01,303
你是个非常美丽的女人
You are a very beautiful woman.

478
00:29:04,303 --> 00:29:08,303
今晚当你躺下的时候 我会醒着
When your head lies on your pillow tonight, I'll be lying awake,

479
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:09,303
幻想你跟我在一起
wishing you were with me.

480
00:30:11,303 --> 00:30:12,303
乔纳斯!
Jonas!

481
00:30:18,303 --> 00:30:22,303
我应该知道 他是个男人 我应该警告他
I should've known - he's a man. I should've warned him

482
00:30:22,303 --> 00:30:25,303
提醒他起床什么的 那样也许他就会躺在床上了
to get up and about, and then he might've stayed in bed.

483
00:30:25,303 --> 00:30:28,303
你在外面做什么 乔纳斯?
What were you doing out there, Jonas?

484
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:32,303
我不记得啦
I don't remember.

485
00:30:32,303 --> 00:30:35,011
我不记得我什么时候起床
I don't recall getting from my bed.

486
00:30:35,012 --> 00:30:37,303
情况不妙 是吗?
That's not good, is it?

487
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:41,303
很糟糕 我想说
That's bad, I'd say.

488
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:49,303
达德利 你在这儿工作多久了?
Dudley. How long have you worked here?

489
00:30:51,303 --> 00:30:54,303
莫里和我很小就来了 那时这里属于埃默森先生
Moray and I came here as boys, when Mr Emmerson owned the place.

490
00:30:54,303 --> 00:30:56,303
那时还是小规模的交易
It was a great deal smaller then.

491
00:30:56,303 --> 00:31:01,303
很感人... 想到两个穷小子
It is...touching, to think that two poor boys

492
00:31:02,303 --> 00:31:05,303
成长到现在的地位
have risen to such status.

493
00:31:05,303 --> 00:31:08,303
帅气的西装 丝质的领带...
Fine suits, silk ties...

494
00:31:08,303 --> 00:31:11,303
你一定不会想到会有这么大的区别吧
You must not let such distinction go to your head.

495
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:15,303
我自己一直很感激我能有这些责任
I've always considered myself grateful for the responsibilities.

496
00:31:15,303 --> 00:31:19,303
那你就别再跟罗马尼斯小姐纠缠不清了
Then you will have no more to do with Mademoiselle Romanis.

497
00:31:19,303 --> 00:31:20,303
先生 我向你保证...
Sir, I assure you...

498
00:31:20,303 --> 00:31:22,303
别否认我亲眼看到的事实
Do not contradict what my eyes have witnessed.

499
00:31:22,303 --> 00:31:25,303
威斯顿先生 克莱曼斯告诉我的就是...
Mr Weston, sir, what I know of Clemence tells me...

500
00:31:25,303 --> 00:31:27,303
我允许你说话了吗 莫里?
Did I ask for your intervention, Moray?

501
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:30,303
似乎每一天我都必须向你说明
It seems that with each passing day I must continue to convey

502
00:31:30,303 --> 00:31:32,303
世界已经改变了
to you that the world has changed.

503
00:31:32,303 --> 00:31:35,303
天堂百货不再属于你了
The Paradise is no longer your domain.

504
00:31:35,303 --> 00:31:40,303
这里的生意将由我管理
Business here will be conducted at my bidding.

505
00:31:40,303 --> 00:31:42,303
如果你想保留你在这里的位置 达德利
If you wish to retain your position here, Dudley,

506
00:31:42,303 --> 00:31:45,303
你就别管克莱曼斯了 你明白吗?
you will leave Clemence be. Do you understand?

507
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:49,303
- 是的 先生 - 那就没什么事了
- Yes, sir. - Then all is well with the world.

508
00:31:57,303 --> 00:31:59,303
我已经尽我所能容忍你的丈夫了
I have done my best to tolerate your husband

509
00:31:59,303 --> 00:32:02,303
但是他威胁要解雇达德利
but he has threatened to dismiss Dudley.

510
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:05,303
我不会允许他那么做的
I will not allow him to do this.

511
00:32:06,303 --> 00:32:09,303
你为什么把我叫到这里呢?
Why have you called me back here?

512
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:12,303
是为了恢复天堂百货吗? 那是不可能的
Is it to restore The Paradise? Because that is impossible

513
00:32:12,303 --> 00:32:16,303
因为我一定要对付这种报复性的干涉
if I must contend with this kind of vindictive interference.

514
00:32:16,303 --> 00:32:20,303
为什么汤姆想要除掉达德利呢?
Why would Tom wish to remove Dudley?

515
00:32:20,303 --> 00:32:23,303
他似乎把达德利看成是竞争对手
He seems to consider Dudley as some kind of rival.

516
00:32:26,303 --> 00:32:28,673
罗马尼斯小姐吗?
Ahh, Mademoiselle Romanis?

517
00:32:28,674 --> 00:32:33,674
那就是你来这里的原因吗? 来刺激我?
Is that why you are here? To goad me?

518
00:32:34,303 --> 00:32:38,303
我来这里是因为我觉得我必须来 凯瑟琳...
I-I came here because I felt I had to. Katherine...

519
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:42,303
我不需要你的可怜 我不会跟我丈夫分开的
I do not want your pity. I will make my own accommodation with my husband.

520
00:32:47,303 --> 00:32:49,303
汤姆并不是他表现出来的那样
Tom is not what he appears to be to some people.

521
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:54,303
他是一个好丈夫 好父亲 军人都有一点...
He is a fine husband, and father. Military men are somet...

522
00:32:57,303 --> 00:33:02,303
我来处理这事 谢谢 凯瑟琳 如果有需要我的
I will deal with this. Well, thank you, Katherine. If I can help...

523
00:33:02,303 --> 00:33:05,303
你什么时候任命一个新的女装部主管?
When will you appoint a new Head of Ladieswear?

524
00:33:05,303 --> 00:33:09,303
- 我们将进行面试 - 德妮丝是个绝佳的人选
- We will conduct interviews. - Denise will make an excellent appointment.

525
00:33:11,303 --> 00:33:13,303
很显然她是最好的候选人
She is clearly the best candidate.

526
00:33:13,303 --> 00:33:15,303
我们还要考虑其他的女孩
There...there are other girls we must consider.

527
00:33:15,303 --> 00:33:17,096
克莱拉也很有能力...
Clara has qualities which...

528
00:33:17,097 --> 00:33:19,303
你为什么不愿意选德妮丝呢?
Why would you hold Denise back?

529
00:33:19,303 --> 00:33:21,303
有点说不过去
It makes no sense.

530
00:33:22,303 --> 00:33:24,911
你考虑过其他人会怎么想吗?
Are you concerned what others will think

531
00:33:24,912 --> 00:33:27,303
如果你支持你的情人?
if you favour your lover?

532
00:33:27,303 --> 00:33:30,303
支不支持德妮丝跟你又有什么关系呢?
Why would it matter to you to champion Denise?

533
00:33:30,303 --> 00:33:33,303
或许我应该感谢公平的价值
Perhaps I have come to appreciate the value of justice.

534
00:34:03,303 --> 00:34:08,303
克莱曼斯小姐 我必须恳求你
Mademoiselle Clemence, I must plead with you

535
00:34:09,303 --> 00:34:11,303
不要利用达德利先生
not to use Mr Dudley.

536
00:34:11,303 --> 00:34:15,303
你不理解 德妮丝 我没得选择
You don't understand, Denise. I have no choice.

537
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,303
我离开巴黎是因为有一些... 困难
I left Paris because there was...some difficulty.

538
00:34:18,303 --> 00:34:21,303
我不得不在这儿谋生 我必须把合同搞到手
I have to make a life here. I must have the contract.

539
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:25,303
- 不管怎样 你一定要用这种手段吗 - 是的
- Look, whatever the reasons, must you use such methods? - Yes, I must.

540
00:34:25,303 --> 00:34:27,303
因为我是一个女人
Because I'm a woman.

541
00:34:27,303 --> 00:34:30,303
如果我是男人汤姆・威斯顿会这样对我吗?
Would Tom Weston treat me in this way if I were a man?

542
00:34:30,303 --> 00:34:34,303
他会让我一起讨论生意吗?
Will he offer me the engagement on purely business terms?

543
00:34:34,303 --> 00:34:37,303
他不会让我这么得意 除非我满足他条件
He will prevent me from prospering unless I indulge him.

544
00:34:37,303 --> 00:34:39,303
难道不是吗?
Is it not true?

545
00:34:39,303 --> 00:34:42,303
那么我还没有权利动用一切必要手段
Then am I not entitled to use whatever means necessary

546
00:34:42,303 --> 00:34:43,303
来获取平等吗?
to gain equality?

547
00:34:43,303 --> 00:34:45,863
- 
你不会这么做吗? - 不会
- Would you not do the same? - No.

548
00:34:45,864 --> 00:34:47,303
那你就落后了
Then you will be left behind.

549
00:34:48,303 --> 00:34:49,303
我来问你
Let me ask you this:

550
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:51,303
男人给你的一切
whatever has been given to you by men,

551
00:34:51,303 --> 00:34:54,303
你不担心他们会再次从你身边带走吗?
do you not live in fear that they will take it away again?

552
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:59,303
我一直观察你 也从莫里那里知道你很有才华
I have watched you. I have heard Moray talk about your many gifts.

553
00:34:59,303 --> 00:35:03,053
奥德丽女士离开后 你会接任她的职位吗?
When Miss Audrey leaves, will you be given her position?

554
00:35:03,054 --> 00:35:04,303
我不知道
I don't know.

555
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:07,226
- 我... - 你想得到这个职位吗?
- I... - Do you want it?

556
00:35:07,227 --> 00:35:08,303
你会争取吗?
Can you do it?

557
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:11,303
还有其他姑娘想...
There are other girls who just...

558
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:16,303
这个问题你一定要对自己坦诚 而不是对我
I give you the question you must answer to yourself. Not to me.

559
00:35:16,303 --> 00:35:19,303
如果职位没有给你
If the position is not given to you,

560
00:35:19,303 --> 00:35:21,303
你会关注心爱的男人
do you care more for the man you love

561
00:35:21,303 --> 00:35:23,303
胜过关注自己的心声吗?
than you do for your own voice?

562
00:35:23,303 --> 00:35:27,303
你是想当一个好姑娘? 默默地接受?
Will you be a good girl? Will you meekly accept?

563
00:35:27,303 --> 00:35:29,303
还是会大声地说出自己的心声?
Or will you speak out?

564
00:35:40,303 --> 00:35:41,303
噢!
Oh!

565
00:35:59,303 --> 00:36:02,303
罗马尼斯小姐 谢谢你的光临
Mademoiselle Romanis, thank you for coming.

566
00:36:04,303 --> 00:36:05,303
这边请
Please, this way.

567
00:36:10,303 --> 00:36:13,303
乔纳斯? 嗯...
Jonas? Mmm...

568
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:16,303
乔纳斯?
Jonas?

569
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:21,303
亚瑟告诉我们了 他是怎样在桥边找到你的
Arthur told us how he found you at the bridge.

570
00:36:21,303 --> 00:36:24,303
如果你在耍花招 我们不会上当的
If this was a trick, we are not falling for it.

571
00:36:24,303 --> 00:36:26,303
这儿的人不会同情你
There is no sympathy for you here.

572
00:36:30,303 --> 00:36:33,072
乔纳斯 过去的一年你是怎么过的?
What have you been up to this past year, Jonas?

573
00:36:33,073 --> 00:36:34,303
流...流
Tr-tr...

574
00:36:34,303 --> 00:36:38,303
呃 边流浪边工作
Er, tr-travels and...work.

575
00:36:38,303 --> 00:36:40,303
你在向我们隐瞒什么?
What are you hiding from us?

576
00:36:41,303 --> 00:36:44,303
你离开天堂百货后在做什么?
What have you been up to since you left The Paradise?

577
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:48,303
一直流浪 那就是我现在的生活
I have been on the road. That is my life now.

578
00:36:51,303 --> 00:36:55,303
我不想再提这些心酸往事了 莫里先生
I would wish not to describe the hardship, in case

579
00:36:55,303 --> 00:37:00,303
以免你因此自责 
you should feel in...in some way responsible, Mr Moray.

580
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:03,303
莫里先生不会因你的遭遇而受任何谴责
Mr Moray is not to blame for your plight.

581
00:37:03,303 --> 00:37:07,303
我们都要对自己的人生负责 我明天就会离开
We are all responsible for our own life. I shall be gone by tomorrow.

582
00:37:07,303 --> 00:37:09,303
你到这来不是偶然 是吗?
It was not chance brought you here, was it?

583
00:37:09,303 --> 00:37:11,553
不要认为你能收买我们  我警告你...
If you believe you can bribe us, I warn you...

584
00:37:11,554 --> 00:37:12,303
达德利!
Dudley!

585
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:22,303
我们很欢迎你一直住在这 直到你身体完全康复
You are welcome to remain here until you are fully recovered.

586
00:37:23,303 --> 00:37:25,303
感激不尽 先生
I am most grateful, sir.

587
00:37:33,303 --> 00:37:36,303
你真无情 我从没见过你这么愤怒
You were so merciless. I've never seen you so riled.

588
00:37:36,303 --> 00:37:37,456
一见到他我就生气
That man has got beneath my skin.

589
00:37:37,457 --> 00:37:39,303
他生病了 我们就不能...
He's ill. Can we not just...

590
00:37:39,303 --> 00:37:44,303
- 不是乔纳斯 是汤姆・威斯顿 - 我保证
- Not Jonas. Tom Weston. - I promise you,

591
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:48,303
没什么可担心的 我会处理好汤姆的事
there is nothing for you to worry about. I will deal with Tom,

592
00:37:48,303 --> 00:37:49,303
但有一件事他似乎说得不对
and it's not as though he's right.

593
00:37:49,303 --> 00:37:52,085
你不是那种会追求克莱曼斯的人
You're not the kind of man to go chasing after Clemence.

594
00:37:52,086 --> 00:37:53,303
当然不是
No.

595
00:37:53,303 --> 00:37:56,303
我结婚比较早 生命里只有一个女人
I married young. I've only ever known one woman's kiss.

596
00:37:56,303 --> 00:37:59,303
所有人都知道我是什么样的人
Everyone knows what kind of man I am.

597
00:38:17,303 --> 00:38:19,303
噢 亲爱的 原来你在这
Oh, darling. There you are.

598
00:38:19,303 --> 00:38:23,303
我邀请了克莱曼斯小姐这段时间来我们家住
I have invited Mademoiselle Clemence to stay with us during her time here.

599
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:26,303
我可看不下去她再住在闷热的小旅馆里了
I can't bear the thought of her in that stuffy hotel,

600
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:29,303
我知道你们两个也想一起谈生意
and I know you two wish to talk business.

601
00:38:29,303 --> 00:38:34,303
这样合作不是会更愉快吗?
It will be so much more convivial, don't you think?

602
00:38:34,303 --> 00:38:35,303
是的
I do.

603
00:38:38,303 --> 00:38:41,303
我告诉艾德蒙我想要重新考虑一下
I have told Edmund that I may want reconsider.

604
00:38:41,303 --> 00:38:44,303
所以我叔叔才放下了"商店出售"的牌子
So that's why my uncle's taken down the "For Sale" sign.

605
00:38:44,303 --> 00:38:47,303
奥德丽女士 你不是说怀疑和推迟
Miss Audrey, did you not say it was the doubt and delay

606
00:38:47,303 --> 00:38:49,303
让你很不开心吗?
that was making you so unhappy?

607
00:38:49,303 --> 00:38:51,303
为什么女人因为结婚要受惩罚?
Why should a woman be punished for marrying?

608
00:38:51,303 --> 00:38:54,303
残忍的法国女人! 看她对我们做了什么
That bloody French woman! Look at what she's doing to us.

609
00:38:54,303 --> 00:38:57,303
她来了 厄运也来了
She comes here, all hell is let loose,

610
00:38:57,303 --> 00:38:59,303
然后她走了 留给我们一堆烂摊子
and then she'll be gone and leave us with the consequences.

611
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:03,303
我以为你们年轻姑娘能明白她是在为我们抱不平
I thought you younger women would see that she speaks for us all.

612
00:39:03,303 --> 00:39:05,389
奥德丽女士 这儿没人认为
Miss Audrey, no-one here believes

613
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,303
迫使一个女人离开是对的
it's right for a woman to be pressed

614
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:11,303
但你答应艾德蒙叔叔后又反悔就对了吗?
into leaving, but to do this to Uncle Edmund after you promised him?

615
00:39:11,303 --> 00:39:14,303
这和你人生中其他的选择一样
You have the same choice now you've had all your life.

616
00:39:14,303 --> 00:39:17,303
是什么让你改变了主意? 挑战男人?
What's made you change your mind? Is it to defy men?

617
00:39:17,303 --> 00:39:21,303
- 还是争取自身的幸福? - 我明白了
- Or is it to strive for your own happiness? - I see.

618
00:39:22,303 --> 00:39:24,303
老母鸡快要离巢了
When the old hen's about to leave the perch,

619
00:39:24,303 --> 00:39:27,303
小鸡崽们开始梳理自己的羽毛了
the young hens certainly do start to flutter their feathers.

620
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,303
和克莱曼斯小姐相处
It is such a pleasant diversion,

621
00:39:34,303 --> 00:39:37,303
真是愉快极了
having Mademoiselle Clemence to stay with us.

622
00:39:37,303 --> 00:39:39,303
她性格大胆直率
She is quite the firecracker.

623
00:39:43,303 --> 00:39:45,303
我明白男人们为什么对她如此着迷了
I can see why men fall for her.

624
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,303
也知道为什么你会痴迷于她了 亲爱的
I can see why you might fall for her, my darling.

625
00:39:54,303 --> 00:39:56,303
他告诉你的吗?
Did he tell you?

626
00:39:57,303 --> 00:39:59,303
莫里来找你了?
Did Moray come to see you?

627
00:40:04,303 --> 00:40:09,303
如果你要追求她 就在这儿吧
If you are going to pursue her, then you will do it here,

628
00:40:09,303 --> 00:40:13,303
绝对安全 不要在公众场合 也不要在天堂百货
out of harm's way. Not so publicly. NOT at The Paradise.

629
00:40:14,303 --> 00:40:19,303
还有 请不要让弗罗拉看到你讨好她
And please, do not let Flora see you fawning after her.

630
00:40:19,303 --> 00:40:23,303
你看到我讨好过别的女人吗?
Have you ever known me to fawn after anyone?

631
00:40:23,303 --> 00:40:28,303
哦 我第一次见到你的时候你就谄媚极了
Oh, when we first met you were quite the flatterer.

632
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:33,303
为什么你这么在意天堂百货?
Why are you so sensitive about The Paradise?

633
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:39,303
我希望我们不要给莫里提供任何帮助
I want us to do nothing to give Moray the upper hand.

634
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:44,303
你可以用任何手段打击他 但不要摧毁他
You can jostle with him, by all means, but do not crush him.

635
00:40:46,303 --> 00:40:48,303
让他在那儿有安全感
I want him to feel safe there.

636
00:40:50,303 --> 00:40:53,303
我绝不相信是你抛弃了他
I never believed that you abandoned him.

637
00:40:56,303 --> 00:41:01,303
如果不是他伤了你的心 为什么你要毁灭他?
Why would you need to destroy him, if he hadn't broken your heart?

638
00:41:08,303 --> 00:41:11,303
我带克莱曼斯小姐回家...
I brought Mademoiselle Clemence into our home...

639
00:41:13,303 --> 00:41:16,303
..是因为我知道我阻止不了你
..because I have learned I cannot stop you.

640
00:41:17,303 --> 00:41:19,303
你也阻止不了自己
Because you cannot stop yourself.

641
00:41:21,303 --> 00:41:25,303
我还知道这一切都将变成过眼云烟 她也是
And I have learned that it will pass, she will pass.

642
00:41:27,303 --> 00:41:30,303
当激情退去
And when the passion passes...

643
00:41:31,303 --> 00:41:33,303
你内心充满愧疚...
..and you are overcome with shame...

644
00:41:35,303 --> 00:41:37,303
..我会接你回家 安慰你
..I will pick you up and comfort you.

645
00:41:39,303 --> 00:41:43,303
好好爱你 做你的好妻子
I will love you and be a good wife to you.

646
00:41:48,303 --> 00:41:49,303
但我的爱是有条件的  汤姆
But I do not love you freely, Tom.

647
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:57,303
作为交换 你不准再过问
In exchange, you will not ask me again about what happened

648
00:41:57,303 --> 00:41:58,303
我和莫里之间的瓜葛
between Moray and I.

649
00:42:07,303 --> 00:42:10,578
什么事让你这么晚偷偷跑到我这来了?
What brings you creeping up here at night?

650
00:42:10,579 --> 00:42:12,303
我现在进退两难
I have a dilemma.

651
00:42:12,303 --> 00:42:14,033
我不知道怎么办
I don't know what to do.

652
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:17,303
- 你想征求我的意见? - 是的
- You would ask my guidance? - Of course.

653
00:42:17,303 --> 00:42:21,303
我知道即使很难回答你也会告诉我答案
I know that you'll tell me the truth, even if it is difficult.

654
00:42:21,303 --> 00:42:23,918
而且直觉告诉我你知道我该怎么做
And something told me you'd know what I should do.

655
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:25,303
关于小姐的?
The Mademoiselle?

656
00:42:25,303 --> 00:42:28,303
她好像故意引诱达德利先生
She seems intent on seducing Mr Dudley.

657
00:42:30,303 --> 00:42:33,303
你还没有告诉达德利先生
And you haven't told Mr Dudley

658
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:35,303
你知道她对他有什么企图吗?
what you know about her motives towards him?

659
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:39,303
如果我告诉达德利了先生 这...
If I speak to Mr Dudley about it, it...

660
00:42:41,303 --> 00:42:44,303
就好像我在谴责他
..it would be as though I'm accusing him

661
00:42:44,303 --> 00:42:47,303
意图对妻子不忠
of wanting to be unfaithful to his wife,

662
00:42:47,303 --> 00:42:49,303
我不知道我能否办得到
and I don't know that I can do that.

663
00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:56,303
达德利先生到这来了 我从没听过他那样讲话
Mr Dudley came here, talking as I've never heard him talk before.

664
00:42:58,303 --> 00:43:03,303
他很愤怒 内心很挣扎
He was like a man on fire. A man at war with himself.

665
00:43:05,303 --> 00:43:10,303
他的口袋里有一张洒了香水的卡片 可能是邀请函
He had a scented card in his pocket. An invitation, probably.

666
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:14,303
我怀疑今晚他会去见她
I suspect he will meet with her tonight.

667
00:43:20,303 --> 00:43:21,303
艾德蒙?
Edmund?

668
00:43:31,303 --> 00:43:33,303
艾德蒙?
Edmund?

669
00:43:33,303 --> 00:43:37,303
亲爱的 我可以私下和你说几句话吗?
Might we speak privately, my dear?

670
00:43:37,303 --> 00:43:39,303
我献身给这家酒吧了
I'm rather wedded to the bar.

671
00:43:40,303 --> 00:43:42,303
有什么话就在这说吧
You can say whatever you want to say right here.

672
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:50,303
你似乎理解错了我的决定
You seem to have taken my decision rather personally.

673
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:54,303
你不能理解的是 我的推理中涉及到的
What you fail to appreciate is that my reasoning concerns

674
00:43:54,303 --> 00:43:57,303
女性被迫放弃工作的不公平性
the injustice to a woman having to give up her position.

675
00:43:57,303 --> 00:44:00,303
那我必须放弃的东西呢?
What about what I must give up?

676
00:44:00,303 --> 00:44:03,303
我就没有努力让小商店存活下来
Have I not fought to keep my little shop alive

677
00:44:03,303 --> 00:44:04,303
度过最艰难的时期吗?
through the worst of times?

678
00:44:06,303 --> 00:44:09,187
你认为我举起"商店出售"的牌子
Do you suppose I put up a "For Sale" sign

679
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,303
就像系鞋带一样容易吗?
as easily as tying my shoelace?

680
00:44:11,303 --> 00:44:13,303
这对我来说如切肤之痛
It is a wrench to my heart.

681
00:44:15,303 --> 00:44:16,303
但是我心甘情愿
But I did it willingly.

682
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,303
我以为你也会如此
I thought you would do the same.

683
00:44:21,303 --> 00:44:25,303
但是我错了 我现在明白了
I was wrong. I see that now.

684
00:44:26,303 --> 00:44:30,303
老板再来一杯 我比这黑夜还沧桑啊!
Let us have ale, Landlord. The night is younger than I am!

685
00:44:48,303 --> 00:44:51,303
给你表演一个 看到这枚硬币没?
Let me show you this. You see this coin?

686
00:44:51,303 --> 00:44:54,303
好 我们把它放在这只手上 请说"嘛咪嘛咪轰"
OK, we're going to put it in this hand. Can you say, "abracadabra"?

687
00:44:54,303 --> 00:44:57,303
- "嘛咪嘛咪轰"! - 然后吹口气
- Abracadabra! - And now blow.

688
00:44:57,303 --> 00:45:01,303
啊 它不见了! 去哪了呢? 再吹口气
Oh, it's not there! Where is it? Blow now.

689
00:45:02,303 --> 00:45:06,303
这儿也没有! 弗罗拉你对它做了什么?
Oh, it's not here too! What did you do with it, Flora?

690
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,303
- 我什么也没干 - 哦我看见它了!
- I didn't do anything. - Oh, I see it!

691
00:45:08,303 --> 00:45:13,303
- 天啊 - 在你的头发里!
- Oh, mon Dieu! - It was in your hair!

692
00:45:13,303 --> 00:45:17,303
- 我在你头发里发现的 给你了 - 谢谢
- And because I found it in your hair, it's for you. - Thank you.

693
00:45:20,303 --> 00:45:23,303
这顿晚餐真是其乐无穷
It has been the most delightful dinner,

694
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,303
但是抱歉
but I hope you will forgive me.

695
00:45:25,303 --> 00:45:26,303
我还有个约会
I have another engagement.

696
00:45:28,303 --> 00:45:30,303
我知道这很无礼 但这就是法国人
It is rude of me, I know, but it is the way in France.

697
00:45:30,303 --> 00:45:32,303
我们大半个晚上奔波于各个约会
We flit about half the night,

698
00:45:32,303 --> 00:45:34,303
并且我是这儿最不安分的法国女人
and I'm the most restless Frenchwoman there is.

699
00:45:34,303 --> 00:45:37,303
克莱曼斯你是我们的客人 你来去自由
You are our guest, Clemence. You must come and go as you wish.

700
00:45:37,303 --> 00:45:42,303
你真纵容我 我爱死了被纵容的感觉
Oh, you are spoiling me, and I do so like being spoiled.

701
00:45:45,303 --> 00:45:50,303
谢谢 再会 感谢
Merci. Au revoir. Merci.

702
00:46:01,303 --> 00:46:05,303
- 你去哪儿? - 我有个约会
- Where are you going?  - I have arranged a rendezvous.

703
00:46:08,303 --> 00:46:09,303
和男人?
With a man?

704
00:46:11,303 --> 00:46:13,303
我想约谁就约谁
I can meet whoever I want to.

705
00:46:38,303 --> 00:46:42,303
我从不擅长和女孩子交往哈
I was never much good at talking to girls. Huh.

706
00:46:42,303 --> 00:46:45,303
我可以和她们一起共事
At work, I could pass the time with them,

707
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:50,303
但是约会什么的 我总是害羞又笨拙
but romance, ha! I was always too shy, too awkward.

708
00:46:57,303 --> 00:47:02,303
选择店中最文静的女孩会让我比较自信
I chose the most quiet girl in the shop. It made me feel confident.

709
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,303
我不想背叛我的妻子
I don't want to betray my wife.

710
00:47:31,303 --> 00:47:32,303
你真是个英俊的男人
You are a beautiful man.

711
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:26,303
威斯顿先生
Mr Weston, sir.

712
00:48:31,303 --> 00:48:34,303
我是乔纳斯 乔纳斯・弗兰克斯
I am Jonas. Jonas Franks.

713
00:48:36,303 --> 00:48:38,303
罗马尼斯小姐在吗?
Is Mademoiselle Romanis here?

714
00:48:38,303 --> 00:48:41,303
这个点了她怎么会在这呢 先生?
Why would she be here at this time of night, sir?

715
00:48:41,303 --> 00:48:43,303
我觉得她和某个男人有牵扯
I believe she has a liaison with a man.

716
00:48:43,303 --> 00:48:45,178
先生 请容我说两句
Sir, if I may,

717
00:48:45,179 --> 00:48:48,303
我观察过这位法国女士这段时间
I have observed the French lady in her time here,

718
00:48:48,303 --> 00:48:51,303
在这儿与女士们先生们的交往
both with gentlemen and with her own sex.

719
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:56,303
你要是问我她今晚去哪儿了 不可能是和一个男人
If you were to ask me where she was tonight, it would not be with a man.

720
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,303
肯定是和男人
It cannot be.

721
00:49:01,303 --> 00:49:04,303
先生 我不要求您认同我
You need not accept my consideration, sir,

722
00:49:04,303 --> 00:49:08,303
虽然我要了解人们的处事方式和弱点
though I have taught myself well to know people,

723
00:49:08,303 --> 00:49:12,303
是手到擒来的
their ways...and their weaknesses.

724
00:49:12,303 --> 00:49:17,303
在这个问题上我建议您去咨询莫里先生
Might I suggest you consult with Mr Moray on this matter?

725
00:49:17,303 --> 00:49:20,303
莫里...了解这个?
Moray...knows?

726
00:49:20,303 --> 00:49:25,303
他没告诉我 但是我能分辨出来
He has not told me so himself, but I can tell.

727
00:49:25,303 --> 00:49:27,303
请允许我推荐他
May I suggest you ask him?

728
00:49:36,303 --> 00:49:41,303
克莱曼斯小姐! 你在这干什么?
Mademoiselle Clemence! What are you doing here?

729
00:49:41,303 --> 00:49:45,303
那个男人! 乔纳斯!
That man! Jonas!

730
00:49:45,303 --> 00:49:48,303
我从来没有这么怕过握手
I was never so afraid of the touch of a hand.

731
00:49:48,303 --> 00:49:53,303
我感觉我...我不敢拒绝他
I felt I...I do not dare to refuse him.

732
00:49:53,303 --> 00:49:57,303
- 达德利先生在哪? - 我不知道
- Where is Mr Dudley?  - I don't know.

733
00:49:57,303 --> 00:49:58,303
他把达德利 带走了
He took Dudley away.

734
00:50:00,303 --> 00:50:04,303
他看我的眼神 他对我说的话...
That way he looked at me, the things he said to me...

735
00:50:04,303 --> 00:50:07,303
好像他之前认识我一样
It was like he knew me.

736
00:50:07,303 --> 00:50:11,303
乔纳斯先生想了解你就能对你了如指掌
Mr Jonas will know all there is to know about you.

737
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:15,303
小姐 你对达德利先生兴趣不大
Mademoiselle, you've shown such little regard for Mr Dudley.

738
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:19,303
你为什么非得让他颜面扫地?
Why are you so determined to make him face his own weaknesses?

739
00:50:23,303 --> 00:50:26,303
我们能与你感同身受
Your tale will be the same as the rest of us.

740
00:50:28,303 --> 00:50:31,303
人...是脆弱的
Human...weak.

741
00:50:34,303 --> 00:50:39,303
当我和你一般年纪时 我曾爱过一个人 
I did love someone once. I was young, as young as you are now.

742
00:50:41,303 --> 00:50:45,303
我见到那个姐姐时 我就知道她是我的真命天女
I met an older woman and I knew she was what I'd been waiting for.

743
00:50:47,303 --> 00:50:51,303
我放纵自己爱上了她 我很无助
I let myself love her. I was helpless.

744
00:50:52,303 --> 00:50:55,303
我肯定她会离开她丈夫 和我在一起
I felt sure she would leave her husband to be with me.

745
00:50:57,303 --> 00:50:59,303
慢慢地 我察觉她没这想法
Slowly, I learned she had no such intentions.

746
00:51:01,303 --> 00:51:03,303
她要生活在正轨上
She wanted what was considered proper.

747
00:51:05,303 --> 00:51:10,303
她为爱上我而自我厌恶 我从来没那样过
She hated herself for loving me. I would never do that.

748
00:51:11,303 --> 00:51:14,303
我决不因自己的性向自我惩罚
I would never punish myself for the way that I love.

749
00:51:15,303 --> 00:51:20,303
她嫁的是一个像达德利先生那样的人?
She was married to a man like Mr Dudley?

750
00:51:21,303 --> 00:51:23,303
一个忠诚稳重的男人
A good and faithful man.

751
00:51:24,303 --> 00:51:26,303
居家好男人
A family man.

752
00:51:28,303 --> 00:51:30,303
她怎么可以选他不选我?
How could she choose him over me?

753
00:51:33,303 --> 00:51:36,303
我给她这激情四射的生活 她为什么不要?
How could she choose that life when I offered her such passion?

754
00:51:52,303 --> 00:51:53,303
来了 来了!
I'm coming, I'm coming!

755
00:51:55,303 --> 00:51:57,303
大家来这儿 三更半夜比上班时间
More people come to this door in the dead of night

756
00:51:57,303 --> 00:51:59,303
跑得还勤!
than during business hours!

757
00:52:12,303 --> 00:52:15,303
什么女人忍心折磨这样可爱的灵魂呐?
What kind of a woman would torment such a dear soul?

758
00:52:17,303 --> 00:52:20,303
拒绝和爱的人结婚
What kind of a fool would refuse an offer of marriage

759
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,303
她得多蠢?
from the man she loves?

760
00:52:23,303 --> 00:52:27,303
我不知道你拒绝了
I didn't know you had refused.

761
00:52:27,303 --> 00:52:29,303
- 我没拒绝 - 而且我并没有求婚
- I didn't. - And there wasn't an offer.

762
00:52:30,303 --> 00:52:34,303
- 你提议的 - 确实
- You asked me. - I did.

763
00:52:38,303 --> 00:52:43,303
好吧...我现在求婚
Well...I'm asking you now.

764
00:52:45,303 --> 00:52:50,303
你回答是的时候 不能有任何迟疑
And if you say yes, there's to be no untying or doubting

765
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:54,303
- 勉强或是犹豫... - 知道了
- or declining or hesitating... -  I will.

766
00:53:10,303 --> 00:53:14,303
- 乔纳斯? - 马车在等你
- Jonas? - There's a carriage waiting to take you home, sir.

767
00:53:14,303 --> 00:53:16,303
你必须在员工到来前离开
You must leave before the staff arrive.

768
00:53:16,303 --> 00:53:19,011
他们不能看到你这个样子
They must not see you like this.

769
00:53:19,012 --> 00:53:21,303
我怎么会在这儿?
What am I doing here?

770
00:53:21,303 --> 00:53:24,303
先生 已经给您的妻子送去便条 告知你逗留
A note was sent to your wife, sir, to say that you were detained

771
00:53:24,303 --> 00:53:27,303
在莫里先生这 请她不必忧心
overnight by Mr Moray, and there was nothing for her to worry about.

772
00:53:27,303 --> 00:53:29,303
是克莱曼斯...
Clemence...

773
00:53:31,303 --> 00:53:33,303
什么也没发生 先生
Nothing happened, sir.

774
00:53:33,303 --> 00:53:35,303
你没惹上麻烦
There is nothing for you to be troubled by.

775
00:53:36,303 --> 00:53:39,303
先生 马车在等 我们得抓紧了
The carriage, sir. We must make haste.

776
00:53:47,303 --> 00:53:50,303
克莱曼斯在街上安排了一个烟花宴
Clemence has arranged a demonstration of her firecrackers,

777
00:53:50,303 --> 00:53:54,303
不管有没有我们 她决定这么做了
on the street. She has decided to go ahead, with or without us.

778
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,303
会吸引大批的人
It will draw quite a crowd.

779
00:53:56,303 --> 00:53:59,303
他们肯定想知道去哪买这烟花
They will want to know where they can buy the fireworks.

780
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:03,303
最终 这纯粹是商业问题
In the end, this is purely a business matter.

781
00:54:04,303 --> 00:54:07,303
让她签合同 摆脱她我们干
Give her the contract, let's be rid of her.

782
00:54:15,303 --> 00:54:17,303
我们会努力达到
We'll all strive to maintain

783
00:54:17,303 --> 00:54:20,303
- 您的标准 奥德丽小姐 - 荒谬
- the standards you have set us, Miss Audrey. - Nonsense.

784
00:54:20,303 --> 00:54:23,303
我走到街尾前就能忘个一干二净
I will be forgotten before I reach the end of the street.

785
00:54:31,303 --> 00:54:33,303
由你来...我有点怀疑
I have little doubt it will be you...

786
00:54:51,303 --> 00:54:55,303
你知道吗 克莱曼斯小姐说得对 
Mademoiselle Clemence is correct in what she says, you know.

787
00:55:35,303 --> 00:55:39,303
保重 德妮丝 别慌 我们不会跑了的
Take care. Don't fuss, our Denise. We're not vanishing entirely.

788
00:55:39,303 --> 00:55:41,303
商店都还没卖出去
Haven't even sold the shop yet.

789
00:55:46,303 --> 00:55:49,303
奥德丽 我们这把年纪了 快乐稍纵即逝
At our age, Audrey, you have to take the happiness

790
00:55:49,303 --> 00:55:51,303
理应乐在当下
when it comes after you.

791
00:55:51,303 --> 00:55:53,303
别管它是不是庸俗的
Even if it is tasteless and vulgar.

792
00:55:56,303 --> 00:55:57,303
驾
Walk on.

793
00:56:16,303 --> 00:56:18,303
乔纳斯
Jonas.

794
00:56:18,303 --> 00:56:20,303
达德利告诉我了你为他做的事
Dudley told me what you did for him.

795
00:56:20,303 --> 00:56:25,303
先生 你得提防威斯顿先生 我懂他那样的人
You must be careful of Mr Weston, sir. I have known men like him.

796
00:56:25,303 --> 00:56:29,303
他会和敌人同归于尽
He would destroy himself in order to destroy his enemies.

797
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:31,610
乔纳斯你要去哪?
Where are you going, Jonas?

798
00:56:31,611 --> 00:56:35,303
南方 达德利先生 天气暖点
South, Mr Dudley. I seek a warmer climate.

799
00:56:35,303 --> 00:56:37,303
要是我们请你留下呢?
What if we were to ask you to stay?

800
00:56:55,303 --> 00:56:57,303
为什么你没告诉莫里?
Why didn't you tell Moray?

801
00:56:57,303 --> 00:57:00,303
- 我不知道 - 你懂的 德妮丝
- I don't know. - You do know, Denise.

802
00:57:01,303 --> 00:57:05,303
你说的许多话都是对的
Because so many of the things you said are true,

803
00:57:05,303 --> 00:57:06,303
我想要谨记
and I want to keep them.

804
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:09,303
再见
Goodbye.

805
00:57:49,303 --> 00:57:52,303
我们一周都在申请...
We have, all week been taking applications...

806
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:54,636
接手奥德丽小姐空出的职位
for the post vacated by Miss Audrey.

807
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,303
失败? 失误?
Failure? Mistakes?

808
00:57:56,303 --> 00:57:59,303
你到底信不信我有能力接替奥德丽的位置?
Do you even believe me capable of filling Miss Audrey's shoes?

809
00:57:59,303 --> 00:58:03,303
实话说 我不能忍受选择的又是你不是我
Truth is, I cannot bear to have you chosen over me, again.

810
00:58:03,303 --> 00:58:06,303
如果你选择和我交锋 我会让你想起来
If you choose to cross swords with me, I will make you remember

811
00:58:06,303 --> 00:58:08,303
你嫁的是个士兵 我会给你迎面痛击!
you married a soldier. I will meet you head-on!

812
00:58:08,303 --> 00:58:11,303
你是他们游戏中双方的棋子 你的处境并不安全
You're both pawns in their game, that is not a safe thing to be.

813
00:58:11,303 --> 00:58:15,303
德妮丝 有人想和你私下谈谈
Denise, there is someone who would like a word with you privately.

814
00:58:17,303 --> 00:58:19,303
洛维特小姐
Miss Lovett.
