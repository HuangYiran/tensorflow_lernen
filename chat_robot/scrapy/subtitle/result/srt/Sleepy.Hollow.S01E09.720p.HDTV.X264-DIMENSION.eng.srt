1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,670
<i>Previously on Sleepy Hollow...</i>

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,850
Jennifer Mills, you've helped your sister before.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,460
Abbie wants me to bring you into this, says you'll be valuable.

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,860
But I need to know...

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,710
- Are you in or out? - In.

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,400
You fell in love, you get married,

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,720
but the whole time you have no idea that your wife is a witch.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,310
- Correct. - How could you not know?

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,780
She was protecting me.

10
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,370
We are part of an ancient order sworn to fight the darkness that hides in Sleepy Hollow.

11
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,270
We're dealing with forces so beyond our control. Beyond beyond.

12
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,140
Jenny!

13
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,360
That's the key, Lieutenant.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,430
Now, more than ever, we need Katrina.

15
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,600
What is it you're afraid to say? I believe I know why I am here.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,380
- Why? - Ichabod!

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,960
I'm pulling up to it right now.
Yes, I'll send you pictures.

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,520
I can't believe it used to belong to my family.

19
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,470
I know. I'm just so curious.

20
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,300
I want to learn everything I can about this place.

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,320
It's one of the oldest homes in the area.

22
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,760
It took me five years to secure the title.

23
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,420
Oh I'd like to restore it to its original grandeur.

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,310
We have a lot of work to do.

25
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,940
I love it.

26
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,050
Really?

27
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,270
It's history, Sam. My family's history, to be exact.

28
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,600
So show some respect.

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,720
Things happened here that need to be remembered. Looks haunted.

30
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,320
For a bodyguard, you are a very fearful man.

31
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,000
Lena. Lena!

32
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,740
Until we know it's structurally safe in there, you are not go...

33
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,310
It's amazing.

34
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,740
We should restore all of this.

35
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,850
Stubborn little brutes.

36
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,790
Sam! We should've brought the hedge clippers!

37
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,600
The place is completely...

38
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,460
I'm merely noting the eradication of a thrice-daily tradition,

39
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,910
wherein each meal is treated with the proper allowance of time.

40
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,330
Not that the "drive-through" wasn't impressive.

41
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,510
And despite this establishment's nomenclature,

42
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,160
this resembles no Scottish meal I've ever eaten.

43
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,300
These are from the Austrian Netherlands, for one thing.

44
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,490
And dreadfully prepared.

45
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,980
This is probably as much of a Thanksgiving as we're getting.

46
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,480
What about your sister? This is "family time. "

47
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,010
I don't think my having conservatorship over her since her release from the nuthouse necessarily leads

48
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,840
to "pass the cranberry sauce. "

49
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,860
The what?

50
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,680
Turkey, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie.

51
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,990
You know, all the stuff the Pilgrims ate.

52
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,490
The Pilgrims didn't have any sugar to make a sauce,

53
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,000
let alone a pie.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,160
And venison, not turkey, was served.

55
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,240
It would've been a miracle for a single half-starved pheasant...

56
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,180
Hold up.

57
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,370
Pheasants?

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,300
All this talk of holidays, turkeys, family time...

59
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,220
irks me.

60
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,240
Because of Katrina.

61
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,290
If I can't be with my wife during a time of thanks and celebration,

62
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,640
why must there be so many constant reminders of the inescapable fact that I...

63
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:00,680
You're alone.

64
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,970
I mean no disrespect.

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,350
Your company holds the greatest value to me.

66
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:10,910
Crane...

67
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,410
You have a right to be angry.

68
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,280
You've lost more than anyone ever should.

69
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,240
Besides, what are holidays for if not airing our grievances?

70
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,710
After our nuptials,

71
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,630
I had such hope for the life Katrina and I were to share.

72
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,370
It's been a crazy few weeks.

73
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,560
You'll feel better after a night off.

74
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,360
Crane, Mills... Got something for you.

75
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,680
Kindly inform me when that night arrives.

76
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,960
So much for the proper allowance of time.

77
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,390
Lena Gilbert... Philanthropist, author, socialite.

78
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,020
Miss Gilbert's lineage goes back generations, to the Founding Fathers.

79
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,620
She looks great in fancy dresses, too. Why is she our concern?

80
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,980
That was two days ago. No one has seen her since.

81
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,840
Normally, not a problem, but she didn't show up at a fund raiser in DC last night.

82
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,420
About an hour ago, the Senate Majority Leader contacted me personally to check on her whereabouts.

83
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,520
Apparently we're not supposed to lose track of billionaires.

84
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,530
Sorry... I'm not mistaken... You did just say she is a...

85
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,330
billionaire, correct? Yes.

86
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,820
Meaning she has a billion... dollars?

87
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,690
That's the gross national income of all 13 colonies, in my lifetime.

88
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,520
Sounds like a rich lady took a wrong turn on the way to her country home.

89
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,160
Any of the other units can handle it.

90
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,300
A member of her staff faxed this over... Copy of a note they found in Lena's handwriting on her desk.

91
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,030
That's your wife's name, isn't it?

92
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,890
I thought you might be interested.

93
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,240
Okay, yeah, that's an interesting coincidence,

94
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,800
but if she's supposed to be in DC, how do we even know that she is still in the area?

95
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,180
Her assistant tracked the GPS on her car.

96
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,720
The last ping was here in Sleepy Hollow.

97
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,880
After that... fell off the map, disappeared.

98
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,280
Keep me posted.

99
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,650
It could be a different Katrina.

100
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,730
It's not just Katrina.

101
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,210
"Katrina C.," as in "Katrina Crane. "

102
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,050
One initial does not a connection make.

103
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,580
Oh, you've surely come to realize by now, Lieutenant, that when the two of us are involved,

104
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,380
rarely is a coincidence a coincidence.

105
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,590
The captain said Miss Gilbert's lineage

106
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,640
dates back to the Founding Fathers.

107
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,050
Could your... wondrous Internet

108
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,900
perform a search on Miss Gilbert's ancestry?

109
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,370
What are we looking for?

110
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,740
Ties to landowners within the confines of the Sleepy Hollow area.???????????

111
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,380
Dating back to my era.

112
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,510
Gilbert.

113
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,420
All right, father's side,

114
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,510
ownership of New World Steel, Dune Chemicals...

115
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,200
mother's side, maiden name... Fredericks.

116
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,100
Owned mining interests, invested in railroads.

117
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,020
Seemed like they owned half the Eastern Seaboard at one time.

118
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,540
Of course.

119
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,300
Fredericks Manor.

120
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,780
Named for Lachlan Fredericks,

121
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,750
influential landowner and charter member of the Continental Congress.

122
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,640
Needless to say, a keen supporter of the war effort.

123
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,570
And, I assume, a friend of yours.

124
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,440
I know where Miss Gilbert went.

125
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,990
I pulled the land title and deed from city hall.

126
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,510
This place has had a few different owners,

127
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:34,060
but no one's actually lived here for more than a few weeks since Lachlan Fredericks.

128
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,510
It's empty. Inside, maybe?

129
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,210
It's not possible.

130
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,140
Fredericks Manor... This is where you wanted to go, right?

131
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,720
It is indeed.

132
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:00,040
But it hardly resembles the residence Katrina and I visited during the war.

133
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,920
<i>Katrina had been requesting to visit the estate for months.</i>

134
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,250
<i>Finally, my schedule allowed me to accept an invitation.</i>

135
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,430
<i>We had such a beautiful day together.</i>

136
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,690
Ichabod, we must find our gracious host.

137
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,490
Welcome to Fredericks Manor. May I take your coat?
Thank you.

138
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,970
<i>The manor belonged to Lachlan Fredericks.</i>

139
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,670
<i>I knew of him as a dedicated supporter of the war,</i>

140
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:38,520
<i>a close friend of Washington's,</i> <i>but I had no knowledge of his other causes.</i>

141
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,540
Look around, my love. What do you see?

142
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,240
They're all free. They choose to work here.

143
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,650
This estate is a safe haven.

144
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,910
A place for anyone seeking refuge.

145
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,590
Is that not beautiful?

146
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,000
<i>Everyone there, regardless of the color of their skin,</i>

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,950
<i>was free and guaranteed Lachlan's protection.</i>

148
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,190
<i>This was a sanctuary.</i>

149
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,440
Most of the manor's visitors were former slaves.

150
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,320
Many of them remained in Lachlan's employment,

151
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,230
earning a fair wage, as every human should.

152
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,020
I can't fathom how such beauty fell into such ruin.

153
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,340
Or why somebody who dated George Clooney would want to buy it.

154
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,700
An Irishman?

155
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,180
Miss Gilbert?

156
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,970
Unbelievable.

157
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,030
Sheriff's Department! Let me see your hands!

158
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,740
Show me your hands now!

159
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,030
Lord...

160
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,540
His face.

161
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,220
Looks like some kind of animal attack.

162
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,530
Sam Calvern.

163
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,240
Works for a private security company.

164
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,490
I'm gonna assume this guy was with Lena.

165
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,910
Lieutenant...

166
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,330
They're fresh.

167
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,960
Looks like she was dragged away from here. Miss Gilbert may still be alive.

168
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,010
Charlie-six-two, requesting additional units.

169
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,210
Six-two, did you copy?

170
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,800
No signal.

171
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,620
Gonna try outside.

172
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,240
Jammed shut. Allow me.

173
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,610
There's gotta be another way out of here.

174
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,230
This is not happening. Not to be an alarmist...

175
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,380
But we're in a damn haunted house.

176

179
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:01,090
These boards are stuck fast. There must be an exit.

180
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,210
I am not staying in here.

181
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,360
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

182
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,670
That is not going to happen. We're trapped in here.

183
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,550
Likely for a reason.

184
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,410
I'm uncertain what this house desires from us, or Miss Gilbert.

185
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,400
If she's still alive, I assume our best course of action is to locate her

186
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,930
and ensure her safety. Right. Good plan.

187
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,140
Hello?

188
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,890
Lieutenant? Where are you going?

189
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,490
- Did you see her? - Who?

190
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,750
The woman.

191
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,250
- She was right in front of us. - What woman?

192
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,730
All right.

193
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,540
We've faced witches,

194
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,470
a headless rider of death,

195
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,260
a demon who invades our dreams,

196
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,490
I'm sure we can brave this little crisis.

197
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,960
I am saying haunted houses do not work for me.

198
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,030
Not as a child, not now, not ever.

199
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,710
There's a line.

200
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,290
She's not here. Let's move on.

201
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,200
Wait...

202
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,460
Gulliver's Travels.

203
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,760
Swift.

204
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,550
Katrina's favorite novel.

205
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,900
She owned a copy identical to this.

206
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,520
- What is it? - It's a letter.

207
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,720
- It survived all these years. - Addressed to Katrina?

208
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,820
One I wrote to her.

209
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,250
The morning I faced the Horseman.

210
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,010
"My beloved. "If this missive reaches you,

211
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,130
"it means the worst has come to pass and I have fallen in battle. "

212
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,200
I had asked Washington's aide-de-camp to deliver it

213
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,460
should my mission to confront the Horseman prove fatal.

214
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,940
Which he would have done, several days later.

215
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,990
She must have returned here while you were buried.

216
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,650
And leave my letter in her favorite book?

217
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,520
It's as though I was meant to find it.

218
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,410
- I don't understand. - Me neither.

219
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,210
Something's not right about it.

220
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,860
We gotta find this woman.

221
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,380
Miss Gilbert?

222
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,850
Sheriff's Department.

223
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,960
Lena?

224
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,720
So it wasn't like this before,

225
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,190
all haunted and with crows?

226
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,410
No...

227
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,840
At the height of the war, this was a place of hope,

228
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,700
a force for good.

229
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,930
When we finally met our host,

230
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,590
he was charming, warm, intelligent...

231
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,380
everything Washington said he'd be.

232
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,900
Ichabod Crane,

233
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,750
I am your most ardent admirer, sir.

234
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,730
May I present our house matron.

235
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,660
Mrs. Grace Dixon, your reputation for helping

236
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,460
those in need precedes you.

237
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,370
In retrospect,

238
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,520
it is very possible that their home was also a refuge from supernatural threats.

239
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,250
Lachlan and Grace talked of evil. Considering the state of this place,

240
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,260
it stands to reason that some demonic force

241
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,130
caught up with them, targeted this place,

242
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,870
turned it from a sanctuary to a prison.

243
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,810
If someone or something had it out for Lachlan,

244
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,940
maybe they've had it out for Lena, too.

245
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,170
She is his descendant. You may well be right.

246
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,250
More evidence of Miss Gilbert's struggle.

247
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,180
After you. I insist.

248
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,540
Miss Gilbert?

249
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,950
The closet.

250
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,530
Oh, my God. Miss Gilbert, we are here to help you.

251
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,340
It's okay. We've got you.

252
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,750
No, don't do that.

253
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,690
Crane...?

254
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,820
Please... You don't understand...

255
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,800
This house is alive!

256
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,620
We've got you.

257
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,460
The roots... They dragged me.

258
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,770
- They wouldn't let me go. 

259
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,890
I don't know what it was. It's okay. Breathe.

260
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,780
Come and sit, come and sit, come and sit.

261
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,290
All right, look at me.

262
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,100
Hello. Now, it's my understanding

263
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,680
that you are a descendant of the man who lived here,

264
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,490
Lachlan Fredericks.

265
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,450
He was an ally to a great and true cause,

266
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,180
and as brave a soul as I ever met.

267
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,520
So why don't we honor his memory

268
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,020
by getting out of this nightmare in one piece?

269
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,650
Mills, where are you?

270
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,550
Just 'cause it's the holidays, doesn't mean you don't have to check in.

271
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,280
Call me back. Your sister's here. I'm dealing with her B.S.

272
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,780
- Someone's in a mood. - Yeah, you have no idea.

273
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,910
You better have what I asked for.

274
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,000
Thanks for the loaner.

275
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,820
- You stole that. - We were fighting demons that were trying to bust out the Horseman.

276
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,700
There was a lot of confusion. I lost track of what gun belongs to where.

277
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,810
I left you that message five days ago.

278
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,050
- I'm here now, aren't I? - The rest?

279
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,560
Come on, don't waste my time. I thought it was a gift.

280
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,020
You know, for helping save everyone's ass? Cigars are a gift.

281
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,670
Jewelry is a gift.

282
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,280
Maybe I'm a different kind of girl. This conversation is over.

283
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,580
- So... - As in, you leave.

284
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,410
Fine.

285
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,340
It was a stupid idea anyway.

286
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,460
What? It's just, it's the holidays...

287
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,770
- And...? - Nothing. Forget it.

288
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,290
I was thinking of having people over for Thanksgiving dinner

289
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,810
to say thank you to Abbie for taking me in, and I thought, you know,

290
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:01,430
if you didn't have plans...
You're gonna cook?

291
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,800
I can cook.

292
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,110
So this is a normal dinner type thing.

293
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,620
You make turkey and gravy, I bring some pie.

294
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,740
- Crane and Mills will be there? - Yep.

295
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,640
We act like normal people for a change.

296
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,660
One night only, I promise.
Then I go back to stealing from you.

297
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,810
- That's funny. - Um, am I interrupting?

298
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,960
Macey is here.

299
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,500
- I-I can come back. - No, no, this is Jenny Mills.

300
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,500
And, uh, I was just leaving.

301
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,050
Hey, I wasn't expecting you.

302
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,330
Aw, my little bean.

303
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,210
There's gotta be another way out.

304
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,270
Another exit we haven't thought of yet.

305
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,060
Miss Gilbert, you left a note on your desk.

306
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,140
You'd circled the name "Katrina C."

307
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,810
 Katrina Crane.

308
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,620
I found her name in a registry from the late 1700s.

309
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,620
She was the last person who came here for sanctuary before the manor was abandoned.

310
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,400
My name is Ichabod Crane. Katrina was my...

311
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,310
Relative. He's related to her.

312
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,040
Would you mind telling us what you're doing here?

313
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,090
Um, this place has always been a family mystery.

314
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:24,060
No one knows what happened to it or to my great-great-great- whatever-grandfather Lachlan.

315
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,910
When I found that registry with Katrina on it,

316
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,160
I thought maybe I'd found the key to unlocking the truth.

317
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,840
So I bought the manor back and came here, hoping something would make sense.

318
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,820
And yet you've found no clue as to what dark force took hold of this refuge?

319
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,670
Just a legend that Lachlan was more than a passionate abolitionist.

320
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:44,120
That he was also involved in witchcraft.

321
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,270
That might explain why Katrina was so keen to visit this place.

322
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,500
If your ancestor was a warlock,

323
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,430
using witchcraft to protect those seeking refuge on his property,

324
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,120
perhaps he was a member of my...

325
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,110
relative's coven.

326
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,950
Did you just say "coven"?

327
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,560
Katrina was a witch,

328
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,110
and a very dear friend of your forefather's.

329
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,450
When I freed you from those roots, they bled.

330
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,970
Whatever malevolent being attacked this house,

331
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,730
triumphing over Lachlan's protections,

332
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:26,280
it has infested the property. Something terrible happened here.

333
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,360
And it had something to do with Katrina.

334
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,330
There must be some answer, something in your research.

335
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,240
Possibly, but all of it's back in New York.

336
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,230
Okay, it's time to go.

337
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,750
- What is it? - Quickly.

338
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,130
Crane, there was something back there.

339
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,990
Something bigger. Yes, I saw.

340
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,970
??????????????????????

341
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,290
We can't stay back here. Where would you have us go?

342
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,560
Everyone...

343
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,420
Go ahead. I'm right behind you.

344
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,940
Lieutenant, come on!

345
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,410
Crane!

346
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,180
Lieutenant! Down here!

347
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,760
Lieutenant!

348
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,400
Stand back.

349
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,020
Give me your hand. Your hand.

350
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,540
Lieutenant, give me your hand.

351
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,490
Miss Gilbert...

352
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,750
Oh, no.

353
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,420
Crane? Where are you?

354
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,230
Crane?

355
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,760
It's time.

356
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,170
Ex-Excuse me...

357
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,120
That was good, Mills.

358
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,750
Talk to the ghost.

359
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,200
Excuse me.

360
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,280
Coming through.

361
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,700
Excuse me.

362
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,080
Thank you.

363
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,240
Not gonna say hello?

364
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,190
I mean... you're dating my dad... 

365
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,540
there's no point being a coward about it.

366
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,740
- We have to meet at some point. - I'm not dating your dad.

367
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,640
I don't even really like your dad.

368
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,770
Sometimes me, either.

369
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,800
Macey.

370
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,820
Jenny.

371
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,860
You're so not a cop. Definitely not.

372
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:35,560
My sister is. Must be cool.

373
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:40,300
Having a sister to look out for you like that. Uh, yeah. Can be.

374
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,260
She's a bit of a hard-ass.

375
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,180
Try growing up with my dad.

376
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,460
Honestly, I can't even imagine.

377
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,420
Well, you know, it's better now.

378
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,270
He works here. I live in the city.

379
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,630
The man's always busy, so, you know, I don't really have to deal

380
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,700
with his BS much of the time.

381
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,770
Just me and my mom. I'm cool with that.

382
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,650
I never had much of a mom or dad.

383
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,240
Don't know what it's supposed to be like, but...

384
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,100
maybe give him a chance.

385
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,460
He's not a completely terrible person.

386
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,190
Just some friendly advice.

387
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,900
I know it's not the most romantic spot, but...

388
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,900
it's private.

389
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,090
I'll make this brief. I know, um, I know you're busy.

390
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,030
Just so you know, there is nothing going on between...

391
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:36,890
Whatever you do on your own time is-is none of my business.

392
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:40,570
But how you behave as a parent is.

393
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:45,010
One weekend... That's all Macey's seen from you since you transferred here.

394
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,960
One weekend.

395
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,710
All she knows is-is "something came up. "

396
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,580
I call every day, Cynthia...

397
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,700
You know what? It's not working.

398
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,490
When you were assigned here...

399
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,060
it was supposed to be better for everyone.

400
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,650
Smaller town, easier...

401
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,690
workload, a place where Macey can get out of the city.

402
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,930
Your words. I'll make it up to her.

403
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:13,580
All I see is a small-town precinct...

404
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,990
a tenth of the size of your old one.

405
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,520
What could possibly be such a challenge in Sleepy Hollow?

406
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,450
Cynthia...

407
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,460
I know it doesn't make sense, but the work I'm doing here is important.

408
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,590
Okay. Well, then why can't you have someone else handle it?

409
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,190
I can't.

410
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,710
- It has to be me. - Do you hear yourself?

411
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,220
Is this the kind of father you want to be?

412
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,580
I'm trying, Cynthia.

413
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,020
I want to make things right with Macey. That's why I moved here.

414
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,610
What happened, happened.

415
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:49,700
And we're dealing with it, she's dealing with it, and she's doing well.

416
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,930
But it won't last...

417
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:55,410
if you hide from your responsibilities as a father.

418
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,650
She needs stability...

419
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,780
not any more disappointment.

420
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,160
There's no other way to say this.

421
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:14,020
I had some... papers drawn up...

422
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,620
demanding full custody.

423
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,920
If you cancel one more weekend... I will file.

424
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,350
For her sake.

425
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,340
You would do that to me?

426
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,460
This is not me.

427
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,930
This is you, Frank.

428
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,020
Crane? Lena?

429
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,680
It's coming.

430
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,720
Hurry.

431
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,940
The pain is rising. She's close now.

432
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,600
The child is coming.

433
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,640
- Please, are we safe? - You and your child are safe.

434
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,210
All you need to do is bring this life into our world.

435
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,560
I can't do it.

436
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,540
Look at me, Mrs. Crane.

437
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,440
I can't do this, - not without Ichabod. - You have to.

438
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,590
For your sake and the child's, hmm?

439
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,780
Now, breathe.

440
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,290
That's it! That's it. You're doing beautifully.

441
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,590
Now push. That's it.

442
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,720
Push!

443
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,350
Push!

444
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,370
Good. That's it. A blanket.

445
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,130
The baby's coming. Now...

446
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,710
Strength, now.

447
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,120
Push!

448
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,350
Good. That's it.

449
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,520
Mrs. Crane...

450
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,420
it's a boy. I have a son.

451
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,600
I have a son.

452
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,350
I have a son.

453
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,180
Lieutenant, shh, shh, shh.

454
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,620
This way. What happened to you?

455
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,850
- Where is Lena? - The creature took her.

456
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:23,410
Dragged her away like a toy. I couldn't stop him.

457
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:26,860
Obviously, the creature is more than simply an agent - of destruction. - Crane, I need to tell you something.

458
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,940
- He infested this place for a reason. - Crane...

459
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,300
Crane...

460
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,650
This was an attack, aimed at Lachlan,

461
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,340
who I'm not certain is in league with Katrina,

462
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,960
- perhaps even a part of her coven... - It was Katrina.

463
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,480
I saw Katrina giving birth.

464
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,340
What did you say?

465
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,600
Downstairs.

466
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,780
I had a vision.

467
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,730
I saw what happened here.

468
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:56,070
 Katrina came back here because she was going to have a baby.

469
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,860
No.

470
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,710
No, I'm sorry, you must be mistaken.

471
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,010
She would have told me.

472
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,270
Or she needed to keep it secret.

473
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,530
If Lachlan was really part of Katrina's coven,

474
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:19,220
it would have made sense for her to come here and give birth.

475
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,780
Come on. Hurry, get her inside.

476
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,520
She would have figured the protective hex he placed

477
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,320
on the property... would keep her

478
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,950
and your baby safe.

479
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,630
What was it?

480
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,490
The baby.

481
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,160
It was a son.

482
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:56,860
You had a son.

483
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,480
Crane, there's more.

484
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,190
Something happened during the birth.

485
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,590
What happened?

486
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,370
Ichabod would be... overjoyed, Katrina.

487
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,950
Lachlan, what's going on?

488
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,100
They've broken through the protections. Something came after the baby,

489
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,580
beating the hex by growing inside the property.

490
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,890
That creature, the evil in this house,

491
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,990
attacked the moment your child was brought into this world.

492
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,550
Lachlan did everything he could to protect them.

493
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,880
Lachlan knew this creature had to be sent by Moloch.

494
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,130
Take them now. Use my personal carriage. Go.

495
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,040
Abbie...

496
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,830
What happened to my son?

497
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,060
Please.

498
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,070
I need to know.

499
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,940
I don't know.

500
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,660
That's all I saw.

501
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,170
Then he could have survived.

502
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,740
They both could have escaped the creature.

503
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,950
Crane...

504
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:04,320
Miss Gilbert, are you hurt?

505
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,180
No...

506
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,060
No...

507
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,290
Miss Gilbert!

508
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,280
- Miss Gilbert! - Can't get a clean shot!

509
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:32,290
Go! Go! Run!

510
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,990
Where did she go?

511
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,140
I don't know.

512
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,760
Lieutenant... the roots!

513
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,380
He's felt it!

514
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,290
How do we escape?

515
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,820
This way.

516
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,450
Lieutenant!

517
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,360
This way! I found a way out.

518
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,760
What are you doing? Stay with Miss Gilbert.

519
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,090
My business here isn't finished.

520
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,440
- Crane... - That thing came after my son!

521
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,560
Listen to me... We're gonna make this thing right.

522
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,760
- You just have to stay with me! - Keep her safe.

523
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,400
- Crane! - Heed my words.

524
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,340
Do not follow me.

525
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,040
I know who you serve.

526
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,050
I know why you came here.

527
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,390
Did you think you could attack those I love without consequence?!

528
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,300
Huh? That you could come for my wife?

529
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,980
My child?!

530
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:23,230
Give Moloch my regards.

531
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,450
My God.

532
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,830
I should like to go home now.

533
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,110
There you are.

534
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,520
So, I'm thinking... Jenny's burnt turkey and gluten-free pumpkin pie

535
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,790
might be just what you need to lift your spirits.

536
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,770
Okay, it's not the greatest sales pitch.

537
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,170
There will be rum.

538
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,180
It's your favorite.

539
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,470
Barbadian Best Amber.

540
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,980
I believe I would not have survived Valley Forge without it.

541
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,730
I'm much obliged, Miss Mills.

542
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,390
But in my present state, I fear I would not be pleasant company.

543
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,960
Look...

544
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,380
Thanksgiving isn't easy for everyone.

545
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,310
When I was a kid, I remember...

546
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,210
walking on the street, passing houses on my block,

547
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,720
looking in windows,

548
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,580
seeing people, families,

549
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,920
sitting around tables, laughing, carving turkeys.

550
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,840
I was just so envious.

551
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,750
I wanted that more than anything.

552
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,390
I had it... in England.

553
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:34,300
During my father's holidays from teaching at Oxford,

554
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,740
I would sit by the hearth,

555
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:43,390
and he'd regale me with glorious tales

556
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,060
of ancient Greece.

557
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,980
And I really believed I'd follow his footsteps...

558
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:52,390
I'd be a professor in my own right,

559
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:57,800
yet upheld by his pride for me.

560
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,970
And that one day, I would have a son,

561
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:06,230
and I'd share that same comfort that I felt so freely.

562
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,890
I'm guessing that's what the point of this is?

563
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,870
The time for reflection.

564
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,020
You see what you have now,

565
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:18,660
and you embrace what's in front of you.

566
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,940
Oh, I nearly forgot.

567
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,990
This arrived for you this afternoon.

568
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,570
More treasures from the Amazon, perhaps.

569
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,370
It's from Lena Gilbert.

570
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:45,670
The records from Fredericks Manor throughout the years.

571
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,720
Documentation on Mrs. Grace Dixon...

572
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,480
the manor's house matron.

573
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,240
A list of her progeny.

574
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,100
Family tree.

575
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,680
Lori Roberts.

576
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,940
My mother.

577
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:17,150
You're a descendant of Grace Dixon.

578
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,330
My ancestor brought your son into this world.

579
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,310
Quite heroically.

580
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,700
I see the family resemblance.

581
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,920
It seems that you and I...

582
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,860
our paths were intertwined from the very start.

583
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,570
It definitely would seem.

584
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,230
We have a drink.

585
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,010
It's a day of giving thanks.

586
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:58,040
To family. To finding family.

587
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,170
