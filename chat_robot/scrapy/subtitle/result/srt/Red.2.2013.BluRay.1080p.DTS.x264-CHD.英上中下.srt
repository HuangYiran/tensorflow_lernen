Do you remember Nightshade?

有点模糊印象 它是某种炸弹，我想

可是你得了解，我为美国人。造过很多东西，还有

Nightshade turned out to be a bit of a nightmare.

所以很自然地，他们不得不 把我囚禁在这个地方

And after what they did to me, I think it's perfectly natural

我们不能让贝利或是夜暮，落入恐怖分子之手，否则将伏尸百万

我的天啊，这个居然是真的

Unless we secure it, that weapon's going off in the middle of Moscow.
如果我们不能及时接管它，这武器会在莫斯科中心地带被引爆

我们给扫地出门了，对不，老伙计？

When we're no longer convenient, I suppose.
我猜是因为我们不再有用了

907
01:07:14,263 --> 01:07:16,897
As though we'd never given them the best years of our lives.
似乎我们再也不能，为他们奉上生命中最美好的部分
