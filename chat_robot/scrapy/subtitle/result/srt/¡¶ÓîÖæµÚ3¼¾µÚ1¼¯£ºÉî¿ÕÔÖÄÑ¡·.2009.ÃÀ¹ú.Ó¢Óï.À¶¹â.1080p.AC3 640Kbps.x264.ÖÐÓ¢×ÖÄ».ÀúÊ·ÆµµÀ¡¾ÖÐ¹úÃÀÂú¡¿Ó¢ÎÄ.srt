2
00:00:01,626 --> 00:00:04,086
In the beginning, there was darkness...

3
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,213
and then, bang...

4
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,425
giving birth to an endless expanding existence...

5
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,844
of time, space, and matter.

6
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:14,346
Now, see further than we've ever imagined...

7
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,265
beyond the limits of our existence...

8
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:19,101
in a place we call " The Universe. "

9
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:25,107
In space, threats can come from any direction:

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,193
meteors from deep space...

11
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:32,656
invisible but deadly bursts of radiation from the Sun...

12
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:38,787
otherworldly landslides from above and Marsquakes from below.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,957
Outer space is the last place you want to be as a human being.

14
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:46,170
What makes fire more deadly in orbit than on Earth?

15
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:51,300
What happens to someone exposed to the harsh extremes of outer space?

16
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:55,471
The saliva, the blood, goes from a liquid state to a gaseous state.

17
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,768
Buckle up and prepare for " Space Disasters. "

18
00:01:06,431 --> 00:01:10,768

19
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,667
The year is 2030.

20
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,294
A crew of astronauts...

21
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,839
simply hits the " up " button in a space elevator.

22
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,842
The elevator will bring them to their spacecraft...

23
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,511
which will meet them in orbit.

24
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:40,808
They're grateful they don't have to risk the controlled explosion of a rocket launch.

25
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,312
We can now create carbon nanotube fibers...

26
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,190
that are stronger than steel.

27
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,318
And believe it or not, they are strong enough...

28
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:55,239
to keep a space elevator afloat in space...

29
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,534
so that you can literally climb your way into the heavens.

30
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:05,707
The 60,000-mile cable is attached to the docking station...

31
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,960
that revolves at the same rate as the Earth.

32
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,964
Just like a geosynchronous satellite...

33
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,590
it stays over a fixed spot on the ground.

34
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,138
A space elevator would be any astronaut's dream.

35
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,142
But the space elevator dream...

36
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:28,689
can also turn into a nightmare.

37
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,441
The space elevator has to be anchored to the Earth.

38
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,320
But what happens if we have storms...

39
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:39,908
and, all of a sudden, the moorings begin to snap?

40
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,664
With the cable still attached up in space...

41
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,916
it will start swinging wildly...

42
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,795
striking objects hundreds of miles away in any direction.

43
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,758
It's also possible that some type of guidance computer...

44
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:01,263
or thruster problem could knock the platform in space off-course...

45
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,472
snapping the cable at the top.

46
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,479
lf it happened while a crew was going up or down the cable...

47
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,694
they would be in for the last ride of their lives.

48
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,450
And the 60,000 miles of cable, hurtling toward Earth...

49
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,119
is long enough to wrap itself around the planet...

50
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:29,416
almost three times at the equator, creating havoc over a wide area.

51
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,923
It would be not only disastrous and dangerous for the people involved...

52
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,467
the kinetic energy of something like that...

53
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:42,679
whipping through the atmosphere, would be a menace to navigation...

54
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:48,143
so it's going to have an inherent danger in it that any human system has.

55
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:56,193
This is just one of many potential disasters facing future space explorers.

56
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,540
Living in space will also involve grave dangers.

57
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,044
Colonies on the Moon or Mars...

58
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,380
will be faced with threats from all directions...

59
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,968
especially above...

60
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,348
where sudden spikes of radiation can turn deadly.

61
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,314
If we were walking around on the surface of the Moon...

62
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,653
I would say our number one concern should be solar flare.

63
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,156
The Sun erupts.

64
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,078
The protons coming from that flare could kill an astronaut.

65
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,999
There have been several flares over the last couple decades...

66
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,459
which, if we had had astronauts on the Moon...

67
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,546
just walking around in a spacesuit, would have been lethal for them.

68
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,845
On Earth, we're protected from most radiation.

69
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:10,434
Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field are like a protective fence...

70
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,270
letting only a fraction of particles through.

71
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,690
On the Moon and Mars, you are directly in the firing line.

72
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,780
The Moon has no atmosphere or magnetic field.

73
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,657
Mars has very little atmosphere...

74
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,577
and only weak, localized magnetic fields.

75
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,750
NASA takes the solar flare threat seriously...

76
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:38,670
because it has already come close to killing Apollo astronauts.

77
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,633
The Apollo lunar landing crews were quite fortunate.

78
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:48,055
In 1972,in August, there was a major solar flare.

79
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,432
There was what they call the Great Solar Storm...

80
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,975
that happened to just take place...

81
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,603
in between the Apollo 16 mission in April...

82
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,646
and the Apollo 17 mission in December of that year.

83
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,359
Had that occurred while there was a crew...

84
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,819
on the surface of the Moon, they would have been dead.

85
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:10,577
The effects would be similar to certain people who died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki...

86
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,622
those who were not killed in the initial blast...

87
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:18,668
but were overwhelmed by the extreme radiation dosage within several seconds.

88
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,672
An astronaut caught in that situation will have little time to react.

89
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,970
A flood of deadly particles penetrates the body...

90
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:32,974
killing all of the astronaut's cells in a few brief moments.

91
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,523
So it's no surprise that space colonists...

92
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,483
will need to be constantly on alert.

93
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,652
We're going to need weather reports...

94
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,487
but they're going to be space weather reports.

95
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,490
We're going to need satellites monitoring the Sun...

96
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,492
giving us advance warning of flares.

97
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:55,288
The light from the Sun takes only eight minutes to reach the Moon.

98
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,249
Coming behind it would be the particles...

99
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,376
the lethal radiation.

100
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,131
You'd have minutes, half an hour, that sort of time frame...

101
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,258
before you wanted to really be in a shelter.

102
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,887
Such a storm might last for a couple of days.

103
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,601
One option for protection is living underground.

104
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,605
But don't let the barren terrain fool you.

105
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,027
The Moon and Mars are still active bodies...

106
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,115
where natural disasters like those seen on Earth can strike.

107
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:41,418
I'm here in the Mojave Desert in a cave created by a lava flow...

108
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,254
underneath five or six feet of rocks.

109
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:49,801
Well, being underground in a cave may be an option for habitation on the Moon or on Mars.

110
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,845
On the surface of the Moon and Mars...

111
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,682
there's radiation from the Sun, there's cosmic radiation.

112
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,601
On Mars, there's dust storms.

113
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,604
lf we're underground, we're safe from those hazards...

114
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,355
but we have other hazards.

115
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,571
Imagine being in this cave when there's quakes...

116
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,406
rocks falling down, crushing us, pinning us.

117
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,746
A Moon or Marsquake...

118
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,832
could also threaten an aboveground colony.

119
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,461
The Moon and Mars don't have tectonic plates...

120
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,632
like the ones that cause most of Earth's quakes and volcanic eruptions.

121
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,468
And there are no signs of active volcanoes.

122
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,555
But the Moon and Mars do have hot cores.

123
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:42,437
So as the pressure from that heat heads to the surface, the shaking starts.

124
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,944
And where there's quakes, there's often another disaster.

125
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:54,783
Just recently, we've seen a landslide occurring on Mars.

126
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,994
It was captured with the cameras in orbit.

127
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,829
So we know this does happen...

128
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,209
and that can be hard to predict.

129
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,752
We might put our base someplace...

130
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,087
which appears perfectly safe...

131
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,547
and then, a few years later...

132
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,799
realize that there's a landslide hazard.

133
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:18,765
Scientists are still unsure what started the 2008 landslide near the north pole of Mars.

134
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,685
It was in an icy area...

135
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,062
and researchers believe most of the slide material was ice.

136
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,151
That's just the type of place a colony might be located...

137
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,446
to take advantage of converting the ice to drinkable water.

138
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,538
Even a distant quake could still trigger a slide near a colony.

139
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:48,711
But what if a hidden fault line is running right under the buildings?

140
00:09:56,178 --> 00:10:00,473
In the future, space colonists living on the Moon or Mars...

141
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,225
will have plenty of threats to deal with...

142
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:09,065
including natural disasters like moonquakes and Marsquakes.

143
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,861
They're not active the way we're used to on Earth.

144
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,362
They're active in different ways...

145
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,323
and there may be unexpected ways...

146
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,533
that they could cause problems for us.

147
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,376
Since our current knowledge of these other worlds...

148
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,795
has literally only scratched the surface...

149
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,675
it's possible that in the future...

150
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,428
we could locate a base right over a fault line...

151
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,181
without realizing what's below.

152
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:44,934
And since weight is always an issue when carrying things into space...

153
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,687
the lightweight buildings could be quite vulnerable...

154
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,689
especially the outer layer.

155
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,568
lf anything happens to that protective layer...

156
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,279
that's trouble, very rapid trouble.

157
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,615
As the gases stream out of the habitat...

158
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,909
you've got to have a very efficient and quick procedure...

159
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:05,038
for getting into a spacesuit to survive that sort of decompression.

160
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,584
Death would not be instantaneous...

161
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:13,630
if oxygen and atmospheric pressure inside the colony are suddenly lost.

162
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,051
On Mars, there is a thin atmosphere...

163
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,471
although it's not breathable since it's mostly carbon dioxide.

164
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,142
On the Moon, there is only the vacuum of space.

165
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,939
But you'd still have a chance...

166
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,857
as we've learned from industrial accidents...

167
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,693
in vacuum chambers on Earth.

168
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,697
Exposure for maybe a minute or so is survivable.

169
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,284
Now, if you stay in a vacuum long enough...

170
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,703
there's not enough oxygen...

171
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:49,916
so nitrogen that's saturated in your blood and your tissues...

172
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,961
comes out of solution and causes bubbles.

173
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,838
That's decompression sickness.

174
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,133
And also, if you hold your breath...

175
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:01,845
you can get what they call pulmonary overinflation...

176
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,972
and your lung ruptures into your bloodstream...

177
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,307
and that's called an embolism.

178
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:13,606
So there's multiple factors that can result in death from exposure to the vacuum of space.

179
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,157
Then there's the temperature extremes.

180
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,452
Temperatures on the Moon...

181
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,705
go from a high of about 240 degrees Fahrenheit...

182
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,208
down to around 290 below.

183
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,256
Mars can get just as cold...

184
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,926
although you could get lucky and have a nice 70-degree summer day.

185
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,013
But without a breathable atmosphere...

186
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,850
going outside without a spacesuit is still a very bad idea.

187
00:12:53,522 --> 00:13:02,572
Another thing aboveground space colonists will have to be on the lookout for is meteors.

188
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,787
The craters on the Moon tell the story.

189
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,749
It's an easy target.

190
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,715
We're relatively comfortable down here...

191
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,550
underneath these layers of protection.

192
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,637
We've got a thick atmosphere...

193
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,847
which absorbs and burns up meteorites.

194
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,475
You go to the Moon, nothing.

195
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,062
There's no thick atmosphere.

196
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,899
We are exposed to everything that space is throwing at us.

197
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,402
If we go to Mars, there's a thin atmosphere...

198
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,404
but it's not anywhere near as good as the Earth's.

199
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:47,075
Again, we're exposed to what's coming in from space.

200
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:59,796
Smaller meteors that are only inches or fractions of an inch wide...

201
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,756
known as micrometeoroids...

202
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,093
will strike most often and without warning.

203
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,347
You're walking along the surface of Mars...

204
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,351
then something the size of a grain of sand comes slamming into your spacesuit.

205
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,895
That's going to be a serious problem.

206
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,190
It's going to be a loss of the pressure in the spacesuit.

207
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,360
It could mean loss of life of an astronaut.

208
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,280
When we have lots of people doing a lot of work on other worlds...

209
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,823
eventually that's going to happen.

210
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,741
That's the equivalent of a lightning strike...

211
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,994
a rare, possibly fatal event.

212
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:39,043
Micrometeoroids could also punch a hole through the wall of a colony building.

213
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,132
Like space stations, colonies will probably be built...

214
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,550
in a series of sections or modules.

215
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:54,514
And just as crews have had to seal off sections of a space station in an emergency,

216
00:14:55,557 --> 00:14:57,020
colonists will likely do the same.

217
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,986
Large meteors will hopefully be tracked...

218
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,906
so the colonists will know they're coming.

219
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,995
But evacuation might not do any good.

220
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:19,167
A nearby strike would still send out a deadly shockwave for miles.

221
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:27,383
A 10-foot wide meteor hits with the explosive equivalent of 6,000 to 8,000 tons of TNT.

222
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,848
Flying debris could also damage colony buildings beyond repair.

223
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,812
And anything approaching a direct hit...

224
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,944
there'll be little evidence that the colonists were ever there.

225
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:58,247
It's unlikely that colonists would live anywhere near one of Mars' volcanoes.

226
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:05,630
And the Moon probably hasn't seen volcanic activity in the last few billion years.

227
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,218
But even ancient remnants of volcanoes...

228
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,554
could still cause trouble for crews in vehicles.

229
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,977
Both the Moon and Mars show evidence of volcanic flows.

230
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,356
So we might expect to find there this sort of thing...

231
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,941
volcanic caves.

232
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,068
Imagine driving along the surface.

233
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,445
Come across one of these, you're not expecting it...

234
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,280
that could ruin your day. It could ruin your vehicle.

235
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,993
You could be at the bottom of this pit without any way to get up.

236
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,955
Even worse would be imagining one of these volcanic caves...

237
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,500
with a thin layer of volcanic rock on top of it.

238
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,628
You move across on top of that, it gives, and down you go.

239
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,757
But not all colony disasters will be so dramatic.

240
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:58,180
Simply running out of supplies is one of the greatest dangers.

241
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,310
Since the Moon is much closer...

242
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,438
emergency supplies could arrive in a matter of days.

243
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:13,573
With Mars, help is many months to years away...

244
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,908
depending on how the planets are aligned.

245
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,789
On Mars, if something goes wrong and you lose some supplies...

246
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:25,209
resupply from Earth can be two or three years away.

247
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,795
You think you've got enough to last...

248
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,673
you lose half of it to an accident, you're dead.

249
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,258
It's a real problem.

250
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,636
I think that means you're going to have to have more than what you need.

251
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,306
You're going to have to have enough for five, six years.

252
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,857
Living in space much closer to home...

253
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,985
on space stations and longer shuttle flights...

254
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,154
has already taught us a lot about the dangers of space.

255
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,746
And fire is space crew enemy number one.

256
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:08,086
The reason fire is such a threat is because spacecraft traditionally...

257
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,839
have higher levels of oxygen than the atmosphere...

258
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,634
certainly in higher concentrations under pressure.

259
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,304
They are also filled with electronic equipment.

260
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:22,850
Electronic equipment puts out heat, and often there are sparks and arcs.

261
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,977
It's a bad combination.

262
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,110
Luckily, designers have made it easier for crews to put out fires...

263
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:36,405
where all those miles of wire lurk behind the control panels.

264
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,243
This is a mockup of the space shuttle flight deck...

265
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,577
that we use for training of crews.

266
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,414
If you look at the various panels we have...

267
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:49,919
you will see small holes like this at various locations around it.

268
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,171
And these are for fire extinguishers...

269
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,674
so that if there is a fire behind one of these panels...

270
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,927
you can put an extinguisher in there to extinguish the fire.

271
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:05,143
Andrew Thomas knows a thing or two about fires in space.

272
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:10,022
While on the Mir Space Station in 1998,a fire suddenly broke out.

273
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,442
All the smoke was pumped right out into the cabin.

274
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,329
Crews hurtle through space in their enclosed craft...

275
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:29,125
desperate to maintain the Earth-like atmosphere inside.

276
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,547
Out here, fire is one of the biggest threats.

277
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,886
In 1998,NASA astronaut Andrew Thomas...

278
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,472
is onboard the Mir Space Station with two Russian cosmonauts.

279
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,185
Suddenly, a fire breaks out.

280
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,270
Ironically, the fire starts...

281
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,189
while cleaning what's known as an air scrubber...

282
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:55,151
one of the filters designed to remove exhaled carbon dioxide...

283
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,653
and other toxins from the space crew's environment.

284
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,240
All the smoke was pumped right out into the cabin.

285
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,785
And so, all of a sudden, the cabin in one part of the space station...

286
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,788
just became thick with a pall of smoke.

287
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,250
And, of course, all the air handlers...

288
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,294
then moved all that smoke around the spacecraft...

289
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,795
so within about two hours...

290
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,632
the entire spacecraft was completely filled with smoke.

291
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,135
So we had to just wait for the air handlers...

292
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,597
to scrub all of this contamination out.

293
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,182
And that took about two days.

294
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:33,397
And we all manifested symptoms of the toxicity of that environment.

295
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,983
When there's a lot of carbon monoxide at those levels...

296
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:40,821
you have nausea, a certain amount of confusion...

297
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,783
invariably a headache because you're oxygen-deprived.

298
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,410
It's just a very uncomfortable feeling.

299
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,997
The dangers of fire in space...

300
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,668
go beyond the fact that you can't open a window or call the fire department.

301
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,631
Fire actually behaves differently inside a spacecraft in zero gravity.

302
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,842
What we are seeing is a candle flame.

303
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:05,680
The bottom one is a candle in normal gravity.

304
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:11,185
As you can see the flame moves up because buoyancy...

305
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:15,273
pushes the hot gases around the flame up.

306
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,360
The top photograph is the same candle...

307
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,738
but in the absence of gravity.

308
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,409
Columbia SPACEHAB lock for the module.

309
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,746
The Mist burn will be initiated here in about 15 seconds.

310
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,583
The hot gases don't move up...

311
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:39,171
and what you have is a spherical flame.

312
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,715
There is the flame...

313
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:44,385
so here's the initial light off for Combustion Module Two.

314
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:50,975
So putting a smoke detector on the ceiling like we do on Earth...

315
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,685
doesn't work in space.

316
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:57,273
Instead, detectors are located next to small suction devices...

317
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,527
that draw air and any smoke or other toxins toward the detector.

318
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,616
To figure out just how dangerous fire is in space...

319
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,661
Professor Fernandez-Pello's team performs experiments...

320
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:14,248
in the University of California, Berkeley, combustion lab...

321
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:19,045
and on KC-135 aircraft in short bursts of zero g.

322
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,092
In theory, fires in zero gravity should be less intense...

323
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,261
because the hot gases don't rise...

324
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,930
which means cool air isn't drawn in at the base...

325
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,640
to keep feeding the flames.

326
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:36,479
But they're finding that the reality inside a spacecraft is more dangerous.

327
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:41,233
Air conditioning systems create small air currents.

328
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:45,780
Those currents bring fresh air or, in this case, fuel to the fire.

329
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:49,283
At the same time, the low airflow and lack of gravity...

330
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,077
don't remove the heat as quickly as on Earth.

331
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,246
The result...

332
00:22:54,956 --> 00:23:02,838
These type of fires are hotter and more dangerous than in normal gravity.

333
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,469
And fire is likely to become even more of a safety hazard...

334
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:13,557
inside the new Aries/Orion spacecraft being designed to replace the shuttle.

335
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,143
What they've decided to do...

336
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,687
was to reduce the pressure and increase the oxygen.

337
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,190
And by doing this, they reduced the preparation time...

338
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:26,028
that it takes for the astronauts to go from the vehicle to outside of the vehicle.

339
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:32,076
So what we're doing is we're testing materials at that proposed environment.

340
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:36,414
We've learned that for the environment that they've chosen...

341
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,874
for their next generation of vehicles...

342
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:43,421
things actually ignite about 20 percent faster than they would in the current environment.

343
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:53,681
The combination of high oxygen content and low airflow...

344
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:58,227
means just about anything can catch fire, even metal.

345
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,859
In a worst-case future scenario...

346
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:09,321
a space station crew is unable to quickly extinguish a fire.

347
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:13,075
It grows too fast to seal off in a separate module.

348
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,787
Even if they put on emergency oxygen masks...

349
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,748
the heat of the flames will likely kill them.

350
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,795
And if they're somehow able to survive the flames...

351
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,840
the filtering system is completely overloaded.

352
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:33,345
They are left to die in a toxic stew from smoke inhalation.

353
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,893
The best chance of survival with an out-of-control fire...

354
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:42,730
is to abandon ship and return in a re-entry capsule...

355
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,231
if one is available.

356
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:48,652
That was the key to the survival of the crew of Apollo 13.

357
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,573
April 11,1970.

358
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,409
The three-man crew launches into space.

359
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,789
Two days later, on their way to the Moon...

360
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,586
an oxygen tank suddenly explodes.

361
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,048
The explosion causes a substantial loss of oxygen...

362
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,092
and damages the Service Module's electrical system.

363
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,679
The crew is forced to live in the cramped lunar capsule.

364
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:24,396
Apollo 13 is the classic case of the failure that doesn't kill you.

365
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,649
It happened at the right time.

366
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,693
It happened when they were on their way to the Moon...

367
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:33,489
so they could use the Lunar Module as a lifeboat...

368
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,616
and get back to Earth.

369
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,202
Had the same problem occurred after the lunar landing...

370
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,455
when Lovell, Swigert, and Haise were on their way back to Earth...

371
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,540
there would've been nothing they could do.

372
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,832
They would've been dead.

373
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:53,801
The threat of fire is especially high inside spacesuits.

374
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:58,556
During spacewalks, also known as EVAs or extra-vehicular activity...

375
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,975
the spacesuits need to be kept at low pressures.

376
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,563
Working at a fraction of Earth's atmosphere...

377
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,523
is the key to flexibility.

378
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,653
If you had a spacesuit that was at one atmosphere...

379
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,239
you would be like, basically, in a balloon...

380
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,657
and you couldn't move.

381
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:23,497
With low pressure, just like a climber in the thin atmosphere of Mount Everest...

382
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,252
astronauts need to breathe highly flammable 100 percent oxygen.

383
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,551
This is an arm from the spacesuit.

384
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:39,346
It was burned up in a fire in 1980 at Johnson Space Center...

385
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,223
just doing some checkout tests...

386
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,892
pressurizing the system with the two different oxygen sources...

387
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:49,732
and when this fire occurred, it was, you know, quite a shock.

388
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,900
People were standing nearby it...

389
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,903
and someone was supposed to be in the suit the next day...

390
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,614
for a manned test.

391
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,449
And it could've been a fatal fire.

392
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:03,370
Even as it is, this suit is worth, at the time, $3. 1 million.

393
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:07,124
And it also took NASA $20 million to recover from this fire...

394
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,667
in terms of redesigning the suit.

395
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:14,882
Extra-vehicular activity is dangerous for many other reasons as well.

396
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:19,386
In fact, the world's first spacewalk almost ended in disaster.

397
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,098
Alexei Leonov did the first spacewalk...

398
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,142
that any human did in 1965.

399
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,899
But in the rush to accomplish that space spectacular...

400
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,817
and thereby beat the Americans...

401
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,238
the Soviets took some shortcuts on the safety of the cosmonaut...

402
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,616
and so he blew up like the Michelin Man.

403
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,494
The suit became rigid.

404
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,412
It couldn't handle the pressure differences...

405
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:50,125
between the breathable atmosphere inside and the vacuum of space.

406
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,461
The problem is, is you've got a spacecraft...

407
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:56,340
in the Soyuz capsule that he was flying, that's very small...

408
00:27:56,383 --> 00:28:00,719
and the hatch for it is even smaller.

409
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,305
Ultimately, his response was to let a little bit of the air out...

410
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,435
and just deflate the thing enough...

411
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,938
so that he can crawl back in through the hatch.

412
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,524
But he will tell you that to this day...

413
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,818
that he wasn't sure he'd be able to make it.

414
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:22,241
An astronaut having, like Leonov, to let the pressure out...

415
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,494
in order to be able to maneuver in it is in the same situation...

416
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:30,374
as a diver ascending from deep water too quickly.

417
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:34,378
Nitrogen bubbles will form in your bloodstream...

418
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,880
and not only be painful, they'll kill you.

419
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:40,968
And during EVAs, a simple thing, such as an unsecured tether...

420
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,764
or a misfiring emergency thruster, can also spell disaster.

421
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,104
Being outside of a spacecraft on a spacewalk...

422
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,524
is the most dangerous thing an astronaut in orbit can do.

423
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,735
One false move can be deadly...

424
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:01,530
especially if that false move takes you away from the spacecraft.

425
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,032
There was an instance...

426
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,535
on one of the Russian space stations, the Salyut...

427
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:10,038
where one of the crew members was not tethered...

428
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:14,835
and he was in the airlock area, watching the other crew member...

429
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,253
and he slowly started to drift out...

430
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,339
and the other cosmonaut saw him and grabbed him.

431
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,675
An untethered person in space...

432
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:25,512
without appropriate propulsion system to get back...

433
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,556
would be very, very serious.

434
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,641
I mean, basically, you're lost at sea.

435
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,938
Even with a propulsion system, it can fail...

436
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,357
or run out of its limited propellant supply...

437
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,319
before the astronaut reaches safety.

438
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,572
The astronaut will simply keep floating off into space.

439
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:48,035
The International Space Station is unable to chase someone down.

440
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,204
And if the shuttle were docked...

441
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:53,415
it would take too long to undock and mount a rescue.

442
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,752
In this nightmare scenario...

443
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,506
the astronaut will likely have several hours of oxygen remaining...

444
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,508
to contemplate the end.

445
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:07,262
As long as the suit is intact, pressure will not be an issue.

446
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,097
Either the oxygen will run out...

447
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,353
or the system, which removes exhaled carbon dioxide will stop working.

448
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:17,147
Either way, the astronaut will suffocate...

449
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,108
and continue floating into the emptiness of space.

450
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,906
The same micrometeoroids that can devastate space colonies...

451
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:31,203
also pose a lethal threat to spacewalks and entire spacecraft.

452
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,413
Plus, in low-Earth orbit...

453
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:37,960
these rocky little gremlins have company: space junk.

454
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,546
And all of these things are racing around...

455
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,757
at over 22,000 miles an hour.

456
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,636
At these speeds, objects that are only a fraction of an inch wide...

457
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,096
can be deadly.

458
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,182
A micrometeoroid flying through space...

459
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,476
is a lot like a golf ball flying through the air...

460
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,602
with these differences:

461
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,605
the micrometeoroid is much, much smaller.

462
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,858
And because it travels at hypervelocity...

463
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,151
it's far more destructive when it hits.

464
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,283
lf a micrometeoroid hits your spacesuit...

465
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,450
it's going to put a hole in it.

466
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:14,705
You don't have reach or the ability to patch or fix it.

467
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:19,626
Unless you've got a fellow astronaut right there...

468
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:20,669
you're going to die.

469
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,963
Your air is going to leak out fairly quickly.

470
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,006
It's going to gush out.

471
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,675
Your blood's going to boil. That's going to be it.

472
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,137
And what causes blood to boil?

473
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:33,807
Well, in space, boiling blood has nothing to do with heat.

474
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,227
It's all about the sudden lack of atmospheric pressure.

475
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,190
The idea that blood boils is really a misnomer.

476
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:46,069
The liquid in your body goes from a liquid state to a gaseous state.

477
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,949
There have been many tales about what happens to an unprotected person in outer space.

478
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,411
Here's the real story.

479
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:58,540
As the vacuum of space fills the spacewalker's leaking suit...

480
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,960
the liquid parts of the tongue and eyes begin to bubble...

481
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,254
along with all of the saliva, internal fluids, and blood.

482
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,133
As the blood turns to gas...

483
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:12,679
oxygen no longer travels to the brain or anywhere else.

484
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,682
The brain shuts down within about 15 seconds...

485
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,310
leaving the victim unconscious.

486
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:21,228
Soon after, the rest of the cells in the body die.

487
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,859
Temperature extremes could also play a role...

488
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:30,364
since the sunlit areas of space reach 250 degrees Fahrenheit...

489
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,866
and the shaded areas quickly plummet...

490
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,494
to 250 degrees below zero.

491
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:42,501
And just how big a hole is too big for a spacesuit?

492
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,045
You're really asking a very small amount of material...

493
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,256
to stop a particle that could be coming in at seven kilometers per second.

494
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,717
You can see the entry hole from the test...

495
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,095
and it has many, many layers...

496
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,889
ending with what's called the bladder...

497
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,975
and this is a pressure-retaining layer.

498
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,352
That's about a two to three-millimeter hole.

499
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:05,941
A four-millimeter for an EVA suit in the soft goods, this material would be considered catastrophic.

500
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,236
Luckily, no one in space has ever suffered this fate.

501
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:16,910
Impacts can also cause trouble in sneakier ways.

502
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,955
So NASA goes to great lengths to simulate different types...

503
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,291
of micrometeoroid damage down on Earth.

504
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,504
Researchers inside the Hypervelocity Building...

505
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:30,257
of the White Sands test facility in New Mexico...

506
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:34,428
create impacts using compressed hydrogen gas guns.

507
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,972
These guns definitely bring the heat...

508
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,933
shooting objects up to 19,000 miles per hour...

509
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:43,520
at shuttle and space station parts to assess the damage.

510
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:48,525
At that velocity, you can get from Los Angeles to New York...

511
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,193
in about eight minutes.

512
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,196
The testing that we're going to perform today...

513
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:57,451
is on an International Space Station handle that the astronauts use...

514
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,453
on the outside of the space station...

515
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:03,040
in order to transverse around the space station safely.

516
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,792
Several astronauts have cut their gloves severely.

517
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,461
This is a great concern to NASA...

518
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,505
because when they designed the space station...

519
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,967
they are very careful to eliminate all sharp edges...

520
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,927
because you don't want something snagging...

521
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,512
the astronauts' spacesuits...

522
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,348
and creating a hole and ending a mission.

523
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,853
Technicians mount the handle in the target chamber...

524
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:29,107
place the tiny 1/32-of-an-inch-wide projectile within a holder...

525
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,234
that will disintegrate once fired...

526
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,945
then add gunpowder to the breech.

527
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,785
We take gunpowder and propel a piston...

528
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:44,372
which compresses hydrogen gas up to about 100,000 PSI.

529
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:48,460
It's that highly compressed gas that accelerates the projectiles...

530
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,338
from zero to 19,000 miles per hour.

531
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,673
We use three different types of cameras.

532
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:58,011
One takes a snapshot, another one takes a film...

533
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,680
and the third type is a digital camera...

534
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:04,726
which takes 16 frames at 200 million frames per second.

535
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:11,274
The technicians retreat behind a blast shield and prepare to fire.

536
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,361
The chamber is cleared of oxygen and other gases...

537
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,030
to simulate the vacuum of outer space.

538
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,538
Now the moment of truth.

539
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,625
How much damage did this simulated micrometeoroid cause?

540
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,920
Even though it is a small impact...

541
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:36,049
there's enough of a lip with enough structure...

542
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:40,387
so that an astronaut could catch their glove on such a lip...

543
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,889
and cause a tear in their glove.

544
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,227
And if a projectile only 1/32 of an inch wide...

545
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,229
can cause this type of damage...

546
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,315
you won't believe what a larger object can do.

547
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,446
At the NASA White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico...

548
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:02,909
researchers load small projectiles into huge guns.

549
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:07,789
The projectiles simulate micrometeoroids and space junk.

550
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:12,669
They slam into spacecraft parts at up to 19,000 miles an hour...

551
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,379
creating disasters on Earth...

552
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,090
to better understand disasters in space.

553
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,510
At such incredibly high speeds...

554
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:24,472
a very small object can cause very big trouble.

555
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,562
I'm standing inside of our largest target chamber of our one-inch gun.

556
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,814
The gun is 175 feet long...

557
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:36,359
and can launch up to a 3/4-inch-sized projectile.

558
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,777
I'm holding a target...

559
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,405
that was impacted with a 5/8-inch projectile.

560
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,283
And as you can see, this is the entry hole...

561
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,994
and it went all the way through the test article.

562
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:50,665
An impact of this size would be a catastrophic event in space.

563
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,465
The only hope the International Space Station crew...

564
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:02,427
would have for survival is to put on emergency breathing masks...

565
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,346
and head to the reentry capsule.

566
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:08,892
An object less than an inch wide would have forced them to abandon...

567
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,478
this multi-billion-dollar facility.

568
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,525
That type of scenario is the reason why...

569
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:22,322
crews are constantly adding extra layers of protection to the outside of the space station.

570
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:30,204
For another type of space collision, we have only ourselves to blame.

571
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:34,000
In 1997,a Russian cosmonaut...

572
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,419
had trouble guiding an unmanned cargo craft...

573
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:39,338
to its docking point with the Mir Space Station.

574
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,675
Now, we know in aviation...

575
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,970
that 70 percent of the accidents are human-related.

576
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,846
So it wouldn't surprise you to think...

577
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:54,604
that humans have also a big role in accidents and mishaps in space.

578
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,691
The Mir collision actually was because...

579
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:03,655
a crew member complained that he wasn't trained enough to do the rendezvous...

580
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:07,575
and the ground control team said, " Well, you have to do it anyway. "

581
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,372
The hit occurred.

582
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,749
It caused a leak in the cabin pressure...

583
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,210
so now they started to lose cabin pressure.

584
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,380
And then the space station started to tumble.

585
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,215
It was like pool balls.

586
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,551
One hits another, it causes it to move.

587
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,594
So even a minor thing...

588
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,388
just the control of a rendezvous and docking...

589
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,974
could have almost catastrophic consequence.

590
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,478
But the disasters that have happened in space...

591
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:40,859
still pale in comparison to the disasters of getting into space and returning.

592
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:45,071
There is a saying that the first 50 miles and the last 50 miles...

593
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:48,116
are the most dangerous part of any mission.

594
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,161
The 1986 Challenger launch disaster...

595
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:56,333
and the 2003 Columbia re-entry tragedy make that clear.

596
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,755
But if we're ever going to travel beyond our solar system...

597
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:05,382
we're going to need to move beyond our current rocket technology.

598
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,930
One possibility that both thrills and terrifies...

599
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,516
is known as an antimatter engine.

600
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,811
Inside massive particle accelerators...

601
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:20,607
scientists have created minute amounts of antimatter...

602
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,691
which is made of atoms...

603
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:25,111
that have the opposite charges of normal atoms.

604
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,613
So with antimatter...

605
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:30,658
the electrons are positive and the protons are negative.

606
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,453
When matter and antimatter come into contact...

607
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,121
they annihilate each other...

608
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:38,208
releasing tremendous amounts of energy.

609
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:44,130
Antimatter engines have a 100 percent conversion rate of matter into energy.

610
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,257
Realize that even an atomic bomb...

611
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,551
is only one percent efficient.

612
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:54,265
Only one percent of the mass of an atomic bomb is converted to energy.

613
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,809
In an antimatter engine...

614
00:39:55,851 --> 00:40:00,605
we're talking about nearly 100 percent of the mass converted into energy.

615
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,901
It is, for the next century, the propulsion system of choice.

616
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,027
But there's a problem.

617
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,947
A teaspoon of antimatter...

618
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:12,575
might be able to propel us across the solar system...

619
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,702
but that same teaspoon...

620
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:18,331
also has the power to destroy an entire city.

621
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,835
And once a spacecraft is out in deep space...

622
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:26,214
simple accidents can suddenly tip the balance from life to death.

623
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,677
As we venture to Mars and beyond...

624
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,346
with journeys lasting years at a time...

625
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,849
the chances of becoming stranded in space...

626
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,559
will become much greater.

627
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,854
For example, on a flight to Mars...

628
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,690
what if a micrometeoroid punches an oxygen tank?

629
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:46,818
What if you just are simply running out of breathable air?

630
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:47,861
There is nothing you can do.

631
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,572
You can die graciously is what you can do...

632
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,865
however long it takes.

633
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,743
Another source of disasters...

634
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,371
especially with journeys measured in years...

635
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:01,082
is something that many people overlook.

636
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:06,045
One thing we forget is our fellow man...

637
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,922
our fellow astronauts.

638
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,301
lf you're cooped up in this tiny, little space capsule...

639
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:14,053
for, let's say, a year at a time going to Mars...

640
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:18,433
or years going into deep space, you can go crazy.

641
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,560
You can get claustrophobic.

642
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,812
The guy next door could really get on your nerves...

643
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,106
and you want to strangle him after a certain point.

644
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,028
Although the incidents aren't highly publicized...

645
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,198
crew members have had problems getting along in the past...

646
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,866
with dangerous results.

647
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:41,039
There was at least one Soviet space station crew in the 1970s...

648
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:44,375
that didn't get along pretty famously...

649
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,628
and actually supposedly had a fistfight.

650
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,840
These stresses are going to manifest themselves on these long-duration missions.

651
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,676
Anybody who thinks they aren't is fooling himself.

652
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,389
And to make things even more interesting...

653
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:03,102
Russian cosmonauts supposedly have firearms stowed onboard...

654
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:07,941
as a precaution after an extremely off-course landing in 1965.

655
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:12,278
The crew landed up in the woods in Siberia...

656
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,988
and were there for about three days...

657
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:18,117
and they had to fight off wolves until they were rescued.

658
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,371
After that particular mission, the Soviets decided...

659
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,706
that they were going to put a sawed-off shotgun...

660
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,458
in every Soyuz capsule...

661
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,710
in case something like that happened again.

662
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:32,215
The cosmonauts are now rumored to have handguns...

663
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,883
stored in emergency kits.

664
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:39,472
But no one is eager to offer any official details of guns in space.

665
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,350
And the risk of having a weapon aboard...

666
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,936
isn't just a concern if tempers flare.

667
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,732
There is actually a documented case...

668
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:55,780
of a payload specialist, who flew on a shuttle flight...

669
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,491
whose experiment failed...

670
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,035
and he spent his whole life getting this experiment ready...

671
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:06,833
it failed, and he actually talked about killing himself.

672
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:10,253
And the crew themselves actually tried to protect him...

673
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:14,090
and guarded the hatch so he wouldn't kill them.

674
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:20,221
Even with all of the space travel lessons learned so far...

675
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,015
one thing is clear:

676
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:26,686
nothing can completely prevent disasters from striking in the future.

677
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,023
If we're going to continue human space flight...

678
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,357
we have to accept the risk...

679
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,986
because it is a very dangerous occupation.

680
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,571
But we have to manage the risk...

681
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,408
and that's going to require good technical people and good leadership.

682
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,913
But just as surely as disasters will strike...

683
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,248
there is another certainty...

684
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,917
when it comes to manned space exploration.

685
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,631
I think we have a gene...

686
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,050
a gene for exploration...

687
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,427
a gene for discovery.

688
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,679
Not only is it good for our evolution...

689
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:05,642
because we find new avenues to reproduce and to colonize...

690
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:09,103
but I think it's also inside the spirit of human beings...

691
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,731
to want to know what's out there.

692
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:15,526
Is it possible to reach areas that we've never been before?

693
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:16,736
And the thrill...

694
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:21,616
the thrill of being the first person to explore new terrain...

695
00:44:22,179 --> 00:44:24,616
That's fantastic.

696
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:28,616
