67
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,083
他小时候脑袋被驴踢了
He was kicked in the head as a child.

好吧 我要你们都离开
Okay, I'm just gonna have you all exit the building.

71
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,130

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,966
你就留这么点小费？

86
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,810
是的 我就这样 我的天啊
- Yes, I did.  - Oh, my God.

87
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,807
古人怎么云的？
How'd you say it?

88
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,490
永远不要打劫一家
Never rob a bank across from the diner

89
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,846
正对一家牛皮哄哄的甜甜圈店的银行
with the best doughnuts in three counties?

90
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,967
就是这句
That's correct.

91
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,845
双 龙 出 手

92
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,786
（一周前）

93
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,786
（墨西哥 索诺拉省）

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,686
鲍比 帕皮在马棚

95
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,844
为什么你不去吃点东西？
Why don't you get somethin' to eat?

96

101
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,166
鲍比

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,851
- 等在这  - 好吧

104
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,081
小托罗
Little Toro.

105
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,561
来得早不如来得巧啊
Oh, well, you move your feet, you lose your seat, right?

106
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,688
- 已经掉了脑袋了  - 没错
- Lose your head, too.  - That's correct.

107

那么 小托罗在哪呢？
So, where is Little Toro?

108
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,768
你刚把他丢下面了
Alllí, where you put him.

109
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,723
- 在这下面？  - 下面就是
- Aqui?  - Allí.

110
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,811
我们玩色子吧
Let's play some dominoes.

111
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,449
- 帕皮准备好见他了  - 好的

帕皮格力高！
Papi Greco!

113
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,725
“人尽皆知”的鲍比
"I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

114
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,887
是我
That's correct.

115
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,008
出手迅猛又坚若磐石的1963年生人
Quick, an ostrich, a tank of ether, a '63 Impala convertible.

116
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,761
是1964年的
Make it a '64.

117
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,604
来到我的地盘
My side of the border.

118
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,886
我还真认识那家伙
I know a guy.

119
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,530
我怎么跟你形容的？ 他从不说“不” 也不说“或许”
What did I tell you? He never says no, never says maybe,

120
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,723
从不说“我看着办”
never says, "I'll see what I can do."

121
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,801
好公牛
Nice bull.

122
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,407
我希望它是一头好种牛
I hope he's a good breeder.

123
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,205
小托罗真丢脸
That's a shame about Little Toro.

124
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,284
朱里奥抓到他拿回扣
Julio caught him skimming.

125
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,324
那不像小托罗的作风
That don't sound like Little Toro.

126
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,523
那是给我的？ 没错
Is that for me? That's correct.

127
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,491
所有人都会中饱私囊 人之本性
Everybody skims a little cream. It's human nature.

128
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,882
但熟人也不可以姑息
Just 'cause it's human don't mean you let it go.

129
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,925
很正的线条 很正的色彩
Nice lines. Good color.

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,967
那当然
That's right.

00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,690
果然有点本事
He knows a guy.

132
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,721
你有什么给我？
What you got for me?

00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,120
现金
Cash.

134
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,206
现金？
Cash?

135
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,929
应该给我10万美元成交
Supposed to be givin' me 100,000 to deal.

136
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,923
为什么不给我10万美元的可卡因
Why didn't you give me $100,000 worth of cocaine?

137
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,044
可卡因在哪？
Where's the cocaine?

138
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,565
我的客户想要可卡因
My buyer wants cocaine.

139
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,210
那么就让他拿钱去买可卡因吧
So let him buy cocaine.

140
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,011
他只想买可卡因
That's what he's tryin' to do. He's trying to buy cocaine.

141
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,560
我告诉他我有熟人 所以我就来找你了
I told him I knew a guy, therefore I come to you.

142
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,563
你就是我的 熟人 我也这么告诉过他
You the guy I know. That's why I told him.

143
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,041
那把护照拿回去吧
So take back the passports.

144
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,203
自小托罗事件后 我们不再接受任何新客户
After Little Toro, we're not takin' on any new customers.

145
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,609
好吧 无意冒犯 但是我不是新客户
Well, no disrespect, but I ain't no new customer.

146
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,126
我们交易有好一阵子了
You been dealin' with me for a long time.

147
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,605
护照你留着
You keep the passports.

148
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,646
钱也留着
Keep the money, too.

149
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,688
准备好可卡因的时候再给我
When you're ready to give me the product, give me the product.

150
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,886
在这之前…
Till then...

151
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,400
算你欠我的
You owe me.

152
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,051
这不公平 老兄
It's not very sporting, man.

153
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,566
至少让鸡有机会开枪反击
At least give the chickens a chance to shoot back.

154
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,245
老兄 我只是说 如果是我 我不会杀一个没有抵抗力的动物
Hey, man, I'm just sayin'. If I'm gonna kill a defenseless animal,

155
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,886
我尊重它作为烤肉的牺牲
I'm gonna honor its sacrifice by grilling it into some tasty barbecue.

156
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,689
再说就算击中一泡尿距离的鸡
What I'm not gonna do is torture it

157
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,491
也证明不了什么
just to prove I can't hit anything further away than my own pecker.

158
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,171
你的搭档真是一个吵闹的狗啊
- Your cuate's a real junkyard dog.  - Mmm.

159
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:22,023
你们是在哪里合伙的？

160
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:25,748
某天晚上我丢给他一根骨头 丫就跟我回家了

161
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,565
嘿 牛仔 最帅的那个
Hey, cowboy. You, the pretty one.

162
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,849
古人云 “你长了一张只有你妈才会喜欢的脸”
You ever hear the expression, "You got a face only a mother can love"?

163
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,164
但那句不适合你 你比恶魔还要丑
That don't apply to you. You are uglier than the devil's asshole itself.

164
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,327
史迪格！
Stig!

165
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,801
你在干什么？
What are you doin'?

166
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,928
老兄 他们在折磨小鸡们
They're torturing chickens, man.

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,331
你吃的是什么？
What are you eatin'?

168
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,761
鸡腿
A chicken.

169
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,171
这不一样 好吗？
Come here. It's not the same thing, okay?

170
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,720
看到桌子边的那个袋子了吗？
See that bag over there by the table?

171
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,165
自助餐桌旁边的土豆沙拉边的
Buffet table next to the potato salad.

172
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,970
对 有个保龄球包 干嘛的？
Yeah, the bowling bag. What about it?

173
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,168
小托罗的头在那个包里
Little Tom's head is in that bag.

174
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,530
- 我勒个擦  - 没错
- Bullshit.  - Yeah.

175
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,563
这太乱了 老兄
You know what? That's fucked up, man.

176
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,251
我们走吧
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's go. Okay? Come on, let's go.

177
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,488
用英语说话 你TMD
Say it in English, you goat fuck.

178
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,527
吞我个鸡巴
Suck my chicken.

179
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,921
那话从你嘴里出来真好笑 肥仔
That's funny comin' from you, fat boy.

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,445
从你一生下来你就看不到你老二
You ain't seen your pecker since you were a baby.

181
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,130
就算使劲压你的肚脐
Just 'cause you put your finger in your belly button

182
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,806
有便便流出来 你就觉得那是你的菊花了
and brown shit comes out don't mean it's your asshole.

183
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,809
- 你说什么？  - 看我的 老兄
- What did you say?  - Don't worry about it, man.

184
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,328
现在把鸡们弄出来 然后弄成该死的烤肉
Now dig 'em up and make some damn barbecue.

185
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,046
再见 小鸡
Bye, chica.

186
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,131
你刚才对着他眨眼吗？
Did you just wink at him?

187
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,765
我对他眨眼了 因为现在他是我的婊子了
I did wink at him, 'cause he's my bitch now.

188
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,448
- 射得好  - 谢谢
- That's good shootin'.  - Gracias.

189
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,202
小托罗没对任何人行过不义 老兄
You know, Little Toro never did nothin' to nobody, man.

190
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,085
我们应该偷帕皮在特雷司·克鲁塞斯银行的藏匿物
We should rip off Papi's stash at the Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

191
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,004
你知道 帕皮的小弟每两周
You know, Papi's guy delivers a briefcase

192
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,809
会把装满钱的箱子放到特雷司·克鲁塞斯银行
full of money to Tres Cruces every two weeks.

193
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,729
这肯定至少有300万
That's gotta add up to, what, like three million at least.

194
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,203
如果帕皮知道是我们抢了特雷司·克鲁塞斯银行
If Papi knew we were even talkin' about rippin' off Tres Cruces,

195
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,204
那将是我们的脑袋被装到包里 挨着土豆沙拉
it would be our heads in that bag next to the potato salad.

196
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,330
不可能 我们俩的脑袋放不下 包太小了
No way. Our two heads would never fit in a bag that small.

197
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,890
好了 老兄 让我们去抢劫银行吧
Come on, man, let's hit the bank.

198
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,928
小托罗曾是你的朋友 也是我的朋友
Little Toro was your friend. He was my friend.

199
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,809
- 所以？ - 你说所以什么意思？
- So?  - What do you mean "so"?

200
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,043
万一是我呢？ 如果是我的头被帕皮锯掉呢？
What if it was me? What if it was my head Papi ran through the saw mill?

201
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,730
- 你不会步他后尘的？ - 不会
- You wouldn't come after him?  - Nope.

202
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,526
- 你不会杀了他？ - 不会
- You wouldn't kill him?  - Nope.

203
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,921
他居然对你这么干 是我的话就杀了他 知道为什么要杀他？
Shit, man, he did that to you, I'd kill him. You know why I'd kill him?

204
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,485
因为你是我的人 这是规则
Because you're my people and there's a code.

205
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,085
第一没有规则
There is no code, first of all.

206
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,401
你想做什么就做什么 自己考虑后果
You do whatever you gotta do, whatever it takes.

207
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,720
第二呢？
And second?

208
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,770
第二 我们不是公民 因为你不是墨西哥人
Right, we're not people 'cause you don't have people.

209
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,046
没错
That's correct.

210
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,764
来墨西哥的目的是什么？
Purpose for your visit to Mexico?

211
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,967
捕猎鹌鹑
Quail hunting.

212
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,811
我蒂巴城的婶婶心脏病发作 所以我们只能赶紧回家
My aunt in Tuba City had a heart attack so we cut our trip short.

213
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,046
蒂巴城？
Tuba City?

214
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,326
挨着奥德萨市
It's near Odessa.

215
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,646
地方不错？
Nice place?

216
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,722
藏污纳垢之处 但是她是我最爱的婶婶
Hellhole, but she's my favorite aunt.

217
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,482
- 不许动 把手举起来  - 该死
- Don't move. Let me see your hands.  - Oh, shit.

218
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,410
- 交代你们的行程  - 律师
- Tell us about your trip.  - Lawyer.

219
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,606
- 有什么大交易  - 律师
- What's the big deal?  - Lawyer.

220
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,648
你去过索诺拉 对吗？
You were down in Sonora, weren't you?

221
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,764
你不会认为杰赛普探员和缉毒署会不认识你和帕皮格力高吧？
You don't think Agent Jessup and the DEA know about you and Papi Greco?

222
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,041
律师 律师
Lawyer. Lawyer.

223
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,087
他们知道你去了他的农场
They know you were at his ranch.

224
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,321
我知道我需要一名律师
I know I need a lawyer.

225
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,650
跟瑞斯探员谈谈帕皮格力高
Tell Agent Rees about Papi Greco.

226
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,843
- 谁？  - 帕皮格力高
- Who?  - Papi Greco.

227
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,845
那是谁？ 墨西哥圣诞老人还是别的什么？
Well, who's that? Some Mexican Santa Claus or something?

228
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,289
得了 史迪格先生
Come on, Mr. Stigman.

229
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,320
我认为你最好是合作
I think it's in your best interest to cooperate.

230
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,480
别再玩弄愚蠢的把戏了 行不行？
You need to stop playin' the stupid card, all right?

231
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,728
好的 女士 你想怎样我配合就是
Well, ma'am, it's my intent to cooperate with whatever you need.

232
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,802
作为美国人 我知道你在尽忠尽责
I mean, as an American, I know you're just doin' your job,

233
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,928
有时我这种无辜的人会被误抓
and sometimes innocent folks like me get caught up in the system.

234
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,446
好比航空公司也不是故意丢掉你行李的 对吗？
It's like the airlines. They don't lose your luggage on purpose, right?

235
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,329
但轮到谁谁倒霉
But everybody takes it so damn personal.

236
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,085
好吧 史迪格先生 你想玩游戏吗？
Come on, Mr. Stigman. So you wanna play games?

237
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,844
你说呢？
Well, what'd you have in mind?

238
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,369
- 你想帮自己吗？  - 是的
- Do you wanna help yourself?  - Yes.

239
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,881
必须当着他的面？
Do I have to do it in front of him?

240
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,887
好吧 我们谈完了 谢谢你 史迪格先生
All right, we're done here. Thank you, Mr. Stigman.

241
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,485
- 你要走了？  - 对
- You gonna leave?  - Oh, yes.

242
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,205
天啊
Oh, my God.

243
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,647
跟她共事你还怎么能集中注意力 老兄？
How do you concentrate workin' with her, man?

244
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,721
趁谈话的功夫 5个探员把你的车锯成两半了
Five border agents are rippin' apart your car as we speak.

245
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,041
他们什么都不会找到
They ain't gonna find anything.

246
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,490
你把可卡因藏哪儿了？
Where'd you hide the cocaine?

247
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,649
- 他们能听到我们说话？  - 不
- Can they hear us?  - No.

248
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,251
- 他们能看到我们？  - 不
- Can they see us?  - No.

249
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,726
好吧
Okay.

250
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,245
没有可卡因
There was no cocaine.

251
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,570
- 你到那里做了笔交易  - 是的
- You had a deal in place.  - Right.

252
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,120
500本护照换可卡因
Five hundred passports in return for cocaine.

253
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,406
没错
Right.

254
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,800
嘿 鲍比
Hey, Bobby.

255
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,881
你好 戴布
How you doin', Deb?

256
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,249
你搭档史迪格是块料子
Good. Man, your boy Stig's a piece of work.

257
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,925
他对你眨眼了 对吗？
He winked at you, didn't he?

258
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,241
你怎么知道
How'd you know?

259
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,490
鲍比没有拿到可卡因
Bobby didn't get the cocaine.

260
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,051
什么？ 发生什么事了？
What? What happened?

261
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,331
帕皮要给我现金 我跟他说不行
Papi offered me cash. I told him no.

262
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,004
我跟他说先拿着护照
I told him to keep the passports,

263
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,008
所以最后他一定会给可卡因
so, eventually, he's gotta come up with the cocaine.

264
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,925
你不是去替换那个谁 小托罗？
What about this guy you said you could flip? Little Toro?

265
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,288
我就快搞定了
I got him. It's real close.

266
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,723
我真弄不明白你
I don't know who you are anymore.

267
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,646
就像…
It's like...

268
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,884
胳膊不听大脑的使唤
It's like you're out on this limb.

269
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,162
因为沉迷于他们的世界太久
And you've been out there way too long.

270
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,924
你什么意思？
And you're sayin' that to say what?

271
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,684
我不想参加自己人的葬礼
I don't like goin' to the funerals of my own men.

272
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,207
那就别来 老大 别来
Well, then don't come, boss. Don't come.

273
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,407
好吗？
Okay?

274
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,364
我花了生命中的三年
I spent the last three years of my life

275
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,766
用我自己的方式慢慢的匍匐靠近
crawlin' through a Mexican sewer

276
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,241
帕皮格力高的组织
tryin' to work my way up the line to get next to Papi Greco.

277
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,044
你不能现在让我退出
You can't take me off this now.

278
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,247
杰赛普 他就快完了
Jessup, he's close.

279
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,442
- 你现在不能让我退出  - 我知道
- You can't take me off this now.  - I know.

280
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,251
现在不行
Not now.

281
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,250
再过两周
Two weeks.

282
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,610
到那时你还不能置换小托罗 我就撤了你
You don't flip Little Toro by then, I'm pullin' ya out.

283
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,166
谈话结束
We're done.

284
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,004
杰赛普知道我们的事？
Think Jessup knows about us?

285
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,167
什么叫“我们”？ 我们已经不在一起了 记得吗？
What "us"? You don't do "us," remember?

286
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,365
我想起来了
Oh, I remember.

287
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,403
另外 我在约会
Besides, I'm dating.

288
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,441
好吧 好吧 你在约会
Oh, right, right. You're dating...

289
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,843
你的虚拟男友 哈维
Your imaginary boyfriend, Harvey.

290
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,044
他不是我的男友 他的名字也不叫哈维
Uh, he's not my boyfriend, and his name's not Harvey.

291
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,329
我喜欢哈维 这名字听起来很好 哈维
I like Harvey. It has a nice ring to it. Harvey.

292
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,448
你没必要再吃醋了 鲍比
You don't get to be jealous anymore, Bobby.

293
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,726
哈维
Harvey.

294
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,964
是你把我甩了
You pushed me away.

295
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,565
所以你就可以跟哈维在一起了
So you could be with Harvey.

296
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,250
去你的
Fuck you.

297
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,171
小托罗死了
Little Toro's dead.

298
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,044
你跟杰赛普说你就快搞定他了
You told Jessup you were close to flipping him.

299
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,560
没错
I was.

300
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,524
但当我到达农场
But when I got down to the ranch,

301
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,762
帕皮的跟班把他的头装在包里
Papi's boys was throwin' his head around in a bag.

302
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,604
这便是游戏规则
Well, that's game, then.

303
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,681
小托罗已死 杰赛普会撤掉你
With Little Toro off the board, Jessup's pulling you out.

304
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,921
只要你不跟他交代
Not if you don't tell him.

305
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,690
- 我是你的控制者 鲍比  - 没错
- I'm your control, Bobby.  - That's correct.

306
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,761
我必须说给他听
I have to tell him.

307
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,168
所以我需要你
That's why I need you

308
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,683
让我去抢劫特雷司·克鲁塞斯银行
to let me rob Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

309
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,927
你要抢劫银行？
You want to rob a bank?

310
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,281
不 是史迪格想抢银行 他的主意
No, Stig wants to rob the bank. It's his idea.

311
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,726
所以不会有陷阱
So there's no entrapment.

312
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,321
我想要的是…
What I want is access to that money

313
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,448
证明帕皮确实把钱存在保险箱里
that Papi's got in the safe deposit box.

314
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,090
不会有哪个法官会为了保险箱
You know no judge is gonna give you

315
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,730
给你签发搜查令的
a blanket warrant for the boxes.

316
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,764
无需搜查令 即便这是脏钱
We don't need a warrant. Not if the money's evidence in a crime.

317
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,251
我们只是追查它的来龙去脉
We just trace it back to ownership,

318
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,164
我们查到帕皮可能逃税 涉嫌违反反诈骗腐败组织集团犯罪法
we got Papi on tax evasion, possible RICO.

319
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,051
- 是吗？  - 是的
- Yeah?  - Yeah.

320
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,281
那史迪格怎么办？
And what about Stig?

321
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,441
他？
What about him?

322
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,841
他是附属牺牲品
He's a side dish.

323
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,206
你只需在银行外面逮捕他
You bust him in front of the bank,

324
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,965
他就得在监狱里待上20年 而你则获得奖章
he does a smooth 20 years in the penitentiary, you get a medal.

325
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,130
银行事件会让我们抓到帕皮
The bank gets us Papi.

326
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,605
该说的都说了 对吧？
And that's all that matters, right?

327
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,528
无论代价如何 宝贝
It takes whatever it takes, baby.

328
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,802
你真的爱我吗？
Did you ever really love me?

329
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,005
我真的爱你
I really meant to love you.

330
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,320
该死
Shit.

331
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,204
没必要敲门 门总是开着的
You don't have to knock. It's always open.

332
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,482
好 我们去打劫银行吧
Yeah, good. Let's hit the bank.

333
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,681
我们去打劫银行
Let's hit the bank.

334
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,484
- 特雷司·克鲁塞斯银行？  - 没错
- The Tres Cruces?  - That's correct.

335
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,687
该死
Oh, shit.

336
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,650
我还在琢磨怎么离开边境线呢
Here I am still spinnin' about how we got yanked outta line at the border.

337
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,643
那么你加入还是不加入？
So you in or you out?

338
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,929
我加入 好吧 只是…
I'm in, yeah. It's just...

339
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,367
你以前干过吗？
have you ever had anything like that happen to you before?

340
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,046
我是说 他们100%相信我们另有所图
I mean, they were 100% convinced we were holding.

341
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,601
如果帕皮不赖掉那笔可卡因的话 我们会有抓他的证据
And we would've if Papi hadn't welched on that coke.

342
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,928
你话里有话吗？
So you're sayin' that to say what?

343
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,650
我说 你听而已
I'm sayin' it's only 'cause you're hearin' it.

344
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,881
不 你话里有话
No, you sayin' somethin'.

345
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,122
你说的话我都听到了 你必有隐言
And if you sayin' it, I'm hearin' it 'cause you're sayin' it.

346
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,247
说吧 开诚布公
What are you sayin'? Let it be said.

347
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,731
我感觉你在玩我
I think you're fuckin' playin' me.

348
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,847
你喜欢被耍？
Are you wanna be played?

349
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,927
我跟在你屁股后面10个月了
I've been at your hip for 10 months,

350
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,809
上次之后 我认为或许你在耍我
but after this, I think maybe you're playin' me.

351
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,841
- 我吓到你了  - 才没有
- I got you.  - No, you didn't.

352
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,331
我赢了 你的眼角抽动了
Oh, I did. The corner of your eye was twitchin'.

353
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,970
眼角？那不是动
The corner? That wasn't a twitch.

354
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,889
- 是眨眼  - 眨眼是我的招牌动作
- That was a wink.  - That's my move.

355
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,607
帕皮家的小胖子在那儿
Yup, that's Papi's chubby little kid right there.

356
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,890
他妈的真能吃油炸玉米粉饼
Feed that motherfucker quesadillas...

357
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,087
我的天
Oh, my God.

358
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,127
这女人真圆润
She's chubby, too.

359
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,361
前凸后翘啊
In all the right places.

360
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,881
老家伙怎么搞到这货色的？
How does an old, fat, ugly fuck get a girl like that?

361
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,326
有钱嘛
Money.

362
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,521
好了 我们走
All right, here we go.

363
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,043
每两周一次
Same thing every two weeks.

364
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,084
帕皮带着满满一箱子现金穿越边境线
Papi flies over the border with a briefcase full of cash.

365
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,366
和情妇待上一礼拜
He spends a week with the mistress.

366
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,680
雪貂鼻朱里奥开车
Ferret Nose Julio drives it out

367
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,205
把钱存到特雷司·克鲁塞斯银行
to the Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

368
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,362
你觉得他们在银行至少放了三百万
Think they got three million in the bank, huh?

369
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,521
易如反掌
Easy.

370
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,201
来了
Bingo.

371
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,410
钱 钱 钱 钱
Money, money, money, money.

372
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,202
为什么你不去甜甜圈店搞定晚餐呢？
Why don't you hit the diner and check out the doughnuts?

373
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,409
跟你说实话吧 我更喜欢吃碎牛肉
I'm kinda more in a corned beef hash mood, to tell you the truth.

374
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,006
古人云:
You never heard the saying,

375
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,610
永远不要打劫一家
"Never rob a bank across from a diner

376
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,569
正对一家牛皮哄哄的甜甜圈店的银行
that has the best doughnuts in three counties"?

377
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,330
- 狗屁古人  - 古人就这么说的
- That's not a saying.  - Yes, it is.

378
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,767
- 我懂你意思 但那不是古人云  - 你没听过吗？
- I get what you're sayin', but it's not a saying.  - You never heard it?

379
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,887
马上应验给你看
It is a saying. It's a saying now.

380
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,007
你丫的
Okay. Let you tell it.

381
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,481
行动
Make the move.

382
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,489
死缉毒署探员
Bad DEA agent.

383
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,245
- 我坏不坏？ - 你相当的坏
- Am I bad?  - Yes, you are.

384
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,401
我是一个坏女人么
I'm a bad girl?

385
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,726
没错
Yes, you are.

386
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,242
明天3点 史迪格决定抢劫银行
Stig decided to hit the bank tomorrow, 3:00.

387
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,805
史迪格的决定？
Stig decided?

388
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,566
不管有没有我  他都会去
Well, with or without me, he's goin' in.

389
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,449
我还没跟杰赛普说呢
Well, I still haven't talked to Jessup.

390
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,126
史迪格不知道 明天3点他就要进套了
Stig doesn't know that. 3:00 tomorrow he's goin' in.

391
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,567
如果我们想抓帕皮 我就得跟他一起去
If we want Papi, I gotta go in with him.

392
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,482
你都不给我机会 对吗？
You're not even gonna give me a choice, are you?

393
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,089
你没得选 为了保护你
I'm givin' you no other options as a way to protect you.

394
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,208
3点05分当我们出来的时候 让军队候在银行外面
Just have the troops meet me outside the bank, 3:05 when we come out.

395
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,287
3点05分
3:05.

我没有穿海军制服就是为与毒贩打交道
I didn't join the Navy to commit felonies and hang with drug dealers.

428
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,768
点22的枪你打算干嘛？
So, what'd you do with the 22?

429
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,241
用来跟我我表哥换一个咖啡机
Traded to my cousin for an espresso machine.

430
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,647

You're gonna need special beans for that, right?

431
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,686
你可以摸到枪 但我不保证你能不能还扣得到扳机
You can reach for your firearm, but do it real slow.

432
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,171
大楼里还有别的警察吗？
Any other people in the buildin'?

433
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,803
- 怎么回事？ - 银行抢劫
- What the hell is this?  - It's a bank robbery.

434
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,200
只不过是先抢劫警署
Only instead of robbin' the bank

435
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,441
省得你们追我们
and lettin' you chase after us,

436
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,443
我们决定先搞定你们

437
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,561
我们走
Let's go.

It's all right, girls. Just give 'em the drawer cash.

443
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,245
我们说了要抽屉里的现金了吗？
Did we ask for the drawer cash?

444
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,602
快点 快点 快点 坐在这儿 坐下 坐下

What'd you say?

452
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,721
放松
Easy.

453
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,366
你再对我说谎 那他妈就好玩了
You lie to me again, it's gonna be more than a fuckin' problem.

454
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,441

你带着所有人藏在柜台后面

街的对面就是监狱

482
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,800
我们可能是这世界上最幸运的笨蛋了吧？
We couldn't be the luckiest chumps on the face of the earth, could we?

483
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,644
- 你觉得幸运？  - 不觉得
- You feel lucky?  - No, I don't.

484

I mean, this can't be Papi's money.

485
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,331
因为这些钱警察会追我们到天涯海角的
People are gonna chase us off the end of the earth for money like this.

486

I do. I like you more than most.

495
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,529
要不是我拿枪指着你 你才不会那么说
You're not just sayin' it 'cause I got a gun pointed to you?

496
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,204
为什么你不把枪先放下？
Why don't you just put the gun down?

497
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,767
该死

- 该死 老兄 我不得不这么做！ - 不 你不能
- Shit, man, I had to!  - No, you didn't.

It's just a little flesh wound. You'll be all right.

503
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,564
喝点水 然后你就能…
Drink the water, and then you'll be able...

504
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,011

505
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,681
你手里拿着的 是警徽吗？

530
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,121
你们看起来像在等公交车
You fellas look like you're waitin' for a bus.

531
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,085
你早晚要完蛋
You guys let us know when you're done.

532
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,403
我完蛋了 感谢你的仁慈
Oh, I'm done, and thank you for the courtesy.

533
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,561
那家伙是谁？
Who is that guy?

534
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,210
你听说过上帝暗地里留了一手吗？
You heard of the hidden hand of God?

535
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,248
那就是上帝狗娘养的私生子
Well, that's God's son of a bitch.

536
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,561
打电话给DDO 列出知道我们有存款在这里的人名单
Call the DDO and get a list of everyone who knew we had money in this bank.

537
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,923
你们两个戴着墨镜看起来十足蠢蛋
You two realize those sunglasses make you look like assholes.

538
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,211
请问 那个饭店什么时候被烧的？
Excuse me, when'd that diner burn?

539
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,327
昨天
Yesterday.

540
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,731
我想见一下服务生
I want interviews with the wait staff

541
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,040
以及那家所有的顾客
and every customer in the place.

542
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,770
精制油意外燃烧引发的火灾
It was just a grease fire.

543
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,489
我问你的意见了吗 格莫 ？
Did I ask your opinion, Gomer?

544
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,001
古人云
You ever hear the saying,

545
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,809
“永远不要打劫一家
"Never rob a bank across from a diner

546
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,008
正对一家牛皮哄哄的甜甜圈店的银行”？
with the best doughnuts in three counties"?

547
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,127
如果那家店的火灾是偶然的
If that diner fire's a coincidence,

548
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,601
绝对是因为我们查得还不够仔细
it's only 'cause we ain't looking hard enough.

549
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,206
这么多钱真令人印象深刻啊
That is an impressive amount of greenbacks.

550
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,931
一共是4312.5万 长官
43,125,000 of 'em, sir.

551
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,282
再点一遍 把它们收起来 搬到证物间去
Recount it. Pack it up. We'll stow it back in Corpus.

552
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,203
令我惊奇的是 我们原本是最多
It was my impression we were supposed to come out of that bank

553
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,725
带着300万出来的 长官
with 3 million at most, sir.

554
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,167
这是谁的钱？
Whose money was it?

555
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,970
坏人不值得拥有它们
Bad men unworthy of it.

556
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,323
你知道鲍比·比恩斯是缉毒署的吗？
Did you know Bobby Beans was DEA?

557
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,441
不知道
No, I didn't.

558
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,961
无意冒犯 长官 但是你还没有学会控制表情不外露
No offense, sir, but you really need to work on your surprised face.

559
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,570
如果他是缉毒署的 等于他帮我打劫了银行
Well, if he was DEA, he helped you rob a bank.

560
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,800
意思是他也不干净 于此无需仁慈
Which means he's dirty, and for that, I have no mercy.

561
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,568
- 你把他扔到哪了？ - 沙漠里
- Where'd you leave him?  - In the desert.

562
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,768
- 他死了吗？  - 很可能
- Is he dead?  - More than likely.

563
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,970
“很可能”
"More than likely."

564
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,765
你跟我解释一下那什么意思？
You wanna tell me what that means?

565
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,088
计划的重点是设计鲍比·比恩斯
The whole point of you working with Bobby Beans

566
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,446
令其自杀 造成掮客的假象
was to kill him off and create a cut-out

567
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,090
然后犯罪组织就不会追查到我们
so the OP couldn't get traced back to us.

568
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,049
我无懈可击 他们没办法查到
My cover's solid. There's no way it'll trace back.

569
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,646
我无懈可击 他们没办法查到 长官
My cover is solid. There's no way it'll trace back, sir.

570
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,882
你过于高估你的薪水等级了
That's a call made above your pay grade.

571
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,727
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

572
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,244
派两个人把钱送到海军基地
Assign two of the boys to stow the money back at the naval base.

573
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,562
剩下的人跟我一起去检查比恩斯的尸体
The rest'll come with us to check on the body of Mr. Beans.

574
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,364
史迪格 要和我一起吗？
Stigman, wanna come with me?

575
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,809
嘿 老兄
- Hey there, buddy.  - Hey.

576
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,001
你是哈勃？
You habla?

577
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,081
是的 是的
Yeah, yeah.

578
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,531
我是哈勃
I hablo.

579
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,726
好的 那很好
Good, that's good.

580
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,962
别相信他 除非看到证件
Don't trust in him till you see his paper.

581
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,682
如果他有证件 我会看到 你有证件吧？
If he's got papers, I'll see his papers. You got papers, right?

582
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,081
没 没 我没有证件
No. No, I got no papers.

583
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,969
那就成问题了
Well, that's gonna be a problem.

584
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,163
瞧 史利姆杰和我把自己安排到这里
See, Slim Jay and me, we done assigned ourselves

585
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,322
是为了保护这里的边境
protection this here stretch of the border.

586
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,721
官方或者非官方的
Officially unofficially.

587
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,847
我们必须看你的证件
So we really gonna have to see your papers.

588
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,008
确定你不是穆斯林或者别的什么
Make sure you ain't no Muslim or nothin'.

589
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,320
好吧 好 我确实有
Oh, yeah. No, I do have it.

590
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,528
把你的枪给我
And let me have your gun.

591
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,240
把它给我
Give it to me.

592
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,040
谢谢
Gracias.

593
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,647
知道怎么祈祷吗？
You know how to pray?

594
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,571
提莫 现在怎么办 伙计们？
Teemo. How we doin', boys?

595
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,763
有鲍比·比恩斯的任何迹象吗？
Any sign of Bobby Beans?

596
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,929
检查东南方的滩涂
Checked all the washes to the southeast.

597
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,805
没有尸体的痕迹
No sign of a body.

598
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,046
好吧
All right.

599
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,370
好吧 史迪格 你给我们挖了个坑
Well, Stig, you put us in quite a hole.

600
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,171
我不那样看 长官 但是你挂着遮羞布
I don't see it that way, sir, but you're the man with the oak leaves.

601
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,123
我以你为骄傲的理由
All that pride I had in you.

602
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,045
是因为忠诚？
That loyalty?

603
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,521
你刚把它丢弃在风中
You just tossed it to the wind

604
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,726
是的 长官 对不起 长官
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

605
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,121
该死的
God damn it.

606
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,770
他在峡谷！
He's in the wash!

607
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,490
快 快 快！
Go, go, go!

608
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,049
快点 我们把他赶出来！
Come on, let's flush him out!

609
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,644
你要去哪儿 史迪格 ？
Where you going, Stigman?

610
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,725
你跑也没用的
It doesn't matter if you run.

611
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,366
你的制服没了 你行刺宪兵后的六个月里擅离职守
Your jacket's wired, so you're six-months AWOL after stabbing an MP.

612
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,445
即便你跟别人说 他们也会
You talk to anyone, they're just gonna

613
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,090
把你移交给我的
hand you right back over to me.

614
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,207
你没事吧？
You all right?

615
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,643
- 是的  - 那就TMD的起来！
- Yeah.  - Then get your ass up!

616
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,961
扔掉枪
Toss the gun.

617
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,081
操！
Fuck!

Damn it!

621
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,330
天啊！叫我怎么办？
Jesus! What am I supposed to do with this?

622
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,645
啊 老兄 啊！
Aw, man. Aw!

623
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,406
拜托
Come on.

624
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,806
我是兽医 不是外科医生
I'm a vet, not a trauma surgeon.

625
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,441
我可帮不了你 你得走了
I can't help you with this, man. You gotta go.

626
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,601
去哪儿？
Go where?

627
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,569
你该走了 我什么也帮不了
You gotta leave. I can't do anything.

628
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,210
坎尼 你记得几个月前
Kenny, you remember a couple of months ago

629
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,449
你要卖给我500支的克他命(一种麻醉剂)？
you offered to sell me 500 hits of ketamine?

630
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,045
是啊 你说你不感兴趣
Yeah, you said you weren't interested.

631
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,321
没错
Right.

632
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,209
因为我是缉毒署探员
'Cause I'm a DEA agent.

633
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,809
如果你不给我处理伤口
And if you don't fix me up,

634
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,125
我就去缉毒署举证你
I'm gonna go to the D.A.,

635
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,682
我要告诉他们 你在多莉·艾莫丝音乐会外面
I'm gonna tell them that you like cruising Tori Amos concerts,

636
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,804
给那些大学女孩卖K粉
selling Special K to little weepy college girls.

637
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,166
你不可能是警察的
There's no way you're a cop.

638
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,367
- 不可能？ -不
- No?  - No.

639
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,760
- 你确定？ - 我确定
- You sure?  - I'm positive.

640
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,161
你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

641
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,881
在法庭上你有权利请律师
You have the right to have a lawyer present during questioning.

642
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,927
还要继续吗？
Do I need to keep going?

643
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,604
不 我很好 你确是警察
No, I'm good. You're a cop.

644
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,966

- Yeah?  - Yeah.

648
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,325
好吧 再等一下
All right, hold on one second.

649
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,920

Thank you.

651
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,210

- You were late.  - Jesus Christ.

652
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,691
到底发生什么了？
What the hell happened?

653
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,649
- 借过一下  - 借过
- Excuse us.  - Excuse me.

654

我打劫了一家银行 你怎么回事？
I robbed a bank. What happened to you?

655
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,245
3点05的时候我和六个探员在那儿
I was there with six agents at 3:05.

656
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,731

本来你拿出你的徽章

660
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,488
早就可以了结此事
pulled your badge at any time and stopped it.

661
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,284
- 我拿出来了 史迪格开枪打我  - 什么？
- I did. Stig shot me.  - What?

662
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,169
他打中我的肩膀
He shot me in the shoulder.

663
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,481
我们得送你去医院
We gotta take you to the hospital.

664
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,001
打扰你和哈维的约会了？我不想这样
And interrupt your rendezvous with Harvey? I don't think so.

665
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,451
我们要做的是
This is what we need to do,

666
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,921
找到史迪格 找到那些钱
we need to find Stig, we need to find the money.

667
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,761
好吧 听着
All right. Listen.

668
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,366
我上楼找个借口
Let me go upstairs, make my excuses,

669
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,726
然后一起去找史迪格 好吗？
and then we'll find Stig together, okay?

670
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,689
好吧 我们应该这么做
Okay, let's do this. Let's do this.

671
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,490
你先上楼重新检查史迪格的背景资料？
Why don't you recheck Stig's background?

672
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,802
或许我们错过了什么 是吗？
Maybe there was something that we missed. All right?

673
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,482
我去史迪格公寓看有没有其他线索
I'm going to Stig's apartment and see what I can find out.

674
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,682
- 好吗？ - 好
- All right?  - Okay.

675
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,131
代我向哈维问好
Tell Harvey I said hi.

676
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,684
你给谁做过救治了？
Who'd you patch up?

677
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,970
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

678
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,203
我在说什么？
What am I talkin' about?

679
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,162
后院停着一辆沙丘车
Well, there's a dune buggy parked out back

680
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,886
属于一个有枪伤的人抢来的
that was stolen by a man with a bullet hole in him.

681
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,970
在他挨枪子之前
Now, before he had a bullet hole in him,

682
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,046
他烧了一家甜甜圈店 还打劫了一家银行
he burned down a diner and robbed a bank.

683
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,322
我不知道这些事情 所以…
I don't know anything about that, so...

684
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,047
好吧
Okay.

685
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,927
好吗？
Okay?

686
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,081
好得很
Fair enough.

687
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,324
我问你
Say, let me ask you somethin'.

688
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,370
玩过俄式轮盘吗？
You ever play Russian roulette?

689
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,888
当然没有 我想啥呢？
'Course not. What am I thinkin'?

690
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,562
问题是一般人
The thing is, most people,

691
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,362
会把枪指向太阳穴
they put the gun to the temple.

692
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,491
那样太蠢了
And that's, well, that's just stupid.

693
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,366
万一…
What if...

694
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,841
万一子弹在第一发位置呢？
The bullet's in the first chamber?

695
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,282
会直接轰掉脑袋的
You blow a man's head off 'fore he's had a chance

696
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,442
万一他倒是真的有料却不肯告诉你的话
to tell you what you want to know.

697
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,051
不要 不 不 拜托
No. No, no. Come on, man.

698
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,926
真是好运
Case in point.

699
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,966
史迪格！
Stig!

700
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,162
史迪格
Stig.

701
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,846
接电话 鲍比
Pick up, Bobby.

702
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,082
你TMD来这干嘛 鲍比？
What the fuck are you doing here, Bobby?

703
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,690
你在找什么 老兄？
What're you duckin' for, man?

704
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,410
你知道我陷害了你吧？
You know I set you up, right?

705
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,969
他们跟我说了你的一切
They told me all about you.

706
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,528
淘气猫 谁的资料他都有 没亲人
Tough cat. Knows everybody. Doesn't have people.

707
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,605
-那家伙？那家伙是个很好掮客
That guy? Well, shit, that guy's a perfect cut-out.

708
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,922
他吃了一枪 但有谁会在乎呢 对吗？
I mean, he takes a bullet, who's gonna care, right?

709
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,931
接电话
Pick up the phone.

710
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,926
TMD接电话 鲍比
Pick up the damn phone, Bobby.

711
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,160
你有什么要说的？
You got anything to say?

712
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,247
第一个问题
First question,

713
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,766
如果你是缉毒署的 如果你是清白的 为什么独自上阵？
if you're DEA and you're clean, why are you here alone?

714
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,524
你的支援呢 鲍比？
Where's your backup, Bobby?

715
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,205
快点 就是你这种态度
Come on, it's this kind of attitude

716
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,964
让我觉得你不是一个好人
makes me think you're not one of the good guys.

717
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,440
如果我要杀你 在进楼之前
If I wanted you, I could've had you

718
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,682
就能杀你 鲍比
before you walked into that building, Bobby.

719
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,328
那枪不错 史迪格
That's a beautiful rifle, Stig.

720
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,891
是军备用品吧？
Is that Army issue?

721
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,566
你喜欢吗？ 不是军备 是凯马特超市的蓝色特惠货品
You like that? No, it's Kmart. Blue Light Special.

722
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,848
现在回答我的问题 你的支援在哪？
Now answer my question. Where's your backup?

723
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,401
不 不 那是部队装备
No, no, that's a military rifle.

724
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,166
为什么部队的走狗要去打劫银行 史迪格？
What's the military doing robbing banks, Stig?

725
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,802
我们能直话直说吗 鲍比？
Can we just have a straight-up conversation, Bobby?

726
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,484
我分分钟就可以送你去西天
I got you dead to rights.

727
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,406
是吗？ 那么开枪
Yeah? So shoot me.

728
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,006
再打一次
Again.

729
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,921
不敢？
No?

730
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,565
我自己打我自己
I'll shoot myself.

731
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,488
嗯 不错
Huh. Not bad.

732
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,721
我很高兴你印象深刻
I'm glad you're impressed.

733
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,650
你在试我 看会不会先开枪？
Were you testing me to see if I would shoot first?

734
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,165
钱在哪里 史迪格？
Where's the money, Stig?

735
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,045
如果你清白我自然会告诉你 可惜你不是 所以不会告诉你
If I thought you were clean, I might tell you, but I don't, so I can't.

736
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,846
说谎吧你 因为钱不在你那里 钱在哪儿？
You're lying. You don't have it, do you? Where's the money?

737
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,602
- 该死  - 怎么了？
- Oh, shit.  - What?

738
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,410
看来今晚要找我的不止是你
You're not the only one I was expecting.

739
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,845
来了三个淘气包
Three very nasty men just showed up.

740
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,565
如果他们发现你在我的住处 会生气的
If they find you in my place, they will get ugly.

741
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,201
他们是谁？
Who are they?

742
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,566
昨天我说过他们是我的家人
Yesterday I'd have said they were my family.

743
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,005
他们今天就要杀了我
Today they kinda wanna kill me.

744
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,764
- 我了解这种感受  - 你懂个屁
- I understand the feeling.  - You know, fuck you.

745
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,803
你对家人了解多少？你都没有亲人
What do you know about family? You don't even have people.

746
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,046
不 鲍比 那是个坏想法
No, Bobby, that's a stupid idea.

747
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,201
他们已经上楼了
They're already comin' up the stairs.

748
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,600
鲍比！
Bobby!

749
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,050
告诉过你 现在 鲍比
I told you. Now, Bobby,

750
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,202
挂掉免提 打开你的手机
hang up the speaker and answer your cell phone, okay?

751
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,926
如果你想要我帮你脱离…
If you want me to help you out...

752
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,881
呆在阴影里
Just stay in the shadows, okay?

753
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,365
我会指引你出去
I'm gonna guide you out from there.

754
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,086
等着
Wait.

755
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,281
等着
Wait.

756
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,447
他从你后面过去了 你最好闪过门厅
He's comin' up your rear. You better dart across the hall.

757
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,409
藏到卧室里的储物柜后面
Go over to the bedroom and hide behind the lockers.

758
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,647
去
Go.

759
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,205
行了 鲍比 你最好闪过门厅 快
All right, Bobby, you're gonna wanna scoot across the hall. Go.

760
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,327
鲍比 鲍…
Bobby, Bob...

761
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,161
干
Shit.

762
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,325
- 提莫！- 屋顶！
- Teemo!  - Rooftop!

763
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,326
目标移动中！
Target's on the move!

764
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,641
对不起 提莫
Sorry, Teemo.

765
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,129
钱在哪儿？
Where's our money?

766
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,522
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talkin' about.

767
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,330
你以为缉毒署能轻松的进入我们的银行
You think DEA can just waltz into our bank,

768
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,727
偷走我们的钱 我们却毫不在乎吗？
steal our money, and we're not gonna kick?

769
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,887
你的人鲍比偷了我们4300万美元
Your man Bobby Trench stole 43 million of our dollars.

770
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,804
我们想要回来
We'd like it back.

771
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,929
因为那是我们的钱
Because it's our money.

772
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,924
还因为这是明目张胆的不把我放在眼里
Because it's a blatant act of disrespect.

773
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,208
总之这是我们的钱
And because it's our money.

774
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,560
必须是你打来的 鲍比
Please tell me it's you, Bobby.

775
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,723
关于史迪格有什么新消息吗？
Anything new on Stig?

776
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,645
他马上就会查到我已经删除的数据
He's comin' up clean on every database I'm cleared for.

777
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,087
有没有军方关系或者服役记录？
No military connection? No record of service?

778
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,811
多深入一些 我要杰赛普证明我的清白
To go deeper, I'd need to get clearance from Jessup.

779
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,163
好了 试下你在部队里的老熟人
Well, try your old contacts in the military.

780
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,004
我会告诉杰赛普我知道的所有事
I'm gonna tell Jessup everything I know.

781
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,400
等下 你确定吗？
Wait, are you sure?

782
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,086
有人想知道银行里的钱是谁的
Someone has to know whose money was in the bank.

783
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,480
那人是史迪格
Yeah. Stig.

784
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,170
史迪格甚至还不知道我是美国缉毒署的
Stig didn't even know I was DEA.

785
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,766
更何况 还有人也想杀了他
Besides, somebody tried to kill him, too.

786
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,684
鲍比 让我帮你 还需要什么？
Bobby, let me help you. What do you need?

787
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,251
放松点 拜
Take it easy. Bye.

788
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,646
鲍比
Bobby.

789
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,001
该死！
Fuck!

790
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,483
连一个人都打不过 去把门关上
That's how you take down a man. Now shut the door.

791
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,450
安心去吧
Just let it come.

792
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,688
探员罗伯特 林恩 特伦奇
Agent Robert Lynn Trench.

793
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,530
又称鲍比·T或者鲍比·B 同时也是鲍比比恩斯
A.k.a. Bobby T, a.k.a. Bobby B, a.k.a. Bobby Beans.

794
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,290
我们谈谈吧
Let's have a chat.

795
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,005
你偷了4312.5万元
You stole $43.125 million

796
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,321
不属于你的钱
that did not belong to you.

797
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,084
现在 我们坦率一些
Now, man-to-man,

798
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,162
缉毒署里的谁指使你去抢我们银行的？
who at DEA authorized you to rob our bank?

799
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,565
你是银行家吗？
You a banker?

800
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,847
你有玩过俄式轮盘吗？
You ever play Russian roulette?

801
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,880
问题是
Thing is,

802
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,885
大多数人把枪指着太阳穴
most people put the gun to the temple.

803
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,043
这是很愚蠢的
Well, that's just stupid.

804
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,047
不给他一个机会告诉你想知道的所有事
You blow a man's head off 'fore he's had a chance

805
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,327
就打爆他的头
to tell you what you wanna know.

806
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,929
会弄脏你的外套
Mess up your suit, too.

807
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,282
谁告诉你可以拿走我们的钱？
Who told you it was all right to take our money?

808
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,488
“我们的钱 我们的银行”
"Our money. Our bank."

809
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,081
你是谁？
Who are ya?

810
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,568
如果你连我是谁都不知道
If you don't know who I am,

811
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,927
又怎么知道我们有4300万？
how did you know to steal our 43 million?

812
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,844
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

813
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,650
－ 不知道？ - 是的
- You don't?  - No.

814
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,241
好吧…
Well...

815
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,126
钱在哪儿？
Where's the money?

816
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,611
我的乖乖
Oh, boy.

817
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,127
至少不在脚下 我可以向你保证这一点
it ain't down there, I can guarantee you that.

818
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,725
这可是鲍比蛋蛋
A.k.a. Bobby Balls.

819
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,285
剃干净毛的
Clean and shaven.

820
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,010
知道你是什么人吗？
You know what you are?

821
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,326
你
You

822
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,681
是一个黑特工
are a dirty DEA agent.

823
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,811
没错
That's right.

824
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,807
你是一个抢劫银行的黑特工
You're a dirty DEA agent who robbed a bank.

825
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,485
并且杀了你的上司
And shot your boss.

826
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,801
这事情将会在…
You walk into any federal office,

827
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,369
每一间联邦办公室广为人知
and that's the story they're gonna have.

828
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:26,406
除非你把4312.5万还回来
Unless you bring me $43.125 million,

829
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,971
你就可以清白的走人
and you walk away. Clean.

830
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,643
我打动你了吗？
Have I properly incentivized you?

831
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,249
深深地打动了
More than you know.

832
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,202
不想进监狱的话就快点做吧
Unless you wanna rot in jail, you best get after it.

833
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,961
去吧 现在就去
Go on, now. Go on.

834
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,521
好吧
All right.

835
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,809
你觉得他应该有更好的下场？
You're thinkin' he deserved better?

836
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,480
你说对了
You're right.

837
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,531
嘿 鲁迪
Hey, Rudy.

838
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,445
早上好 贾伟
Hola, Javier.

839
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,851
早上好 帕皮
Morning, Papi.

840
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,001
别动
Don't move.

841
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,321
进房子 快点
Go inside, quick.

842
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,401
妈咪！
Mommy!

843
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,001
我们偷了谁的钱？
Whose money did we steal?

844
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,161
你真的想知道？
You really wanna know?

845
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,845
我真的想知道
I really wanna know.

846
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,526
放松 老家伙 进去 进去
Easy, old man, get in there. Get in there.

847
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,601
你要遭报应
Payback's a bitch!

848
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,846
你要遭报应！
Payback's a bitch!

849
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,042
- 哇哦 鲍比  - 放下枪 把钥匙给我
- Whoa, Bobby.  - Drop the gun. Give me the keys.

850
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,565
慢慢地把钥匙给我
Give me the keys. Nice and easy.

851
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,607
我做不到
I can't do that.

852
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,688
- 为什么？  - 我先到场的 我有优先权
- Why not?  - Well, I got him first. I got dibs.

853
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,240
我比你早到44秒 我正在抓帕皮 给我钥匙
I got a .44. I'm taking Papi. Give me the keys.

854
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,641
你想要？ 来拿吧
You want 'em? Come get 'em.

855
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,921
我看到转盘在动
Now, I see the wheels turnin'.

856
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,048
你在想蒙住眼睛 或许用牙齿拿到钥匙
You're thinkin' a little blindfold, maybe use your teeth.

857
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,407
我没这样想 你知道我怎么想的？
That's not what I'm thinkin'. You know what I'm thinkin'?

858
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,123
该死的 老兄 这招怎么样？
Oh, shit, man. How's that?

859
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,884
多此一举
That was uncalled for.

860
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,202
操 我还是喜欢当年的那个小鲍比
Shit. I liked you better when you were "I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

861
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,884
那个鲍比是个好家伙
That Bobby was a good guy.

862
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,962
是的 我喜欢以前那个对着服务生眨眼
Well, I liked you better when you were winkin' at waitresses

863
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,690
并打爆鸡头的你
and shootin' the heads off of chickens.

864
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,603
把钥匙给我 把钥匙给我
Give me the keys. Give me the keys.

865
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,923
- 该死！ - 发生什么了？
Shit!

866
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,082
你看到了吗？没错 给我钥匙
- You saw that move comin'?  - That's correct. Give me the keys.

867
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,765
你真是
Damn, you're good.

868
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,769
现在 我们中的一个要捡起这些钥匙
Now, one of us is gonna have to pick up those keys.

869
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,046
- 猜一下  - 是我会捡起来的 行吧？
- Guess.  - All right. I'll get 'em, all right?

870
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,321
- 捡起来  - 把枪指着其他地方 伙计
- Get 'em, get 'em.  - Put that musket away, man.

871
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,489
- 嘿 停下来！ - 停下来？
- Hey, pull over!  - Pull over?

872
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,369
嘿 帕皮 你喜欢坐我的车吗？
Hey, Papi, you like my drivin'?

873
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,526
糟糕！
Oh, shit!

874
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,887
别这样 鲍比 我不会和你闹一整天的！
Come on, Bobby, I ain't got all damn day!

875
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,526
你想做什么？
What do you wanna do?

876
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,283
好了 没事了 好了 让我走
All right. All right, all right. All right, let me go.

877
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,407
你先放开我
You let me go first.

878
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,527
不 你放开我
No, you let me go.

879
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,291
数到三
On three. On three.

880
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,085
一 二 三
One. Two. Three.

881
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,851
看到了吗？ 现在你让我不能相信你了
See? Now you're making me not be able to trust you.

882
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,524
数到三 我们一起松手
On the count of three, we'll let each other go.

883
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,846
- 好吗？ - 好的 很公平
- All right?  - All right. That's fair.

884
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,126
一 二
One. Two.

885
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,281
三
Three.

886
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,451
我就知道 放开我
I knew it. Let me go.

887
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,682
- 不！ - 我会松手的 我会松手的
- No!  - I'm gonna let you go. I'm gonna let you go.

888
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,046
- 好了  - 一…
- All right.  - One...

889
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,770
好吧 伙计 你必须承认这挺有趣的吧？
Come on, man. You gotta admit, that was kind of fun, no?

890
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,131
你不喜欢？
You didn't like that?

891
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,646
你是谁？
Who are you?

892
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,081
糟糕
Shit.

893
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,169
美国海军情报人员 是吗？
- U.S. Navy Intel.  - Yeah?

894
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,560
或者说曾经是
Or I was.

895
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,001
我的长官因为自己犯错而导致我被取消职位
My commander FUBARed my jacket.

896
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,082
在我刺伤了宪兵后我擅离职守
And now I'm AWOL after stabbing an MP.

897
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,767
你算幸运的 我的罪名是谋杀自己的长官
You're lucky. They got me framed for killing my boss.

898
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,207
你的长官有让你最亲密的四个朋友来杀你吗？
Did your boss order your four closest friends to kill you?

899
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,210
没有 你赢了
No, you got me there.

900
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,210
海军士官迈克尔·史迪格
Petty Officer Michael Stigman.

901
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,530
禁毒官员鲍比·特伦奇 不过我觉得你已经认识我了
DEA Officer Bobby Trench, but I guess you know that already.

902
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,681
幸会
Pleasure.

903
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,127
你对我是歪打正着呢
So, what, you just happened to pick me,

904
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,168
还是受令来陷害我的？
or you got orders to set me up on purpose?

905
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,368
我受令的 但我不知道你是缉毒署的人
I had orders, man. I didn't know you were DEA.

906
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,566
我的人知道 他们有参考消息
My people did. But they're Intel.

907
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,766
他们没什么不知道的
There's not much they don't know.

908
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,001
你的人？
Your people?

909
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,241
现在我得把凌乱的线索拼凑出完整的故事
Now I'm just trying to piece together the truth,

910
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,448
因为我会越级直接去向海军上将汇报
so I can take it over my commander's head to the Admiral.

911
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,648
所以他们想要杀我 并解释我为什么想和帕皮谈话
That's why they wanna kill me and why I wanted to talk to Papi.

912
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,561
明白了
Right.

913
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,326
所以…
Well...

914
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,841
我想我们可以同时跟他对话
I guess we can both talk to him at the same time.

915
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,126
什么 就像搭档一样吗？
What, like we're workin' together?

916
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,565
不 这不意味着我们在合作
No, not like we're working together.

917
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,405
只是表示我们住的比较近而已
- Yeah.  - No, like we're workin' in the same vicinity.

918
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,488
搭档 我们只不过电话区号相同
- Together.  - In the same area code.

919
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,005
搭档 同住一个国家
- Together.  - The same county.

920
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,082
更不要说同住地球村了
And don't get all "We Are The World" on me either.

921
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,931
- 当这件事结束后我还是会射死你  - 但我们是搭档
- When this is over, I'm still gonna shoot you.  - But we're partners.

922
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,604
别这样 伙计 别井水不犯河水的
Come on, man, Ebony and Ivory.

923
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,728
该死 我想他吐了 不是吐了 就是死了
Shit, I think he puked. He's puked or he's dead.

924
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,525
哦 是的 他吐了
Oh, yeah, he puked.

925
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,447
我TMD一定要杀了你们两个
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you both.

926
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,760
这事情有点难度
This might take a while.

927
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,330
我有一整天的时间 伙计
I got all day, partner.

928
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,641
你闻闻看
Hold on.

929
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,563
使劲闻闻看
Let me put that in there with ya. Put that on ya.

930
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,487
搭档 你准备怎么做？
- So...  - Partner, how you wanna do this?

931
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,409
我喜欢你顺其自然的流露
I like that, it's got a nice roll off your tongue there.

932
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,848
我们还没那么亲密 别跟我套近乎 别套近乎
We're not that close. Don't kumbaya with me. Don't kumbaya.

933
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,049
我准备拿上毛巾水桶和冲浪板塞进他的屁股
I'm gonna get my bucket and towel and waterboard his ass.

934
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,691
不 我们要给他一个说话的机会 你有什么想说的吗？
No, we gotta give him a chance to talk. You got anything to say?

935
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,808
我希望你们能喜欢蛋蛋的味道
I hope you guys like the taste of balls,

936
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,282
因为我准备剁下它们再塞进你们的嘴巴里
because I'm gonna chop yours off, stuff 'em in your mouths.

937
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,367
看到吗？
See?

938
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,808
我也可以把你的塞进他嘴巴 把他的塞进你的嘴巴
Or maybe I'll put yours in his and his in yours.

939
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,367
想让我拿桶子来吗？
Want me to get the bucket?

940
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,601
来吧
Kumbaya.

941
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,961
你为什么要把那么多钱放在特雷司·克鲁塞斯？
So why were you puttin' so much money in Tres Cruces?

942
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,885
特雷司·克鲁塞斯银行
It's Tres Cruces.

943
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,891
我们以为你就存放了一点小钱在那儿
We thought you just stashed a little cash there

944
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,850
直到我们抢完银行才发现有4300万美元 为什么？
until we robbed the place, found 40 million. Why is that?

945
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,286
你们抢了特雷司·克鲁塞斯银行？
You robbed Tres Cruces?

946
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,725
没错 为什么？
That's correct. Why is that?

947
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,167
很好笑吗？
That's funny, huh?

948
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,446
你死定了
You're dead.

949
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,483
- 是的 很好笑  - 你们都死定了
- Yeah, that is funny, isn't it?  - You're both dead.

950
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,848
我都不需要亲自动手
And I didn't even have to kill you.

951
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,645
我知道你很厉害 “人尽皆知”的鲍比
I thought you were sharp. "I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

952
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,081
但你…
But you...

953
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,529
刚抢劫了中情局
You just ripped off the CIA.

954
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,811
中情局？
The CIA?

955
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,365
中情局
The CIA.

956
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,807
胡扯 为什么把中情局的钱放在同一家银行？
He's full of crap. Why would he have money in the same bank as the CIA?

957
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,928
你为什么跟中情局在同一家银行里存钱？
Why would you have money in the same bank as the CIA?

958
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,331
那里一毛钱都不属于我
I don't have shit in that bank.

959
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,405
我往特雷司·克鲁塞斯银行存的唯一的钱就是
The only money I deliver to Tres Cruces

960
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,562
给中情局的付款？
- is a payment.  - To the CIA?

961
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,046
中情局拿走我7%的利润
The CIA. They take 7% of my revenue.

962
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,050
作为回报 他们让我用他们的飞机
In return, they let me use their planes

963
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,770
所以我可以带着毒品轻松地飞过边境
so I can get my shit across the border.

964
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,321
我本可以不用花这么多钱 但是根本没得商量
I could do it a lot cheaper, but there was really no negotiations.

965
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,521
你知道…
You know...

966
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,727
他们从每个毒贩手里拿钱
They take it from all the cartels.

967
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,520
放屁
Bullshit.

968
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,921
好吧
Okay.

969
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,051
他们还是会杀了你
They're still gonna kill you.

970
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,486
鲍比？
Bobby?

971
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,004
你说随时都可以收手的
You said stop by anytime.

972
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,091
－ 你绑架了一个毒袅？ - 是的
- You kidnapped a drug kingpin! -That's correct.

973
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:20,004
帕皮·格力高你还把他绑在车库里！
Papi Greco! And you tied him up in my garage!

974
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,964
不好意思 你要…

975
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,440
不介意我吃罐酸奶吧
You mind if I swipe a yogurt?

976
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,008
得了吧 我把这当做家 想吃什么吃什么
Yeah, sure. Please. Help yourself to anything. Take whatever you want.

977
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,206
只是一杯酸奶而已
It's just a yogurt.

978
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,805
但这是她的酸奶 放回去
But it's her yogurt. Just put it back.

979
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,207
麻烦了
Please.

980
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,488
你们两个以前有过一腿？
Are you two like ex-boyfriend and girlfriend?

981
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,040
其实我们从来都没有正式名分
Actually, you know what? We never put a name on it.

982
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,963
那是你伤了他的心还是他伤了你的？
So, what, you broke his heart or he broke yours?

983
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,964
哇 这个人真是口无遮拦
Wow, this guy will really ask anyone anything at anytime.

984
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,809
你不如去看一下帕皮？
Why don't you go and check on Papi, huh?

985
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:49,927
你看上了这家伙的哪一点？
What do you see in this guy?

986
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,484
我可以继续好几小时 但我不认识你
I could go on for hours, but I don't know you,

987
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,005
而且我不认为现在的时机适合…
and I don't think this is the right time

988
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,605
聊天 好吗？
for us to have this conversation, okay?

989
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,449
老爸的教诲？
So daddy issues, huh?

990
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,567
老爸的教诲！
Daddy!

991
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,891
去车库 看帕皮去
Garage. Papi. Go.

992
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,850
- 我知道了  - 走 去车库
- I get it now.  - Go. Go to the garage.

993
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,446
- 我能带上这瓶酸奶吗？ - 可以 带上吧
- Can I have the yogurt?  - You can have the yogurt. Here.

994
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,609
我不喜欢她 伙计我不支持你
- I don't like her, man.  - You don't get a vote.

995
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,841
我会盯着她的
I'm gonna watch her.

996
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,084
鲍比 你在做什么？
Bobby. What are you doing?

997
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,688
你确定你能相信这家伙吗？
Are you 100% sure you can trust this guy?

998
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,162
不 但只有他能帮我
No. But he's all the help I got.

999
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,041
杰赛普死了
Jessup's dead.

1000
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:27,166
我们偷的是中情局的钱 他们是来找钱的
The money we stole was CIA money. They came lookin' for it.

1001
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,644
对不起德比  我不想让你卷进这件事的
I'm sorry, Deb, I didn't mean to get you involved in all this.

1002
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,441
你没事吧？
You okay?

1003
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,130
你傻笑什么呢？
What are you smirking at?

1004
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,249
我绞尽脑汁的想
You know, I've been racking my brain

1005
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,970
想弄清楚你长得像谁
trying to figure out who you look like.

1006
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,690
终于想到了
And it finally dawned on me.

1007
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,440
你是墨西哥版的爱因斯坦
You look like a Mexican Albert Einstein.

1008
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,528
不过明显地 除了他的天才因素
Minus the genius factor, obviously.

1009
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,125
想要一些酸奶吗？
You want some yogurt?

1010
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,246
报应啊报应
Payback's a bitch.

1011
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,206
这一拳为了小托罗
That's for Little Toro.

1012
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,001
史迪格
Stig.

1013
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,087
史迪格！
Stig!

1014
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,607
干掉他！
Pack it up!

1015
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,681
快行动 快行动！
Move it, move it!

1016
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,364
－ 史迪格 - 就一个人
- Stig.  - The one and only.

1017
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,487
那是你的人吗？
That your people?

1018
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,800
你一定要这样说吗？
Do you have to say it like that?

1019
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,485
难道他们不是你的人吗？
Like what? They're your people, right?

1020
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,120
技术上来说是的 但我觉得现在只有你是我的人
Technically, yes, but I thought you were my people now.

1021
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,282
好吧 两枪之后 我们上车 准备好
All right, two taps, we'll hit the garage. On go.

1022
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,089
- 好了 你准备好就出发  - 走！
- Okay. On your go.  - Go!

1023
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,287
该死
Fuck.

1024
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,446
那是怎么一回事？
What was that about?

1025
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,681
一团糟
That was messed up.

1026
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,927
到底怎么了？
What the hell is going on?

1027
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,126
毫无头绪
I don't know.

1028
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,931
我不知道
I don't know.

1029
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,685
把你的手机给我
Give me your phone, now.

1030
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,849
车我也要了 下去 下车！
I'll take the car, too. Get out. Get out!

1031
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:58,967
噢 老天
Oh, my God.

1032
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,922
我在灰色大道
Está en un gray Charger.

1033
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,962
史迪格的人怎么知道你家的？
How did Stig's people know to come to your house?

1034
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,291
不知道 他们一定跟踪你们了
I don't know. They must have followed you.

1035
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,407
不可能
I don't think so.

1036
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,766
我们见过他们
We would have seen 'em.

1037
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:29,841
我们应该见过他们
We should have seen 'em.

1038
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,842
他们怎么知道去你家的？
How'd they know to come to your house?

1039
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,327
啊？
Hmm?

1040
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,484
他们为什么在你家 德比？
Why were they at your house, Debbie?

1041
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,891
你认真的吗？
No. You serious?

1042
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,081
鲍比
Bobby...

1043
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,610
下车
Out of the car, gabacho.

1044
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,841
快
Hurry up.

1045
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,003
你死定了
You fucked up now, I see.

1046
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,726
跪下
On your knees.

1047
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,082
我也会喊人的 鲍比
I know some guys, too, Bobby.

1048
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,682
绑起来 带回去
Bag 'em up. Let's take 'em home.

1049
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,284
- 你想谈一谈吗？ - 不
- Do you wanna talk about it?  - No.

1050
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,850
- 确定？ - 确定
- You sure?  - Yeah, I'm sure.

1051
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,127
告诉过你我不喜欢她 伙计
I told you I didn't like her, man.

1052
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,281
闭嘴
Shut up.

1053
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,761
你干嘛要对我生气？
What are you gettin' mad at me for?

1054
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,080
因为你叽叽歪歪
Because you talk too much.

1055
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,127
我对你做什么了？
What'd I ever do to you?

1056
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,725
除了朝我开枪？
Besides shoot me?

1057
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,045
你知道你是什么吗？ 你是个愤青
You know what you are? You're a misanthorpe.

1058
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,724
是愤青 我是个愤青
It's misanthrope. I'm a misanthrope.

1059
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,962
知道我什么意思吗？
Did you know what I meant to say?

1060
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,530
不知道 你想说什么？
No. What did you mean to say?

1061
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,443
- 你不喜欢人  - 闭嘴
- That you don't like people.  - Shut up.

1062
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,160
轮到我按摩了
Time for my massage.

1063
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,084
我会叫钟点工帮你换床单的
Yeah. I'll have housekeeping clean up your bed.

1064
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,686
该死
Oh, shit.

1065
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:40,683
我爷爷砍了30年的甘蔗 从未起过水泡
My grandfather cut cane for 30 years every day and never got a blister.

1066
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,928
据说闻起来很臭
Says it smells like hell,

1067
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,204
但双手会很强壮
toughens the hands.

1068
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,923
知道我喜欢什么？
You know what I like about this?

1069
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,209
不仅是我现在时间够多
Not only do I get to take my time with you guys,

1070
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,961
更因为我没有后顾之忧了
but this time, I don't have to worry about leaving any marks.

1071
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,964
别用你的手碰我 老家伙
Don't put your hands on me, man.

1072
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,402
操！你刚说什么？
- Shit.  - What did you say?

1073
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,927
别用你沾了尿的手碰我
Just don't put those pissy hands on me, man.

1074
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,600
你无家可归了 鲍比
You ain't got a home, Bobby.

1075
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,361
缉毒署不需要你
DEA doesn't want you around.

1076
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,601
因为你的罪恶
Not with your sins.

1077
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,041
付出报应吧
Payback's a bitch.

1078
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,088
你闻起来真臭
You smell like warm Corona, man.

1079
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:27,520
还记得我得过奖的种牛吗
You remember my prize breeding bull.

1080
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,685
有着跟椰子一样大的蛋蛋
With cojones the size of coconuts.

1081
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,286
想见见它吗？
You wanna see him?

1082
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,010
不用了 在这里就看的很清楚
No, it's okay. We can see good from here.

1083
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,451
永别了 鲍比
Adiós, Bobby.

1084
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,721
不 不
No, no.

1085
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,526
我擦！
Shit!

1086
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,961
四千三百万！
43 million!

1087
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,525
是我们在中情局偷到的所有的钱
It's everything we stole from the CIA.

1088
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,250
你让我们走 我们就会带给你
You let us go, we'll bring it to you.

1089
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,321
钱在我手上
I got the money.

1090
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,010
- 你在说什么？ - 钱在我手上
- What are you talking about?  - I got it.

1091
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,122
- 你没有！ - 我知道我没有 但他不知道
- You don't have it!  - I know I don't have it. He doesn't know that.

1092
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,326
但你手上没那笔钱
But you don't have the money.

1093
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,004
我知道你没有 因为我拿了那些钱
I know you don't have it, 'cause I have it.

1094
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,127
你拿了？钱在哪里？
You have it? Well, where is it?

1095
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,167
奎恩斯长官的保险箱里
Commander Quince's safe.

1096
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,044
天哪 别告诉我 告诉他
- Corpus Christi Naval Air Station.  - Don't tell me. Tell him.

1097
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,486
哦 操！
Oh, shit!

1098
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:13,801
在哪里？
Where is it?

1099
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,527
奎恩斯长官的保险箱里
Commander Quince's safe! Corpus Christi Naval Air Station!

1100
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,280
这家伙在朝我们尿尿 而你还在考虑要不要告诉他
The guy's pissing on us, and you're askin' if we should fuckin' tell him.

1101
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,409
真的吗 还是现在杀了你们更好
If that's the truth, I might as well just kill you now.

1102
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,049
我手下几个人卧底在你这里
I had a run-in with a couple boys out of your organization.

1103
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,521
是谁 厄尔
Hello, Earl.

1104
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:49,844
鲍比·比恩斯先生和迈克尔·史迪格先生
Mr. Bobby Beans and Mr. Michael Stigman.

1105
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,084
他们不是我的手下
Well, they're not from my organization.

1106
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,004
他们都是外人
They're freelancers.

1107
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,886
而鲍比·比恩斯是美国缉毒署的卧底
And Bobby Beans is undercover DEA.

1108
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,961
史迪格是美国海军的离职人员
And Mr. Stigman's AWOL U.S. Navy.

1109
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,686
他们偷了特雷司·克鲁塞斯4312.5万美元
They stole 43.125 million from the Tres Cruces.

1110
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,171
我们想拿回来
We want it back.

1111
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,651
有没有酬金？
Is there a finder's fee?

1112
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,449
酬金就是允许你继续做生意
Fee is we let you continue to do business.

1113
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,205
酬金就是我们不会把我们的提成从7%提升到20%
Fee is we don't raise our cut from 7% to 20.

1114
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:18,604
酬金就是我们不会带着一个中队的阿帕奇A6直升机来这里
The fee is we don't come down here with a squad of Apache A-6 helicopters

1115
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,409
把你从地球上抹去
and wipe you off the face of the earth.

1116
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,043
你希望我的国家变得虚弱和腐败吧？
You like my country weak and corrupt, don't you?

1117
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,366
以便在超市能买到一些便宜货
So you can buy your cheap crap at the mall.

1118
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,929
好吧 厄尔 我可不是好欺负的
Well, Earl, I'm not cheap.

1119
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,048
这有关你的尊严 曼尼？
Is this about pride, Manny?

1120
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,410
男子汉气概？
About machismo?

1121
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,721
证明你是个墨西哥大枭？
Prove you got a big Mexican cock?

1122
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,008
好吧 你是个大人物 非常牛逼
Well, your cock is huge. It's massive.

1123
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,084
而且我非常的敬畏你
And I, I'm in awe of your cock.

1124
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,885
那又怎样？ 你还是个毒贩
So what? You're still a drug dealer.

1125
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:51,204
而我还是美国政府官员
And I'm still the government of the United States.

1126
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,570
市场是自由的 曼尼
It's a free market, Manny.

1127
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,885
但世界并不是自由
Not a free world.

1128
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,087
这事我留意一下
I'll take a look.

1129
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,288
很难看！你会死的很难看的
Hard! You'll look hard.

1130
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,290
翻遍墨西哥的每一块石头
Under every rock in Mexico.

1131
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,969
离开这个鬼地方
Let's get out of this shithole.

1132
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:15,069
把后面那俩家伙洗洗干净

1133
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:20,069
如果那白人真的是美国海军 还有可能拿回4300万

1134
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:24,069
中情局的人怎么办？

1135
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,069
让他去死

1136
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,069
得令 老板

1137
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,169
我决定让你们带给我4300万
I've decided to let you bring me the 43 million.

1138
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,325
卡车会把你们带到边境
The truck'll take you north to the border.

1139
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,370
从那里开始你们要靠双脚
From there, you'll cross on foot with the coyotes.

1140
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,726
我宁愿开车过去
If it's all the same, we'd rather drive.

1141
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,808
所有人都在找你们
With everybody lookin' for you,

1142
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,211
他们马上就会抓住你
they'd pull you out of line in two seconds.

1143
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,611
所以不行 你要走我们的人走的路
No, you go the way you force my people.

1144
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,051
如果我们过不来
If we can't risk crossing,

1145
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,281
怎么把钱给你？
how are we supposed to bring you back the money?

1146
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,601
我会在北部边境24小时等你们
I'll meet you north of the border in 24 hours.

1147
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,642
我相信你们会履行你们的诺言的
Now, I'm trusting you to fulfill your part of the bargain.

1148
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,201
嘿 鲍比
Hey, Bobby.

1149
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,570
你有24小时搞钱
You got 24 hours to bring me the money.

1150
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,523
不然我打爆她的头
Or I'm gonna shoot her right in the head.

1151
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,523
然后找到你
Then I'm gonna find you,

1152
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,762
像杀猪一样把你的肠子挖出来
and I'm gonna gut you like a pig!

1153
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,921
史迪格！
Stig!

1154
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,368
这事完后 我还是会对你开枪
When this is over, I'm still gonna shoot you.

1155
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,244
无所谓的 鲍比
Whatever it takes, Bobby.

1156
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,406
挑一辆 我都可以搞定
Pick one. I can get in anything.

1157
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,811
奥迪怎么样？
So, what about the Audi?

1158
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,724
不 德国车我不干 车锁太复杂 太多警报
No, I don't do German, okay? Locks are tricky, too many alarms.

1159
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,325
好吧 那萨伯曼？
Okay. Suburban?

1160
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,561
那是2010年的款
That one's 2010.

1161
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,881
每两英里就要一加仑的汽油 我才不会为它买单
It's gonna get like two miles a gallon. I ain't payin' for all that gas.

1162
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,764
作为一个偷车贼你太挑剔了
For a car thief, you are mighty particular.

1163
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,121
我可以偷一辆本田
I'll break into the Honda.

1164
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,691
我看上去像是会开本田的人？
I look like I'm gonna ride in that Honda to you?

1165
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,841
是的
You could.

1166
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,490
你可以选一些更经典的车款
And you could pick somethin' with a little more class.

1167
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:31,891
我不想提醒你 但我们准备
I hate to remind you, but we're breakin'

1168
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,166
闯进一个固若金汤的海军基地
onto a high-security Navy base.

1169
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,401
这不是灰姑娘的舞会
We ain't goin' to the hip-hop opera.

1170
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,084
是悲惨世界
It ain't no Les Misérables for you tonight.

1171
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,161
悲惨世界
Les Misérables!

1172
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,327
伙计 不管怎样
Oh, man, whatever the fuck, man.

1173
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,401
别提醒我
Don't remind me.

1174
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:43,087
听着 奎恩斯把钱带回基地不是我的错
Look, it's not my fault Quince took the money back to the base.

1175
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,730
我想你说过是你带着钱回基地的
I thought you said you took the money back to the base.

1176
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,165
不 我没说过
No, I never said that.

1177
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,681
那钱可能在任何地方
So the money could be anywhere.

1178
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,603
可能在开曼群岛 可能在天涯海角…
It could be in East Jabip, the Cayman Islands...

1179
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,091
不 钱就在基地 好吗？
No, the money is on the base, okay?

1180
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,924
我把钱交给了奎恩斯长官
I gave it to Commander Quince at the Camino Real,

1181
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,445
他让人带回基地去了
and he told the guys to take it back to the base.

1182
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,648
自己则正好准备出去杀你
Right before he took you out and tried to kill you.

1183
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,124
那意思他没有说谎
That doesn't mean he's lyin' about the base.

1184
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,283
不是每个人都跟你一样偏执 鲍比
Not everybody's as paranoid as you, Bobby. Jeez.

1185
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,681
普锐斯怎么样？ 你喜欢普锐斯吗？
What about the Prius? You like the Prius?

1186
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,806
卡米诺
Camino Real.

1187
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,160
是个旅馆
Yeah, it's a hotel.

1188
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,406
我在卡米诺遇见德比的
I met Debbie at the Camino Real.

1189
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,481
不是吧
No shit?

1190
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,801
- 真的  - 她在那里干活？
- Yeah.  - What was she doin' there?

1191
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,883
她说在那等她的男朋友 哈维
She said she was there to meet her boyfriend, Harvey.

1192
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,124
等下 你的女朋友有男朋友？
Wait. Your girlfriend has a boyfriend?

1193
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,531
她不是我的女朋友
She's not my girlfriend.

1194
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,601
妈的
Holy shit.

1195
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,566
快选车吧
Yeah, just pick a car.

1196
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,486
就这辆
Right here.

1197
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,281
你选那一辆？
You picked that one?

1198
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,401
是的
Yeah.

1199
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,804
你竟然要一辆宾利？
Fuck you want, a fuckin' Bentley?

1200
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,406
我来吧
I got it.

1201
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,931
恕我无知
Crazy question,

1202
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,851
你该不会碰巧认识修雪地摩托的人吧？
you wouldn't have anybody knows how to fix a snowmobile?

1203
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,001
未必哦
I don't think so.

1204
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,083
你能帮我找下吗？我今晚要用
Would you check for me? I really need it fixed by tonight.

1205
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,931
暴风雪要来了？
Why, a big storm coming?

1206
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,969
有备无患嘛
You never can be too sure.

1207
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,241
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

1208
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,525
- 你搞什么动作？  - 什么？
- Up with that?  - What?

1209
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,648
她对你笑了 你都没有眨眼？
She smiled at you, you didn't wink at her?

1210
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,723
我不会对看见的每个女人眨眼
I don't wink at every woman I see.

1211
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,487
德州的雪地摩托是吗？ 你一定遇到大问题了 水手
Snowmobile in Texas, huh? You must be in some serious shit, sailor.

1212
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,846
你搞了一个新爪子了 哈？
You got yourself a new claw, huh?

1213
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,242
- 给我一爪 来碰碰  - 很漂亮
- Gimme claw. Give it a pound.  - It's a beaut.

1214
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,164
你还留着我的雨天备用物吗？
You still got my rainy-day stash?

1215
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,446
当然啦
Yeah.

1216
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,771
稍后再见 史迪格
See ya later, Stig.

1217
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,041
没问题
All right.

1218
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,368
据说轻声软语的人反而爱使M4步枪 带榴弹炮
You know what they say, talk softly and carry an M-4 with a grenade launcher.

1219
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,451
你想要哪把？
Which one you want?

1220
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,880
这一把
This one.

1221
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,724
你进入基地的计划是什么？
What's your plan for gettin' on the base?

1222
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,087
正在想
I'm workin' on it.

1223
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,529
记住 一旦我们进入指挥总部
Remember, once we get to the command building,

1224
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,204
奎恩斯的办公室在底楼大厅的最后一间
Quince's office is first floor, end of the hall.

1225
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,362
如果他不在训练场的话 他每天在那住18小时
If he's not in the field, that's where he lives 18 hours a day.

1226
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,885
好的 但你还是没告诉我
Right, right. But you still haven't told me

1227
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,570
穿过那扇门的计划是什么
what the plan is to get through the gate.

1228
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,166
我有计划 我的意思是 我能想出一个计划
I got a plan. I mean, I'm capable of comin' up with a plan.

1229
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,281
我不管你有没有能力
I'm not sayin' you're not capable,

1230
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,771
告诉我计划是什么就好
I'm just sayin' you haven't told me. What is it?

1231
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,370
还在想
I'm workin' on it.

1232
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,846
最好快一些
Better work faster.

1233
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,081
再快一些
Much faster.

1234
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,249
过来 快点
Move it up. Quickly.

1235
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,321
操！
Fuck it.

1236
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:32,927
停下来！
Halt!

1237
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,491
他要闯进来！
He's going through!

1238
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,845
够快了吗？
That fast enough for ya?

1239
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,081
操！
Shit!

1240
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,248
上车 快点 无线电联络！
Let's go! Let's go! On the radio now!

1241
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,486
返回岗位！
Return to post!

1242
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,047
这就是你的计划？
That was your plan?

1243
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,246
我们进入海军基地了吧？
Well, we're on the base, aren't we?

1244
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,210
这不是一个计划 没有一个正常人会闯入海军基地
That's not a plan. Nobody in their right mind breaks into a naval base.

1245
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,964
所以这才是一个聪明绝顶的计划 没人想得到
That's why it's a brilliant plan. No one expected it.

1246
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,010
你应该照照镜子 他们被我吓呆了
You shoulda seen your face. Damn, they were surprised.

1247
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,650
你别跟着 我来做诱饵
Your stop comin' up. I'll play decoy,

1248
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,245
带他们走远一点 试着找到将军 好吗？
lead 'em away, try to get to the Admiral, okay?

1249
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,926
好的 出差错的话 我会在船坞等你
All right. Things go wrong, I'll see you back at the boat yard.

1250
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,201
不能有差错
Things ain't goin' wrong.

1251
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,523
我会得奖章的 我会找到海军上将的 我会得奖章的 看着吧
I'm gettin' a medal. I get to the Admiral, I'm gettin' a medal. Watch.

1252
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,045
你会祝我好运吧？
You're gonna wish me luck, aren't ya?

1253
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,366
- 说吧伙计 让我听到！ - 祝你好运
- Come on, man, let's hear it!  - Good luck.

1254
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,325
奎恩斯的办公室在大厅的尽头
Quince's office at the end of the hall.

1255
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,721
记住第一层大厅的尽头！
Remember, first floor, end of the hall!

1256
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,323
停下！ 别动！
Halt! Stop where you are!

1257
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,004
有人闯入了办公大厅
We have a breach at Status Hall!

1258
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,081
上！
Go, go, go, go!

1259
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,885
上楼！
Up the stairs!

1260
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:48,044
长官 士官迈克尔·史迪格 编号54033
Sir, Petty Officer Michael Stigman, ID number 540333.

1261
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,440
等一下 怎么了？
Wait a minute, what's the problem?

1262
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,962
不好意思了 伙计 我也不想这么做的
Shit, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that to you, man.

1263
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:54,807
长官
Sir.

1264
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,327
我已服役12年
I've been in service 12 years.

1265
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,568
我从没有想过踏入军官食堂 更不要说闯进来了
I've never stepped foot in an officers' mess, much less crashed it.

1266
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,130
拜托了 长官 是紧急事件
Please, sir, it's an emergency.

1267
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,325
请出去吧
Stand outside, please.

1268
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,368
- 让我们谈谈  - 谢谢长官
- Leave us alone.  - Thank you, sir.

1269
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,851
我不想那样打你 我道歉
Hey, I'm really sorry about that, man.

1270
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,161
我不是有意要打你 我道歉
I didn't mean to hit you like that. I apologize.

1271
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,527
我听着呢 水手 坐下吧
I'm listening, sailor. Sit.

1272
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,806
谢谢长官
Thank you, sir.

1273
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,608
- 再帮我接一次海军上将  - 是 长官
- Try the Admiral again for me.  - Yes, sir.

1274
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,851
你相信这些被偷的钱会
And you believed this stolen money

1275
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:41,844
被用来打击贩毒联盟？
would all be used to fight drug cartels?

1276
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,731
是 长官 我认为命令是来自上级的有效命令
Yes, sir. I thought the orders came down the valid chain of command.

1277
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,763
盲目地忠诚不是忠诚
Blind loyalty is not loyalty.

1278
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,450
我知道 长官 所以我在这里
I know that, sir, and that's why I'm here.

1279
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,723
好吧 你已经展现出来你有多顽强
Well, you've shown a lot of tenacity

1280
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,450
和来这里见我的勇气
and a lot of guts bringing this to me.

1281
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,802
谢谢长官 有你这句话就好了
Thank you, sir. That means the world comin' from you.

1282
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:59,530
不幸的是 我什么都帮不了你
Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do for you.

1283
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,887
是 长官 我的意思是你只要把基地关闭
Of course, sir. I mean, you can just lock down the base.

1284
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,121
你可以逮捕奎恩斯长官
You can arrest Commander Quince.

1285
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,204
美国海军不会抢劫银行
The United States Navy does not rob banks.

1286
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,362
海军个人也不会抢劫银行
Its personnel did not rob a bank.

1287
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:12,167
我不会让一个犯错的海军人员砧污整个海军正直的形象
I'm not gonna tarnish the integrity of the Navy over one crooked sailor.

1288
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,925
如果有从银行里拿来的钱
If there was money taken from the bank

1289
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,970
那就是中情局的肮脏基金
that was part of an illegal CIA slush fund,

1290
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,600
海军不承认这笔钱的存在
the Navy had no knowledge the fund existed.

1291
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,962
六个月的擅离职守？
Your jacket has you six months AWOL?

1292
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,041
是 长官
Yes, sir.

1293
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,129
会保持原样
It's gonna stay that way.

1294
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,410
奎恩斯长官跟你一样 所以他也是擅离职守
Commander Quince's jacket will likewise be amended so he's also AWOL,

1295
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,847
这都不是海军的问题
making none of this the Navy's problem.

1296
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,208
长官 这样做不对
Sir, this isn't right.

1297
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,044
我还有更多办法
Well, I'd offer more,

1298
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,605
当手得了坏疽时
but when the hand has gangrene,

1299
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,682
你得截肢来保住性命
you chop it off to save the body.

1300
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:48,331
小拇指固然需要 但并非必要
You don't keep the pinkie around just because it meant well.

1301
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:00,720
把史迪格士官扔在大门外
Have Petty Officer Stigman dropped outside the main gate.

1302
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,811
他再走近任何一个军事基地
He sets foot on a military base anywhere in the world,

1303
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,530
就对他开枪
I want him shot.

1304
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,806
扯淡
This is bullshit.

1305
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,201
很多像我一样的人为执行命令出生入死
You know, men like me fight and die on the orders of men like you!

1306
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,204
没有我们 你肩章的星星不过是该死的装饰品！
Without us, those stars on your shoulder are a fucking costume!

1307
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:33,921
打开保险箱
Open the safe.

1308
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,007
你上司知道你在干什么吗？
Does your boss know you're doin' this?

1309
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,127
打开
Open it.

1310
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,521
也许中情局像已经杀了她 好比杰赛普
Or did the CIA kill her like they did Jessup?

1311
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,721
和你有什么关系
What's it to you?

1312
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,881
我不喜欢烂摊子
I don't like loose ends.

1313
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,047
我也不喜欢
Neither do I...

1314
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,407
哈维
Harvey.

1315
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,003
我妈叫我哈罗德
Well, my mother named me Harold.

1316
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,601
我喜欢哈维这名字 哈维很好听
I like Harvey. Harvey has a nice ring to it.

1317
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,530
你不喜欢哈维？
Don't you like Harvey?

1318
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,089
- 不知道你说什么  - 不 你知道
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.  - Yes, you do.

1319
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,642
最近去过卡米诺皇家酒店？
Been to the Camino Real Hotel lately?

1320
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,926
打开保险箱
Open the safe.

1321
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,881
清空区域！
Staging area cleared up!

1322
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,041
放过来！
Bring it through!

1323
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,201
钱在哪儿？
Where's the money?

1324
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,730
告诉我德比在哪儿
You tell me where Deb is.

1325
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,526
她于此事有染 钱在哪儿？
She's gettin' her nails done. Where is the money?

1326
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,006
不知道
I don't know.

1327
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,883
把你知道的告诉我
All right, tell me what you do know.

1328
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,524
你女朋友找到了中情局在哪儿藏钱
Well, your girl found out where the CIA

1329
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,841
就像我做的那样
was stashing the money right about when I did.

1330
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,251
我献上一计
And when I told her

1331
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:46,529
建议她和我带着钱跑路 把烂污拆到你和史迪格头上
that she and I could get away with the money by setting you and Stigman up,

1332
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,726
她甚至不眨眼就同意了
she didn't even blink.

1333
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,444
别对我说谎
Don't lie to me.

1334
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,682
鲍比 她不开心吗？
Was she that unhappy, Bobby?

1335
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,725
钱在哪儿？ 不要说谎
Where is the money? Don't lie to me.

1336
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,651
你和史迪格还活着 你觉得我会傻到把钱在放这吗？
You think I'd keep it here with you and Stigman still alive?

1337
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,285
得了 鲍比
Come on, Bobby.

1338
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,843
你把钱给她了 是吗？
You gave it to her, didn't you?

1339
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,840
是不？
Didn't you?

1340
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,442
指挥官 往后退
Commander. Back up.

1341
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,970
- 快！ - 六点方向
- Go, go, go, go!  - On your six!

1342
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,571
麻利点！
Move, move, move!

1343
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,886
全体人员 撤离建筑物
All personnel evacuate the building.

1344
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,243
全体人员 撤离建筑物
All personnel evacuate the building.

1345
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,006
撤回来 在巷子里！
Take the back, in that alley!

1346
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,366
到前面去！ 行动！
Go to the front! Let's go!

1347
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,770
这边！ 快！
This way! Move!

1348
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,884
快点！ 找到他！
Come on, come on! Find him!

1349
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:30,927
安全！
Clear!

1350
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,641
安全！
Clear!

1351
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:03,721
你没事吧？
You Okay?

1352
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,370
快 我们走
Come on, let's go.

1353
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,368
- 还好吗 长官  - 我挺好
You okay, sir? Yeah, I'm fine.

1354
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,083
抬水管
Work off the standpipe!

1355
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,080
很不错的烤肉
This is really good barbecue.

1356
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,326
不尝会后悔的
You don't want to regret not tryin' it.

1357
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,044
别浪费时间 直接杀了我吧
Why don't you stop wasting my time and just kill me?

1358
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,881
即便鲍比带着钱来
Even if Bobby was coming with the money,

1359
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,968
你都会杀我俩的
you'd still kill us both.

1360
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,686
但他没来
But he's not coming.

1361
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,168
- 他会来  - 不会
- He'll be here.  - No.

1362
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,281
他不会的
He won't.

1363
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,327
你认为他会让你送死？
You think he's just gonna let you die?

1364
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:20,208
你觉得海军直接到我家找鲍比是巧合吗？
You think it was a coincidence the Navy came looking for Bobby at my house?

1365
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,126
如果没有鲍比 我起码能分一半的钱
If I couldn't have Bobby, at least I'd have half of 43 million.

1366
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,607
你设计了鲍比·比恩斯
You set up Bobby Beans.

1367
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,088
换我也不会为你来送死
I wouldn't be coming for you either.

1368
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:34,720
钱在哪儿？
Where's the money?

1369
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,008
拜托 我不知道
Come on. I don't know.

1370
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,730
不在这个国家了
Gone, outta the country.

1371
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,360
显然也没在海军基地 帕皮
It's certainly not on a Navy base, Papi.

1372
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,409
那笔钱在哪里离开你的？
Where does that leave you?

1373
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,367
应该说那笔钱会在哪里等我去享受
Exactly where I deserve to be.

1374
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,205
- 是我  - 鲍比
- Yeah.  - Bobby.

1375
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,571
你迟到了
You're late.

1376
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,166
我拿到钱了
I got the money.

1377
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,049
我不信
I don't believe you.

1378
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,247
我拿到了
No, I got it.

1379
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,403
相信我 我会带来给你的
Believe me, I got it. I'll bring it to you.

1380
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,970
你在哪儿？
Where are you?

1381
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:10,891
嗨 鲍比
Hi, Bobby.

1382
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,326
德比？
Debbie?

1383
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,201
他听得到我们吗？
Can he hear us?

1384
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,529
挂电话就跑吧
Just hang up the phone and run.

1385
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:20,045
好吧 听我说
Okay, listen to me.

1386
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:23,044
告诉他我拿到钱了
Tell him I got the money.

1387
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,571
挂电话
Hang up the phone.

1388
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,528
不是你的错 只是…
It's not your fault. Just...

1389
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,601
德比
Debbie.

1390
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,724
告诉他我拿到钱 好吗？
Tell him I have the money. Okay?

1391
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,764
我知道你清楚钱的下落
And I know you know where the money is.

1392
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,361
只管告诉他我拿到钱了
Just tell him I have it.

1393
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,485
德比 听我说
Debbie, listen to me.

1394
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,131
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1395
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,009
我真的爱你
I really meant to love you.

1396
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,446
德比
Debbie.

1397
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:56,610
你在哪儿？ 德比 你在哪？
Where are you? Debbie, where are you?

1398
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,402
你在哪儿？ 德比？
Where are you? Debbie?

1399
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:02,926
喂
Hello?

1400
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,407
喂
Hello?

1401
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:12,841
喂
Hello?

1402
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:17,805
喂 德比 嗯…
Hello? Debbie? Uh...

1403
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:24,481
等等 我拿到钱了
Wait a minute, I got the money.

1404
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,130
他们说什么？ 上将说了什么？
What'd they say? What'd the Admiral say?

1405
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:45,044
上将说了什么？上将说他知道整个事情的经过
What'd the Admiral say? Admiral washed his hands of the whole thing.

1406
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,360
海军打发他们上路了
Navy turned their back.

1407
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:47,680
钱在哪儿？
Where's the money?

1408
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,601
史迪格 没有钱
There was no money, Stig.

1409
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,409
什么？钱不在
What? There was no money.

1410
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:54,766
肯定有钱 我把钱给了奎恩斯
'Course there is. I gave Quince the money.

1411
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:57,525
对 奎恩斯把给了德比 但德比死了
Right, and Quince gave it to Deb, and Deb is dead.

1412
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,206
帕皮杀了她
Papi killed her.

1413
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,765
操
Fuck him.

1414
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,410
我们去墨西哥
Let's go down to Mexico.

1415
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,926
把他们打倒 杀光
We'll lure 'em all down, then take every one of 'em out. Kill 'em all.

1416
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,801
然后怎样？
And then what?

1417
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,285
至少奎恩斯和帕皮会死
Well, at least Quince and Papi'd be dead.

1418
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,600
然后又怎样？
And then what?

1419
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:17,920
哦 你让他们逍遥法外吗？
Oh, you just wanna let 'em skate?

1420
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:18,967
史迪格 你没有得到钱吧？
You don't get it, do ya, Stig?

1421
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,520
上帝保佑 你还认同规矩吗
I mean, God bless you, you still think there's some kinda code.

1422
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,125
没有规矩
There is no code.

1423
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:26,170
你誓死效忠海军 他们当你是炮灰
You followed every order the Navy gave you, they kicked you in the teeth.

1424
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,480
没有规矩 史迪格
There is no code, Stig.

1425
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:30,325
没人为了海军拼命 懂吗? 此事与海军无关
No one fights for the Navy, okay? It's not about the Navy.

1426
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,448
你是在为你身边的人而战斗
You fight for the guy that's fighting next to you.

1427
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,491
这对你没有任何意义吗？
That doesn't mean anything to you?

1428
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,324
我要去墨西哥
I'm goin' to Mexico.

1429
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:41,929
你很清楚 我的规矩救了你的命
And just so you know, my code saved your life.

1430
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,650
心脏和肩膀之间有三英寸
There's three inches between your heart and your shoulder.

1431
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,722
若子弹往左边移三英寸 你就死了
My bullet goes three inches left, you'd be dead.

1432
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:46,841
而我也就不会在这里了
And I wouldn't be here.

1433
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,400
奎恩斯杀我是因为我让你活着
'Cause Quince only decided to kill me because I let you live.

1434
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:52,211
你觉得是我失手了？
What, you think I missed, huh?

1435
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,487
你觉得是我失手？
Is that what you think? You think I missed?

1436
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,009
你几时看我失手过？
When have you ever seen me miss?

1437
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,841
你呆着吧 我要去墨西哥
You stay here. I'm goin' to Mexico.

1438
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,164
交易还成立吗？
Our deal still stand?

1439
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,121
把钱给你 我就可以洗白正身吗？
I give you the money, I walk away clean?

1440
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:26,010
哇 早起的鸟儿有肉吃
Hola. Looks like you had a banner morning.

1441
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,684
你最好带了钱来
You better have my money.

1442
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,365
都在这里了 一分不少
Right here. Every penny.

1443
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,161
鲍比在哪儿？
Where's Bobby?

1444
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,322
我们的哲学观有分歧
We had a philosophical fallin' out.

1445
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:34,970
打开你的车子
Open your trunk.

1446
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:37,970
你只需承诺你和朱里奥及所有手下
I just want your word that you and your boys, Ferret Nose Julio, all of 'em,

1447
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,451
帮我杀掉奎恩斯
you'll help me kill Commander Quince.

1448
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,165
谁是奎恩斯？
Who's Commander Quince?

1449
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,161
就是他
That's him.

1450
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,366
史迪格先生 你承诺杀掉农场所有人
Mr. Stigman, you promised me $43 million

1451
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:56,044
就给我4300万美元
for killin' everyone on this ranch.

1452
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,121
钱都在这儿
Got the money right here, sir.

1453
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,242
问题是我也承诺给帕皮同样多的钱
Thing is, I promised Papi the $43 million, too,

1454
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,004
恐怕你们要一决高下
so I'm afraid you two are gonna have to duke it out.

1455
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,606
或许他和我先杀你 再分钱
Maybe he and I'll just kill you instead and split the money.

1456
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:04,727
帕皮你意下如何？
What do you say, Papi?

1457
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,647
4300万美元的一半？
50% of 40 million?

1458
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,484
好过百分百死掉吧 对吧？
Better than 100% dead, right?

1459
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,410
他会出卖你的 一转身子弹就打穿你的头
He'll double-cross you. Minute your back is turned, bullet in the head.

1460
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,011
5 5分成
50-50.

1461
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,162
屋顶上的家伙说6 4分成
The guy up on the roof says 60-40.

1462
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:20,242
他浑身上下没有一个地方值得信赖
He ain't got a trustworthy bone in his body.

1463
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:21,964
我回来了　不是吗？
I came back, didn't I?

1464
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,364
操蛋的中情局
Fuckin' CIA.

1465
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:57,883
红毛狗 红毛狗(儿歌)
Red rover, red rover.

1466
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:02,922
无论谁拿了我的4300万美元 最好给我出来
Whoever's got my 43.125 million better come the fuck on out.

1467
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,570
你也承诺给他钱了？
You offer him the money, too?

1468
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:05,767
我没喊过他
I didn't call him.

1469
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,251
在车尾箱里
It's in the trunk!

1470
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:08,885
你为什么告诉他？
Why the fuck did you tell him that?

1471
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,640
谢了 指挥官
Thank you, Commander.

1472
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,809
史迪格先生 打开车尾箱
Mr. Stigman, come on out and open the trunk.

1473
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,450
轻缓优雅点
Nice and slow, now.

1474
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,881
看又谁来了？
Well, what do we got here?

1475
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,729
听起来像墨西哥婚礼
Sounds like a Mexican wedding.

1476
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,922
那是我的1964年雪佛兰吗？
Is that my '64 Impala?

1477
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,846
没错
That's correct.

1478
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,126
我告诉过你
I told you.

1479
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,649
我有熟人
I know a guy.

1480
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:03,767
现在
Now,

1481
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:06,287
谁想见4300万？
who wants to see $43 million?

1482
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,286
一瞬间的感觉 你始终让我在追赶自己的尾巴
For a minute there, I thought you had me chasing my tail.

1483
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,521
想数数吗？
You want to count it?

1484
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:18,042
如果你骗我 我知道在哪儿能找到你
If you're shortin' me, I know where to find you.

1485
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:19,326
成交吗？
So we're good?

1486
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,561
我不是已经给你承诺了嘛
Did I not give you my word?

1487
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:21,641
很好
That's right.

1488
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,649
那就不要耍我
Then don't treat me like an asshole.

1489
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,006
尽力吧
I'll try my best.

1490
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:31,210
你和史迪格自由了
You and Mr. Stigman are free to go.

1491
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,327
是 长官
Yes, sir.

1492
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,004
我相信你能找到回家的路
I trust you can find your own way home?

1493
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,047
没错
That's right.

1494
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,451
－ 鲍比 你在做什么？  - 走吧
- What're you doing, Bobby?  - Let's go.

1495
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,130
我不会让他带着钱走的
I'm not gonna let him get away with the money.

1496
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,531
走吧 我讨厌这些可恶的家伙
Let's go. I hate these daggone teeth.

1497
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,681
他们不会让我们走
They're not just gonna let us go.

1498
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:42,489
- 我有一个B计划  - 嘿 我带着M-16
- I got a plan.  - Hey, I got my M-16.

1499
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,927
我带了枪榴弹发射器 还有M-4 我们干一票
I got my grenade launcher, I got my M-4. Let's do this shit.

1500
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,241
我有计划 我有能力拿出计划
I got a plan. I'm capable of coming up with a plan.

1501
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:48,526
最好是一个该死的好计划
Well, it better be a goddamn good one.

1502
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:49,681
绝对好计划
It's a good plan.

1503
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:50,966
让暴风雨来得更猛烈些吧
Make it rain.

1504
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,288
你的计划就是炸掉4300万吗？
That was your plan? To blow up $43 million?

1505
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,761
对 这是个聪明的计划 没人料到
Yeah, that's why it's a brilliant plan. Nobody expected it.

1506
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,401
走
Go.

1507
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,365
快点搬开
Come on, move it!

1508
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,166
该死 搬开
Dumb assholes! Move it!

1509
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:22,921
你来不来？
You comin'?

1510
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,245
走 我罩你
Go ahead, I'll be right behind you.

1511
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:33,327
不要失手
Don't miss.

1512
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,731
我从不失手
I never miss!

1513
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,407
就是说嘛
Told ya.

1514
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,241
史迪格！ 史迪格！
Stig! Stig!

1515
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:21,850
不要 不要
Don't do it. Don't do it.

1516
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,921
游戏结束
Playtime's over.

1517
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,244
别开玩笑
No more fucking around.

1518
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:27,486
现在
Now,

1519
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,329
放下武器
drop your weapon.

1520
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,729
告诉史迪格先生也放下
Tell Mr. Stigman to do the same.

1521
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:32,961
你自己告诉他
You tell him.

1522
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,243
很简单
It's real simple.

1523
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,846
要么交易成功 要么死
We can all make a deal or we can all die.

1524
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,450
我不做任何交易
I'm not making any deals.

1525
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,249
鲍比 告诉你的人
Talk to your man, Bobby.

1526
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,685
聪明点
Be the smart one.

1527
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:46,570
你觉得我们只用特雷司·克鲁塞斯银行放钱吗？
You think Tres Cruces is the only stash we got?

1528
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:50,167
我们有20家 到处都有我们的钱
We got 20 more. We got money everywhere.

1529
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,844
你改变不了任何现状
You're not gonna change a damn thing.

1530
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:52,921
史迪格？
Stig?

1531
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:54,401
干嘛？
Yeah?

1532
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,161
你是我的人 对吗？
You're my people, right?

1533
01:37:58,960 --> 01:37:59,961
是的
That's correct.

1534
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:14,881
还好吗？
You good?

1535
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,131
从没有这么好过
Never better.

1536
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:19,289
我们不是一种人
We're not people, though.

1537
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,646
但却是一家人
This makes us family.

1538
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,851
好的 兄弟
All right, brother.

1539
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:24,726
嘿 大兄弟
Hey, se?or Einstein,

1540
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,167
你坐在那里的样子看起来逊毙了
you're looking kind of fucked up sittin' there, man.

1541
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:28,241
你还好吗？
You all right?

1542
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:34,282
修剪我的草坪
Mow my lawn.

1543
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:47,881
好吧 你知道什么才酷吗？
Well, you know what was so cool?

1544
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:49,849
坐在1964年产的雪佛兰里
You rolling in on that '64 Impala.

1545
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,445
意思是 你看起来很坏
I mean, you looked badass, man.

1546
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,681
没错
Yeah, that's right.

1547
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:54,922
听着 还有件事
Listen, one more thing, one more thing.

1548
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,081
什么？
What?

1549
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,440
把枪给我
Give me your gun.

1550
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,411
把枪给我
Give me your gun.

1551
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:00,481
你在开玩笑吗
You're not serious.

1552
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:01,561
我在开玩笑
Yes, I am.

1553
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:02,921
谢了
Thank you.

1554
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,042
经历了这么多你不会要这样做吧？
You're really gonna do this after everything we've been through?

1555
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,009
胳膊或腿？
Arm or leg?

1556
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,605
这不会让你感觉好点的
This is not gonna make you feel better.

1557
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:11,650
腿吧 因为腿部肌肉多 不会伤到骨头
I'm thinking leg. Because leg, there's more flesh, there's not as much bone.

1558
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:12,926
胳膊就…
The arm will...

1559
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,490
你知道你是什么吗？ 你是个十足的…
You know what you are? You are a petty...

1560
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,086
贱种
Fucking son of a bitch!

1561
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,043
痛吧？ 你真的会杀了我的
Hurts, doesn't it? You know you coulda killed me?

1562
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:21,043
真的吗？ 左边三英寸
Is that right? Three more inches to the left.

1563
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,121
不许提
Don't even say it, man.

1564
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:23,611
如此你就不会再和女招待眨眼了
You wouldn't be winking at waitresses anymore.

1565
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:25,648
我不眨眼了 这笔恩怨一笔勾销
I'd still wink, I just wouldn't be able to do anything about it.

1566
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:26,846
你知道我的 我从不失手
You know me, I don't miss.

1567
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:29,526
从不失手 你什么时候看我失手过？
- I never miss.  - When's the last time you saw me miss?

1568
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:32,251
你要把我抬回家
You gonna carry my ass all the way the fuck home.

1569
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,283
痛死啦
Oh, shit, man. This burns.

1570
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:35,771
没错
That's correct.

1571
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,765
开枪打你的时候我不知道你是谁
You know, I shot you when I didn't know who you were.

1572
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,251
之前我们还亲如一家
Before we were family.

1573
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:42,321
没关系
There's a difference.

1574
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:44,767
但现在我们是一家人 我打你是因为我知道你是谁
But we're family now. I shot you because I know who you are.

1575
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,086
没道理啊
That ain't right.

1576
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,804
他们看起来都一模一样
They definitely got the look.

1577
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:09,760
中情局的都是戴墨镜的笨蛋
Assholes and windshield sunglasses, practically CIA uniform.

1578
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:11,765
伙计们还想要什么吗？
Can I get you boys anything else?

1579
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,086
有好吃的甜甜圈吗？
Are your doughnuts any good?

1580
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,566
说实话吧 很可怕
Tell you the truth, they're pretty lousy.

1581
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,882
听到你那句我们是多么开心
Can't tell you how happy we are to hear that.

1582
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:23,126
注意
You take care.

1583
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:24,401
我看到了
I saw that.

1584
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:25,891
－ 看到什么  - 你眨眼了
- Saw what?  - You winked.

1585
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:27,530
- 这是眼角抽动  - 是的 没错
- That's a twitch.  - Yeah, right.

1586
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:34,523
对于一个 炸毁4300美元的人来说
You know, for a guy who just blew up $43 million,

1587
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:36,648
你太大方了
all of a sudden, you are a very generous tipper.

1588
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,007
谁说我炸毁了4300万？
Who said I blew up $43 million?

1589
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:41,841
你说什么呢？
What are you sayin'?

1590
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:43,160
我什么也没说 你听到什么了？
I'm not sayin' anything. What are you hearing?

1591
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,163
你话里有话
I'm hearin' somethin'. You're sayin' somethin'.

1592
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,208
你若听到 那是因为内心希望听到
Well, if you're hearin' it, it's only because you're hearin' it,

1593
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,726
而不是因为我说了什么
not 'cause I'm sayin' it.

1594
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,290
你留着多少钱？
How much did you keep?

1595
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,486
200万？
Two million?

1596
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,084
每人100万
That's like one each.

1597
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:57,400
你现在又想来平分？
So now you get half?

1598
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,608
- 我射倒了一半人  - 又怎样？
- Well, I shot half the guys.  - So?

1599
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,211
200万？
Two million?
