这种优势正受犹太人的威胁。
A Pathological anti-Semite, Hitler has also taken on the mission of setting the superiority of Germanic-Aryan race, menaced by the jews.

对他来说，一战，德国的战败，通货膨胀，失业这些都应归罪于犹太人。
For him, the jews was the cause of the great war, Germany's defeat, infation and unemployment.

"because we're no great friend with Boche."

The Boche was a pejorative term for the German soldiers during the previous war.

"My parents thought so as well."

人数上是2比1。

因为法军人数比英军要多。

203
00:19:19,100--> 00:19:21,000
英国人也认为这场战争不会真的开打

208
00:19:46,880--> 00:19:48,880
好让法国重新武装起来。
in order to rearm the country.

209
00:19:49,880--> 00:19:55,000
马其诺防线为前战争部长安德里.马其诺所建
The Maginot Line is a work of former minister of war, André Maginot

防线花了近十年建造
It took nearly ten years to construct 

212
00:20:03,200--> 00:20:06,900
并整整耗去150万立方米混凝土

The French military command thought the German tanks could never cross this extremly rough terrain.

220
00:20:35,290--> 00:20:38,700
法国没有将防线一路延伸至海边。
The French didn't extend the line all the way to the sea.

221
00:20:38,999--> 00:20:41,999
因为比利时在宣布中立前为法国的盟友
Because Belgium before the declaration of its neutrality was an ally with France.

222
00:20:42,999--> 00:20:43,999
而且对此表示反对。

This northern part of the front is mend by the French army and the British expeditionary forces

"We're gonna hang out the washing on the Siegfried Line."

230
00:21:25,200--> 00:21:30,000
“因为洗衣服的日子到了。”
"Cause the washing day is here."

231
00:21:31,200--> 00:21:38,400
齐格菲防线是由希特勒建起的加固防线，面对马其诺防线。
The Siegfried Line is the strengthened fortifications constructed by Hitler, facing the Maginot Line.

232
00:21:39,200--> 00:21:41,200
德国人不会进攻
The Germans don't attack 

233
00:21:41,400--> 00:21:44,400
他们仍然设法避免出现第二条战线。
They still try to avoid the second front.

234
00:21:47,400--> 00:21:49,800
尽管如此，法国人仍采取了预防措施，
The French neverthless take some precaution,

235
00:21:50,000--> 00:21:58,400
他们将阿尔萨斯和洛林的民众疏散至西南部的佩里格尔和夏朗德地区。
they evacuate the population of Alsace and Lorraine to the regions of Peiligeer and Charente in the southwest.

236
00:22:00,900--> 00:22:04,900
斯特拉斯堡，成了一座鬼城
Strasbourg, a ghost town

237
00:22:05,900--> 00:22:10,900
她被民众所遗弃，变得毫无生气。

238
00:22:11,900--> 00:22:15,900
尤其是那些犹太教堂
Especially that of synagogues

239
00:22:27,900--> 00:22:29,500
华沙 
1939年9月20日

这座城市被德军包围但仍在坚持。
The city is surrounded but still holding out.

“这个国家仍将是个中立国家”
"This nation will remain a neutral nation "

251
00:23:41,100--> 00:23:48,100
“但我无法要求每个美国人在思考方面也保持中立。”
"But I cannot ask that every American remain neutral in thought as well"

252
00:23:48,300--> 00:23:53,100
“甚至中立者也有权考虑事实。”
"Even a neutral has a right to take account of facts"

253
00:23:53,600--> 00:24:00,100
“甚至中立者也不能被要求封闭他的内心或是他的良知。”
"Even a neutral cannot be asked to close his mind or to close his conscience."

254
00:24:02,600--> 00:24:06,700
华沙被炸显出这些城市有多脆弱。

262
00:25:12,500--> 00:25:14,700
甚至马也是。

263
00:25:21,500--> 00:25:26,700
与此同时波兰被无情地瓜分殆尽。
Meanwhile Poland is ruthlessly carved up.

00:25:46,500--> 00:25:52,700
按照之前与希特勒协商好的，苏联军队入侵东部波兰。
As previously agreed with Hitler, the Soviet has invaded the eastern half of Poland.

265
00:25:52,990--> 00:25:56,700
在这里德苏军人称兄道弟
Here German and Soviet soldiers are fraternizing 

266
00:25:56,900--> 00:25:59,400
真是矛盾的一幕啊。

267
00:25:59,900--> 00:26:02,400
纳粹发送传单其中读到：

00:26:02,700--> 00:26:06,100
“德国军队向工农红军致敬”

波兰军队投降德国
The Polish Army surrenders to the Germans

271 
00:26:16,100--> 00:26:18,900
而在东面则是向苏联。
and in the east to the Soviet.

272
00:26:22,800--> 00:26:28,200
斯大林于是下令处决两万波兰战俘。
Stalin then orders the execution of twenty thousand Polish prisoners.  

273
00:26:35,800--> 00:26:40,200

In 1992, the president of post-Soviet Russia, Boris Yeltsin

280
00:27:26,400--> 00:27:28,200

281
00:27:28,500--> 00:27:34,200
一份由斯大林自己签署处决的命令原件。
with an original order of execution signed by Stalin himself.

282
00:27:38,500--> 00:27:44,200
通过占据半个波兰，斯大林实际上已落入了希特勒的圈套中
Stalin by occupying half of Poland is in fact playing into the hands of Hitler

283
00:27:44,500--> 00:27:50,200
希特勒需要与苏联的共同边界以便实行侵苏计划。

Hitler and Himmler, the head of SS, will now take care of Poland

285
00:27:57,500--> 00:28:03,200
他们任命纳粹党人汉斯.弗兰克为波兰占领省份的总督。
by naming the Nazi Hans Frank Governor General of the occupied Polish provinces 

286
00:28:03,500--> 00:28:10,200
弗兰克宣称:“我握有对所有的波兰人的生杀大权。”
who claims, "I have the power of life and death over the Polish people."

287
00:28:14,200--> 00:28:16,200

After the war, he will be tried in Nuremberg 
 
288
00:28:16,300--> 00:28:19,200 
并以反人类罪被处以绞刑。

00:28:28,300--> 00:28:33,400 
一位德国人摄下了这些被拘于围栏里的吉普赛人
These gipsies held in pens are filmed by a German

290
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,200 
对于纳粹来说，他们已经不是人了。
For the Nazis, they are non persons.

291
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,200 
妇女将被强制接受结扎手术
The women will be forced to undergo a Sterilization

292
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,440 
因为他们不配有权生儿育女。
because they do not deserve to reproduce.

293
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,440 
纳粹宣布公开抓捕吉普赛人。

294
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:56,440

295
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,440 
犹太人民的苦难开始了
The ordeal over the Jewish people begins

296
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,440
纳粹现在发现已有300万波兰犹太人处于他们的统治下。
The Nazis now have three million Polish Jews at their mercy

297
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,440
希特勒仍不确定如何处置他们
Hitler is still uncertain about what to do with them

298
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,999
只要战争对他来说进展顺利
As long as the war is going well for him, 

299
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,840
他考虑把他们流放到东方或是用船把他们运到马达加斯加。
he considers deporting them to the east or even shipping them to Madagascar.

300
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,990 
只有当战争结局变得不明朗时 
It's only when the outcome of the war becomes less certain

301
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,990
希特勒与其同伙将开始宣泄他们狂乱的仇恨和杀戮
that Hitler and his complices unleash a frenzy of hate and murder 

302
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,990
那就是“最终解决方案”
The Final Solution

303
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,990
此时，犹太人都要被辨认出来。
For the time being, the Jews have to be identified,

304
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,990
标上黄星作为标记
marked with a yellow star  

305 
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,190
并被集中到犹太区内。
and herded into the ghettoes 

306
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,190
他们中的一些被完全用墙隔离。
some of which are completely walled off. 

307
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:09,690
其中一位不幸受难者在日记里写道 
From the diary of one of these unfortunate souls  

309
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:15,690
“看着眼前可耻的罪行和暴力令人心碎。”
"It's heartrending to see shameful sins and violence take place before our eyes"

310
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:20,690
“小恶棍们就在外面的大街上殴打妇女和老人”
"Women and the elderly beaten right out in the street by petty thugs"

311
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,990
“我的眼中充满了泪水。”
"Tears come to my eyes"

312
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:28,690
“我们的无能为力和孤立无援暴露无遗”
"our powerlessness, our isolation is there to see right in open"

313
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,999
“完全没人向我们伸出援手。”
"when not a single person takes us a defense. "
	
314
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,199
“我们好弱啊。”
"We are so weak."

315 
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:42,199
波兰所有主要城市都将设立犹太人隔离区
All the major cities in Poland will have their ghetto prisons

316
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,199
罗兹犹太区

317
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:46,599
来自德国，奥地利，捷克的犹太人也将拘押在此。
where German, Austrian and Czech Jews will also be interned.

318
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:56,599
犹太人在这仍自信也许某一天他们能返回故土。
The Jews here still feel confident that perhaps someday they will be able to return to their homes 

319
00:30:56,899 --> 00:31:01,599
他们不知道自己即将因冻饿而死。
They don't know that they will die of hunger and cold.

320
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:05,599
他们不知道毒气淋浴室的大门即将向他们打开。
They don't know the shower is about to begin.

321
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,599
犹太人居住地
禁止进入

322
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:21,199
华沙已成废墟。
Warsaw is in ruins.

323
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:23,999
希特勒来到华沙以让一队宣传工作人员为其拍摄，
Hitler comes to be filmed by the a propaganda crew,

324
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:28,199
他们乘在移动的轿车上从后方朝着希特勒这边进行拍摄。
seeing here, travelling in the car and the background.

325
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:41,499
这些胜利的德国士兵随着《近卫军进行曲》踏着正步。
These victorious German soldiers march their Goose step to the song of Grenadiers March

326
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:45,199
但在波兰战役期间，他们的作战效率过于低下
But they were too inefficient during the Polish campaign
  
327
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:50,199
准备不足，缺乏战斗精神，甚至有时开小差
Poor preparation, a lack of fighting spirit, even cases indiscipline

328
00:31:50,499 --> 00:31:57,199
总司令勃劳希契就这样大胆向元首作了汇报。
On the points, the commanding chief, general von Brauchitsch does report to the führer. 

329
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:01,199
沃尔特・冯・勃劳希契

330
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:05,799
希特勒对此大发雷霆。
Hitler is furious.

331
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:11,199
但他不为疑虑所影响并下令准备对西面发动进攻。
But he is immune to doubt and orders the attack on the west to be prepared

332
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:15,199
进攻荷兰，比利时和法国。
And attack Netherlands, Belgium and France. 

334
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:18,389
某些将军这么做是疯狂的。
Some of the generals think it's madness.

335
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:22,389
其中一些人开始密谋推翻元首。
Some of them begin plotting to overthrow the führer. 

336
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,589
这是关键时刻。
This is the crucial moment.

337 
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:28,389
历史进程正处在紧要关头。
The course of history lies in the balance.

338
00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:35,389	
1939年11月89日，希特勒惊险逃过暗杀行动。
November 8th, 1939, Hitler narrowly escapes from a assassination attempt.

339
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:39,389		
似乎仿佛他受到了上天的某种保护。
It seems as if he enjoyed some kind of divine protection.

340
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:42,389	
当他参加遇难者的葬礼时
When he attends the funeral for the victims 

341
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:44,389	
已经变了一个人。
He's no long the same man.

342
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:50,389	
他对军队和德国人民的影响力甚至变得更大。
His power over the army and the Germany people has grown even stronger.

343
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:53,389	
他告诉他的将军

344
00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:57,589	
“我的决定不可改变。时机一到我就进攻法国。”
"My decision is revocable. I will attack France when the time is right."

345
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:01,389	
“不成功便成仁。”
"I will be victorious or die in the attempt."

346
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:06,000	
但希特勒对进攻西方仍感到不确定。
Yet Hitler is still uncertain about attacking the west,

346
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:07,600	
因为他也说：
for he also says, 

347
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,600	
“战争就像打开黑暗房间的门。”
"War is like openning a door of dark room."

348
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,900	
“你永远不知道会发生什么事。”
"You'll never know what will happen."

349
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,900	
最终，他延迟了进攻命令
Eventually, he postpones the order to attack 

350
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:27,900	
回到他在阿尔卑斯的行馆与他的情妇伊娃布劳恩相会。
and goes back to his Shelley in the Alps to join his mistress, Eva Braun.

351
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,900	
她拍下了这段希特勒随员的影片。
She shot this footage of Hitler's entourage 

352
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,100	
帝国建筑师施佩尔
of the Reich's architect, Albert Speer

353 
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,100	
常和希特勒散很长的步。
who goes for long walks with Hitler.

354
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400	
施佩尔回忆道：
Speer recalls,

355
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,400	
“希特勒想把柏林重命名为‘日尔曼尼亚’。”
"Hitler wanted to rechristen Berlin 'Germania'."

356
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:53,400	
“我们已备好未来希特勒广场的模型，
而广场圆顶的灵感来自罗马圣彼得大教堂。”
"We are ready to have mocked up the future Adolf Hitler Square with a dome inspired by San Peters in Rome

357
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,500
“但比它大十七倍。”
but seventeen times bigger.

358
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,500
我对他说：“元首，这不会成为轰炸机的理想目标吗。”
I said to him, "My führer, wouldn't that make a ideal target for bombers."

359
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:08,500
他答道：“一点也不会。
戈林已向我保证任何一架敌机都无法飞跃帝国领空。”
He answered, "Not at all. Galin has assured me that no enemy aircraft will ever fly over the reich."

360
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:18,500
未来的德国军官卡根尼克在兵营里写信给母亲：
From his barracks, the future German officer, Auguste Von Kaganick, writes to his mother,

361

“我们全都渴望战斗。”
"We are all eager to fight."

362
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,500
“我们已做好战争准备。”
"We are ready for battle."

363
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,500
他的母亲回信道：“这是场罪恶的战争。”

364
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,500
“而我们将为之付出代价。”
"And we are going to have to pay for it. "

365
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,500
战争这时进入一个怪诞的阶段
The war then enters a new bizarre phase. 

366
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,990
德国人称之为“静坐战争”。
The Germans call it der Sitzkrieg/the sitting war 

367
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,500
英国人称之为“虚假战争”。
The British call it the phoney war

368 
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,500
而法国人则视之“可笑战争”。
And for the French, it's Drole de guerre/the funny war. 

369
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,100
这漫长奇怪的等待时期
A long strange waiting period

370
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,100
对妇女来说尤其艰辛
especially hard on the women

371
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,100
对她们来说不仅要承受战争带来的极大痛苦
For them, there is not only the anguish of the war

372
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,100
还得担忧家人的安危。
but also the survival of their families to worry about.

373
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:29,100
就像上次大战一样，士兵们挖着战壕并设法充分利用一切。
As in the last war, the soldiers dig in and try to make the best of things.

374
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,400
法国士兵加斯通.席黑克写信给妻子：
The French soldier, Jastone Schiller, writes to his wife,

375
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,400

"It's thirty degrees below zero, the bread is frozen."

376
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,800
“我是幸运儿中的一个，他们给了我们些稻草。”
"I'm one of the lucky ones, they gave us some straw."

377
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,400
“有了它，我们能睡得好些。”
"And with that, we can sleep better."
 
378
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:50,900
1939到1940年的冬天确实是本世纪最冷的冬天之一
The winter of 1939 and 1940 is indeed one of the coldest in the certury

379
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,400
雪上加霜的是，这场战争的所有冬天都是酷寒的。
to make the bad situation worse, all the winters of this war will be brutally cold. 

380
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,400
总司令甘默林期望德国经比利时进攻
The commanding chief, general Gamelin, is expecting Germans to attack through Belgium.

381
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,700
进而穿越这片开阔的平原前往法国。
and move towards Paris acorss this open plain.

382
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,200
就像1914年那次。
Like in 1914.

甘默林计划让法军在比利时的土地上抵抗德国。

In France, colonel de Gaulle, a tank officer who's beginning to make a name for himself criticize this strategy.

385
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,200
他称之为“马其诺防线心态”
He calls it the-maginal-Line mentality

386
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,700 
也就是等待另一方采取行动。
which consists in waiting for the other side to make a move.

387
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,700 
在他的著作《建立职业军》中

388 
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:12,700 
他辩证支持大量使用坦克发动进攻

389
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,700 
法国月产300辆坦克
France is producing three hundred tanks a month 

390
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,700 
但它们都被分配到下属各部来支援步兵
But they are being disbursed into all the sections to back up the infantry.

391
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,200
法国的航空工业也落于人后。
French aviation has also fallen behind.

392
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,300 
法国从美国订购了四千架飞机
France orders four thousand plants from the United States. 

393
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,300 
尽管后者国内孤立主义的趋势愈来愈盛。
in spite of the ever-growing isolationist trend

394
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,300 
支持孤立主义的查尔斯.林白
championed by Charles Lindbergh

395
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,100 
曾是首位单人驾机跨越大西洋的英雄
the hero who made the first transatlantic solo flight

396
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,100 
而现在则是美国第一运动的主要倡议者。

397
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,500 
“如果你相信美国的命运应是独立的。”

00:38:59,100  --> 00:39:04,400
“我们要求你站在她的立场加入美国第一委员会。”
"We ask you to join the America-First committee in its stand. "

400
00:39:04,900  --> 00:39:07,400
这是美国孤立主义者的声音
It's the isolationist voice of America
 
401 
00:39:07,900  --> 00:39:13,400
也是反犹汽车制造者亨利福特等公众名人的想法
and the public personalities like Henry Ford, the anti-Semitic car-maker

402
00:39:15,100  --> 00:39:21,400

or like Joseph Kennedy, American ambassador in London who is anti war

403
00:39:21,800  --> 00:39:28,400
而他的儿子，未来的肯尼迪总统则支持欧洲民主国家。	
while his son John, the future president Kennedy supports European democracies.

404
00:39:30,800  --> 00:39:38,400
美国的纳粹的支持者们也促成了1940年初充斥社会的狂热氛围
Nazi sympathizers in America also contribute to the impassioned climate that reigns at the beginning of 1940.

405
00:39:40,800  --> 00:39:44,400
在欧洲，英国的法西斯联盟也相当活跃。
In Europe, the British union of Fascists are also quite active.

406

Oswald Mosley, the English führer, challenges the goverment right in the centre of London. 

408
00:39:53,000  --> 00:39:56,800
之后数年他将呆在监狱里。
He will spend next several years in prison.

409
00:40:07,000  --> 00:40:11,800
莫斯利演讲驱使人们走上街头来停止战争。
Mosley's speeches urge people to get out on the streets and stop the war.

410
00:40:15,000  --> 00:40:18,800
但丘吉尔已掌管英国政府。
But Winston Churchill has taken the reigns of English goverment.

411

416
00:40:39,499  --> 00:40:42,800
法国正准备拍出他的精英战士

法国外籍兵团
the French foreign legion

一个世纪来，外籍兵团一直不记前嫌吸纳世界各地的恶棍
The foreign legion, for a century, it's been taking in the world reprobates no matter what they have passed

419
00:40:53,199  --> 00:40:55,100
只要名声不要太臭就行了。
as long as it's not too shitty.

420
00:40:59,499  --> 00:41:02,300
他们驻扎在阿尔及利亚的西迪贝勒阿巴斯 。
They have quarters in Sidi Bel Abbès, in Algeria.

421
00:41:02,500  --> 00:41:05,300
现在签下了许多西班牙共和党人

having fled from their country after Franco's Facist victory.

The legion has embarked at Brest, along with the well-equipped Chasseurs Alpins

426

427
00:41:38.600  --> 00:41:43,400

But Finland and the Soviet Union sign a peace treaty.

428
00:41:44.100  --> 00:41:48,400
几天之后，希特勒对丹麦和挪威发动进攻。
A few days later, Hitler launchs his offensive against Denmark and Norway.

429
00:41:50.100  --> 00:41:52,400
闪电战。

国防军两日内占领奥斯陆。

希特勒正寻求保护铁矿运输线。

432
00:42:02.600  --> 00:42:05,400
铁对于德国作战是不可或缺的。
Iron is indispensable to the German war effort. 

433
00:42:05.444  --> 00:42:11,400
而瑞典铁矿石的一半经由挪威的纳维克港运出。
And fifty percent of the swedish Iron ore is shipped out of the Norwegian port of Narvik.

矿路暂时被切断。

437
00:42:39.144  --> 00:42:41,770
这场胜利提升了法国士气

348
00:42:42.144  --> 00:42:44,100
并使他们更相信自己的格言。

00:42:44,300  --> 00:42:46,992
“我们会赢，因为我们是最强的。”
"We'll win, because we are the strongest."

350
00:42:47,300  --> 00:42:50,192
但是远征军将不得不放弃纳维克。
But the expeditionary corps will have to abandon Narvik.

351
00:42:50,200  --> 00:42:55,192
接下来直到战争结束，一车又一车的瑞典铁矿石
And for the rest of the war, trainload after trainload of Swedish iron ore

352
00:42:55,400  --> 00:42:58,192
将一直喂饱德国的战争机器。
will feed the German war machine.

353
00:42:59,300  --> 00:43:06,192
法国人尽数撤回国内，因为德国刚在西线发动了攻势。
The French are broad back home for the Germans just launch their offensive in the west. 
 
354

向西驶往位于法国边界附近的新指挥部。
heading west towards new headquarters near the French border.

00:43:19,900  --> 00:43:25,192
希特勒宣布：“先生们，进攻才刚开始。”
Hitler announces, "Gentlemen, the offensive has just begun."

他的将军在冬季期间向他呈上了作战计划。
His generals have submitted him the battle plan during the winter 

358
00:43:35,900  --> 00:43:38,192

359
00:43:38,900  --> 00:43:40,192
经由比利时进攻

360
00:43:41,900  --> 00:43:44,192
但希特勒偏爱冯曼因施坦将军想法。
But Hitler preferred the general von Manstein's idea

361
00:43:45,300  --> 00:43:47,192
直穿阿登森林

362 
00:43:48,300  --> 00:43:51,192
然后挥师北上直达大海。

363 
00:43:51,300  --> 00:43:56,192
以“镰割”攻势将盟军包围。
encircling the allies with a sickle-cut movement

364
00:43:56,300  --> 00:43:58,592
但此“镰割”攻势实属一场豪赌。
But this sickle-cut movement is in fact a huge gamble.

365
00:43:58,900  --> 00:44:02,592
因为盟军可能会掉头反击。
Because the allies could turn back and counterattack

366
00:44:03,111  --> 00:44:05,592
然而希特勒却自信满满
However Hitler is confident

367
00:44:05,811  --> 00:44:08,592
他心里明白主要是天气要好。
He knows the main thing is to have a good weather.

368
00:44:10,811  --> 00:44:13,592
1940年5月10日

369
00:44:14,811  --> 00:44:18,592
中尉卡根尼克断言：

“我们是国防军，大德国的军队。”
"We are the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of great Germany."

371
00:44:23,211  --> 00:44:25,992
“吾师必胜。”
"Victory is certain."

372
00:44:47,811  --> 00:44:51,992
对于德国军人来说，自己的祖国正处于危险之中。
For the German soldiers, their homeland is in danger.

373
00:44:52,111  --> 00:44:56,492
毕竟是法国向德国宣的战。
After all, it was French who declare war on Germany.

374
00:44:58,111  --> 00:45:04,492
1940年5月10日黎明时分，德国伞兵空降荷兰。
The 10th of May 1940, at dawn the German parachutists make jump over Holand

00:45:05,492  --> 00:45:09,492
他们受命夺取鹿特丹周边的机场和桥梁。
Their mission is to capture the airfields and bridges around Rotterdam.

376
00:45:10,492  --> 00:45:15,492
与此同时，希特勒出动大军杀向比利时。

希特勒等待着。
Hitler waits.

378
00:45:24,492  --> 00:45:29,492
盟军是否会落入陷阱之中？
