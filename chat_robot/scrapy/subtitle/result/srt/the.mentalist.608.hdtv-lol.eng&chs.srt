那就好
All right then.

144
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,860
但我不是你们的头儿了 这正是重点
But I am not your boss anymore. That's the point.

145
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,600
我们孤军奋斗了
We're on our own.

146
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,360
好 明白了
Yeah, we get it.

147
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,160
那他在哪呢?
So where is he?

148
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
加利福尼亚 萨克拉门托 威廉地方公园

149
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,060
嘿
Hey.

150
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,730
嘿
Hey.

151
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,560
你被通缉了
You're a wanted man.

152
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,460
我希望如此
Well, I like to think so.

153
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,000
是真的 Abbott真的对你发布了通缉令
Seriously. Abbott put an actual warrant out on you.

154
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,760
呃 又不是第一次了
Eh. It's not the first time.

155
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,460
你是要告诉我 还是怎样?
So you gonna tell me, or what?

156
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,860
是的 呃... Bertram给我电话了
Oh, yeah. Uh... Bertram called me.

157
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,000
- 我知道  - 嗯
- I know.  - Mm.

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,400
他说什么了?
What did he say?

159
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,530
不管他想说什么 都没来得及说
Well, whatever he wanted to say, he didn't have time.

160
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,600
他为什么还在这?
Why the hell is he still here?

161
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,030
他想干什么?
What does he want?

162
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,600
我猜他很快会再打电话告诉我的
I'm guessing he'll call back soon and tell me.

163
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,260
你的手机不安全 联邦调查局...
Your phone's not safe. The FBI...

164
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,230
对 他们可以监听电话
Yeah, they have a tap on the line.

165
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,560
但他们还没追踪到我
But they don't have a trace yet.

166
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,730
如果他们追踪到了 那早就逮捕我了
If they had a trace, then I'd be arrested already.

167
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,160
或许吧 但迟早他们会追踪到你的
Maybe so, but sooner or later, they'll get a trace on you.

168
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,630
我知道
I know.

169
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,560
但Bertram来电之前我不能把手机扔了
But I can't get rid of my phone until Bertram calls.

170
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,830
非常让人焦虑不安
It's all very suspenseful. 

171
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,330
- 他想干嘛?  - 谁?
- What does he want?  - Who?

172
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,400
- Bertram  - 我们会知道的
- Bertram.  - We'll see.

173
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,060
你这是在含糊其辞了
Now you're being evasive.

174
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,960
鸟儿们的小眼睛真是晶亮如珠
What beady little eyes birds have.

175
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,330
就像小恐龙的眼睛 你知道吗?
Tiny dinosaurs, you know?

176
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,530
我知道
I know.

177
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,330
我知道你知道他想干什么
I know you know what he wants.

178
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,900
他想干什么?
What does he want?

179
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,760
- 喂?  - 抱歉刚刚挂你电话
- Hello?  - Oh, sorry I had to hang up on you.

180
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,330
今天太忙了
It's been a busy day.

181
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,730
没关系 你知道 这手机不安全
Yeah, no problem. You know, this phone is not safe.

182
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,130
我一会回你电话
Let me call you back in a moment.

183
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,230
好
Yeah.

184
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,600
他说什么?
What'd he say?

185
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,730
等一下
Just a second.

186
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,230
嘿 近来如何?
Hey. How you doing?

187
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,700
- 我出100块买你手机  - 什么?
- I'll give you $100 for that phone.  - Huh?

188
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,930
200块买你手机
$200 for that phone.

189
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,030
耍什么花样?
What's the catch?

190
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,460
没花样
No catch.

191
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,900
300块加上...
$300 plus...

192
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,700
替换的手机
a replacement phone.

193
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,600
好吧
Uh, okay. 

194
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,460
哥们 一会儿打给你
Dude, I'll call you right back.

195

很高兴跟你做生意
Pleasure doing business with you.

196
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,400
谢啦 哥们
Thanks, man.

197
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,530
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

198
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,560
他说什么了?
What did he say?

199
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,060
喂?
Hello?

200
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,060
听着 我们应该见面谈谈
Look, I think we should meet and talk.

201
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,000
- 就我们两个  - 约会吗?
- Just the two of us.  - What, like a date?

202
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,830
呵呵...
Yes...

203
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,160
不是
No.

204
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,030
听着 游戏结束了
Look, the game is over.

205
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,160
我认为是非常精彩的平局
I'd call it a very honorable tie.

206
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,730
既然都结束了
And now that it's over,

207
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,060
我真的觉得我们该谈谈
I really think that we should talk.

208
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,100
休战 不带武器 没有诡计
You know, a truce. No weapons, no tricks.

209
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,630
就是谈谈
Just talk.

210
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,100
然后我们都平安离去
Then we both walk away.

211
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,860
谈话 谈什么?
Talk. About what?

212
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,800
谈谈... 所有事
Well... everything.

213
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,230
我觉得我们都需要一个了结 不是吗?
I think we both could use a little closure, don't you?

214
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,930
必须是今天 你懂的 最好是现在
It has to be today. You know, now.

215
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,700
我时间很紧
I'm kind of pressed for time.

216
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,500
我怎么知道我能相信你?
How do I know I can trust you?

217
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,760
现在别这么胆小 Patrick
Ah, don't be timid now, Patrick.

218
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,400
有很多次我都可以杀你的 但我没有 对吧?
I could have killed you many times, and I haven't, have I?

219
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,600
好吧 时间地点?
Okay. When and where?

220
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,160

Excellent.

There's too many cops.

225
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,760

You know Alexandria Cemetery?

226

当然知道
Of course I do.

227
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,800
在西门附近有个小教堂

Half an hour.

231

他怎么说?
What'd he say?

232
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,460
他想和我见面
He wants to meet with me.

233
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,930
是个陷阱
It's a trap.

234
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,960
可能吧
Probably. 

235
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,730
那你打算怎么办?
Well, what are you gonna do?

236

You can't.

238
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,000
相信我 我知道自己在做什么
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,500
Jane 别这么做 好好想想
Jane, don't do this. Think about it.

240
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,130
联邦调查局很快就能抓到Bertram了
The FBI is gonna get Bertram soon enough.

241
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,460
我不想让联邦调查局抓到他
I don't want the FBI to get him.

242

I'm gonna need to borrow your gun.

248

My gun?

249
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,830
没错 你的枪 我不会用的
Yes, your gun. I'm not gonna use it.

250
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,960
只是个道具
Just a prop.

251
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,860
Teresa 请相信我 相信我就好

Where's the man in charge here? Where is Abbott?

256
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,830
跪下
Get down on your knees.

257
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,160
把手举起来
Keep your hands where I can see them.

258
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,830
Abbott在哪儿? 我... 我得走了
Where is Abbott? I... I have to go.

259
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:42,300

All right, take it down a notch, people.

260
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,060
他又不是黑帮教父
He's not Al Capone.

261
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,160
Abbott 请听我说
Abbott, please listen to me.

262
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,300
我看得出来你是个有荣誉感的人
I can tell that you're a man of honor.

263
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,000
我以我的名誉发誓 一个小时后我就会去自首
On my honor, I will give myself up in an hour.

Just...

266
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,260

For what?

272
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,760

Where are you going?

273
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,200
你要见谁?
Who are you gonna go meet?

274
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,230
不说?
No?

275
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,360

Well, let's take a trip downtown, shall we?

276
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,630

我们同为警察 帮我个忙 Abbott
Do me this one favor, Abbott, cop to cop.

280
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,000

Let him go, and I swear I will bring him back later.

281
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,900
想都别想
Not happening.

282
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,830
我现在看到的紧急状况到底是什么?
And what is all this urgency I'm hearing here?

283
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,300
你和Bertram有约
Oh. You made a plan with Bertram.

284
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,000
是这样吗? 是不是这样?
Is that it? Is that what you did?

285
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,460
拜托了 Abbott
Please, Abbott.

286
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,360
联邦调查局! 退后!
FBI! Back it off!

287
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,060
- 加州调查局 你才要退后  - 怎么回事?
- CBI. Back it up yourself.  - What's this?

288
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,200
放他走 Abbott 他没做错任何事
Let him go, Abbott. He's done nothing wrong.

289
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,060
嘿 伙计们
Hey, guys.

290
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,900
要知道... 很高兴见到你们
You know, i... it's good to see you.

291
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,360
我不想扫你们的兴 但已经没有加州调查局了
I hate to bring you down, but there is no CBI.

292
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,930
那个警徽跟玩具无异
That badge is a toy,

293
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,100
你们也都在假扮执法人员
and you're all impersonating officers of the law.

294
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,460
随便了 放他走
Whatever. Let him go.

295
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,300
你们在挑衅我吗?
Are you mad-dogging me right now?

296
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,900
联邦调查局?
The FBI?

297
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,000
你说自己是合法的联邦调查局探员 我们怎么知道?
You say you're legit FBI, but how do we know?

298
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,630
没错 就我们所知 你也可能是布雷克组织的
Yeah, you could be members of the Blake Association

299
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,960
一份子
for all we know.

300
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,030
我们不是
We're not.

301
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,260
证明给我们看
Prove it.

302
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,800
你们的那位Reede Smith就是成员 为什么你就不可能?
Your man Reede Smith was a member. Why not you?

303
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,860
我们怎么知道Jane没有身处险境?
And how do we know Jane's not in danger?

304
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,960
这是冒犯
That's absurd.

305
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,460
我很抱歉 Abbott探员
I'm sorry, Agent Abbott,

306
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,260
但在确保他的安全之前
but it is our duty to protect this man

307
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,560
保护他是我们的职责
until we're assured his safety.

308
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,230
嘿 放他走
Hey. Let him go.

309
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,930
别举着枪
No, no, no, no, no.

310
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,500
没事的 别激动
It's all right. Just stand down.

311
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,200
大家别激动 不需要发生冲突 没事的
Stand down, guys. No bloodshed required. It's cool.

312
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,900
放他走
Let him go.

313
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,660
开我的车走
Take my car.

314
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,830
长官?
Sir?

315
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,100
算了
It's okay.

316
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,360
谢谢 伙计们!
Thank you, guys!

317
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,660
结束了?
We done?

318
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,900
他走了 结束了
He's gone. We're done.

319
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,660
逮捕他们
Arrest them.

320
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,930
慢慢把你们的枪...
Put your guns down on the ground...

321
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,000
放到地上
slowly.

322
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,260
照他说的做
Do as he says.

323
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,100
追踪Lisbon探员的车
Go track Agent Lisbon's vehicle.

324
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,100
明白 长官
Yes, Sir.

325
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,500
你在我的车上放了追踪器?
You put a bug on my car?

326
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,760
你觉得我们怎么找到Jane的?
How do you think we found Jane?

327
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,600
我说我很高兴见到你们
I said I was glad to see you people

328
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,300
是因为我知道你们会搞砸
because I knew you would screw up

329
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,200
这样我就会轻松了
and make my life easy.

330
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,530
你们也照做了
And you did just that.

331
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,560
谢谢
Thank you.

332
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,260
逮捕她
Arrest her.

333
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,760

他还没准备好
He wasn't ready for it.

335
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,960
不
No.

336
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,860
哟 哟 看看!
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Check it out. Whoa!

337
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,500
看看!
Check this out.

338
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,600
怎么了?
What's up?

339
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,760
能不能拜托你们帮我看一下车?
Uh, could you guys keep an eye on my car for me, please?

340
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,530
好的 我会看着的
Sure, I'll watch it.

341
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,760
谢谢
Thank you.

342
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,030
走吧
Let's go.

343
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,530
伙计 不客气
Yeah, man, no worries.

344
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,800
是啊! 哈哈哈!
Yeah! Ha ha ha ha!

345
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,300
你好
Hey there.

346
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,500
呃...
Uh...

347
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,930
很抱歉打扰你了 女士
sorry to bother you, ma'am.

348
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,430
说来话长
Uh, long story.

349
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,430
如果你愿意... 我想搭个顺风车
Uh, I need... I need a ride, if you're willing.

350
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,030
这里是第四小队 我们看到目标车辆了
This is unit 4. We have the vehicle in sight,

351
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,600
停在第五街和Sherman街路口
stationary on Fifth and Sherman.

352
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,660
隐蔽 隐蔽 他们可能在那儿会面
Stay back, stay back. This could be the meet. 

353
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:36,000
怎么回事?
What the heck?

354
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,160
第四小队 怎么回事?
Unit 4, what's the situation? 

355
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,730
第四小队 回话 该死
Unit 4, respond, damn it. 

356
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,860
头儿 Lisbon车里是一群小孩
Boss, it was some kids in Lisbon's car.

357
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,300
Jane不见了
Jane wasn't there.

358
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,530
Jane不在这儿 重复 Jane不在这儿
We don't have Jane. Repeat. We don't have Jane.

359
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,530
听到吗...
Do you co... 

360
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,460
别再加深自己的罪孽了
Don't dig yourself any deeper.

361
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,700
他去了哪儿?
Where did he go?

362
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,200
我不知道
I don't know.

363
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,230
你们还真是大义凛然 是吧?
You guys really have a death wish, don't you?

364
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,660
长官 我们真的不知道
Sir, we really don't know.

365
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,700
"长官"? 你干嘛要叫他"长官"?
"Sir"? Why the hell are you calling him "Sir"?

366
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,300
冷静点 头号公敌
Oh, calm down, Dillinger.

367
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,130
我们被逮捕了 也许应该文明点
We're under arrest here. We might as well be civil.

368
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,530
为什么? 你觉得这就能弄到个好牢房?
Why? You think you'll get a nicer cell?

369
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,330
谢谢你 Aurelio
Muchas gracias, Aurelio.

370
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,160
别客气 祝你好运
De nada. Buena suerte.

371
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,800
嘿 Patrick
Hey, Patrick.

372
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,460
我得搜你身 以防你带了武器
I'm gonna need to search you for weapons.

373
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,260
所以你可以把手举起来了
So you can go ahead, put your hands up.

374
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,600
总得试试
Worth a shot.

375
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,130
现在可以进去了
You can go in now.

376
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,430
嘿 Patrick
Patrick.

377
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,760
谢谢你这么准时
Thank you for being so punctual.

378
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,230
你骗了我
You lied to me.

379
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,000
哦... 你也骗了我
Oh. Well... as did you.

380
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,330
我们真是对顽皮的家伙 对吧?
What a couple of scamps we are, huh?

381
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:19,260
我保证 那是我说的最后一个谎
I promise that is the last lie that I will ever tell you.

382
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,100
好了... 先说重点
So...  first things first.

383
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,830
你和联邦调查局犯了个打错
You and the Feds have made a big mistake.

384
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,030
我不是红约翰
I'm not Red John.

385
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,330
什么?
What?

386
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,460
我不是红约翰
I'm not red john.

387
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,560
我... 很抱歉让你失望了
I... I'm sorry to disappoint you,

388
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,000
但我只是布雷克组织里
but I'm just a humble foot soldier

389
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,400
普通的一员
in the Blake Association.

390
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,660
红约翰是高层之一
Red John is one of the top brass.

391
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,660
我不确定可以相信你
I'm not sure I believe you.

392
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,730
好吧... 那是你的权利 但...
Well... that's your privilege, but...

393
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,400
但我在告诉你事实
but I am telling you the truth.

394
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,200
你完全得出了错误的结论
You all just jumped to the wrong conclusion.

395
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,830
好吧 那红约翰是谁?
Okay, so who is Red John?

396
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,530
我不知道
Oh, I have no idea.

397
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,730
我... 说的是实话
No, h... honestly.

398
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,960
完全不知道
No idea.

399
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,960
组织遵从必要的时候才会告知情报的原则
The Association works on a strictly need-to-know basis.

400
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,930
假设你说的是实话
Supposing what you say is true,

401
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,030
那我们完全能在电话里把话讲清楚
then we could have had this talk on the phone.

402
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,300
没错 但如果我们在电话里讲清楚了
Yeah, but if we talked on the phone,

403
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,330
那你... 也许就不会来跟我见面了
then you... you probably wouldn't have come to meet me,

404
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,700
对吧?
would you?

405
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,730
有人让我打电话给你
And I was told to call you,

406
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,430
跟你说游戏结束了 然后安排个会面
tell you the game's over, and arrange a meeting.

407
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,030
为什么?
Why?

408
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,360
为什么要我来这儿?
Why am I here?

409
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,700
拜托... 千万别觉得
Please... don't think for a moment

410
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,030
我这么做回很高兴
that I am happy about this.

411
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:53,760
组织可不喜欢有漏洞
The Association doesn't like loose ends.

412
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,860
他们讨厌漏洞
Just hates them.

413
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,530
所以...
So...

414
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,300
动手吧 Oscar
go on, Oscar.

415
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,000
别 听着 听着 我们...
No, no. Listen. Listen. Let's...

416
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,700
我们谈谈 就... 等一下
let's talk about this. Just... w... wait.

417
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,860
真的很抱歉 但我也实在没有办法
Now I am truly sorry, but it is totally out of my hands.

418
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,260
我一直觉得你人不错 Patrick
I always liked you, Patrick.

419
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,130
不 不 没必要这样
No. No. This is not necessary.

420
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,860
咱们别... 别...
We don't... don't...

421
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,330
嘿... 嘿...
H... hey...

422
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,960
多谢了 Oscar
Thank you, Oscar.

423
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,030
你到外边去等着吧...
You can wait outside. Just, uh...

424
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,800
确保没人打扰我们就好
make sure we're left in peace.

425
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,360
你好啊 Patrick
Hello, Patrick.

426
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,700
嗨
Hi.

427
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,400
嘿!
Hey! 

428
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,660
人呢?!
Hello?! 

429
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,100
嘿 现在算怎么回事?
Hey, what's going on?

430
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,460
- Grace 你干什...  - 嘿!
- Grace, what are you...  - Hey!

431
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,560
别... 别这样好不好
What... please don't do that. 

432
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,330
你还不如Cho呢
You're worse than Cho.

433
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,830
他们有义务告诉我们现在怎么回事
They need to tell us what's going on.

434
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,800
他们什么义务也没有
They don't need to do anything.

435
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,000
而且咱们也束手无策 所以请你放轻松
And we can't do anything, so please just relax.

436
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,030
放轻松? 我怎么放轻松?
Relax? How can I relax?

437
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,830
你知道吗 我看你有时候挺享受束手无策的感觉的
You know, sometimes I think you like being helpless.

438
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,430
好吧 我收回 那就别放轻松 行了吧
Okay, fine, I take it back. Don't relax.

439
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,030
那就用你的额头撞碎玻璃
Just break the window with your forehead

440
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,260
咱们一起跳出去 来个百米冲刺
and we'll all jump out and make a run for it. 

441
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,300
咱们别窝里斗 好不好?
Guys, let's try to keep it together, okay?

442
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,530
好 抱歉
Okay, I'm sorry.

443
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,630
"抱歉"
"Sorry."

444
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,930
Mullins 你是这儿的人吧?
Mullins, you're from here, yes?

445
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,300
是的 长官 就在Lincoln Heights那边
Yes, sir. Over to Lincoln Heights.

446
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,260
- 给我一张萨克拉门托的地图  - 是的 长官
- Get me a map of Sacramento.  - Yes, sir.

447
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,460
车上的电脑里有一张
There's one on the computer in the car.

448
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,100
我要纸制的
Paper map.

449
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,200
纸... 制的
Paper... map.

450
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,130
别愣着了 快去找
Come on. Let's go.

451
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,260
嘿 你有纸制地图吗?
Hey, do you have a paper map?

452
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,660
Patrick 终于见面了
Well, Patrick, here we are.

453
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,130
可怜的家伙
Poor fella.

454
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,260
聪明反被聪明误
Smart but dumb.

455
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,360
他根本没想到
It never occurred to him

456
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,000
布雷克组织属于我
that I am the Blake Association.

457
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,760
你为什么非要杀了他?
Why'd you have to kill him?

458
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,800
现在不是人人都觉得他是红约翰吗?
Everyone thinks he's Red John, don't they?

459
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,700
所以... 要是你们俩死在一块
So... it would seem a fitting end to the story

460
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,600
故事才合逻辑
if you two were found dead together.

461
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,460
没人会起疑心
No one will look any deeper.

462
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,130
我就这么死了?
So I'm supposed to die, am I?

463
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,700
都这么多年了
After all these years,

464
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,230
不公平吧
seems kind of unfair.

465
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,630
太公平了
It's totally fair.

466
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,260
游戏结束 我是赢家
The game's over, and I won.

467
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,030
这不是什么游戏
It's not a game.

468
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,700
有赢有输
There's a winner and a loser.

469
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,830
就是游戏
That's a game.

470
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,760
我又没答应要玩这个游戏
It's not a game I asked to play.

471
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,500
是没有 但你依然表现抢眼
No, but you played it very well nonetheless.

472
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,900
你充满着趣味和挑战 谢谢你
You were fun, challenging. Thank you.

473
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,330
你大概有很多问题要问我吧?
You probably have a lot of questions for me, huh?

474
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,400
反正我不赶时间 想问就问吧
We have time, if you want.

475
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,760
我没什么好问的
I have no questions.

476
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,530
你是个邪恶 性变态的反社会者
You're an evil, sexually perverted sociopath

477
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,060
可悲地幻想着成就伟大
with pathetic delusions of grandeur.

478
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,460
其余的不过是些细节
The rest is just details.

479
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,160
"邪恶 性变态的反社会者"?
"Evil, sexually perverted sociopath"?

480
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,930
这些我是得承认 但...
Well, I guess I have to own that, but, uh...

481
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,100
"幻想着成就伟大"?
"delusions of grandeur"?

482
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,830
没有
No.

483
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,230
我从不幻想
I have no delusions.

484
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,030
我建立了一个地下王国
I built a secret empire.

485
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,530
我控制着数千人的生活
I control the lives of thousands of people.

486
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,500
我掌有生杀大权
My word is life and death,

487
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,100
而且我的身份无人得知
and nobody knows who I am.

488
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,760
如果这还不算伟大
Now if that's not grandeur,

489
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,460
我不知道还能叫什么
I don't know what you call it.

490
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,830
我管这叫"一个卑鄙利己主义者的胡言乱语"
I'd call it the ravings of a squalid egomaniac.

491
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,200
瞧见没?
You see?

492
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,360
莫名其妙地 你... 你粗鲁 而且一脸蔑视
For no reason at all, you... you're rude and contemptuous.

493
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,160
这就是为什么你老婆和孩子死了
That's why your wife and kid are dead.

494
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,400
你算什么东西
Who are you to butt in here

495
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,930
在这对我指指点点?
and make obnoxious judgments about me?

496
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,030
你是谁?
Who are you?

497
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,130
嗯?
Hmm?

498
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,660
你是谁?
Who are you?

499
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,030
谁也不是
Nobody.

500
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,260
谁也不是
Nobody.

501
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,360
你过去不知道我
You didn't know me.

502
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,000
你现在仍不知道我
You don't know me.

503
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,460
你什么都不知道
You have no idea.

504
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:28,260
Pat 这就是你的问题
Here's your problem, Pat.

505
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,460
你是个聪明人 但你太骄傲
You're a smart man, but you are arrogant.

506
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,630
你想不出会有人比你聪明
You can't imagine someone smarter than you.

507
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,000
这也是为什么每一次
Which is why I've been ahead of you

508
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,430
我都先你一步
at every step along the way.

509
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:41,030
你手里拿着枪 有什么好吹嘘的?
You're holding the gun. You want to brag?

510
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,460
来吧 我眉头都不会皱一下
Go ahead. I'm not gonna stop you.

511
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,030
你还是不知道我怎么骗过你的吧?
You still don't know how I fooled you, do you?

512
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,360
我如何在那场爆炸幸存?
How did I survive that bomb?

513
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,300
我如何得知你名单上的每一个人?
How did I know all the names on your list?

514
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,230
原来你一直以来是缺乏他人的欣赏吗?
Is this what you've been missing? Appreciation?

515
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,060
嗯?
Hmm?

516
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,900
要不要我鼓个掌?
Do you want me to applaud?

517
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,800
你一头雾水吧?
You have no idea, do you?

518
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,860
我不知道你怎么得知嫌疑人名单的
I don't know how you got the list of suspects.

519
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,900
这个把戏还算有水平
That was a good trick.

520
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,860
但爆炸的事好说
But the bomb gag is simple.

521
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,300
其实有两起爆炸
There were two explosions.

522
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,730
第一枚炸弹仅仅只是把在场所有人震晕
The first was a concussion bomb, knocked everyone out.

523
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:20,360
而在你把我和Bertram拖离危险区之后
The second, lethal bomb that killed Haffner and Stiles

524
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,200
第二枚才爆炸
only went off after you dragged Bertram and me

525
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,960
要了Haffner和Stiles的命
out of harm's way.

526
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,600
正确
Correct.

527
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,430
假死就很容易了
Faking your own death was easy.

528
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,630
Brett Partridge就是布雷克组织的
Brett Partridge was Blake Association.

529
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,630
他的职责能够让其接触到
His job gave him access

530
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,330
DNA的数据库
to the primary DNA database.

531
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,060
他偷换了你和某具尸体的
He switched your DNA records

532
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,860
DNA记录
with a body that you had on ice.

533
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,800
调包
A surrogate.

534
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,460
你把尸体放在后备箱里
And you brought the body to my house

535
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,930
带到我家
in the trunk of your car

536
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,930
然后将其摆在Stiles和Haffner身边
and you put it alongside Stiles and Haffner.

537
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,300
非常对
Very good.

538
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,500
事后你真是个出色的诸葛亮
Your hindsight is 20/20.

539
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,830
能给你看样东西吗?
Can I show you something?

540
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,100
没问题
Sure.

541
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,830
面包屑?
Bread crumbs?

542
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,800
鸟
Birds. 

543
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,130
很聪明
Very clever.

544
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,030
那起爆炸是个错误
The bomb was a mistake.

545
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,800
只是演戏
It was theater.

546
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,860
我知道无论真相看起来如何
I knew that whatever the truth looked like,

547
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,300
相反必是真理
the opposite must be true.

548
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,360
求你了
Please don't.

549
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,600
别杀我
Don't kill me.

550
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,430
你现在想要宽恕了?
Oh, now you want mercy?

551
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,060
在你的所作所为之后?
After all you've done?

552
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,500
你不像我
You're not like me.

553
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,360
你是个好人
You're a good man.

554
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,660
事后你会被困扰的
It'll haunt you.

555
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,960
我才没有犹疑
Oh, I'm not hesitating.

556
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,730
我只是在细细品味此时此刻
I'm just savoring the moment.

557
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,730
你就是红约翰
You're Red John.

558
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,930
我得说我有点小失望
I have to say I'm a little disappointed.

559
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,300
天啊!
Oh, my god!

560
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,800
救命! 他要杀我!
Help! Please! He's gonna kill me!

561
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,660
天啊!
Oh, my god!

562
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,930
我是警察 需要您离开
I'm a policeman, and you need to leave.

563
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,530
先生 无意冒犯 但你看起来不像是警察
Sir, I'm sorry, you don't look like a policeman.

564
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,930
我说是就是 照我说的立刻离开
Yes, I am. Just do as I say and leave right now.

565
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,830
- 请把枪放下  - 你得离开了
- Please put down that gun.  - You need to go.

566
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,260
