00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}that his best one horn friend in the world had abandoned him.

105
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}And worse than that? All that was left on his hand was.

106
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}A hook!

107
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,870
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}This is very fun.

108
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Well I guess it could be worse.

109
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,760
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Who am I kidding? This whole thing was a bad idea.

110
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}It's not a guys' trip with only one guy?

111
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}I mean. it's not like I changed? He's the one who changed.

112
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}He's the one who flakes all the time.  - But he has a family.

113
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You have to be more understanding.

114
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,830
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Yeah.  - Understanding my butt!

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You're better off without that under privileged broken horn plank cancel it.

116
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- But you guys are partners.  - Partners?

117
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,040
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Who cares baby? That deer ain't got nothing on us.

118
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Yeah! You know you're right!

00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You know what would be great to eat just about now?

120
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Another woo-hoo bar. And I know just the place to get it.

121
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,060
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Beautiful.

122
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Now all we need are the balloons and you'll be ready to go!

123

125
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,240
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}I'll never let anything happen to you ever again.

126
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,210
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Hello. ladies!

139
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}No deer on guys' trip.

00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Place where we fit in. A real home.

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,620
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}If only we knew what that was.

146
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Wait a minute.

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Doug. Why do you always let me down?

150

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You could at least pretend to care.

152
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,170
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Oh was I supposed to catch you?

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}I'm telling you Alistair.

156
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,820
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}One of these days I'm gonna give that diva a piece of my mind.

157
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- I'm sure you will.  I mean back where I came from.

00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- I know the zoo.  - No.. No.. No…

159
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- For the last time.  - It's the Wild Animal Park.

160
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}There's a difference you know?

161
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,170
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Anyway. When I was in the Wild Animal Park. No one treated me like that.

162
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}All the animals worshiped me.

163
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}There was one grizzly. One king of the jungle. Me.

164
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Just as soon as we get out of here. We're gonna find a place just like that.

165
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}And I won't forget your help.

166
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}I'll be king. And you'll be.

167
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,520
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Well we'll find something for you to be.

168
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}OK here's the plan. You lift the cart. And we'd both squeezed through.

169
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Go on. Give it a try.  - You want me to pull something?

170
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,040
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Have I ever done you wrong before?

171
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- You promise to take me with you?  - Of course I will.

172
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- You're the Yin to my.  - Yang.

173
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}What? No! What kind of word is Yang?

174
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,810
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}I was thinking more like. You're the 'Yin' to help me get 'Yout'!

175
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,650
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Now let's hurry up before someone sees us.

176
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Come on. What are you waiting for?

177
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}A little help? Please?

178
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,330
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Now you're supervising that's good.

179
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You want something done? You gotta do it yourself.

180
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Too heavy!

181
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Ssshh. Someone will hear you.

182
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Yeah I know. We need another set of arms.

183
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Hey I'm upset too. You can't take this on personal?

184
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}We all have our limitations?

185
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Oh hey!

00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,440
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}That wheel's on your hoof. Doesn't that hurt?

187
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Now where were we?

188
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Oh yeah. We need another set of arms.

00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You don't know how long I've waited for this day.

194
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Yo you got some kind of thing going out of your neck.

198
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}We'll go fishing have rabbit fights. Be best friends!

199
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,960
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Wow. She's here too?  - Hold up. Are you talking about Ursa?

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,750
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}She's difficult to catch.

201
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,430
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- She is like Bear-vana  - Bear-vana?

204
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,220

514
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}With posts stuck in the ground!

515
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- This is a highway!  - Oh

519
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}This still doesn't look like a circus.

520
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,500
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Strange.

521
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}It sure smells like it.

528
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,690
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Maybe it's allergy.  - Wait a minute. Look in the window!

00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}If he was a real friend. He'd understand.

551
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You're absolutely right! Boog is a real friend.

552
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Your life is a mess without him.

553

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Girls. I was just.

00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,720
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Not important. So is it breakfast time again?

00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,920
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Lunch? Dinner? Play time?

00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Is it a dope problem?

561
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,470
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- What's a dope problem?  - Nothing what's up?

562
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,640
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Mom always says that.

563
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You should try and work things out.

564
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You're upset with me?

565
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You're right! I've been a complete failure.

566
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}How can you ever forgive me?

567
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Uh.  We were talking about you and uncle Boog?

568
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You should go talk to him.

569
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,920
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Or maybe we should go and get uncle Boog.

570
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Bring him.  here.

00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Can you help me get my wife unstacked from the pine?

578
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Can you help me with my nuts?

579
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Thought we were gonna mark the perimeter?

580
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Hold on!  - What about our habitat?

581
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Yeah!  - Hey Boog can you help me with thing?

583
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Do you think dad and uncle Boog will ever forgive each other?

584
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}What's going to happen if they don't?

585
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,710
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Enough! Enough!

586
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,340
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}I'm not your servant!

587
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,380
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}I'm king of the jungle!

588
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Well technically the lion is the king of the jungle.

589
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,400
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}And this is the forest.

590
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,730
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}A jungle tends to be denser and hotter.

591
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Deer!  - What? I travel.

593
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,410
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Either way. Things are gonna change around here.

594
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,570
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You! Go get me some nice ripped berries.

595
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,450
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}And you two. Find me a good waterfall where I can have a nice soak.

596
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- And you Doily!  - Riley!

597
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Whatever!

598
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You and your guys go build me a nice comfortable bed. Up on that hill.

599
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Don't you mean in your cave?  - Oh yeah.

600
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}My cave.

601
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Move!  - Better do what he says.

602
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}He's gone bluhnicaccasl

603
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,550
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}He has really lost it.

604
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Yeah.  - Could be stress. Big mad bear disease.

605
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:29,020
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- It could be stupid deer disease.  - Seriously? Is that going around?

606
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Maybe we've all been taking him for granted a little too much.

607
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,130
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Oh! Hello girls.

608
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,790
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}How long have you two been standing there?

609
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,420
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}We just uh. Got here?

611
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:00,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Oh uh. Nervous? Who's nervous?

612
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}What do you girls want?

613
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,390
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}We just wanted to say.

614
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}How glad we are that you're back. Bye!

615
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Hey. _ Perhaps Boog is uh.  changing huh?  - That's not it.

616
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,490
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}We change all the time huh?

630
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,360
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}I see a little drop of moisture on your upper brow.

631

635
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,800
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}There is something different about Doug.

636
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:16,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Looks like someone got a hair brush for birthday.

637
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,180
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Still think I'm Doug?  -Yes.

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- What are you trying to prove Doug?  - That I'm Boog!

640
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,890
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Let's try the ladder.  - Oh forget it.

641
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:41,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}-Well can you ride.   - Unicycle?

642
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,740
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Check this out.

643
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,500

644
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,080

645
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,670
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}But once you get to know me. The real me.

646
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}-You might like me.  - Leave me alone!

647
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Doug was afraid of heights.

648
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,900
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}If you're really Boog. Why don't you come up here and prove it?

649
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Don't give up. Follow her. She wants you to.

650
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,600
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}That's.  pretty high.

651
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,660
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You're probably right.

652
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,780
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}That impressed a pretty girl.

653
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,070
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Hm.  -Just go!

654
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:33,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}One can't help but be moved no?

655
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Wow. Now you believe me?

656
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}I believed you when you ride the unicycle.

657
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,140
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Doug couldn't do that either.

658
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,810
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You mean you made me climb all the way up here for nothing?

659
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:57,980
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Not for nothing.

660
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You need to be punished for juggling the dog.

661
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Boog. What a nice name.

662
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:20,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}If you want to practice the dance.

663
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:22,680
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Meet me outside.

664
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,090
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You put a girl in grizzly!

665
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:33,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Cats tonight you're gonna play your little whiskers off.

666
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}And a one and a two. Miaw miaw miaw miaw…

667
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:51,000
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- You dance very well Boog.  - I practiced.

668
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,200
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}I figured you might trip me or something if I messed up.

669
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Me? I would never do that.

670
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,630
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Yeah but I might. So you'd better watch yourself.

671
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:08,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Oh definitely looking good.

672
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You are not like other bears.

673
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,480
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Why is this?  - I don't know.

674
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Maybe it's because I grew up with humans.

675
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:20,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Really? Me too! I grew up in circus!  - Me too!

676
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,520
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Well.  Kinda.

677
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,280
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}I mean I used to do this show back in Timber Line.

678
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:27,910
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}It wasn't a whole circus. But I juggled and stuff.

679
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,700
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}You and me we are not like other grizzlies.

680
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:35,160
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}We are not like. Anybody else in the world!

681
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,260
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Ooh that was so inspiring.

682
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,270
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}So moving.

683

{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}So.  so prof undo.

684
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,570
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Let us retire to the caravan. For our end of the day talk.

685
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:09,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- We should practice the lift.  - I'd like that.

686
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:14,950
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Come. We will hook. Over to the trailer.

687
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Time to share.

688
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,290
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Like the amigos we are!I pulled something.

689
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}If just once I could perform the dance. The way it was meant to be.

690
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:30,590
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}I would never need to perform it again.

691
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:35,970
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Boogie! What about the guys chat?

692
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,310
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Huh? Yeah. Ursa and I need to practice.

693
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:23,190
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Doily! Make sure you get that spot right by my third

694
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:26,520
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Ooh! Yeah! That's it!

695
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:31,610
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Sorry Boogster. Just a little cramp at my neck.

696
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,990
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Seriously? Six pack take some pride in your work!

697
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,530
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Any chance we can take a little break?

698
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:41,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}A break? You all just had a break. Like. _ six hours ago.

699
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:45,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- What is going on here?  - Giselle! Thank goodness! You're back!

701
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Excellent! Re-enforcements. You two! Go get me some more berries.

702
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,050
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}And you! How about you start massaging my paws?

703
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,220
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}All this clapping is making me sore.

704
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,100
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Now!

705
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:04,560
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Who are you?  - What are you talking about?

706
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,940
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Boog would never yell like that. Especially at fawns.

707
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:10,230
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- So who are you?  - Who am I?

708
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,150
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- If you haven't noticed I'm.  -Boog!

709
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:16,320
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}I'm so sorry I let you down.

710
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,860
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Can you ever forgive me?  - Does that answer your question?

711
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:26,250
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Giselle! Oh thank goodness you're back.

712
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,540
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}See? Even the crazy broken deer knows I'm Boog.

713
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,080
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Do you even know his name?  - Of course I do.

714
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:36,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- It's…Uh…  - Starts with an E.

715
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}E …. Emily?

716
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,930
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}- Edward?  - What about 2 L's?

717
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,770
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}Eleanor? Oh whatever. It doesn't matter what his name is.

718
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:49,350
{\fnCambria\bord1\shad1\1c&H55E3F0&\i1\be1}All that matters. Is that I'm a grizzly. And I'm king of the jungle.
