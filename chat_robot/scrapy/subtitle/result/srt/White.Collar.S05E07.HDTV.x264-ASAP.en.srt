1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,850
<i>Previously on White Collar...</i>

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,330
The Mosconi Codex.

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,040
This is no ordinary book.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,770
I think Hagen is using you.

5
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,160
The only chance we have
of getting a leg up on him

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,020
is by deciphering the codex first.

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,100
- Neal took off,didn't he?
- Yeah,he sure did.

8
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,660
Find out where he went.

9
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,650
Surveillance cameras a block from
the vodka room led us to a cabbie.

10
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,630
Is there any reason he'd
slip away to come here?

11
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,230
Neal always has a reason.

12
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,210
You okay?

13
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,310
I can't exhale until I hear you
walk through that door at night.

14
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,760
Agent Siegel's murder was
a random act of violence.

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,380
But it's not gonna
happen to me.I promise.

16
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,430
But the codex has been hidden
away its entire existence.

17
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,720
How did you get a copy?

18
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,110
Our copy of the codex is incomplete.

19
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,570
How much do you have?

20
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,820
A single chapter.

21
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,340
It's chapter 13.

22
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,630
In all the books he ever produced,

23
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,720
he never wrote a chapter 13.

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,660
Haircut,new suit.

25
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,720
What's the occasion?

26
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,750
On this very day,I walked
into a downtown art gallery

27
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,920
and first laid eyes on my future wife.

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,610
Ah,routine art crime investigation

29
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,600
turns into the luckiest
day of your life.

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,660
I agree.

31
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,760
And to celebrate,we're
going to the same restaurant

32
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,780
- we went to on our first date.
- Papaya King?

33
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,900
La Cucina de Tua Nonna.

34
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,510
Red sauce,wine in straw bottles.

35
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,200
Napkin tucked into your collar?

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,950
I'm making it a point to
remember all the anniversaries.

37
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,810
Birthdays,weddings,the day we brought
Satchmo home from the breeders.

38
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,300
I imagined a stork delivery.

39
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,740
- December 7th.
- Pearl Harbor day?

40
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,720
Another day that will live in infamy.

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,730
First time I arrested you.

42
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,400
- Hmm,and four years later we did it all over again.
- Yeah.

43
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,300
But this time,you gave me jewelry.

44
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,900
Which is why I asked
you to meet me here.

45
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,690
I removed your anklet

46
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,720
for our undercover
operation at the vodka room.

47
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,870
Soon after,I found this.

48
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,460
Don't we have hundreds of
those back at the office?

49
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,210
I have a hunch this has
special significance.

50
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,050
Office building,56th Street.

51
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,960
Gravich Chiropractic.

52
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,210
Our next case.

53
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,400
Could be mine.

54
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,730
I'm here to help.

55
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,510
You can go home now.

56
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,090
This year,skip the straw bottle wine.

57
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,430
Spring for some sangiovese.

58
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,800
I'll order what I always order.

59
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,500
I downloaded it to my phone
so I'd always have it with me.

60
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,230
I still love Italian.

61
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,730
I still love you.

62
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,360
So am I the first guy
you ever made a sign for?

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,840
It was the first sign
that didn't say "Go away."

64
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,610
Oh,it wouldn't have discouraged me.

65
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,970
Did you ever think where you would be

66
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,200
if you didn't walk into
my gallery that day?

67
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,590
Nope. Never.

68
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,380
Too scary to think about.

69
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,290
How's work going? Getting any better?

70
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,860
Yeah,we added Siegel's
picture to the honor wall.

71
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,170
That was something,at least.

72
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,590
Hey,what kind of celebration is this?

73
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,110
- Glasses are almost empty.
- Thank you.

74
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,310
Scusi.

75
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,190
We didn't order these.

76
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,730
What's wrong? Do you know her?

77
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,040
I think I do.

78
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,420
That's Jill.

79
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,790
Jill.

80
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,700
From Quantico.

81
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,520
Oh,that's Jill?

82
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,320
Right. My ex-girlfriend.

83
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,520
- Peter.
- Yes.

84
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,450
It's been a long time.

85
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,370
20 years long.

86
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,410
I never thought I'd
see you here,tonight.

87
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,840
I hunted you down.

88
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,910
This is my wife,Elizabeth.

89
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,550
It's great to meet you.

90
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,330
Uh,wait,I've interrupted something.

91
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,070
Oh,no.This is just an average
Tuesday night for us,right?

92
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,630
Come on,sit down. Join us.

93
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,330
- Okay.
- Okay.Okay.

94
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,740
So,um,what are you doing in New York?

95
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,080
I'm on a case. Thought I'd look you up.

96
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,710
How'd you find me?

97
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,560
That's what I do,Peter.

98
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,630
You still in SSG?

99
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,590
Last time I checked in.

100
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,340
What's SSG?

101
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,510
SSG: Special surveillance group.

102
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,950
We track down the bad guys,follow 'em,

103
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,670
record 'em if we can.

104
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,830
Sounds fascinating.

105
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,010
- You still drink bourbon?
- On occasion.

106
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,790
Well,this is a damn
special one.How about you?

107
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,350
Sure,why not?

108
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,310
Remember our toast?

109
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,660
Truth,justice...

110
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,860
And stay out of our way.

Here it is.

115
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,590
Every time I pass this house I was
tempted to knock and ask for a look inside.

116
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,730
Oh,you should have.

117
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,760
My landlady would have
invited you in for coffee.

118
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,180
God,it's like a good book
I'm finally getting to read.

119
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,710
I can't believe you live here.

120
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,720
Well,I just rent the epilogue.

121
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,370
Can I get you a glass of wine?

122
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,770
FBI agents are allowed
to drink on the job?

123
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,430
Well,we're always on the
job.What choice do we have?

124
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,570
And now that you're joining
us,I'm gonna corrupt you too.

125
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,610
Thank you.

126
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,200
So where's this phantom
chapter 13 of yours?

127
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,820
Right here.

128
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,740
- It can't be.
- Why? What's wrong?

129
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,000
What's wrong is that it's right.

130
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,260
It's--it--it's a Mosconi,but
that's impossible.

131
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,810
That would make it the only
chapter 13 that he ever made.

132
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,380
Well,it was copied directly from
the codex at the Gershon Museum.

133
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,630
It is his handwriting.

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,930
This is crazy.

135
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,280
And this.

136
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,810
Here.

137
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,310
It's a study for a painting.

138
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,660
That he didn't put on canvas until
a year after this was published.

139
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,030
So these pages,they couldn't
have been done by anyone else.

140
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,610
And this has to be from
his New York period.

141
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,800
1886.He was here less than a year.

142
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,780
FBI art crimes database.

143
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,250
Maybe he wrote his only
chapter 13 in New York as well.

144
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,320
Well,Mosconi rushed
back to Italy in a hurry.

145
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,090
The why he ran is a mystery.

146
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,240
And the book he left us is
more of a what than a why.

147
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,510
He was a puzzling man who loved puzzles.

148
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,020
See,Mosconi believed that
if someone wanted the truth,

149
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,740
they should have to search for it.

150
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,120
What--what
are you doing?

151
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,800
If this book is a puzzle,maybe
these are the pieces.

152
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,060
Look at that.

153
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,000
Come here.

154
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,510
Oh,my gosh.

155
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,630
Here's one.

156
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,800
Where's the middle?

157
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,300
It's gotta be here somewhere.

158
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,210
- It's incredible.
- It looks like a stained glass window.

159
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,900
But if he wrote chapter
13 when he was in New York,

160
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,810
this stained glass window could
be right here in Manhattan.

161
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,470
Do you--do you realize
what you've just done?

162
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,660
Made a mess of the codex?

163
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,560
No,I-I think you might have just made

164
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,500
one of the most important
discoveries on Mosconi in decades.

165
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,260
Ah,working into the night?Impressive.

166
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,350
You should know the
FBI frowns on overtime.

167
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:20,220
- Uh,we--we've made
incredible progress,sir.- Yes.

168
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,460
- I'm gonna let Agent Caffrey fill you in.
- Sure.

169
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,010
You know,I'm
gonna...research this window.

170
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,380
See if I can find out where it is.

171
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,440
Yeah,I'll put my FBI
resources on it as well.

172
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,720
- We can see who finds it first.
- 'Kay.

173
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,430
What?

174
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,650
You,business,and
women...the unholy trinity.

175
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,380
Rebecca is all about the
business of the codex.

176
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,740
Oh,like I've never seen this before.

177
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,380
Kate,Alex,Sarah.Now Rebecca.

178
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,370
There's more behind this than the codex.

179
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,570
So you're an expert on romance now?

180
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,410
One who has loved not
wisely,but too well.

181
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,890
- Othello.
- Yeah. We all know how that turned out.

182
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,590
You okay?

183
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,570
Pretty quiet on the way home.

184
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,280
Well,I didn't wanna break the spell.

185
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,130
Oh,look,honey.

186
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,720
Jill challenged me.

187
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,880
You ow that I didn't enter
Quantico all that sure of myself.

188
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,030
But she tried so hard to beat me

189
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,140
that I worked my butt off to beat her.

190
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,590
- And...
- Look at you now.

191
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,780
No,that's not what I meant.

192
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,330
It's...it's just that I never thought

193
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,790
that I could finish as high as I did.

194
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,660
You know that.

195
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,410
You're the reason I'm
the man I am today.

196
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,980
Continue.

197
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,600
I couldn't have gotten through
this past year without you.

198
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,550
Or...any year.

199
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,600
You know,it's still our anniversary.

200
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,970
I was hoping you'd say that.

201
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,260
Thank you,detective.

202
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,030
Right,well,let's hope it does.

203
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,820
Bye. We'll take it from here.

204
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,190
That was NYPD.

205
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,050
Two days ago someone in Brooklyn
commandeered a vehicle posing as an FBI agent.

206
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,620
- Yesterday he struck again.
- Did he flash a badge?

207
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,230
NYPD doesn't know if it's real or not.

208
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,850
Or if it could be Siegel's.

209
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,230
Chances are slight that it
is,but we need to check it out.

210
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,580
Could be our first
solid lead in two weeks.

211
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,930
I want you and Jones on
this.Two people I trust.

212
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,300
Well,1 1/2.

213
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,000
Who is that?

214
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Uh,no one important.

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,980
Come up with something
to catch this guy.Now go.

216
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,670
- You seem nervous.
- Just leave,just leave.

217
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,500
- Hey.
- Neal Caffrey.

218
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,960
Do we know each other?

219
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,190
Jill stone. I stayed up all night
reading the case files of you two.

220
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,380
Couldn't put it down.

221
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,780
The good ones keep you up at night.

222
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,690
Mm-hmm. The bad ones even longer.

223
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,990
He was just leaving.

224
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,710
- I wasn't expecting you.
- We're a secretive bunch.

225
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,240
Tell me we're looking at the same thing.

226
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,130
Peter Burke uncomfortable.

227
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,200
That's not his natural state.

228
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,570
You know she's FBI?

229
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,160
Well,it's not your run of the mill suit.

230
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,870
Not that she ever wears one.

231
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,480
Look at the way she holds herself.Open.

232
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,320
Totally exposed.

233
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,520
Confidence and plenty of it.

234
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,660
Ooh. Oh,that's not the first
time she's touched him like that.

235
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,060
They have a past.

236
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,140
Look at her eyes. All over his face.

237
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,040
Yeah,she wants to see if
he still feels anything.

238
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,860
- Whoa what?
- They slept together.

239
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,730
- Peter?
- Not recently.

240
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,600
All right,you know I heard he
had a pretty serious relationship

241
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,060
with a female agent down at Quantico.

242
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,200
She joined SSG.

243
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,720
The CIA of the FBI?

244
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,490
Those are some badass agents.

245
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,770
That explains the confidence.

246
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,210
That's Peter's ex.It has to be.

247
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,600
I couldn't talk about the
case in front of your wife.

248
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,160
White Collar related?

249
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,420
I'm tracking a tech genius
named Mason Sadowski.

250
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,030
Doesn't look all that intimidating.

251
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,120
In today's world that's
what trouble looks like.

252
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,560
He's part of a team that invented a
new and extremely dangerous microchip

253
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,490
for one of our top defense contractors.

254
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,470
- Then he decided he didn't wanna share?
- Exactly.

255
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,190
Must be a very important chip.

256
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,760
Something to do with decoding passwords.

257
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,180
With it,a two-bit hacker
could break through

258
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,170
our most sophisticated security walls.

259
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,790
Low-hanging fruit for our enemies.

260
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,590
Yeah,he put it on the black market.

261
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,900
I've established a cover
I.D. as a broker for Iran.

262
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,240
Set the hook yet?

263
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,670
- He swallowed it.
- Good.

264
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,380
Waiting for a buy time to reel him in.

265
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,740
My problem: Most buyers representing
foreign interests come in twos.

266
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,420
In order for the ruse
to work,I need a partner.

267
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,700
Someone with undercover experience.

268
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,650
Someone you can trust.

269
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,260
More than any other agent in New York.

270
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,480
- Section Chief Bruce Hawes put the order through personally.
- Oh,Bruce,huh?

271
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,380
Not only Bruce.Your name gets
dropped a lot in Washington.

272
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,880
Nice to hear.

273
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,700
You know New York,and I don't have GPS.

274
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,770
Besides,you're the best.
Next to me,of course.

275
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,080
Oh,that was Quantico. This is now.

276
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,120
I'll set up the buy.

277
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,420
This is gonna be fun.

278
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,250
- Got that too.
- Here.

279
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,300
- Good to see you.
- Take care.

280
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,740
Bye.

281
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,090
She left Peter with
a lot to think about.

282
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,770
Get back to work!

283
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,040
And still uncomfortable.

284
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,480
- Oh,hey,you got plans later?
- Why?

285
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,820
ASAC gave us an assignment.

286
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,630
NYPD informed Peter someone may be
using Siegel's badge in Brooklyn.

287
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,970
All right,I'll coordinate with NYPD.

288
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,750
We'll need the perp's
description and his M.O.

289
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,450
So we know what we're looking for.

290
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,390
Or we help him find us.

291
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,170
Jill's just an FBI agent
who needs help on a case.

292
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,350
That's it. End of story.

293
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,890
You never look at Jones like that.

294
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,810
- Drop it.
- Hold on a second.

295
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,570
Does El know that your
old ex is your new partner?

296
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,970
I'm gonna tell her tonight
when it's more relaxed.

297
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,260
All right,at least give up the details.

298
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,340
- What broke you two lovers up?
- I don't know.

299
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,120
She went west,I went east.It
doesn't matter anymore.

300
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,520
- It always matters.
- No,what matters

301
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,740
is that you catch the
guy flashing the badge.

302
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,330
All right,Jones and I are gonna cruise
Brooklyn tonight in sheep's clothing,but...

303
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,550
But what?

304
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,440
The wolves need a sleeker wardrobe.

305
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,390
Yes.

306
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,460
Drop me off.

307
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,650
Dinner's almost ready.

308
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,110
- Jill came to my office today.
- I figured she would.

309
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,590
Why don't you pour me a glass
of wine and tell me all about it?

310
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,560
What kind of wine is this?

311
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,590
Oh,that's the bottle Mozzie gave us
last Christmas you were afraid to open.

312
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,050
Still am.

313
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,990
- You expecting someone?
- No.

314
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,040
Oh...hi,Elizabeth.

315
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,920
Um,wow,it smells like Italy in here.

316
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,240
I forgot people still make dinner.

317
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,090
I forgot people just drop by.

318
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,140
I'm so sorry I keep interrupting you.

319
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,270
I should have called first,but
we're just kind of in a rush.

320
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,880
- "We"?
- Oh,Peter.I found where the guy's holed up,

321
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,390
so we gotta do recon on
the thing now,right now.

322
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,010
You guys workin' on a case together?

323
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,190
That's why Jill is in New York and
since it was White Collar related...

324
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,170
- What's it about?
- Mm,it's classified.

325
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,950
Oh,well,nothing we discuss
ever leaves this house.

326
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,980
I'm sorry,hon.We can't discuss this one.

327
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,040
- You okay?
- Why wouldn't I be?

328
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,240
I'll call you on my way home.

329
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,810
- I'll try to get him home in one piece.
- Yeah.

330
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,430
Do you live in this?

331
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,920
When I have to.

332
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,300
All you're missing is a
fridge and a hot plate.

333
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,120
- Well,I'm thinking about putting in a fireplace and jacuzzi.
- That'd be nice.

334
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,320
How come you're still in the field?

335
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,420
I mean,you had big
ambitions way back then.

336
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,420
I expected you to be
assistant director by now.

337
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,560
I'm on a Washington track.For the
time being,I'm serving double duty.

338
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,890
ASAC and Neal's handler.

339
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,440
I'm pretty happy doing both.

340
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,580
- Peter...
- What?

341
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,200
You don't have to put
up a strong front for me.

342
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,890
You were the supervisor
of an agent who got killed.

343
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,740
I know you're hurting.

344
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,350
- The entire bureau is.
- Yeah.

345
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,030
It's been hard to shake it.

346
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,410
I lost my partner eight years ago.

347
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,310
Still can't.

348
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,260
Cruisin' for the bad guy in a sweet
ride,just like Crockett and Tubbs.

349
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,290
I am living the dream.

350
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,470
Did you base your entire
future on Miami Vice?

351
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,740
Ah,Hill Street Blues,Cagney & Lacey...

352
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,730
- any show about law enforcement.
- I had a different perspective.

353
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,480
Let me guess,rooting for the bad guys?

354
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,540
Only when they were good,Cagney.

355
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,620
We've been driving around for
about three hours.Where is this guy?

356
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,070
We were chasing a couple
that robbed a bank in Pomona.

357
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,230
They split up. I followed the guy.

358
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,140
Earl was following the girl.
She pretended to surrender.

359
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,700
She shot him.

360
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,440
Is that why you work alone?

361
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,770
It wasn't my fault,but it
still feels like it was.

362
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,380
Siegel used to come to my office

363
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,620
and just wanna hear about my old cases.

364
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,110
He couldn't get enough.

365
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,030
I brought him here from Chicago.

366
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,750
David was my responsibility.

367
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,540
- Can't protect everybody.
- No.

368
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,520
And you can't take their place.

369
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,080
Even though sometimes
you wish you could.

370
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,010
- Any closer to finding the killer?
- Not yet.

371
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:27,710
Today we got a potential lead.

372
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,430
You'll find him.

373
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:33,260
Justice is not always as
swift as we want it to be.

374
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,200
Isn't that our guy?

375
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,940
Yeah,he's out of his
room. Now's our chance.

376
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,780
- What?
- I don't know.Bad feeling.

377
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,240
I hope we don't get jacked
before our perp shows up.

378
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,280
Hold on a second.

379
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,330
Whoa,what are you doing?You know Peter
doesn't like folks touching his buttons.

380
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,600
Trying to get a better view.

381
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,300
Looks like your hope
is about to come true.

382
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,690
- On your left.
- Yeah?

383
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,260
- I need your car.Official FBI business.
- Yep.

384
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,950
Get out now! Criminal's getting away.

385
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,790
- Be cool,man!
- How are we gonna get our car back?

386
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,950
Real FBI.

387
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,850
Hands on the roof.

388
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,860
What do you got?

389
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,380
***

390
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,760
I would have had you if I wore flats.

391
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,720
Well,I never knew you
to make excuses before.

392
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,370
Okay,you won that one.

393
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,010
- Savor it,because it'll be your last.
- Okay.

394
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,050
Thanks for letting us
in. Honeymooners,right?

395
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,830
- Always forgetting something.
- Si,senor.

396
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,690
Come on,let's find a place to stash the gun
in case we get patted down before the buy.

397
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,030
You think he took the chip with him?

398
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,840
If I thought so,I would
have taken him outside.

399
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,170
Then maybe he left it here.

400
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,330
Give me the gun.

401
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,540
You could have had any assignment
you wanted when we left Quantico.

402
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,720
Why Los Angeles?

403
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,030
- Hey,that looks familiar.
- Yeah.

404
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,720
Same guys we passed on our way in.

405
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,690
They might be competitive
shoppers for our chip.

406
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,730
Let's find out who they are.

407
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,500
Take a selfie like
we're a couple on a date.

408
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,180
Come on,closer.We gotta sell it.

409
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,550
Neal,you got him?

410
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,060
You left him bleeding on the
sidewalk.A bullet in his chest.

411
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,670
- An FBI agent.
- One of us.

412
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,530
I didn't kill the dude.

413
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,920
I pulled that badge and
gun outta the trash.I swear.

414
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:37,290
You know,when a murderer swears,

415
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,310
I tend not to believe them.

416
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,750
It was a Friday.

417
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,530
About a month ago. When
people cash their g-checks.

418
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,310
Oh,yeah?What time of day was it?

419
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,630
Later. Almost dark.

420
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,060
Where were you before that?
Between 3:00 and 4:00 P.M.?

421
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,290
I-I don't remember.

422
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,430
"I don't remember". Well,you know what?

423
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,040
It doesn't matter because you've
got the badge and you've got the gun.

424
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,590
And your prints are all over them.

425
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,570
You're going down for this.

426
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,860
- Let's go.My skin is starting to crawl.
- No,wait,wait.

427
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:11,170
When your guy got hit,I
was inside Dante's Liquor.

428
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,610
- For an hour?
- Waited till it emptied out so I could rob it.

429
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,270
The place was crowded and
full of cash on check day.

430
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,650
Look,check it out.The store's
got cameras. They don't lie.

431
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,870
Get in there with him.

432
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,240
- Head down to the liquor store.I wanna see that footage.
- Yeah.

433
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,560
Look,you got him to talk.

434
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Peter.

435
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,130
You did everything you could.

436
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,040
- Are you okay?
- You're awake?

437
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,100
I always wait up for you.

438
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,830
Well,sometimes you fall asleep.

439
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,210
Not this time.

440
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,670
Tell me all about it.

441
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,500
It's classified.

442
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,450
Oh,come on.

443
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,450
It's not like Jill will ever find out.

444
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,390
I can't.

445
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,610
We always discuss your cases.

446
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,120
I know,but I--and I can't wait
to tell you about it.But...

447
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,010
not until it's done.

448
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,680
What's so special about this one?

449
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,060
I'm sorry,it's...
- Classified.

450
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,970
You understand,right?

451
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,580
Of course I do.

452
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,640
I'm an FBI wife.

453
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:38,960
Facial recognition scan pegged
them as Eric Healey and Robert Bly.

454
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,290
They're both ex-black ops.

455
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,180
They've been freelancing for some of
our lesser known defense contractors.

456
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,460
They're high-end mercenaries.

457
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:52,460
Yeah,it does look like we're not
the only ones hunting our genius.

458
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:55,720
Rival defense contractors would
do anything for that technology.

459
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,850
I think these guys are
looking to be the new sellers.

460
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,310
Which means they're not gonna buy it.

461
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,610
They're gonna steal it.

462
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,670
Hey,Elizabeth Burke.

463
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,970
Bearing gifts in a brown
paper bag.I can only imagine.

464
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,340
Oh,it's just his lunch.

465
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,520
He forgot it this morning.

466
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,410
Why aren't you in there?

467
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,860
Uh,scratched off the need to know list.

468
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,590
Yeah,me too.

469
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,860
Come on,let's go in.

470
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,560
No,Neal,I'm not that kind of wife.

471
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,240
Well,I'm definitely that kind of C.I.

472
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,160
No,I'll just leave it on his desk.

473
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,380
All right.

474
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,490
What do we think of this Jill?

475
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,670
There's need for further study.

476
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,110
I think she's lonely.

477
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,430
Well,she lives out of an '86 Chevy.I
doubt she throws a lot of dinner parties.

478
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,710
She never got married.

479
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,560
Peter could be the
last man she ever loved.

480
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,460
20 years is a long time to go
without loving someone else.

481
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,970
You fall in love with
Peter,you--you are in love.

482
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,400
I can't imagine those
feelings ever going away.

483
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,970
- Not completely.
- Really?

484
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,030
Peter Burke?The man
in the conference room?

485
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,860
You have no idea.

486
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:02,760
This is good.

487
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,040
We'll have Jones coordinate with NYPD.

488
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,360
We'll get a current location of the SUV.

489
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:10,130
- He can trail it and give us updates of its whereabouts.
- No.

490
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,440
Peter.I think I was pretty clear.

491
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,800
No one else can know anything.No
one else can be involved.

492
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,220
It's my case,my rules.

493
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,430
It's our case.

494
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,070
I brought you in on this.Don't
make me take you off.

495
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,350
You brought it to White
Collar,and I'm ASAC here.

496
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,120
We'll do it our way or you're out.

497
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,400
You're not serious.

498
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,630
This face doesn't look serious to you?

499
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,370
Okay...ASAC.

500
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,110
Jones keeps tabs,he reports back
to us,but we don't tell him why.

501
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,500
Agreed.

502
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,250
Yeah.

503
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,180
- I'm gonna say hi to El.
- Yep.

504
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,500
- Did you call her?
- I did.

505
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,800
El couldn't have been sweeter.

506
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,730
- That's good,right?
- It's terrible.

507
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:42,720
When she's upset with me,she makes
herself irresistible and unavailable.

508
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,710
- Oh,nice technique.
- Drives me crazy.

509
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,460
- All right,go home,talk to her in person.
- I can't.

510
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,600
Jill's setting something up.

511
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,600
If I have to leave El
mid-apology to meet Jill...

512
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,390
So just assign a different
agent to work with Jill.

513
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,360
This case is too important.

514
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,530
- Besides,she doesn't trust anyone else.
- Okay.

515
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,920
Is it about the case
or is it about Jill?

516
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,440
I can talk to Jill about losing David.

517
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,650
She's been through it herself.

518
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:16,710
And you don't wanna worry El
any more than she already is.

519
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,190
I don't.She's been
through enough this year.

520
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,050
Enough to believe that other
bad things are possible.

521
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,190
El knows that I'm in love with her.

522
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,060
- She trusts me.
- Trust?

523
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,820
Now you see it,now you don't.

524
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,580
I have to go.

525
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,320
Thing I can't talk about?

526
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,780
It's going down.

527
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,670
- You must follow him.
- Look,I am not following him.

528
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,840
I'm not following my husband.

529
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,780
He's never given me
reason not to trust him.

530
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,400
- Until now.
- Mozzie.

531
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,790
You can trust truffles
harvested in the Perigord region,

532
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:52,560
bed linens handwoven in Madeira,and,for
the most part,a Teddy bear named Mozart.

533
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,340
But people?Almost never.

534
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,400
You trust Neal.

535
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,880
Neal is the reason "never"
was preceded by "almost.

536
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,260
"""I'm not following Peter."

537
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,490
- You must.
- I won't.

538
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,870
- You must.
- No.

539
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,120
Then follow the woman.

540
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,320
Or does your intrepid faith in
the Suit extend to her as well?

541
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,090
- What do you have?
- Yeah,Peter.

542
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,290
I followed the SUV to the village.

543
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,940
They just parked and
went into a restaurant.

544
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,340
- Thanks,Jones.Let me know when they leave.
- Okay.

545
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:28,160
Mercenaries just went into a restaurant.

546
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,690
That meal should keep 'em on
the shelf until we make the buy.

547
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,120
Well,they're after the
chip.Why stop for a meal?

548
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,620
They don't know our
buy's going down now.

549
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,660
Even bad guys gotta eat.

550
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,620
You and the missus okay?She left
the office in kind of a hurry.

551
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,340
Yeah,she was just
dropping by a sandwich.

552
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,280
Sweet.I depend on the
kindness of delivery guys.

553
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,100
You never got married?

554
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,970
Who would put up with me?

555
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,200
- Yeah?
- Yeah,Peter.

556
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,020
I've got a bad feeling about this.

557
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,230
We don't have eyes on the rear.

558
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,430
Requesting permission
for a walk-through.

559
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,240
Can't he just do a simple walk-through?

560
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,620
It's not part of the
agreement.You tell him to stand by.

561
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,750
Don't go.

562
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,730
She doesn't want me to go.You do.

563
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,520
- Right.
- Gotcha.

564
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,510
- I'm going in.
- Got it.

565
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,380
- Mozzie was supposed to help me,but...
- Bunion removal.

566
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,830
- I heard all about it.
- Okay.

567
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,060
This is where I think she's staying.

568
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:32,860
I want you to come with me.

569
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,010
I hear she stays at the '86 Caprice.

570
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,500
I saw a picture of them
in front of this hotel.

571
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,000
Close.Extremely close.

572
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,040
And she looked smitten,but he
looked like he wanted to go home.

573
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,430
Because he's in love with you.

574
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,980
I know that.What I don't know
is her intentions with him.

575
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,350
I mean,he's not an ordinary
man,but he is a man.

576
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:51,350
If they are there,it's for the
case and that could be dangerous.

577
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,740
That's why I need you.

578
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,840
If you don't go with
me,I'm gonna go alone.

579
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,080
Wait.

580
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,610
I'll drive.You're too angry.

581
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,530
I'm tired of sitting.Let's go.

582
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,490
We're early.

583
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,980
We'll catch him off guard.

584
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
Or tip him off.

585
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,730
I've done this before,Peter.

586
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,900
Look,they're probably not even here.

587
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,180
Okay,they're here.

588
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,170
That is not what it looked like.

589
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,550
It better not be.

590
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,270
You know...

591
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,250
I really thought I was
gonna see both of them

592
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,470
sitting on stools so close to
each other they were touching.

593
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,790
You know,Peter having a
beer and Jill having whatever

594
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,070
women have when they're sitting
with someone else's husband.

595
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,340
All right,don't jump to conclusions.

596
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,710
Too late.Already jumped.

597
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,320
Wait at the bar.

598
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,700
I'll pull a room number
out of the desk clerk.

599
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,260
If...there is a room number.

600
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,480
Mercenaries are gone.

601
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,860
They must have I.D.'d us and snuck
out the back of the restaurant.

602
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,680
I want you to put the tac team
on alert.I'm calling Peter.

603
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,740
SSG procedure.Radio silence.

604
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,000
Okay,start tracking
Peter's cell phone now.

605
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,010
He might be walking into an ambush.

606
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,160
- Elizabeth.
- Neal.

607
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,420
A man from Peter's file is in the bar.

608
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:57,480
That's why they're here.It was the case.

609
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,870
I told you not to jump.

610
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,070
I'm sure Peter's looking for him.

611
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,940
I think I could stall him.

612
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,210
Call Peter for me,okay?

613
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,320
Elizabeth,don't
do anything--

614
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,830
Um,are you staying at the hotel?

615
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,740
Yeah,uh,I'm staying.You?

616
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,300
No.Just getting a drink.

617
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,850
Are you in a rush?

618
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,410
- What?
- Well,sit with me.

619
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,540
Have a drink.

620
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,540
- maybe later?
- Why not now?

621
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,690
I have a meeting.

622
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,590
Um,how about you give me your phone

623
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:46,730
- and I'll give you my number and you call me in a 1/2 hour?
- Okay.

624
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:52,100
- Ma'am,your check.
- Oh,thank you.

625
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,360
Thanks.

626
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,630
- All right.
- Thanks.

627
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,630
- Promise to call?
- Promise.

628
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,030
Neal,that's him.

629
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,910
Did you get a hold of Peter?

630
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,130
No.Voicemail.

631
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,930
Wait here.I need to
see where they're going.

632
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:30,940
Oh,no,I'm coming.

633
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,850
All right,tell me
everything that happened.

634
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,700
Well,um,okay,I flirted with him.

635
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,860
- He tried to flirt back,but he was not very good at it.
- Keep going.

636
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,210
He seemed anxious to leave.

637
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,060
He said maybe meet up in 30 minutes
and he put his number in my phone.

638
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,260
He put his number in
your phone?Let me see it.

639
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,900
What is that?

640
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,460
Some kind of new microchip.

641
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,670
All Peter told me was
that it's about security.

642
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,890
I think we found what he
and Jill are looking for.

643
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,540
Shouldn't he be waiting for us?

644
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,330
Like you said,we're early.

645
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,780
He's playing it cool.

646
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,360
Honey,I told you,it's the wrong room.

647
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,690
Hey,I saw you the other day.

648
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,240
Taking pictures...of us.

649
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,170
We're honeymooners.

650
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:42,420
We thought this was our room,but our
key doesn't work,so I guess it isn't.

651
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,510
There's only one room on this end.

652
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,870
We don't--we don't
want any trouble.

653
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,620
We'll just be leaving,all right?

654
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,230
What's in the bag?

655
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,680
Nothing.

656
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:53,830
Clothes.

657
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,780
Open it.

658
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,930
Open it,or you go from
honeymooner to widow.

659
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,870
Buyers or feds.

660
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,390
Cash says that you're
either one or the other.

661
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:14,360
Third option.We're newlyweds who
don't believe in credit cards.

662
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,240
He's an old-fashioned kind of guy.

663
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,360
That I am.

664
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,790
I-I don't know who he
is,but she's a buyer.

665
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,760
The deal was supposed to
go down today.Right now.

666
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,450
The chip!

667
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,950
I hid it on a woman downstairs.

668
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,230
What woman?

669
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,120
Wait.We're both buyers.

670
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,120
Iranian interests.

671
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:37,810
Well,at least I was until this morning.

672
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,210
North Korea came calling.

673
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:45,820
- Our partnership wasn't gonna make it past the parking garage.
- Son of a bitch.

674
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:50,920
Their country would be very grateful
if the two of you joined our team.

675
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,020
Extremely grateful.

676
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,740
Look,kill the both of them.

677
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,060
You can take the money.

678
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,980
I'll cut you in on my half
of the chip.Just untie me.

679
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,730
All right,you have to go downstairs.

680
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,460
I have the chip.I'm going in.

681
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,050
Give it to me.I'll take it in.

682
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,470
Are you gonna help me get in
there,or am I gonna have to knock?

683
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,400
Let's discuss this.

684
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,960
I don't know who you're working
for or what they're paying you,

685
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,120
but the North Koreans will beat it.

686
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,640
They can't even feed their own people.

687
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,810
Shut up.

688
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,510
What are you looking for,newlywed?

689
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,250
All right.

690
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,130
- You never saw this.
- What is that?

691
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,080
It's something Mozzie and I made.

692
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,180
Now go in there like you own the place.

693
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,780
Show them the chip,but
keep it away from them.

694
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,450
Okay,try to buy me 30 seconds.

695
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,570
Careful.

696
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,300
I asked you a question,newlywed.

697
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,680
I've got what you want.

698
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,540
Hon,get out of here now.

699
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,020
Th--that's
her.

700
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,620
That's the woman I stashed the chip on.

701
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,320
He's right.

702
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,610
It's,uh--it's
in here.

703
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,090
It's,um--I
have it.

704
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,110
it's--it's
right here.

705
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,550
It's--it's in
the phone case.

706
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,500
FBI.

707
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,470
Oh,that was incredible.

708
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,770
But don't do anything like that again.

709
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,540
I don't know if I can promise that.

710
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,130
All right,we got two men down.

711
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,150
Another typical day at White Collar.

712
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,750
Well,I fulfilled one
of my fondest dreams.

713
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,540
- Yeah,what's that?
- Working with you.

714
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,210
It was fun.

715
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,170
We did talk about
that at Quantico a lot.

716
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,320
It lived up to expectations.

717
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,480
But you had bigger dreams back then.

718
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,260
Washington.

719
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,460
Soon?

720
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,470
Once I've tied up all
the loose ends here.

721
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,330
Yeah.I can't just bring
anyone in to be Neal's handler.

722
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,630
I gotta make sure
they're up to the task.

723
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,980
- Peter.
- What?

724
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,860
- There'll always be loose ends.
- Yeah.

725
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,120
Yeah,and there's one you
might be able to help me with.

726
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,250
Uh,this one is a cold case that
has been gnawing at me for 20 years.

727
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,460
Why California?

728
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,930
You were top in our class.

729
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,960
You could have had any
assignment you wanted.

730
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,330
I took an assignment.

731
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,280
First female SSG agent
on the west coast.

732
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,120
- How could I turn that down?
- I wouldn't have stopped you.

733
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,080
You wanted New York.D.C.

734
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,200
That was your dream.

735
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,400
You ran.

736
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,080
You didn't chase after me.

737
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,870
You would have just run faster.

738
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,740
You're right.I would have.

739
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:57,300
At least this way we can remember
Quantico as the beautiful thing it was.

740
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,610
Let's do that.

741
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,920
Where you headed?

742
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,440
Off to Miami.Another case.

743
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,440
Well,I hope another case
brings you to New York again.

744
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,890
Yeah,maybe I'll bring my El with me.

745
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,300
- Male edition.
- Good luck finding one.

746
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,410
She's one in a million.

747
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,020
Don't be afraid to talk to her,Peter.

748
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,890
About anything.

749
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:44,070
I should have talked to you about this a long
time ago,but I can't stop thinking about him.

750
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:48,370
I can't shake the feeling that if I
hadn't become ASAC he'd still be alive.

751
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,460
Just trust me,okay?

752
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,260
- Can I open my eyes?
- No,you can't.

753
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,670
Step
down--curb.Curb.

754
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,420
There you go.

755
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,850
It's not that big of a curb.

756
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,460
I don't like surprises.

757
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,390
- They never turn out good.
- All right,we're almost there.

758
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,410
You know,you should know that
walking the streets of New York blind

759
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,390
is a recurring nightmare of mine.

760
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,020
You can open your eyes.

761
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,180
It's the window from the codex.

762
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,070
How did you ever find it?

763
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:23,060
Agent Gruetzner used some
of his underworld contacts.

764
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,480
It's beautiful.

765
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,200
Not professional.

766
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,800
No.

767
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,180
Not professional at all.

768
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,210
C***
