1
00:00:06,579 --> 00:00:07,888
快看
Aw, look.

2
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:10,841
爺爺奶奶一定為你準備了有趣的一天
I bet Grandma and Grandpa have a fun day planned for you.

3
00:00:10,842 --> 00:00:12,441
沒  沒有  我們不能照看喜旺
No, we don't. We can't watch Hope.

4
00:00:12,442 --> 00:00:14,623
而且  你需要幫我們照看曾奶奶
In fact, you need to watch Maw Maw for us.

5
00:00:14,624 --> 00:00:15,733
你媽和我要去參加
Your mother and I are competing

6
00:00:15,734 --> 00:00:17,725
納什維爾的扛老婆大賽
in the Natesville Wife Carrying Competition.

7
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,686
大塊頭喬和他的矮鬼老婆離婚了
Big Joe and his dwarf wife got divorced.

8
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:20,877
所以我們今年很有希望獲勝
So we really have a shot this year.

9
00:00:20,878 --> 00:00:22,232
不是吧  爹媽  這不公平
Come on, guys. No fair.

10
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:24,053
上周末就是我替你們照看曾奶奶的
I watched Maw Maw for you last weekend.

11
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:26,976
多年來  我爸媽已經摸索出一套獨門秘籍
Over the years, my parents had developed a little strategy

12
00:00:26,977 --> 00:00:28,197
來達成他們的目的
to get what they wanted.

13
00:00:28,198 --> 00:00:29,099
他們稱之為
They called it

14
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,733
"紅臉警  白臉警"
"Bad Cop, Sad Cop."

15
00:00:30,734 --> 00:00:32,088
你敢停我們家的煤氣  
You turn off our gas,

16
00:00:32,088 --> 00:00:34,855
老娘就讓你變成一個加氣站的充氣員
I'll have you busted down to pumping gas.

17
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:37,106
你不能停掉我們家的煤氣
You can't turn off our gas.

18
00:00:37,318 --> 00:00:39,129
這只雞還沒烤熟呢
This rotisserie chicken is barely cooked.

19
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,804
人家吃生肉會死掉的
If we eat this, we'll die!

20
00:00:43,363 --> 00:00:45,807
如果你不讓我們進去  我就讓你從一個
If you don't let us in, I'll have you busted down

21
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:48,659
檢票員變成"檢尿員"
from checking credentials to checking urinal cakes.

22
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,212
遺愿基金會說有免費票送給我們的
The Last Wish Foundation said there'd be tickets for us.

23
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:04,410
老娘就讓你從一個
I will have you busted down

24
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:06,613
交通女警變成一個家庭女傭
from meter maid to regular maid.

25
00:01:06,614 --> 00:01:09,586
我可告訴你  野餐都用不起桌布
And trust me, that is a picnic without a blanket.

26
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:12,494
我們也就遲到了62分鐘而已
We're barely 62 minutes late.

27
00:01:12,495 --> 00:01:15,242
求你了  我丟了工作  我的狗狗也死了
Please, I lost my job. My dog died.

28
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:17,830
我最好的朋友上戰場后再也沒回來
My best friend didn't make it back from the war...

29
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:19,044
是減肥之戰
on obesity.

30
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,007
我不會把你們的車拖走的
I'm not gonna tow your car.

31
00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:25,137
我只是很遺憾沒辦法收回那張罰單
The only thing I regret is not being able to take back that ticket.

32
00:01:28,748 --> 00:01:29,809
如果你不照顧曾奶奶
If you don't watch Maw Maw,

33
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,105
老娘就把你變成繼子
I will bust you down to stepchild.

34
00:01:32,106 --> 00:01:33,874
如果你覺得你之前的待遇已經夠糟糕了
And if you think you had it bad before,

35
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,564
那是因為你還沒見識真正的慘狀
you ain't seen nothing yet.

36
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:37,796
你剛剛吐在咖啡桌上了
You just spit on the coffee table.

37
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,084
吉米  求你了
Jimmy, please?

38
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:40,459
業務慘淡
Business is slow.

39
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,924
我也沒有退休儲蓄
I have no retirement savings.

40
00:01:41,925 --> 00:01:43,239
我兒子是個廢物
My son's a disappointment.

41
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,871
好吧  當然了
Well, yes, of course.

42
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:47,048
我愿意替你們照看曾奶奶
I'll-I'll watch Maw Maw for you.

43
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:48,375
太棒了
Great.

44
00:01:48,414 --> 00:01:49,350
我們很晚才會回來
We'll be out late.

45
00:01:49,372 --> 00:01:50,370
我們絕對可以去當警察
We totally could've been cops.

46
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:51,874
讓這座城市純凈無瑕
We'd clean this city up.

47
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:05,136
你們好啊  吉斯一家
Hello, Chances.

48
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:11,113
謝謝你親自上門拜訪  沃利
Thank you for meeting us at the house, Wally.

49
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,284
沒什么
Not a problem.

50
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,689
我剛在街角的老巫女那洗完牙
The old voodoo woman who whitens my teeth lives around the corner.

51
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,867
這是我形象改造的一部分
It's part of my makeover.

52
00:02:19,868 --> 00:02:22,074
你們覺得我看上去多大了  等等  等等
How old do you think I look? Whoa, whoa!

53
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:24,013
不準說錯
There's no wrong answer.

54
00:02:24,014 --> 00:02:25,753
-72歲  -錯
- 72. - Wrong answer.

55
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:28,047
你干啥要這么折騰自己
Why are you trying to euthanize yourself?

56
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,480
我手頭有個大案子
I've got a big case

57
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:32,880
那個檢察官雇了兩個"美律"
and the prosecutor has hired two young "LILFs"

58
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:34,585
來動搖陪審團
to sway the jury.

59
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:37,780
美律是指"我想調戲的美女律師"
"Lawyers I'd Like to Frolic with."

60
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:39,980
不是吧  各位  這是不言自明的
Come on, guys. It's self-explanatory.

61
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:41,170
我能理解
Makes sense to me.

62
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,749
我們都知道OJ辛普森是有罪的
Like we knew O.J. was guilty

63
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,469
指辛普森涉嫌殺妻案  瑪莎為首席檢察官

64
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,469
因為瑪莎·克拉克實在太性感了
because Marcia Clark was so hot.

65
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,031
我對那個案子不熟
I'm not familiar with that case.

66
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,491
但閑話扯夠了
But enough small talk.

67
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:50,706
我15分鐘后要去做蜜蠟修眉了
I have to get to my eyebrow wax in 15 minutes.

68
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:51,992
你們這次又犯什么事了
What did you guys do now?

69
00:02:51,993 --> 00:02:52,937
我們可什么事都沒犯
We didn't do anything.

70
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:54,891
實際上  這次犯事的人是我
Actually, this time, it's me.

71
00:02:55,332 --> 00:02:58,066
你在水族館一定會玩得很開心的
Oh, you are gonna have so much fun at the aquarium.

72
00:02:58,067 --> 00:02:58,846
好了
All right.

73
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:01,124
我就在這兒等你回來 好嗎
And I'll be right here when you get back, okay?

74
00:03:01,377 --> 00:03:02,416
吉斯太太  抱歉
Oh, uh, Mrs. Chance, I'm sorry.

75
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:03,881
我不能讓喜旺上車
I can't let Hope on the bus.

76
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:06,165
她的同意書必須由法定監護人來簽
Her permission slip needs to be signed by a legal guardian.

77
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,689
我跟她爸已經結婚了  所以沒事
Oh, well, I'm married to her father, so...

78
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,695
不  抱歉
No, I'm sorry.

79
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:10,049
為了孩子們的安全考慮
It's for the kids' safety.

80
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:10,833
真的嗎
Really.

81
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:12,056
你有臉說這話  
Says the person

82
00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:13,750
你都雇了個在臉上穿孔
who hired the psycho with the face piercings

83
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:15,298
又搞淚痕紋身的神經病來開車呢
and the teardrop tattoo to drive the bus?

84
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:16,916
那個"神經病"是我丈夫
That "Psycho" is my husband.

85
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:19,968
那淚痕紋身是為祭奠蘇丹那些慘死的孩子
And the teardrop is a tribute to the lost children of Sudan.

86
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:28,860
所以  我希望能正式領養喜旺
So, I would like to officially adopt Hope.

87
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:29,715
我明白了
I see.

88
00:03:29,716 --> 00:03:32,850
盡管我很想接這個案子
Well, as much as I would like to handle that...

89
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,713
但這可是很貴的
it's expensive.

90
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,601
這兩個人還欠我
And these two still owe me

91
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:39,747
上次狀告藍色牛仔公司
from when they sued the blue jean company

92
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:41,045
用紐扣代替拉鏈一案的律師費
over the "Button-fly."

93
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:42,273
不是吧  爹媽
Seriously, guys?

94
00:03:42,274 --> 00:03:43,133
我很忙的
I'm a busy man

95
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:44,934
用紐扣太浪費我寶貴的時間
and those people have stolen minutes from my life.

96
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:48,145
我敢肯定他們打算付你錢的  對吧
I-I'm sure that they intend to pay you back... right?

97
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,836
你聽說過"伯特幣"嗎
Have you heard of something called "Burt Bucks"?

98
00:03:52,017 --> 00:03:52,933
當然
Yes.

99
00:03:53,181 --> 00:03:56,191
我就是那個讓你擺脫偽造罪名的律師
I'm the one that got you off the counterfeiting charge.

100
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:57,633
那個案子你也沒付我錢
You didn't pay me for that either.

101
00:03:57,634 --> 00:03:59,309
我很遺憾  塞布麗娜
Well, sorry, Sabrina.

102
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,902
我看你永遠做不了喜旺的合法母親了
I guess you'll never be Hope's real mom.

103
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:01,520
我們盡力了
We tried.

104
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:03,330
等等  我剛剛突然想到
Wait, I'm starting to think

105
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:06,109
一個年輕性感的種馬或許不足以
that one hot, young stud might not be enough

106
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,275
贏下此案
to win this case.

107
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:08,847
我可以接領養案
So, I'll do the adoption,

108
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:12,708
除非你們愿意坐在我旁邊  扮演美麗的花瓶
if you two sit at my table as extra eye candy.

109
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:16,433
假扮律師肯定會超有趣的
It would be so fun to pretend to be lawyers.

110
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:17,254
或許我可以像艾麗·麥克比爾
I could be just like the one

111
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:18,895
在《甜心俏佳人》中的角色一樣
Ally McBeal played on that show.

112
00:04:18,896 --> 00:04:21,382
我可以像《執法悍將》中的那個軍人一樣
I could be like that cool army guy on JAG.

113
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:23,828
我一直想找個借口穿白褲子
I've always wanted an excuse to wear white pants.

114
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:24,683
我們愿意
We'll do it.

115
00:04:24,684 --> 00:04:26,174
有了你們這綠葉的陪襯
With you two lookers,

116
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:28,409
我就不需要打扮了
I won't need this anymore.

117
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,019
現在
Now...

118
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,226
你們誰能不能幫我
if one of you wouldn't mind helping me...

119
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:33,735
把這塊膠帶扯掉
pull off this tape.

120
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:44,537
有沃利在  我們終于可以
With Wally on board, we could finally

121
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:46,319
把領養手續辦下來了
make the adoption official.

122
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:48,644
多露出一點牙齒
How about a little more teeth?

123
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,014
完美
Perfect.

124
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:53,081
太棒了  我們可以拍一張正式照片呢
Cool, we get an official picture.

125
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,092
下一位
Next.

126
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,282
到我們了
That's us.

127
00:04:55,283 --> 00:04:56,461
請收好
Here you go.

128
00:04:59,787 --> 00:05:01,237
好了  再見
Okay, bye.

129
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,799
我  我以為你會
I... I thought you were gonna

130
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:04,788
讓我們宣誓
swear us in.

131
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:06,464
這不是個就職儀式
This isn't an inauguration.

132
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:08,350
那我們就拍照片好了
We'll just get to the picture then.

133
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,728
這個相機只用作公事用
This camera's only for official business.

134
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:13,349
不  我剛剛正式領養了這個小女孩  所以
No, I just officially adopted this little girl, so...

135
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,306
這個相機只是給官方打獵許可證使用的
For official hunting licenses.

136
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:17,297
明天開始就是乳鴿的季節了
Squab season starts tomorrow.

137
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:20,593
很好  那我們就申請一個全家的打獵許可證
Great, then we'll take one family hunting license, please.

138
00:05:20,594 --> 00:05:22,261
你要去打乳鴿嗎
Are you going to go squab hunting?

139
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:24,158
是  你沒聽錯  
Yes, you know what? Yes.

140
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:25,233
來這
Here, come on.

141
00:05:27,164 --> 00:05:28,201
我們全家想要
My family and I would like

142
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,722
申請一個打乳鴿許可證  老娘才不管乳鴿是啥
one license to kill whatever a squab is.

143
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:32,975
我不給不打獵的人簽發許可證的
I don't issue licenses to non-hunters.

144
00:05:32,976 --> 00:05:33,912
這樣搞會讓打獵證跌價的
It cheapens it.

145
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:35,198
別這樣嘛  說真的
Come on, honestly.

146
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,018
這對你來說能有多難啊  
How hard is it really to just, like,

147
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:39,351
不就按下按鈕給我們
click your little button and take a picture

148
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:40,896
拍張照片嘛
of me and my family?

149
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,754
對了  我手機可以拍照啊
You know, I-I got a camera on my phone.

150
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:44,938
我們可以就在外面拍張照片
We could just take a picture outside.

151
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:47,750
他們有個漂亮的薔薇叢  還有那個
They got a-a nice rosebush, and that-that statue

152
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:49,723
一個瞎女人托著重物的雕像
of that blind woman holding weights.

153
00:05:50,782 --> 00:05:51,580
只是
It just...

154
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,946
噢  你領養了一只小狗
Oh, someone's adopting a puppy.

155
00:05:55,998 --> 00:05:57,720
我一定要拍張照片才行
I've got to get a picture of this.

156
00:05:57,721 --> 00:05:59,260
哇靠  
Oh, come on!

157
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:00,438
搞毛啊
Really?

158
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:04,868
那個波蘭紳士說道
This Polish gentlemen said,

159
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:07,374
我不知道那是個小丁丁
"I didn't know it was a penis."

160
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,658
不要笑
Hold for laughter.

161
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,088
先向陪審團行禮
Salute jury.

162
00:06:10,992 --> 00:06:14,137
我在佛羅里達碰到這個律師
I saw this lawyer at a trial in Florida

163
00:06:14,138 --> 00:06:16,172
在法庭上以一個敲門笑話開頭
open with a knock-knock joke.

164
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:17,388
相信我
Trust me.

165
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:18,632
效果贊爆了
It killed.

166
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:21,702
這樣如何  當你說"他無罪"時
How about when you say, "He's not guilty,"

167
00:06:21,702 --> 00:06:23,744
我試著讓法庭上所有人說
I'll try to get the whole courtroom to say,

168
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:25,639
"他哪里無罪啊"
"How not guilty is he?"

169
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,928
不  不  不  不  你什么也別說
No, no, no, no. You-you say nothing.

170
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,899
但我們昨天一整晚都在看《大律師邁拉克》
But we stayed up all night watching Matlock.

171
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,899
律政美劇

172
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,888
伯特學南部律師很像的
Burt does a great Southern lawyer.

173
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,792
我叫布朗
My name is Brown.

174
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:37,886
我反對這個學校董事會
And I am against this board of education.

175
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:39,523
我佩服你所做的努力
I admire your commitment.

176
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,688
但我也知道對你來說
But I also know how difficult it is

177
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:43,396
穿帶紐扣門襟的褲子有多難
for you to button your fly.

178
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,398
所以
Therefore,

179
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,091
你閉嘴就好
you-you stay quiet.

180
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,127
我的天
My God.

181
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:07,079
她有兩個漂亮的手下
She's got one good-looking posse.

182
00:07:07,395 --> 00:07:10,498
好了  就跟我們排練的一樣
All right, just like we practiced.

183
00:07:11,578 --> 00:07:13,851
-法律顧問你好  -法律顧問你好
- Counselor.  - Counselor.

184
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:20,393
行了
Okay.

185
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,206
游戲開始了
Game on.

186
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,123
天  剛剛那下累死我了
Wow, that took a lot out of me.

187
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:30,793
當律師比我想得難多了
Being a lawyer's a lot harder than I thought.

188
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:33,571
現在我明白為什么他們按小時計費了
Now I know why they charge by the hour.

189
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,405
剛剛那下才  30秒左右吧
That was only, like, 30 seconds.

190
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:36,609
我就累壞了
I'm exhausted.

191
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:40,896
我分娩了四個小時
So, I'd been in labor for four hours

192
00:07:40,897 --> 00:07:42,530
外面還下著大雨
and it's pouring rain outside.

193
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:44,612
但就在我的斯凱拉出生的那個瞬間
But right then when my Skylar was born,

194
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:46,323
一道閃電劃過窗戶
a ray of light came through the window.

195
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:48,954
我完全可以理解你所說的
I know exactly what you're talking about.

196
00:07:51,057 --> 00:07:52,498
當你第一次看到喜旺時  你什么感覺
What was it like when you first saw Hope?

197
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:53,835
那真的很
It was really...

198
00:07:54,777 --> 00:07:55,665
神奇
magical.

199
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,320
生喜旺可能是
Giving birth to Hope was

200
00:07:57,321 --> 00:08:00,244
我這輩子做過最棒的事情了
probably the best thing I ever did with my life.

201
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:01,070
真的  我只是非常幸運
Really I was just lucky

202
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:05,025
能有吉米在旁幫我把喜旺拖出來
that Jimmy was there to help me push it out of my body.

203
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,403
你們倆上過育嬰課嗎
You guys took baby classes?

204
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:09,233
當然  我們上了  兩年課
Yeah, we took, uh, two years.

205
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:10,756
我跟吉米
Jimmy and I were very,

206
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:14,828
都把生孩子看得很重要
very serious about baby birth.

207
00:08:18,535 --> 00:08:20,831
首先 當發現領養小孩不過是蓋幾個章時
First, she seemed upset that the adoption

208
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:22,311
她應該覺得很不爽  
was just a rubber stamp.

209
00:08:22,312 --> 00:08:23,942
接著  我知道的第二件事是
Then, next thing I know,

210
00:08:23,943 --> 00:08:25,534
她說自己用母乳喂養喜旺
she's saying she breast-fed Hope

211
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:26,818
一天兩加侖[相當于7.5升]
two gallons of milk a day.

212
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,298
我不是專家
Now, I am no expert.

213
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,455
但這個量對一個95磅重的女人太多了吧
But this seems like a lot for a 95-pound woman.

214
00:08:31,456 --> 00:08:33,111
塞布麗娜可能覺得自己錯過了
Maybe Sabrina feels like she missed out

215
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,606
母性中整個生孩子的部分吧
on the whole "Having a baby" Part of motherhood.

216
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:36,453
對
Yeah.

217
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:39,712
對于我們來說  生小孩不過是
To us, giving birth just seems like

218
00:08:39,905 --> 00:08:41,945
一個痛苦的  惡心的
a painful, disgusting,

219
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:44,344
殘忍的生物學玩笑
cruel joke of biology.

220
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:46,742
但對于女人來說  那就是他們的"超級碗"啊
But to women, it's their Super Bowl.

221
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:46,742
超級碗  美國橄欖球聯盟決賽

222
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:49,155
當我的繼母跟塞布麗娜有同樣的想法時
When my non-birth mother was feeling the way Sabrina is,

223
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:51,520
我另一個媽會把她橄欖球隊的女孩叫到一起
my other mother got the ladies from her rugby team together

224
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:54,164
她們會給我繼母舉辦一個再生儀式的
and they threw her a rebirthing ceremony.

225
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:55,262
你到底想表達什么
Where do you go for that?

226
00:08:55,263 --> 00:08:57,318
我的媽媽們去佛蒙特州
Well, my moms went to a bar

227
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,897
一個叫"安東尼沙龍"的酒吧
in Vermont called Saloon B. Anthony.

228
00:08:58,898 --> 00:09:00,728
但你可以自己來嘛
But you could do it yourself.

229
00:09:00,744 --> 00:09:02,105
我自己怎么做一個再生儀式啊
How am I supposed to do a rebirthing?

230
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:03,597
我還從來沒有看過真正的生產呢
I've never even seen an actual birth.

231
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:04,689
喜旺是在監獄里出生的
Hope was born in a jail.

232
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,722
我跟弗蘭克可以幫你
Frank and I could help you.

233
00:09:05,723 --> 00:09:07,004
哦  當然 
Oh, yeah, totally.

234
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:09,211
再生儀式很簡單
Rebirthing ceremonies are simple.

235
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:13,535
你懂的  有時失眠癥會驅使
Sometimes insomnia can drive a man

236
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:16,463
一個人進入網絡深處陰暗的角落的
to the deep dark corners of the Internet.

237
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:19,447
那個波蘭人說
That is when the Polish man said,

238
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,381
"我不知道那是個小丁丁"
"I didn't know it was a penis."

239
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,192
她偷了我的笑話
She stole my joke!

240
00:09:24,193 --> 00:09:26,155
我整個開場白都是
My entire opening argument

241
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:27,720
基于這個笑話的
was built on that joke!

242
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:30,465
你們將要發現的唯一一件事情
...the only thing that you'll come to realize...

243
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:32,038
就是
is...

244
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:33,373
那個男人
that man,

245
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:34,399
鮑比·保曼
Bobby Bowman,

246
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,328
是個偷電動車的賊
is a moped thief.

247
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:38,789
我會跟你們證明
And I will prove that to you

248
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,302
這事兒簡直就是不言自明
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

249
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:42,586
菲普斯先生  你可以開始了
Mr. Phipps, your opening statement?

250
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,460
我有個更好的開場笑話
I have an even better opening joke.

251
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:49,830
但在我說之前
But before I tell it,

252
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:53,589
問下你們之間有誰被小丑調戲過嗎
have any of you ever been molested by a clown?

253
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:02,997
我沒什么好說的了
I've got nothing.

254
00:10:02,998 --> 00:10:04,512
你辦得到的
You can do this.

255
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:06,365
記住  你沒必要說得那么好
Remember, you don't have to be that good

256
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:08,202
因為我們是如此漂亮
because we're that beautiful.

257
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:16,009
尊敬的陪審團
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

258
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:17,573
我跟我的
me and my...

259
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:22,101
引人注目  帥氣逼人的同事
noticeably handsome colleagues

260
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:28,107
有超過1000年的法學院學習經驗
have over 1,000 years of law school between the three of us.

261
00:10:28,108 --> 00:10:30,343
我敢打賭你們肯定不會
I dare you to not be

262
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:32,097
在智力上
both intellectually

263
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,760
和身體上被同時喚醒
and physically aroused.

264
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:38,442
我說完了  法官大人
Nothing more, Your Honor...

265
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,716
因為我眼前全是星星
...because all I see are stars.

266
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:50,751
他怎么可能是無罪的
How not guilty is he?

267
00:10:57,098 --> 00:10:59,219
別擔心  我死不了
Don't worry, I'm not gonna die.

268
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:03,126
有個神準的預言家告訴我
I have it on the authority of a very reputable fortune teller

269
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:04,877
我能活到...
that I would live to be...

270
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:08,322
等等  我多大了
Wait, how old am I?

271
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:13,268
至少在我們偽裝律師的職業生涯中
Well, at least our careers as pretend lawyers

272
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:15,650
還沒輸過一場官司
are ending without us ever losing a case.

273
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:17,507
我會想念這副眼鏡的
I'm really gonna miss these glasses.

274
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:18,793
它讓我覺得我是文化人
They make me feel so smart.

275
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:20,778
你們不能走啊
Wait, you guys cannot go.

276
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:22,480
我可沒錢再請其他律師了
I can't afford another lawyer.

277
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,245
我們真的很想幫你  但是
We really want to help, but...

278
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:26,308
我們不是你以為的那種律師
we're not the kind of lawyers you think we are.

279
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:28,088
那你們擅長打什么官司
Okay, so what's your specialty?

280
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:29,999
受害人很特殊的
Cases with special victims,

281
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,344
蓄意傷害之類的
criminals with intent.

282
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:34,062
你知道  上頭條的那種
You know, ripped from the headlines kind of stuff.

283
00:11:34,063 --> 00:11:36,117
我是無辜的
Okay, look, I'm innocent.

284
00:11:36,118 --> 00:11:37,948
只有你們能救我了
All right, you guys are my only hope.

285
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:39,659
這是玩真的
This is serious.

286
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,459
他需要我們
He needs us.

287
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,929
我知道  但我們幫不了
I know, but we can't do this.

288
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,493
超出我們的腦力了
We're in way over our heads.

289
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,187
知道她腦子里還有什么嗎
You know who else was in over her head?

290
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,133
《律政俏佳人》里的瑞茜·威瑟斯彭
Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde,

291
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:48,122
她從不放棄
and she never gave up.

292
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,386
還有《吉娃娃律師所》里的狗律師
Neither did the dog lawyer in Chihuahua Attorney:

293
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:51,710
正義之咬
Justice Bites.

294
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,622
如果那狗能打贏最高法院
And if that dog can win a case against the Supreme Court,

295
00:11:54,623 --> 00:11:55,763
我們也能做到
we can do this.

296
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,495
法官大人
Your Highness,

297
00:11:58,743 --> 00:12:00,845
即使菲普斯先生不在  我們也想繼續下
we'd like to continue on without Mr. Phipps.

298
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:03,380
請對我們要求松一點
Just be prepared to keep us on a short leash,

299
00:12:03,381 --> 00:12:05,054
但您最后一定會明白我們的意思
but ultimately, you'll see where we're going

300
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:06,882
并且同意我們的觀點
with this and allow it.

301
00:12:09,788 --> 00:12:10,965
還有幾步
Just a few more steps.

302
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:13,186
拜托是繩球  拜托是繩球
Ooh, please be a tetherball, please be a tetherball.

303
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,080
嚇死我了
Everything about this scares me.

304
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:18,557
吉米  這是搞什么
Jimmy, what the hell is going on?

305
00:12:18,558 --> 00:12:20,307
是新生儀式
It's a rebirthing ceremony.

306
00:12:20,308 --> 00:12:21,438
驚喜吧
Surprise!

307
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:22,304
我們要模仿分娩
We're going to simulate childbirth

308
00:12:22,304 --> 00:12:24,420
讓你體驗一把做媽媽的感覺
so you can feel like a real mom.

309
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:26,759
歡迎來到你的超級碗
Welcome to your Super Bowl.

310
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,455
吉米  你為什么要這么做
Jimmy, why would you do this?

311
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,045
在市政廳的時候他們沒把我們的領養當回事
Because you seemed so upset at City Hall

312
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:32,653
我看你有點生氣
when they didn't make a big deal out of the adoption.

313
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:34,444
就覺得你需要更多
I thought that, you know, you wanted more

314
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:35,751
做母親的感覺
of a motherhood moment.

315
00:12:35,752 --> 00:12:37,974
我只是氣他們的官僚作風
No, I-I just was upset about the bureaucracy of it.

316
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:40,152
憑什么又矮又胖的獵鴿犯能拍照  我們卻不能
Like, why should a squab killer get a photo and we don't?

317
00:12:40,153 --> 00:12:42,547
那你為什么要騙斯凱拉和他的媽媽們
Why did you lie to the mothers of Skylar and Skylar?

318
00:12:42,573 --> 00:12:43,525
我是說  我聽到你跟他們說
I mean, I heard you telling them

319
00:12:43,526 --> 00:12:45,178
你是喜旺的親生媽媽
that you gave birth to Hope.

320
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:46,598
-你聽到了  -對
- Oh, you heard that? - Yeah.

321
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,756
其他媽媽都在說自己寶寶的故事
The other moms were talking about their baby stories,

322
00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:50,125
我感覺自己都沒怎么參與過
and I just didn't feel like getting

323
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:51,529
喜旺的出生和成長
into the whole thing about Hope.

324
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,991
沒什么大不了的  只是
It's not a big deal, it's just...

325
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:56,095
我說謊是因為有時候說謊比坦白容易
Sometimes I lie when it's easier than telling the truth.

326
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:58,089
不做這個儀式我無所謂
Look, I'm all right if we don't do this,

327
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,704
但還有一個幫忙的人
but there was another person helping.

328
00:13:05,556 --> 00:13:07,266
她都排練了一天了
She's been practicing all day.

329
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:09,698
搞毛啊
What the heck?

330
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:10,521
好吧
All right, fine.

331
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:12,279
那咱開始吧  因為
Then let's get to it because...

332
00:13:13,578 --> 00:13:15,060
你的羊水破了
...your water just broke.

333
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:18,533
倫諾克斯先生  你能指出
Mr. Lennox, would you point to the man

334
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:20,446
偷你電動車的那個人嗎
you saw steal your moped?

335
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:22,362
彎腰系鞋帶
Bend down and tie your shoe.

336
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:24,062
我確定他也會把手放低的
I'm pretty sure he'd just point lower.

337
00:13:24,063 --> 00:13:25,943
請記錄  倫諾克斯先生
Let the record show that Mr. Lennox

338
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:28,031
指向了被告
pointed to the defendant.

339
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:40,689
沒用
That didn't work.

340
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:42,844
玩《法律與秩序》里的"我收回"那招
Do that "Withdrawn" trick they do on Law and Order.

341
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:43,676
對對
Yeah, yeah.

342
00:13:46,478 --> 00:13:48,261
倫諾克斯先生
Mr. Lennox,

343
00:13:48,434 --> 00:13:51,724
你的愛好是斬掉狗狗的頭  這是真的嗎
is it true that you decapitate puppies as a hobby?

344
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:53,013
我收回
Withdrawn.

345
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:55,119
你是塔利班的成員吧
Weren't you a member of the Taliban?

346
00:13:55,322 --> 00:13:56,390
我收回
Withdrawn.

347
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:59,103
你有戀童癖  我收回
A pedophile? Withdrawn.

348
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,927
是個賊  我收回
A thief? Withdrawn.

349
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,749
曾在鱷梨園里大便
Defecated in an avocado field?

350
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:05,075
我收回
Withdrawn.

351
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:06,923
吉斯先生  你夠了啊
Mr. Chance, enough of this.

352
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:08,515
尼瑪《法律與秩序》
Damn Law and Order

353
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:10,517
把整代律師全給毀了
ruined an entire generation of lawyers.

354
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,106
休庭
I'm calling a recess.

355
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:16,865
休庭耶
Ooh, recess.

356
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:18,464
出去溜達十分鐘
Maybe it would be good for us to go outside

357
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:20,142
應該不錯
and run around for about ten minutes.

358
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:27,811
好了  開始宮縮
Okay, contractions are starting.

359
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:30,657
你想自然分娩還是打麻藥
You gonna go natural or you want some drugs?

360
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:31,734
等等  你們真有麻藥嗎
Wait, do you actually have drugs?

361
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:33,461
沒時間打麻藥了
There's no time for drugs!

362
00:14:33,462 --> 00:14:34,684
寶寶要出來了
This baby's coming!

363
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:35,548
勇敢一點
Brace yourselves.

364
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:36,469
呼吸  塞布麗娜
Breathe, Sabrina.

365
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,359
親愛的加油  你可以的
Come on, baby, you can do it.

366
00:14:39,808 --> 00:14:41,270
還真有點激動  吉米
This is actually kind of exciting, Jimmy.

367
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:43,142
呼吸得很好
Yeah, your breathing is great.

368
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:46,040
找準一個點  然后盯著它
Now, pick a focal point and stare at it.

369
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,191
厲害吧  我看過專業書
Yeah, I read a book.

370
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:50,993
我很慶幸沒打麻藥
I'm really glad we didn't take those drugs.

371
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:52,097
因為親身感受這個過程
I feel like it's really important

372
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:53,418
對我來說真的很重要
for me to be present through this.

373
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:55,513
做完這個  我就成人造陰道領域的權威了
When this is over, I call dibs on the faux-gina.

374
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:57,872
我要多幫助那些不孕不育的夫妻
I want to do more of these for deserving barren couples.

375
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:02,100
好了  來吧
Okay, here we go.

376
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:06,072
-我們要有寶寶了  -我知道
- We are having a baby! - I know!

377
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:06,589
快點好嗎
But soon, right?

378
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:08,608
她在管子里待了有一會兒了吧
'Cause I feel like she's been in that tube for a while.

379
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:10,478
媽咪  我卡住了
Mommy, I'm stuck!

380
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:11,287
什么
What?

381
00:15:11,302 --> 00:15:12,502
她怎么會被卡住
Wait, how can she be stuck?

382
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:13,889
實事求是地說
In the spirit of realism,

383
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,957
管子可能被人用意面塞滿了
someone may have stuffed the tube with spaghetti.

384
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,821
什么  為什么要這么做
What? Why would you do something like that?

385
00:15:17,822 --> 00:15:20,132
在馬后炮之前  我提醒一下
Before we start Monday morning quarterbacking,

386
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:22,984
這主意是我們一起在一個下午里想出來的
just remember we threw this together in an afternoon.

387
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,759
喜旺  撐住
Hope, hang on.

388
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:26,529
爸比來了
Daddy's coming.

389
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,890
于是我從窗戶望出去
And so I looked out the window,

390
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:30,990
就看到他在偷我的電動車
and that's when I saw him steal my moped.

391
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:35,700
你最后一次擦窗戶是什么時候
And when was the last time that window was cleaned?

392
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:36,933
窗戶是開著的
The window was open.

393
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:38,512
那倒是非常方便
That's very convenient.

394
00:15:39,754 --> 00:15:41,121
請記錄
Let the record show

395
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:44,084
那真是非常方便
that that was very convenient.

396
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:49,664
完了  電視里演過的各種法律手段我們都用盡了
We're screwed. We've tried every legal maneuver

397
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:52,256
包括《法律與秩序》《波士頓法律》
we've ever seen on Law and Order, Boston Legal,

398
00:15:52,257 --> 00:15:53,622
還有《生活的真相》
even that episode of Facts of Life

399
00:15:53,623 --> 00:15:55,170
托蒂被種族歸納的那集
where Tootie got racially profiled.

400
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:56,780
那家伙根本就是在撒謊
That guy is totally lying.

401
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:58,619
我都不知道該叫還是哭了
I don't know whether to scream or cry.

402
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:00,003
有了
That's it.

403
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:08,700
你個騙子  倫諾克斯
You're a liar, Lennox,

404
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,464
我要讓你
and I am gonna

405
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:12,380
從主要證人淪落為
bust you down from star witness to loser

406
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:14,273
只能租《證人》看的慫貨
who rents the movie Witness.

407
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:19,040
你怎么能把一個無辜的人送入監獄
How can you send an innocent man to jail?

408
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,192
他身材瘦弱
He has a slight frame

409
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:21,069
相貌清秀
and delicate features,

410
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,734
當個內衣模特倒是非常合適
and that's great for an underwear model,

411
00:16:22,735 --> 00:16:24,404
但當囚犯就太糟糕了
but it is horrible for a prisoner.

412
00:16:24,405 --> 00:16:25,462
等等
Wait a minute.

413
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:27,067
我快瘋了
It's been driving me crazy.

414
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:29,012
我就覺得這場面有點熟悉
I knew I recognized you guys from somewhere.

415
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:31,169
我見過你們對一個交通女警耍這伎倆
I saw you work this routine on a meter maid.

416
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:33,959
老娘就讓你從一個
I will have you busted down from meter maid

417
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,365
交通女警變成一個家庭女傭
to regular maid, and trust me,

418
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:38,325
我可告訴你  野餐都用不起桌布
that is a picnic without a blanket.

419
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:40,807
糟了  這招不管用
Oh, crap, this isn't gonna work.

420
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:42,509
他知道"紅臉警 白臉警"這招了
He knows about "Bad cop, sad cop."

421
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,438
怎么這么長時間
What's taking so long?

422
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,133
很滑啊
Oh, it's really slippery.

423
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:50,848
我試試...
Oh, here, maybe if I try to...

424
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:54,535
我無法呼吸了
Ah, I can't breathe!

425
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,604
我不能呼吸了
I can't breathe!

426
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:59,217
線纜把他的脖子纏住了
The cord is wrapped around his neck!

427
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,242
我們得立馬把他拉出來
We got to get him out of there right away!

428
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,157
塞布麗娜  用力推  用盡全力去推
Sabrina, push, push with all your might!

429
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:06,671
你可以的  用力點
You can do it! Harder!

430
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:10,065
天哪  不敢相信你們這群白癡會認為這樣管用
God, I can't believe you idiots thought this would work!

431
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:13,655
塞布麗娜  有時候我覺得你忘了我是你老板
Sabrina, sometimes I think you forget I'm your boss.

432
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:17,065
媽咪  救命
Mama, help us.

433
00:17:17,357 --> 00:17:18,755
我得采取點措施
I have to do something.

434
00:17:31,729 --> 00:17:33,439
沒事了  沒事了
It's okay, it's okay.

435
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,140
你沒事了  媽咪在呢
You're okay; Mommy's got you.

436
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,653
是個男孩
It's a boy!

437
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:54,091
如果你同意
So, if you'll agree

438
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:55,689
免除這些罰單
to dismiss all these tickets,

439
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,161
我們一定可以讓我們的當事人認罪
we can definitely get our client to plead guilty.

440
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,809
一般來說  認罪協議不能幫被告律師
Traditionally, plea deals do not help the defendant's lawyers

441
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,068
免于支付停車罰款
avoid paying parking fines.

442
00:18:04,148 --> 00:18:05,256
我知道了
I got it!

443
00:18:05,344 --> 00:18:06,281
我們拒絕協議
We reject the deal.

444
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:07,542
我并沒有提出協議
I offered no deal.

445
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:09,564
賈妮斯  記錄下來
Janice, get it on the record

446
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:12,136
我并沒有向任何人提出協議
that I did not offer anyone a deal.

447
00:18:15,604 --> 00:18:18,002
根據你之前的證詞
According to your previous testimony,

448
00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:21,332
你看到我的當事人
when exactly did you see my client

449
00:18:21,873 --> 00:18:25,472
在松樹街偷你電動車的具體時間是什么
stealing your moped on Pine Street?

450
00:18:25,473 --> 00:18:27,498
5月19日下午五點
May 19th, 5:00 p.m.

451
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:29,775
那你的證詞里是否也曾說過
And is it also your testimony

452
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:34,195
你看到我德高望重的律師丈夫和我本人
that you saw my esteemed lawyer husband and myself,

453
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,640
在法律界也是受人敬重的律師
also an esteemed attorney at law,

454
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,103
在榆木大道收到罰單
getting a ticket on Elmwood Avenue?

455
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:42,209
-是的  -那能請你為我讀一讀
- Yes. - Would you mind reading

456
00:18:42,357 --> 00:18:44,848
這張罰單上印著什么嗎
what's printed on this ticket for me?

457
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:50,484
5月19日下午五點
"May 19, 5:00 p.M."

458
00:18:51,224 --> 00:18:52,670
女士們先生們
Ladies and gentlemen...

459
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,837
一個人怎么可能
...how could one man

460
00:18:55,838 --> 00:18:58,370
在同一時間身處于相隔十英里的
be in two different places, ten miles apart from each other,

461
00:18:58,371 --> 00:18:59,749
兩個地方呢
at the exact same time?

462
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:01,316
是因為
Is it because,

463
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:03,410
我猜一下  他有月光寶盒嗎
I don't know, he has a time machine?

464
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,772
又或者他在撒謊
Or is it because he is a liar?

465
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:07,709
好了
Fine!

466
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,845
我承認
I admit it.

467
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,018
我撒謊了
I lied.

468
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:11,854
我沒看到他偷我的電動車
I didn't see him steal my moped.

469
00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:13,203
我那么說是因為
I just said it because

470
00:19:13,204 --> 00:19:16,238
那個狗娘養的睡了我的女朋友
that son of a bitch slept with my girlfriend.

471
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,358
案件駁回
Case dismissed.

472
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,294
這是我的臺詞
I'm supposed to say that.

473
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:28,416
你在哭呢
Oh, you're crying.

474
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,503
我沒想到這對你有這么重大的意義
I thought this wasn't that big of a deal for you.

475
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:34,870
我撒謊了
I lied.

476
00:19:36,428 --> 00:19:39,047
我說謊是因為有時候說謊比坦白容易
Sometimes I lie when it's easier than telling the truth.

477
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:41,807
我  我很抱歉  如果我太過分了的話 
I'm-I'm sorry if-if I went a little overboard.

478
00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:42,801
沒有
I'm not.

479
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:44,373
喜旺出生的時候
Neither of us was there

480
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:46,225
我們都不在身邊  但是
the first time Hope was born, and...

481
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:48,720
很奇怪的是
in a really weird way,

482
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:51,187
我覺得這對我們都是好事
I feel like it was good for all of us.

483
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:54,233
因為這次我們一起完成了
'Cause we did it together.

484
00:19:55,384 --> 00:19:56,822
像一個真正的家庭
Like a real family.

485
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:59,046
所以這算是個好主意嗎
So this was good idea?

486
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:02,021
不  這主意糟透了
No, it was a horrible idea.

487
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:04,177
但是很管用
But it worked.

488
00:20:05,603 --> 00:20:08,245
你這樣做  真是世界上最貼心的男人呢
And you are the sweetest man in the world for doing it.

489
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:10,594
喜旺的再出生給了我們
Hope's rebirth gave us something

490
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:11,868
都需要的東西
that we both needed.

491
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:14,139
我們一起做一些
The experience of doing something together

492
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,053
以前誰都沒做過的事
that neither of us had done before.

493
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,630
不止我們這樣
And we weren't the only ones.

494
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,458
你覺得我們現在該怎么處理這眼鏡
What do you think we should do with these now?

495
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:24,934
我想我們該扔了
I guess we get rid of them.

496
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:27,561
我們應該不會再假裝律師了
We're probably not gonna pretend to be lawyers again.

497
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,513
但戴眼鏡讓我覺得我是文化人
They just made me feel so smart.

498
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:33,530
不止是眼鏡的問題
Hey, it wasn't just the glasses.

499
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:34,726
你太棒了
You were amazing.

500
00:20:34,727 --> 00:20:36,829
你比職業律師還聰明
You outsmarted professional lawyers.

501
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,515
你拯救了一個無辜的人  讓他免入冤獄
You kept an innocent man from going to jail.

502
00:20:38,516 --> 00:20:39,675
不是我一個人的功勞
It wasn't just me.

503
00:20:40,242 --> 00:20:42,784
如果不是你想到"壞警察  可憐蛋"那招
If you hadn't thought of doing "Bad cop, sad cop,"

504
00:20:42,785 --> 00:20:44,934
亞倫根本不在場的事情就不會自己暴露了
then Aaron would've never blown his alibi.

505
00:20:47,332 --> 00:20:49,742
我相信我們本來是可以當律師的
You know, I bet we could've been lawyers,

506
00:20:49,753 --> 00:20:51,285
如果我們以前選擇不同的道路
if we'd done things differently.

507
00:20:51,286 --> 00:20:53,492
比如去上法學院啊
Like go to law school and college

508
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:54,533
讀完高中什么的
and finished high school.

509
00:20:54,534 --> 00:20:56,438
聽起來得花大力氣呢
That sounds like a lot of effort.

510
00:20:56,918 --> 00:20:58,445
那吊帶褲磨得我好疼啊
And those suspenders chafed.

511
00:20:58,446 --> 00:21:00,050
是啊  還有那些姿勢
Yeah, and all that posing...

512
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:02,001
我的嘴唇好疼
My lips hurt.

513
00:21:02,034 --> 00:21:03,468
我覺得我嘴撇得過頭了
I think I over-pouted.

514
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:06,293
是啊  很高興我退休前沒輸過一場官司
Yeah, I'm happy to retire having never lost a case.

515
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:07,424
是啊  我也是
Yeah, me, too.

516
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:10,924
但我覺得我要等到明早再扔掉眼鏡
But I think I'll wait till morning to throw these out.

517
00:21:11,013 --> 00:21:11,905
好主意
Good idea.

518
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,171
也許我們可以戴著眼鏡睡覺
Maybe if we sleep in 'em,

519
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:21,880
這樣會做聰明的夢
we'll have smart dreams.
