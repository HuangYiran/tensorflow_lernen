You're asking me to spy on a notorious spy killer

139
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,860
还要我假装密码专家
while pretending to be an expert in cryptography,

140
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,940
那个领域我一无所知
which I know nothing about.

141
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,090
雷丁顿坚持要你去
Reddington insists on you.

142
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,110
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,050
看看这些照片
Look at those pictures.

144
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,930
如果那条信息里有另一个名字
If there is a name in that message,

145
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,960
那份文件里就会再多一张脸
there's gonna be another face in that file.

146
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,910
那就是你的责任
That'll be on you.

147
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,840
我很快回来  拿一下我的包
I'll be back in a second. I just need to grab my purse.

148
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,710
我以为在台子上呢
I thought it was on the counter.

149
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,440
有人吗
Hello?

150
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,920
找到了吗
Hey. Did you find it?

151
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,920
找到了  不好意思  来了
Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm coming.

152
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,740
如果我做这个  有什么好处
Okay. Say I do this, what's in it for me?

153
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,050
看看你  还要谈条件
Look at you, camel trading like a Bedouin.

154
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,950
如果我帮你  我要有所回报
If I'm gonna help you, I want something in return.

155
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,890
比如
Such as?

156
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,260
真相  就这一次
The truth. Just once.

157
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,270
我想知道你为什么选我
I want to know why you chose me.

158
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,830
好吧  那我们得赶快走了
Well, then, we need to move quickly.

159
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,420
事情已经开始了
Things are already in play.

160
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,330
WDCJ
WDCJ --

161
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,950
是九公里外的一座小型广播站
a small radio station five miles from here.

162
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,320
那幢楼在六年前被一家
The building was purchased six years ago

163
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,430
为中国政府打掩护的公司买了
by a corporation fronting for the Chinese government.

164
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,500
不好意思  等一下
I'm sorry. Wait.

165
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,790
你是说吴京在利用广播站
You're telling us that Wu Jing is running a spy ring

166
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,440
进行间谍活动吗
out of a radio station?

167
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,950
我们会与吴京见面
We'll meet Wu Jing.

168
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,010
你来破译信息并将其传给你的人
You'll decode the message and transmit it to your team.

169
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,040
如果我破译了信息
If I decode the message,

170
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,500
这意味着中国人也会拿到
that means the Chinese get it, too.

171
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,470
就是这样  你和中国人
Exactly -- both you and the Chinese

172
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,070
都会知道这条信息
will know the name of the agent

173
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,580
所涉及的特工名字
for which the message was intended,

174
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,080
然后就是比速度了
and the race begins.

175
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,480
我们要救他  而中国人要杀掉他
We try to save him. The Chinese try to kill him.

176
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,230
-我们可以给他们个虚假信息  -不行
- We could give them a false message. - No.

177
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,950
这个可行  我们可以误导他们
That could work. We could send them in the wrong direction.

178
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,250
我说了不行
I said no.

179
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,200
中国人可能不知道这条信息是什么
The Chinese may not know what the message is,

180
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,530
但是他们肯定会分辨假信息
but they certainly know what it isn't.

181
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,980
要来就来真的  要不然就不做
We do it for real, or we don't do it at all.

182
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,600
计划不错  不过如我所言
Great plan, except, as I have said,

183
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,550
我对加密一窍不通
I know nothing about encryption.

184
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,520
你学东西很快
You're a very quick study.

185
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,070
我认识个人可以帮你
I have a guy who can help you with that.

186
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,250
信息会在一个像这样子的闪存里

187
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,090
你把它插进去

188
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,650
就像个魔盒了

189
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,270
中国人会把截获的信息通过这样的闪存
The Chinese will give you an intercepted message

190
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,080
交给你
on one of these.

191
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,720
把它插进去  它会提示你连接一个数据库
Insert it, and it will prompt you to connect a data locker.

192
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,700
李顺说它就像个魔盒
Shun Lee says it's like a magic box.

193
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,780
魔盒
A magic box?

194
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,150
所以你等一下把它插进去

195
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,620
数据库会自动解密信息
The data locker applies a key to the message.

196
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,500
这需要花一段时间
It'll take a moment,

197
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,830
不过解码后的信息会出现在你的笔记本上
but the decoded message will appear on your laptop.

198
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,450
那我怎么把信息提取出来
How do I get the message out?

199
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,370
你不用  电脑会帮你做
You don't. The computer does it for you.

200
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,150
你需要的就是一个卫星信号
All you need is a satellite connection.

201
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,100
如果你有问题你把这个插进去

202
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,050
这就是我自己做的

203
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,390
如果没有卫星信号  就用这个
If you don't have a satellite connection, use this.

204
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,250
这是一个远程镜像程序
It's a remote mirroring program.

205
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,040
可以让我们的技术员在外部控制系统
It'll give our tech on the outside control of the system.

206
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,660
没事的
It's gonna be okay.

207
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,330
我讲得怎么样

208
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,370
很棒  你的普通话太赞了
Great. You're rocking the Mandarin.

209
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,410
谢谢
Xie xie.

210
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,650
长官  还有三分钟就到会面时间了
Three minutes till the meeting, sir.

211
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,640
雷丁顿到底在哪  他迟到了
Where the hell is Reddington? He's late.

212
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,440
他会搞砸这事的
He's gonna blow this whole damn thing.

213
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,510
你抽烟吗
Do you smoke?

214
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,460
-不抽  -现在你抽了
- No. - Well, you do now.

215
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,860
或者至少你正在戒烟
Or at least you're trying to quit.

216
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,950
这是中情局全新的设备
This is C.I.A. equipment. It's brand-new.

217
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,270
看起来像尼古丁贴片
It looks like a nicotine patch,

218
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,610
但却是个非常敏感的发射器
but it's a very sensitive transmitter.

219
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,340
270米的传送范围  是塑料聚合物
It has a range of 300 yards, and it's a plastic polymer,

220
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,180
检验器验不出来
which means it won't show up if it gets wanded.

221
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,540
你要是错了怎么办
And if you're wrong?

222
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,570
我不会错
I'm not wrong.

223
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,700
他到底在哪里
Where the hell is he?

224
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,600
他应该一小时前就到
He was supposed to be here an hour --

225
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,960
我们还在等什么
What are we waiting for?

226
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,640
一号监视点  就位了吗
Surveillance one, are you in position?

227
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,060
收到  已经就位
Roger that. In position.

228
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,120
卫星信号良好  运行正常
Satellite feed up and running.

229
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:24,760
这边请
Right this way.

230
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,160
开始了
Here we go.

231
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,410
先生  抱歉  这是规定
Sorry, sir. Protocol.

232
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,290
女士请上前
Miss, please.

233
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,450
谢谢  先生请上前
Thank you. Sir?

234
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,110
国防高研计划局的8毫米跟踪芯片
DARPA tracking chip, 8-millimeter tag.

235
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,030
我去年三月被索马里海盗抓走了
I was taken by Somali pirates last March,

236
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,300
在船运集装箱里待了三个星期
spent three weeks in a shipping container.

237
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,950
头两个星期噩梦一般
The first two were a nightmare.

238
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,300
第三个星期还挺不错的
The third one was actually quite pleasant.

239
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,360
虽然如此  不会再来一次了
Even so, that won't happen again.

240
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,570
你要是有干净的剃须刀片和吗啡
If you have a clean razor blade and some morphine,

241
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,860
我可以拿掉
I'll remove it.

242
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,080
没必要  但你的同事
That won't be necessary, but I am going to need

243
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,990
要接受指纹扫描
a biometric print scan from your associate.

244
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,210
-她是和我一起的  -明白
- She's with me. - Understood.

245
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,840
但我收到指示要扫描任何新访客
But my orders are to scan any new visitors.

246
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,640
是和什么数据库进行比对的
What database is this being run against?

247
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,600
所有的数据库
All of them.

248
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,540
{\pos(236,155)}指纹分析中

249
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:54,900
发生了什么事
What's happening?

250
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,260
他们在查她的指纹
They are running her prints.

251
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,010
-能拦截吗  -不知道
- Can you intercept them? - I don't know.

252
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,230
原来你们喜欢灰色
So, you went with the gray?

253
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,830
好了
Okay.

254
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,410
消除了
Vanish.

255
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,480
{\pos(212,130)}找不到匹配记录

256
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,660
跟我来
Follow me.

257
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,020
如你所见  我们做了些改进
As you can see, we've made some improvements.

258
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,320
你那追踪芯片到里面就失效了
Oh, your DARPA chip won't work where you're going.

259
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,570
到了后吴京会给你们解释
Wu Jing will explain when you get there.

260
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,900
到哪里
Get where?

261
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,470
{\pos(267,194)}信号丢失

262
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,080
发生了什么
What the hell just happened?

263
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,770
{\pos(267,197)}信号丢失

264
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,670
-没信号了  -不可能就这样消失了
- We lost them. - We can't just lose them.

265
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,150
出了什么问题
What happened to our signal?

266
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,520
他们好像在下降
They seem to be descending,

267
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,660
这没道理啊
which doesn't make any sense.

268
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,570
建筑图纸上没有地下空间
The blueprints don't show any underground space.

269
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,120
把信号找回来
Get that signal back.

270
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,460
你觉得我们会下降多深
How far down do you think we're going?

271
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,490
足够深
Far enough.

272
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,720
我的朋友
My friend.

273
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,760
不必假惺惺的  吴京  你一个朋友都没有
Don't be cheeky, Wu Jing. You don't have any friends.

274
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,020
这是我的同事
My associate.

275
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,240
吉文斯女士
Ms. Givins.

276
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,300
罗宾斯教授只和顶尖人才合作
Professor Robins only works with the best.

277
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,130
他是个了不起的老师
Oh, he was an amazing teacher.

278
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,490
听说他去世了我很遗憾
I was so sorry to hear that he passed away.

279
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,670
你这里做了些改进
You've made some changes.

280
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,180
-我们不得不加强安保  -我能想象
- We had to increase security. - I can imagine --

281
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,520
过去一年半里有四个美国特工被杀
Four American agents killed in the past year and a half.

282
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,680
你一定很忙
You've been busy.

283
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,360
我猜这里屏蔽了一切
I presume nothing gets in or out,

284
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,840
无论是无线电还是卫星传送
no radio or satellite transmissions.

285
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,030
只能凭信任进出
Nothing but trust.

286
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,630
请别介意
Please don't take offense.

287
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,790
这是为了避免被美国人侦听
I can't risk American surveillance.

288
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,520
只有我们的系统通过硬接线与外界连接
Only our systems are hard-wired to the outside world.

289
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,570
开始工作吧
Let's get to work.

290
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,870
我曾在一个地洞里有过很糟糕的经历
I once had a bad experience in a deep hole in the ground.

291
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,750
金隼  新的高级译码员
Jin Sun, my new senior cryptographer.

292
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,130
我们本以为是标准RSA加密算法
We expected standard RSA encryption,

293
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,960
但这个更复杂
but this was something stronger.

294
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,490
政府在实验
The government's been experimenting

295
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,260
更好的因子分解算法
with better factoring algorithms.

296
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,100
淘汰RSA算法是早晚的事
It's only a matter of time before RSA's obsolete.

297
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,870
你说得对
You're right. It is.

298
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,330
我需要一点时间安装设备
I'll just need a few moments to set up my equipment.

299
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,090
这边请
This way.

300
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,260
他们在弄  但还没结果
They're trying, but still nothing.

301
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,060
可能是中国人干扰了我们的信号
Either the Chinese are scrambling our signals,

302
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,530
{\an8}{\pos(227,204)}信号丢失

303
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,710
或者莉斯和红魔超出了追踪范围
or Liz and Red are out of range.

304
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,600
我记得你的设备追踪范围是270米
I thought your equipment had a range of 300 yards.

305
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,110
是的  但也许他们在大楼下
It does, but maybe they've built a bunker

306
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,410
挖了个地下室
that deep under the building.

307
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,790
{\pos(217,218)}信号丢失

308
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,400
我们被耍了
We're getting played.

309
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,540
红魔和莉兹是故意让信号失灵的
That signal went dark because Red and Liz wanted it to.

310
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,720
不太可能
That's not likely.

311
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,900
我们有多少时间找出确切原因
How long can we wait to find out?

312
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,640
也许是他们有危险呢
Is it possible they could be in danger?

313
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,340
所以我们更加不能这么等下去
That's another reason not to wait.

314
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,780
让所有突击小组待命
Keep all insertion teams on standby.

315
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,460
五分钟后还没有基恩探员的消息就冲进去
If we don't hear from Agent Keen in five minutes, we're going in.

316
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,090
准备好了吗
We ready yet?

317
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,810
{\an8}需要卫星信号

318
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,210
你常回家吗  金隼
Do you get home much, Jin Sun?

319
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,350
两年没回去了
Not for two years.

320
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,890
那可真不容易  要是我肯定会很痛苦
Oh, that must be hard. It certainly would be for me.

321
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,430
我连手机都没有
I don't even have a phone.

322
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,670
我坚持亲自传递一切消息
I insist on delivering all of my messages in person.

323
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,160
{\an8}需要卫星信号
没时间人工传递
探员会被杀害

324
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,470
你的家乡在哪个省
What province are you from?

325
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,290
云南省
From Yunnan.

326
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,170
那可是个美丽的地方
Oh, beautiful part of the country.

327
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,480
我之前在昆明市郊的一个庙里
I spent a month in silent meditation

328
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,450
花了一个月的时间冥想
at a monastery just outside of Kunming.

329
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,040
{\an8}需要卫星信号
没时间人工传递
探员会被杀害
必须用金的电脑
怎么办

330
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,890
那真是一次很好的
It was a wonderful escape

331
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,480
逃离尘世的体验
from the distractions of everyday life.

332
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,480
我都没法想象呆在这下面会有多让人心烦
I can't imagine the distractions one might encounter down here.

333
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,510
你觉得呢
Can you?

334
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,050
是啊  无法想象
No. I can't.

335
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,430
{\an8}必须用金的电脑
怎么办
没错  分散他们的注意力

336
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,020
很好
Excellent.

337
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,600
我觉得差不多准备好了  这应该很有意思
I think we're almost ready. This should be fun.

338
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,950
那是什么
What the hell is that?

339
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,990
我发誓  如果你让我再碰到跟上次
I swear, if I run into the same trouble

340
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,860
在香港一样的状况
I had with you in Hong Kong...

341
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,770
我们认识这么多年了
In all the years you and I have known each other,

342
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,510
我可从来没让你陷入这样的境地
I've never put you in a position like this.

343
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,610
你知道我怎么做生意的
You know how I conduct my business.

344
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,220
我可不想惹上这些麻烦
I don't need this kind of crap.

345
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,560
你向我保证这里肯定安全
You assured me this place was secure.

346
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,470
-是很安全 -那是什么
- It is. - Then what the hell is that?!

347
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,510
那辆厢式货车
That van.

348
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,840
我们到的时候它就在那里了  现在还在
It was there when we arrived, and it's still there.

349
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,830
肯定是联邦调查局
That is the FBI.

350
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,320
弄了那么多扫描检查
With all the scans and wands

351
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,030
还建了这个连接到中土世界的电梯
and this elevator you've built that goes down to middle earth,

352
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,190
你们居然没去检查一下
and you don't even bother to sweep the street

353
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,830
这周边的街道  真是太扯了
around your building? This is nonsense.

354
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,130
-冷静点  朋友  -你被监视了
- Calm down, old friend. - You're under surveillance!

355
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,540
如果联调局在外边  那也是你引来的
If the FBI was outside, it's because you led them here.

356
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,850
这20年我在全球各地
I've been moving comfortably through the world

357
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,160
来去自如  无影无踪
for the past 20 years without a trace.

358
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,230
难道现在几个不入流的间谍杀手
And now some two-bit spy killer

359
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,310
就想置我和我的事业于险境吗
is gonna put my life and business in jeopardy?

360
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,730
外面那辆面包车

361
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,640
看看怎么回事

362
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,320
有情况  所有人注意
We have activity. Everybody, heads up.

363
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,140
被发现了  你两点钟方向  15秒内撤离
We're made. Your 2 o'clock. Break it down. 15 seconds.

364
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,770
该走了  收起来
We got to go. Pack it up.

365
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,690
你
You!

366
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,070
-我们暴露了  -有可能
- They know we're here. - Maybe,

367
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,000
也有可能只是
or maybe the van's just

368
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,870
这货车停太久引起他们的警觉了
been there too long and they're being careful.

369
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,040
我不喜欢这样  等我信号就进去
I don't like it. We're going in on my signal.

370
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,890
难以置信
Unbelievable.

371
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,840
看到没  什么都没有
You see? Nothing.

372
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,070
可以继续了吗
Now...can we continue?

373
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,690
你真该为自己感到羞耻
You should be ashamed of yourself.

374
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,400
置我和吉文斯女士于险境  太不专业了
To put Ms. Givins and I at risk, it's unprofessional.

375
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,470
-我不能忍了  -够了
- I've reached my limit. - Enough!

376
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,410
什么
What?

377
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,840
好吧  好吧  对不起
Okay. Okay. You know, I'm sorry.

378
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,540
我今天不太顺
I've had a rough day.

379
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,390
难以置信
Unbelievable.

380
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,080
可以开始了吗
Should we do this?

381
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,420
出发  1分钟后到达
Let's roll. E.T.A. -- one minute.

382
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,740
信息在这里面
The message.

383
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,250
你不怀念那些
Don't you miss the good old days

384
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,870
用公用电话和险中逃生的美好时光吗
with the pay phones and the brush pasts?

385
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,000
还剩30秒
30 seconds out.

386
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,680
等等  我收到了一些东西
Wait. I've got something.

387
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,330
她在用远程镜像程序
She's using the remote mirroring program.

388
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,350
米拉的联系人给她的
Meera's contact gave her.

389
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,340
等等  这不是她的电脑
Uh, hang on. This isn't her computer.

390
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,270
看起来是个中文系统
It looks like one of the Chinese systems.

391
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,710
有中情局的信息吗
Can you see the C.I.A. message?

392
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,600
是的  长官  还不止那些  正在下载
Yes, sir, and a lot more than that. Downloading now.

393
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,250
-还剩10秒  -所有单位  撤退
- 10 seconds out. - Okay, all units, stand down.

394
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,700
重复  撤退
I repeat, stand down.

395
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,400
重复  所有单位  撤退
I repeat, all units stand down.

396
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,170
撤退中
Standing down.

397
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,920
这是你下一个目标  第五个要干掉的人
There's your next target -- kill number five.

398
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,710
亨利·周
Henry Cho.

399
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,990
收到信息了  目标是亨利·周
We have the message. The target is Henry Cho.

400
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,960
好  抓紧时间
All right. The clock is ticking.

401
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,830
把这人的所有资料都找出来
I want everything we can find on this guy.

402
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,590
信息是从中情局服务器
This was sent from a C.I.A. server,

403
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,290
发到南京古南都饭店的服务器的
delivered to a server at the Nanjing Grand Hotel.

404
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:51,480
周先生  为什么中情局要往你住的酒店
So, Mr. Cho, why is the C.I.A. sending you secret messages

405
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,670
发秘密信息呢
at your hotel?

406
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,530
等等  这个人不是探员
Hold on. This guy's not an agent.

407
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,300
他是中美混血  一名建筑师
He's Chinese-American, an architect.

408
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,750
建筑师
An architect?

409
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,130
那他怎么和中情局扯上关系的
Then why the hell is he talking to the C.I.A.?

410
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,860
因为我们找他帮忙
Because we asked for his help.

411
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,730
亨利·周在中库建筑公司工作
Henry Cho works for Zhongku Construction.

412
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,770
不是在中国  是在华盛顿特区
Not in China, here in D.C.

413
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,930
中库  那可是家很大的建筑公司
Zhongku -- they're a huge construction company.

414
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,860
{\pos(100,20)}美国司法部  联邦调查局

415
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,470
他们设计的建筑遍布世界各地
They design buildings all over the world.

416
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,970
他的出入境档案显示他在过去十个月中
His immigration file says he's been to the company headquarters

417
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,120
六次前往公司总部
6 times in the last 10 months.

418
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,470
那就是中情局接触他的原因
That's why the C.I.A. reached out to him.

419
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,090
中库正在为上海设计一座新的政府大楼

420
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,610
我们请亨利利用他的权限帮我们拿到图纸
We asked Henry to use his access to get us the plans.

421
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,880
多亏他  我们窃听了整幢军委大楼
Thanks to him, our ops bugged the entire city military commission.

422
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,160
咱们把话说明白
Let me get this straight.

423
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,710
这个人不是训练有素的特工
This guy's not a trained operative.

424
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,770
他只是一名  承包商
He's just a... contractor?

425
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,180
一个平民
A civilian.

426
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,860
他现在在哪里
Where is he now?

427
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,670
就在这里
Here.

428
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,210
入境档案显示他三天之前离开中国

429
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,480
{\an8}飞行记录

00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,070
乘机抵达杜勒斯机场

431
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,040
谢谢你  阿兰姆  不用谢
Thank you, Aram. You're welcome.

432
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,000
找到他
Go get him.

433
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,100
-中库建筑公司  -请转亨利·周
- Zhongku Construction. - Henry Cho, please.

434
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,610
我需要立刻和他通话  是非常重要的事情
It's very important that I speak to him immediately.

435
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,570
他的兄弟  小平  出了车祸
His brother, Xiaoping, has been in a car accident.

436
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,590
他和他的儿子在我们费尔围的楼那边
He's at our Fairview Property with his son.

437
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,280
我可以试试给他打电话
I can try to call him --

438
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,930
找到姓周的  干掉他

439
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,070
他不接电话
There's no answer on his cell.

440
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,050
给公司打电话  问问他在哪
Call the company. Find out where he is.

441
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,800
我的朋友  多少感谢都不够
My friend, I can't thank you enough.

442
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,720
这些就够了
This is all the thanks I require.

443
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,970
拿上你的东西  是时候离开了
Get your things. It's time to go.

444
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,820
别管了
Leave it.

445
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,510
封锁出入口
Lock it down.

446
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,270
站住
Stop!

447
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,390
你是对的
You were right.

448
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,250
也许外面是联调局的人
Maybe that was the F.B.I. outside.

449
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,270
事实上  也许他们不止在外面
In fact, maybe they're not just outside.

450
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,190
也许他们就在这间屋子里
Maybe they're right here in this room.

451
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,290
要指控别人之前  先自己想清楚
Think hard before you accuse anybody of anything.

452
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,110
几分钟之前
A few minutes ago,

453
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:10,630
有人在这里连上了联调局的服务器
contact was made from this room to an FBI server.

454
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,400
我付出如此努力劫来的信息
A message I worked so hard to intercept

455
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,280
被传送给了美国人
was sent to the Americans.

456
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,880
我的直觉告诉我是她干的
Well, all my instincts said it was her.

457
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,000
我很相信我的直觉
I trust my instincts.

458
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,610
你很聪明
You're smart.

459
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,790
干这事的人很聪明
The one responsible was smart,

460
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,130
但是我们的系统更聪明
but our systems are smarter.

461
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:36,440
任何与政府服务器的连接都会被标记以供检查
Any contact with a government server is flagged for review.

462
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,370
所以
So...

463
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,070
我知道是谁背叛了我们
I know who betrayed us.

464
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,730
他不在办公室
He's not at the office.

465
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,900
他跟一个客户在费尔围和华莱士街交口的楼里
He's with a client at a property at Fairview and Wallace.

466
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:58,910
再给他打一遍
Try him again.

467
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,140
这里  会有几扇窗
So, over here, they're gonna make some windows.

468
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,830
外面这里
And out here...

469
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,600
会是个露台
there's gonna be a balcony

470
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,500
露台会横跨整座楼
that runs the length of the whole build--

471
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,650
-你说过要吃冰激凌的  -好的
- You said we were gonna get ice cream. - Okay.

472
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,760
我先给你看点别的东西
Let me just show you something else first.

473
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,730
把他拉起来
Get him up.

474
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,900
-我还以为你很忠心呢  -我不明白
- I thought you were loyal to us. - I don't understand.

475
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,290
信息是从你的系统传出去的  金隼
The message was sent from your system, Jin Sun.

476
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,640
这  这不可能
T-that's not possible.

477
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,500
不可能
That's not possible.

478
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,800
就是如此  而且不止是那信息
It is, and not just one message.

479
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,770
你把所有东西都给他们了
You gave them everything,

480
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,100
包括我们研究了几个月的文件
files we've worked on for months!

481
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,590
别人都没有权限
Nobody else had access.

482
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,500
我们得阻止他们
We have to do something.

483
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:42,870
安静
Quiet.

484
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,920
我们不能让他们这么干
We can't just let them do this.

485
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,200
你背叛了我

486
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,000
背叛了国家

487
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,880
把秘密卖给美国人

488
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,320
你不觉得害臊吗

489
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,330
你
You --

490
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,150
尽管这场面挺有意思的
As entertaining as all this has been,

491
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,350
但我们真的得走了
we really do need to leave now.

492
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,400
联调局马上就会来找你们了
The next sound you hear is gonna be the FBI knocking on your door,

493
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,260
而我  决不能留在这里
and I, for one, am not gonna be here.

494
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,550
吴京  看着我
Wu Jing! Look at me!

495
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,170
你杀了我的人
You don't kill one of my people.

496
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,530
现在我也要杀一个你的人
Now I have to kill one of yours.

497
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,770
从他发送消息的那一刻起
The moment he sent that message,

498
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,390
他对你就没用了
he became worthless to you.

499
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,100
你会再揍他二十分钟
You would have beaten him for another 20 minutes

500
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,720
然后亲手杀了他
and then killed him yourself.

501
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,140
但如果我让你杀死我的人
But if I let you kill a contractor of mine,

502
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,960
以后就没人会信任我了
I'll lose the trust of all my others,

503
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,690
也就没生意好做了
and that's just bad business.

504
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:18,400
所以如果你要杀她  最好把我也杀了
So if you kill her, you better kill me.

505
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,050
否则我就要杀了你
Or I'm going to kill you.

506
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,450
你雇我干活  我干完了
You hired me to do a job. It's done.

507
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,770
现在离开这吧
Now let's get out of here.

508
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,570
跟我来
Follow me.

509
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,740
还有一条出路
I have another way out.

510
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,990
我们去吃冰激凌  好吗
Let's go get you some ice cream, all right?

511
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,780
好
Okay.

512
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:48,980
喂
Hello?

513
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,400
周先生  我是中情局的米拉·马丽科特工
Mr. Cho, this is Agent Meera Malik with the C.I.A.

514
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,040
中情局  我不明白
C.I.A.? I don't understand.

515
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,510
你们不该打我这个电话的
You're not supposed to be calling me on this line.

516
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,110
听我说  你现在有危险
Listen to me. You are in danger.

517
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,590
听清了吗  中国人知道你名字了
Can you hear me? The Chinese have your name.

518
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,200
有人往你那里去了
There are men on their way to your location.

519
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,840
-我们在12层  -待在那儿别动
- We're on the 12th floor. - Stay where you are.

520
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,790
我们来救你
We're coming to get you.

521
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,490
躲好  我们很快就到
Stay hidden. We're just minutes out.

522
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,820
爸爸
Dad?

523
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,180
过来  过来  我们走
Come here. Come here. Let's go.

524
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,190
我在这苦心经营了三年
I've been building this place for three years,

525
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,560
现在却毁于一旦
and now my operation is burned.

526
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,090
那就再弄一个
So build another.

527
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,160
长官  找到他们了
Sir, I've got them.

528
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,860
红魔脖子里的芯片刚刚上线
The microchip in Red's neck just came online

529
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,590
还有我们放在基恩探员身上的窃听器
and the bug we put on Agent Keen.

530
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,220
他们离开了那幢楼  正在丹佛斯路向西行驶
They're out of the building, moving west on Danforth.

531
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,510
他们要去哪里
Where the hell are they going?

532
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,870
派特工拦截他们
Just send agents to intercept them.

533
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,040
藏好  藏好
Get underneath. Get underneath.

534
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,860
听我说
Listen. Listen.

535
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,690
别动  知道吗
Don't move, all right?

536
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,290
千万别动
Just don't move.

537
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,700
把手放好
No, put your hand in.

538
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,950
喂  回来

539
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,580
已经没有机会走了

540
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:39,870
不
No!

541
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,950
住手  爸爸
Stop! Dad!

542
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,980
爸爸  爸爸
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

543
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,960
放开他  放开我儿子
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Let him go! Let my son go!

544
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,600
拜托了  放了我儿子
Please! Please! Just let my son go! Please!

545
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,460
没事的  没事的  我什么都愿意做
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. I'll do anything.

546
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,370
放了他吧  不会有事的
Just let him go. It's gonna be all right.

547
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:08,140
-不会有事的  我保证  -爸爸
- It's gonna be all right. I promise. I promise. - Dad!

548
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,960
雷斯勒  这边搞定了
Ressler, clear!

549
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,540
雷斯勒  没事吧
Ressler, clear?

550
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,600
我没事  谢谢
I'm good. Thanks.

551
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,270
谢谢你
Thank you.

00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,630
谢谢你为我们所做的一切
Thank you for all you've done for us.

553
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,910
我可以带大家离开这个国家
I can get us out of the country.

554
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,140
那真是太好了
That's very kind,

555
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,620
但我确信我们可以自己应付
but I'm sure we can muddle through on our own.

556
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,100
找个阴凉处停车就好
Anywhere in the shade up here would be fine.

557
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,120
恐怕会让你失望了
I fear I've disappointed you.

558
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,910
我们说好的是
The deal was for us

559
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:21,730
抓到黑名单上的罪犯
to actually catch the criminals on the blacklist,

560
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,540
而现在吴京已经差不多半只脚踏进北京了
and now Wu Jing is as good as halfway to Beijing.

561
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,930
我看未必
I don't think so.

562
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,510
-没事吧  -没事
- Is everything okay? - We're fine.

563
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,560
快  快  举起手来
Move! Move! Let me see your hands!

564
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,410
下车  下车  下车
Get out! Get out! Get out!

565
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,920
-靠在车上  -拦截成功
- Up on the car! - The package is secure.

566
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,320
嫌犯已被扣押
Suspect in custody now.

567
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,120
璐丽跟我一起
Luli can stay with me.

568
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,320
邓比会载你去你想去的地方
Dembe will take you wherever you need to go.

569
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,490
你没必要杀他
You didn't have to kill him.

570
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,500
为了确保你的生命安全
I believe I will always do

571
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,700
不管什么事  我都会义无反顾去做的
whatever I feel I have to do to keep you alive.

572
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,850
我该做的都已经做了  现在该你了
I held up my end of the deal. Now it's your turn.

573
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,250
你还没告诉我答案
You owe me an answer.

574
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,220
问题是什么
What's the question?

575
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,800
为什么是我
Why me?

576
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,790
因为你父亲
Because of your father.

577
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,630
什么意思
What does that mean?

578
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,220
你认识我父亲吗
Did you know my father?

579
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,870
你们俩在哪见过面吗
Have the two of you met somehow?

580
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,740
我希望答案可以像问题那样简单
I wish the answer were as simple as the question seems.

581
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,890
但事实上  你的问题同样不简单
But the truth is, the question isn't simple, either.

582
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,160
我能体会你的沮丧
I share your frustration.

583
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,660
你搞得咱俩一样似的  你错了
You act like we're the same. You're wrong.

584
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,680
我有我的生活  有人关心我
I have a life, people who care about me.

585
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,420
可是你  这就是你的全部
But you... This is all you have.

586
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,080
我有你
I have you.

587
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,960
你还好吗
You okay?

588
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,330
凑合吧
I'll live.

589
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,750
听着  我只是想说
Look, I just wanted to say, uh...

590
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,570
也许我以前对你有一些质疑
Maybe I've had some doubts about you.

591
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,890
而且我也没把这些想法隐藏起来
Maybe I haven't done the best job of keeping them to myself,

592
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:54,040
但你今天做得真的很棒
but what you did today was good work.

593
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,280
谢谢
Thanks.

594
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,890
要不是你传出的那条消息
If you didn't get that message out when you did,

595
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,530
亨利·周肯定活不了
Henry Cho wouldn't be alive.

596
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,000
不管在里边发生了什么事
Whatever else went down in there,

597
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,620
你都不该自责
you should feel good about that.
