00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,300
他来这里干什么
Why is he here?

26
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,190
他的家人不是都在芝加哥嘛
I mean, uh, his family's all in Chicago.

27
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,230
他没地方去
He had no place to go.

28
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,360
所以你就邀请他来参加家庭橄榄球赛吗
So you invited him to a family football game?

29
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,480
对啊
Yeah.

30
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,170
我明白你们共度了难关  增进了感情
Oh. Look, I understand you guys had a bonding moment,

31
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,070
但是你别忘了  这个男人
but you're aware that that's the guy

32
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,730
向州长打了你的小报告
that ratted you out to the governor?

33
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:14,420
友情提醒一下
I'm just reminding you.

34
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,360
今天可是感恩节
I mean, it's Thanksgiving, okay?

35
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,650
就当我心胸宽广吧
I mean, call me the bigger man.

36
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,250
-他们在等你呢  -快来  集合了
- They're waiting for you. - Come on, let's huddle!

37
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,510
来吧  兄弟  集合了
Come on, guys. Let's bring it in. Huddle, huddle!

38
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,300
42比35  我们领先
42-35, our favor.

39
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,590
只要保持住  我们就赢定了
Listen, we hold 'em here, the game's ours. All right?

40
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,500
行  压制住他们  比赛就是我们的
All right, now we got 'em. This is the play.

41
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,710
丹尼  你在我右边待命  随时准备
Danny, I want you to line up on my right, run a post,

42
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,960
你们两个在我左右  到时候从两边...
you two line up on either side of me. I want you to cross...

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,280
把球给我就行  我来负责得分
Just-Just give me the ball. I'll get it into the end zone.

44
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,630
你菊花里要是自带喷气机
The only way you're getting the ball

45
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,620
我们才考虑把球传给你
is if you got a jet pack up your culo, okay?

46
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,610
数三声一起说守住  一二三
On three-- defense! One, two, three.

47
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,660
-守住  -好嘞  -出发
- Defense! - All right! - Let's go!

48
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,410
来吧  秒杀他们
Here we go, take it down.

49
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,540
来吧  弱鸡六人组
Let's go. Come on. Easy six!

50
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,000
放心吧
Man, I got you.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,390
开始吧  准备好了吗
Here we go. Here we go. Ready?

52
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,190
传球给我
Give me the ball.

53
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,530
-准备  开球  -游戏开始
- Set... hut! - Here we go!

54
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,740
不  别是威廉姆斯  不...
No! Not Williams. No...

55
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,160
听我说  我们要团结起来
All-State QB. We're all tied up.

56
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,120
再触地得分一次就赢了
Next touchdown wins.

57
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,450
等一下  等等
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

58
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,820
提醒
上午9:45  放火鸡进烤箱

59
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,050
-不行  我得走了  -去哪里
- That's it I gotta go. - Whoa, whoa, go where?

60
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,300
去哪里  你在说什么
Go where? What are you talking about?

61
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,790
我得去  去把火鸡放进烤箱里
I gotta, I gotta put the turkey in the oven.

62
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,810

Oh-oh! What are you doing? What are you doing?

63
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,160
你今天还想不想吃了
You want to eat today or what?

64
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,930
让玛丽把那玩意放进那东西里就行
Oh! Have Mary put the thing in the thing.

65
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,480
-还用你亲自去啊  -玛丽是打下手的
- What are you doing? - Mary's the prep cook.

66
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,570
你们都盯着我干什么
What are you all looking at me for?

67
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,540
打下手的厨师不能负责填充火鸡  明白吗
The prep cook doesn't get to stuff the turkey, okay?

68
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,700
-这是我的任务  -你来真的啊
- This is my operation. - Oh, come on, are you serious?

69
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,800
难以置信  我们还在打比赛呢
This is unbelievable. We got a game here.

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,140
我十分钟后就回来
I'll be back in ten minutes!

71
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,680
麦格瑞特家

72
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,680
麦格瑞特家

73
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,900
怎么回事
What the hell?

74
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,310
还没解冻
It didn't thaw.

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,990
什么
What?!

76
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,310
我知道  我知道
I know, I know.

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,110
-你昨晚从冰箱里拿出来了吗  -拿了
- Did you take it out of the freezer last night? - Yeah.

78
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,780
然后放进冷水里了吗
And you put it in cold water?

79
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,460
当然啦
Yeah. For sure.

80
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,910
你放进冷水里没有
Did you put it in cold water?

81
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,310
没有
No.

82
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,320
我忘记了
No, I-I completely forgot.

83
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,200
别生我气  别生气
Please don't be mad. Please.

84
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,610
你知道吗  我让你来打下手
You know what? I knew something like this

85
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,060
就知道一定会出这种状况
would happen if I made you my prep cook.

86
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,510
你要是早就知道
Well, then why'd you make me your prep cook

87
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,720
为什么还要让我帮忙
if you knew this was gonna happen?

88
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,750
你逼我的啊
You forced me to make you my prep cook.

89
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,090
你说自己光负责搞定土豆泥不过瘾
You told me that mashing potatoes wasn't enough responsibility.

90
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,260
想多干点事
You wanted more responsibility.

91
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,380
所以我就让你打下手了
And I made you my prep cook.

92
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,090
你说得对
You're right.

93
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,960
好吧  我很抱歉
Okay, but listen. I'm sorry.

94
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,900
琼昨晚太能闹腾了
Joan was so fussy last night.

95
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,120
一直都不肯睡觉
I couldn't-I couldn't get her down.

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,090
我向你道歉
And I apologize.

97
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,480
马上就来
Yes, I'm coming!

98
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,000
帮我个忙
Okay, uh, do me a favor.

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,670
打开烤箱  先预热
Put the oven on, get the sides started.

100
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,320
我再想办法吧
And I'll-I'll figure something out.

101
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,530
感恩节快乐
Happy Thanksgiving!

102
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,610

Aunt Deb?

103
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,340
快来抱一抱
Come here and give me a hug.

104
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,560
你怎么会来这里
What are you doing here?

105
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,710
都这么多年没见你了
Well, it's been years since I've seen you,

106
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,840
所以我就想来看看你
and I figured it's high time i paid you a visit.

107
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,770
你真漂亮
You look fantastic.

110
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,930
你看到什么了
What do you got?

111
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,720
-我看到这里有白发了哦  -是啊
- I see a little little gray fleck right there. - Oh, yeah,

112
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,210
-是有些  喜欢吗  -还不赖
- a little bit. You like that? - Yeah, yeah, I like it.

113
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,350
让你看起来非常成熟卓越
I think it makes you look very distinguished.

114
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,810
-谢谢  -没什么
- Thank you very much. - Yeah.

115
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,790
不过文身就不怎么样了
The tattoos not so much.

116
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,070
黛比姑妈
Aunt Deb?

117
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,410
是玛丽和她的小宝宝
Oh! It's Mary and her little lamb.

118
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,940
亲爱的
Oh, honey! Oh!

119
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,070
没想到你会来
I didn't know you were coming.

120
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,170
你知道她会来吗
Did you know she was coming?

121
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,600
完全不知道
No, I had no idea.

122
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,580
见到你们真开心
Oh, it's so great to see you guys.

123
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,250
坐下好好聊聊吧
Well, come on. Let's sit down.

124
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,670
黛比姑妈  我们也很想坐下
Aunt Deb, we'd love to, but we're in

125
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,520
不过我们面临着厨房危机
the middle of a culinary crisis right now.

126
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,950
我们把火鸡搞砸了
We, um, screwed up the turkey.

127
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,330
还冻着呢
It's still frozen.

128
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:37,900
"我们"
"We."

129
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,690
看来我来得正是时候
Well, then I got here just in time.

130
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,260
我是麦格瑞特  好  马上来
McGarrett. Yeah, okay, I'm on the way.

131
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,000
我得走了
I gotta go.

132
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:43,920
什么  你这就要走了
What, you're leaving already?

133
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,330
有工作  我得走了
It's work. I gotta go.

134
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,350
拜托你们搞定那只火鸡  好吗
Listen, can you handle the bird, please?

135
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,920
搞笑呢  交给我们妥妥的  快去吧
Are you kidding? We got it covered. Go. Go.

136
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,150
记得要及时跟我汇报进度
I want constant updates, though.

137
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,070
-好吗  -好的  快走吧
- All right? - All right, okay, go, go.

138
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,560
我今天能吃到火鸡的概率是多少
So, what are the odds of me actually eating turkey today?

139
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,530
十分之一还是五分之一
What do I got, a 10% chance? 20%?

140
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,730
放松点好吗  我姑妈黛比在那里呢
Will you relax, okay? My Aunt Deb is there.

141
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,640
她会搞定一切的
She's gonna figure everything out.

142
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,720
姑妈黛比  你爸爸的妹妹
Oh, your Aunt Deb. Your father's sister.

143
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,540
你妈妈假死之后照顾玛丽的那位吗
The one who took care of Mary after your mother faked her death?

144
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,540
-你有个很大的问题  -我吗
- There's something seriously wrong with you, you know that? - Me?

145
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,700
你很喜欢提醒我那件事
You like reminding me of that?

146
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,840
为什么你那么喜欢提
Why would you like reminding me of that?

147
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,570
法医

148
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,160
-那是事实啊  -是  那是事实
- It's the truth. - Yes, it's the truth.

149
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,850
事实的确如此
Yes, it's the truth.

150
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,700
黛比姑妈独自把玛丽拉扯大
Aunt Deb who raised Mary all by herself.

151
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,190
她肯定很不容易
That must have been trying.

152
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,020
你根本无法想象
You don't know the half of it.

153
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,520
为了玛丽这个孩子
She walked away from a record deal

154
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,250
她拒绝了一份唱片合约
when that kid got thrown in her lap, you know that?

155
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,610
-她还唱过歌  -你不知道吗
- She was a singer? - You didn't know that?

156
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,580
我不知道啊
I did not.

157
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,320
那时她已经当了二十年伴唱歌手了
Yeah, she struggled as a backup singer for 20 years,

158
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,240
终于要苦尽甘来有所改变
and she finally got a big break,

159
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,290
但因为玛丽的出现
but she walked away from it

160
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,920
她毅然决然地放弃了
as soon as Mary came into the picture.

161
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,030
-就那样  -就那样  兄弟
- Just like that, huh? Just like that, man.

162
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,100
她知道要是她一年中有半年在演出
She knew she couldn't raise a kid

163
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,130
她就不可能好好养育这个孩子
if she was gonna be on the road half the year,

164
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,830
所以她放弃了
so she quit.

165
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,460
然后成为了一名歌唱教练
She became a singing coach instead.

166
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,070
-凯瑟琳  -来了
- Oh, ah, Catherine. - Yeah?

167
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,040
什么状况
What's up?

168
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,310
说说我们的发现
All right, here's what we know:

169
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,240
四名渔夫出海拖捕箭鱼
so, a four-man crew was out trolling for some skipjack

170
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,700
结果拖上来了这玩意
when they hooked this.

171
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,130
170升的油桶  不像是平常的渔获
Huh. 45-gallon barrel. That's not your usual bycatch.

172
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,660
让我猜猜  里面有具尸体
Let me guess. There's a-a body in here.

173
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,700
打开看看不就知道了
Just take a look.

174
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,890
好吧
All right.

175
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,010
不是吧
Oh, no.

176
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,860
他的其他残肢呢
Where's the rest of him?

177
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,030
想买什么  女士们
Help you ladies?

178
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,390
我们想买只火鸡
Yeah, we need a turkey.

179
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,410
你们知道今天是感恩节吧
You know it's Thanksgiving, right?

180
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,500
头罩男  我们不需要嘲讽
Yeah. Look, hairnet, we don't need sarcasm,

181
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,020
只要火鸡  好吗
all we need is a turkey, okay?

182
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,100
求你了  我们真的很急
Please? We're desperate.

183
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,560
我找找看
Let me check.

184
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,540
来  亲爱的  来抱抱  不哭啊
Here, honey, come here. No-no-no-no-no-no.

185
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,380
来  来抱抱  抱抱啊
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

186
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,910
-你确定  -当然了  来
- Are you sure? - Oh, yeah. Come on.

187
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,410
小宝贝
My baby.

188
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,810
你真会带孩子
You're like a baby whisperer.

189
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,120
我还是有几招的嘛
I got my moves.

190
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,370
-是吗  能教教我吗  -怎么了
- Oh, yeah? Can I have some? - What is it?

191
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,740
我不知道  我觉得有些应付不过来
I don't know. I just, I really feel like I'm in over my head.

192
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,910
你照顾我时也会有这种感觉吗
Did you ever feel like that with me?

193
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,950
-一直都有  -真的吗
- Always. - Really?

194
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,400
看来我折腾得你很惨啊
So I'm guessing I didn't make life very easy for you.

195
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,670
这么说吧
Well, let me put it this way.

196
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,930
小孩子都是这样的
You had your moments.

197
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,000
你是怎么撑过来的  黛比
How'd you do it, Deb?

198
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,070
我根本不知道自己在做什么
I mean, I feel like i have no clue what I'm doing.

199
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,450
你以为我当时就知道吗
You think I did?

200
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,530
亲爱的  我一直是即兴发挥的
Oh, honey, I-I was winging it the whole time.

201
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,950
现在还心有余悸
And it-it was scary.

202
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,440
当妈是世界上最难的工作
Being a mom is the hardest job in whole wide world.

203
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,220
但我觉得没有人
But, you know, I can't think of anybody

204
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,060
能比你更胜任这份工作
who's better suited for it than you.

205
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,430
你心很宽
You got a big heart.

206
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,190
又很聪明
You're smart.

207
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,460
你要做的就是全心全意地爱她
All you have to do is love her with everything you got

208
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,360
一切就会好起来了
and you're gonna be fine.

209
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,950
小甜心
Hey, sweetie.

210
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,880
好了  给你
Okay, here we are.

211
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,170
开玩笑吧
Oh, you're kidding.

212
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,340
这就是最好的了吗  垃圾堆里捡来的吧
That's the best you got? The runt of the litter?

213
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,100
下次早点来买
Hey, next time plan ahead.

214
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,400
谢谢你的好提议
Thank you for that sage advice.

215
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,020
日本  东京

216
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,020
日本  东京

217
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,200
你说什么  表哥
What are you saying, cuz?

218
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,170
我说结束了
I'm saying it's over.

219
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,710
我们从东京回来之后
After we got back from Tokyo,

220
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,130
就抓住了迈克・西村的同伙余党
we took down the rest of Michael Noshimuri's allies.

221
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,360
那个帮派已经消失了  科诺
That faction's gone, Kono.

222
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,260
他们已经玩完了
They're finished.

223
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,040
亚当那有消息吗
Any closer to finding Adam?

224
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,370
就我目前掌握的线索来看
Um, from what I've been able to piece together,

225
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,250
我觉得他在西雅图
I think he may be in Seattle.

226
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,280
所以我今天就飞去那里
So I'm flying there today.

227
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,220
好的  你现在不用再警惕四周
Okay. It's gonna be easier for you to move around

228
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,950
四处走动也比之前容易一些
now that you don't have to look over your shoulder.

229
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,450
所以就是说
So I guess that means

230
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,680
你会在三万尺的高空过感恩节[9150米]
you'll be spending Thanksgiving at 30,000 feet.

231
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,360
餐桌上没有你感觉空荡荡的
Table's gonna feel empty without you.

232
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,340
明年我会在的
I'll be there next year.

233
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,690
我保证
I promise.

234
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,410
我要走了
Hey, look, I should get going.

235
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,470
我可不想误机
I don't want to miss my flight.

236
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,340
祝你好运
Good luck.

237
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,260
谢谢  表哥  谢谢你为我做的一切
Mahalo, cuz... for everything.

238
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,610
我刚刚和科诺打过电话
I just got off the phone with Kono.

239
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,340
她准备去西雅图
She's heading to Seattle.

240
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,720
有新线索吗

241
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,900
拭目以待吧
We'll see.

242
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,050
有什么新发现
So where are we at?

243
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,110
据方所说
Okay, according to Fong,

244
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,810
装死者的桶里放满了碱液
the barrel our vic was found in was filled with lye.

245
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,850
惊奇吧  具有强腐蚀性
Surprise, it's highly corrosive.

246
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,670
便宜又好买
It's also cheap and easy to get.

247

-麦克斯尸检完了吗  -是的

- Busy day. - Yeah, we can see that. What's going on?

260
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,010
总统正在来这的路上
The president's on his way to the Island.

261
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,150
他今天晚些时候会到

262
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,360
他通常都在特区过感恩节

263
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,590
但是两天前他决定要来这儿
but two nights ago he decided he wanted to come here.

264
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,620
没给我们多少时间  但是我们会准备好的
Doesn't leave us much prep time, but... we'll be ready.

265

有什么能帮你的吗
What can I do for you?

266
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,650
我们得谈谈你的一个探员  凯尔・鲁索
We need to talk to you about one of your agents, Kyle Russo.

267
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,650
他怎么了

268
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,920
他昨天被谋杀了
He was murdered yesterday.

269
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,300
什么
What?

270

今早在海边
We found his remains in a barrel

271
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,510
我们在一个汽油桶里找到了他的部分遗体
just offshore this morning.

272
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,450
-有嫌疑人吗  -没有
- You got any suspects? - No, sir, we don't.

273
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,580
但作案手法看起来很专业
But everything is pointing to a professional hit.

274
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,730
你最后一次跟鲁索探员联系是什么时候
When was the last time you spoke with Agent Russo?

275

277
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,940
检查总统会前往的一家书店
to check on a bookstore POTUS might want to visit.

278
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,600
他什么时候给你发的信息
What time did he send that text?

279
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,240
九点后不久  怎么了
A little after 9:00. Why?

280
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,210
法医推测的死亡时间
Because our M.E. puts time of death someplace

281
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,210
大概在五点到七点之间
5:00 and 7:00.

282
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,810
也就是说杀害鲁索探员的凶手
That means Agent Russo's killer

283
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,100
拿走了他的手机  给你发了信息
took his phone, sent you that text so you wouldn't

284
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,870
这样你就不会因为他今早没出现
be suspicious when he didn't show up

285
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,220
-而心生怀疑  -没错
- for work this morning. - Right.

286
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,530
天呐
My God.

287
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,480
坎贝尔探员  怎么了
Agent Campbell. What?

288
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,000
我们所有探员的手机里
All our agents have intel on POTUS's trip

289
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,770
都有总统此次行程的情报
stored on their phone.

290
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,330
精确到半分钟的行程表
Itinerary down to the half-minute,

291
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,670
车队的行驶路线
path of the motorcade,

292
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,700
以及应急方案
emergency protocols.

293
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,340
要是那些情报落入坏人之手
If that intel has fallen into the wrong hands,

294
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,700
总统的安全就会受到威胁了
then we have a threat to the president.

295
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,370
空军一号
距到达还有六小时

296
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,370
空军一号
距到达还有六小时

297
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,590
作为预防措施  我们正在变更车队路线
As a precaution, we're changing the path of the motorcade

298
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,670
以及紧急撤退路线
ascape routes.

299
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,170
火奴鲁鲁警局正帮我们封锁全境
HPD's helping us lock everything down

300
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,820
特警队将作为特勤局的后援
and SWAT's gonna back up our Counter Assault Team.

301
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,240
感谢你能过来  队长
Thank you for coming, Captain.

302
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,060
没事  我们已经全员出动了
No problem. I got everybody on this.

303
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,560
总统套房
希尔顿夏威夷度假村

304
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,560
总统套房
希尔顿夏威夷度假村

305
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,530
好吧
All right.

306
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,700
-需要我们干些什么  -开门见山
- What do you want from my team? - Plain and simple.

307
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,950
抓住那个杀了凯尔・鲁索的混蛋
I need you to find the son of a bitch that killed Kyle Russo.

308
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,490
在这儿  我没有资源  没法调查
Now, I don't have assets in place to run an investigation.

309
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,860
现在我唯一关心的
Right now, my only concern has to be

310
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,200
只有总统的安保
the president's safety and security.

311
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,470
没有比这更重要的
I have no other priorities.

312
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,590
好吧  我需要重走一遍鲁索的行程
All right, I need to, uh, retrace Russo's steps.

313
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,390
能告诉我他昨天一天的行程吗
What can you tell me about his activities yesterday?

314
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,900
他昨天大部分时间都在凯卢阿
He was in Kailua for most of it.

315
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,760
总统到达以后
POTUS stays at

316
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,610
会下榻在那儿的一处私人住宅
a private home out there when he's in town.

317
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,470
鲁索当时正在检查当地居民
Russo was looking into some of the residents

318
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,660
-看有没有威胁存在  -他跟你报告了吗
- to see if any of 'em posed a threat. - He check in with you?

319
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,770
当时有个人
He said there was one guy

320
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,110
他说想做些背景调查
he wanted to run some background on,

321
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,570
也许...要再交谈一次
maybe... maybe talk to again.

322
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,580
他给你那人的名字了吗
He give you a name?

323
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,780
凯斯・诺兰  他就说了名字
Keith Nolan. That's all he gave me.

324
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,310
显然  这家伙在那儿租了间房
Apparently, this guy's renting a house out there

325
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,840
距离总统要下榻的地方不足四百米
less than a quarter of a mile from the one pOTUS is staying in.

326
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,380
鲁索说也许没什么
Russo said it was probably nothing.

327
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,790
我昨晚收到信息的时候
When I got that text last night,

328
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,570
我以为那家伙已经排除威胁了
I just assumed the guy checked out.

329
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,420
也许的确如此
Yeah, maybe he did.

330
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,720
但是如果鲁索把他当作潜在威胁
But if Russo considered him a potential threat,

331
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,420
我们就得跟他谈谈
he's somebody we want to talk to.

332
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:34,770
好的
All right.

333
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,610
凯卢阿  凯斯・诺兰租住处

334
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,610
凯卢阿  凯斯・诺兰租住处

335
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,390
诺兰先生
Mr. Nolan?

336
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,390
我是五零特遣队的史蒂夫・麦格瑞特
Steve McGarrett, Five-O.

337
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,500
能跟你谈谈吗
Can we talk to you?

338
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,400
炉子上还烧着开水
Boiling water on the stove.

339
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,930
那家伙走得还挺急
The guy, uh, took off in a hurry.

340
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,000
那可是颗大子弹
That is a big bullet.

341
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,190
这是北约制式步枪弹
This is a NATO 7.62 sniper round.

342
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,520
精确射程一千米
It's accurate up to 1,000 meters.

343
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,230
也许鲁索真有所图
So maybe Russo was onto something.

344
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,370
五零特遣队
Hey! Five-O!

345
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,140
把手放到我能看见的地方  你是谁
Let me see your hands, right now. Who are you?

346
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,220
我叫希拉・希克斯
I'm Sheila Hicks.

347
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,340
我就住这条街上
I live up the street.

348
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,270
我替房主看着这房子
I look after the house for the owner.

349
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,170
我能把手放下了吗  拜托了
Can I put my hands down now, please?

350
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,460
当然可以  很抱歉
Of course you can. I'm sorry.

351
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,980
你...
Uh... you, uh,

352
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,230
你有没有看到过
you happen to get a look at the guy

353
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:47,960
最近住这儿的那个人
that's been staying here?

354
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,070
诺兰先生吗
Mr. Nolan?

355
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,930
看到了  他昨天早上住进来的
Yeah, he got in yesterday morning.

356
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,140
他是从毛伊岛来的
He's from Maui.

357
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,710
可友好了
He's a very friendly guy.

358
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,660
只不过是我女儿
Oh, it's just my daughter!

359
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,570
过来  小甜心
Come here, sweetie.

360
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,800
妈妈  怎么了
Mom, what's going on?

361
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,850
没事
It's okay.

362
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,470
他们是五零特遣队的
These men are Five-O.

363
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,920
我们只是想问几个
We just have some questions

364
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,480
关于租这房子的那位先生的问题
about the man who's renting this house.

365
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,050
能告诉我们他长什么样吗
Can you tell us what he looked like?

366
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,600
当然  他大概四十多岁
Sure. He's 40s.

367
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,670
一米八三
Six feet.

368
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,220
黑发  对了  你知道么
Black hair. Oh, and you know what?

369
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,150
他脖子后面有个纹身
And he had a tattoo on the back of his neck.

370
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:16,960
那这个人呢
How 'bout this guy?

371
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,800
-你  你见过他吗  -见过
- You, uh... you seen him? - Yes.

372
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,820
我看到他昨天和诺兰先生在外面谈话
I saw him and Mr.Nolan talking outside yesterday.

373
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,810
那是什么时候
What time was that?

374
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,270
刚过四点吧
Little after 4:00?

375
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,130
他并没待很久
You know, he didn't stay very long.

376
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,490
大概就三四分钟
Maybe three, four minutes.

377
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,510
他就走了
And then he left,

378
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,120
之后诺兰先生也走了
and Mr. Nolan took off right after that.

379
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,200
不过  我从那之后就再也没见过他们俩了
But I-I haven't seen either of them since.

380
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,580
好吧  那你呢
Okay, how 'bout you?

381
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,280
你看到什么了吗
You see anything?

382
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,960
我才到这一小时
I just got in an hour ago.

383
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,350
她是为了过节才回来的
She flew in for the holiday.

384
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,980
我的安德莉娅宝贝前几个月一直在旅行
My Andrea's been traveling for the last few months

385
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,280
但是她想回来和妈妈一起过感恩节
but she wanted to spend Thanksgiving with her mom.

386
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,530
真贴心
Oh, that's nice.

387
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,420
真贴心  钥匙给你
That's nice. Uh... here's your keys.

388
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,330
-谢谢  -抱歉刚刚吓着你了
- Thank you. - Sorry about the scare,

389
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,250
谢谢你的帮助
and thanks for your help.

390
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,470
如果你们还需要帮助的话  到隔壁找我
You need anything, I'm right next door.

391
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,470
-多事的邻居是警察之友  -对
- Nosy neighbor is a cop's best friend, right? - Right.

392
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,150
好的  谢了
All right, thank you.

393
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,560
好吧  毛伊岛警局的记录里
All right, so Maui PD has no record

394
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,690
没有任何一个凯斯・诺兰
of anyone named Keith Nolan

395
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:04,690
符合我们的描述
that matches our description.

396
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,080
根据运输安全局的记录
And according to TSA,

397
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,660
昨天抵达这儿的人里也没有这么个名字
nobody flew in yesterday under that name.

398
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,990
所以让我来乱猜一下
So I am taking a wild guess,

399
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,620
"凯斯・诺兰"只是个化名
"Keith Nolan" is an alias.

400
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,690
好吧  那鲁索...
All right, so Russo...

401
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,990
他到这里来巡查
he's out here clearing houses,

402
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,070
遇见了一个自称为"凯斯・诺兰"的家伙
he meets a guy who calls himself "Keith Nolan",

403
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,300
他发现了什么
he gets a vibe.

404
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,420
好吧  我觉得
All right, I'm thinking maybe

405
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,660
也许诺兰察觉到鲁索盯上他了
Nolan could sense that Russo was onto him.

406
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,260
于是他跟踪鲁索  然后杀了他
He follows him and he kills him.

407
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,650
这是个不错的理论
It's a good theory.

408
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,880
如果我们是对的  我就只有一个疑问
If we're right, I only have one question:

409
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,040
这个家伙在特勤局公开之前
this guy had to have known the president was coming

410
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,010
就得知道总统要来
before the Secret Service went public with it.

411
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,300
而这是个机密的消息
That's closely-guarded info.

412
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,240
他怎么知道的
How did he get it?

413
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,070
先遣队已经着陆了36个小时了
Advance team's been on the ground for 36 hours.

414
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,320
也许他是推测出来的
Maybe he figured it out.

415
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,140
我是麦格瑞特
Yeah, McGarrett.

416
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,870
等一下  你说什么
Wait a minute, what?

417
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,140
什么意思  她被...
What do you mean, she was...

418
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,560
她什么时候被抓的
When was she arrested?

419
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,000
玛丽被抓了
Oh, Mary got arrested.

420
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,240
-不  是我姑妈  -你姑妈被抓了
- No, my aunt. - Your aunt got arrested?

421
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,600
这我倒是没料到
I didn't see that coming.

422
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,830
火奴鲁鲁警局

423
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,630
你好
Hi.

424
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,720
你好
Hi.

425
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,980
谢谢
Thanks.

426
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,400
给我点时间
A second.

427
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,330
你还好吗
You okay?

428
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,530
还不错
I'm fine.

429
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:09,900
很好
Good.

430
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,800
想告诉我发生了什么吗
Do you want to tell me what happened?

431
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,390
好吧  我...
Well, I...

432
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,300
我想买些大麻  然后...
I needed some grass, and, uh...

433
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,050
我怎么知道那家伙是个缉毒的
how was I supposed to know the guy was a narc?

434
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,220
-什么  -如果不是药房的那群法西斯
- What? - I wouldn't even be here

435
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,280
我才不会沦落至此呢
if it weren't for those fascists at the dispensary.

436
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,730
他们也不会拿走我的卡
They wouldn't take my card.

437
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,950
药房
The dispensary?

438
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,050
-你...-柜台后面那家伙告诉我
- What... - Yeah, and the guy behind the counter

439
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,540
找谁可以买到大麻
told me where I could find some,

440
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,220
然后我就碰上缉毒刑警了...
and then I run into this narc...

441
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,540
暂停一下  等一下
Okay, stop, please. For a minute.

442
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,240
怎么了
What?

443
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,930
-我们倒回去一下  -好
- Can we go back? - Yeah.

444
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,290
你为什么会有张医用大麻的卡
Why do you have a medical marijuana card?

445
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,350
我有白内障
I have cataracts.

446
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,610
你有白内障吗
You have cataracts?

447
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,460
对啊
Yes.

448
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,920
白内障  人老了就会有的
Cataracts, that's what happens when you get old.

449
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,380
你和我说的是实话吗
Are you telling me the truth?

450
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,670
一半的人在我这个年龄都会得白内障
Look... half the people my age get them.

451
00:16:58,930 --> 00:16:59,860
黛比
Deborah.

452
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,650
-史蒂芬...-我是个警察
- Steven... - I'm a cop.

453
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,210
我的工作就是读出别人的想法
I read people for a living.

454
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,680
你对我没有实话实说
You're not telling me everything.

455
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,570
我本不想这么做的
This isn't how I wanted to do this.

456
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,370
做什么
Do what?

457
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,080
好吧...
Okay, um...

458
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,800
几个月前  我觉得不太舒服
A couple of months ago, I wasn't feeling so good,

459
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,590
而且  我一直很累
and, um... I was tired all the time,

460
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,940
恶心  头疼
nauseous, headaches...

461
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,620
所以我去看了医生
So I went to the doctor

462
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,660
他们给我做了一大堆检查  然后...
and they ran a whole bunch of tests, and, um...

463
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,870
结果是...
Turns out...

464
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,460
我的脑袋里有个肿瘤
I have a tumor in my brain.

465
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,680
你得了癌症
You have cancer?

466
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,530
是的
Yeah.

467
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,090
情况有多糟
How bad is it?

468
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,450
不太好
It's bad.

469
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,870
好吧
Okay, all right.

470
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,690
你有什么打算
What's the plan?

471
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,940
想怎么治疗
What's the course of treatment?

472
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,840
没有治疗
Well... there is none.

473
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,730
什么都没有...
There is none, it's... it's...

474
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,800
那太遥远了
it's too far along.

475
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,950
不  但是  你知道的
No, but... you know,

476
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,830
化疗  放疗
chemo, radiation...

477
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,400
不  我们讨论过那个
No, we talked about that,

478
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,130
但是我...我决定不做治疗
but I... I decided against it.

479
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:14,980
为什么
Why?

480
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,980
因为他们说这不管用...
Because they said it wouldn't work...

481
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,370
所以我...
so I...

482
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,080
所以你就  你就直接放弃了吗
All right, so you just... that's it? You just give up?

483
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,190
-你就打算这么做了吗  -不  等等
- Is that what you're gonna do? - No, no, no, no, wait.

484
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,220
你不能放弃  你不能
Cause you can't do that. No, you can't,

485
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,750
你得...你得积极治疗
because that's what... You gotta fight this.

486
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,860
听我说
Listen to me.

487
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,210
我不希望把我所剩下的时间
I don't want to spend whatever time I have left

488
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,820
浪费在医院里
in some hospital,

489
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,650
大把大把地吃那些有毒的药
getting pumped full of poison

490
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,830
让自己这么难受  好吗
and feeling crappy all the time, okay?

491
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,880
我不想那样
That's not how I want to do this.

492
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,340
这是我的决定
This is what I've decided.

493
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,430
我懂的...
I know...

494
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,230
好吧
Okay.

495
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,340
所以你才来这里的  对吗
That's why you're here, isn't it?

496
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,950
你想跟我们道别
You wanted to come say good-bye to us.

497
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,190
听着  你不能告诉你妹妹
Listen, uh... you can't say anything to your sister.

498
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,530
什么  等等
Wait, what?

499
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,090
你不能这样  黛比  这不公平
You can't do that, Deb. That's not fair.

500
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,000
你不能不告诉她
You can't keep this from her.

501
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,130
不  我会告诉她的
No, I-I'm gonna tell her,

502
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,770
-我只是在等合适的时机  好吗  -好吧
- I'm just waiting for the right moment, okay? - Okay.

503
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,930
你还是赶紧回去工作吧
Look... you better get back to work.

504
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,180
我还得去作笔录呢
I've still gotta get booked.

505
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,430
你不用去
You're not getting booked.

506
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,910
我要去
I am getting booked.

507
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,210
我不要任何特殊待遇  好吗
I don't want any special treatment, okay?

508
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,180
我是认真的
I'm serious.

509
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,660
好吧  好吧
Fine. Fine.

510
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,100
那你就去作笔录吧
You're getting booked.

511
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,430
很好
Good.

512
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,830
等你处理完了我会找人来接你的
I'll send someone to pick you up when you're through.

513
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,760
给我找个帅小哥来  行吗
Make sure he's good-looking, okay?

514
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,850
-孩子  我爱你  -我也爱你
- Kid, I love you. - I love you, too.

515
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,560
会好起来的
It's gonna be all right.

516
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,140
五零特遣队总部

517
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,140
五零特遣队总部

518
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,160
我看了火奴鲁鲁警局调出来的监控录像
So I'm running through some footage that HPD pulled.

519
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,150
总算在杜克市场吃东西的小摊那里
I was able to track kyle Russo's movements

520
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,520
找到了凯尔・鲁索的踪迹
from a food truck he ate at

521
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,130
你们的想法是正确的
through Duke's Marketplace, and you guys were right.

522
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,220
他被人跟踪了  戴棒球帽那个
He was followed. Guy in the baseball cap.

523
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,660
一米八三
All right, about six feet tall,

524
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,230
黑发  脖子后面有纹身
uh, black hair, tattoo on his neck.

525
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,940
与我们知道的描述相符
Matches our description.

526
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,040
继续放下去
All right, keep going.

527
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,690
停车车库

528
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,330
阿成  往回放一点
All right, Chin, roll it back

529
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,280
试试看能不能截取到
Let's see if you could snap in,

530
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,760
他脸部的清晰图像
get a clean frame of his face.

531
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,340
杀手名字是但丁・巴克福
Killer's name is Dante Barkov.

532
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,130
但丁・巴克福

533
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,120
他是个雇佣杀手
He's an assassin-for-hire.

534
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,040
不效忠于任何人
He has no allegiance to anybody.

535
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,260
你们打算怎么找他
What are you doing to find him?

536
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,230
我们已经发布了通缉令
Well, we have an alert out.

537
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,000
我们还在寻找岛上
We're also looking into any known associates

538
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,930
任何可能跟他有关联的人
he may have on the Island.

539
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,070
但目前为止对他的确切位置
But right now, we don't have any leads

540
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,430
还没有任何线索
on his exact whereabouts.

541
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,600
鉴于这种情况
Given the circumstances,

542
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,310
你的老板应该取消行程
your boss needs to cancel his trip.

543
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,920
不可能
That's not gonna happen.

544
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,750
无意冒犯  先生  我们的对手
All due respect, sir, we're not talking about

545
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,410
可不是一个拿着左轮手枪的枪手
a whack job with a six-shooter, here, okay?

546
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,660
这个人对总统来说是极大的威胁
This man represents a serious threat to the president.

547
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,050
先生们...
Gentlemen...

548
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,100
总统不会取消行程的
the president won't cancel.

549
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,250
想想这种行为的潜台词
I mean, think of the message it'd send.

550
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,730
潜台词
The message?

551
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,120
你觉不觉得这位先生没在跟我们说实话
You get the feeling this gentleman isn't telling us the truth?

552
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,410
你也觉得呀
Oh, do you get that feeling, too?

553
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,600
这次行程与感恩节无关  对吗
This trip is not about Thanksgiving, is it?

554
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,740
如果是的话 
If it was, the president

555
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,990
因为这个人的存在
would turn his plane around and go home

556
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,420
总统肯定会让飞机调头回家的
because of a man like this.

557
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,160
你为什么不跟我们说实话
So why don't you level with us,

558
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,940
告诉我们这烟雾弹是为了什么
and tell us what this smoke screen is all about?

559
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,020
总统是来这里
The president is coming for a secret meeting

560
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,670
跟几个朝鲜人开秘密会议的
with a small group from North Korea.

561
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,330
这次是一对一的面谈
These are one-on-one talks

562
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,630
可能会导致裁军
which could lead to disarmament,

563
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,200
甚至是政权更迭
maybe even regime change.

564
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,010
代价太大了
The stakes are huge.

565
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,440
他不会取消行程的
He won't cancel.

566
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,240
先生们  不管我们怎么想
Gentlemen, whether we like it or not,

567
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,820
空军一号今晚六点就会降落
Air Force One is wheels down at 6:00 P.M.

568
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,890
如果你是对的
If you're right,

569
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,140
那么巴克福就仍然在谋划刺杀总统
Barkov is still planning to assassinate the president.

570
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,200
我们还有两个小时来把他找出来
We have two hours to find him.

571
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,450
空军一号
离着陆还有两小时

572
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,450
空军一号
离着陆还有两小时

573
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,840
我刚跟方打完电话
I just got off the phone with Fong,

574
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,360
他觉得巴克福在处理凯尔・鲁索的尸体时
who thinks Barkov might have had some help

575
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,540
肯定找了人帮忙
in disposing of Kyle Russo's body.

576
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,550
作案手法看起来非常专业
It turns out that the M.O. is pretty specific.

577
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:47,970
首先
For starters,

578
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,150
凶手用的碱是钾碱
the lye that was used was actually potassium lye.

579
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,890
比一般使用的品种要少见
It's a lot less common than the regular kind.

580
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,170
而且加了水进行混合  加速了反应
Also, it was mixed with water, which speeds up the reaction.

581
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,110
我把这种作案手法跟旧案作了交叉比对
I cross-referenced this particular M.O.

582
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,480
找到了几个相似的犯案人员
with some old cases and got a few hits.

583
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,020
有没有跟巴克福有关联的
Anyone with a connection to Barkov?

584
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,080
只有一个
Just one.

585
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,090
拉斐尔・莫雷诺
Rafael Moreno.

586
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,840
他是阿尔巴尼亚罪案团伙的善后人员
He's a cleaner for an Albanian crime syndicate.

587
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,920
据说巴克福被他雇佣犯过几次案
Barkov allegedly did some jobs for him.

588
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,460
根据国际刑警的消息
Now, according to Interpol,

589
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,680
莫雷诺至少处理过十几具尸体
Moreno has disappeared at least a dozen bodies

590
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,020
在过去的18个月里
in the last 18 months.

591
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,420
国际刑警  拉斐尔・莫雷诺

592
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,410
所以  鲁索开始调查巴克福后
Okay, so Barkov kills Russo

593
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,910
就被他所杀
once Russo gets onto him,

594
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,650
但处理尸体这事巴克福不在行
but, uh, body disposal isn't exactly in his wheelhouse.

595
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,700
所以他打电话给这个叫拉斐尔的男人
So he calls his boy, Rafael,

596
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,610
让他启程飞往瓦胡岛去帮他
who hops a flight to Oahu to help out.

597
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,120
但事实是没有任何拉斐尔・莫雷诺
Except for the fact that there's no record

598
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,280
登机入境的记录
of any Rafael Moreno on any inbound flights.

599
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,530
所以他用了假身份证
So he used a fake ID.

600
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,850
所以我让运输安全局去查看
Which is exactly why I've got TSA checking to see

601
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,740
是否有拍到他在机场的快照
if they took any snapshots of him while he was at the airport.

602
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,250
如果我们能确定他乘坐的是哪班飞机
If we can determine what flight he was on,

603
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,160
我们就能知道他用的假名
we can get an alias.

604
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,570
对  在全岛追查他
Right, track him down here on the Island,

605
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,920
看能不能通过他找到巴克福
see if he can lead us to Barkov.

606
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,530
运输安全局来消息了
Hey, this is TSA now.

607
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,170
能抽空和我聊聊吗
you got a second for me?

608
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,630
和你聊一辈子都行
For you I got a whole minute.

609
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,960
谢谢  过来
Thank you. Come here.

610
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,280
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

611
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,050
是黛比吗
Deb?

612
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,110
是我
Yeah.

613
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,380
我是凯瑟琳・罗林斯  史蒂夫的朋友
I'm Catherine Rollins; I'm Steve's friend.

614
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,660
只是朋友
Friend?

615
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,260
史蒂夫让我来接你
Steve asked me to, uh, come pick you up

616
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,600
然后送你回他家
and take you back to his place.

617
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,490
他有告诉你别的事情吗
And did he tell you anything else?

618
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,170
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

619
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,420
你有任何需要
If there's anything you need at all,

620
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,970
-尽管开口  好吗  -谢谢
- just please let me know, okay. - Thank you.

621
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,070
我送你回家吧
Let's get you home.

622
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,790
不  我现在  还不想回去
No, I don't... I don't want to go back there just yet.

623
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,640
那你想去哪里
Where would you like to go?

624
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,870
带我去这个岛上最美丽的地方
Take me to the most beautiful spot on the Island.

625
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,190
我刚好知道这个地方
I know just the place.

626
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,660
走吧
Come on.

627
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,520
我需要你的建议
I need some advice.

628
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,680
是关于  我姑妈的
It's, uh, it's about my aunt.

629
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,950
黛比姑妈  她病了
Aunt Deb, she's sick.

630
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,480
病了
She's sick?

631
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,770
你指...
Sick, uh...

632
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,190
她生病了  她得了脑瘤
She's sick; she's got a brain tumor.

633
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,820
我很遗憾  兄弟						
I'm sorry, man.

634
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,040
医生怎么说
What, uh, what-what are they gonna do?

635
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,810
这没办法动手术
It's inoperable,

636
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,270
但她拒绝任何其他治疗
but she's refusing any other kind of treatment.

637
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,230
那是她自己的选择吧
I guess that's her choice, right?

638
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,890
是  这是她自己的选择  但问题是
Well, yeah, it's her choice, but here's the thing.

639
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,580
这事不止影响到她自己一个人
I mean, it's not just her who's gonna be affected by this.

640
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,680
玛丽怎么办
I mean, Mary?

641
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,650
失去她  玛丽一定会崩溃的
Mary-Mary's gonna be destroyed if we lose her.

642
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:35,890
你明白吗
Okay?

643
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,520
先是妈妈展现了拿手好戏  不告而别
First Mom pulls her famous disappearing act again

644
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,500
现在姑妈又病了
and now this?

645
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,080
我该怎么做
What do I do?

646
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,150
我该怎么...怎么才能让她改变主意
How do I... How do I get her to change her mind?

647
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,720
我不这么认为
I don't think, uh,

648
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,910
我觉得你...你不一定要让她改变主意
I don't think you... I don't think you do try to change her mind.

649
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,600
听着  如果这是...
You know, I mean, look, if this...

650
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,070
你们在一起的最后一个感恩节
is your last Thanksgiving together,

651
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,960
难道你想在争吵中度过吗
what, you want to spend it arguing?

652
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,890
当然不想
No.

653
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,260
你想试着留下些回忆
You want to try to make some memories,

654
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,790
一些美好的  永恒的回忆
some good memories, something that's gonna last,

655
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,540
不管接下来发生什么
something that's gonna bring you through

656
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,620
这些回忆能陪伴你走下去
whatever's coming next.

657
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,900
这是我的想法
That's my opinion.

658
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,640
我很遗憾
I'm sorry, man.

659
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,940
运输安全局来消息说
Hey, so TSA came through.

660
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,570
莫雷诺搭乘了昨天的晚间航班
Moreno flew in late last night

661
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,320
用的是迪戈・希尔瓦这个假名
using the name Diego Silva.

662
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,040
同样用这个假名租了辆车
Rented a car using the same alias.

663
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,940
我试着通过定位找到了他
I was able to ping it and get a location.

664
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,070
五零特遣队
Five-O!

665
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,230
五零特遣队
Hey, Five-O.

666
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,380
不许动  你敢动试试看
Hey, hey, don't move. Don't you move.

667
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,520
拉斐尔・莫雷诺  你被捕了
Rafael Moreno, you're under arrest.

668
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,870
跪下
Get down on your knees.

669
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,960
把手举到背后  十指交叉
Put your hands behind your head, interlock your fingers.

670
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,210
你认真的吗
Really?

671
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,550
你真觉得你这种蹩脚的小动作会有用吗
You really thought that lame ass move was gonna work?

672
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,940
兄弟  你看起来可比这聪明多了
Brother, you're a lot dumber than you look.

673
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,480
起来
Get up.

674
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,030
史蒂夫  房子其他地方都没人
Steve, the rest of the house is clear.

675
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,580
有些你会感兴趣的东西
There's something you're gonna want to see.

676
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,690
我来看着他  我来看着他
I got him, I got him.

677
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,310
怎么了
What's the matter?

678
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,640
是不是有人击中你了
Somebody shoot you?

679
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,020
看你身上这讨人厌的小伤口
'Cause you got a nasty boo-boo.

680
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,460
看起来巴克福也一直在这里
Looks like Barkov's been staying here as well.

681
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,150
但问题是他现在在哪里
The question is where is he now?

682
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,400
好的
Okay, good.

683
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,940
保持联系
Yeah, keep me posted.

684
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,160
坎贝尔刚和我打完电话
That was Campbell.

685
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,600
特勤处  他们又有麻烦了吗
The Secret Service, did they blink?

686
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,380
空军一号正被转移到科纳
Air Force One is being diverted to Kona,

687
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,980
正如我们所要求的  他们正改变安保细节
and they are pulling the security detail as we speak.

688
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,750
房子那里怎么样了
What about the house?

689
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,730
鉴证科找到巴克福去向的线索了吗
CSU find anything that can tell us where Barkov's headed?

690
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,750
还没有
No, not yet.

691
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,160
他们现在在搜查车库
They're going through the garage right now.

692
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,140
不过他们确实发现了几包碱
They did find a couple bags of lye, though.

693
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,650
他们一定是把鲁索的尸体带到这里来了
This must be where they brought Russo's body.

694
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,710
谢谢  队长
Thanks, Captain.

695
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,390
你要告诉我们巴克福现在在哪里吗
So you gonna tell us where Barkov is?

696
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,210
拉斐尔  我跟你明确一下
Rafael, let me, uh, you know, break it down for you,

697
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,190
因为你看起来很困惑  我帮你整理一下
'cause you seem like you might be confused; I'm here to help you.

698
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,310
你现在是事后从犯  这很糟糕
Uh, you're an accessory after the fact, which is, uh, it's bad.

699
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,310
未参与谋杀  但协助罪犯毁尸灭迹  因此其罪名为事后从犯

700
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,630
有六个国际执法机构想要跟你谈谈
Uh, got about a half dozen international law enforcement agencies

701
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,250
对于那些他们觉得是你干的破事
that want to talk to you, they want to ask you questions

702
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,540
他们有些问题要问你
about some terrible things that they think you've done.

703
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,270
那才刚开始
That's just the beginning.

704
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,670
对啊  更别说
Right, not to mention,

705
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,440
巴克福计划要刺杀总统
Barkov planned to kill the president, too.

706
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,090
我们应该把那个也加进去
We should add that to the list.

707
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,580
什么
What?

708
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,720
我不知道什么总统的事
I don't know nothing about the president.

709
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,390
你当然不知道了
Oh, I'm sure you don't.

710
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,020
你对凯尔・鲁索的事也一无所知吧
Just like you didn't know anything about Kyle Russo, right?

711
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,080
这么说呢  拉斐尔
How about this, Rafael?

712
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,950
你会死在监狱里
You're gonna die in prison.

713
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,550
懂吧
Okay?

714
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:29,970
但是如果你告诉我们
But if you talk to us,

715
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,580
那么可能  可能我们能帮你
then maybe, maybe we can help you.

716
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,610
我要是告诉你任何关于巴克福的事
I tell you anything about Barkov,

717
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,170
我就会死在他枪口下了
I end up in his crosshairs.

718
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:38,940
不会  不会  不会
No, no, no.

719
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,190
我们会保护你
We'll protect you.

720
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,180
躲不过他
Not from him.

721
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,290
美极了
It is beautiful.

722
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,780
在海军服役的时候  我到过世界各地  
You know, the navy took me all around the world,

723
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,400
但是这里...这里才是家
but this...this is home.

724
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:04,860
是啊
Yeah.

725
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,060
凯瑟琳
You know, Catherine,

726
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,880
我感觉你会在留在这里的
I got a feeling you're gonna be sticking around for a while.

727
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,550
所以  我能请你帮个忙吗
So, um, can I ask you a favor?

728
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,460
当然可以
Of course.

729
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:20,810
史蒂夫表面上一副硬汉的形象
You know Steve has that tough guy act down pat.

730
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,650
但其实内心还是
But underneath it all,

731
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,960
那个认为自己失去母亲
he's still that vulnerable little guy

732
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,750
必须快点长大的脆弱的小男孩
who thought he lost his mom and had to grow up too soon.

733
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:35,250
而玛丽  她是唯一真正了解这一点的人
And Mary, she's the only one who really gets that about him

734
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,480
因为她和他一样
because she lived it, too.

735
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,440
一旦我走了后
Well, once I'm gone,

736
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,310
他们会比以往任何时候都更需要对方
they're gonna need each other more than ever,

737
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,230
即便他们俩都不愿意承认这点
even though they both won't want to admit it.

738
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,650
固执的小孩
Stubborn kids.

739
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,300
所以...
So...

740
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,640
你能照料一下  让他们能走得近点吗
Maybe you could see to it that they stay close?

741
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,840
我会的
I will.

742
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,130
我保证
I promise.

743
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,720
谢谢
Thanks.

744
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,890
史蒂夫  找到一张登机牌
Hey, Steve, found a boarding pass.

745
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,790
是巴克福的化名之一
It's one of Barkov's known aliases.

746
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,380
看看到达时间
Check the arrival time.

747
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,710
巴克福在特勤局开始他们的部署前的
Barkov landed on Oahu 12 hours before the Secret Service

748
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,740
12小时就到瓦胡岛了
even started their canvass.

749
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,490
所以要么这家伙会通灵...
So either this guy is psychic...

750
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,630
要么他的目标不是总统
Or the president is not the target.

751
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,920
他是冲其他人来的
He's after somebody else.

752
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,490
谁是目标
Who's the target, huh?

753
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,670
谁是真正的目标
Who's the real target?

754
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,240
怎么了  巴克福来这不是为了总统 
Hey, what's going on? Barkov's not here

755
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,840
他来是有别的活
for the president-- he's on a job.

756
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,930
对啊  鉴于巴克福有需要时
That's right. And since Barkov called Moreno here

757
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,380
就把莫雷诺叫来了
when he needed help,

758
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,620
我在想那工作可能是为
I'm thinking that job was for

759
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,250
他阿尔巴尼亚的老朋友做的
his old friends back in Albania.

760
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,180
你会告诉我他真正的目标是谁吧
You gonna tell me who the real target is?

761
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,430
弟兄们  清场
Huh? Guys, clear out.

762
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,080
鉴证科  快点  给他清场
CSU, come on. Let's clear out.

763
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,080
高品质碱

764
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,030
得了  干嘛  你准备现在用水刑吗
Come on, what, are you gonna waterboard me now?

765
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,040
我可不这么认为
I don't think so.

766
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,630
怎么回事  不  不...
What's going on? No, no...

767
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,800
怎么回事  你告诉我们或者你被烧
What's going on: you're gonna talk or you're gonna burn.

768
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,500
懂了吗  
You understand?

769
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,480
等等  等等  你不能这么做
Wait, wait. You can't do this! Hey!

770
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,000
谁是目标  谁才是目标
Who's the target? Who's the target?!

771
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,720
谁是目标  
Who's the target?! Huh?!

772
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,920
好了  好了  好了
Okay, okay, okay!

773
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,210
行了  巴克福的目标是
Okay. Barkov's target is

774
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,320
-一个在凯卢阿的女人  -还不够
- a woman in Kailua. - Not enough!

775
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,100
安德莉娅・希克斯  安德莉娅・希克斯
Andrea Hicks! Andrea Hicks!

776
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,140
我只知道这么多
 That's all I know!

777
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,550
等一下  等一下
Hold on, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

778
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,310
那个多事的邻居
Hey. The nosy neighbor.

779
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,120
给我们描述巴克福的人
The one who gave us Barkov's description.

780
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,740
她的女儿叫安德莉娅
Her daughter's name was Andrea.

781
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,870
她做了什么会遭到袭击
What did she do to warrant a hit?

782
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,440
我不知道  我没问
I don't know and I didn't ask.

783
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,990
但在完成任务前  巴克福是不会离开的
But Barkov won't leave the Island till the job is done.

784
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,160
希拉・希克斯家没人接电话
No answer at Sheila Hicks'.

785
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,830
凯瑟琳  你找到什么了
Catherine, what do you got?

786
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,880
我一直在调查安德莉娅・希克斯
Okay, so I've been looking into Andrea Hicks.

787
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,880
直到两个月以前  她一直住在达拉斯
Up until two months ago, she was living in Dallas,

788
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,840
她是个牙医  然后...
working as a dental hygienist. Then...

789
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,450
就没有她的消息了
she just dropped off the grid.

790
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,640
知道为什么吗
Do we know why?

791
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,770
根据联调局的信息
Well, according to the FBI,

792
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,790
她目睹了一个俄罗斯犯罪集团的
she witnessed the murder of a high-ranking member

793
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,330
高级成员被杀
of a Russian crime family.

794
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,540
联调局的人想跟她谈谈
The Feds wanted to talk to her--

795
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,800
她却选择躲起来  
she went into hiding instead.

796
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,000
好吧  然后同时这个犯罪集团
Okay, and meanwhile the family,

797
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,670
雇佣了巴克福去找到她
they hire Barkov to track her down

798
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,030
让她永远开不了口
and shut her up,permanently.

799
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,510
好  凯瑟琳  听我说
All right, Catherine, listen to me.

800
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,600
你继续找安德莉娅
You keep trying to find Andrea, okay?

801
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,120
我们快到凯卢阿了
We're almost in Kailua.

802
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,240
好  马上去办
Yeah, you got it.

803
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,290
我们必须赶快离开这
We need to get out of here.

804
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:47,950
什么
What?

805
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,620
妈妈  快点...
Mom, come on...

806
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,980
树林里传来的
Came from the woods.

807
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,250
在周围拉好警戒
Secure the perimeter.

808
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,320
我们要把这封锁起来  让你的人就位
We need to lock it down. Get your men in position.

809
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,670
听到他说的了吧  赶快行动
All right, you heard the man. Let's move out.

810
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,710
那里  那里  那里
There, there, there.

811
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,370
天呐
Oh, my God!

812
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,100
丹尼
Danny!

813
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,720
好了  好了
Okay, okay.

814
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,050
她会没事的
She's gonna be okay.

815
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,790
她没事的  没事的
She's gonna be okay, all right.

816
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,370
她被打中了一边肩膀  没事的
One of the shoulders. She'll be all right.

817
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,160
珍珠港-希卡姆联合基地

818
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,160
珍珠港-希卡姆联合基地

819
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,180
怎么回事
What's the matter?

820
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:25,580
你还好吗
You all right?

821
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,870
我怎么会不好呢
Why wouldn't I be all right?

822
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,530
你看上去有点紧张
Well, you do seem a little nervous.

823
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,280
紧张吗
Nervous?

824
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,840
没有啦  我们马上就要见到总统了
Oh, no, no. We're about to meet the President.

825
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,510
你们怎么能这么镇定  这才是该问的问题
Why are you so zen? That's a better question.

826
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,650
问你们呢
All of you.

827
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,650
我一向这么酷
I'm just cool like that.

828
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,990
要知道  总统是本地人
You know, the President's a local boy.

829
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,770
我们就像他的禁卫军
That makes us practically Hoapili.

830
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,600
搞不懂你在说什么
I don't know what that means.

831
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,380
我也很紧张  在第一次见他的时候
I was nervous, too, the first time.

832
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,830
"第一次见他的时候"
"The first time"?

833
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,260
你什么时候见过总统
When'd you meet the President?

834
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,930
无可奉告
I can't tell you that.

835
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,930
那是机密
It's classified.

836
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,770
机密  是吗
Oh, it's classified, huh? Oh.

837
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,810
是在草莓地行动的时候吗
Was it during, uh, Operation Strawberry Fields?

838
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,440
我已经说太多了
I've already said too much.

839
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,410
我看起来怎么样  正式吗
How do I look? I look all right?

840
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,070
帅呆了
Yeah, you look very handsome.

841
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,130
谢谢
Thank you.

842
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,280
你也很帅
You do, too.

843
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,190
谢谢
Thank you.

844
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:44,340
终于来了  美国的英雄们  看看你们
Here they are, America's heroes. Look at you.

845
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,510
不用谢我们
No thanks necessary.

846
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,920
都是分内的事
All in a day's work.

847
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,140
不过那些长板我要一个  谢谢
I will take one of those longboards though. Thank you.

848
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,770
-谢谢  -谢谢
- Thank you. - Thank you.

849
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,000
谢了  老兄
Thank you, brother.

850
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,580
让我们举杯
All right, I want to make a toast.

851
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,030
为我们能够让世人安心地
Uh, making the world safer for

852
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,520
吃上火鸡和苹果派干杯
turkey and apple pie, that's us.

853
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,810
说到火鸡和苹果派  晚餐在哪儿
Speaking of turkey and apple pie, where's dinner?

854
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,760
那个  我和玛丽
Well, I'm afraid, uh, Mary and I struck out,

855
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,470
出去买火鸡的时候
uh, when it came to finding a turkey

856
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,260
没找到够我们大家吃的大火鸡
big enough to feed everybody here.

857
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,470
但善良的卡玛科纳为了弥补这个缺失
But Kamekona here has graciously offered

858
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:14,920
为我们拿来了  一锅虾煲
to fix... A shrimp casserole.

859
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,240
你们拯救世界
Hey, you guys save the world,

860
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,960
而我拯救了晚餐
I'll save supper.

861
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,120
不行  绝对不行
No, absolutely not.

862
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,420
感恩节怎么能吃虾
We're not eating shrimp for Thanksgiving.

863
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,150
乞丐可没有选择权
Beggars can't be choosers, brah.

864
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,290
不  他们有得选
Actually, they can.

865
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,320
我有对策
Uh, I have a contingency plan.

866
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,450
是吗  什么对策
Really? What kind of plan?

867
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,860
无可奉告  那是机密
I can't tell you, it's classified.

868
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,480
机密还真不少
Again with the classified, huh?

869
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,580
我告诉玛丽了
I had the talk with Mary.

870
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,680
她反应如何
How'd she take it?

871
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,820
她是个坚强的女孩
She's a strong girl,

872
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,960
但我觉得  现在她需要哥哥的安慰
but I think right now, she needs her brother.

873
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,370
我们会度过这道坎的
We're gonna get through this.

874
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,060
对吗
Yeah?

875
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,200
我只是为琼感到难过
I just feel so bad for Joan.

876
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,170
她还那么小  她都不会记得她的姑婆
She's so young, and she's not gonna remember her nanny.

877
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,020
我了解  但没事的
I know. It's okay though.

878
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,110
我们可以给她讲黛比姑婆的事
We're gonna tell her all about Aunt Deb.

879
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,260
我们会告诉她  她的姑婆有多爱我们
We're gonna tell her all about how much she loved us.

880
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,380
好吗
All right?

881
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,760
火鸡的事情  对不起
I'm really sorry about the turkey.

882
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,270
没事
Come on.

883
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,300
今晚这已经是最好的结局了
That's the best thing that could've happened.

884
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,860
火奴鲁鲁  拉玛丽安娜夏威夷风情酒吧

885
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,860
火奴鲁鲁  拉玛丽安娜夏威夷风情酒吧

886
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,480
伙计们  你们真是好观众
Boy, you're a great audience.

887
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,560
既然你们如此出色
And because you're a great audience,

888
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,060
我要给你们一个特别的惊喜
I got a special surprise for you.

889
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,550
他不会又要讲辛纳屈的故事吧
Is he gonna tell that Sinatra story again?

890
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,550
著名美国歌手  歌坛元老级人物

891
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,960
看样子不是
No, I don't think so.

892
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,750
很久  很久以前
Many, many years ago,

893
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,080
我的好兄弟约翰・麦格瑞特总是向我吹嘘
my good friend John McGarrett used to brag about

894
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,890
他的妹妹在洛杉矶那些传奇俱乐部里献唱
his sister singing in these legendary nightclubs

895
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,980
比如卡德罗俱乐部
in Los Angeles, like the Trocadero,

896
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,310
仙乐斯和椰林酒吧
Ciro's and the Cocoanut Grove.

897
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,010
那些音韵绕梁三日不止
And the beat goes on and on.

898
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,050
但我从没听过她的歌声
Well, I never got to hear her.

899
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,660
但命运使然
But as fate has it,

900
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,950
今晚  在这里
right here tonight in this club,

901
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:17,640
黛比・麦格瑞特大驾光临
we have... Deb McGarrett.

902
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,850
黛比  能请你为台下的观众们
Deb, would you please come up and sing a song

903
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,650
献上一曲吗
for this marvelous audience?

904
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,380
这是你计划的
You plan this?

905
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,410
只是想制造些回忆
Just making some memories, right?

906
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,160
我真没想到会让我上台
Well, I certainly didn't expect this.

907
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,820
我已经很久没唱过歌了
I mean, I haven't sung in, well...

908
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,440
上次唱歌就像在一百年前...
about a hundred years, and, uh...

909
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,680
嗓子也不如当年
Well, these old pipes are pretty rusty.

910
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,260
但既然这是个特别的场合
But, uh, since it's a special occasion,

911
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,010
罢了罢了
oh, what the hell.

912
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:16,590
我想将这首歌献给我的家人
I'd like to dedicate this song to my family,

913
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:21,900
我的亲人们  史蒂夫  玛丽和小琼宝贝
my little ohana, Steve, Mary and baby Joanie.

914
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,050
我爱你们  非常爱
I love you all so very much.

915
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,670
开始吧  献丑了
Here goes. Bear with me.

月光赐我闪亮银河*
