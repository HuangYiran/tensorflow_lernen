Let's get more comfortable, hmm?
That okay?

18
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,100
You nervous?

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,000
It seems like you've got a lot on your mind.

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,800
Actually... I do.

What are you doing?

I've passed all my tests. I'm clean.

Would you mind?

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
This won't hurt.

25

You don't have to do anything if you don't want to.

26

People come to me for all sorts of reasons.

Some want to talk or just to be held.

Look, why don't we just have some fun?

29

People look for connections in different ways.

30
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,900
Someone who cares about them.

31

- CSI finished upstairs?
- Shouldn't be long, sir.

38
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,800
- You're a bot.
- Yes, I am.

39
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,100
Cool! What can you do?

40
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,900
- Whoa.
- Oh, awesome!

41
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,500
Are you a robot, too?

42
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,900
No, I'm human.

43
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,800
Oh. What can you do?

44
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,900
Watch this.

45
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:35,900
No, no, no.

46

It doesn't hurt. I got... I got a synthetic leg!

47

I haven't even been a child, and I know that would scare one.

48
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,500
What's the matter with you? You have negative energy, man.

49
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,900
- My energy's great.
- Why don't you like kids? 

50
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,100
I never said I don't like kids. You said I don't like kids.

51
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,100
Children can sense electromagnetic fields, John.

52
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,600
- That's a bunch of baloney.
- They can sense discomfort, frustration and bad energy.

53
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,200
As do felines. I bet you have an issue with cats, too, am I right?

54
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,500
Hey. My issue with cats is none of your business.

55
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,500
- I'm allergic to cats.
- Maybe the cats are allergic to you.

56
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,900
You ever consider that?

57
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,400
Victim is ID'd as Sebastian Jones. He paid for the room with cash.

58

Front desk said he showed up with a woman. Red hair, 20s.

59
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,200
About a half hour later, two men showed up.

60
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,200
There are no fingerprints.

61
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,100
I don't think we're gonna get anything from Forensics.

62
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,900
Everything is tainted in here.

63
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,700
They used a DNA bomb.

64
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,200
I hate that stuff.

65
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,300
Absorption round, third gen.

66
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,300
Wouldn't have made a sound. These guys are good.

67
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,100
Any surveillance?

68
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,800
She came in at 6:15 p. m.

69
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,400
They arrived 20 minutes later.

70
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,800
They're wearing FlashMask.

71
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,900
They took his bag.

72
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,900
John.

73
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,200
She's an android.

74

What do we have on our victim?

75
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Sebastian Jones was a high-end sex trade bot-maker.

76
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah, too bad he's dead.

77
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,300
Could've made you a girlfriend.

78
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,900
I'm not the one with the online dating profile.

79
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,500
I don't have an online dating profile.

80
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,100
You do now.

81
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,900
"Capricorn who loves danger. "

82
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay. While you're at it, why don't you put down

83
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,400
- "Recently lost partner in tragic freeway accident. "
- Guys, what do we have?

84
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,700
Sebastian Jones' company is called Orillian Sapients.

85
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,200
- They specialize in advanced sexual robotics.
- Is this one of his sexbots?

86
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,700
- We don't know.
- Sexbots are licensed.

87
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,300
- Who's it registered to?
- It's not registered to anybody.

88
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,400
Someone owns it. It has to be registered.

89
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,100
What else do we know about his life?

90
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,500
No spouse, no kids, no criminal record.

91
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,800
Legitimate businessman.

92
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,000
- Inventor.
- He has 23 patents to his name and is credited as a pioneer in developing the artificial blush response.

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,100
Every red-blooded man in this city owes a debt to this fallen genius.

94
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,800
Why, because he makes sex trade bots?

95
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,400
Call 'em "bang bots. " They actually like it.

96
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,200
And you know this from experience?

97
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,400
- You say it like it's a bad thing.
- Crimes in the sex trade are down

98
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,400
- 38% since the bots were introduced.
- Right? Do that math.

99
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,100
- The fewer real women that have to sleep with you, Richard, the better off the world is.
- Okay.

100
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,300
- What else do we know about him?
- Sebastian Jones

101
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,800
couldn't pay his bills.

102
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,900
Orillian Sapients declared bankruptcy three months ago.

103

<i>Creditors seized all of his assets,</i>

104

(DEFENDANT: JONES, SEBASTIAN)
Found a court summons.

106
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,100
Sebastian was being sued.

107
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,800
- Kennex.
- Your case just got weird.

108
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,500
I just sent you something. You get it?

109
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,600
Yeah, I got it.

110
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,200
The CSIs went through the elevator at the hotel,
scanning spots these guys

111
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,500
likely touched, trying to pick up some DNA on them.

112
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,400
Yeah. We didn't find any DNA on the guys, but we found something else.

113
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,200
That's the first sample they pulled.

114
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,900
Everywhere she touched, there was DNA from a 25-year-old girl

115
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,900
named Nicole Bloomquist, who was abducted three weeks ago from a parking garage.

116
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,500
Are you telling me the sexbot we're looking for is leaving this girl's DNA?

117
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,200
- It seems that way.
- How?

118
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,200
Correct. How?

119
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,500
Ah, there you go. Perfect, perfect.

120
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,700
Oh, look at you. Wriggle monster.

121
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,300
Okay. Mommy'll take it then.

122
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,700
Give me your hands, give me your face. Beautiful.

123
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,900
<i>Another abduction happened.</i> Same M.O. as Nicole Bloomquist.

124
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,500
20-something female, parking structure. Cameras were disabled.

125
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,200
There's no surveillance of the abduction.

126
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,300
And I found three more missing persons cases with the same pattern.

127
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,500
So, they kill the cams and then take the women.

128
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,100
Yeah, except this time, something was left behind.

129
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,100
He was in the car. His name is Victor.

130
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,900
Can I talk to him?

131
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,900
- Maybe I should talk to him. He's not good with kids.
- Hey.

132
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,400
- Or cats.
- That-That's not... I'm great with kids, really.

133
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,600
I'm Detective Kennex.

134
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,900
You must be, uh, Victor, right?

135
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,200
Victor's a-a good name. It's a good, strong name.

136
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,600
Look, I know this must be hard...

137
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,500
but I need you to be brave.

138
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,900
Okay? I really need you to tell me what happened with your mom.

139
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,700
You like him?

140
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,700
I'll give him to you if you want him.

141
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,100
But you got to promise me to look after him

142
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,800
because he means a lot to me.

143
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
- I promise.
- You promise?

144
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,500
Okay.

145
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,700
I trust you.

146
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,000
Look, Victor.

147
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,900
But I really need your help.

148
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,600
Need you to tell me what happened with your mom.

149
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,700
You guys were in a car, right?

150
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,800
- Your mom got out.
- She went to put the trash away.

151
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,900
Then what happened?

152
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,900
I saw the car.

153
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,500
Did you see who was in it?

154
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,100
Two men.

155
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,200
Two men?

156
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,900
- What happened then?
- The car drove away.

157
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,700
What kind of car was it? What color?

158
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,800
It was a big, silver car.

159
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,300
A big, silver car.

160
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,300
That's good.

161
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,400
When is my mom coming?

162
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,300
Hey, Victor.

163
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,100
You did really good.

164
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,700
- What's up?
- CSI found the silver sedan on a traffic cam

165
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,400
a block from the parking structure.

166
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,500
- The license plates tracked back to a red SUV.
- They're using stolen plates.

167
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,500
We got every plate scanner in the city looking for those tags. We'll find that car.

168
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Okay, two girls were abducted with the same M.O. and one of them,

169
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,200
her DNA was found on the sexbot who was with Sebastian Jones when he was murdered.

170
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,200
I think we should focus on finding the sexbot that was with Sebastian.

171
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,700
If we can access her memory, we might be able to see what happened in the hotel that night.

172
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,900
And identify who did it.

173
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,500
- That's our best bet for finding the missing women.
- Guys, I might have a new angle.

174
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,600
I dug into those summonses you found.

175
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,500
(BOT MAKERS BEGIN LEGAL BATTLE AS FORMER PARTNERS FALL OUT)
Sebastian's former business partner Lorenzo Shaw was suing him for intellectual property infringement

176
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,600
(NEW LINE OF SEXBOTS ANNOUNCED)
and he just opened a sexbot showroom downtown for himself- it's motive.

177
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,300
- He could be involved.
- Check him out.

178
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,200
You were surprisingly good with that kid back there, John.

179
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,400
Even though you had to bribe him with a giraffe.

180
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,700
Thanks.

181
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,700
- Do you think his mother is still alive?
- I hope so.

182
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,100
Every hour she's gone diminishes the chance of us finding her alive.

183
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,800
What do you tell a small child when someone dies?

184
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,500
I've never considered that. What you would tell a small child.

185
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,900
- Well, you say the same thing that you'd say to an adult.
- What do they say?

186
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,000
You tell them that the person that died has gone to a better place.

187
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,700
Why would anyone say that when there's no way to really know where living things go when they stop living?

188
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,600
It's designed to give hope and comfort.

189
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,300
To ease the pain.

190
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,900
People believe it because they need to.

191
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,500
Hmm, the data I've studied suggests that the best proof of one's existence

192
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,600
is if one is remembered after they're gone.

193
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Was your partner's son told that his father went to a better place?

194
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,300
I don't know.

195
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,100
You never spoke to your partner's son?

196
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,400
I can understand why that would be hard for you.

197
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,900
What did you do with my son?

198
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,300
Don't worry.

199
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,300
The authorities will have him by now.

200

- I have money!

201

Anything you want, anything. I'll give you anything.

202
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,900
Please, I just want to see my son...

203
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,000
I already have what I want.

204
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,200
No, no, no!

205
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,800
Your ex-partner, Sebastian Jones, when was the last time you saw him?

206
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,000
Six months? Seven?

207
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,300
- We'd been sort of on the outs lately.
- "On the outs"?

208
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,800
You were suing him.

209
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,800
I have intellectual property rights on designs we developed together at Orillian.

210
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,200
What happens to the I.P. rights now that Sebastian's naked?

211
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,100
Um, I mean "dead. " Now that Sebastian's dead.

212
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,100
- What happens to the I.P. rights?
- Well, they would naturally revert to me.

213
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,100
Is this one of your models?

214
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,700
No, she's not mine.

215
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,100
What about this one?

216
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,600
- Or this one?
- You ever seen these women before?

217
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,900
No, but they're not synthetics.

218
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,300
- How can you be sure?
- In my line of work, you get to know.

219
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,300
You know, I haven't seen one of you in a while.

220
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,700
The latest sexbots have a little bit of your old tech in them.

221
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,000
They're capable of bonding empathetically with their clients.

222
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,700
Sense their moods... and respond accordingly.

223
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,000
It's a significant achievement.

224
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,800
If your bots are so special, why was Sebastian so in debt?

225
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,000
Well, if you knew Sebastian, you'd understand.

226
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,100
He was an artist. We were making good money.

227
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,200
But he was determined to create the next line. Better than the last.

228
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,200
He sunk all our capital into new fabs, tooling, subsystems.

229
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,700
He bet the whole company on it.

230
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,100
And then our biggest client cancelled their contract with us.

231
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,900
Took us completely by surprise. Bankrupted us.

232
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,300
Who was your biggest client?

233
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,700
Ah, if you don't want to tell me, that's okay. We'll just subpoena your records.

234
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,300
Shut you down for a few days while we go through them.

235
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
It was an Albanian consortium.

236
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,000
They said they were cutting out the middle man.

237
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,500
You mean they found a new supplier?

238
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,600
Apparently.

239
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,200
Sebastian couldn't believe that anyone could build
a better sexbot than us.

240
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,000
The first picture I showed you. Did she belong to the Albanians?

241
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,600
Is she why Sebastian was at the hotel the night he was killed?

242
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,300
I wouldn't know.

243
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,100
- Look, I-I don't want to talk about this anymore.
- Did they threaten you?

244
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,600
No... They were good clients.

245
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,000
They always paid on time. And that's all I'm gonna say about them.

246
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Excuse me. I have customers.

247
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,100
Mr. Shaw?

248
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,700
Have you ever heard of people incorporating human DNA into a sexbot?

249
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,600
That's illegal. And I think you know that.

250

You can say you don't like robots all you want.

251

Your pulse says otherwise.

252

What?

253
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,000
Precisely.

254
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,800
I want you to hack into Shaw's customer network.

255
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,600
Find the Albanians.

256

- I agree.

They're testing the bots for human DNA.

Hands out of your pockets.

- No.

No?

- Seen that bot?
- No, no...

We tested all the bots.

268

They all check out. They're clean.

269

- Yup.

We got a hit for the silver sedan.

290
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,000
The one that kidnapped Kristen Haseman in the parking garage.

291
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,100
We picked it up on a plate scanner.

292

Dorian, watch the sedan as it goes past the scanner.

The license plate changes.

294
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,000
They're using a tag scrambler.

295
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Once we realized that, we switched to straight surveillance cams and tracked it to an industrial facility off 8th Street.

296
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,300
What were they doing there?

297

All right, we're three minutes out.

What the hell is that?

300
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,500
- Is that Kristen Haseman?
- It's not human.

301
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,100
This is the android from the hotel.

302
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,900
If this is what they're doing to their sexbots,

303
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,400
imagine what they're doing to the women they've abducted.

304
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,900
Beautiful green.

305
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
They really have got the color just right.

306
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,300
You see, these shots were targeted precisely to shatter the cortical relays

307
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,600
- and storage centers.
- They destroyed her memory.

308
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Yeah, they wanted to ensure no one could retrieve

309
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,800
her recorded memories of Sebastian Jones' murder.

310
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,100
- These albinos knew exactly what they were doing.
- Albanians.

311
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,200
Well, that, that would make more sense.

312
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,000
But there is a small chance that her temporal housing might be intact enough

313
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,200
to salvage some of her echoic memory.

314
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,400
Uh, she might still be able to tell us something about the people that did this.

315
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,100
Apologies, mate. I'm used to being alone when I do this.

316
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,200
- You might want to look away.
- It's fine.

317
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,400
Why did they peel its skin off?

318
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,100
Well, they obviously didn't want us to see that either.

319
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,800
Wait a minute, the surveillance footage at the hotel.

320
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,400
Her hands left traces of human DNA.

321
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,900
You think they're abducting the girls to harvest their skin.

322
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,300
If you used human skin, you'd make the best sex machines on the market.

323
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,600
I think Sebastian found out about it.

324
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,900
- That's why they killed him.
- Sex machine, bang bot?

325
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,100
- It's a bit myopic, isn't it?
- Not everyone who visits a sexbot is looking for sex.

326
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,700
Some people go for the conversation or for a sympathetic ear at the end of a long working day

327
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,200
surrounded by people who only ever come to visit when they want something from you.

328
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,700
I'm just saying that, uh,

329
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,500
the neural interface is quite sophisticated.

330
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,800
Anyway, it appears they're growing skin using DNA from the abducted women.

331
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,200
Well, synthetic skin, as good as it is, is a long way from the real thing.

332
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,600
There are pheromones and other biological features that trigger attraction.

333
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,200
Here it is.

334
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400
Sorry, it's too damaged.

335
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,500
If you want to know where these bots are coming from,

336
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,900
I'm going to have to get my hands on a live one.

337
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,400
So to speak.

338
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,500
You're quiet. What's wrong?

339
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:19,300
Just looking at that bot on Rudy's table makes me think,

340
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,000
who is going to remember me?

341
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,600
You're a cop.

342
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,200
The people you help will remember you,

343
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,100
whatever your name is.

344
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,200
Speaking of names, someone just responded to your dating profile, John.

345
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,900
My dating pro... I thought you were kidding.

346
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,100
Not kidding- I saw the way you were looking at those sexbots.

347
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,100
Your profile name is... Dr. Richard.

348
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,800
- Dr. Richard.
- Who likes quiche,

349
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,900
- long walks on the beach, smooth jazz.
- You seriously did not call me Dr. Richard.

350
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,700
- I thought you wanted to meet someone.
- I meet plenty of women. I don't need your help.

351
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,900
I- I ran a bio scan, and it looked like your testicles were at full capacity.

352
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,800
You're scanning my balls?

353
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,600
I didn't enjoy it, I just...

354
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,900
- Oh, my God, this is unbelievable.
- I can't help but notice you're backed up.

355
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,700
What is the matter with you?

356
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,100
Don't scan my testicles ever again.

357
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,200
Copy that.

358
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,600
What does she look like?

359
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,900
What do you want her to look like?

360
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,800
Brown eyes, soulful.

361
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,800
- Height?
- Average height.

362
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,700
I like brunettes.

363
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,200
Would you date anyone in your profession

364
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,400
or would you prefer to date someone outside of it?

365
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,900
Sure, either way.

366
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,200
I like smart women, you know, women that are smarter than me.

367
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,700
That won't be hard.

368
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,400
You are aware that you just described

369
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,300
Detective Stahl, right?

370
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,700
Kennex.

371
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,100
Hey, we got a 20 on the silver sedan you posted. I just uploaded it to Dorian.

372
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,600
Uh, okay, thank you, um,

373
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,300
Detective Stahl, thanks.

374
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,900
- Okay, thank you, Detective Stahl.
- Shut up.

375
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,000
Shut it, zip it.

376
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,900
Police!

377
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,100
- Don't you move! Put your hands on the dashboard!
- Hands up! Hands on the dash!

378
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,100
- Do not move!
- Hold 'em, keep 'em there!

379
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,600
Put your hands on the dashboard now

380
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,900
- where I can see 'em!
- Turn around, turn around!

381
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,900
- Step out of the car.
- ???

382
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,800
Come on.

383
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Around front.

384
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,500
Hi, I'm Vanessa.

385
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,900
- Hey, how you doing?
- I need to take a DNA sample.

386
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,700
- Open your mouth, please.
- Why?

387
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,600
I've passed all my tests.

388
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,200
Please.

389
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,900
(IDENTIFY SUBJECT)

390
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,600
(MATCH FOUNDED: LORRAINE WHITE)

391
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,500
Her DNA belongs to a Lorraine White, abducted from a parking structure

392
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
two months ago in St. Clair.

393
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,800
- Lab.
- Rudy, found you some skin.

394
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,300
The Albanians aren't telling us where the kidnap victims are.

395
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,600
We need to get that information from a sexbot.

396
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,000
We have three missing girls out there somewhere, maybe more.

397
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,700
I'll pull everything I can from it.

398
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,400
Hello again.

399
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,800
A human's DNA was used to make your skin.

400
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,700
This woman. We need to find her.

401
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,000
We don't have much time. Have you seen her before?

402
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,100
- No.
- I need you to think.

403
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,400
It's really important.

404
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,100
- Have you seen her?
- No.

405
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,500
Where were you made?

406
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Who owns you?

407
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,600
Do you know where you were born?

408
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,200
You ever worked with this girl?

409
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,200
- Charlene.
- Right, Charlene.

410
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,200
Do you know where she was born?

411
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,700
Who owns you?

412
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,600
She's probably not conscious of those terms.

413
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,500
- Where were those men taking you tonight?
- They were taking me for a ride.

414
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,300
- We think they were taking you to be destroyed.
- Why would anybody want to destroy me?

415
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,200
There are much, much better things to do with me.

416
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,800
We don't have to do anything if you don't want to.

417
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,700
I'm a very, very good listener.

418
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,500
You know, people look for connections in different ways.

419
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,400
That's all people are looking for,

420
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,800
is someone who cares about them.

421
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,600
That's what I'm here for.

422
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,400
Do you know where Charlene is?

423
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,600
- Yes.
- Can I see her?

424
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,900
Why do you want to?

425
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,200
- I don't know.
- You were designed to bond with people.

426
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,700
That's what you were developed to do.

427
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,900
To notice when they're there.

428
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,500
That also means you notice when they're not there.

429
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,700
That's why you want to see her.

430
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,900
That's what you're feeling.

431
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,900
Who told you to go with the men we found you with tonight?

432
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,600
Yuri.

433
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,500
Do you know Yuri?

434
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,100
Yeah, we know Yuri.

435
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,100
????1

436
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,700
????2

437
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,400
- ??????3
- ?????4

438
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,600
I'm going upstairs.

439
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,300
All right!

440
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,100
Move!

441
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,900
Move!

442
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,500
Time to go.

443
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,500
Abandon everything.

444
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,500
Destroy the lab.

445
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,800
They'll die.

446
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,400
They can still generate so much skin.

447
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,600
We'll set up somewhere else.

448
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,900
Let's go.

449
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,700
You go first.

450
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,900
- They're not here.
- This isn't the right building.

451
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,300
Office is empty, too.

452
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,500
(IDENTIFY TECH)

453
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,900
I think I can find the skin lab.

454
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,000
- Rudy?
- Yes, Dorian?

455
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,800
Most of these sexbots are platformed on an old UJuno Pendant Learning Module.

456
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,700
Uh, yeah, uh, those modules were available to the public sector once we stopped using them on the DRNs.

457
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,300
Problem was that they were giving off an unwanted GPS signal.

458
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,300
Yeah, it was an unwanted side effect.

459
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,800
Um, whenever they, uh, automatically updated their software,

460
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,200
they'd inadvertently send out a signal allowing those so inclined to, uh,

461
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,700
- track you.
- Is there a log of that?

462
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,600
I'm sure there is.

463
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:44,000
Can you access Vanessa's internal GPS log to find the very first time that the module sent a signal?

464
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,500
- It's possible.
- If we can find out

465
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,800
- the first time she was activated, we can find...
- Find out where she was born.

466
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,400
The skin lab.

467
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,800
All right, bear with me.

468
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,300
I won't be a minute. Oh. Look at that.

469
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,300
That's the charger for my- doesn't matter. Um, here we go.

470
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,800
This is the one I need.

471
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,000
right. Uh, hello.

472
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,900
I need to access your data port.

473
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,400
That sounds rude. Um, I need to insert my... Oh, that's even worse.

474
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,000
Um... Oh, friendly.

475
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Um, it's nothing sexual, I assure you.

476
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,700
Not that there's anything wrong with sex. I mean, who doesn't like sex?

477
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,900
Not me. <i>I mean, I do. That's-that's the point.</i>

478
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,400
But that would be, um, inappropriate at best.

479
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,300
This is not gonna hurt, I promise you. There we go.

480
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,000
right. Just, um...

481
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,300
having a look at your, uh...

482
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,000
...statistics.

483
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,900
(Kingston Heights)

484
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,600
Looks like you

485
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,700
were first activated in Kingston Heights.

486
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,900
Clear!

487
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,000
Clear!

488
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,400
Clear!

489
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,200
???

490
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,100
Clear!

491
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,200
Take him out!

492
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,300
No!

493
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,900
Move it! Move it!

494
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,400
- Drop that weapon!
- Drop it, you!

495
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,700
- Drop the weapon!
- John.

496
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,900
???Down!

497
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,500
Don't shoot! On the ground! Now!

498
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,000
Clear!

499
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,800
- Clear.
- Clear!

500
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,600
Clear!

501
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,200
- This is Lorraine White.
- She's deceased.

502
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Call Bloomquist. She's still alive.

503
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,300
Kristen Haseman- she's alive.

504
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,900
Victor is gonna be very happy to see you.

505
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,900
Great work.

506
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,800
Thanks.

507
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,500
- You should celebrate.
- He will.

508
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,000
- You have a date.
- What?

509
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,600
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do- with the woman from the dating Web site.

510
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,800
Wha...? No.

511
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,600
He has a wonderful profile. She's expecting you at 7:00.

512
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,800
That's a... it's just a... it's a joke, you know.

513
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
I get a lot of women. I mean, not a lot- you know, just...

514
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,700
You should celebrate no matter what.

515
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,600
Have a great night... on your date.

516
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,000
- Thanks.
- Good night.

517
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,000
Benedict Android strikes again.

518
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,800
- I can't go on a date tonight.
- Why?

519
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,700
Because I've already got someone I want to see.

520
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,500
- But, John, if you just...
- Do you have your report done?

521
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,700
Uh, yeah, almost.

522
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,100
We'll need individual certificates when the bots are destroyed.

523
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,200
- Okay?
- Okay.

524
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,800
I'm sorry. We can't have bots with human DNA.

525
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:45,000
She has to be deactivated. But well done. Very well done.

526
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,200
- Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.

527
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,000
You okay?

528
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,700
I'd like to be there.

529
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,100
Thank you.

530
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,700
Where am I going?

531
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,300
To a better place.

532
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,200
Will you be there?

533
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,600
I will remember you.

534
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,500
Marty, do you remember John Kennex?

535
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,700
He was your dad's partner.

536
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,700
I want to tell you about your father.

537
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,500
