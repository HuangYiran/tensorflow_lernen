<i>Previously on "The Mentalist"...</i>

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,850
She told me Red John has a tattoo

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,870
on his left
shoulder-- three dots.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,750
That's my leverage.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,210
Gather all five suspects together

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,990
at the same place, same time,

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,210
and then start checking for the tattoo.

8
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,330
How do we do that?

9
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,390
Meet me at 8:00 on Thursday night.

10
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,050
Fine.

11
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,430
Thursday night at 8:00.

12
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,800
I'll need your help.
Well,then you've got it.

13
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,930
If you don't show up, he
will assume you're Red John.

14
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,440
If I do this, will you and Jane drop

15
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,360
the whole that "I'm Red John" business?

16
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,520
For once and for all.

17
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,010
You really think you've got him?

18
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:32,740
I do.

19
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,180
I want to be there when you end this.

20
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,650
I was hoping you'd say that.

21
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,010
Red John.

22
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,240
Nothing would give me more pleasure
than to be with you there tonight.

23
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,620
Red John... has a tattoo.

24
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,560
Three dots on his left arm.

25
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,130
And you all...

26
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,000
Are gonna show me...

27
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,300
Now.

28
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,040
Let's go. Come on.

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,050
That's it. Take it off.

30
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,770
Nonsense.

31
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,120
It's not what you think.

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,950
You got it wrong.

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,070
I'm not Red John.

34
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,040
Patrick,wait. Patrick!

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,210
Look... here.

36
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,740
Look.

37
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,980
On your feet.

38
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,780
Over with those two.

39
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,540
Oh... God.

40
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,990
You stay there.

41
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,330
Okay,you three...

42
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,710
Over against
that wall-- now.

43
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,710
Call the fire department and E.M.T.s

44
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,480
Let them know that there's multiple
casualties,and set up a perimeter.

45
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,480
Give me your flashlight.
I-I'm going in.

46
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,820
Jane jane

47
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,960
Agent Smith.Agent Smith, it's
Teresa Lisbon.Are you okay?

48
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,230
What happened?

49
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,500
There was an explosion. The E.M.T.s
are on their way.They're gonna help you.

50
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,490
- Don't move!
- What?

51
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,000
Put your hands in the
air, or I'll shoot! Do it!

52
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,250
Okay,listen,I don't know
what you're talking about.

53
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,800
You're clearly making a big mistake.

54
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,720
Which way did Smith go?

55
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,890
- Oh,my God,Lisbon.
- We have to find Smith. He's Red John.

56
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,720
Ah... I'll get help.

57
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,490
Jane?

58
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,910
Can you hear me?

59
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,670
Jane? Come on.

You okay?

64
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,630
I'm fine.

65
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,350
The doctors say Jane's stable.

66
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,510
There's no major trauma or anything.

67
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,140
He's just not awake.

68
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,520
They found the remains of three people.

69
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,960
Positive I.D.s for Bret Stiles,
Ray Haffner,and Thomas McAllister.

70
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,790
Are you sure? I would think Bret
Stiles would survive a nuclear attack.

71
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,050
The bodies are all burnt to a crisp,but
the crime techs did spot D.N.A. tests.

72
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,050
Coroner's office checked
it against medical records.

73
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,580
Stiles,Haffner,and McAllister
are all positively dead.

74
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,420
Uh,what about Smith? Any sightings?

75
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,250
Not yet. Rigsby and Van Pelt are on it.

76
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,030
Sir?

77
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,500
- Ah,thought I might find you here.
- Are you all right?

78
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,920
Uh,I'm fine. I could use
a cup of coffee,actually.

79
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,340
Would you go and get me one?

80
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,740
We're just about to coordinate
the manhunt for Smith.

81
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,340
Well,you should just go and get him.

82
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,620
Well,I'd like to stay
here,sir.Well,are-- Cho and the team-

83
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,080
- they can handle it.
- Are you refusing a direct order?

84
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,380
Well,no.

85
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,720
- No,I just want to stay here with him. -
Wh-why don't you listen a little more closely?

86
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,140
I am ordering you to get out there,

87
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,860
put your team together, and get Smith.

88
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,810
Jane? Jane? Where's
the damn call button?

89
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,430
I'll--I'll
get the nurse.

90
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,700
Jane.

91
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,340
hey boss

92
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,810
Our working theory is that Red John brought in
the bomb to kill Jane and the other suspects.

93
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,120
Okay,but how?

94
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,290
Chances are,Red John snuck
the bomb in on his person.

95
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,870
Crime techs have pulled fragments of the bomb
casings from the walls-- very small fragments.

96
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,400
This tells us that the
explosive was dense,high-powered.

97
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,650
That doesn't sound homemade.

98
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,930
No. Military grade's my bet,which
means it could be traceable.

99
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,770
These are the most likely sources.

100
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,700
- Check for any recent thefts of missing explosives from any of them.
- All right,will do.

101
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,330
- Got something?
- Yeah.

102
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,390
Lisbon wounded Smith before he escaped.

103
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,710
He's walking around with a bullet.

104
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,960
Oh. Well,hospitals have
to declare gunshot wounds,

105
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,360
so he can't go to an E.R.

106
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,580
Right,so he needs a
doctor who'll keep quiet.

107
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,610
Smith's based here in Sacramento,so I looked
into some of his old cases around town.

108
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:54,350
He was part of a task force that arrested
Dr. Alek Lavrov last year in south Sac.

109
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,120
A Dr. Feelgood writing
illegal oxycontin scripts.

110
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,080
- So?
- So the case went bad,

111
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,030
evidence was lost, and Lavrov walked.

112
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:05,300
So Smith knows exactly where to find a doctor who
won't talk to the cops. Okay,let's go check it out.

113
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,180
<i>It's not what you think.</i>

114
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,210
<i>I'm not Red John.</i>

115
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,630
Patrick,wait. Look.

116
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,230
Welcome back.

117
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,410
Lisbon.

118
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,010
There was an explosion at your house.

119
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,380
How long have I been out?

120
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,600
12 hours.

121
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,190
Reede Smith is Red John.I saw
the tattoo on his shoulder.

122
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,340
He's not the only one.

123
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,160
McAllister has one,too.

124
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,260
He's dead. So are Stiles and Haffner.

125
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,530
- And Bertram.
- Bertram?

126
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,980
He has the tattoo as well.

127
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,370
Oh,my God.

128
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,870
He was just here.

129
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,120
He was standing over you.

130
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,870
He--he was trying to get me
to leave.He was gonna kill you.

131
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,130
Where are my clothes? Slow down,okay?

132
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,460
Just-- No,it's okay.
We don't have time.

133
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,580
Jane. Jane.

134
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,550
Where are my clothes?

135
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,920
This is Teresa Lisbon.

136
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,640
Put out a statewide alert for the
apprehension of Reede Smith and Gail Bertram.

137
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,140
Yes,Director Bertram.

138
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,130
Approach with caution.They're
considered armed and dangerous.

139
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,200
One of them is Red John.

140
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,420
***

141
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,750
- god.
- Move along,ma'am. Police business.

142
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,330
God!

143
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,790
Yes.

144
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,290
The bullet is still inside you.

145
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,710
No crap! Get it out!

146
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,710
This is going to hurt.

147
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,880
Are you sure you won't
take something for the pain?

148
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,180
No...

149
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,390
No. I gotta stay sharp.

150
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,140
As you like.

151
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,820
God!

152
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,710
Tiger,tiger.

153
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,190
Tiger,tiger.

154
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,030
Smith in there?

155
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,030
Yeah. He's screaming his head off.

156
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,130
He won't be a problem.
How you wanna do it?

157
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,170
I just got word from inside CBI.

158
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,750
Couple of agents are coming
here right now looking for Smith.

159
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,390
So what do we do? We hurry.

160
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,890
You go get him. I'll run
interference if CBI shows.

161
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,160
You got it.

162
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,680
Take him out the back. Do it there.

163
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,280
He made me do this.
I'm innocent. Shut up.

164
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,990
I would have called the
police as soon as he left.

165
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,250
I don't want any trouble! Quiet!

166
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,070
You association?

167
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,000
Tiger,tiger. Why didn't you call us?

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,070
Funnily enough, I got trust issues.

169
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,840
Hey,you gotta trust your friends.

170
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,580
I'm here to help you. Can you walk?

171
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,580
I need to sew him up. He'll bleed.

172
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,180
Ah... I can walk.

173
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,530
Detective Cordero,right?

174
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,030
Agent Rigsby.

175
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,480
How are ya?

176
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,950
He's,uh,Sac P.D. worked
the Kirkland shooting.

177
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,370
This is Agent Grace Van Pelt.

178
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,380
What brings you to south Sac?

179
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,210
We're chasing up a lead
on Reede-- Reede Smith.

180
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,950
Looks like we beat you to the punch.

181
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,870
One of my guys is in there
getting him right now.

182
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,220
You want us to cover the back?

183
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,620
No. No,we got it. You sure?

184
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,060
Hey,we might not be CBI,
but we know what we're doing.

185
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,310
Okay. Excuse me.

186
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,810
Yep?

187
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,650
Rigsby,where are you?

188
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,520
Outside the doctor's office.
Looks like Smith's inside.

189
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,990
Are there policemen with you?

190
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,240
Yeah. Why?

191
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,520
Okay,listen carefully.

192
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,020
Do not trust anyone in law enforcement.

193
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,160
Anyone at all. Do you understand?

194
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,690
You got it. Thanks.

195
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,870
Let's,uh,go take a look around back.

196
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,080
Wait a minute.

197
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,120
Car's back this way.

198
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,590
Everything's taken care of.

199
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,380
We got a safe house nearby,
fresh clothes,a doctor...

200
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,490
A trip out of town.

201
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,880
A safe house,huh?

202
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,130
You know,I said that to someone once.

203
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,440
Yeah? What happened after that?

204
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,970
I shot him six times in the back.

205
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,310
Come on.

206
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,700
Damn it.

207
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,860
Drop your weapon!

208
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,890
Stop!

209
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,740
- You all right?
- Yeah! You good?

210
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,910
Yeah.

211
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,500
Smith got away during the
fight.So did the detective.

212
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,370
Boss,they were trying to
kill Smith and us. Why?

213
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,360
I don't know. Check the shoulder.

214
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,010
What?

215
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,590
Ask him to check the left shoulder.

216
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,260
Have Rigsby take his shirt
off and look at his shoulder.

217
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,750
Lisbon wants you to
check his left shoulder.

218
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,940
What the hell?

219
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,440
He's got it. He's got the tattoo.

220
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,270
Boss,what's happening?

221
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,760
All right,bring him in and don't
let anybody else get to him.

222
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,060
Bring him in.

223
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,690
What do we know about
the cop who attacked you?

224
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,550
This is the one we caught.
Officer Paul Wiehagen.

225
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,660
Six years on the
force. Exemplary record,

226
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,420
a couple of commendations,
no real discipline problems.

227
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,370
What about the other
one-- Detective Cordero?

228
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,560
Put a call in to his captain.Said
he called in sick an hour ago.

229
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,310
And still no sign of Bertram.

230
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,630
Let's focus on the one we do have.

231
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,110
Maybe Jane will figure it out.

232
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,870
Did someone send you
to kill Reede Smith?

233
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,060
I got nothing to say.

234
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,590
Why were you gonna murder him?

235
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,000
What about the tattoo? What's it mean?

236
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,190
You're not a big talker. I get it.

237
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,260
Loose lips sink ships and all that.

238
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,100
The bad news is, you
have a lousy poker face.

239
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,110
So we're gonna play a
little game of show-and-tell.

240
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,140
I'm gonna tell you something, and
you're gonna show me with your face

241
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,520
whether I'm right or not.

242
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,380
That sound fun?

243
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,120
You ever steal anything?

244
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,110
Did you ever cheat on your girlfriend?

245
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,570
Hit her?

246
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,160
Do you like causing pain?

247
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,000
I never hit a woman in my life.

248
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,750
Do you belong to a secret organization
of cops and other government officials?

249
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,650
Yes.

250
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:14,650
You've committed crimes on behalf
of that organization before.

251
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,450
Right?

252
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,860
Agent Smith is a member also...

253
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,810
Right?

254
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:30,210
The organization sent you to the
doctor's office to kill him... right?

255
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,830
CBI director Gail
Bertram is also a member.

256
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,410
You don't know.

257
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,170
Too low on the totem pole,huh?

258
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,300
Agent Reede Smith is Red John.

259
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,520
Don't know.

260
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,320
Gail Bertram's Red John.

261
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,950
Don't know.

262
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,460
That tattoo on your shoulder
is the membership sign.

263
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,660
I don't know what you're talking about.

264
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,510
Right again.

265
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,800
There's a password,too--something
you say as a greeting or a...

266
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,490
Distress signal.

267
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,250
"Tiger,tiger".

268
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,360
Get out of my head.

269
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,820
A secret society of dirty cops.

270
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,690
And Red John's a member.

271
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,500
Partridge.

272
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,130
He said "tiger,tiger" to
me right before he died.

273
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,440
Hmm. Yes. Yes.

274
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,400
He was asking for help

275
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,460
in the hopes that you were a member.

276
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,670
But if he had a tattoo,

277
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,430
it would have been
in the autopsy report.

278
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,750
Well,you can't trust a file.

279
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,870
We have to see it.

280
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,910
I'll have Cho track down the body.

281
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,700
But Partridge could be buried by now.

282
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,300
Well,have Cho bring a shovel.

283
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,990
The team's looking for
Smith, Bertram's on the run.

284
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,250
So who's Red John?

285
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,500
Is it Bertram or Smith?

286
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,870
I need to look them both in the eye.

287
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,390
Yeah,the coroner released
his body,like,two days ago.

288
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,520
- Murder victim,huh?
- Yeah.

289
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,730
I figured. That's why
we held him for so long.

290
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,400
Good thing you got here today.

291
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,610
Tomorrow there won't be
much left of him to look at.

292
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,340
Here we go.

293
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,780
Brett .

294
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,330
Give me a hand,huh?

295
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,850
He's all yours.

296
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,470
Give me your knife.

297
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,530
They dress 'em before we burn 'em.

298
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,160
Don't ask me why.

299
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,770
Cho sent a picture.

300
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,340
What does it mean?

301
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,110
What do you think it means?

302
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,620
What happened with Smith?

303
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,520
They almost got him at his doctor's
office.That CBI team showed up.

304
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,230
Smith's in the wind.

305
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,740
That's a good place to be.

306
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,960
I've got some business
in here,so wait for me.

307
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,260
Ah. Thank you,Mr. Thomas.

308
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,670
We haven't seen you for a while.

309
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
Yeah. It's nice to see you.

310
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,480
Smith could be anywhere by now.

311
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,980
I tried to trace the G.P.S.
signal on his cell phone.

312
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,210
It's been dead for hours.

313
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,600
A dirty F.B.I. agent like
him has to have a burner.

314
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,570
Dr. Lavrov says he didn't get
the chance to sew Smith up.

315
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,700
He's still walking around
with a bullet wound.

316
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,590
So he's in a bad way wherever he is.

317
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,230
He'll get picked up
by someone eventually.

318
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,750
Yeah,but any cop who finds him...

319
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,970
This is scary. We can't trust anyone.

320
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,200
Nope.

321
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,630
Agent Van Pelt.

322
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,900
You gotta help me.

323
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,190
Agent Smith.

324
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,950
They're gonna kill me.I wanna surrender.

325
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,260
Where are you?

326
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,680
Downtown. Call Cho. He should be close.

327
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,610
Okay,we're on our way.

328
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,550
Smith reached out to CBI.

329
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,120
He used the burner the
association gave him.

330
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,060
We were listening.

331
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,230
He's turning himself in.

332
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,490
Yeah. Rat.

333
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,610
That CBI team is on
its way to get him now.

334
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,970
Well,we can't have that. Where is he?

335
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,020
He's in an alley not too
far from here. Our good luck.

336
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,120
Does he know who you are?

337
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,040
Nah,he didn't see me
at the doctor's office.

338
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,350
All right. You are now a CBI agent.

339
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,440
You want to come along? Could be fun.

340
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,200
No. I have some other
business to take care of.

341
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,480
- We'll meet up later.
- You got it.

342
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,520
Can you get it right this time?

343
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,070
Yes sir.

344
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,260
Agent Reede Smith?

345
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,430
You out there? Agent Van Pelt sent me.

346
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,470
Who are you?

347
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,410
Agent Oscar Cordero,CBI.

348
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,330
I'm here to take you in.

349
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,820
You gotta keep me safe.

350
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,260
They're everywhere.

351
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,380
Yeah.

352
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,130
We are.

353
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,330
God...

354
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,170
Back of the car now.

355
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,370
You didn't really think you
could get away from us,did you?

356
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,530
You're a big boy. Do me a favor
and get in the trunk yourself.

357
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,470
Just give me a second, will you?

358
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,670
You'll have a second in the trunk.

359
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:57,040
Now don't make me do
painful things to you.

360
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,820
Get in the car!

361
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,460
I'm gonna need a deal. Full immunity.

362
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,030
I'm not saying a word unless I can walk.

363
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,030
So walk.

364
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,750
What?

365
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,250
Get up off your ass and walk.

366
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,670
But,hey,good luck getting out of the building
before your friends catch up with you.

367
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,740
If you tell us everything
we need to know,

368
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:40,410
I promise we will put you in a federal
prison far away from California.

369
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,000
Someplace that you'll be safe.

370
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,260
Five years ago, I hurt my back.

371
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,700
I was helping my cousin
move a stupid couch.

372
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,480
Doctor gave me some pain pills.

373
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,230
Turns out I liked them.

374
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,370
I got hooked before I even
knew what was happening.

375
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,210
So?

376
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,660
So...

377
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:11,050
I'm chasing a gangbanger down an alley
in Carson Springs, and I'm out of it.

378
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,830
I mean,way out of it.

379
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,420
I thought--I thought
I was being followed.

380
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,810
I shot a little girl.

381
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,260
A 12-year-old
girl.

382
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,730
Local cops took my blood.

383
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,600
They had witnesses. They had me cold.

384
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:39,300
And then this detective,he reaches out to
me and he says they can make it all go away.

385
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,520
And they did.

386
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,190
The blood tests, the
witnesses--all of it?

387
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,390
Hell,when they got done fixing it,

388
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,830
the F.B.I. gave me a medal.

389
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,990
And exactly who are "they"?

390
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:59,010
We call ourselves the Blake Association.

391
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:00,930
Why?

392
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,000
"Tiger,tiger."

393
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,520
"Tyger,tyger burning bright""

394
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,190
from the poem by Blake.

395
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,140
Someone's a big fan of his, I guess.

396
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,940
Well,who else is in the association?

397
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,230
Cops,judges,F.B.I. agents.

398
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,180
Anyone in law enforcement
that needs a secret covered up.

399
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,680
Like your drug habit.

400
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,190
You need a favor, you ask for it.

401
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,020
You get asked to do
something, you do it.

402
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,710
"Tiger,tiger."

403
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,880
Yep.

404
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,700
Well,is there somebody who's in charge?

405
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,550
Must be.

406
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,970
But I don't know who.

407
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,390
I just know my little group. That's it.

408
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:47,560
But I'm guessing there must be
hundreds of us, maybe thousands.

409
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,390
And nobody knows about it?

410
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,060
Bob Kirkland knew about it, didn't he?

411
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,150
Go ahead,just say it. Unburden yourself.

412
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,820
Yeah.

413
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,530
He knew too much.

414
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,860
So I killed him.

415
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,950
Do you know that Red John's a
member of the Blake Association?

416
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,510
Are you sure?

417
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,680
Red John had a follower.

418
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,550
Rebecca Anderson.

419
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:33,390
Killed some of your guys
about four years ago.

420
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,470
Yeah,Sam Bosco and his team.

421
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,560
Them.

422
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,890
Someone asked me to
get F.B.I. credentials

423
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,400
so that they could access CBI.

424
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:50,100
Red John or someone who worked for him
snuck into the CBI and poisoned Rebecca.

425
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,960
And you helped them?

426
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,380
I mean,that's when I knew.

427
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,580
I'd--I'd done a favor
for a serial killer.

428
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,130
Who asked you to get the credentials?

429
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,880
I don't know. It was a phone call.

430
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,940
That's the way the association works.

431
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,340
You never know.

432
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,740
You...

433
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,460
You're gonna be able
to keep me safe,right?

434
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,930
That depends.

435
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,150
Did you murder my wife and daughter?

436
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,470
I did not murder your wife and daughter.

437
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,980
I swear on my mother.

438
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,590
Do you believe him?

439
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,990
He confessed to murder.

440
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,340
Red John would never break
like that,not even as an act.

441
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,290
- Well,if Smith isn't Red John...
- That means we have work to do.

442
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,680
And we need help. Who took
over from Brenda Shettrick?

443
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,300
In media relations? Why?

444
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,980
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

445
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,550
We have CBI consultant
Patrick Jane here,

446
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,810
who is here to report a
development in the Red John case.

447
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,530
Thank you.

448
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,310
Ten years ago,

449
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:09,180
the serial killer known as Red
John killed my wife and daughter.

450
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:13,320
Uh,we've been hunting
him diligently ever since.

451
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:19,540
Today we're pleased to announce that
we--we finally have a name,a face.

452
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:24,420
The director of the division of law
enforcement,Gail Bertram,is Red John.

453
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,700
He's armed and dangerous.

454
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,800
If you see him, do not approach him.

455
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:34,090
Call the California Bureau
of Investigation at once.

456
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,590
Thank you.

457
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,390
One question at a time.

458
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,910
Excuse me mam.

459
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,580
So are we gonna talk about this?

460
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,920
Talk about what?

461
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,620
Bertram is Red John.

462
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,760
Looks like.

463
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,380
And if Jane finds him,
he's gonna kill him.

464
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,340
Yeah.

465
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,930
And we're good with
that? Killing the boss?

466
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,180
I am.

467
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,430
Yeah.

468
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,180
Okay.

469
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,170
Just as long as we're on the same page.

470
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,050
It's just weird,is all.

471
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,070
Does Bertram smoke?

472
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,520
No,I don't think so.

473
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,740
People get them as gifts sometimes.

474
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,130
Van Pelt.

475
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,160
A flash drive.Let's take a look.

476
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,050
There's only one file on the drive.

477
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,250
It's password-protected.

478
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,780
I'll have to brute-force it.

479
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,230
Cool. I've been wanting
to use my new F.P.G.A.

480
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,140
Your what?

481
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,720
Trust me, don't ask.

482
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,570
And...

483
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,210
We're in.

484
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,060
Crap.

485
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,330
It looks like a list.

486
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,580
Names,maybe? Can you decode it?

487
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,230
I can try a few things...

488
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,030
but decoding is Jane's department.

489
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,370
I'll send it to him.

490
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,240
Here you go. This one
isn't messing around.

491
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,840
Lots of peat.

492
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,350
Yeah,that's pretty good.
Can you put some rocks in it?

493
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,690
Are you sure? This is some fine scotch.

494
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,310
Yeah,I'm sure.

495
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,420
**

496
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,860
I need a ride.

497
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,620
We're en route to the bar now.

498
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,370
Highway patrol shut down the freeways,

499
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,870
so if he runs,we've got
him, but what if he hides?

500
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,210
Bertram killed the
bartender in Citrus Heights.

501
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,620
He's got an aunt with a house there.

502
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,130
You think that's where he is?

503
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:01,710
She moved into a retirement home about
six months ago,so her place is empty now.

504
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,960
Sounds like a good place
to hide. What's the address?

505
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,920
1408 Rosemary Street.

506
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,370
We're on our way. Get Cho and R.R.T.
there now,and let the choppers know.

507
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,440
- Is he here?
- He's in there.

508
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,890
I got Karl and a few guys in the back.

509
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,410
- He's not going anywhere.
- Do we trust them?

510
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,490
I asked to see their
shoulders and their tattoos.

511
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,680
What are you doing here? I
didn't call Sac P.D. S.W.A.T.

512
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,950
Well,someone asked for us.

513
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,870
Let's set up a command
center right here!

514
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,020
Listen,everybody, I'm in charge!

515
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,850
That district's that's way across
town. What the hell is going on?

516
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:51,060
He did it. He called them in.

517
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,750
Well,why would Bertram call
S.W.A.T. to his own location?

518
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,520
He didn't call in one S.W.A.T. team.

519
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,680
He called all of them in.

520
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,020
This is a madhouse.

521
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,940
There's a whole 'nother
unit setting up out back.

522
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,310
We've lost control of the scene,boss.

523
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,140
He's one of them.
Bertram is one of them.

524
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,530
He's getting away.
We gotta shut it down.

525
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,120
Nobody leaves!

526
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,620
No one leaves!

527
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,190
You're clear.

528
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,360
Yeah...

529
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,170
I need something to eat.

530
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:03,030
How about Chinese? I know a great place.

531
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,700
Yeah,sounds good.

532
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,380
They found Bertram's
clothes inside the house.

533
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,160
Looks like someone planted
a S.W.A.T. team outfit

534
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,800
in the house before he got there.

535
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,300
And then called every S.W.A.T.
and R.R.T. in the area.

536
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,330
Any leads about who
made all those calls?

537
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,970
Somebody who could pull
a lot of strings at once.

538
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:24,340
Blake Association.

539
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,020
Boss.

540
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,340
May I have your attention, please?

541
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,530
Put down your phones and
step away from your desks.

542
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,860
Now.

543
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:36,320
I'm Special Agent in
charge Teresa Lisbon.

544
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,570
Who the hell are you?

545
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,620
F.B.I. supervisory Agent Dennis Abbott.

546
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:47,790
Now I repeat,stand up and
stand away from your desks...

547
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,050
Please.

548
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:52,380
We're in the middle of a
manhunt for a dangerous fugitive.

549
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,330
Now if you would
like to assist--

550
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:59,510
The head of this alleged law
enforcement organization is a murderer,

551
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:02,180
and a member of a massive
criminal conspiracy.

552
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,260
Which included F.B.I. agents.

553
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,270
Yes,and that's why the bureau sent
me here from the Austin,Texas, office.

554
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,770
To clean up the mess.

555
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:20,860
I am holding in my hand a
writ from a federal judge.

556
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,690
The F.B.I.'s closing down
your organization right now.

557
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:30,370
All of you are relieved
from your active duties

558
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,670
as of this moment.

559
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,960
You can't do that.

560
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,380
I'm here to collect evidence.

561
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,080
Don't get in my way.

562
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,080
Let's go to work,fellas.

563
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,620
What's going on here?

564
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,630
***

565
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:07,940
Dennis Abbott,F.B.I.
you must be Patrick Jane.

566
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,110
They've shut us down.

567
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,960
We're gonna need to
interview you at some point,

568
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,080
but it can wait. We're
gonna be here for some time.

569
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,780
Just don't leave town.

570
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,630
We have a killer to catch.

571
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,590
Oh,well, that's our problem now.

572
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,290
You had your chance to
catch him and you blew it--

573
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,890
if you were really trying.

574
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,020
That was my favorite cup.

575
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,160
Yeah.

576
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,330
Okay,well,you see in the funny pages.

577
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,980
What now?

578
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,320
I don't know.

579
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,320
Van Pelt found some coded
files in Bertram's flash drive.

580
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,160
Should we get started on those?

581
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,920
No,it's a waste of time. We're done.

582
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,840
There's nothing more to do here.

583
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,510
Just go home, get some rest.

584
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,880
You're not quitting. I don't believe it.

585
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,140
No,I'm not quitting.

586
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,890
I'm letting go.

587
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,190
It's out of our hands for now.

588
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,780
But I'll be in touch. Okay?

589
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,060
