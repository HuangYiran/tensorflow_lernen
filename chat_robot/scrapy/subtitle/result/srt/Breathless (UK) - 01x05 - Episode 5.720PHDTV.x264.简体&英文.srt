1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,060
我一直努力想无视我的感受  但我做不到
All I want to do is stop feeling
what I'm feeling, but I can't,

2
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,060
前情提要

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,000
我不知道该如何是好
and I.. do not know what to do any more.

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,060
幕雨字幕组译制

5
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,080
我只想留在你身旁  仅此而已
I just want to be near you,nothing more.

7
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,520
这里发生的一切都与爱情无关  知道吗
What happens here has got nothing to do with love, all right?

00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,240
从哪回来的就回哪儿去  之前做什么就继续做去
Go back to wherever it is you go.
Keep doing whatever you're doing.

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,620
我爱你  但是我不能再继续没有爱的生活
I love you but I can't live without...love.

11
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,300
情况严重吗
It's that serious?

12
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,320
做个活细胞组织检查  我就能了解更多
The tests, the biopsy,should tell me more.

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,300
我并不想伤害你
I don't want to hurt you.

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,400
给我你的陈词跟照片
Let me have the statements and the photographs.

15
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,320
- 但我要是给了你的话我就会失去你  - 求你了
- But I'll lose you if I give them to you.- Please!

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,500
这就是正在将年轻的波尔赛弗捏拉进
So, here we have Hades seizing the beautiful young Persephone,

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,480
死亡的国度-冥府的哈迪斯
dragging her down to the realm of the dead.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,460
或许你们有人早已对以描绘蹂躏
Some of you may be familiar with the celebrated Bernini sculpture,

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,520
而享誉世界的雕塑家贝尔尼尼非常熟悉
which depicts the same rape,

20
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,420
尽管他比你们早生了八十年
although it predates this by some 80 years.

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,420
- 抱歉  - 不不  没关系的
- Sorry. - No, no, it's fine.

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,420
现在才开始呢
It's only just begun.

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,500
希望我不会被训斥
Hope I don't get told off.

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,160
真好玩啊
What fun!

25
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,520
我们也不能对残暴的老哈迪斯过于苛刻
We mustn't be too harsh on fierce old Hades.

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,560
毕竟他还是让她做了个可靠的女人
After all, he did make an honest woman of her.

27
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,600
她最后成为了冥后
She became Queen of the Underworld.

28
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,540
- 我来帮您提包  - 不不  不劳烦了
- Can I get your bags? - No, no, no.

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,600
- 我可不像看起来那样弱不禁风  - 那再见了  夫人
- I'm stronger than I look. - Ma'am.

30
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,500
在这边  鲍威尔先生
In here, Mr Powell.

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,500
你打算什么时候给我做手术
So...when do you cut me open?

32
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,500
明天一早
First thing tomorrow.

33
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,520
非常好
Splendid.

34
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,520
屏息

35
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,520
第一季第五集

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,420
这个大鸟笼是由一位不知名的建筑家设计的
The aviary, which was designed by an unknown architect,

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,580
一直到一九八九年才竣工
was finally completed in 1889.

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
是因为太热了才不能赶工的
Far too hot to hurry.

39
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,540
当巴伦住在这里时  经常到这里来喂鸟儿食
Whenever the Baron was in residence,
he used to come here to feed the birds.

40
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,540
据说这里的鸟儿都已经认得出他的声音了呢
We're told the birds actually recognised his voice.

41
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,500
我们先进去歇会儿吧
We'll just step in here.

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,500
鲍威尔夫人
Mrs Powell.

43
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,420
真是意外之喜啊
What a surprise.

44
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,600
穆里根先生
Mr Mulligan.

45
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,600
我是安德伯雷太太
Mrs Enderbury.

46
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,560
安德伯雷太太  哦~
Mrs Enderbury? Oh.

47
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,520
真迷人
Enchanted.

48
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,480
真是太巧了  对吧
Marvellous, isn't it?

49
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,420
你觉得鸟儿快乐吗
Do you think the birds are happy?

50
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,520
我觉得它们很快乐  你看它们不是都在歌唱吗
I'd say they are. They're singing, anyway.

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,400
你对园艺感兴趣吗  穆里根先生
Are you interested in gardening,Mr Mulligan?

52
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,540
真是多此一问
Silly question.

53
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,540
你肯定对园艺很感兴趣  不然你也不会到这儿来了
You must be, or you wouldn't be here.

54
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,540
哦~  我们得走了
Oh, hold on tight, we're moving.

55
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,440
你先去吧  莉莉  我有些私事要跟穆里根先生聊
You go ahead, Lily. I just want a private word with Mr Mulligan.

56
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,540
你跑这里来干嘛
What are you doing here?

57
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,440
我们现在情况很不利
We got off on the wrong foot.

58
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,540
你答应要把文件给我的
You promised me the files.

59
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,460
你逼我跟你...做那种事
You forced me to let you...do what you did.

60
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,460
然后你就会闭口不言
And then didn't keep your word.

61
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,600
- 我并不引以为傲  - 谎言还是淫行
- I'm not proud of that. - The lie or the rape?

62
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,600
不要这样  不是那样的  别那样叫  求你了
Please.It wasn't that,don't call it that.Please.

63
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,420
我来这儿是想问你...
I'm here to ask you...

64
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,420
是想乞求你把那件事抛诸脑后
to beg you, to put all that behind us.

65
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,440
这样我们就能够重新开始
So we can start again.

66
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
根本就没有什么文件
There are no files.

67
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,480
你什么把柄都没有
You had nothing.

68
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,500
非常荣幸能认识你的朋友
Very pleased to meet your friend.

69
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,520
查尔斯・安德伯雷太太
Mrs Charles Enderbury.

70
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,480
你丈夫的共犯
Your husband's accomplice?

71
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,380
他好像人...还挺友善的...
He seemed um...very nice...

72
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,620
你的那个神秘先生
your mysterious man.

73
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,520
住口
Shut up.

74
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,580
抱歉
Sorry.

75
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,440
莉莉  这非常重要  你绝对不可以向任何人提到他
Lily, please, really, it's so important. You mustn't mention him to anyone.

76
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,420
- 即使是奥托跟查理  - 好吧
- Not Otto, not Charlie. - All right.

77
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,520
尤其是查理  你能答应我吗
Especially not Charlie. Do you promise?

78
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,500
很好
Good.

79
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,440
谢谢
Thank you.

80
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,460
我们不能再谈这件事
We need never refer to it again.

81
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,520
好了
Right.

82
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,480
我们得跟上观光团了
Better catch up with the tour.

83
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,900
- 今天真闷啊  - 对啊  谁说不是呢
- Stifling today. - Yes, isn't it?

84
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
我现在恨不得吃一大块冰块
I'd kill for an ice.

85
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,400
你现在可没时间穿比基尼
You'll be wearing a bikini in no time.

86
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,420
- 好了  各位  我们走吧  - 特拉斯科特医生
- Right,chaps,on we go. - Dr Truscott?

87
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,640
能小聊两句吗
Quick word?

88
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
休息一会儿  各位
Stand easy, chaps.

89
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,440
我觉得该告知你一声  玛格丽特・道尔顿在私人病房
Thought I should let you know. Margaret Dalton's here, in a private room.

90
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,480
什么
What?

91
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,620
玛格丽特上周过来找我
Margaret came to see me last week.

92
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
说她腹部阵痛  食欲不振
Abdominal pain, loss of appetite...

93
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
房事之后还出血
some bleeding after sex.

94
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,540
你不想知道这事儿吗
You weren't aware of that?

95
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,480
你给她检查过了吗
You examined her?

96
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
送过样本给实验室了
And sent a smear to the lab.

97
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,520
她患上了宫颈癌
She has cervical cancer.

98
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,500
很抱歉告诉你这个坏消息
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

99
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,440
不  别开玩笑了  我跟她不怎么熟
No, don't be ridiculous. I barely know her.

100
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,460
我明天就给她做手术
I'm operating tomorrow.

101
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,560
好吧  要只是宫颈的问题  倾刻间就能解决
Right, well, if it's just the cervix, we can whip it out in a trice.

102
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,580
要是扩散了的话  摘除子宫就行了
If it's spread, hysterectomy.

103
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,480
嗯  到时候再说吧
Yes, we'll see.

104
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,420
介意让我一个人坐电梯上去吗
Mind if I come along for the ride?

105
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,460
- 不介意  - 很好
- Not at all. - Excellent.

106
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,520
- 很高兴在这儿遇到你  - 嗯
- Fancy meeting you here. - Yes.

107
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,540
毕竟我是这个医院的医生嘛
A doctor in a hospital.

108
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,440
真诡异
Bizarre.

109
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,500
我上周给你公寓那边打过几通电话
I phoned you last week a couple of
times, called round at the flat...

110
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
我一直在避免接触他人
I've been rather incommunicado.

111
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,420
不好意思
Sorry.

112
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,520
不用道歉
No.

113
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
我理解
No, understood.

114
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,400
那...
So, er...

115
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,460
- 鲍威尔对你治疗得还好吗  - 当然
- Powell been treating you all right? - Mm.

116
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
那个自负的混蛋
Conceited bastard.

117
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,180
自以为是伦敦地区最好的妇科医生
Thinks he's the best gynae surgeon in London.

118
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,440
但是我告诉你个小秘密
But I'll let you into a little secret.

119
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,460
他确实是
He is.

120
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,400
那我不是很幸运地会安然无恙吗
Well,aren't I the lucky one,landing on my feet?

121
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,600
梅塔明天会替我  我明天那时候有个约会
Mehta will cover for me tomorrow,I've got an appointment.

122
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,020
知道了
Fine.

123
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,440
好吧  其实我是要去找份别的工作
Yes. No, it's about another job.

124
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,580
是在圣奥尔本医院一个部门主管职位
At St Albans - head of department.

125
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
- 哦  太好了  - 对
- Oh, terrific. - Yes.

126
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,420
很抱歉如此唐突地告诉你
Sorry to spring it on you.

127
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,400
他们上周打过电话过来
They got in touch last week...

128
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,620
说想要我推荐个人过去
wanted a reference.

129
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,580
- 你怎么都没跟我提  - 你也没先跟我提这事儿啊
- You didn't mention it. - You didn't mention it.

130
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,400
我是没有
No.

131
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,420
我担心会让你陷入尴尬的境地
I'm worried about leaving you in the lurch.

132
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,400
不必担心  老兄  我早已另有人选了
No,don't,old chap.I can always get someone else.

133
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,600
- 那我们揽的私活呢  - 也有人选了
- What about the Specials? - Yes, those too.

134
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,600
说实在的  查理
Honestly, Charlie.

135
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,640
这是你的生活  你的事业  去吧
It's your life, your career. Please.

136
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,520
去追求你的理想
Pursue it.

137
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440

谢了  老兄

139
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,480
对了
Oh...

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,560
祝你超好运

141
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
奥利弗的父亲是怎么死的
How did Oliver's father die?

142
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,500
我不记得书里怎么讲的了
I don't remember in the book.

143
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,440
可能是他们来让我们去看演出了
They may tell us in the show.

144
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,540
- 夫人  - 谢谢

145

给鲍威尔夫人  维布鲁克大街  圣玛格丽特（检察长送）

146
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,960
明天下午三点  里士满  蓝普顿船坞

147
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560

148
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,500
- 要我把它们插起来吗  - 扔掉

00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,580
我可不想成为孤儿
I shouldn't like to be an orphan.

151
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,620
你不会成孤儿的
Well, you won't be one.

152
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,480
我们要见爸爸的话你就得快点了
We'll need to hurry if we're meeting Daddy.

153
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,480
护士  走之前你能帮我把贝克夫人的笔记拿过来一下吗
Before you go,Nurse,could you fetch
Mrs Baker's notes?

154
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,620
护士
Nurse?

155
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,400

我们应该...
We should...

159
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,440
我们确实应该
We should.

160
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,540
谈谈  或是...
..just talk or...

161
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,540
我们先出去吧
Let's get out of here.

169
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,560
你兴奋吗
Are you excited?

170
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,500
我也是
Me too.

171
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,160
你要起床了吗
Are you getting up?

172
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,160
抱歉
Sorry.

173
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,180
我睡不着
Can't sleep.

174
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,160
我也睡不着
Me neither.

175
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,040
出什么事儿了吗
What's the problem?

176
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,240
没事儿
Nothing.

177
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
什么事儿也没有
Nothing, nothing at all.

178
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,140
不想扫了你的兴
Don't want to bore you with it.

179
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,200
谁啊
Who's that?

180
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
是我  老爸
It's me, Dad.

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,980
你好  简
Hello, Jean.

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
我刚起床正在房间里看书呢
Just been up reading in my bedroom.

183
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,020
- 你继续看吧  小莫  - 吉妮
- You just carry on, Mo. - Jeannie.

184
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,180
你怎么跟个笨蛋似的站在那儿
What are you standing there for,like a lemon?

185
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
过来坐会儿吧
Come and sit down.

186
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,180
- 我才不是笨蛋呢  - 先坐下再说
- I'm not a lemon. - Sit yourself down.

187
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,120
你妹妹还在医院上班呢
Your sister's at work at the hospital.

188
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,680
你今天气色不错  老爸
You seem well today, Dad.

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,180
我身体一直都好得很呢
I'm always well.

190
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,080
一直都是
Always well.

191
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,160
你呢
And you?

192
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
当然也很好
Yeah. I'm fine.

193
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,220
喝茶吗
Cup of tea?

194
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,660
你有没有...
Did you ever...

195
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,100
爱过除妈妈之外的
love anyone else...

196
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,220
其他人
..apart from Mum?

197
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,100
没有
No.

198
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,120
我只爱过她一人
Always her.

199
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
从我们第一支舞开始就只爱着她
From the first dance.

200
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,680
你真幸运
You were lucky.

201
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,600
她也是
And so was she.

202
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,620
你也会同样幸运的
And you will be too.

203
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,800
别担心了
Don't you worry.

204
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
我陪你到走廊走走
I'll walk you down the aisle.

205
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,840
你不介意我去对吧  我不想束缚到你的发挥
You don't mind me coming, do you?
I don't want to cramp your style.

206
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,760
你看起来...简直是太美了
You look...terrific.

207
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,780
查理  邻居们都看着呢
Charlie, the neighbours!

208
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,680
- 去他的邻居们  - 查理（娇笑中）
- Damn the neighbours. - Charlie! (GIGGLES)

209
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
感觉我们就是在冒险一样
It's like we're on an adventure.

210
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
不好意思  你现在不能饮食
Sorry, you can't eat or drink.

211
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,700
带火了吗
Got a light?

212
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
终于看到你的另一面了
See you on the other side.

213
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,680
老朋友了
Old friends.

214
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,780
奥托：准备开第一刀
OTTO: First incision.

215
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
- 梅塔医生  - 请继续吧
- Dr Mehta? - Please proceed.

216
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,680
我会代替安德伯雷医生在旁边协助你的
I am a cumbersome stand-in for Dr Enderbury.

217
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,640
没别的意思
Not at all.

218
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,620
他是个可靠的副手
A trusty lieutenant.

219
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,820
我觉得你跟他都无需多言  点个头眨下眼他就明白了
I imagine you barely need to speak, just a nod and a wink.

220
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
- 我俩亲密无间  - 确实
- Thick as thieves. - Indeed.

221
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,820
你们是在哪儿认识的
And where was your alliance forged?

222
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,780
陆军医务队  你介意我们能先不聊天吗
Army Medical Corps. Do you mind awfully if we don't chat?

223
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,720
一点也不
Not at all.

224
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,820
我也不想干扰到你
I wouldn't want to unsettle you.

225
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
- 不是吗  - 当然
- No? - Of course not.

226
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
我不说了
Perish the thought.

227
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,820
安德伯雷先生
Dr Enderbury?

228
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
我是沃尔顿  欢迎
Watson. Welcome.

229
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,780
荣幸之至
Pleasure.

230
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,319
计划有点小变动  索姆斯先生现在
Slight change of plan,Mr Soames is tied up in

231
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,620
正在做一场紧急外科手术  那可是疑难杂症
emergency surgery - unexpected complications.

232
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,800
啊  老难杂了
Ah, the old UC.

233
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,440
- 就是“疑难杂症”  - 哦  我知道
- Unexpected complications. - Ah, yes.

234
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,620
那我先带你逛逛这儿吧
So, let me give you  a tour of the ship,

235
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,820
你吃完午饭之后
and after you've had a break for lunch,

236
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,660
我们两点钟再在这儿见面如何
could we reconvene here at two?

237
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,660
没问题
Fine.

238
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,820
谢谢
Thank you.

239
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,840
索姆斯先生迫不及待的想见到你呢
Mr Soames is eager to meet you.

240
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,800
我们已经很久没见过如此热情的推荐函了
We've seldom seen such glowing references.

241
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,739
不敢相信你你所听到的了吗
Can't believe everything you hear?

242
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,740
他们说你非常谦虚
They said you were modest.

243
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,700
也没那么谦虚啦
Not that modest.

244
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,720
我们先四处看看吧
Let's go and look at it.

245
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,780
癌细胞已经扩散到骨盆跟腺体
Carcinoma widespread -pelvis, glands.

246
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:51,500
天呐
Jesus Christ.

247
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:54,760
我们可以摘除卵巢  宫颈跟子宫
We can take out the ovaries,the cervix and uterus.

248
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,720
但是癌细胞扩散太快  已经没办法阻止了
But the cancer's rampant.We can't cut it all out.

249
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,780
我们必...必须得试试
We have... We have to try.

250
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,760
不行  我们不能这样做
No, we don't.

251
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,660
因为  我再重申一遍  已经回天乏术了
Because, I repeat, it's not possible.

252
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,700
要是你不做的话  我来
If you won't, I will.

253
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,620
- 你再说一遍  - 要是我不试试的话她会死的
- I beg your pardon? - She'll die if I don't.

254
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,640
你要是这样做的话她立马会死
She'll die now if you do.

255
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
她是我的病人  特拉斯科特先生
She's my patient, Mr Truscott.

256
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
我不能让你杀了她
I can't allow you to kill her.

257
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,720
天气真好啊
Lovely day.

258
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,640
她待会儿就会恢复神智
She'll be conscious in a minute.

259
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
必须有人得告诉她这个噩耗
Someone has to tell her.

260
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,680
我不确定是否能胜任这项任务
Not sure I'm up to that.

261
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,760
你绝对可以
You are.

262
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,840
而且你也会去的
You will be.

263
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,680
感觉如何
How are you feeling?

264
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,620
头昏脑胀的
Bit woozy.

265
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
杜松子酒喝多了吧
Too many G&Ts.

266
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,680
一切都还顺利吗
So, everything OK?

267
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,620
我们已经...
There's noth...

268
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,680
我们已经无能为力了
There's nothing we can do.

269
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,820
你六个月之前肯定就已经知道了
You must have known six months ago,
some pain...which you ignored,

270
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,680
但是因为你很坚强  那么...完美无瑕
because you're so...independent,so...

271
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,600
所以你才忽略了那些疼痛
..so flawless.

272
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,640
我本应该注意到的 我本应该看出来的  但我没...
I should have noticed,I should have seen but I could...

273
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,720
而我没有  因为我从来都没想到你会出什么事
..I couldn't,because I could never imagine anything wrong with you.

274
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
对此我深表感激
I'm very grateful for that.

275
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
你就别再自责了
Please don't blame yourself.

276
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,660
到这来
Come here.

277
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,660
到我这儿来
Come here.

278
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,720
快来
Come.

279
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,800
【叹息】
(SIGHS)

280
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
我还有多少时日  几个月
How long have I got? Months?

281
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,640
几周
Weeks?

282
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,840
或许吧
Maybe.

283
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,700
猜猜是谁
Guess who?

284
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,840
查理
Charlie!

285
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,740
外科医生还在手术室呢
The surgeon was in theatre.

286
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,740
一小时之后才会回去
Got to be back in an hour.

287
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,700
这个小镇太美了  查理
It's such a lovely town, Charlie.

288
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,780
我看到有做很不错的房子在出售
I saw a darling little house for sale.

289
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
就等着我们去住呢
It's all there for the taking.

290
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
那我们这一小时能做点什么呢
So, what can we do with an hour?

291
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,820
天呐
Gosh!

292
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,840
史...密...斯
S-M-I-T-H.

293
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,660
没有行李
No luggage.

294
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,640
走吧  史密斯太太  我们时间不多哦
Come on, Mrs Smith, we haven't got all day.

295
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,660
这艘船还不错  对吧  还能在敦克尔克接活儿呢
Not a bad little boat, is she? Could've done a job at Dunkirk.

296
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,720
你就让我来看这个
Is this what you've brought me to see?

297
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,740
我这些天来就是把那些东西藏这儿的
This is where I've kept them in recent weeks.

298
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,660
什么东西
Kept what?

299
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,760
那些文件
The files.

300
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,700
看一下吧
Take a peek.

301
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,780
你知道这些事谁的  对吧
You know whose it is, don't you?

302
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
还有我发现它的地方
And where I found it.

303
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
那个死去的男人血迹斑斑的鞋
The dead man's blood-stained shoe.

304
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,900
这些证据就足以使鲍威尔跟安德伯雷俩人都锒铛入狱
Proof, if proof were needed, to convict both Powell and Enderbury.

305
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,820
不  你留着吧  请自便
No, keep it, feel free.

306
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,780
好时刻都提醒着你
A reminder.

307
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,780
这儿还有很多照片跟陈词之类的
There's more here-photos,statements,et cetera.

308
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,680
你见不到这艘船对她来说最好
You're not seeing her at her best.

309
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,240
我们过去一直都让她停在这小河上并保持着整洁
We used to keep her spick and span.

310
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,660
斯图尔特他会帮我打理着这船
He'd help me, Stewart would.

311
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,760
我的儿子
My son.

312
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,760
他当时多大
How old was he?

313
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,600
九岁
Nine.

314
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,600
他总借着水闸的水在河上飘荡
He was upriver in this boat in a lock.

315
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
他喜欢水闸...
He liked the locks...

316
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,840
水流倾泻而出  而我们就在水面上漂流
water pouring in,lifting us slowly up.

317
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,820
我妻子跟女儿总在我跟水闸看守员聊天时在小屋里做些三明治
My wife and daughter were in the cabin making
sandwiches, I was chatting to the lock-keeper.

318
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,720
我听见斯图尔特开怀大笑着
I heard Stewart laughing.

319
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,760
他不停地喊着：“爸爸  爸爸”
He called, 'Dad, Dad!'

320
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,820
我以为他看到什么东西了
I thought he must've seen something.

321
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,600
但你绝对不会去打扰你的父亲
But you don't interrupt your father.

322
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,640
你绝对不会在他跟别人聊天时打断他的
You don't interrupt your father when he's talking, do you?

323
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,740
对吧
Do you?

324
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,840
不能哭  罗纳尔德  不能哭
Stop it, Ronald, stop it.

325
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
我没听见他进河里去了
I didn't hear him go in.

326
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,820
- 他溺水了吗  - 他溺水了
- He drowned? - He drowned.

327
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,800
我们让水排出了闸门之后才发现他
We let the water out of the lock and found him.

328
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,660
上一秒还开怀大笑着...
One moment you're laughing...

329
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
下一秒这个人却没了
the next you disappear.

330
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,620
我的心自此之后就停止了跳动
And my heart stopped...

331
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,720
直到我再次遇到了你
..until I saw you again.

332
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,820
再次
Again?

333
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,660
我还没告诉你我第一次见你的时候
I haven't told you about the first time.

334
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,800
那天天气热得很  塞浦路斯的阳光炙烤着大地
It was a baking day,the Cypriot sun beating down.

335
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,760
我走进那所黑色庄严的修道院医院
I came into the cool dark of a convent hospital.

336
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,720
走进一个像礼堂一样没有任何家具的房间
A bare room...like a chapel.

337
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,840
阳光从高高的窗户中射进来
Light from a high window.

338
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,760
还有一张床
And a bed.

339
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,800
在那张床上  躺着一个昏迷的女人
And in that bed, a woman lay, unconscious.

340
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,780
我看着她...
I looked at her...

341
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
几乎无法呼吸
..and I could hardly breathe.

342
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,720
就仿佛当时的阳光就是为她而闪耀
It was as if the light,somehow,was shining from her.

343
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,820
那是我此生见过最美的场景
You were the most beautiful sight I'd ever seen.

344
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,720
你现在依然还是
You still are.

345
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,600
你应该想想你的妻子
You should think about your wife...

346
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,600
你的女儿
your daughter.

347
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,700
不
No.

348
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,620
我只想要你
I just want you.

349
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,760
你跟托马斯
You and Thomas.

350
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,780
你不能拥有托马斯
You can't have Thomas!

351
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,620
你或许可以拥有我  但是你绝不能拥有托马斯
You may have had me but you can never have Thomas.

352
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,760
绝对不行
Never.

353
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,840
我不想用这个的  伊丽莎白
I don't want to use it, Elizabeth.

354
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,760
那就信守点承诺  别用那个  检察长
Then restore some honour,Inspector,and don't.

355
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,640
你愿意屈尊跟我周五一起去看《甜蜜的生活》吗
Would you deign to come and see La Dolce Vita, Friday?

356
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,640
（《甜蜜的生活》1960年意大利电影）

357
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,840
- 从没听过  - 其他电影也行  随便你选
- Never heard of it.- Or another film, any film.

358
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,840
呃...
Erm...

359
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,640
- 我会屈尊前往的  - 谢谢
- I'll deign to. - Thank you.

360
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,660
天呐  我终于又开始有心跳了
God, my heart's started beating again.

361
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,740
科恩  貌似你把你的学伴给弄丢了
Cohen,you seem to have lost your fellow students.

362
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,840
是的  鲍威尔先生  我马上去加入他们
Yes, Mr Powell, just rejoining them now.

363
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,600
昨天的事儿我很抱歉
I'm sorry about yesterday.

364
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,840
- 我感觉糟透了  - 我也是
- I...I felt awful. - So did I.

365
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,680
- 时机不对  - 时机不对
- Bad timing. - Bad timing.

366
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,700
- 奥托  - 有工作给你
- Otto? - Job for you.

367
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,780
私诊病人  上白班  这是她的地址
Private patient.Day shift.Here's her address.

368
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,800
谁跟你说我想要工作了
And who said I wanted a job?

369
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,760
她因为宫颈癌快要去世了  急需一个护士护理
She's dying.Cervical cancer.Needs a nurse.

370
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,640
- 我是个家庭主妇  - 不 你不是
- I'm a housewife. - No, you're not.

371
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
晚安
Good night.

372
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,260
我们走了的话肯定会很想你的  但你一定得过来看我们
Of course we'll miss you when we're gone but you must come and see us.

373
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,280
还有大教堂  我跟你说过大教堂吗
And the cathedral.Did I say there was a cathedral?

374
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,200
两只交叉
Oh. Well, fingers crossed.

375
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,420
去一个没人认识的新地方肯定非常棒
Mm.Must be so nice to go somewhere new where nobody knows you.

376
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,280
就带着托马斯一个人重新开始
Just take Thomas and start afresh.

377
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,300
还有奥托呢
And Otto.

378
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,420
对  当然了  托马斯需要他的父亲
Yes, of course.Thomas needs a father.

379
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:56,260
我没有跟查理或是任何人提...你的那个朋友
I didn't mention the er... you know,
your friend to Charlie or anyone.

380
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,280
很好
Good.

381
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,280
北一区  我是内维尔修女
North Wing One.Sister Neville speaking.

382
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
请稍等
Hold one moment.

383
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,220
护士  你的电话

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,360
喂  我打给了简  但是她不在
Hello?I phoned Jean but she's not there.

385
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,260
他跑出去了  我把他弄不回来
He ran out of the house and I can't get him back.

386
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,300
好吧  小莫
All right, Mo.

387
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
他现在在公园里
He's in the park.

388
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,300
我马上就来
I'm coming.

389
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,710
你好意思  修女  我得回家一趟
Sorry,Sister,I need to go home.

390
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,220
出什么事啦吗
What's the problem?

391
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,340
- 煤气泄漏  - 煤气
- Gas leak. - Gas?

392
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,320
你不会对我撒谎的  对吧  小姐
You wouldn't be lying to me,would you,young lady?

393
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,510
- 去吧  去忙你的事儿吧   - 谢谢

但你会卷进来的
But you'll be in it.

396
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,400
那我只开车不说话  如何
Well, how about I don't talk? I'll just drive.

397
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,460
你好  我过来接管这边
Hello. I've come to take over.

398
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,280
啊~  简
Ah...Jean?

399
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,500
你就是...病人吗
Are you...the patient?

400
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,300
不好意思  鲍威尔先生没告诉我你的名字
Sorry, Mr Powell didn't tell me your name.

401
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,400
不是  我只是她的一个老朋友
No, I'm her oldest friend.

402
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,600
进去吧  她在等你
Go through, she's expecting you.

403
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
我一定看起来很可怕
I must look a fright.

404
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,440
我们之前见过面  对吧
We've met before, haven't we?

405
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,260
你是玛格丽特・道尔顿
You're Margaret Dalton.

406
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,360
- 你认识理查德  - 没错

407

408
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,300
你真是个可人儿
You're a peach.

409
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,300
- 离我远点儿  - 求你了  米切尔先生
- Get away from me! - Please, Mr Meecher.

410
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,340
- 我会淹死你的  你想被淹吗  - 求你了
- I'll drown you. You want drowning? - Please.

411
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:27,440
我只是想帮忙而已
I'm just trying to help you.

412
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,300
我过去可是在海峡游过泳  一天两次呢
I swam the Channel, I did. Twice a bloody day.

413
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,300
- 天呐  - 别管我
- Oh, God. - Leave me alone!

414
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
- 出去  - 米切尔先生

415
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,240
你能...快出去

416
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,220
- 小莫  - 我真的很抱歉

417
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,159
快走吧  我就想一个人玩玩而已
Go on. I'm just trying to enjoy myself.

00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,360
没事的  小莫  不是你的错
It's all right,Mo, not your fault.

419

420
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,260
爸

00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
快出来  里边不安全

422
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,400
- 我还没玩够呢  - 求你了

423
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,240
还没玩够  没玩够呢

你好  我想跟你一块玩

希望你别介意

427
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,220
我是你女儿的朋友

428

这样确实很好玩  也很酷
It's nice and cool.

429
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,440
没关系的
It's OK.

430
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,280
- 你的地址  - 嗯... 德雷克街五号
- What's his address? - Um...7 Drake Way.

431
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,220
你的名字

432
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,560
穆里根  莫林

433
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,260
- 手给我  爸  - 小心点
- Here you go, Dad. - Careful.

434
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
你在干嘛呢
What are you doing?

435
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,320
你可能想毒死我呢
You might want to poison me.

436
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,360
要不是我已经中毒够深了的话
If I wasn't already poisoned.

437
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,640
你需要打吗啡
You need morphia.

438
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,280
我觉得我现在需要一些吗啡

439
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,320
谢谢

440
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
我母亲也得过宫颈癌
My mother had cervical cancer.

441
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,300
六年前去世了

442
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,400
- 我很遗憾  - 我在家护理的他

443
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:13,200
我一直在努力...提升自我

444
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,400
变得端庄迷人
To be alluring and demure.

445
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,300
有能力  又不过分有能力  有好奇心  又风趣
Capable, not-too-capable, interested, amusing...

446
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,240
不让...我的家庭背景给我造成负担
Not...weighed down by my background.

447
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,440
我一直试着让他觉得我很完美
I've tried to be perfect for him.

448
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,320
你是怎么做到的
How do you do it?

449
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,200
不要再装作别人
Stop pretending to be somebody else.

450
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
你希望他爱你吗
You want him to love you?

451
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,320
去爱原原本本的你吗
To love you?

452
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,260
让他看到真实的你  做回自己
Well, let him see you. Be yourself.

453
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,999
真的  我以为门锁好了的
Really, I thought the door was locked.

454
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,750
没关系的  小莫
It's all right, Mo.

455
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:12,640
照顾他不是你一个人的责任  是我们共同的责任
He can't be your responsibility. He's ours.

456
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,579
很高兴见到你  先生
It was very nice to meet you, sir.

457
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,420
我再也不会让他跑出去了
I'll never let him go again.

458
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,400
- 你想娶我女儿吗  - 不是  爸  他...
- You looking for a wife? - No, Dad, he's...

459
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,260
他不是的
He's not.

460
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,640
你应该见过她的姐姐...简了
You should meet her sister - Jean.

461
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,360
我很乐意告诉你我已经有那个荣幸见过她了
I'm glad to say that I've already had that pleasure.

462
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
你是个幸运的男人
You're a very lucky man...

463
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,280
能有两个这么优秀的女儿
to have two such exceptional daughters.

464
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,440
我母亲死了之后  简就一个人在这儿照顾了老爸五年
After Mum died...Jean stayed here and cared for Dad for five years.

465
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,380
她有权利拥有一个不一样的未来
She has a right to a different future.

466
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,300
还有一个不一样的过去
And a different past.

467
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,400
应该是失去双亲  而有个非神经错乱的父亲这一耻辱
In which she loses both parents and avoided
the shame of a father of unsound mind.

468
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,380
那就让她这样
So be it.

469
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,740
不管是她的秘密  还是你的  我都会替你们保守
Her secret - and your secret - is safe with me.

470
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,700
- 你不会告诉理查德吗  - 我不会透露给任何人的
- You won't tell Richard? - I won't tell anyone.

471
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,360
我该进屋去了
I should go back in.

472
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,280
你在这儿干嘛呢
What are you doing here?

473
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
显而易见  不是吗
Isn't it obvious?

474
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,240
进来吧
Come in.

475
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,340
她在卧室呢
She's in the bedroom.

476
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,320
你知道卧室在哪儿吧
You know where that is.

477
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,360
不知道吗  那就跟我来吧
No? Follow me.

478
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,360
他来了
He's here.

479
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,240
你好
Hello.

480
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,340
今晚护士会过来陪她一小时
The night nurse will be here in an hour or so.

481
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,480
那我现在先走了  你们俩单独呆会儿吧
So I'll go now.Leave you two together.

482
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,300
- 真是愚蠢至极  - 但这一切都是谁造成的呢
- This is madness. - And who's responsible for it?

483
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,320
- 奥托  - 不是他  是你
- Otto. - No. You.

484
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,420
还有我
And me.

485
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,380
但他怎么能这样做  把简派到这儿来
But how could he? Sending Jean here.

486
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,560
这样我们就能见到对方  坦诚相见
So we could see each other,really see each other.

487
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,360
我们三个人都是
All three of us.

488
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,420
我很欣慰  你也该感到欣慰
I'm glad. You should be glad too.

489
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
过来  握住我的手
Come on, take my hand.

490
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,420
求你了
Please.

491
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
我很欣赏你的妻子
I love your wife.

492
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,300
而她又那么爱你
And she loves you.

493
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,460
别失去她
Don't lose her.

494
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,640
圣奥尔本医院寄过来的的  我能替你打开吗
It's from St Albans.Shall I open it for you?

495
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,680
不用了  但还是谢谢你
No. Thank you.

496
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,700
但这是我的事
My responsibility.

497
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,600
天呐
Oh, dear.

498
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,580
恐怕是坏消息
Bad news, I'm afraid.

499
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,620
没有新的开始了
No new start.

500
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,540
哦
Oh.

501
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,660
好吧
Oh, well.

502
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
算了
Never mind.

503
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,620
待会儿见
See you later.

504
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
振作点
Chin up.

505
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,500
你这几天一直对我避而不见
You've been avoiding me these last few days.

506
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,620
- 她怎么样了  - 你是说简还是玛格丽特
- How is she? - Jean or Margaret?

507
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,600
玛格丽特
Margaret.

508
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,520
茶饭无思  日益衰弱
Eating nothing. Fading.

509
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,520
但我很确信她受到很好的关怀  不是吗
But she's well cared for, I trust?

510
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,860
你做得太过了
You've got some nerve.

511
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,740
你以为你是我们的上司就能对我们为所欲为了吗
You think we're all in your theatre
and you can do whatever you want with us.

512
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
看样子你是不想让她得到好的照顾咯
So you don't want the best for her?

513
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,720
- 没人比简更适合照顾她了  - 特拉斯科特医生
- There's no one better than Jean.- Dr Truscott?

00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,540
你的妻子打电话找你  说是事态紧急
Your wife's on the telephone. It's urgent.

515
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,620
书包拿了吗
Got your satchel?

516
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,680
我想开车送你们
I thought I might drive you.

517
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,660
早上好  托马斯

518
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,580
野猫把你的舌头吃了吗
Has the cat got your tongue?

519
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,480
- 早上好  先生  - 你的好意我心领了
- Good morning, sir. - What a kind offer.

520
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,540
但我不想再给你添麻烦
I couldn't put you to so much trouble.

521
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,680
一点钟再过来如何
But, please, come back at, say, one?

522
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,660
一起吃个午餐
We'll have lunch.

523
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,720
乐意之至

524
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,920
- 他是谁啊  - 一个老朋友
- Who was he? - An old friend.

525
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,540
我们家的老朋友
Of the family.

526
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,700
我们不能告诉爸爸这件事  不然会破坏这份惊喜的
Now we mustn't mention him to Daddy,
else it'll spoil the surprise.

527
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,680
要是男孩子能保守秘密就会有糖奖励哦
And there'll be special sweets for boys who can keep secrets.

528
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,840
我想感谢你那天为我父亲所做的事
I wanted to thank you... for what
you did the other day with my father.

529
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,860
不用  我很开...非常开心这么做
No, I was happy...more than happy.

530
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,600
我得问你一些问题
I need to ask you some questions.

531
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,920
关于你 关于你的婚姻
About you. About your marriage.

532
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,660
- 你讨厌你的妻子吗  - 不
-Are you going to tell me you hate your wife?-No

533
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,660
那她不理解你吗
But she doesn't understand you?

534
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,580
她理解我  非常理解
She understands me. Very well.

535
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,620
还是说...
But the...

536
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,720
- 浪漫  - 浪漫吗
..romance... - The romance?

537
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,740
- 已经不复存在了  - 不
- ..has died? - No.

538
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,520
我们从未有过浪漫
It was never there.

539
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,680
从来没有过
Ever.

540
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,000
我从来都没跟她亲热过
I have...never even kissed her.

541
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,520
- 但你有个儿子  - 对
- You have a son. - Yes.

542
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,600
- 我们是有个儿子  - 但这说不通啊
- We have a son. -It doesn't make sense.

543
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,520
会的
It will.

544
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,500
总有一天会说得通的  要是你肯信任我的话
One day it will.If...you can just trust me.

545
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
你对我还隐瞒了什么
What are you hiding?

546
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,580
- 我现在不能告诉你  - 那我们就不能再继续发展下去
-I can't tell you.-Then we can't go any further.

547
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,580

Margaret?

550
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,620
我让你们单独呆会儿吧
I'll leave you two alone.

551

不
No.

我没有得到
Didn't get it.

555
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,580
那份工作
The job.

556
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,640
抱歉了  老兄  你暂时摆脱不了我了
So, sorry, chum, you're stuck with me.

557
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,540
不  对我来说是件好事  我们是好搭档嘛
No, that's great for me. We're a good team.

558
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,720
没错  对吧
We are, aren't we?

559
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,740
自从塞浦路斯事件之后
Ever since Cyprus.

560
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,580
你在驾驶座上
You in the driving seat.

561
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,720
- 我们相互依靠  - 没错

562
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,500
双手沾满鲜血
Blood on our hands.

563
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,710
一切都还好吧  查理
Everything all right, Charlie?

564
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,620
一切都好  很好
Everything's fine. Tickety-boo.

565
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,540
我不好
No...

566
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,600
说实话  我感到绝望了
Felt a bit dead out there,to be honest.

567
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,580
心里面空荡荡的
Like there was nothing at stake.

568
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,640
- 可是这...  - 你也脱不了干系
- Whereas here... - You're involved.

569
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,660
没错
Exactly.

570
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,580
鲍威尔先生  有你的电话
Mr Powell, telephone call for you.

571
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,620
奥托  我要你马上回家  马上
Otto, I need you to come home now.

572
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,620
我就知道你背叛了我
I knew you'd betray me.

573
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,560
我就知道
I knew.

574
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,600
还说什么“一点钟再过来”
'Come back at one.'

575
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,620
我从你眼里什么都看出来了
I saw it in your eyes.

576
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,560
你还有什么可辩解的
What have you got to say for yourself?

577
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,680
你不能  你不能...
You can't. You can't...

578
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,620
你怎么能这样对我  我向你袒露了我的心声
How could you? I bare my soul to you!

579
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,700
- 而你却转过来投进他的怀抱  - 他是我丈夫
- And you turn to him. - He's my husband.

580
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,720
你觉得他能与我相抗衡吗
You think he can confront me:

581
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,219
能与我这个拥有一切  无所不用其极
the man who has everything, who can

582
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,520
还能在事后还能逃避制裁的人相抗衡吗
do anything, and get away with it?

583
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,500
不  他不能
No. No, he can't.

584
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,560
你也看见过证据了
You saw the evidence.

585
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,519
你向他提到了我的名字
You mention me, you breathe my name

586
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,920
那么他那璀璨的人生就要终结了
to him and his charmed life is over.

587
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,700
还有你的  甚至是托马斯的
And yours. And Thomas's.

588
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,500
我的爱就那么一文不值吗
Does my love mean nothing?

589
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,740
- 殡仪承办方来了  - 谢谢
- The undertakers are coming. - Thank you.

590
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,620
出什么事了
What's wrong?

591
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,720
你从来都不关心家里
You're never here.

592
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,720
等等  这不完全是真的
Well, hang on, that's not entirely true.

593
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,560
确实是  即使你在关心这个家  也不是真在关心
It is. Even if you are,you're not really.

594
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,279
我当然关心这个家
Of course I am.

595
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,680
但不是你想关心的  也不是发自真心
Not in your head.Not in your...heart.

596
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,540
你陷入爱河了
You're falling in love.

597
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,960
但你不能  你知道规则的
Well, you can't. You know the rules.

598
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,540
你是他的父亲
You're his father.

599
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,500
我是他的父亲
I'm his father.

600
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,880
- 我们以此谎言为生  - 我们以此谎言为生
- The lie we live by. - The lie we live by.

601
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,640
我需要你遵守自己的诺言
I need you to keep your promise.

602
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,540
永远保护他  永远保护我
To always protect him. And me.

603
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,580
我会的
I will.

604
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:06,580

你有权掌控任何事  但是不能掌控我  明白吗
You have power over everything but not me, understand?

606
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,720

我想要你
I want you.

608
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,020
奥托・鲍威尔虽然是个不错的男人  但同时也很难猜得透
Otto Powell is a good but very complicated man.

609
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,020
你跟我都是同一类人
We're the same, you and me.

610
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,520
你在害怕什么
What are you so frightened of?

611
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:24,820
- 我才不要进监狱  - 我会处理好的
- I am not going to prison. - I will handle this.

612
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:22,150
你杀人了吗  查理
Did you kill someone, Charlie?

613
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:28,860
你再也没有机会扮演上帝的角色了
You are no longer playing God.

614
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,760
- 穆里根到底想要什么  - 我认为他想要我
- What does Mulligan want? - I think he wants me.

615
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,700
还有...毁掉你
And to destroy you.
