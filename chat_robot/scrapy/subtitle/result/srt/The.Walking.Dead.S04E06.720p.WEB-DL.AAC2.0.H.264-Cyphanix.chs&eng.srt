1
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,500
* In my hands I hold the ashes *

2
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,430
* In my veins black pitch runs *

3
00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:00,170
* In my chest the fire catches *

4
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,760
* In my way a setting sun *

5
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:15,220
* Dark clouds gather round me *

6
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,690
* To the West my soul is bound *

7
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:30,930
* But I will go on ahead free *

8
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,410
* There is a light yet to be found *

9
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,070
* The last pale light in the west *

10
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,950
我已经在路上漂泊了几个月
I've been on the road for a couple of months.

11
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,440
你一个人吗
By yourself?

12
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,770
是啊
Yeah.

13
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,880
之前你住在哪里
Where did you live before that?

14
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,900
一座小镇上
I was in a town.

15
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,090
那里有这些怪物吗
Were the monsters there?

16
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,200
没有
No.

17
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,310
那里很安全
It was safe.

18
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,730
别回家
布莱恩・赫里奥特

19
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,580
都是好人
Full of good people.

20
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,290
查德・克里尔死亡
梅根・库克死亡
我们找到了肯・琼斯

21
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,880
出什么事了
What happened?

22
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,440
我们爱你
布莱恩・赫里奥特

23
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,290
他发疯了
He just lost it.

24
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,930
谁
Who?

25
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,470
掌管大权的人
The man in charge.

26
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,420
我差点死在那里
I barely got out alive.

27
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:39,170
* And I ask for no redemption *

28
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,560
* In this cold and barron place *

29
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,380
* Still I see the faint reflection *

30
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:02,020
* And so by it, I got my way *

31
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,510
* The last pale light in the west *

32
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,850
* The last pale light in the west *

你看上去就像差点死了
You look like you barely got out alive.

38
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,390
-塔拉  -我是说
- Tara. - I mean...

39
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,910
我们有点精神紧张
We're a little on edge.

40
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,720
我们一直躲藏在这里
We've been holed up in here

41
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,260
等着国民警卫队  自从...
waiting for the National Guard since--

42
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,220
-他妈的一切大乱开始  -注意用词
- The shit hit the fan. - Language.

43
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,470
自从一切大乱开始
Since the crap hit the fan.

44
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:16,980
的确如此
Which it did

45
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,610
然后就蔓延到了整个区域
right before it got flung all over the damn place.

46
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,050
你打算待在大楼里吗
Are you planning on staying in the building?

47
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,160
你到底打不打算留下来
Are you planning on staying or not?

48
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,510
-该死  这是个哑巴  -塔拉
- Holy shit, with the no talking. - Tara.

49
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,830
我妹问了你一个问题
My sister asked you a question.

50
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,640
只过一晚
Just for the night.

51
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,670
你看见这个了吗
You see this?

52
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,270
这是一把装满子弹的标配史密斯威森手枪
This here is a fully loaded, standard issue Smith & Wesson.

53
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,360
我是亚特兰大警察
I'm Atlanta City Police

54
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,810
这里有足够的枪支弹药  可以在接下来十年里
and I have enough artillery in here to kill you

55
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,940
每天杀死你一次
every day for the next 10 years.

56
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,800
你要是敢耍我或者我家人
You mess with me or my family,

57
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,240
我向耶稣发誓  我会干掉你的
and I swear to Christ, I will put you down.

58
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,220
懂吗
Got it?

59
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,400
懂了
Got it.

60
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,020
那我们就没事了
Then we're cool.

61
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,300
来击拳吧
Pound it.

62
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:18,960
给  哥们
Here, bro.

63
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,080
在你走之前  这个我们得留着
We'll hold onto this until you go.

64
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:24,850
是的
Yeah.

65
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,230
你叫什么名字
You got a name?

66
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,330
布莱恩
Brian.

67
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,240
布莱恩・赫里奥特
Brian Heriot.

68
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,300
你肯定饿了
You got to be hungry.

69
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,040
里面没什么更好的东西了
You're not gonna find anything better in there.

70
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,450
自从威尔海姆小姐去了佛罗里达
Tara ransacked the place

71
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,550
塔拉就将这里搜索一空
after Miss Wilhelm took off for Florida.

72
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,960
威尔海姆小姐最爱吃白凤豆
Big fan of butter beans, Miss Wilhelm.

73
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,580
谢谢
Thank you.

74
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,570
...四  五
...four, five.

75
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,840
过来  孩子  看看你有多大能耐
Come on, kiddo. Show me what you got here.

76
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,340
一切还好吗
Everything okay?

77
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,670
她又开始不吃饭了
She didn't eat again.

78
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,750
她爱吃腌牛肉  试试那个
She likes the corned beef. Try that.

79
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,650
最后两罐我是留给老爸的
I'm saving the last two cans for Dad.

80
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,670
并不是她挑食  而是她害怕
She's not picky, she's terrified.

81
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,570
伙计  您悠着点可以吗
Why don't you slow down, buddy, all right?

82
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,000
这里又不是假日酒店
This ain't the Holiday Inn.

83
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,530
左侧的木桶是洗涤用水
Bucket on the left is for washing,

84
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,950
右侧是清水
right is for rinsing.

85
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,570
塔拉
Tara.

86
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,240
抱歉
Sorry.

87
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,610
你够吃吗
You get enough to eat?

88
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,850
我给你倒点咖啡
I'll get you some coffee.

89
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,230
坐吧
Sit down.

90
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,930
去那儿坐着
Right there. Go on.

91
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,560
再掷一次
Go ahead, roll again.

92
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,750
嘿  过来啊
Hey, come here.

93
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,360
你有香烟吗
You got a cigarette?

94
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,270
老爸  你的氧气筒
Dad, your oxygen tank.

95
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,200
你没看见警告标志吗
Do you not see that red sticker?

96
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,190
我们千辛万苦才活下来
I'll be damned if a Merit

97
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,990
我们好不容易活到现在
Ultra Menthol is gonna blow this place up

98
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,770
可不能因为你抽烟而把这地方炸掉
after all the work we've done to stay alive up here. Okay?

99
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,650
莉莉  没什么问题
It's all the same, Lily.

100
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,240
你能别这样说了吗
You can stop that talk right there.

101
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,270
不就是抽根烟吗
It's just a cigarette.

102
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,700
请自便
Help yourself.

103
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,220
我们的食物还能吃上一阵
We got roni sticks for days.

104
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,440
说不定够撑几年
Years, probably.

105
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,260
看见外面停的那辆大货车没
You see that big truck parked outside?

106
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,640
那可是戈贝利食品大货车
Come on, dude, the Gorbelli food truck.

107
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,700
雷・查尔斯都可以看见[盲人歌手]
Ray Charles could have seen it.

108
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,780
是啊
Yeah.

109
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,750
老爸给他们开车
Dad drove for them.

110
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,040
即便是还背着氧气瓶
Even with the tank.

111
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,190
他们当时关闭了75号公路
The day they closed down the 75--

112
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,270
从"他-妈-的"天下大乱开始
When the S-H-I-T hit the fan.

113
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,410
他从学校接了梅根  到医院接了我
He grabbed Megan from school, picked me up at the hospital--

114
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,300
她还从医院里偷了几个氧气瓶
She stole a bunch of oxygen tanks from that dump.

115
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,250
接着我们仨一起去接塔拉
Then the three of us rushed over to get Tara.

116
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,180
那时我在警局工作  登记犯人
I was at the station working, booking.

117
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,840
后来发生了这一切
With everything going on,

118
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,290
行尸袭来  军队进驻亚特兰大
the attacks, the Army going into Atlanta,

119
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,710
之后他便让我们与他寸步不离
he wasn't about to let us out of his sight.

120
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,620
还好我们比较走运
Lucky for us,

121
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,140
老爸的货车里囤了好多东西
the old man's truck was pretty much stocked

122
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,150
堆到天花板的意面圈
floor to ceiling with sketti rings,

123
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,770
火鸡辣酱汤  还有这些小吃
turkey chili, and these little suckers.

124
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,040
小梅  爷爷得休息一下了  好吗
Meggie, Granddad needs a break, okay?

125
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,260
-莉莉  -来了  爸爸
- Lily. - Sure, Daddy.

126
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,000
数到三
On three.

127
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,750
大个子  过来搭把手吧
A little help here, big guy.

128
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,870
来
Here.

129
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,730
好吧  叫的不是你
Oh, right. No, not you.

130
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,440
是屋里的另外一个大个子
The other big guy in the room.

131
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,200
塔拉
Tara.

132
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,420
行了
Okay.

133
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,700
数到三
On three.

134
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,150
好的  一  二
Okay, one, two--

135
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,610
这里  这里
Here. Here.

136
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,140
听到那些东西了么
You hear them?

137
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,200
听到了
Yeah.

138
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,540
能抬一下我的腿吗  朋友
Get my legs, friend?

139
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,340
塔拉去了上面好几次
Tara's been up there a bunch of times

140
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,880
把那些混球轰成碎片
blasting them bastards to pieces.

141
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,770
她说那些东西倒下了又不停地站起来
She says they just keep getting back up.

142
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,570
我告诉她别再上去了
I told her no more.

143
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,330
不能让她继续浪费子弹了
Can't afford to waste her bullets.

144
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,190
你有小孩吗
You got kids?

145
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,090
没有
No.

146
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,140
我的女儿们出生的时候
When my girls were born,

147
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,740
我终于明白了成为一个男人意味着什么
that's when I finally figured out what it was to be a man.

148
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,880
你懂的  一个真男人
You know, a real man.

149
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,430
你保护她们  保证她们安全
You protect them, you keep them safe.

150
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,280
你花尽心思让她们变得更强
You just try to make them stronger

151
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,850
直到她们能自己照看自己
until they can look out for themselves.

152
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,100
但是  现在这种情况
But this here,

153
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,860
我从未想过这种事情发生
I-- I never counted on this.

154
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,760
我有个伙计
Hey, I got a buddy.

155
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,230
比尔・詹金斯  他住在303
Bill Jenkins, he lives up in 303.

156
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,900
他那儿有套很棒的西洋双陆棋
He's got a real nice backgammon set up there.

157
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,780
他不会介意的  他把它放在他的床底下
He won't mind and he keeps it under his bed there.

158
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,090
拜托了
Just... please.

159
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,830
你在外面生活过
You've been out there in the world

160
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,670
你知道在那些东西周围如何保护你自己
and you know how to handle yourself around those things.

161
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,800
听着  我知道你也许不理解
Look, I know you might not understand it

162
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,360
因为你没有一个宝贝女儿
'cause you don't got a baby girl of your own,

163
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,140
但是
but...

164
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,490
这东西也许能让我的梅根重新开始说话
it might be something that might make my Megan talk again.

165
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,600
拜托了
Please.

166
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,210
谢谢你
Thank you.

167
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,310
不客气
You're welcome.

168
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,650
给你带上路的一些东西
Couple things for the road.

169
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,140
我自己可以
I'm okay.

170
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,870
你帮了我们
You helped us.

171
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,980
这是我们的谢意
We're saying thank you.

172
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,900
你自己看着办吧
Deal with it.

173
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,780
我估计你需要这个
I guess you'll be needing this back.

174
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,520
你留着吧
Keep it.

175
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,790
别
Don't...

176
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,800
用那玩意儿扔我
throw that at me.

177
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,400
这是你的枪
It's your gun.

178
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,710
你可以拿回去
You can have it back.

179
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,460
你也需要一把
You need another one.

180
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,550
我有这个了
I have this.

181
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,440
塔拉说的没错
Tara was right.

182
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,110
我们应该搜你的身
We should have frisked you.

183
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,300
我在楼上发现的
I found it upstairs.

184
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,950
你留着那把吧
You keep that.

185
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,690
你们要命中脑袋才行
You have to kill the brain.

186
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,810
什么
What?

187
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,600
你妹妹  她冲着它们的身体射击
Your sister, she shot 'em in the body,

188
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,870
但你们得射这里
but you have to hit 'em here.

189
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,310
这样才能杀死它们
That's what kills them.

190
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,250
为什么
Why?

191
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,420
我有些事情得求你
I need to ask you something.

192
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,000
我爸爸患了晚期肺癌
My dad's got stage four lung cancer.

193
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,360
我参加过好几年的肿瘤学工作
I worked oncology for a few years.

194
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,700
他已经快不行了
He's nearing the end.

195
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,330
他的氧气还剩两天的量
He's got about two days of oxygen.

196
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,250
也许更少
Maybe less.

197
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,700
我们没从来没想过他能挺这么长时间
We never thought he'd make it this long.

198
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,210
你已经为我们做了很多  但是...
You've already done so much for us, but...

199
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,060
几个街区之外
there's an old folks home

200
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,230
有一栋旧民房
a couple of blocks from here.

201
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,630
哪怕只有一罐也行
Even one tank would mean everything.

202
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,760
他是唯一能让梅根微笑的人
He's the only one who can put a smile on Megan's face.

203
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,040
哪怕只有一秒也好
Even for a second.

204
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,000
这两个都是满的
They're both full.

205
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,240
你还好吗
Are you okay?

206
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,380
是的
Yeah.

207
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,520
你还没让我说谢谢呢
You didn't let me say thank you.

208
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,520
我没事
Yeah, I'm okay.

209
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,770
坐吧
Sit.

210
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,740
让我来重操旧业当护士
Let me be a nurse again.

211
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,420
好消息是你看来不需要缝针
Good news is it doesn't look like you need any stitches.

212
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,830
坏消息是
Bad news...

213
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,040
这会像狂蜂蜇了一样疼
this is gonna sting like a couple of angry bees.

214
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,090
有事做的感觉真好
Feels good to have something to do.

215
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,610
从来没人说起过
Nobody ever mentioned just

216
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,350
世界末日竟然会这么无聊
how boring the end of the world was gonna be.

217
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,090
她以为你是她爸爸
She thought you were her dad.

218
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,050
梅根
Megan.

219
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,230
当她看见你在外头街上时
When she saw you out there on the street.

220
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,250
三年半前的一个晚上  他出了门
He went out one night about three and a half years ago

221
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,110
去买几瓶啤酒和强力球彩票
to get a couple beers and a Powerball ticket.

222
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,970
他说他很快就回来
Said he'd be right back.

223
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,970
梅根把你认成了他
Megan thought you were him,

224
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,950
以为你终于回来了
finally coming right back.

225
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,840
-妈妈  -在这里  亲爱的
- Mama. - In here, honey.

226
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,800
一切都很好  甜心
Everything's okay, sweetheart.

227
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,850
布莱恩受了点小伤  需要清理一下
Brian just got a boo-boo that needs a little cleaning up.

228
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,290
就跟你被割伤时一样
Same as when you get a cut.

229
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,840
我没拿药膏
I don't have the ointment.

230
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,740
我去拿药  你帮我看护一下病人吧
Why don't you watch my patient until I get back?

231
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,450
好的
Okay.

232
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,970
你眼睛怎么了
What happened to your eye?

233
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,410
没了
It's gone.

234
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,060
出了什么事吗
Something happen to you

235
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,870
还是你一生下来就这样
or were you just born like that?

236
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,760
出了事
Something happened to me.

237
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,700
我是不是不该问
Was that bad to ask?

238
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,070
没事
No.

239
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,220
我会告诉你我的眼睛怎么了
I'll tell you what happened to my eye,

240
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,860
但你得发誓保守秘密
but you have to promise to keep it secret.

241
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,370
我发誓
I promise.

242
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,280
那是什么意思
What's that?

243
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,200
拉钩上吊不许变
Pinkie swear.

244
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,410
发誓保密  否则不得好死
Plus cross my heart and hope to die.

245
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,810
好吧
Well...

246
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,220
我是个海盗
I'm a pirate.

247
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,220
不可能
No way.

248
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,130
被你识破了
Yeah, you caught me.

249
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,640
其实是我救人的时候出了事
What really happened was I was trying to help someone.

250
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,230
为了救我深爱的人
Someone I loved very much.

251
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,710
你怎么帮助他们的
How were you trying to help them?

252
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,350
我想尽力保护他们
I was trying to protect them, you know?

253
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,980
不让他们受伤
Stop them getting hurt.

254
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,320
但你自己受伤了
But you got hurt instead.

255
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,530
是啊
Yeah.

256
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,080
他们也受伤了吗
Did they get hurt, too?

257
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,110
是  是啊  也受伤了
Yeah, yeah, they did.

258
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,860
我真遗憾
I'm sorry.

259
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,520
我也是
Me, too.

260
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,590
这是什么
What is it?

261
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,360
国际象棋
Chess.

262
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,260
看起来好难
Looks hard.

263
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,640
对有些人来说可能会难  但你很聪明
Well, maybe for some folks, but you're smart.

264
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,200
你很快就能学会
You'll catch on quick.

265
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,910
这个棋子叫什么
What's this one called?

266
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,730
那是卒
That's a pawn.

267
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,590
他们是你的士兵
They're your soldiers.

268
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,920
他们会死吗
Do they die?

269
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,030
有时会的
Sometimes.

270
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,580
如果他们都死了  你就输了吗
Do you lose if they die?

271
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,250
不  不一定
No, not necessarily.

272
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,550
有时就算折损了很多小卒
You can lose a lot of soldiers,

273
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,190
你还是可以赢得棋局
but still win the game.

274
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,000
那是国王
That's the king.

275
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,440
你要想办法俘虏他
That's the guy you want to capture.

276
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,830
你在干什么
What are you doing?

277
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,230
你等着瞧吧
You'll see.

278
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,400
像你
Looks like you.

279
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,920
是啊
Yeah.

280
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,790
好了  来下棋吧
Come on, let's play.

281
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,430
这些是卒
So these ones are pawns.

282
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,430
他去世了
He's gone.

283
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,450
我想他已经去世有一会儿了
I think he's been gone a while.

284
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,100
你们应该离开这里
Y'all should go now.

285
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,940
给我们点时间
Just give us a minute.

286
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,290
我爱你  爸爸
I love you, Daddy.

287
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,020
塔拉
Tara!

288
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,950
-住手  你在干什么  -那不是爸爸
- Stop! What are you doing? - It's not Dad!

289
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,680
-快住手  -不是爸爸
- Stop! - It's not Dad!

290
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,740
我知道  好吗
I know, okay?

291
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,180
无论如何都会这样吗
It happens no matter what?

292
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,430
是的
Yeah.

293
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,530
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

294
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,700
他本可以咬到我
He could have got me.

295
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,060
差点就咬到我了
He almost got me.

296
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,140
我在想
I was thinking

297
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,340
如果他还在  一定会很感激你
he would have been grateful or whatever

298
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,210
及时制止了他
that you stopped him, from him--

299
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,540
你懂我的意思吗
you know what I mean?

300
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,350
所以  我们没闹翻
So, yeah, we're cool.

301
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,740
再见
Good-bye.

302
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,690
不行
No.

303
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,790
-我们要跟你一起去  -不行
- We're coming with you. - No.

304
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,170
肯定有更安全的地方
There has to be someplace better,

305
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,510
你要帮我们找到
and you're gonna help us find it.

306
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,650
-莉莉  -我看到照片了  布莱恩
- Lily. - I saw the picture, Brian.

307
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,470
你曾有家人  我知道
You had a family, I know that.

308
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,270
我也知道我们不是她们
And I know we're not them.

309
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,940
但就现在来说  你必须跟我们在一起
But for now, you're stuck with us.

310
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,890
-只有这一个办法  -我不能这样
- And that's just the way it's gonna be. - I can't.

311
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,270
你已经这样了
You already have.

312
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,280
我们该去哪儿
Where should we go?

313
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,020
计划是没用的
No use making a plan.

314
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,060
它们让我们去哪儿  我们就去哪儿
We'll go where they let us.

315
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,110
它们是谁
Who's they?

316
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,980
道路
The roads.

317
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,290
行尸
The biters.

318
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,690
我其实不算是警察
I'm not really a cop.

319
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,730
但也不全是谎话
I mean, it's not a total lie.

320
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,090
我是警校学生
I was in the academy.

321
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,140
抱歉对你说谎了
I'm sorry I lied to you.

322
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,870
你不必感到抱歉
You don't have to be sorry.

323
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,600
我确实很抱歉
Well, I am.

324
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,990
你觉得我们能到吗
Do you think we can make it?

325
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,370
我们能的
We'll make it.

326
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,140
你在骗我吗
Are you lying to me?

327
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,680
没有
No.

328
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,760
你可以过来  梅根
You can come join us, Megan.

329
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,510
过段时间就好了
It's just gonna take some time.

330
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:23,930
没事
It's okay.

331
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,710
我们很快就能找到一辆车
We'll find another car soon.

332
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,430
但愿你是对的
I hope you're right.

333
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,980
这乡村景色总是让我想起萨姆
This whole country backdrop is reminding me of Sam.

334
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,290
-又来了  -我以为她是我的真命天女
- Here we go. - I thought she was the one.

335
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,040
然后你们去野营  吃了蘑菇  全完了
Then you went camping, ate mushrooms, game over.

336
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,120
你忘记了
You're forgetting the part where

337
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,130
萨姆崩溃了  然后告诉我她有男朋友
Sam broke down and told me she had a boyfriend,

338
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,200
她其实不喜欢妹子
that she wasn't really into chicks.

339
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,450
那是我一生中最糟糕的周末
Ugh, worst weekend of my life.

340
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,300
