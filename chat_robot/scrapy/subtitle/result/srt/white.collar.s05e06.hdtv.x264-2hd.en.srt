1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,650
Previously on White Collar...

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:02,970
The Mosconi Codex.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,760
This is no ordinary book.

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,860
- Neal.
- Hello,Rebecca.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,920
You two know each other?

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,080
I swear,I had my key
card when I left work.

7
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,020
We figure out what's hidden in
those pages and get to it first.

8
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,370
I'm the reason the thief got in.

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,090
My hope was that the owner would let us
study and look at the Codex,and now it's gone.

10
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,110
David Siegel.Cause of death was
a gunshot wound to the sternum.

11
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,090
And we're no closer to figuring
out who did this and why.

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,970
Dr.Summers,I need your help.

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,460
Just because a person starts doing good things
doesn't mean he wants to stop doing bad things.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,080
I've been serving too many masters.

15
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,690
I'm through being everyone's puppet.

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,130
Which strings,exactly,do
you plan on cutting?

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,670
All of them.

18
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,850
I****

19
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,980
Even the chip in the cover works.

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,870
How'd you pull that off?

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,120
I don't make them.

22
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,050
I just sell them.

23
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,440
You son of a bitch.

24
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,170
Freeze!Hands in the air.

25
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,410
FBI!Don't move!

26
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,350
He's all yours.

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,590
- What?
- Don't "What" me.You know what.

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,290
I gave you specific instructions.

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,610
"Sit down,make the deal,get arrested."Three
out of three not good enough for you?

30
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,450
I don't remember mentioning
anything about follow-up questions

31
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,750
or interrogating the
suspect before the arrest.

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,310
Interrogating the suspect...What are you...What,the chip?
- The chip.

33
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,090
I was gathering information.
- For you or for us?

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,860
If I were up to something,you really
think I'd do it when you had ears on me?

35
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,630
That's exactly when you'd do it.

36
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,690
I have a feeling this is
about more than passports.

37
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,550
it's about passports.Also about the $2
million that went missing in the last case.

38
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,680
Dr.Summers might have some insight
- into its location.

39
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,800
Dr.Summers had a tendency to take bad guys who
wanna be good and turn them into worse guys.

40
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,500
What exactly happened
during your therapy session?

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,660
She encouraged me to
be the man I really am.

42
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,540
I think Lucy told Charlie Brown
that and only charged him 5￠.

43
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,280
And what kind of man
might that be,exactly?

44
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,700
We were gonna discuss that at our next
session.Now I have to wait 20 years.

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,280
I think these belong to Jones.

46
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,460
Hey,where'd you get all these?

47
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,790
Confiscated in various busts around
the city.Most in the last few weeks.

48
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,270
It's first-rate and identical.These
were all made by the same person.

49
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,500
- You're sure about that?
- Yeah,the eagle's eye.

50
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,820
There's a tiny dot in the center of this
one and in the one I bought from Ivan.

51
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,940
That dot is as good as a fingerprint.

52
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,420
So we're looking at a fairly
large forgery operation.

53
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,640
You think Ivan's the artist?

54
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,560
No,he says he only sells
them,and I believe him.

55
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,160
Anyone this good would take credit.

56
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,750
Think this has something to do with
the uptick of crime in Little Odessa?

57
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,610
I don't believe in coincidences.

58
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,250
Ivan's parking tickets.

59
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,490
Ten so far this year,and they're
all in the exact same spot.

60
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,620
I want traffic surveillance video for
the past six months on that address.

61
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,600
Already on it.

62
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,960
- Really?
- Really.

63
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,330
Same spot,day after day.

64
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,850
- Right in front of the hydrant.

65
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,600
There's plenty of metered
parking down the street.

66
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,840
Why risk another ticket?

67
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,200
Doris Day parking.

68
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,920
I'm sorry.Doris Day what?

69
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,940
Spot right in front.

70
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,540
The kind of parking Doris Day miraculously finds
- in all her movies.

71
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,780
- I never knew you were a fan.

72
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,780
Oh,I love 'em.

73
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,530
Place looks abandoned.

74
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,810
Yeah,not a bad spot for a
passport forgery operation.

75
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,370
Let's get a warrant and check it out.

76
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,870
The history of
cryptography...oddly cryptic.

77
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,060
Any luck finding out
what type of code this is?

78
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,690
I've ruled out transposition
and Caesar shifts.

79
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,610
and Sudoku and Kenken.

80
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,170
Well,in a happy accident,you may
have proven the Riemann Hypothesis.

81
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,480
The only thing I've proven
is that we need help.

82
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,450
I've studied every pattern,every symbol.

83
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,120
I can only conclude that
it is of alien origin.

84
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,740
I think you're right.

85
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,510
Finally,you've come around.

86
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,240
I think you're right.We need help.

87
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,730
Well,I do know a monk in Berlin
who dabbles in quantum mechanics.

88
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,700
You think Hagen's using monks?

89
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,320
I think Hagen is using you.

90
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,340
And me.

91
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,420
The only chance we have of getting a leg
up on him is by deciphering the Codex first.

92
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,450
- Until then...
- It's ticking clocks and phone calls.

93
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,420
All right,I gotta go. Peter and
I are headed to Little Odessa.

94
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,900
I do the talking.

95
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,980
We're just here on a
routine visit. Nothing more.

96
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,650
Well... doesn't look abandoned.

97
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,090
Looks like someone
brought it back to life.

98
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,270
Every time I see ice
like this,I'm ten again.

99
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,120
- Oh,she's good.
- Yeah.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,040
First Doris Day,now figure skating.

101
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,430
It's nice to see your softer side.

102
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,920
Who are you? What do you want?

103
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,270
We just have a few questions
for the owner of this building.

104
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,660
Put that away,or you'll
get all of us killed.

105
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,890
This is private facility.
You're trespassing.

106
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,900
I****

107
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,180
Q***

108
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,670
We just have a few questions.

109
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,820
Questions for Katya,the
talk of Little Odessa.

110
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,160
Neal Micali,sports agent.

111
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,070
I represent some of the
world's top athletes.

112
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,290
This is Peter Nevins,figure
skating coach to the stars.

116
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,550
Peter Nevins,coach?

117
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,910
Never heard of you.

118
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,040
Really? You ever heard of Tara
Lipinski? Or Michelle Kwan?

119
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,560
They would be ushers at the ice
capades if it weren't for this man.

120
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,130
yes. He's just-- he's just-- I simply help
them harness their own natural talents.

121
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,610
Sorry to be wasting your time,but
Katya has no interest in competing.

122
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:36,480
B***

123
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,660
-Thank you for your interest.

124
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,430
- Now,if you'll excuse us...
- It's not a problem.

125
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,850
We got another 20 girls to see by the end of the week,so...
- 27

126
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,440
- Is it 27 now?
- It's 27.

127
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,900
Listen...you're talented.Very talented.

128
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,470
Don't give up on your dream.

129
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,830
Sorry we wasted your time and ours.

130
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,220
Wait.

131
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,880
This is not the right time.

132
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,080
But don't choose another girl yet.

133
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,010
Here.

134
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,090
We'll be in touch.

135
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,620
- Figure skating coach?- What? You've
been skating since you were a junior G-man.

136
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,540
But that was hockey.We're
talking body checks,not twirls.

137
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,060
come on.It's a good cover.

138
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,490
I don't need a cover.I could go in there with
a tac team and turn that place upside down.

139
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,950
Yeah,you could if you wanted to
scare off the guys we're really after.

140
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,890
Just admit it-- best way
into this case is on skates.

141
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,690
You got a ticket.

142
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,920
Come on,this is for
your bio,not a mug shot.

143
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,440
- Come on.
- Oh,you're killing me.

144
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,590
I don't have time for
this.I've got ASAC work.

145
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,670
- I can't play
dress-up.- Just smile.

146
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,640
Rebecca?

147
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,410
From the Gershon Museum.

148
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,520
Neal,from the FBI.

149
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,400
- How are you?
- I'm,uh... terrible.

150
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,390
The museum world,it's really small.

151
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,200
I can't get another job.

152
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,260
I'm sorry to hear that.

153
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,340
Is there anything I can do to help?

154
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,140
You? No.

155
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,920
You've done enough.

156
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,980
- Wha...
- I've been thinking about that day that I lost my key card,

157
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,540
and you're the last person
that I remember having it with.

158
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,130
What,you don't think I stole it,do you?

159
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,100
- Why would I steal your key card?
- Nothing about that day makes sense.

160
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,260
- I had full access to the museum.
- I'm just here to get some answers and...

161
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,690
I was hoping to get a letter from Agent
Burke stating my complete innocence.

162
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,680
- There he is.- Uh,yeah,that's--
that's a really bad idea.

163
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,770
He is swamped on a new case right
now and just not in a giving mood.

164
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,980
Anyway,he wasn't even in charge
of the Gershon investigation.

165
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,280
- Then who was?
- That would be Agent Gruetzner.

166
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,020
Art Crimes.He's not at these offices.

167
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,990
So where do I find this Agent...

168
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,450
- Gruetzner?
- Gruetzner.

169
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,290
he is in the field today.

170
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,950
But I could set
something up for tomorrow.

171
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,410
- All right.
- All right?

172
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,730
- Tomorrow.
- Okay.

173
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,550
Let me give you my number.
You can text me the address.

174
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,410
We're the FBI. We have your number.

175
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,390
- I'll get you that letter.

176
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,200
What's the story?

177
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,060
Sergei Turgenev.

178
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,870
Our smooth-talking
friend from the ice rink.

179
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,950
Got that from a friend at FAPSI

180
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,530
- That's Russian intelligence.
- Russian intelligence.

181
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,090
Yeah,this is the Crime And
Punishment of rap sheets.

182
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,770
And this guy...is worse.

183
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,820
That's Sergei's cousin Nikolai.
Wanted for murder in Russia.

184
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,880
Money laundering,drug trafficking,arms
trafficking,human trafficking.

185
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,300
Basically,any kind of trafficking.Yeah.

186
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,800
Nobody knew he was in
the country until now.

187
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,690
We don't give visas to criminals,so
either he snuck in on a tuna boat...

188
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,700
Or he flew here first-class
using one of Sergei's passports.

189
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,630
Question is...

190
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:41,270
if Sergei can bring Nikolai in here without
us knowing,who else is he planning to import?

191
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,630
If I had known about this,

192
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,490
you could be playing hockey with Sergei

193
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,860
instead of learning the difference
between a lutz and a salchow.

194
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,290
All right,don't you worry about me.

195
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,710
You just focus on becoming
a top sports agent.

196
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,130
Con men taking 10%?

197
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,030
I think I can handle it.

198
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,250
Okay,let me get this straight.

199
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,400
You need to become an expert
figure skating coach in a day?

200
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,490
No,I just need to look the part
and learn enough to pass muster.

201
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,200
So...what can you tell me?

202
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,920
- Me?
- Yeah.

203
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,080
- You want me to coach you to become a coach?
- Yeah.

204
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,610
Honey,you have watched
enough figure skating

205
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,410
to do color commentary on
the next world championship.

206
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,860
Yeah,that's what we
call an armchair expert.

207
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,590
Honey,that is a world away
from actually doing it.

208
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,760
You remember-- first time I was on
the ice,- it was our second date.

209
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,520
How could I forget?

210
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,420
You were supposed to teach me.

211
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,130
Well,how could I?You were sprawled
out on the ice like Bambi...

212
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,510
and looking just as adorable.

213
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,650
Good save.

214
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,340
All right,this is what we're gonna
do.We're gonna start with the basics.

215
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,520
Then we're gonna move to Tonya Harding
and Nancy Kerrigan,hopefully by midnight.

216
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,570
Uh-huh,and then one day,I will
finally teach you how to skate.

217
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,170
Oh,no,you're gonna teach me how to
skate as soon as this case is over.

218
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,430
How do I look?

219
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,750
Like an FBI accountant.

220
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,340
Agent Gruetzner's conservative
attire is just an attempt to disguise

221
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,490
his subversive and
bohemian proclivities.

222
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,890
don't overplay this,Moz.It
is not dinner theatre.

223
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,950
You just need to answer
a few simple questions.

224
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,050
I'm a master improviser.

225
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,330
I will be the perfect
exigent supervisor.

226
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,730
That sounds familiar.

227
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,900
Yeah,it's not the first time
the suit's gotten under my skin.

228
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,190
I just heard from the
exigent supervisor.

229
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,360
Looks like Sergei wants to meet at a
vodka bar tomorrow,and that's a problem.

230
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,810
I need to be in Little Odessa at the same
time I promised Rebecca a meeting with you.

231
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,320
You say problem,I say opportunity.

232
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,940
You'll be off leash.

233
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,850
You can slip away,and big
brother will be none the wiser.

234
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,100
True.

235
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,640
Do we have an office yet?

236
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,370
Yeah,and it's not far.

237
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:41,940
Dr. Gravich,my former chiropractor and
hero to ambulance chasers everywhere

238
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,420
takes his entire staff out to lunch
from 1:00 until 2:00 every day.

239
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,940
A chiropractor's office?

240
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,910
With some posters and sundry
accoutrements,it'll look the part.

241
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,020
And to keep her from asking too many
questions,we can show her the Codex.

242
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,320
- She is a Mosconi expert.
- That's why she started working at the museum.

243
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,340
- Until you got her fired.

244
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,750
- Maybe she'll forgive us if we give
her a little peek at our chapter.

245
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:08,360
So you can reward her for your misdeed by
having her reward us with her information.

246
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,400
- Hello?

247
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,900
Here comes one of our accoutrements now.

248
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,650
Say hello to the Art Crimes
Division's comely receptionist.

249
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,660
FBI. May I help you?

250
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,750
All right.

251
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,250
All right,Jones and the tac team
are in a van a few blocks away.

252
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,590
Any closer and I think
it'd be too risky.

253
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,210
Yeah,no riskier than you
after half a bottle of vodka.

254
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,280
- What?
- Which is why I made these.

255
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,780
No,look-- no
tricks.- What?

256
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,250
- I can handle myself.
- Really?

257
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,920
- Yes.
- When was the last time you did a shot?

258
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,680
I don't-- It was
Hughes's retirement party.

259
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,050
- We did three of them.
- Ooh,three?

260
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,800
- Yes.
- Well,in Russia it's customary to drink until the bottle is empty.

261
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,230
Okay?This will keep us sober
without insulting Sergei.

262
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,860
I don't need your trick glasses.

263
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,980
No problem,but,uh,I probably
shouldn't walk in there with this.

264
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,120
Thank you.

265
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,810
He isn't here.

266
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,650
Neal Caffrey! You bastard.

267
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,710
I dated his sister. The ballerina.

268
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,140
Why does your love life
always end up affecting me?

269
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,090
Get him out of here
before he blows our cover.

270
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,010
- And wait for me right outside.

271
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,490
Dimitri!

272
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,380
- So good to see you.
- You never call my sister.

273
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,230
- I should kill you.
- All right,okay.

274
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,180
Take it easy now,all right?

275
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,120
You and I both know I was one of many.

276
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,260
What do you mean,One of
many""?"My sister is a saint.

277
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,620
- How was that?
- It was perfect.

278
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,020
- It could not have gone better.
- Was the accent too thick?

279
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,900
No,it wasn't.It was great.

280
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,740
You're gonna nail that
Fiddler On The Roof audition.

281
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,040
- Thanks.
- Break legs,kid.

282
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,630
Hey,I ditched the anklet
and Peter.I'm on my way.

283
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,380
Where is your fast-talking friend?

284
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,870
Oh,something urgent came up.

285
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,050
You know agents--
always putting out fires.

286
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,030
Uh,bring us the caviar,shashlik,and
a plate of pickled mushrooms.

287
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,430
- So,Peter Nevins.
- Yeah?

288
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,040
Figure skating coach to the stars.

289
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,600
Nikolai.

290
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,020
There is just one little problem.

291
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,150
What's that?

292
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,860
You don't seem to exist.

293
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,430
Now,how can you be
famous if you don't exist?

294
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,330
That's true.

295
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,940
Peter "Neevens" doesn't exist.

296
00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:02,490
But...Peter Nevins--
N-E-V-I-N-S-- he does.

297
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,190
It's an understandable mistake.

298
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,810
If I were put in front of a
cyrillic alphabet keyboard,

299
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,260
I'd-- Well,I wouldn't-- I wouldn't
be able to get past na zdorovie.

300
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,890
Na zdorovie.

301
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,680
You'd think Art Crimes would call for
a more aesthetically pleasing setup,

302
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,920
but we take a backseat to Wall Street.

303
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,180
Good afternoon,Agent Caffrey.

304
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,360
And this is June.

305
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,100
Our office couldn't
function without her.

306
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,680
- He's not exaggerating.

307
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,300
- Ms.Lowe.Agent Gruetzner.We've
been expecting you.

308
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,070
I filled Agent Gruetzner in on our talk.

309
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,600
I'm sorry for any problems
the Bureau may have caused.

310
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,420
I have the letter you
requested,along with my card,

311
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,410
in case any potential employers
need to call to verify.

312
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,560
Thank you.

313
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,480
but I'm still looking for closure.

314
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,310
I have some questions.

315
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,800
Could we,um,speak privately?

316
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,940
Actually,there's something
we'd like to talk to you about.

317
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,200
- You're married,yes?
- Yeah.

318
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,160
- Happily.
- That's good.

319
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,690
Because Katya is a
woman many men desire.

320
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,340
She once had a coach who was single.

321
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:22,810
They would spend hours practicing,often
late into the night.Very late.

322
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,090
He no longer skates so well.

323
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,570
Well,you should see what my wife
does to me when I miss dinner.

324
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,310
- That's good.
- Yeah.

325
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,970
- Well,sometimes.
- Yeah.

326
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,210
But the Codex has been hidden
away its entire existence.

327
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,330
The owner strictly forbade
anyone from opening it.

328
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,970
How-- how did
you get a copy?

329
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,370
That's classified.

330
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,870
I'm afraid you're on
a need-to-know basis.

331
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,180
As in,we need to know what you
know and not the other way around.

332
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:02,830
If you're willing,the FBI would like
your assistance deciphering its meaning.

333
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,950
It could help us solve
a very serious case.

334
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,110
There is one small matter that
you need to be made aware of.

335
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,370
There's a dangerous criminal who
wants the information in the Codex,

336
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,930
and we need to figure out why.

337
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,030
And time is of the essence.

338
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,850
You know what?You drink like Russian.

339
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,010
- Thank you.
- Well,almost.

340
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,050
You start tomorrow.

341
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,660
Tomorrow's good.

342
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,810
Good. Good.

343
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,830
Now,let me give you some advice.

344
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,590
Stay on the ice and out of my business.

345
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,110
Understood.

346
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,020
So a dangerous criminal is
interested in the Mosconi Codex?

347
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,700
We just wouldn't want to put you in harm's
way unless you knew what you were getting into.

348
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,830
The FBI will protect you.

349
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,970
Look,I know I might just seem like another
bookworm to you guys,but I can hold my own.

350
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,110
I just need time to think about it.

351
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,090
You have my card.Call with
your decision.Just make it soon.

352
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,260
- Every minute counts.
- I'll go down with you.

353
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,270
Thank you.

354
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,070
We got two minutes!

355
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,580
Neal?

356
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,540
Neal?

357
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,530
How'd it go?

358
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,900
I told you to wait right outside.

359
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,360
Yeah,I figured you could use
some coffee after all that vodka.

360
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,310
I found a great little place down
the street.Amazing Tula gingerbread.

361
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,330
- Are you inebriated?
- No,I'm not inebriated.

362
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,200
Here.Get the car.You're driving.

363
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,070
You know how alcohol tends to
amplify certain personality traits?

364
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,310
- Get the car,Neal.
- I'm on it.

365
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,060
Good work on that Peter Nevins bio.

366
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,130
It's a good thing they didn't
check five minutes earlier.

367
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,530
We were still uploading.

368
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,840
Neal took off,didn't he?

369
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,910
Yeah,he sure did.

370
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,650
I wanted to follow,but I didn't want
to leave you in there with Sergei.

371
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,810
Find out where he went.

372
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,040
Will do.

373
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,270
Morning.

374
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,090
- Time for breakfast?
- Uh,I'm running late.

375
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:44,490
I've got a stack of ASAC files
the size of an oddly shaped child.

376
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:51,440
You know,when we,um,we talked about
this job,I was actually thinking,"Wow...

377
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,220
"Predictable schedule.

378
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,030
Reasonable hours.

379
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,240
"And now it's back to late nights
and early mornings and vodka rooms.

380
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,590
To say nothing about the
figure skaters in short skirts.

381
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,960
Well,she's not my type.

382
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,130
I'm more into the Bambi kind of thing.

383
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,440
Mm,the uncoordinated limbs sprawled.

384
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,340
Exactly.

385
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,150
You okay?

386
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,820
Hon...

387
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,860
every day you're in the field...

388
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,560
every day,I...

389
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,320
I can't exhale until I hear you
walk through that door at night.

390
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,990
And I don't like that feeling.

391
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,050
Agent Siegel's murder was
a random act of violence.

392
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,440
Could have happened to anybody.

393
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,500
But it's not gonna happen to me.

394
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,510
I promise.

395
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,790
We good?

396
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,080
Can't wait to hear your
notes on how to improve that.

397
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,430
I don't have to give notes.

398
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,450
I only have to pretend to give notes.

399
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,040
Mm,kneeling at the anklet of
the master has taught you well.

400
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,910
The master is chewing gum?

401
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,270
I'm getting into character.

402
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,380
- I'm Neal Micali.

403
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,450
He chews gum when he's nervous.

404
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,720
I don't need a backstory.

405
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,480
I'm gonna go try to find
Sergei's passport workshop.

406
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,560
make it quick. Sergei doesn't
like anyone nosing around.

407
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,900
Save your coaching for the ice.

408
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,180
You ready,coach?

409
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,480
Yeah.

410
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,700
You can trust us.

411
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,810
But you have to tell me
everything about Sergei's business.

412
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,850
All I know is that he brings
terrible people to Little Odessa.

413
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,830
He wants to control it.

414
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,650
Everyone is scared of him.

415
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,380
Then why are you with him?

416
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,500
In the beginning,he was a good man.

417
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,170
I moved from Moscow to be with him.

418
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,650
Now he treats me like possession.

419
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,560
Last week,he thought I cheated on him.

420
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,200
So he... hit me.

421
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,770
And the next day,like nothing
happened,he asks me to marry him.

422
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,030
What did you say?

423
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,710
If I say yes...

424
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,930
I'll be miserable forever.

425
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,320
And if I say no...

426
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,530
I'm dead.

427
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,560
You're my coach.

428
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,230
You have advice?

429
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,200
Piotr!

430
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,910
Sergei.

431
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,260
I didn't expect you here so early.

432
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,490
You think I could just let you coach the
love of my life without a little observation?

433
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,160
I'm curious to know what you think.

434
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,860
So Katya's had trouble
executing her salchow.

435
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,800
In my opinion,the problem is her center of
gravity when she lands on the inside edge.

436
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,670
Well,that would be a problem.

437
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,100
The salchow always lands
on the outside edge.

438
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,000
All she needs is a slight adjustment.

439
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,530
The extension of her free foot on the
three spin tends to be a bit shallow.

440
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,970
Okay.Work your magic.

441
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,710
Now,listen,make sure that
you keep that extension long.

442
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,220
Think long.

443
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,330
Go skate.

444
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,980
Trust yourself,all right?

445
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,560
Don't forget to keep an eye on this guy.

446
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,810
And push.

447
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,720
Not bad. Not bad.

448
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,760
But not perfect either.

449
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,920
In competition,you gotta be flawless.

450
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,770
We'll keep working on it.

451
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,450
Don't go easy on her.She
needs to learn discipline.

452
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,130
Uh,Sergei.I got my
hockey skates in the bag.

453
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,850
Katya can take a break while
I give you a few pointers.

454
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:38,200
That's why you Americans are losing
your edge.All play and no work.

455
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,830
Oh,okay.I get it,I get it.

456
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,950
You don't want a repeat
of miracle on ice.

457
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,720
The US kicks Russia's ass again.

458
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,270
That's an open wound for
many of my countrymen,Peter.

459
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,240
- Get my skates. See you on the ice.
- Excellent.

460
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,920
Bingo.

461
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:36,130
Jack,that is the same line that you sold
Katarina...in Brussels in '97,all right?

462
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,330
- Hey,you.- Hey,my cell phone
died.All right?Can I-- Do you mind?

463
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,260
Hey,pal,listen,I'm jetlagged,all right?

464
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,570
So let's close this out,or I'm
gonna have to call your competition.

465
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,030
Out.Now.

466
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:47,830
Do you know what this is?

467
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,410
It's a deal memo for Katya.

468
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:55,770
A generous salary,bonuses and
bumps,travel,food,lodging,wardrobe.Now,get lost.

469
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,050
Or you can explain to Sergei why Katya
will be crying into her sequins all night.

470
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,850
Yeah,I'm back.Sorry.

471
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,310
Hold on,Jack.

472
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,320
Two minutes.I come back,you be gone.

473
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,410
All right.

474
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,800
Yeah.Yeah,I'm still here.

475
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,640
Just,uh,cleaning my ears
out from all the manure

476
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,160
you've been shoveling into
them for the last ten minutes.

477
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,250
Oh,it's nice showing you how it's done.

478
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,630
Four out of five,Peter.

479
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,230
- I wish you good luck.
- Thank you.

480
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,900
Keep your eye on the puck.

481
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,930
That's one.

482
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,090
Not too bad.

483
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,860
But we're playing best of three.

484
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,590
Oh,let's make it best of five.

485
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,170
Vanya.

486
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,450
Seryozha.

487
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,690
What the hell was that?

488
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,940
That one got away.

489
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,240
You know what? You're a crazy person.

490
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,290
But I like that.

491
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,690
I'll finish with you tomorrow.I
have business to take care of.

492
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,400
Ivan made bail.

493
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,740
Why wasn't I told about this?

494
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,910
The court dropped the ball.

495
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,270
Someone didn't get the memo that
we've got an open investigation.

496
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,050
By the way,Gretzky,did you mean
for the puck to hit the wall,

497
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,600
or were you trying to
hit Sergei and missed?

498
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,040
You should come to the firing range.

499
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,290
- Trust me. He never misses.
- Thank you.

500
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,890
The names on the printout Neal grabbed match
fugitives on the Russian intel watch list.

501
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,080
Calls between the ice rink and
Moscow shot up in the past week.

502
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,270
Looks like Sergei's
bringing in new recruits.

503
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,950
They'll be untraceable the minute they get through customs with new identities.
- Yes?

504
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,280
So if we don't crack
Sergei's network soon,

505
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,300
a bunch of hardened Russian criminals
will go into the wind on US soil.

506
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,870
Seems like enough of them
already have. Come on.

507
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,050
Ivan was pulled out of the
East River this morning by NYPD.

508
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,720
They didn't trust him not to talk.

509
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:02,310
Russian intelligence agreed to extradite all
of Sergei's men who were already in New York.

510
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:06,410
With the clean passports,they're
gonna be almost impossible to find.

511
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,640
We've dealt with money laundering
before,but Sergei's laundering people.

512
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:15,610
So...how do we round up a bunch of fearless
Russians who are scattered throughout the city?

513
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,840
Before they tip each other off.

514
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,370
It's gonna take a lot of manpower and a lot
of preparation,and we're running out of time.

515
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,050
What if Sergei brings him to us?

516
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,600
I'm listening.

517
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,470
Well,what's the one thing
his guys can't resist?

518
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,780
An excuse to party.

519
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,730
So let's give them
something to celebrate.

520
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:32,770
Okay.

521
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:36,650
Maybe provide Sergei with the answer
- he's been waiting for. - Katya?

522
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,020
What kind of fiance would he be if
he didn't throw a party to celebrate -

523
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,590
the happiest day of his life?
- Nice.

524
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,570
He would not be a good
one. That's excellent.

525
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,400
We put them all together in
one place at the same time,

526
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,360
and we put an end to Sergei's
grip on Little Odessa.

527
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,000
I'll do it.

528
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,860
All right,Katya,I will make
sure that nothing happens to you.

529
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,870
But I need to know from you
if you are really up for this.

530
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,280
I woke up at 5:00 every
morning as a child.

531
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,060
Walked to the gym in
the snow six miles away.

532
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,390
At practice,my toes bled in my skates.

533
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,490
But I put on a smile every day.

534
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,620
This is nothing.

535
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,110
Sergei!

536
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,200
Peter helped me see
how stupid I have been.

537
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,080
I can't believe it has taken me so long.

538
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,330
Yes...

539
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,420
I will marry you!

540
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,200
Tonight,we celebrate.

541
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,590
He has a lot of friends.

542
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,830
They can't all be criminals.

543
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,850
We'll do some weeding at headquarters.

544
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,690
Peter!

545
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,910
Come here.

546
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:23,210
I'm so glad you could make it. I
was hoping to meet your lovely wife.

547
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,490
Ah,she sends her regrets.
She came down with the flu.

548
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,870
Ah,too bad. Maybe at the wedding.
- Maybe.

549
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,180
Your cousin isn't sticking
around for the celebration?

550
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,460
Life is a place of
service.Do you read Tolstoy?

551
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,130
Ah,War And Peace,one of my favorites.

552
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,690
Ah,enough talk.

553
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,230
Let's celebrate.

554
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,990
Nikolai's leaving.

555
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,390
Stall him.

556
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,670
- I want him to be here for her engagement present.
- But I'll miss your speech.

557
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,620
- I'll make sure somebody records it.
- You better.

558
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,950
Uh,excuse me.Excuse
me.I'm sorry. Excuse me.

559
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,240
I'm Peter Nevins.

560
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,710
None of you know me,but
I am Katya's coach.

561
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:15,340
And I just want to congratulate my new friend
Sergei and his lovely,talented fiance Katya.

562
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,450
Hey,buddy!

563
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,710
It's Neal Micali.

564
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,460
Come on,the party's just getting
started. Where's the fire,my man?

565
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,170
Hey,I feel like we
got off to a bad start.

566
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,490
How about you and me go back up there,have
a shot or three-- What do you say?

567
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:38,260
So what I'm really trying to say is,it's
good to put all these names to faces.

568
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,850
So raise a glass.

569
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,040
Oh,one other thing.

570
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,230
You're all under arrest.

571
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,290
FBI!Nobody move!Hands in the air!

572
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,590
- Get down!

573
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,880
You're no sport agent.

574
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,120
Yeah,and you're not
Sammy Jordache？Really?

575
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,410
- Don't even think about it.

576
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,820
Back away.

577
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,900
- Just put it down right now.
- Back away.

578
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,700
- Put that knife down right now!
-I'm taking her with me!

579
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,140
You got five guns on you
right now!Put it down!

580
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,800
You okay?

581
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,710
You were right.

582
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,280
Peter Nevins doesn't exist.

583
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,020
By the looks of it...

584
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,880
neither do any of these people.

585
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,550
Remember my face.

586
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,430
Get him out of here.

587
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,030
So...

588
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,730
- off to Innsbruck.
- Yes.

589
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,240
- That should be an adventure,huh?
- Oh,I hope so.

590
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,630
Any last advice,coach?

591
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,320
Watch your leading
edge on the double axel

592
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,900
and be sure to not lock your
knees on the Biellmann spin.

593
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,580
Oh,you have no idea what
any of that means,do you?

594
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,740
No.A commentator once said it on
my research DVDs.It sounded good.

595
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,710
Thank you.

596
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,500
Sure.

597
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,380
Good luck.

598
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,340
- I'll walk you out.
- Thank you.

599
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,860
Bye.

600
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,230
What'd you find?

601
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,250
Surveillance cameras a block from
the vodka room led us to a cabbie.

602
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,080
He picked them up and brought them in.

603
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,820
Anything special about the place?

604
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,600
Nah,it's just your
average office building.

605
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,360
Accountants,therapists,nothing
out of the ordinary.

606
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,530
Is there any reason he'd
slip away to come here?

607
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,700
Neal always has a reason.

608
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,540
You can pull the ripcord
on your safety chute.

609
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,010
Rebecca just called on the burner phone.

610
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,110
Really?What did she say?

611
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,670
Do I detect a lilt in your voice?

612
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,350
Agent Gruetzner sees all.

613
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,270
You like her.

614
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,880
What is this,sixth grade?

615
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,570
Personally,I don't see the attraction.

616
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:18,640
She doesn't want to rob you or arrest
you or charge you with insurance fraud.

617
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,340
Just tell me what she said.

618
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,520
She wants to meet at the Rare Book Room.

619
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,710
You know,there's nothing more
enchanting than a beautiful woman

620
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:31,080
cradling a classic opus
in her soft,gentle hands.

621
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,440
Would you like to take
the lead on this one?

622
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,130
No,you're the front man.I'm
merely rhythm guitar.

623
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,700
Yeah,well,so was John Lennon.

624
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,110
Thank you for that.

625
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,730
Leave your heart off your sleeve.

626
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,770
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

627
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,840
Uh,just a routine call.

628
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,870
We're checking all the
offices in the area.

629
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,920
Anything unusual occur here
in the last couple days?

630
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,810
Not unless you consider a room
full of herniated discs unusual.

631
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,790
Mind if I poke around?

632
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,520
Honey,you go ahead and poke.

633
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,210
Hello,Dr.Gravich's
office.How can I help you?

634
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,570
Well,what seems to be the problem?

635
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,550
how's Thursday?He's here
from 10:00 AM till 5:00.

636
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
Okay.

637
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,110
You mind if I read over your shoulder?

638
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,480
it's not exactly light reading.

639
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,660
- Oh,Mosconi.
- Yeah.

640
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,760
I figured we
could,um,start our research.

641
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,570
Does that mean you've
come to a decision?

642
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,700
Yes,it does.

643
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,270
I will help you with the Codex.

644
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,950
- but...I should tell you something first,just so you know.
- Tell me.

645
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,970
I,um...I did time.

646
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,840
Really?

647
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:45,430
I was 19.It was a semester in Marrakesh.

648
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:51,390
So I'm in the Menara Gardens,and
there was this beautiful green tile.

649
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,910
What,in the Saadian Pavilion?

650
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,560
Yes.

651
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:59,390
So it had fallen off the
roof,and I pocketed it.

652
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:05,280
And I always meant to take it back,and then when I tried...
- You got pinched.

653
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,050
It was the scariest night of my life.

654
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,810
Um,I'm sorry,"Night"?Singular?

655
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,470
- Believe me...
- One night in jail?

656
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,700
- One night in a Moroccan prison is enough.
- All right.

657
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,910
Look...we've worked
with ex-cons before.

658
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:27,480
Even seasoned,hardened
criminals,like yourself.

659
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,340
Did you have a prison bitch?

660
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:33,840
Sorry.

661
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,570
And,in the interest
of full disclosure,I...

662
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,130
Look our copy of the
Codex is incomplete.

663
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,080
How much do you have?

664
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,740
A single chapter.It's chapter 13.

665
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,420
Does that mean anything to you?

666
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,050
- You know what?
- What?

667
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,500
I'm done with games.

668
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,960
Games?What are you talking about?

669
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,680
I-- Did I say--
What did I say?

670
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,820
Go ahead.Open it.Chapter 13.

671
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,350
No luck?

672
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,760
Try this one.

673
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:23,070
Mosconi was incredibly superstitious.

674
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,430
In all the books he ever
produced,he never wrote a chapter 13.

675
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,950
That's it.

676
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,690
You're getting your sea legs back.

677
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
Frozen sea legs.

678
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,950
Is it really okay that we're doing this?

679
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,890
Well,technically,it's a crime scene,so don't touch anything.
- Okay.

680
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,620
All right,tell me how to turn again.

681
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,440
- All right,just put pressure on the outside blade And lean.
- Yes.

682
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,240
Oh,like that!

683
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,790
- There you go.
- Yeah!

684
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,970
- Good.-
Wait,wait-- whoa!

685
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,390
I got you.I got you.

686
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,270
- Okay.
- I got you.

687
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,630
Yeah.You always do.

688
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,690
Okay.

689
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,110
Kind of like our second date.

690
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:31,710
Little better.
