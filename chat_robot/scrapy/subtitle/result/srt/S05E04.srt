1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,400
你在说什么
what are you talking about?

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,030
我跟你说
i'm telling you,

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,270
她不让我见他
she's hiding him from me.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,430
她没有藏着他
she's not hiding him.

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,600
是吗
oh yeah?

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,840
每次我去见他
every time i go to see him,

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,100
她都说他刚安顿好
she tells me that he's just settled down.

8
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,770
你能怪她吗  是你没抓牢他
can you blame her? you dropped him.

9
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,910
不是我干的  他自己摔倒的
i did not drop him, he jumped.

10
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,140
摔倒?
jumped?

11
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,310
好吧  是他从我的怀里滑出去的
well, he wiggled out of my arms.

12
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,340
我已经道过歉了
i said i was sorry.

13
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,480
而且我有造成多少损失么
besides, how much damage could i possibly have done?

14
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,510
他摔了个大马趴
he fell, like, maybe two feet.

15
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,380
这事很常见的
stuff like that happens all the time.

16
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,450
我是说  当我还小时
i mean, i was dropped like, a dozen times

17
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,520
都被扔出过好多次
when i was a kid.

18
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,720
那就是原因所在
well, that explains a lot.

19
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,190
你在介意什么  你甚至都不喜欢小孩子
why do you even care? you don't even like kids.

20
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,420
这是原则问题
it's the principle of the thing.

21
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,260
每个人都能抱他  我为什么就不行
everybody else gets to hold him. why shouldn't i?

22
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,830
中校...
colonel...

23
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:34,930
我们收到新信号
we've got a new contact.

24
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,430
像是一艘战舰
looks like a ship.

25
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,560
相距多远
how far out?

26
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,130
已进入轨道内
it's in orbit.

27
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,330
可是  我们怎么没有侦测到它
well, how come we didn't detect it?

28
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,430
我不清楚
i don't know.

29
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,900
我们甚至没有探测到超空间窗口
we didn't even detect a hyperspace window.

30
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,070
它就这么突然冒出来了
it just appeared out of nowhere.

31
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,470
稍等  我们收到敌我识别信号了
hang on a second, we're getting i.f.f.

32
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,940
是代达罗斯号
it's the daedalus.

33
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,210
代达罗斯号?  怎么可能?
the  daedalus? how can that be?

34
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,810
他们正在返回地球
they're on their way back to earth.

35
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,310
是的  他们应该在路上
well, they were. they were supposed to be.

36
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,850
打开一个频道
open up a channel.

37
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,150
代达罗斯号  这里是亚特兰蒂斯  请接入
daedalus, this is atlantis, please come in.

38
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,160
代达罗斯号  请回复
daedalus, please respond.

39
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,760
他们不会回复的
they're not going to answer.

40
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,160
为什么不会?
why not?

41
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,630
我没发现任何生命信号
because i'm not reading any lifesigns.

42
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,030
你想告诉我什么  罗德尼
what are you telling me, rodney,

43
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,530
这飞船自己控制飞行?
this thing flew here by itself?

44
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,600
我不知道它是怎样到这里的
i don't know how they got here,

45
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,040
但是那上面空无一人
but there's no one on board.

46
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,940
至少是没一个活人
at least, no one alive.

47
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,870
中校  我们刚从星门指挥部
colonel, we just got confirmation

48
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,110
得到确认消息
from stargate command.

49
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,680
代达罗斯号正在银河中
the  daedalus is in the milky way,

50
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,080
按照原定计划
on course and on schedule.

51
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,210
有望在两天内到达地球
they expect to reach earth within two days.

52
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,980
明白
understood.

53
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,720
看来那不是代达罗斯号
so that's not the  daedalus, then.

54
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,290
好吧...
well...

55
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,520
除非它有分身之术
not unless it can be in two places at once.

56
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,730
也许是阿波罗号  或者是其他的飞船
perhaps the  apollo, or one of your other ships...

57
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,130
那它就不会发送代达罗斯号的敌我识别信号
they wouldn't be sending  daedalus i.f.f.,

58
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,490
更何况也无法解释它是如何到这的
plus it doesn't explain how they got here,

59
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,360
以及为何侦测不到生命信号
or why we're not picking up lifesign readings.

60
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,200
那好吧
all right,

61
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,300
我们凑近点看看
i'm taking us in for a closer look.

62
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,520
你看见那个没?
wow, you see that?

63
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,160
有许多焦灼痕迹
yeah, some scorch marks.

64
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
你认为是武器攻击的?
you think weaponsfire?

65
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,390
不管它经历过什么
well, wherever she's been,

66
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,560
肯定是历尽艰险
she's been through some pretty hard times.

67
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,500
那是什么
what's that?

68
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
我收到了能量读数
i'm picking up an energy reading.

69
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,670
是来自那飞船的
it's coming from the ship.

70
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,670
有危险吗
is it dangerous?

71
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,440
我不认为有
i don't think so,

72
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,070
但我不清楚是什么引起的
but i have no idea what's causing it.

73
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,270
你能打开停泊舱门吗?
can you get the bay doors open?

74
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,380
应该没问题
if the ship's command systems

75
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,880
只要飞船的控制系统
are as familiar as the rest of it,

76
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,550
和其他系统一样简单
it shouldn't be a problem.

77
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,430
不是f302型
no f-302s,

78
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,430
但是有一个小飞船
but there's a jumper.

79
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,630
你确定里面没人吗
you sure there's no one else inside?

80
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,270
目前为止是的
as far as i can tell.

81
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,500
好的  我们进去
all right, we're going in.

82
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,060
为什么这里面这么冷
why is it so cold in here?

83
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,760
飞船的运作要靠能源
the ship's operating on emergency power.

84
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,800
有些系统根本没有启动
some of the systems are barely registering.

85
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,960
除了那个奇怪的能量源
except for the whole weird energy thing.

86
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,930
说的对
that's right.

87
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,030
有什么办法吗
can you do something about it?

88
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,130
这里冻死了
it's freezing in here.

89
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,700
当然  我需要去下工程舱
oh, sure, i just have to get to engineering.

90
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,140
你和若楠一起
you and ronon are together.

91
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,940
泰勒  你和我去舰桥看看
teyla, you and i are going to check out the bridge.

92
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,780
有任何发现就用无线电联系我
radio me if you find anything.

93
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,560
这里空无一人...
no bodies in here.

94
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,700
中校...
colonel...

95
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,670
这是代达罗斯号  没错
it's the  daedalus , all right.

96
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,340
麦凯  是你弄的吗
mckay, is that you?

97
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,250
当然了  还会是谁?
of course it was me. who else would it be?

98
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,550
难道你认为这里有鬼还是什么
you think we've got a ghost on board or something?

99
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,650
不要乱动任何东西!
will you please not touch anything!

100
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,820
我们的情况如何
what's our status?

101
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,490
我恢复了飞船的大部分基础能量
i've restored basic power to most of the ship.

102
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,290
飞船立刻就会恢复能源
it should be warming up any second now.

103
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,360
很好
good.

104
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,330
检查那个能量读数
check on that energy reading.

105
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,330
看看到底是什么意思
try to figure out what it is, all right?

106
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,730
我正在查
i'm on it.

107
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,070
中校...
colonel...

108
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,840
飞船日志  最后一次记录
ship's log, last entry.

109
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,650
准备基本完毕
preparations are almost complete.

110
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,250
已经传送下最后的补给
we've beamed down the last of our supplies,

111
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,520
以及任何我们可能需要的装备
and any equipment we think might be useful.

112
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,620
我会自己携带最后的f302
i'll be taking the last of the f-302s down myself.

113
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,460
当然  我们没有时间
of course, we haven't had time

114
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,220
对行星表面进行详细调查
to do a proper survey of the planet's surface,

115
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,930
但是似乎相当适合居住
but it seems habitable enough.

116
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,090
淡水充足  土壤肥沃
plenty of fresh water, arable soil,

117
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,500
与地球十分相似
not that different from our own.

118
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,600
我意识到我们被援救的机会微乎其微
i realize our chance of rescue is slim,

119
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,470
但是事实很明显
but it's become obvious

120
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,600
我们已别无选择
that we no longer have a choice.

121
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,170
我是索博上校  代达罗斯号指挥官
this is colonel sobol, commander of the  daedalus ,

122
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,610
信号终止
signing off.

123
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,140
你认识她?
do you recognize her?

124
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,580
我以前从未见过她
i've never seen her before in my life.

125
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,250
看来他们弃船了
well, it appears as if they abandoned ship.

126
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,320
对
yeah.

127
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,180
可是到底为什么
the question is, why?

128
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,820
我来看下之前的记录
i'll check previous entries.

129
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,160
天哪  这飞船跟被大卸八块似的
man, this ship has been through the wringer.

130
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,460
没有超空间引擎
no hyperdrive,

131
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,200
亚空间通信装备损坏得无法修复
subspace communications are all damaged beyond repair,

132
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,070
护盾不堪一击
the shields are virtually depleted...

133
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,340
那是什么
what is it?

134
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,640
是能量读数
it's the energy reading.

135
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,840
它在脉冲
it's spiking.

136
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,310
谢帕德  请接入
sheppard, come in.

137
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,510
请讲
go ahead.

138
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,980
情况不妙
something's happening.

139
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,510
能量读数正高出图表
the energy reading, it's going off the charts.

140
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,450
做点什么  把它关掉
do something. turn it off.

141
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,080
我不知道怎么关掉
i don't know how.

142
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,750
它不是从任何主系统发出的
look, it's not coming from any of the main systems.

143
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,090
谢帕徳中校  这里是亚特兰蒂斯
colonel sheppard, this is atlantis.

144
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,090
我们收到巨大的能量信号
we're picking up some kind of power surge

145
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,690
是从飞船上发出的
coming from the ship.

146
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,020
是的  我们注意到了
yeah, we noticed it.

147
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,460
我们正试着自己把它找出来
we're trying to check it out ourselves.

148
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,860
能量等级正不断抬升
the levels are still rising.

149
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,630
中校  需要我们派出另一艘飞船支援吗
colonel, should we send another jumper to assist?

150
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,970
待命
stand by.

151
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,380
好吧  我们开始撤离
all right, that's our cue to leave.

152
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,740
所有人回到飞船内
everyone, back in the jumper.

153
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,050
麦凯  那他妈的是什么
mckay, what the hell was that?

154
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,350
我不知道  但是...
i have no idea, but...

155
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,560
能量读数恢复初始了
the energy reading's gone back down the way it was.

156
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,600
亚特兰蒂斯   发现任何异常迹象吗
atlantis, you reading anything unusual?

157
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,000
亚特兰蒂斯  请接入
atlantis, come in.

158
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,140
亚特兰蒂斯  收得到信号吗
atlantis, do you read?

159
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,510
谢帕徳中校  收到信号吗
colonel sheppard, do you read?

160
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:15,710
代达罗斯号  请回复  这里是亚特兰蒂斯
daedalus , this is atlantis, please respond.

161
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,350
到底发生什么了
what the hell's going on?

162
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,620
我不知道
i don't know.

163
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,750
上一刻他们还在
one moment they were there,

164
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,420
下一刻就消失了
the next minute, they were gone.

165
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,920
罗德尼?
rodney?

166
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,060
我们的通讯有问题
i'm having problems with communications.

167
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,990
我无法与亚特兰蒂斯号取得联系
i can't reach atlantis.

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,930
稍等
wait a second.

169
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,830
这不对劲啊
that can't be right.

170
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,530
什么
what?

171
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,370
我在屏幕上看不到任何城市
i'm not seeing the city on any of my screens.

172
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,310
你在说什么
what are you talking about?

173
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,810
我刚进行了传感器扫描
i just did a sensor sweep,

174
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,310
发现下面只有一片汪洋大海
and there's nothing down there but ocean.

175
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,040
也许他们隐蔽起来了
well, maybe they cloaked.

176
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,850
他们不可能不通知我们一声啊
well, they wouldn't have done that without telling us.

177
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,010
我也不知道
well, i don't know,

178
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,920
也许那里有一艘幽灵飞船
maybe there's a wraith ship in the area.

179
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,050
我什么都没发现
i'm not reading anything.

180
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,120
我们还是在同一个星球上吗
are we certain it's the same planet?

181
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,060
也许是能量爆发使我们的位置偏移了
perhaps the energy burst shifted our position.

182
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,120
不会  根据我们的仪器检测
no, according to our instruments,

183
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,530
我们根本没有动
we haven't moved at all.

184
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,890
那你要让我怎么想  罗德尼
what do you want me to believe, rodney?

185
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,290
亚特兰蒂斯就这么消失了?
that atlantis just disappeared?

186
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,760
听着  我不知道
look, i don't know.

187
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,200
给我点时间  我会弄明白的  好吗
just give me a second, i'll figure it out, all right?

188
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,230
同时  我会设法定位出
in the meantime, i've managed to localize

189
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,130
能量读取的来源
the source of the energy reading.

190
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,200
是来自于9号甲板的一个舱位
it's coming from a hold on deck 9.

191
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,370
好吧  继续和亚特兰蒂斯联系
all right, keep trying to reach atlantis.

192
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,040
我们去看一下
we'll check it out.

193
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,520
谢帕德  我想我发现了什么
sheppard, i think i've got something.

194
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,160
是刚才那次闪光的辐射残余
it's the residual radiation from the flash.

195
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,630
和打开超空间飞行窗口的情况有些类似
it's similar to what happens when you open a hyperspace window,

196
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,130
但又有所不同
but different enough

197
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,690
因为传感器不会自动加速的
that the sensors wouldn't have picked it up automatically.

198
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,160
那是什么意思
what the hell does that mean?

199
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,130
我想我们经历的是一种新的推进方式
i think we're looking at a new kind of drive.

200
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,430
我记得你说过我们根本没有移动过
i thought you said we didn't go anywhere.

201
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,800
我们是没有
we didn't.

202
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,070
至少从飞船的导航系统来看是没有
at least not according to the ship's navigational systems.

203
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,210
那么是一次故障性推进?
so, a malfunctioning drive?

204
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,240
或许吧
maybe.

205
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,740
稍等下
just hang on.

206
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,150
天啊  谢帕德
oh, my god, sheppard--

207
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,960
镇定点  罗德尼
stand by, rodney.

208
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,460
不  你没明白  我知道怎么回事了
no, you don't understand, i know what it is.

209
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,820
听着  那些辐射残余
look, the residual radiation.

210
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,630
正是我们从外空间
it's exactly what we recorded

211
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,500
两次到达亚特兰蒂斯
when my double arrived on atlantis

212
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,000
所记录的能源
from an alternate reality.

213
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,260
真不敢相信我以前没有注意到
i can't believe i didn't see this before.

214
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,770
谢帕德
sheppard, hey.

215
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,670
这的确是一次推进
it's a drive all right,

216
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,170
但并没有在空间里进行
but it didn't move us through space.

217
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,140
我想我们进入的是一个平行宇宙
i think it's moved us into a parallel universe.

218
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:25,210
这就可以解释很多事情了
that would explain a lot of things.

219
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,070
他们死了有多久了
how long have they been dead for?

220
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,770
这里就像一个储肉柜
this place was like a meat locker.

221
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,480
他们可能已经这样保存了几个月了
they could've been preserved like this for months.

222
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,180
他们看起来可真像我们
they look just like us.

223
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,780
那是因为就是我们
that's because they are us--

224
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,480
另一个时空的我们
the alternate reality versions of us.

225
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,820
我感觉就像有人走进了我们的墓地
i feel like someone just walked over my grave.

226
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,220
放松  一切都很好
take it easy. everything's fine.

227
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,320
不不  这很糟
oh, no, no, no, this is very bad.

228
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,420
什么
what?

229
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,130
这个手写板是另一个麦凯的
this tablet belonged to the other mckay.

230
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,590
他们也不是原来这里的船员
they weren't part of the original crew.

231
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,230
他们像我们一样来到这
they came here just like us.

232
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,900
听着  亚特兰蒂斯上空的轨道上
look, a ship appeared in orbit

233
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,000
出现了一艘飞船
above their atlantis,

234
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,230
他们是上来查看的
they came to check it out.

235
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,530
这就可以解释
that would explain

236
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,740
港口的另一艘飞船
the other jumper in the bay.

237
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,900
这艘飞船进入了另一个时空
the ship jumped to another reality,

238
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,640
而且他们被困在那  无法返航
and they were stuck, they couldn't get back.

239
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,640
听着  到最后
look, eventually

240
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,610
他们的补给耗光了
their supplies ran out,

241
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,970
他们就...
and they...

242
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,340
好了  好了  谜底揭开了
all right, all right, mystery solved.

243
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,780
我们得行动了
let's move on.

244
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,180
你没意识到这代表什么吗
don't you realize what this means?

245
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,480
他们就是我们  而且他们失败了
they were us, and they failed.

246
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,850
他们可不是我们
well, they're not us.

247
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,320
我们还活的好好的
we're still alive.

248
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,380
走吧
let's go.

249
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,030
答案就在这附近
the answer's in here somewhere.

250
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,260
可以把这的系统启动吗
can you power up the systems?

251
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,630
可以  稍等一下
uh... yeah, just hold on.

252
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,470
好了
all right...

253
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,610
好吧  开始了
all right, that's a start.

254
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,280
那后面是什么
what's behind here?

255
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,350
问的好
that's a good question.

256
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,440
我想这就是我们变换时空的推进装置
i'm guessing that's our alternate reality drive.

257
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,810
你能弄明白如何操控它吗
can you figure out how to control it?

258
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,280
唐突的说  我不能
offhand, i'd say no.

259
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,050
这是另一个麦凯一直试图弄明白的
that's what the other mckay was trying to do,

260
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,710
而且他用了...  好几周的时间
and he had... weeks.

261
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,080
罗德尼
rodney...

262
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,190
好吧
fine.

263
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,890
我从他的研究成果开始
i'll start with his research.

264
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,860
至少我们在开头领先了
it'll at least give us a head start.

265
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,860
这就好多了
that's better.

266
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,020
我们去找些补给
we're going to go look for supplies.

267
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,230
你认为另一个时空的我们
you don't think the other us

268
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,830
没有试过吗
wouldn't have already tried that?

269
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,560
干活去
get to work.

270
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,410
有发现吗
did you find anything?

271
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,050
没有  除非你知道这东西怎么吃
not unless you know a way to cook this.

272
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,150
也许我们应该考虑降落到星球上
perhaps we should consider going down to the planet

273
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,920
去搜集补给
to collect supplies.

274
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,020
谢帕德说这太冒险了
sheppard says it's too risky.

275
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,420
推进或许会再次发生
the drive could kick in,

276
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,260
飞船会自行起飞
and the ship could take off without us.

277
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,630
那我们就被困在这了
then we'd be stuck here.

278
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,300
我们发现的那些自己
the others that we found...

279
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,400
你觉得他们的生活和我们很相似吗
do you think their lives were very similar to ours?

280
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,500
谁在乎这个
who cares?

281
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,640
你怎么能这么说
how can you say that?

282
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,270
我们以前见过更多的自己
we've seen our doubles before.

283
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,140
那是人造的复制品
replicator-manufactured copies.

284
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,180
但他们是真正的人类  有真正的生命
these were real people, with real lives.

285
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,350
我忍不住去想
i can't help but wondering

286
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,480
会是谁在亚特兰蒂斯
who might still be waiting for her

287
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,650
等待她归来
back on her atlantis.

288
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,320
你意思是  她也有个儿子?
do you mean, did she also have a son?

289
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,960
这念头刚刚一闪而过
the thought had crossed my mind.

290
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,860
听着
look...

291
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,930
我已经听麦凯讲过这种事情了
i've heard mckay talk about this stuff before,

292
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,500
照这么假设的话
and supposedly,

293
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,100
有百万个不同的时空
there's a million different realities out there,

294
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,070
每一个时空都有可能出现各种变化
with every possible variation.

295
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,270
也就是说
which also means

296
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,570
会有百万个不同的图门
there's a million different torrens.

297
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,340
那么你还会去担心他们每一个人吗
you going to worry about every one of them?

298
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,110
不会
no.

299
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,210
担心一个就已经够麻烦了
it's difficult enough worrying about one.

300
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,120
我想也是
i'll bet it is.

301
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,180
来吧
come on.

302
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,760
防爆门怎么关上了
why is the blast door closed?

303
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,830
记得吗  有辐射残余
hello? residual radiation?

304
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,500
哦对
oh, right.

305
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,230
你有什么进展了吗
have you made any progress?

306
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,440
事实上
as a matter of fact,

307
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
是的  我们有了
yes, we have.

308
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
我们?
we?

309
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,510
我和另一个麦凯
me and the other mckay,

310
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,070
而他  毫无惊讶地也是个天才
who, unsurprisingly, is a genius.

311
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,140
不仅如此
not only that,

312
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,310
而且这个推进装置看来是由
but it looks like the drive was created

313
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,780
最初船上的那个麦凯制造的
by yet another mckay from the original reality.

314
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,010
为什么这么说
what makes you say that?

315
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,280
因为我发现有某种
well, there's a certain, um,

316
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,450
我所熟识的精巧设计
elegance to the design that i recognize.

317
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,620
我肯定当船员弃船逃生的时候
i'm sure that's what the crew was saying

318
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,790
他们也是这么说的
when they abandoned ship.

319
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,290
不可否认这里确实有些问题
well, admittedly there are problems,

320
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,290
但仍然算是一项伟大的发明
but it is still a monumental achievement.

321
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,760
那么我们该怎么做
so, what do we do?

322
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,730
我们可以直接让它反向运行吗
can we just throw this thing in reverse?

323
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,300
是啊  比那还要再复杂些
uh, yeah, it's a little more complicated than that.

324
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,000
第一个问题是导航装置
the first problem is navigation.

325
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
他们开发了一种坐标系统
they've developed a coordinate system

326
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,070
来区分不同的时空
to identify the various realities

327
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,140
以使他们可以来去自由
and allow them to get back,

328
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,540
但很明显这不管用
but obviously that didn't work.

329
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,710
显而易见
obviously.

330
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,480
这还不是让我烦心的
that's not what bothers me.

331
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,010
这有点让我烦心了
well, it kind of bothers me.

332
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,310
是能源系统
it's power generation,

333
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,210
从一个时空向另一个时空跃迁
and jumping from one reality to another

334
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,920
需要巨大的能量
requires massive amounts of power.

335
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,550
我们说的可是零点装置级别的
we're talking zpm levels here.

336
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,890
很明显他们没有足够的能量来回传着玩
obviously they didn't have one of those rattling around,

337
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,550
所以他们造了一种电容器
so they created a capacitor

338
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,490
来不断地从亚空间抽取能量
that's constantly drawing power from subspace.

339
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,860
看起来似乎能量快充满了
and it looks like it's almost charged.

340
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,260
你罗嗦了这么多  是不是就为了告诉我
is this your long-winded way of telling me

341
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,570
你关不上它
you just can't turn it off?

342
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,870
联想一下  就像开着水龙头向桶里灌水
think of it like a tap, pouring water into a bucket.

343
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,440
当水桶满了的时候  动力系统就会运行
when the bucket is full, the drive engages,

344
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,240
只是这个特殊的水龙头好像没有阀门
except this particular tap has no valve.

345
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
像是一种严重的设计失误
that seems like a pretty serious design flaw,

346
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,340
你觉得不是吗
don't you think?

347
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,880
没错
exactly.

348
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,550
这让我觉得他们是在干扰它
which leads me to believe they were tampering with it,

349
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,450
不要让它继续徒然的吸取能量了
in a vain attempt to generate more power.

350
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,280
我想他们也从自己不妙的处境看出来了
as they got further and further from their own reality,

351
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,790
他们必须要返航
i guess they figured they'd need it to get back.

352
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,690
然后我们好了
and here we go.

353
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,300
好吧
okay.

354
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,400
我们这是在哪
where are we?

355
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,030
别看我
oh, don't look at me.

356
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,000
我根本没来得及在主系统的控制面板上
i haven't had time to route the main systems

357
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,370
设定路线呢
to these control panels.

358
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,110
我完全是盲目传到这的
i'm flying blind down here.

359
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,410
若楠  泰勒  到舰桥来见我
ronon, teyla, meet me at the bridge.

360
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,310
马上出发
on our way.

361
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,480
继续努力  罗德尼
keep it up, rodney.

362
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,050
中校  亚特兰蒂斯回来了
colonel, atlantis is back.

363
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,650
我正用传感器接收他们
i'm picking them up on the sensors.

364
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,630
你知道这玩意怎么弄
you know how to work this stuff?

365
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,230
上次代达罗斯号还在运行轨道上时
the last time the daedalus was in orbit,

366
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,900
马克斯少校慷慨地
major marks generously offered

367
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,570
给了我们俩一些基础培训
to give both of us some preliminary training.

368
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,830
我那时很忙
i was busy.

369
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,540
亚特兰蒂斯  我是谢帕德  请讲
atlantis, this is sheppard, come in.

370
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,510
亚特兰蒂斯  能听到吗
atlantis, do you read?

371
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,880
亚特兰蒂斯  我是谢帕德  请讲
atlantis, this is sheppard, come in.

372
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,750
可能他们已经有谢帕德了
maybe they already have a sheppard.

373
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,729
罗德尼  我们随机回到自己的世界
rodney, what are the odds of us

374
00:17:07,764 --> 00:17:10,390
的几率会有多大
randomly jumping back into our own reality?

375
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,560
机会微乎其微
i'd say slim to none.

376
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,130
我查到轨道上还有一艘飞船
i'm detecting another ship in orbit.

377
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,430
怎么样的
what kind?

378
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,430
我看看能不能显示到屏幕上
i'll see if i can pull it up on screen.

379
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,340
我认不出来
i don't recognize it.

380
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,910
那是什么
what's that?

381
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,080
你认识吗
you know it?

382
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,080
不
no.

383
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,150
中校  我想
colonel, i believe

384
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,190
这艘船在准备武器
the ship is powering weapons.

385
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,050
我们护盾的情况怎么样
what's our shield status?

386
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,090
最差状态
minimal.

387
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,600
它在攻击亚特兰蒂斯
it's firing on atlantis.

388
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,840
它的护盾能量在消减
the city's shields are failing.

389
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,340
罗德尼  燃料够发动阿斯加德光束吗
rodney, do we have enough juice to power up the asgard beam?

390
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,240
也许
maybe.

391
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,970
你可以打上两枪  怎么了
you might be able to get a couple of shots off. why?

392
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,340
有异族飞船在攻击亚特兰蒂斯
there's some alien ship attacking atlantis.

393
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,480
然后呢
so?

394
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,850
你什么意思  那是亚特兰蒂斯
what do you mean, "so?" it's atlantis!

395
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,680
但那不是我们的亚特兰蒂斯
it's not our atlantis.

396
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,720
我们都不知道那上面有谁
we have no idea who's down there.

397
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,280
我们还是别管闲事
look, we should just stay out of it.

398
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,920
如果我们不帮忙  亚特兰蒂斯就毁了
if we do not intervene, the city will be destroyed.

399
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,220
我们需要帮助
yeah, we need help.

400
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,520
直觉告诉我  我们最好
my gut tells me we're better off

401
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,760
帮那星球上的人一把
going with the people on that planet

402
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,260
管那上面是谁
than whoever's on that ship.

403
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,260
希望你是对的
i hope you're right.

404
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,160
我也希望
yeah, well, me too.

405
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,610
那船受到损坏
the ship's been damaged.

406
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,910
它停止攻击了
it's stopped firing.

407
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,680
希望我们破坏了它的主要武器
hopefully we took out its main weapons.

408
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,080
等等  不对劲
wait, something's happening.

409
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,580
他们派出小飞船了
they're launching fighters.

410
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,530
若楠...
ronon...

411
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,400
你有机会的时候应该要抓紧
you should've took marks up when you had the chance.

412
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,700
你必须现学现卖
now you'll have to learn fast.

413
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,170
电磁轨道炮瞄准系统
rail-gun targeting systems.

414
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,300
按钮在右边
button's on the right.

415
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,640
控制  雷达  跟踪
control, radar, tracking,

416
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,810
然后目标确认
and target acquisition,

417
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,740
按红按钮发射
use the red button to fire.

418
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,390
见鬼  发生了什么
what the hell was that?

419
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,630
我们被攻击了
we're under attack.

420
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,700
能不能把超光速推进器弄好
any chance of getting that hyperdrive back online?

421
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,830
不行  已经完全损坏了
no, it's completely shot!

422
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,470
我告诉过你了
i already told you that!

423
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,770
真是好啊
great.

424
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,010
他们人太多了
there's too many of them.

425
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,780
我坚持不了了
i can't do this.

426
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,040
继续
keep trying!

427
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,430
我们失去了亚光速
we've lost sublight.

428
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,630
船体有裂缝了
we have a hull breach.

429
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,170
空气在流失
we're venting atmosphere.

430
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,170
我不知道该怎么办了
i don't know what to do.

431
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,410
关闭损坏区域
seal off damaged areas.

432
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,180
暂时应该没问题
we should be okay for the moment.

433
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,650
要我就不会那么肯定
i wouldn't be so sure about that.

434
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,720
谢帕德  我有个主意
sheppard, i have an idea!

435
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,250
说来听听
let's hear it.

436
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,490
我建立了新协议
i've set up a few protocols

437
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,290
能提高变换时空推进器
that should increase the efficiency

438
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,390
的工作效率
of the alternate reality drive.

439
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:33,060
如果可以  我们可以马上跃迁到其他时空
if i enable them, we might be able jump sooner.

440
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,800
什么  跃迁到其他时空
what, jump to the next universe?

441
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,460
完全正确
exactly!

442
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,430
但做了就无法回头了
but if i do this, i can't undo it!

443
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,170
我们就会跃迁得越来越快
i mean, we'll just start jumping faster and faster!

444
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,710
就这么做
do it.

445
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,000
成功了
it worked.

446
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,330
我们在哪儿
where are we?

447
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,400
我们有麻烦了
we have a problem.

448
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,440
船体的温度在急速上升
temperature in the hull is rising rapidly.

449
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,340
这是什么鬼东西
what the hell is this?

450
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,450
根据这些数据显示
according to these readings,

451
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,750
我们离太阳外沿
we're less than two million kilometers

452
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,620
不到两百万公里
from the surface of the sun.

453
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,450
我觉得我们总是跃迁到不同时空
i thought we always jumped to the same place

454
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,690
的同一个地方
in every reality.

455
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,920
我也这么想
as did i.

456
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,290
舱体温度到达危险边缘了
hull temperature is approaching critical.

457
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,300
如果不能重新展开护盾
if we do not restore shields...

458
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,660
我们要被烤焦了
we're going to burn.

459
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,350
你确定?
are you sure about this?

460
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,120
这不是我们想象出来的  罗德尼
well, we're not imagining it, rodney.

461
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,320
我把传感器送下去
let me transfer the sensors down to the station.

462
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,260
那至少我能...
then at least i can...

463
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,390
这确实不是你们想象出来的
well, you're definitely not imagining that.

464
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,530
谢谢你的信任
thanks for the vote of confidence.

465
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,100
我不明白
i don't understand it.

466
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,630
我们总到在不同时空的相同地点
we always jump to the same relative position in space.

467
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,170
除非...
unless...

468
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,240
除非什么
unless what?

469
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,840
你说当你在未来时
you said when you went to the future,

470
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,470
看到太阳扩张成红色巨球记得吗
you saw our sun expanding into a red giant, remember?

471
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,110
你是说我们跨越时间了?
what are you saying, we're jumping through time now?

472
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,510
不不不不
no, no, no, no, no,

473
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,480
但也许在我们时空的里终要发生的
but maybe what eventually happens in our reality

474
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,280
就是现在这里已经发生的  只是快很多
is happening in this one, only much sooner.

475
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,920
不是我们到太阳这里
we didn't go to the sun.

476
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,120
是太阳朝着我们来了
the sun came to us.

477
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,220
这对我们有什么帮助
so how does this help us?

478
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,790
我...我不知道
i-i don't know.

479
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,420
我只是觉得很有意思
i just, i found it interesting.

480
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,630
罗德尼  有意思的是
what's interesting, rodney,

481
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,000
想个法子离开这里  免得被烤焦
is a way out of this without getting fried,

482
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,100
比如修好亚光速器
like getting sublight back on,

483
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,070
那我们就能离开这鬼地方了
so we can get the hell out of here.

484
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,440
实际上  我觉得我们最好
actually, i think our best bet

485
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,170
还是尽可能转移能量到护盾上
is just to transfer as much power as we can to the shields,

486
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,340
然后等着下一次跃迁
and ride it out till the next jump.

487
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,440
要多久
when does that happen?

488
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,210
电容的充电时间差别很大
well, the time the capacitor takes to charge is different

489
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,210
因为我定了新协议
now that i've enacted those new protocols.

490
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,780
你知道...
you know, um...

491
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,220
我不知道
i have no idea.

492
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,190
你这根本不是计划  罗德尼
you're not exactly selling the plan, rodney.

493
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,390
我也不知道修好亚光速器
i have no idea how long it would take me

494
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,990
要花多长时间
to fix the sublights either!

495
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,660
我需要进行诊断
look, i've got to run a diagnostic,

496
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,590
理论上  传递能量给护盾
but theoretically, transferring power to the shields

497
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,930
更简单一些
should be relatively easy.

498
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,130
好吧  我们怎么做
all right, what do we do?

499
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,730
首先我要你们到工程舱
the first i need you to do is head down to engineering.

500
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,500
走吧
let's go.

501
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,810
好了  我们到了
all right, we're here.

502
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,920
怎么做
what do we do?

503
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,050
把所有能量都调到
you need to kill all power

504
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,850
"非必要"档
to non-essential decks.

505
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,150
这样就要打开
which means you're going to have to access

506
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,920
主控干预
the main administrative interface.

507
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,560
然后会显示一串
that should bring up a list

508
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,060
可用的多余指令
of all available override commands.

509
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,160
弄好了
got it.

510
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,430
好
okay.

511
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,430
选"生命支持控制"
so choose the command for life support.

512
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,640
你们需要一级一级
you'll have to designate the decks

513
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,170
设定
one by one.

514
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,520
已经全部设定完毕
i think that's all of them.

515
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,690
该死
damn it.

516
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,020
没有提供我预料中足够的能量
that didn't buy us nearly as much power as i would have thought.

517
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,160
一定还有什么疏忽了
well, there's got to be something else.

518
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,460
对...
right, um...

519
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,830
船有辅助能量模块
all right, look, the ship has auxiliary power modules

520
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,360
供应主要系统
for most of the main systems.

521
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,530
很可能能量都耗尽了
most likely they're depleted,

522
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,030
但如果没有
but if not, well,

523
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,300
也许能再给我们点能量
it might buy us a little more juice.

524
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,270
那就这样吧
well, there you go.

525
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,680
那是什么
what the hell was that?

526
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,880
枪战?
was it gunfire?

527
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,220
若楠在哪儿
where's ronon?

528
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,690
你继续
keep working.

529
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,660
集中注意  罗德尼
stay focused, rodney.

530
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,990
告诉我接下去怎么做
tell me what to do next.

531
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,530
好的
all right.

532
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,240
你还好吗
you okay?

533
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,280
嗯
yeah.

534
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,910
他从哪儿冒出来的
where the hell did he come from?

535
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,550
你看
check it out.

536
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:48,190
这是在异族飞船上看到的符号
it's the symbol that was on the alien ship.

537
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,160
他是怎么上来的
how'd he get onboard?

538
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,890
记得吗  他们朝我们撞上来
you know, they crashed into us,

539
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,800
穿过我们的船体
penetrated our hull, remember?

540
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,330
这么说他是故意的?
think he did it on purpose?

541
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,970
问得好
that's a good question.

542
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,210
我来试试
let me try that--

543
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,980
好了
that's it.

544
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,550
差不多都设置完毕了
that's all of them.

545
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,850
我得去帮谢帕德中校和若楠了
i must go help colonel sheppard and ronon.

546
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,420
罗德尼  你自己小心了
good luck, rodney.

547
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,890
不  不  不  不够哇
no, no, no, no, no, it's not enough!

548
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,120
什么意思
what do you mean?

549
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,090
没有亚光速  我们的在轨道在向太阳收缩
without sublights, our orbit is decaying,

550
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,660
这就意味这更多的辐射会冲进我们的护盾
which means more radiation slamming into the shields.

551
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,430
变换时空的推进器也才充了70%左右
the alternate reality drive is only charged to 70% percent.

552
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,770
等不到充完  我们的护盾就先崩溃了
which means it'll never make 100 before the shields fail.

553
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,800
那我们该怎么办
well, what do we do?

554
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,170
我们没有能源了
we have no more power.

555
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,510
让我想想
j-just... give me a second.

556
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,720
罗德尼  谢帕德和若楠现在受到攻击了
rodney, colonel sheppard and ronon are under attack.

557
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,190
我知道了  我知道了
all right, i got it, i got it.

558
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,390
关闭护盾
drop the shields.

559
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,030
什么
what?

560
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,260
关闭护盾
drop the shields,

561
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,360
我会尽量把所有的能源都传输到推进器
i will transfer all available power to the drive.

562
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,160
希望足够我们进行下一次跃迁
hopefully it'll be enough to induce a jump.

563
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,260
希望?
hopefully?

564
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,530
这是我们唯一的办法了
it is our only option,

565
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,900
我们越争论一分
and every second we argue about it,

566
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,530
成功的机会就少一分
is less of a chance it's going to work!

567
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,770
好吧
very well.

568
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,770
关闭护盾
dropping shields.

569
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,040
船体温度超过安全指数了
hull temperature is passing critical.

570
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:19,710
现在  把能源都转到推进器上
okay, transferring power to the drive now.

571
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,120
不  不  不
oh, no, no, no, no, no.

572
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,290
怎么了
what is it?

573
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,920
还是不够啊  只有98%
it's not enough. it's only 98%!

574
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,830
罗德尼  船体开始损毁了
rodney, the hull is beginning to deteriorate.

575
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,770
加把劲啊  加把劲
come on, come on!

576
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,270
就现在  谢帕德  我们要跃迁了
that's it! sheppard, we're jumping!

577
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,360
干得好  罗德尼
nice work, rodney.

578
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,790
你不会想这么早夸我的
uh, you may want to hold off on the congratulations.

579
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,530
又怎么了
now what?

580
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,630
我好像使推进器超负荷了
i think i've overtaxed the drive.

581
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,100
虽然还没有爆炸
look, it's not completely blown, but

582
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,430
我们还有几次跃迁  但它已经快撑不住了
we've only a handful of jumps before it's burned out.

583
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,070
好吧  然后会怎样
all right, then what happens?

584
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,770
如果到那时候  我们还不知道如何返回的话
if we haven't found our way back by then,

585
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,710
我们就再也回不去了
we will be stranded forever.

586
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,640
这星球怎么了
what happened to the planet?

587
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,070
罗德尼认为  在这一时空里
rodney believes that in this reality,

588
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:33,470
它被一股或许是几百万年前的冲击力破坏了
it was destroyed by an impact,possibly millions of years ago.

589
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,640
留下了这一片星场
all that remains is this asteroid field.

590
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,440
来  我有些新发现了
all right, i think i got something.

591
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,310
其实就一直都在那
in fact, it was staring me in the face the whole time.

592
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,220
是我之前专注于躲避危险而没有注意到
i was just too busy trying to avoid imminent death to notice it.

593
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,850
你说的是什么
what are you talking about?

594
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,290
是我的错  老是盯着导航系统不放
see, my mistake was focusing on the navigation system.

595
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,290
我早该知道的  这法子没用
i should've known that was never going to work.

596
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,590
然后呢
so, what, then?

597
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,420
多谢多维数学的奇妙特性
so in spectacular feat of multi-dimensional mathematics,

598
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,490
我找到个办法  使我们的飞船
i've discovered a way to send the ship back

599
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,860
既能够原路返回
along the path it's previously traveled

600
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,760
又能够绕开导航系统
bypassing the navigation system altogether.

601
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,100
等一下
wait a minute.

602
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,230
你的意思是把这东西反向运行?
you're talking about putting this thing in reverse?

603
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,770
完全正确
exactly.

604
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,940
我2个小时前就这么说过了
i just suggested that two hours ago.

605
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,820
我之前是根本没想过嘛
and naturally,i dismissed it out of hand,

606
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,210
接着我又意识到  包括最初的设计者
but then i realized that, including the original designer,

607
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,210
不是一个  已经是有两个版本的我
not one, but two versions of myself

608
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,340
都没办法搞定这东西了
have failed to make this thing work.

609
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,110
我不能按我的模式来思考
i had to think not like me.

610
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,580
必须要跳出我的模式思考
i had to think the opposite of me.

611
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,950
当局者迷  旁观者清
doesn't get more opposite than you.

612
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,720
我把它理解成夸奖我了
i'll take that as a compliment.

613
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,050
那我们是回得去还是回不去
so can we get back or not?

614
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,250
不完全是
well, not directly.

615
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,820
要计算出
it's impossible to calculate

616
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,890
我们的起点和现在位置的相对方位
the relative position of our original starting point

617
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:25,760
是有点不太可能的
from where we are now,

618
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,390
但是可以追踪我们之前的脚步
but we can retrace our steps,

619
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,930
把每一个时空轮流转一遍
passing through each reality in turn

620
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,730
直到找到正确的那个
until we reach the right one.

621
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,130
有点小问题  罗德尼
slight problem, rodney.

622
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,570
我们不太可能活着离开这些时空的
we barely got out of those realities alive.

623
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,140
如果我们不修复护盾
if we do no restore the shields,

624
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,510
太阳的辐射就会置我们于死地
the radiation from the red giant will kill us.

625
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,710
那倒不一定
not necessarily.

626
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,070
我们知道
we let the ship carry us

627
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,440
飞船能够用它的动量载我们
in its momentum in real space

628
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,840
从这个时空到下一个
from one reality to the next.

629
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,280
我们现在亚光速引擎也许不能用了
now, we may not have sublight engines,

630
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,880
但我们至少还有起飞加速器
but we do have maneuvering thrusters.

631
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,250
只要沿着正确的轨道
you know, one long continuous burn

632
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,250
从现在起直到下一个跃迁
along the right trajectory,

633
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,550
引擎长时间持续运转
from now until the next jump

634
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,420
应该还是足够我们
should be enough to allow us to establish a higher,

635
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,360
在太阳附近建立一个更稳定的轨道
more stable orbit around the sun.

636
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,720
从而就能不受辐射影响?
so the radiation will not affect us?

637
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,060
我没想那么多
well, i wouldn't go that far,

638
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,430
但至少可以...避免不死吧?
but still, it'll be... not quite as deadly?

639
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,030
好了
okay.

640
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,430
就是这样
that's it.

641
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,030
我们就这样子办好了
course is already plotted.

642
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,500
那这些异族家伙呢
what about those alien dudes?

643
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,900
他知道是我们朝他们开枪的
they're know we're the ones that shot at them.

644
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,670
说不定他们到时候就走了
maybe they'll be gone.

645
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,000
顾不上他们了
i wouldn't count on it.

646
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,210
在每个时空
time is passing at the same rate

647
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,670
时间的流逝还是按照相同比率的
in each of the realities, which means...

648
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,640
这就说明了...不会那么久啦
it hasn't been that long.

649
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,939
要搞定那些异族的
to get past those aliens,

650
00:30:17,974 --> 00:30:19,450
我们还是需要有亚光速引擎
we're going to need sublight engines,

651
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,610
我得去尽快修好它
and i'm going to need to fix them in time.

652
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,850
等一下  你不是说都不知道是什么毛病吗
wait, wait, but you said you don't know what's wrong with those.

653
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,890
我是还没机会去看过啊
i haven't had a chance to check it out.

654
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,890
很遗憾  我又没有三头六臂
i'm sorry i can't do 10 things at once.

655
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,460
我都说了
i already told you,

656
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,720
推进器马上就撑不住了的
the drive is going to burn out,soon.

657
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,160
我们总得采取点行动吧
we have to do something.

658
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,960
说不定下个时空会更糟
who's to say the next reality won't be even worse?

659
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,240
好了
all right,

660
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,810
推进器的所有设置更改完毕
all the modifications to the drive are in place.

661
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,740
开始!
here we go.

662
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,730
成功了
it worked.

663
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,560
你办到了  罗德尼
you did it, rodney.

664
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,030
那好吧
all right,

665
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,260
我现在过去引擎那边了
i'm going to head up to engineering,

666
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,270
去检查下亚光速器
get to work on the sublights.

667
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,870
现在情况怎样
what's our status?

668
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,670
机身温度上升
hull temperature is rising,

669
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,140
但不如以前那么快
but not as rapidly as it did before.

670
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,270
我想应该没问题
i think we'll be okay.

671
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,940
已经都烤了这么长时间了
so much for the frying pan.

672
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,080
但愿能够经得起高温
let's hope we make it through the fire.

673
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,750
进展如何
how is it coming?

674
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,420
不太好
ah, it's not good.

675
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,020
主要系统的温度都太高了
the main systems are completely fried.

676
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,720
我得架个辅助通道
i'll have to do a full bypass.

677
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,960
我能帮忙么
can i be of assistance?

678
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,190
可能不行
i doubt it.

679
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,460
噢  该死的
oh, jeez!

680
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,800
搞什么
what the...

681
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,910
多谢
thanks.

682
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,080
或许可以单独诊断一下辅助系统
perhaps a separate diagnostic of the auxiliary system might be useful.

683
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,450
我试试
uh, sure.

684
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,390
谢谢你  罗德尼
i wanted to thank you, rodney.

685
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,820
为什么
for what?

686
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,160
因为你不放弃
for not giving up.

687
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,190
噢  我知道是怎么回事了
oh, i know what this is.

688
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,830
这是你回来后的第一个任务
it's your first mission back.

689
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,500
放心  我不会让它变成你的最后一个
look, i am not about to let it be your last, okay?

690
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,200
不  这正是我所担心的
oh, no, that's what i was afraid of.

691
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,800
那是什么
what is it?

692
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,970
推进器能量充得快了许多
the drive's charging a lot faster now.

693
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,240
谢帕德
sheppard...

694
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,440
看来马上要开始下一次跃迁
looks like the next jump's going to happen

695
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,710
比我们料想得快多了
a lot sooner than we thought.

696
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,410
亚光速引擎怎样了
how's it coming with the sublight engine?

697
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,220
还要几分钟
i'm going to need a few minutes.

698
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,650
我们还能有几分钟吗
do we have a few more minutes?

699
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,480
我很怀疑
i doubt it.

700
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,020
电磁轨道炮又派上用场了
all right, let's split rail gun positions.

701
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,820
我在前  你断后
i'll take forward, you take aft.

702
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,420
你觉得这样有用么
you really think that'll make a difference?

703
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,490
没有护盾  也许没什么用
without shields, probably not,

704
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:48,760
但我们没得选了
but we don't have much of a choice.

705
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,640
异族的飞船在哪
where's the alien ship?

706
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,810
不太清楚
i'm not sure.

707
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:04,510
也许他们离开了
well, maybe they left.

708
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,080
没这么好运  他们就在我们后边
no such luck. they're right behind us.

709
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,590
战斗机正在朝我们的位置驶来
fighters, closing in on our position.

710
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,930
你那里进展怎么样了
how's it going down there?

711
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,830
再给我点儿时间
look, just give me a second!

712
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,870
罗德尼
rodney...

713
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,670
好了  现在试一试
okay, try it now.

714
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,780
好了  我搞定了
that's it, i've got it!

715
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,810
启动  启动  启动
go, go, go, go, go, go!

716
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,430
谢帕德
sheppard...

717
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,230
我们现在情况如何
how we doing?

718
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,970
他们紧咬着我们不放
they're gaining on us.

719
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,740
我们能再快点儿吗
can you get us more speed?

720
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,200
根本没有可能
there's not a chance!

721
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,700
我好不容易才让这鬼东西工作
look, i've barely got this thing working as it is!

722
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,070
如果我们继续加大功率
if we tax it any more,

723
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,370
整个系统会崩溃的
we're going to blow the whole system!

724
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,040
这样的话我们麻烦大了
then we've got a real problem.

725
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,680
他们进入攻击射程
they're in weapons range.

726
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,150
反击
return fire.

727
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,680
我正努力去做
i'm trying.

728
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:42,330
冷静点儿伙计  这些按钮与你无仇
easy, chewie, those buttons are your friends.

729
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,230
继续努力
just keep trying.

730
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,330
我很努力了
i'm trying!

731
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,970
这下好了  亚光速器这次彻底坏掉了
that's it, sublights are gone for good this time!

732
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,800
那是什么鬼东西
what the hell was that?

733
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,900
f-302s
f-302s.

734
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,600
是亚特兰蒂斯
it's atlantis.

735
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,190
发生了什么
what's happening?

736
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,190
我们得到火力援助了
looks like we're getting some help from some friends.

737
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:43,560
看来我们选对了盟友
guess we bet on the right side after all.

738
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,990
代达罗斯号  这是中校约翰·谢帕德
daedalus , this is lt. colonel john sheppard.

739
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,900
收到请讲
do you read?

740
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,170
代达罗斯号  收到请讲
daedalus, do you read?

741
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,570
收到  这里是代达罗斯号
yeah,  daedalus. uh, this is  daedalus .

742
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,040
请讲
come in.

743
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,040
谁  这是谁
who... who is this?

744
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,440
说来话长
it's a long story.

745
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,110
不管你是谁  当你摧毁他们主武器的时候
well, whoever you are, you saved our asses

746
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,210
救了我们一把
when you took out their main weapons.

747
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,850
我想至少我们可以礼尚往来
figured the least we could do is return the favor.

748
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,920
笑纳了
much appreciated.

749
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,020
谢帕德
uh, sheppard...

750
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,700
该死
oh, crap.

751
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,010
刚才的很抱歉
sorry about that.

752
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,270
有一个逃脱了
one of 'em got through.

753
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,540
不过射击的挺漂亮的
nice shooting, though.

754
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,550
谢谢
oh, thanks.

755
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,900
好了  看起来这是他们最后一个了
all right, looks like that's the last of them.

756
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,970
现在怎么办
so, uh... so, what happens now?

757
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,840
我们走我们自己的
well, we go our own ways.

758
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,470
就这样?
just like that?

759
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,210
就这样
pretty much.

760
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,440
问题是
well, the thing is, uh,

761
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,080
我们有些困惑
we do have a few questions.

762
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,480
我们所熟知的代达罗斯号两年前与复制人的战斗中
see, the  daedalus we know was destroyed two years ago

763
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,520
已经被摧毁了
in a battle with the replicators.

764
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,690
很遗憾听到这个消息
sorry to hear that,

765
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,990
但是这并不是完全意义上的代达罗斯号
but this isn't exactly our  daedalus .

766
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,560
我们只是暂时借用一下
we're just borrowing it for a while.

767
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,530
好吧  我现在完全云里雾里
okay, i have no idea what that means.

768
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:29,270
如我所讲  这故事说来话长
like i said, it's a long story.

769
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:32,100
好吧  代达罗斯号  祝你好运
all right,  daedalus , good luck.

770
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,240
谢谢
thank you, colonel,

771
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,640
最后一件事情
and one last thing,

772
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,470
遇到你很愉快
it's been a pleasure.

773
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,210
很显然  你有一身正气
you're obviously a man of great integrity,

774
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,110
而且是一名负责的指挥官
and a dedicated commander,

775
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:45,420
并且是一名优秀的飞行员
and a very skilled pilot.

776
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,820
很有意思
well, that's funny.

777
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,050
我也想这样评价你
i was going to say the same to you.

778
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,700
好的
all right.

779
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,070
异族飞船离开了
the alien ship's gone.

780
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,670
我读取到了一个没有能源显示的星球
i'm reading a planet with no energy signatures.

781
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,200
这是我们跃迁到达的第一个时空
it's the first reality we jumped to.

782
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,370
再来一个  我们就可以回家了
one more, and we're home.

783
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:11,170
我们现在去停泊舱
let's get down to the hangar bay.

784
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,590
好的
all right...

785
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,830
我中枪了
i got shot!

786
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,000
我以为他们都被干掉了
i thought we got 'em all.

787
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,370
显然没有处理干净
apparently not.

788
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,610
你认为附近还有他们的人吗
think there's any more of them?

789
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,180
我们没空去搜寻了
we're not waiting around to find out.

790
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,550
快跑  快跑  快跑
move, move, move!

791
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,170
爆炸造成了船体裂缝
the explosion's caused a hull breech.

792
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,670
所有区域压强下降
whole sections have been de-pressurized,

793
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,240
包括停泊舱
including the hangar bay!

794
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,370
我们的飞船没了!
we just lost the jumpers!

795
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,440
罗德尼  我们该去往下一站了
our stop is coming up, rodney.

796
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,710
是时候弃舰了
it's time to get off this train.

797
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,210
但是根本没有出口哇
look, there's no way off.

798
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,850
一旦我们跃迁进入自己的时空
once we jump into our own reality,

799
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,950
亚特兰蒂斯会探测到我们的
atlantis will detect us,

800
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,450
然后我们可以发出求救信号
and they will send help.

801
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,520
为了躲避战斗机  我们偏离了预定轨道
we broke orbit to get away from the fighters, remember?

802
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,890
我们按照自己的路径
look, we carry our momentum

803
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,920
还有空间中的相对坐标
and relative position in space

804
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,160
从一个空间穿梭到另一个
from one reality to the next.

805
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,690
也就是说  下一次跃迁
which means, by the time we next jump,

806
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,730
我们可能会偏离预定位置几百万公里
we're going to be, like, half a million kilometers out.

807
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,830
他们根本无法及时找到我们
they're never going to get to us in time!

808
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,560
我们有C-4炸药
we got c-4.

809
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,870
我们等待机会回去  然后炸掉推进器
we wait till we get back, then we blow the drive.

810
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,200
也许可行
that could work,

811
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,440
但也只能在时空连续空间内炸个小洞
or it could tear a hole in the space-time continuum

812
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,740
不但害死我们自己
not only killing us

813
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,270
甚至摧毁整个太阳系
but destroying the entire solar system!

814
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:51,370
我们最好快点儿想个法子
well, we'd better think of something fast.

815
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,890
屏幕上再次出现了呼救信号
another contact just appeared on our screens.

816
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,520
是不是代达罗斯号发出的?
was it the  daedalus ?

817
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,290
不可能  距离太远根本无法通信
no, they're too far out for us to get i.f.f.

818
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,690
那么试一试亚空间通信
well, try subspace.

819
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,130
谢帕德中校  收到请回答
colonel sheppard, do you read?

820
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,660
谢帕德中校  我是罗恩少校
colonel sheppard, this is major lorne,

821
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,530
收到请讲
do you read?

822
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,030
他们是不是超空间飞行了
was there a hyperspace window?

823
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,170
长官  没有
no, sir.

824
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,540
他们只是突然间冒出来了
they just appeared out of nowhere.

825
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,840
那么  一定是他们
well, it's got to be them.

826
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,710
叫伍尔希先生注意  博士你跟我来
alert mr. woolsey. doc, you're with me.

827
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,680
我们走  快点儿
let's go, come on.

828
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,720
好了  我们现在应该在呼叫范围内了
all right, we should be within radio range.

829
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,350
谢帕德中校  请讲
colonel sheppard, come in.

830
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,060
麦凯博士  我是罗恩少校
dr. mckay, this is major lorne.

831
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,220
收到请讲
do you read?

832
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,360
干扰太大了
there's too much interference.

833
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:46,060
我截获了某种能量信号
i'm picking up some kind of energy reading.

834
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,730
成尖峰状
it's spiking.

835
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:57,810
到底发生了什么
what the hell just happened?

836
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,710
他们突然消失了
they disappeared.

837
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,680
你在说什么
what are you talking about?

838
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,180
他们就这样消失了
well... they're just gone.

839
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,850
等一下
oh, wait a minute.

840
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,520
我截取到4个生命迹象
i'm picking up four lifesigns.

841
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,220
好的  哪里
okay, where?

842
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,860
就在前边
dead ahead.

843
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,670
谢帕德中校  是你吗
colonel sheppard, is that you?

844
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,670
少校
major...

845
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,370
很高兴你找到我们
nice of you to stop by.

846
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,440
这附近连个鬼影就见不到
kind of hard to get a cab in this neighborhood.

847
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,210
长官  收到
yes, sir.

848
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,190
推进器损坏以前
how many jumps

849
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,460
还可以进行几次时空跃迁
you think that drive has left in it before it burns out?

850
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,860
最多六次
half a dozen, tops.

851
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,660
6次后就失效了
then it'll be completely inert.

852
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,760
好的
good.

853
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,930
我可不希望有人跟我们一样
i'd hate to think of somebody else

854
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,660
困在那个鬼地方
getting trapped inside that thing like we did.

855
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,300
事实上  我一直在想  没错
actually, you know,i've been thinking about that. now, true,

856
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,400
导航系统因为故障无法启动
the navigation system was flawed to start,

857
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,570
但是推进器的基本原理
but the basic principles of the drive

858
00:41:58,570 --> 00:41:59,600
是合乎常理的
are fundamentally sound--

859
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,770
行了  罗德尼
forget it, rodney.

860
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,040
我保留了相关的数据
i've saved the relevant data.

861
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,110
局部改进一下  我就可以
minor adjustments, and i should be able to

862
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,170
让这东西开始工作了
have this thing up and running--

863
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,080
我说了别倒腾这东西了
i said forget it.

864
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,110
看看谁来了
hey, look who's here.

865
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,550
罗德尼  你的肩膀怎么样了
how's your shoulder, rodney?

866
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,750
伤的挺重
uh, it's pretty bad,

867
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,380
但是现在好了些  谢谢了
but, you know, better, thanks.

868
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,720
有劲儿抱抱他吗
is it well enough to hold him?

869
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,490
说真的吗
really?

870
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,900
别把他摔了
don't drop him.

871
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,760
谢谢
thank you.

872
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,340
瞧瞧  小家伙
hey there, little guy.

873
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,670
我想他喜欢我
i think he likes me.

874
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,840
看起来很配
it suits you.

875
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,240
你也这么认为
you think so?

876
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,210
我想有一天你会成为一个伟大的父亲
i think you'll make an excellent father someday.

877
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,020
我一生中目睹了无数可怕的事情
i've seen a lot of scary things in my time,

878
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:52,160
但是这个尤为吓人
but that thought scares me the most.

879
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,020
你想...
do you want to, um...

880
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,530
我想是的
i think so.

881
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:57,860
给你  小心点儿
there you go, watch out...

882
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,200
好的
right.
