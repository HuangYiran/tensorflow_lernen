我的名字叫奧利弗·奎恩
My name is Oliver Queen.

5
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,450
五年里  我被困在地獄一般的小島上
After five years on a hellish island,

6
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,550
我回來只有一個目標
I have come home with only one goal--

7
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,830
拯救我的城市
to save my city.

8
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,830
但要達到目標  我不能像過去一樣成為兇手
But to do so, I can't be the killer I once was.

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,450
為了紀念我的朋友
To honor my friend's memory,

10
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,400
我只能偽裝成另一個人

11
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,870
{\an8}深切懷念托馬斯·梅林
孝子

12
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,210
成為另一個存在

13
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,340
《綠箭》前情回顧
Previously on "Arrow"...

14
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,990
這個人對我們沒用了
This one's no longer of use to us.

15
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,540
等一下  他或許還有用
Wait. He could still be useful.

16
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,100
她說得對  一旦我們殺了他的朋友
She's right. Once we get rid of his friends,

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,860
我們就得需要他帶我們去墓地了
we'll need him to lead us to the grave.

18
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,610
你要再回到島上

19
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,660
你已經失去你的父親了

你母親還在
Your mom, she's still here.

21
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,390
她一定很想見見你
And I'm sure she'd love to see you.

22
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,340
我不會去監獄看她
I'm not going to that prison.

23
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,500
我只知道這樣才能讓她痛苦
It's the only way I know how to hurt her.

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,220
我很想恨你
And I want to hate you.

25
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,430
但是我恨不起來
But I can't.

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,140
我一直以為我們之間沒有秘密
I didn't think that there were secrets kept between us.

27
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,690
媽媽  你在隱瞞什么

30
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,480
{\an8}半年前

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,430
上帝  請原諒我  我辜負了這座城市
And, god forgive me, I have failed this city.

32
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,710
我被迫參與了一項事業
I have been complicit in an undertaking

33
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,780
它有一個恐怖的目的

34
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,640
摧毀貧民區以及里面每一個人

如果你住在貧民區
If you reside in the glades,

36
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,360
{\an8}貧民區遭到攻擊

37
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,970
請立刻離開

你和你的孩子們  命懸一線

典獄長說我們得撤退了

幫我拿走這些
Help me get these out of here.

42
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,390
-那囚犯呢  -不管他們

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
-來  放我出去  -不

你太野心勃勃
Too...ambitious.

47
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,310
你
You.

我喜歡你的工作

很有前途
Big future.

50
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,650
小心點
Hey, be careful.

51
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,010
可能會有余震
There's liable to be aftershocks.

52
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
我巴不得呢

53
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,300
綠箭  第二季第七集

54
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,890
{\an8}現在

55
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,430
奎恩先生  您母親勝訴的幾率有多大
Mr. Queen, what are your mother's chances?

56
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,270
是不是有人監視以防她自殺
Is she on suicide watch?

57
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,810
奎恩先生  能發表評論嗎
Mr. Queen, can you give us any comment?

58
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,000
這不公平  又不是他們進行庭審
It's not fair. They're not the ones on trial.

59
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,220
那也不能阻止簡·洛林
That won't stop Jean Loring

60
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,670
用他們來獲取公眾的同情
from using them as props to drum up sympathy.

61
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,130
你看起來不大擔心
You don't seem overly concerned.

62
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,920
她在直播電視里承認自己是共犯
She confessed to being an accomplice on live television.

63
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,420
她也說了是馬爾科姆·梅林強迫的她
She also sad that Malcolm Merlyn coerced her.

64
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,320
你有什么證據  對吧
You have something, don't you?

65
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,180
我是你的合伙律師  亞當
I thought I was your co-counsel, Adam.

66
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,690
如果你手里有王牌
If you're holding a trump card,

67
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,590
難道不該和我分享一下嗎
don't you think maybe you should share it with me?

68
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,220
這場庭審會很棒的
It's going to be a good trial.

69
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,220
我們進去吧
Come on, let's get inside.

70
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,650
你沒必要這樣做
You don't have to do this.

71
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,770
艾沃說有必要
Ivo says we do.

72
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,310
你的朋友們對他的人來說是個威脅
Your friends are a danger to his men.

73
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,880
快去  別驚動他們
Go. Quick and quiet.

74
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,130
斯萊德  莎朵  快跑
Slade! Shado! Run!

75
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,490
里面沒人
There's no one here.

76
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,680
他們肯定轉移了
They must have moved on from their position.

77
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,080
炸藥放好了  這是引爆器
Chargers are placed. Here's the detonator.

78
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,610
確保他們無"家"可歸
Make sure they have no place to return to.

79
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,710
去吧
Go.

80
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,050
你
And you.

81
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,330
現在你要帶我們去墓地
Now you're going to take us to the graves.

82
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,340
走吧  拉他起來
Let's go. Get him up.

83
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,530
動身
Let's get clear.

84
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,550
你找到引爆器了嗎
Did you find the detonator?

85
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,380
找到了
Yes.

86
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,990
我們真走運
We were lucky.

87
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,250
是我走運  你很厲害
I was lucky. You were good.

88
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,080
不管怎樣
Either way...

89
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,090
奧利弗都在他們手上
they have Oliver.

90
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,050
我去找他
I'm going after him.

91
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,960
我陪你去
Not alone.

92
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,730
你都沒法走路
You can barely walk.

93
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,100
所以我更不能待在這里
All the more reason not to stay here.

94
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,710
不能再給他們一次把我炸飛的機會
Give them another chance at blowing me up.

95
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,930
你倆沒事吧
Are you two ok?

96
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,140
我該問你這個問題
I should be asking you that question.

97
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,180
我沒事
I'll be fine.

98
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,720
你看上去像得了流感
You look like you have the flu.

99
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,790
如果真是那樣  我不該
If that's true, I shouldn't

100
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,460
浪費時間接種疫苗的
have wasted my time getting vaccinated.

101
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,920
狄格爾  不管是怎么回事  回家去吧
Diggle, whatever it is, just go home.

102
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,300
奧利弗  我能處理好的  好嗎
Oliver, listen, I can take care of things. All right?

103
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,200
不  我們沒事的
No, we'll be fine, all right?

104
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
去休息吧  別逼我叫警察
Go rest. And don't make me call a cop.

105
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,900
這里就有幾個
There are a few of them around here.

106
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,800
我被迫參與了一項事業
I have been complicit in an undertaking

107
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,010
它有一個恐怖的目的
with one horrible purpose--

108
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,370
摧毀貧民區以及里面每一個人
to destroy the glades and everyone in it.

109
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,360
奏效了  貧民區被毀
And it worked. The Glades were destroyed.

110
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,350
哀橫遍野  人們流離失所
Homes and lives were lost.

111
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,530
都是因為她的行為
All because of her actions.

112
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,460
確實  她想清楚之后做了悔改
True, she had second thoughts;

113
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,100
自責促使她發表這份聲明
remorse which compelled her to deliver this statement.

114
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,580
但我想替那天逝去的503條生命
But on behalf of the 503 lives

115
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,180
在這里說一句話
that were extinguished that day,

116
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,740
莫伊拉·奎恩  你的自責太遲了
I say, Moira Queen, your remorse comes too late.

117
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,110
在過去的五年里
For the last five years,

118
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,180
我和我家人的生命
under the threat for my life

119
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,090
受到了威脅
and the lives of my family...

120
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,260
為什么這些威脅沒有讓她沉默
Why wouldn't those threats silence her?

121
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,430
為什么莫伊拉·奎恩沒有被嚇倒
Why wouldn't Moira Queen be terrified?

122
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,230
馬爾科姆·梅林殺了她的第一任丈夫
Malcolm Merlyn killed her first husband,

123
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,550
綁架了她的第二任丈夫
abducted her second.

124
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,610
她為什么不擔心自己的性命
Why wouldn't she be in fear for her life?

125
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,690
不擔心自己兒女的性命
For the lives of her children?

126
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,970
你們會怎么做
What would you do?

127
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,560
如果你們的子女
If it were your children in the crosshairs

128
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,250
被一個瘋子控制
of a mad man's rage?

129
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,690
星級實驗室的粒子加速器
They say the Star lab's particle accelerator

130
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,050
會如期開啟
will be turned on right on schedule.

131
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,900
其他新聞  我們剛剛收到消息
In other news, we have just received word

132
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,730
莫伊拉·奎恩庭審中的正反兩方
that both sides have now completed their opening statements

133
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,540
都已經完成了開庭陳詞
in the Moira Queen trial.

134
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,770
別理解錯了  但你看起來很惡心
Don't take this the wrong way, but you look disgusting.

135
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,670
好吧  我感覺不太好  費利西蒂
Yeah, well, I don't feel great, Felicity.

136
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,360
你有沒有解決的辦法
Is there a right way to take that?

137
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,010
你應該回家
You should go home.

138
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,650
我正要回去
I am going.

139
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,980
我只是得安排一個替補保鏢
I just need to make arrangements for a replacement bodyguard.

140
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,430
你打流感疫苗了嗎  我從沒打過
Did you get the flu shot? Personally, I never do.

141
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,260
我知道我應該打
I know that I should.

142
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,870
可我  我對針頭很恐懼
I just, I have this thing about needles.

143
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,240
對尖的東西都恐懼
All pointy things, really.

144
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,530
這很諷刺  想想我們跟誰共事
Which is ironic, considering who we work with.

145
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,750
對  不是流感  費利西蒂  更像是
Yeah, it's not the flu, Felicity, it's more like...

146
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,590
狄格
Dig!

147
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,590
有人嗎
Hello?

148
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,430
你在這里嗎
Are you here?

149
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,250
在這里  在那里
Here...there...

150
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,010
在任何地方
Everywhere.

151
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,130
那么
So.

152
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,950
我們的科學項目進展如何
How goes our little science project?

153
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,600
如你所料
Working like you said it would.

154
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,940
多美妙啊
How wonderful.

155
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,500
是這樣
Ah, so listen.

156
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,670
干這事要五萬塊
Doing the thing was 50,000.

157
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,940
保守這個秘密
Keeping quiet about it,

158
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,010
我覺得應該再加五萬
I'm thinking it should be 50 more.

159
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,100
不過我想讓流言傳開
Oh, I want word to spread.

160
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,780
這正是整體目標的一部分
It's kind of the whole objective, actually.

161
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,400
你懂我意思嗎
You see my point?

162
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,430
你應該知道  我覺得事后談判
You should know, I find post hoc negotiation...

163
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,900
很令人討厭
distasteful.

164
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,290
真可惜你看不到你的工作
Such a shame you won't get to see

165
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,260
會得到怎樣的成果  博士
what your works have wrought, doctor.

166
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,530
但很快  所有人都能看到
But soon, everyone else will.

167
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,870
而且他們會祈求它快點結束
And they'll beg for it to end.

168
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,200
你來這里干什么
What the hell are you doing here?

169
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,180
我聽說你昏過去了
I heard you passed out.

170
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,420
我讓費利西蒂別打電話給你
I told Felicity not to call you.

171
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,400
對  但在那之前  你喊了一聲就倒下了
Yeah, but before that, you said "Gaw" And "Thud,"

172
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,730
所以我沒把你的話當回事
so I didn't take it very seriously.

173
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,290
她打給我是對的  狄格爾  你需要就醫
She was right to call me. Diggle, you need medical attention.

174
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,150
他不止需要就醫  狄格昏過去時
He needs more than that. When Dig passed out,

175
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,500
我把他的血樣給了公司里的一個化學家
I sent a sample of his blood to a chemist I know at QC.

176
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,890
他欠我人情  說來話長
The guy owes me a favor. Long story,

177
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,170
我幫他取消過停車罰單
I fixed his parking ticket.

178
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,050
其實也不是很長
Huh. I guess it's not that long.

179
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,160
費利西蒂  血樣
Felicity. The blood sample.

180
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,680
對  迷魂檢測的結果  顯示陽性
Yeah. It came back positive-- for trace amounts of Vertigo.

181
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,060
我從沒用過迷魂
I never used Vertigo before in my life.

182
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,710
你肯定是接觸到了
You were exposed to it somehow.

183
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,100
迷魂又出現了嗎
Vertigo's in play again?

184
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,390
伯爵迷魂吸入過量治好后
When the Count recovered from his OD on Vertigo,

185
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,810
他被送到了鐵山監獄
he was sent to Iron Heights.

186
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,840
監獄在地震中被毀
That got hit in the quake.

187
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,790
他和娃娃制造者是同一種方式出來的
He got out the same way the Doll Maker did?

188
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,160
而且和娃娃制造者一樣
And just like with the Doll Maker,

189
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,610
警方加班加點地工作來掩蓋他的逃逸
prison officials worked overtime to keep the lid on the escape.

190
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,940
-我知道你在想什么  -不  你不知道
- I know what you're thinking. - No, you don't.

191
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,180
我當時選擇不殺這個人
I made ahoice not to put an arrow in this guy.

192
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,910
而這么做是對的
And it was the right choice.

193
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,260
不會再有殺戮
There's no more killing.

194
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,710
我做了這個來祛除迷魂的藥效
I worked this up to counteract the effects of Vertigo.

195
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,240
給狄格爾注射  我...
Give it to Diggle. I...

196
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,150
我得回法庭去
I need to get back to court.

197
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,890
我不在的時候  盡一切努力
While I'm gone, just work up whatever you can

198
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,010
查清楚狄格爾是如何
and figure out how Diggle got

199
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,600
在不知情的情況下攝入迷魂的
Vertigo in his system without his knowledge.

200
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,830
好  去吧
Ok. Go.

201
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,550
你第一次聽說
When was the first time

202
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,240
那項事業是什么時候
you head about this so-called Undertaking?

203
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,240
跟別人一樣  在我媽開記者招待會的時候
When everyone else did, when my mother gave the press conference.

204
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,880
你好像不是很能接受
Doesn't seem like you took it too well.

205
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,180
我很吃驚
I was surprised.

206
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,150
誰不會吃驚呢
Who wouldn't be?

207
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,760
你母親當時  立刻就被收監了
Uh, your mother was, um, immediately take into custody,

208
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,370
不過你似乎去看守所里看過她
but I assume you went down to the precinct to see her?

209
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,690
其實在她搬走之前我都沒見過她
Um, actually I didn't see her until she was moved.

210
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,610
搬到監獄之前
To the prison.

211
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,970
你還記得你是什么時候去看她的嗎
Do you remember when you visited her?

212
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,950
不記得確切日期了
Uh, not the exact date.

213
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,230
沒關系  我有訪客記錄
It's ok, I have the visitor log here.

214
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,200
十月九日
October ninth.

215
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,600
也就是五個月之后
Five months later.

216
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,560
怎么這么久
Why so long?

217
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,420
我  我
Um, I--I...

218
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,520
你沒事吧
Are you OK?

219
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,740
請回答
An answer, please.

220
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,550
為什么等了五個月才去看你母親
Why did it take you five months to visit your mother?

221
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,920
-法官大人  請讓我  -不
- Your honor, if I-- - No.

222
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,970
我想聽這個問題的答案
I want to hear this.

223
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,350
我需要時間
I needed time.

224
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,320
我那時
I was...

225
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,800
很生氣  可能是太生氣了
Angry. So angry, perhaps,

226
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,030
所以用了五個月你才原諒她
that it took you five months to forgive her?

227
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,910
事情很復雜
It was complicated.

228
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,590
不  很簡單
No. It's very simple.

229
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,250
你因為你母親的所作所為而責怪她
You blamed your mother for what she had done.

230
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,680
那么陪審團為什么不能
So why shouldn't the jury?

231
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,820
法官大人  我們沒有問題
Your honor, we have no further questions

232
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,320
詢問證人了
for the...witness.

233
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,430
亞當
Adam!

234
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,000
在哪呢
Where is it?

235
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,990
東西在哪呢
Come on, where is it?!

236
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,000
短襪在哪呢
The hosen, where is it?

237
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,250
什么
What?

238
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,500
箭頭
The arrowhead.

239
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,410
所有報告都說這些尸體旁邊都有箭頭
Every report said it was with these bodies.

240
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,350
你說你和朋友曾經在這里
You said you and your friends were here.

241
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,530
現在東西呢
Now, where is it?

242
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,020
把他帶出去
Take him outside.

243
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,260
讓他告訴你他的朋友藏在哪里
Make him show you where his friends are hiding.

244
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,800
帶我們去找他們
Take us to them.

245
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,520
我不知道他們在哪里
I don't know where they are!

246
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,810
告訴我  否則你的手就別想要了
Tell me, or you lose your hand.

247
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,720
我們試試別的選擇
Let us suggest another option.

248
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,400
你把人交給我們  我們就不把你們全殺掉
You hand the kid over to us, and we don't kill you all.

249
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,130
你還好嗎
Hey, are you OK?

250
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,540
不用擔心我  我能承受住
Don't worry about me. I can take it.

251
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,830
和看上去一樣糟糕嗎
Was that as bad as it seemed?

252
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,630
西婭的證詞嗎  確實讓我們受挫
Thea's testimony? It was a set-back.

253
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,170
我們本來指望她來
We were counting on her to--

254
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,310
教化我
Humanize me.

255
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,700
坦白的說  是的
Frankly, yes.

256
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,520
現在我們需要試試別的辦法了
And now we're going to have to go another way.

257
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,900
不不  我跟你說過了  我不會出庭作證的
No. No, I told you, I won't testify.

258
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,600
我知道  但你必需出庭
I know you did. But now you have to.

259
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,770
她是對的  母親
She's right, mom.

260
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,800
珍  能先回避一下嗎
Jean, can you give us a minute?

261
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,000
好的
Yeah.

262
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,700
我知道你要說什么
I know what you're going to say.

263
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,970
但如果我作證  那會毀掉我們的家庭
But if I testify, it will destroy our family.

264
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,640
如果你的律師是對的  你沒有其它選擇
And if your lawyer's right, you don't have a choice.

265
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,930
媽  正是那些秘密讓你陷入現在的困境的
Mom, secrets are what put you in this situation.

266
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,300
秘密和謊言
Secrets and lies.

267
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,160
現在是時候
And now it is time

268
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,490
讓秘密大白于天下了
to give the truth its day.

269
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,400
我們不得不提
Now, I don't want us to lose sight

270
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,720
今天的庭審中的另外一個重要事件
of the other major event in court today.

271
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,730
亞當·唐納犯病之前有什么跡象嗎
Was there any indication of Adam Donner being ill?

272
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,320
沒有  唐納先生倒地前
No, there was very little warning before Mr. Donner

273
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,000
幾乎沒有任何跡象
collapsed to the ground.

274
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,000
我與法庭里
I've spoken to several

275
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,360
和我在一起的幾個人談過了
people that were in the courtroom with me...

276
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,380
感覺如何
How are you feeling?

277
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,780
還好
Fine.

278
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,350
你有張讓人討厭的撲克臉  狄格爾
You have a lousy poker face, Diggle.

279
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,780
他服用解毒劑了嗎
Did he take the antidote?

280
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,490
沒起作用  伯爵肯定改變了配方
Didn't work. The count must have futzed with his recipe.

281
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,480
我聽說了庭審時
Heard what happened with Donner

282
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,100
唐納發生的狀況  還有西婭
at the court, and with Thea.

283
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,990
她怎么樣了
How is she?

284
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,470
會好起來的
Going to be fine.

285
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,770
你的撲克臉不比我好看多少  奧利弗
Your poker face isn't much better than mine, Oliver.

286
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,470
-你好  星城  -費利西蒂
- Hello, Starling City. - Felicity!

287
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,400
想我了沒
Miss me?

288
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,960
你們中的很多人注意到了
Many of you have noticed

289
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,100
你們的身體好像不是自己的
that you're not feeling quite like yourselves...

290
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,570
他控制了所有的本地通信基站
He's taken over all the local station feeds.

291
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,360
追蹤他的信號
Track his signal.

292
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,070
就像我們這位優秀的助理地方檢察官
Like our good assistant district attorney here.

293
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,060
你也許能因為他在正在進行的
You might recognize him from his work

294
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,230
莫伊拉·奎恩的庭審中的工作而認出他
in the ongoing Moira Queen trial.

295
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,540
-你好  亞當  -你想要什么
- Hi, Adam. - What do you want?

296
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,150
和你想要的一樣
I want what you want.

297
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,980
讓你能舒服些
For you to feel better.

298
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,770
死去吧你
Go to hell!

299
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,190
我覺得你希望這種痛苦結束
I do think you want the pain to end,

300
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,870
我可以幫你做到
and I can do that...

301
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,600
用迷魂
with Vertigo.

302
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,950
那是你身體所渴求的全部
It's what all of your bodies crave.

303
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,380
幸運的是  解脫的力量就在這里
Fortunately, the power of relief is right here.

304
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,480
你所需要做的就是去你友好的
And all you have to do is go to your friendly

305
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,140
迷魂供應商鄰居那要一點
neighborhood vertigo dealer and request the cure.

306
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,280
供貨上面  包你滿意
Simply supply and demand at work.

307
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,620
跟我說你想要這個
Now, tell me you want this

308
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,690
那它就是你的了
and it's yours.

309
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,370
所有的痛苦就會立刻  消失
All the pain will just...disappear.

310
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,520
說出來
Say it.

311
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,890
說
Say...

312
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,080
你想要它
You want it.

313
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,090
我  我想  我想要它
I-I--want--I want it.

314
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,900
你看  多簡單的解決辦法
You see...A simple solution.

315
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,990
我是迷魂伯爵
I'm count Vertigo,

316
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,210
不是所有毒品都叫迷魂
and I approve this high.

317
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,580
我們現在做什么
What do we do now?

318
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,550
我們找到他
We find him...

319
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,360
然后干掉他
and we shut him down.

320
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,780
他是在哪里直播的
Where did he broadcast from?

321
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,270
他利用尖端科技研究實驗室的衛星進行信號跳轉
He bounced the signal off of S.T.A.R. Lab's satellite.

322
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,110
他能從馬爾科維亞發送傳輸信號
He could have sent that transmission from Markovia.

323
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,330
他想呆在城里
He would want to stay local.

324
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,700
仔細看視頻  有必要的話一幀一幀查
Scrub the footage, frame by frame if you have to.

325
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,500
一定會有些蛛絲馬跡透露出
There's something on here that gives us a clue

326
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,220
他到底在哪
to where he is.

327
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,490
如果他是在全市散播病毒
If he dosed the whole city,

328
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,340
為什么只有一部分人表現出癥狀
why are only some people showing symptoms?

329
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,780
也許感染是有選擇的
Maybe exposure was selective.

330
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,010
伯爵在只有像你和唐納這樣的人
Count contaminated something that only certain people,

331
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,780
能接觸到的物品里做了手腳
like you and Donner, consumed.

332
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,190
一個戲劇性的變化
A most dramatic turn.

333
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,890
為了避免恐慌擴散
City officials are urging calm,

334
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,320
市政當局呼吁市民保持冷靜
hoping to avoid widespread panic.

335
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,890
副市長萊維茨已經
Deputy Mayor Levitz has...

336
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,660
伯爵已經把星城變成了癮君子樂園
The Count has turned Starling into a city of junkies.

337
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,820
關押唐納檢察官的地方有線索嗎
Any leads on where he's holding A.D.A. Donner?

338
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,690
沒有
Hmm, no.

339
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,330
雖然有點不近人情  但我更擔心其他事
As cold as it sounds, I've got other concerns.

340
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,360
勞蕾爾
Laurel?

341
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,680
亞當的庭審筆記很細致
Adam's trial notes are very thorough.

342
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,040
最好是這樣  你現在要做首席律師了
They better be. You're lead counsel now.

343
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,430
斯賓塞小姐  你才是地方檢察官
Ms. Spencer, you're the District Attorney.

344
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,600
是的  不過陪審團了解你
Yes, but you're the one that the Jury knows.

345
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,460
你會做得很好的  勞蕾爾
You'll do fine, Laurel.

346
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,610
我明白
I know.

347
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,530
我想我找到了亞當的王牌
I just found Adam's trump card.

348
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,320
對不起  我不知道你起來了
Sorry, I didn't hear you woke up.

349
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,710
我只想一個人靜靜
I just want to be left alone.

350
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,680
真遺憾你不能一個人靜靜
Well, too bad that's not an option for you.

351
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,990
不過我有其他辦法
But maybe I know something that is.

352
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,350
揍我
Hit me.

353
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,930
什么
What?

354
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,610
你奇怪為什么我以前總在晚上出去
You wonder why I used to go out at night,

355
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,190
和壞家伙們打架斗毆
looking to throw down with bad guys.

356
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,580
一部分原因是為了拯救這座城市
Part of it was to help the city.

357
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,820
另一部分
And the other part

358
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,380
是為了拯救自己
was to help me.

359
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,790
被一幫街頭混混教訓能拯救你
Getting tuned up by street thugs helped you?

360
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,650
是啊  我也不是省油的燈
Yeah, well, I gave as good as I got.

361
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,750
可以了
There we go.

362
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,970
揮拳的時候  我很憤怒
When I would throw a punch, I'd be so angry.

363
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,570
我會感到怒氣在我體內升騰
I'd feel this heat rising inside of me,

364
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,210
喉嚨里  胸口處
in my jaw, in my chest.

365
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,580
還有拳頭
And my fists.

366
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,320
我需要個地方發泄
But I needed somewhere to go.

367
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,230
來
Come on.

368
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,400
西婭  你很生氣
Thea, you're angry.

369
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,830
可能對你母親  地方檢察官  甚至你自己
At your mother, the D.A., yourself, maybe.

370
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,780
如果你不把怒氣釋放出來
But that anger is going to chew up your insides

371
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,080
它會絞碎你的內心
if you don't let it out.

372
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,850
我不會打你的  羅伊
I'm not going to hit you, Roy.

373
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,850
試試
Try.

374
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,110
試試
Try!

375
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,910
我說了揍我  你剛剛那一下
I said hit me, right? 'Cause that felt like--

376
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,880
我根本沒有感覺
that didn't really feel like anything.

377
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,100
好多了  但要繃直手腕
Better. But keep your wrists straight.

378
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,990
不要只靠胳膊
Don't just use your arm.

379
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,420
把全身的力氣集中到一起
Put your entire body into it.

380
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,050
來  再試試
Come on, again.

381
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,430
至少讓我告訴萊拉
At least let me call Lyla.

382
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,370
她除了擔心什么都不能做
All she could do is worry about me.

383
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,530
我有新發現
I found something.

384
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,210
看不出來有什么
I don't see anything.

385
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,370
你要注意看  唐納看到了什么
Because you have to see what Donner does.

386
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,800
他的眼睛上有反光
His eye caught a reflection.

387
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,090
能放大點嗎
Can you enhance?

388
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,690
你問這種問題是在鄙視我嗎
It hurts me that you feel a need to ask.

389
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,290
那是什么  翅膀
What are those, wings?

390
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,530
這是市政印章
It's the city seal.

391
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,350
星城檔案局
Starling Municipal Records Department.

392
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,390
那棟建筑自從辦公電子化后
That building's been abandoned

393
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,830
已經被廢棄
since the city went to digital.

394
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,680
時過境遷
Dollars to donuts,

395
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,590
現在變成了伯爵實施犯罪的地方
that's where the Count is operating out of.

396
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,950
他不會逍遙很久的
Not for long.

397
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,750
你不該來這里
You shouldn't be here.

398
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,920
-我的律師要  -莫伊拉
- My attorney needs... - Moira.

399
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,550
我知道跟你談話可能會被取消執照
I know I could be disbarred for speaking with you,

400
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,410
但這跟工作無關
but this isn't something for lawyers.

401
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,520
是關于你的家庭
This is a family matter.

402
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,410
簡告訴我  她安排你明天出庭
Jean told me she's calling you to the stand tomorrow.

403
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,670
是的
Yes.

404
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,740
你不能出庭作證
You can't testify.

405
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,510
如果你不想讓我出庭  勞蕾爾
Well. The fact that you don't want me to, Laurel,

406
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,410
正說明我應該去
is a good indication that I should.

407
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,890
如果你出庭  我將不得不盤問你
If you take the stand, I'll have to cross examine you,

408
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,940
也不得不盡我所能
and I'll have to do it to the best of my ability.

409
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,070
-是的  我明白  -不  你不明白
- Yes, I understand. - No, I don't think you do.

410
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,980
先不管這對奧利弗和西婭有什么影響
Forget about what this will do to Oliver and Thea.

411
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,020
它會搞砸你的案子
It also could undermine your entire case.

412
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,400
所以  莫伊拉  拜托
So, Moira, please.

413
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,650
求你了
Please.

414
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,110
別逼我這么做
Don't make me use this.

415
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,810
你的一切都命懸一線
Everything is at stake for you.

416
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,620
我不想做那個奪走你一切的人
And I don't want to be the one to take it all away.

417
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,970
快點  拜托
Faster, please.

418
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,480
快  我們有一整座城的顧客
Faster! We have a city full of customers.

419
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,560
一點都不夸張
And I mean this literally.

420
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,630
恐怕我的生產設備對于如此高的需求量
I'm afraid my production apparatus is a little over-taxed

421
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,480
有點力不從心  雖然我能容忍
with the increased demand. I can live with it, though.

422
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,090
這座城市可不一定
I can't say the city can.

423
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,290
快走
Go.

424
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,320
別搗亂  我的小心肝
Be still, my heart.

425
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,890
離他們遠點
Step away from them.

426
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,100
我聽說你現在對殺人有點過敏
Yes, I've heard you've developed an allergy to killing.

427
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,210
-快點  -否則呢
- Do it! - Or what?

428
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,250
你會殺我嗎
You'll kill me?

429
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,270
你真成了不殺戮一族
You're really on the no killing wagon?

430
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,460
真遺憾
Shame.

431
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,060
那你可就失去人生一大樂趣了
Really letting one of life's true pleasures pass you by.

432
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,860
你說過你不想出庭作證
But you said you didn't want to testify.

433
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,020
可是你不得不去
But you have to.

434
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,580
-因為我  -不
- Because of me. - No.

435
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,770
你不得不控制損失
You have to do damage control.

436
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,100
這不是你的錯
None of this is your fault.

437
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,940
我們走到這一步是因為我的所作所為
We're here because of what I did.

438
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,200
現在你們都知道真相了
Now, you both know the truth,

439
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,700
但你們不知道全部真相
but you don't know all of it.

440
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,730
勞蕾爾知道
Laurel does.

441
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,070
她知道什么
What does she have?

442
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,310
你們不應該從法庭上才知道
You shouldn't have to find this out in court.

443
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,930
知道什么
Find out what?

444
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,370
若干年前  很多年前
Years ago-- it was many yes ago...

445
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,960
你們的父親正在搞他的
Your father was engaging in his--

446
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,150
他的出軌行為
his extramarital activities.

447
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,040
我當時心志不堅
And I had a moment of weakness.

448
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,790
我也出軌了
I cheated on him.

449
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,620
跟馬爾科姆·梅林
With Malcolm Merlyn.

450
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,790
不
No.

451
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,860
不  我
No, I--

452
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,280
我問過你這事兒
I asked you about this.

453
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,400
去年
Last year.

454
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,940
你說你們倆之間什么都沒有
You said that there was nothing between you two!

455
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,710
是沒有  甜心  我跟他不是什么婚外情
There wasn't. Sweetheart, it wasn't an affair.

456
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,100
非常短暫  而且已經是很久以前了
It was very brief, and a long time ago.

457
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,750
盡管如此  你還是跟梅林先生保持朋友關系
And despite it, you remained friends with Mr. Merlyn.

458
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,570
事實上  他經常參加你們家的派對
In fact, he frequently attended parties at your home.

459
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:31,890
馬爾科姆殺害我丈夫之前是他最好的朋友
He was my husband's best friend until Malcolm killed him.

460
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,360
這就是為什么你聲稱
And this is why you claimed to feel

461
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,090
你覺得自己和你孩子
as though you were in fear for your life

462
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,290
遭到生命威脅
and the lives of your children?

463
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,390
我覺得這個理由足夠讓人信服了
Well, I think it's a fairly compelling reason.

464
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,880
去年
Last year,

465
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,040
你的第二任丈夫  沃爾特·斯蒂爾
your second husband, Walter Steel,

466
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,040
被梅林先生綁架了  對嗎
was abducted by Mr. Merlyn, is that correct?

467
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,560
是的  如你所說
Yes. So you are saying.

468
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,820
為什么梅林不殺了沃爾特
Why didn't Merlyn kill Walter,

469
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,430
就像他殺掉你第一任丈夫一樣呢
the same as your first husband?

470
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,810
我說服了馬爾科姆不那么做
I convinced Malcolm not to.

471
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,680
馬爾科姆聽從了你的話
And Malcolm listened to you.

472
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,960
你的朋友饒了沃爾特的命
Your friend spared Walter's life,

473
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,100
你卻想讓陪審團相信
and yet, you'd have this jury believing

474
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,890
你和你的孩子當時有生命危險嗎
that you and your children were in danger?

475
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,510
是的  我擔心
We were. I was afraid--

476
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,980
擔心被抓起來
Afraid of getting caught.

477
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,770
不管我年輕時候犯過什么錯
Despite whatever youthful mistakes I might have made,

478
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,080
馬爾科姆·梅林都是個危險分子
Malcolm Merlyn was a dangerous man.

479
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,420
那是對其他人而言
To other people.

480
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,340
但是真正對莫伊拉·奎恩和她的家人
But the only person who truly posed a danger

481
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,260
造成威脅的人
to Moira Queen and her family

482
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,420
就是莫伊拉·奎恩自己
was Moira Queen.

483
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,410
如果你想打我  那你就打吧
Ok, if you want to attack me, go right ahead.

484
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,950
但你想對我說的每一句話
But you should know that you're not going to say anything

485
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,510
我都對自己說過了
that I haven't already said to myself.

486
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,920
我知道這對你來說很艱難
Whoa. I know that that was difficult for you,

487
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,700
我只想關心一下你是不是還好
and I just want to make sure that you're ok.

488
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,670
不  不
No, no.

489
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,050
我不明白在我剛剛的所作所為之后
I don't understand how you can forgive me

490
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,790
你怎么還能原諒我
after what I just did in there.

491
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,250
換了任何人都不會原諒我
I don't understand how anyone could.

492
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,540
顯然  是你們三個
So, obviously you three

493
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,490
把靈符拿出了山洞
took the hosen out of this cave.

494
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,470
把他抬起來
Lift him up.

495
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,440
我現在知道不是他拿的
Now I know he doesn't have it,

496
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,290
所以就是你們倆其中一個
which means one of you two does.

497
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,180
把它給我  我們來談談交換條件
Give it to me, and we'll discuss an exchange.

498
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,950
我們不知道你在說什么
We don't know what you're talking about.

499
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,710
把奧利弗交給我們
Give us Oliver,

500
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,600
我們就讓你們自己去找
and we'll leave you alone to look for it.

501
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,390
還有人想做蠢事嗎
Anybody else want to be stupid?

502
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,260
好吧  把他帶走
Fine. Take 'em.

503
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,630
給他松綁
Cut him loose.

504
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,670
你要干什么
What are you doing?!

505
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,550
我們不能停下來  他們跟上來了
We have to keep moving, they're following us!

506
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,400
我們知道
We know.

507
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,870
顯然  我們還將繼續關注
Obviously we're continuing to monitor

508
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,420
這些重大事件
both of these major stories

509
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,300
今天  星城因為它們而全市嘩然
in what has become a significant news day here in Starling.

510
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,300
{\an8}莫伊拉·奎恩承認有婚外情

511
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,940
你能告訴我們關于
What can you tell us about--

512
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,140
奧利弗會被他母親的事情重重包圍
Oliver's going to be pretty wrapped up with his mother.

513
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,290
關于"伯爵"是怎么把"迷魂"
You making any process on how the Count's

514
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,950
弄到人體內的  你搞明白了嗎
getting Vertigo into people's systems?

515
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,350
沒什么進展
Not much.

516
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,290
每個點都是出現戒斷癥狀的人的家
Each dot is the home of somebody with withdrawal symptoms.

517
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,680
看起來很隨機
That seems pretty random.

518
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,360
因為的確很隨機
That's because it's very random.

519
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,580
好吧
Ok.

520
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,920
有沒有可能他們不是在家里中招的
What if people weren't exposed at home,

521
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,480
而是在工作時被下藥的呢
what if they got dosed at work?

522
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,590
你能用他們的工作地點建立聯系嗎
Can you do this by their employment addresses?

523
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,730
我真的要好好想想
I'm really starting to wonder

524
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,360
怎么才能讓你們刮目相看了
what it would take to impress you guys.

525
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,120
是一條路徑  穿過城市
It's a trail. A path through the city.

526
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,100
你去過其中任何地點嗎
Any place you've been?

527
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,080
戴爾街59號  我在那里打的流感疫苗
59th and Dell, that's where I got my flu shot.

528
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,760
你是在這些車上打的疫苗  對嗎
You got your vaccination from one of those trucks, right?

529
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,230
其中一輛流動疫苗車
One of those roving flu trucks?

530
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,000
{\an8}星城移動醫療

531
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,760
這條路徑
The route.

532
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,950
是流感疫苗車的行動路線
It's a flu vaccination tour.

533
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,910
星城移動醫療派出的疫苗車
A truck sent out by Starling City Mobile Care.

534
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,840
打了一針我就上癮了  這可能嗎
I got addicted after one injection? That can happen?

535
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,980
當然可能  不信試試海洛因
Sure. Try heroin some time.

536
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,480
不要試
Not try...try.

537
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,260
好吧  這車現在在哪里
All right, where's the truck now?

538
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,780
城區  你想怎么辦
Downtown. What do you think?

539
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,170
通知奧利弗嗎
Call Oliver?

540
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,060
不不  他現在家事纏身  我去
No, no, he's busy with his family. I'll go.

541
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,640
不行  不能讓你去
Yeah, no. That's not happening.

542
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,300
我去
I'll go.

543
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,300
費利西蒂  太危險了
Felicity, it's too dangerous.

544
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,210
不會有事的  如果有事  我會叫你的
It could turn out to be nothing. If it's not, I'll call.

545
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,890
...您正在觀看的法庭劇
...courtroom drama you've just witnessed?

546
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,820
貝瑟尼  沒人料到取證結果會是這樣
Bethany, no one expected the turn that testimony took.

547
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,290
莫伊拉·奎恩與馬爾科姆·梅林
A revelation that Moira Queen

548
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,460
曾經的一段戀情曝光
once had an affair with Malcolm Merlyn

549
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,130
成為公訴人盤問的火力點
became the sole focus of the prosecution's cross.

550
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,560
有人嗎
Hello?

551
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,540
有人在家嗎
Anybody home?

552
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,760
"迷魂"  被我逮到啦
Vertigo. Got ya.

553
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,810
有意思
Funny, eh?

554
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,920
你把我的臺詞搶先說了
You took the words right out of my mouth.

555
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,550
西婭
Thea?

556
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,450
今晚就到此為止吧
Can we call it a night?

557
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,020
陪審團表示他們可能能出結果了
Jury just signaled that they could have a verdict.

558
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,620
法官不會讓他們回家的
Judge will not send them home.

559
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,080
他希望能結束這案子
He wants to get this over with.

560
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,500
我也想快點結束這案子啊
Line forms behind me.

561
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,050
這么快就能出結果  恐怕不妙吧
A verdict that quickly is bad, isn't it?

562
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,320
我覺得你倆得做好最壞的打算
I think the two of you should prepare for the worst.

563
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,020
我接個電話
Excuse me.

564
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,100
費利西蒂
Felicity...

565
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,100
奧利弗
Oliver.

566
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,450
你不介意我叫你奧利弗吧
Is it ok if I call you Oliver?

567
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,190
聽到我的聲音覺得很意外吧
Surprised to hear from me, right?

568
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,860
但我比你還意外
Not as surprised as I was.

569
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,220
你看  我發現這位
You see, I find this

570
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,440
長得不太美的金發小妞直闖我的地盤
not unattractive blonde getting all up in my business.

571
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,770
她身上有什么呢
And what does she have on her?

572
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,920
奎恩聯合企業的工作牌
A Queen Consolidated I.D. badge.

573
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,710
我問自己  為什么這個名字這么耳熟呢
Now, I think to myself, why does that name ring a bell?

574
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,880
奧利弗·奎恩
Oliver Queen.

575
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,160
去年他想收買我
He tried to buy off me last year,

576
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,430
隨后我就被兜帽男送進了軟墊病室
just before the hood put me in a padded cell.

577
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:40,250
也就是  綠箭俠
Ipso facto, Arrow.

578
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,160
你去哪兒
Where are you going?!

579
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,750
我辦公室出了點事
Something's come up at the office.

580
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,980
奧利  陪審團還沒出結果呢
Ollie, the jury!

581
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,030
我必須得走了
I have to go.

582
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,430
時髦花哨的辦公室啊
Pretty swanky offices.

583
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,720
在這兒你可以看到你母親造成的所有破壞
You can see all the destruction that your mom caused from up here.

584
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,620
你想干什么
What do you want?

585
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,930
世界和平和個人滿足
World peace and personal satisfaction.

586
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,460
不過順序倒可以反過來
Though not necessarily in that order.

587
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,690
你給我下藥  把我關進監獄
You poisoned me and put me in a hole.

588
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,160
你不知道為此我有多恨你
You have no idea how much I hated you for that.

589
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,190
結果恨你的還不止我一個
Turns out, someone else hates you, too.

590
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,000
-還有誰  -誰
- Who? - Who?

591
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,450
你發現之后會大吃一驚的
Oh, you're going to be surprised when you find out.

592
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,710
他是個有錢人
He's a man of means.

593
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,310
支持我的新事業好讓我把你引出來
Set me up with my new operation so I could draw you out.

594
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,240
-你想干什么  -殺了你
- To do what? - This.

595
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,730
那你得再努力點
You're going to have to try harder.

596
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,900
去死吧
Done!

597
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,630
過來
Come on! Ahh!

598
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,080
現在我們采用方案二
So now we move on to plan b.

599
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,190
奧利弗  別  別為了我做傻事
Oliver, don't! Not for me!

600
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,880
安靜點好嗎  我在威脅他呢
Quiet, please. I'm threatening.

601
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,270
放下你的弓
Lower your bow.

602
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,510
你要找的人是我
Your problem is with me.

603
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,480
與她無關
It's not with her.

604
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,310
那就把這當做是
Well, then, consider this your penalty

605
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,980
逼我采用方案二的處罰吧
for making me go to plan b in the first place.

606
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,550
沒事了
It's all right.

607
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,100
你安全了
You're safe.

608
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,480
你中彈了
Oh, you were shot.

609
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,540
沒什么大不了
Hey. It's nothing.

610
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,120
有什么消息嗎
Any news?

611
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,290
你去哪兒了
Where have you been?

612
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,400
奎恩企業那兒出了點事
Something... Happened at Queen Consolidated.

613
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,920
一會兒看新聞你就知道了
You will see it on the news later.

614
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,770
現在先別擔心
Just don't worry about it.

615
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,920
如果有結果了你要怎么辦
What would you have done if there'd been a verdict?

616
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:13,500
西婭  我不知道
Thea... I don't know.

617
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,040
你還好嗎
Are you OK?

618
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,540
陪審團回來了
Hey. Jury's back.

619
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,180
走吧
Come on.

620
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:27,210
我收到了陪審團出結果的紙條了
I have received a note that the jury has arrived at a verdict.

621
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,850
請公布裁決
Please publish the verdict.

622
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,950
星郡最高法院
In the superior court of Star County

623
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,080
對州檢察院向莫伊拉·奎恩提起的
State versus Moira Queen verdict...

624
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:43,000
一級陰謀指控的裁決是
on one count of conspiracy in the first degree,

625
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,900
被告無罪
the defendant is found not guilty.

626
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,770
對另外503案件謀殺指控的裁決是
On the 503 counts of murder in the first degree,

627
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,630
被告...
the defendant is found...

628
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,990
無罪
not guilty.

629
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,630
媽媽
Mom.

630
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,940
我太愛你們了
I love you both so much.

631
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,860
令人震驚的結果  莫伊拉·奎恩無罪釋放
A stunning result, as Moira Queen is acquitted of all charges.

632
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,780
{\an8}莫伊拉·奎恩無罪釋放

633
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,430
就在今天
In a day that's provided

634
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,700
一周以來的沖擊和法律糾紛
a week's worth of shocks and legal twists,

635
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,060
在大多數人看來已經落幕
many had pronounced this case a done deal.

636
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,400
恭喜
Congratulations.

637
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,230
這么說合適嗎
Is that appropriate?

638
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,750
她不該贏這場官司的
She should have lost.

639
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,140
她應該被判有罪
She should have been convicted.

640
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,900
你希望她那樣
Did you want her to be?

641
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,170
我認為她有罪
I expected her to be.

642
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,890
這裁決根本不合理
Verdict doesn't make sense.

643
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,120
但你媽媽肯定很高興吧  難以言喻的高興
Still, your mom must be thrilled. Beyond.

644
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,550
更確切地說是驚嚇
It's more like shock, I think.

645
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,560
他們正在收尾  我想來看看你
They're processing her now. I just wanted to check in on you.

646
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,460
還有你
And you.

647
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,770
我好多了
I'm feeling better.

648
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,270
而且  有了迷魂疫苗
And, with the Vertigo tainted vaccine,

649
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,180
奎恩聯合企業的應用科學部門
Queen Consolidated's applied sciences division

650
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,520
發明了不會上癮的治療方法
was able to formulate a non-addictive treatment.

651
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,830
很好
Good.

652
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,680
我得回家見我的家人
I need to meet my family at home.

653
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,340
你們也回去好好休息吧
So you guys go home, get rest.

654
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,760
晚安
Good night.

655
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,030
晚安
Good night.

656
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,220
奧利弗  我
Oliver. I, uh...

657
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,370
-我想向你道謝  -沒事
- I just wanted to say thank you. - Yeah.

658
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,900
我很抱歉
And I'm sorry.

659
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,300
為什么
For what?

660
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,730
我又惹上了麻煩  你只能殺了他
I got myself into trouble again, and you... killed him.

661
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,480
你又開始了殺戮  我很抱歉
You killed again, and I am sorry that I was the one

662
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,890
因為我  你做出了這樣的艱難抉擇
to put you in a position where you had to make that kind of choice.

663
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,060
費利西蒂
Felicity...

664
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,750
他抓住了你  還企圖傷害你
He had you, and he was going to hurt you.

665
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,060
那個抉擇很容易
There was no choice to make.

666
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,190
你為什么那么做
Why did you do that?!

667
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,090
因為你曾經救過我一命
Because you stopped the captain from killing me.

668
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,100
謝謝你能來
Thank you for coming.

669
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,530
莎朵 他看起來不太好
Shado, he doesn't look too good.

670
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,340
他確實不好  這是誰
He's not. Who's this?

671
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,610
說來話長  他們要找的
It's complicated. That hosen thing

672
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,500
那個護身符還在飛機上
they're looking for is back on the plane.

673
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,120
不  在我這里
No, I've got it.

674
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,600
一面刻著佛教的文字
It has a buddhist inscription on one side.

675
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,950
讓我想起我的父親
It reminded me of my father.

676
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,770
我敢肯定他們不是沖著佛教來的
I'm pretty sure they aren't interested in buddhism.

677
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:45,980
另一面有什么
What's on the other side?

678
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,270
30-30-175-12
30-30-175-12.

679
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,810
一串數字
Ok, numbers, what...

680
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,080
是坐標
Coordinates.

681
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,760
什么坐標
To what?

682
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,570
一艘二戰期間擱淺在這里
A kairyu-class japanese submarine

683
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,660
海龍級的日本潛水艇
which ran aground here during world war II.

684
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,570
這些人為什么要找一艘70年前的潛水艇
What do these guys want with a 70 year old sub?

685
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,900
潛艇本身并不重要  但上面的東西
The sub isn't important, but what's on it...

686
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,820
能夠拯救人類
It'll save the human race.

687
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,180
能救他嗎
Will it save him?

688
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:26,050
恭喜你  沒有因為自己的愚蠢而死
Well, you survived your own stupidity, congratulations.

689
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:32,680
你知道嗎  我還指望你能夠應對
You know... I needed you to deal with any resistance

690
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,650
在島上遇到的抵抗  我得說
that I encountered on the island. I got to say,

691
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,840
你做得并不好
you've done a fairly lousy job of that.

692

恭喜你
Congratulations.

693
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,590
你升任為新船長了
You're the new captain.

694
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,590
{\an8}綠箭俠再開殺戒

695
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,240
我安排"伯爵"干掉綠箭俠
I arranged for the count to take out the Arrow,

696
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,900
{\an8}綠箭俠再開殺戒

697
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,490
結果卻是讓他
And all I accomplish is reigniting

698
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,030
重新開始了殺戮
the vigilante's killing spree.

699
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,310
先生  有進展了
Sir, there's been a development.

700

塞勒斯兄弟
Brother Cyrus...

701
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,730
你感覺如何

702
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,370
更強大了
Stronger.

703

很好
Good.

704

你已經準備好了
Then you're ready.

705
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,330
奎恩女士  擺脫謀殺罪名的感覺如何
Mrs. Queen, how does it feel to get away with murder?

706
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,670
你出去以后  有輛車等著你
Once you go out back, there's a car waiting for you.

707
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,110
是你殺了自己的第一任丈夫嗎
Did you kill your first husband?

708
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,280
別理他們  繼續走
Just keep going.

709
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,900
很明顯奎恩女士對于陪審團
Obviously Mrs. Queen is overjoyed that the jury

710
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:56,430
{\an8}法庭速遞  入口

711
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,190
判定她是迫于威脅感到非常滿意
has ruled that she was acting under terrible duress.

712
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,100
這邊請  奎恩女士
This way, Mrs. Queen.

713
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,530
走高速公路比較快
The freeway will be quicker.

714
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,130
抱歉  奎恩女士
I'm sorry, Mrs. Queen.

715
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,950
有人命令我不要帶你回家
I was instructed not to take you home.

716
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,250
至少暫時不要
Not yet.

717
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:38,580
這是哪里
Where are we?

718
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,090
我不認識這里
I-I don't know this place.

719
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,440
我把她帶來了  先生
I've got her, sir.

720
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,220
你要干什么
What do you want?

721
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,270
你好  莫伊拉
Hello, Moira.

722
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,840
你不是  你不是已經死了嗎
You were supposed...they said you were dead!

723
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,990
在世上的某些地方  死亡不過是幻覺
There are parts of the world where death is an illusion.

724
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,140
我去過一處
I've been to one.

725
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,030
我學會了完美地偽裝
I learned to be very convincing.

726
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,560
但我回來是因為你需要我的幫助

727

什么幫助
Help?

728
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,150
你的庭審
With your trial.

729
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,700
難道你覺得陪審團無緣無故
You didn't think that jury acquitted you

730
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,250
就會宣布你無罪嗎
without a little persuasion?

731
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,070
天哪
Dear god.

732
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,420
你想怎么樣  馬爾科姆
What do you want, Malcolm?

733
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,820
我在星城還有勢力
I still have resources in Starling.

734
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,080
人脈
Associates.

735
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,600
在地方檢察官辦公室也有
Including one in the D.A.'s office.

736
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,500
我跟進了唐納先生對你的調查
I followed Mr. Donner's investigation of you with interest.

737
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:38,260
這么多年你如此輕松地隱瞞我們的事
The ease with which you lied about us for years,

738
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,440
讓我思索你是不是騙了我
it made me wonder whether you lied to me.

739
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,880
我沒有
No. No.

740
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:46,580
我暗地里做了一個小小的親子測試
It was a matter of a simple surreptitious genetics test

741
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,220
證實了我的懷疑
to confirm my suspicion.

742
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,320
別
Don't.

743
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,700
猜猜我在發現西婭是我女兒時有多高興
Imagine my joy at learning that Thea is my daughter.
