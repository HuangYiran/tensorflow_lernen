00:08:41,012 --> 00:08:43,791
说明我不是全部都石头做的
Makes me not completely
made of stone.

138
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:45,417
至少还不是
Yet.

139
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:51,225
我再给你调配3组人马
I'm giving you
three extra units.

140
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:55,764
我要让Jax全天被监视
I want 24/7 surveillance
on Jax Teller.

141
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,707
你觉得这是利用资源的最佳方式?
ROOSEVELT: You think that's really
the best use of our resources?

142
00:09:00,658 --> 00:09:02,418
长官 我了解这些人
Ma'am, I know these guys.

143
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:05,700
上了头条之后 他们会像童子军一样乖
After those headlines,
they'll go total Boy Scout.

144
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,447
不会冒险做生意
Won't risk any business.

145
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:11,215
要坚持和耐心
PATTERSON: It's about
consistency and patience.

146
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:15,552
一旦我们对他们放松警惕了
The minute we ease up, turn our
backs, look the other way,

147
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:19,258
他们指不定会犯出什么事
that's the minute we allow
another tragedy to happen.

148
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:25,788
你对对他们严盯死守没疑问吧 中尉
You don't have a problem stepping hard
on these guys, do you, Lieutenant?

149
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:28,285
不 我没有
ROOSEVELT: No. I don't.

150
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:31,477
很好 监视马上开始
PATTERSON: Good. Surveillance
begins immediately.

151
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:33,986
一小时内给你增援
You'll have backup
within the hour.

152
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:39,680
(door opens, closes)

153
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:43,764
(blowing kazoo)

154
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,745
(Jax sighs)

155
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:12,252
(blowing kazoo)

156
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:13,735
窗户擦得不错 Chucky
JAX: Looking clean, Chucky.

157
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,597
谢谢
CHUCK (through kazoo):
Thank you.

158
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:17,925
这就是为什么你是个异类
JAX: And that's why
you're a freak.

159
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:20,923
兄弟 欢迎回来
Hey. Welcome back, my brother.

160
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:22,068
嗨 兄弟
HAPPY: Hey, buddy.

161
00:10:22,927 --> 00:10:25,111
爱尔兰人那边怎么样
JAX: How'd the Irish
sales pitch go?

162
00:10:25,187 --> 00:10:27,253
挺好的 和我们大部分的买家都接上头了
HAPPY: Good, man. Connected
with most of our buyers.

163
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:32,280
他们还想和Clay谈谈 但是似乎也想改变
They still want to talk to Clay,
but they seemed open to change.

164
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,884
他们明白我们为什么退出了
They get why we're
stepping away.

165
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:34,940
这就好
JAX: Good.

166
00:10:35,023 --> 00:10:37,068
还没意大利人谈过
BOBBY: Couldn't get a
sit-down with the Italians.

167
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:40,586
我觉得他们队伍换血不会太顺利
I don't think the personnel change
is gonna land too well with them.

168
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:43,097
爱尔兰人在操作这件事
CHIBS: Irish are setting it up.

169
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:47,738
他们在监狱里有人给Clay了个电话
让他能联系外面
They got someone inside that's gonna get
a phone to Clay, have him reach out.

170
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:50,391
- 让所有的买家都停手
- 好的
- Lock down all the buyers.
JAX: - All right.

171
00:10:50,802 --> 00:10:53,489
在他们联系Clay之后 你盯着所有人
You follow up with everyone
after they talk to Clay.

172
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,549
好
CHIBS: Aye.

173
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:56,127
(electronic doorbell chimes)

174
00:10:56,229 --> 00:10:57,390
早
UNSER: Morning.

175
00:10:58,723 --> 00:10:59,939
不好意思打扰你们了
Sorry to interrupt.

176
00:11:00,072 --> 00:11:02,223
哇 你还没躺尸？
BOBBY: Wow. You didn't die yet?

177
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:04,609
每天趴下一点
UNSER: A little every day.

178
00:11:05,193 --> 00:11:06,255
(men chuckling)

179
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:10,024
- 能见到你真好 长官
- 是啊 你也是 Bobby
BOBBY: - Good to see you, Chief.
UNSER: - Yeah, you, too, Bobby.

180
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,777
你需要什么 大队长
JAX: What do you
need, Cap-a-tain?

181
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:14,368
只想站用点你的时间 主席
UNSER: Just a minute of
your time there, Pres.

182
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:16,718
没问题
JAX: Yeah, okay.

183
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:20,670
麻烦各位了
UNSER: Excuse us, gentlemen.

184
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,564
- 我在楼上和你谈
- 可以 没问题
JAX: - I'll see you upstairs.
BOBBY: - Yeah, all right.

185
00:11:24,371 --> 00:11:25,876
你要咖啡吗
JAX: Can I get you some coffee?

186
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:28,077
你有 呃 啤酒吗
UNSER: You got any,
uh, beer back there?

187
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:30,632
及时享乐了?
JAX: Miller time already?

188
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:33,891
终极病殃的早餐
UNSER: Breakfast of
terminally-ill champions.

189
00:11:34,216 --> 00:11:35,401
坐下吧
JAX: Sit down.

190
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:42,288
我想让你知道
Hey, I wanted you to know.

191
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,137
Tara告诉我了 你对她和孩子们很照顾
Tara told me how good you've
been with her and the boys.

192
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,431
这些破事缠身 都没机会和你说谢谢
With all the shit going on,
haven't had a chance to say

193
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:51,738
但是真的很感激你能照顾他们
thank you, but appreciate
you looking out, man.

194
00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:53,495
没事
UNSER: Yeah.

195
00:11:53,703 --> 00:11:56,073
嗯 没问题
It's, uh, no problem.

196
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:59,416
你有一个好家庭 孩子
You got a real nice
family there, son.

197
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,844
是啊 一部分吧
JAX: Yeah, some of them.

198
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,551
也是
UNSER: Right.

199
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:10,824
我知道这也许不是我该管的事情 但是
I know it probably ain't none
of my business, but...

200
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:13,586
我认识你妈比谁都久
I know your mom longer than anybody.

201
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:19,669
我们还是孩子的时候在这吃饭撒欢
We used to dine and dash this
place when we were kids.

202
00:12:19,926 --> 00:12:21,346
是啊 我也是
JAX: Yeah, me, too.

203
00:12:23,182 --> 00:12:25,751
听着 我知道你关心我妈 Wayne
Look, I know you care
about my mom, Wayne.

204
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:31,056
- 不只是这样 孩子
- 天啊
UNSER: - It's not just that, son...
JAX: - Jesus Christ.

205
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,728
- 这是干什么?
UNSER: What the hell?

206
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:36,819
喂 你他妈在干嘛
JAX: Hey! What the
hell you doing?!

207
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:37,812
哇 哦
UNSER: Whoa... whoa!

208
00:12:38,002 --> 00:12:40,202
哦 干什么呢这是
Oh! What the hell?!

209
00:12:40,298 --> 00:12:41,593
喂
JAX: Hey!

210
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,140
(Chucky blowing kazoo sadly)

211
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:44,532
我的天啊
UNSER: Holy shit!

212
00:12:49,282 --> 00:12:50,729
喂
JAX: Hey!

213
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:54,095
喂
Hey!

214
00:12:56,147 --> 00:12:57,274
喂
Hey!

215
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,013
喂
Hey!

216
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:02,032
- 放开我
- 你谁啊
GIRL: - Let go of me!
JAX: - Who are you?

217
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:04,479
喂 你干嘛做这些啊
Hey! Why'd you do that?

218
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:07,355
强奸 强奸
GIRL: Rape! Rape!

219
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,490
真的要这样?
JAX: Seriously?

220
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:09,957
放开我 来人...帮...
GIRL: Let go of me! Somebody...
take...!

221
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:11,804
好吧 好吧
JAX: All right! All right!

222
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,134
(people murmuring)

223
00:13:14,224 --> 00:13:15,234
怎么了这是
MAN: What's that all about?

224
00:13:15,363 --> 00:13:17,928
你应该拿好你的枪骑车快走
MAN 2: You need to take your guns
and your loud bikes and just go.

225
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:19,618
你们都该离开这儿
WOMAN: You all need
to get out of here.

226
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,466
- 欢迎
- 谢谢
INMATE: - Welcome.
CLAY: - Thanks.

227
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,506
- 谢谢你能来
INMATE: Thanks for coming.

228
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,146
- 欢迎 进来吧
PREACHER: Welcome. Come on in.

229
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:31,389
你好
INMATE: How you doing?

230
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:34,593
欢迎 欢迎
PREACHER: Welcome. Welcome.

231
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,130
你来了真好 快进来
Good to see you. Good.
Come on in.

232
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,478
很好
Good.

233
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:39,806
(door closes)

234
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:43,794
我想谢谢你们今天的到来 先生们
I'd like to thank you all,
gentlemen, for coming today.

235
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,726
很明智的选择
You made the right choice.

236
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:52,356
今天我们读约翰书8:32 真相的力量(圣经)
Today's reading is from John
8:32 on power of truth.

237
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:57,479
请你们翻开圣经
Will you all now please
open your Bibles.

238
00:13:57,876 --> 00:13:59,902
他是Gary Putner的孩子
UNSER: It was Gary Putner's kid.

239
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,238
他12岁就开始进出少年监狱和康复教育
She's been in and out of juvie
and rehab since she was 12.

240
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:06,401
是有些问题
Got a few problems.

241
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:09,232
是啊 她用了一个扳手来解决问题
JAX: Yeah. She's working
them out with a pipe wrench.

242
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,864
为什么是我的车
TIG: Why my bike?

243
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:17,411
我说 真的吗 每个青少年女孩子都恨我
I mean, really? Do all
teenage girls just hate me?

244
00:14:17,548 --> 00:14:19,599
- 对
- 没错
JAX: - Yes.
CHIBS: - Yep.

245
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:21,376
(men chuckling)

246
00:14:21,497 --> 00:14:23,445
哦 好的吧
TIG: Oh. Yeah.

247
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:27,098
- 有人认识这个叫Putner的吗
- Clay也许认识
JAX: - We know this Putner guy?
UNSER: - Clay might have.

248
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:30,816
在他给Oswald工作之前是个机械师
He was a journeyman mechanic
before he went to work for Oswald.

249
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:33,695
他在作坊那当领班
He's an equipment
foreman at the mill.

250
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:35,762
好吧 但是我们从来没和他打过交道
BOBBY: Yeah, but we never had
a beef with the guy--

251
00:14:35,857 --> 00:14:38,926
- 至少我记得没有
- 没妈妈?
- not that I can remember.
CHIBS: - No mother?

252
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,890
她死了 交通事故
UNSER: She was killed.
Car accident.

253
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:44,646
18号高速公路 刚生下孩子
Highway 18, just after
the kid was born.

254
00:14:46,617 --> 00:14:48,601
这可能说明了些问题
That might be the connection.

255
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:53,191
是拖车引起的连带事故
It was the pile-up caused by the
tractor-trailer,

256
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:56,575
击中你爸之后 她被切断了
jackknifed after it hit your dad.

257
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:02,635
所以她把他妈妈的死算在了我们的头上
JAX: So she blames us
for her mother's death.

258
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:04,531
过了18年之后?
BOBBY: 18 years later?

259
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:09,052
不知道啊 有人默哀的方式很奇特
UNSER: I don't know. People
grieve in strange ways.

260
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:14,343
- 啊 该死
- 他们来这是因为那个女孩?
JUICE: - Ah, shit.
- Think they're here 'cause of the girl?

261
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:15,738
想让我打探一下吗
UNSER: Want me to go find out?

262
00:15:15,853 --> 00:15:18,047
不用 我来好了
JAX: No, I got it.

263
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:21,361
(electronic doorbell chimes)

264
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:25,720
早
Morning.

265
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:26,935
早
ROOSEVELT: Yeah.

266
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,666
这发生什么了
What happened there?

267
00:15:30,203 --> 00:15:31,510
不知道啊
JAX: I don't know.

268
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:34,030
很明显 有些人不喜欢冰激凌
Clearly someone doesn't
like ice cream.

269
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:37,372
非常不喜欢 乳糖不耐症是吗
ROOSEVELT: Extremely
lactose intolerant, huh?

270
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:39,839
- 对 就是这个
- 嗯
JAX: - That's right.
ROOSEVELT: - Hmm.

271
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:43,028
我猜你不是为了我的破窗户才来的吧
JAX: Guessing you're not
here about my broken window.

272
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:45,362
的确 我不是
ROOSEVELT: No, I'm not.

273
00:15:47,716 --> 00:15:50,031
这段时间有人会跟着你们
You're gonna have a shadow
for a little while.

274
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:52,220
不是我决定的
It's not my call.

275
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:55,896
Patterson?
JAX: Patterson?

276
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:57,484
她在找枪的来源
ROOSEVELT: She's looking
for the gun source,

277
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,019
而且她只有一个怀疑对象
and she only has
one suspect on her list.

278
00:16:01,469 --> 00:16:02,876
好吧
JAX: Okay.

279
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:05,136
跟踪是板上钉了
ROOSEVELT: This tail
is gonna happen.

280
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,108
别搞破坏了 好不
Let's not make it
ugly, all right?

281
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:11,512
- 不会 我明白
- 那就好
JAX: - No, I get it.
ROOSEVELT: - All right.

282
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,049
伙计们
Fellas.

283
00:16:17,785 --> 00:16:19,382
妈的
BOBBY: Shit.

284
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,171
(cell phone ringing)

285
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:23,838
我们的新尾巴
JAX: Our new tail.

286
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:26,675
这可不好 Jackie
CHIBS: This is bad, Jackie.

287
00:16:26,831 --> 00:16:29,450
未来一周我们可是会非常忙
We got a very, very
busy week ahead of us.

288
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:31,212
我知道
JAX: I know.

289
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:34,554
我们要把刚才的谈话完结了
UNSER: We need to finish
that conversation.

290
00:16:35,064 --> 00:16:36,391
会的
JAX: We will.

291
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:39,236
好吧 是Barosky
JUICE: All right. It's Barosky.

292
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:40,710
他说很紧急
Says it's urgent.

293
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:44,089
嗯 他必须来找我们
JAX: Well, he's gonna
have to come to us.

294
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:45,944
在Diosa
Diosa.

295
00:16:46,136 --> 00:16:49,031
听到了没 来Diosa
JUICE: You heard him? Diosa.

296
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:53,120
好 Clay有消息告诉我
JAX: All right, keep
me updated on Clay.

297
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:55,515
- 你和Juice去找那女孩
- 好
- You and Juice, find the girl.
CHIBS: - Yeah.

298
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:58,505
我们去会会 Dirty Charlie
JAX: And let's go
see Dirty Charlie.

299
00:16:58,711 --> 00:17:00,421
Hap 跟我们走
Hap, come with us.

300
00:17:12,127 --> 00:17:16,342
工资已经移到另一个账户了
LOWEN: Salaried income has been
shifted into a new account.

301
00:17:16,564 --> 00:17:18,055
很好
TARA: Good.

302
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:19,983
现金呢
LOWEN: What about the cash?

303
00:17:20,597 --> 00:17:22,413
保险箱在你们名下
Safety deposit box is
in both your names.

304
00:17:22,504 --> 00:17:24,037
现金是他的
TARA: Cash is his.

305
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:27,309
这些是为了离开他而不是赶走他
It's about getting away,
not cleaning him out.

306
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:32,721
这个是目击者名单
LOWEN: Here's a list of
character witnesses.

307
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,308
还能想起谁来吗
Anyone else you can think of?

308
00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:36,299
这单子真短
TARA: That's a short list.

309
00:17:38,611 --> 00:17:39,876
不要紧 可以的
No, it's fine.

310
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,879
我看了下医院记录
LOWEN: I looked over your medical
documentation--

311
00:17:51,263 --> 00:17:55,820
怀孕可能行 流产 医生签名
positive pregnancy, ultrasounds,
doctor's signatures...

312
00:17:56,591 --> 00:18:01,521
全是Margaret Murphy催促的
all expedited...
by Margaret Murphy.

313
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:11,055
用假的医疗记录来获取抚养权可是重罪
Using false medical records to
substantiate a custody hold is a felony.

314
00:18:11,151 --> 00:18:12,403
我知道
TARA: I know that.

315
00:18:12,494 --> 00:18:15,988
还有两周就要出庭了
LOWEN: We're two weeks away from
standing in front of a jury.

316
00:18:17,274 --> 00:18:22,250
如果你还在策划些别的事情 我现在需要知道
If there's any more drama you've
got planned, I need to know now.

317
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:26,867
我都告诉你了
TARA: You know everything.

318
00:18:27,928 --> 00:18:30,773
耶稣对信奉他的犹太人说
PREACHER: So Jesus said to the
Jews who believed Him,

319
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,226
如果你们遵守我的话 就是我真正的信徒
"If you abide in my Word, you
are truly my disciples.

320
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:37,908
你们会知道真理 真想让你们获得自由
You will know the truth and
this truth will set you free."

321
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:44,728
明白么 约翰他不是在说你们的真理
或者是我的真理
See, John-- he ain't talking
about your truth or my truth,

322
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:47,062
- 他说的是上帝的真理
- 阿门
- he's talking about God's truth.
INMATE: - Amen.

323
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:50,067
作为一般人 我们不知道真正的真理
PREACHER: As mortal men,
we can't know real truth.

324
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:53,289
为什么呢? 因为我们说谎吗
And why? Is it
because we are liars?

325
00:18:53,395 --> 00:18:57,257
因为我们邪恶或者不可信吗 不是
Is it because we are evil
or untrustworthy? No.

326
00:18:57,447 --> 00:19:00,945
我们有人类的真理 因为我们生来就有罪
We have the truth of man because
we were born with the sin of man!

327
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:05,342
兄弟们 是罪恶蒙蔽我们 不让我们
认识上帝和他的真理
It is sin, my brothers, that keeps
us from knowing God and His truth!

328
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:07,623
- 没错
- 罪恶
INMATE: - That's right.
PREACHER: - Sin!

329
00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:11,067
我们都带着这肮脏的眼镜
Those dirty glasses
that we all wear.

330
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:17,289
是我们所说的所做的都为自己着想
It is what makes everything we say,
everything we do, self-motivated!

331
00:19:17,826 --> 00:19:20,903
那么怎样才能了解上帝的真理
So how do we get to
know God and His truth?

332
00:19:21,016 --> 00:19:24,740
怎样克服自己的欲望
How do we see beyond our
own selfish desires?

333
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:27,961
怎样获取自由
How do we set ourselves free?

334
00:19:28,253 --> 00:19:29,396
上帝
Jesus.

335
00:19:29,497 --> 00:19:31,121
阿门 上帝
CLAY: Amen, Jesus.

336
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,425
阿门 上帝
Amen, Jesus!

337
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:37,292
(chuckles)

338
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,037
让我直说吧 神父
Let me get something
straight, Rev.

339
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:46,336
某个犹太人被定在了十字架上
Some Jew gets nailed to a
cross, like, uh, I don't know,

340
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:48,995
谁他妈知道在一千年之前 他就成了
a thousand who-gives-a-shit
years ago, and he's gonna

341
00:19:49,094 --> 00:19:55,525
能给我们这些人渣带来快乐和自由的良药?
be the magic pill that pulls all of
us scumbags to happiness and freedom?

342
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,503
是的 就是这样 我的兄弟
PREACHER: Yes, it
will, my brother.

343
00:19:58,603 --> 00:20:01,224
哇
(Clay chuckles) CLAY: Wow.

344
00:20:02,593 --> 00:20:04,322
哇
Wow!

345
00:20:04,658 --> 00:20:06,541
你知道上帝给我什么了吗
You know what God
gave me, brother?

346
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,350
你知道什么让我自由了吗
You know what sets me free?

347
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:11,837
逼（这段直翻了...)
Pussy.

348
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:13,367
(laughter)

349
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:16,864
甜蜜神圣的逼
Sweet, holy pussy.

350
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:21,425
知道吗 上帝制造男人只有三个理由
You see, God, He put man on
this planet for three reasons,

351
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:24,208
吃喝 战斗
eating... fighting...

352
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:26,685
还有 操翻紧实湿润的逼
and
tearing up tight, wet pussy!

353
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:27,708
够了 犯人
GUARD: That's enough, inmate!

354
00:20:27,788 --> 00:20:31,308
这个 这个擦干净了我的黑色眼睛 兄弟
CLAY: That... that is what cleans
my dark glasses, my brother.

355
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:32,881
闭嘴坐下 Clay
GUARD: Shut up and
sit down, Morrow.

356
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,171
我做不下来 上帝在我身体里
CLAY: I can't sit!
I got the Lord in me!

357
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,675
他想让我站着 想让我传道
He wants me up,
He wants me preaching,

358
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,632
他想让我传播信条
He wants me to spread the gospel...

359
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:44,336
逼是治愈者 逼是救世主
pussy the healer,
pussy the redeemer--

360
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:46,464
我能为了逼阿门吗
Can I get a "Amen" for pussy!

361
00:20:46,643 --> 00:20:48,302
走吧 快出去 混蛋
GUARD 2: Let's go. You're
out of here, asshole!

362
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:53,553
(clamoring, guard screaming)

363
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:56,234
(Clay spits)

364
00:20:56,362 --> 00:20:59,305
我现在闻到真理了 兄弟
CLAY: I "nose" the
truth now, brother!

365
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:00,614
(guard continues screaming)

366
00:21:00,705 --> 00:21:04,913
我自由了 香甜的逼给了我自由
I'm free. Sweet pussy
has set me free!

367
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:08,327
(cackling)

368
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:13,315
- 嗨
- 嗨
JAX: - Hey.
NERO: - Hey.

369
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:15,737
- 你回来了真好 兄弟
JAX: Glad you're back, brother.

370
00:21:15,836 --> 00:21:18,196
谢谢 兄弟 见到你真好
NERO: Thanks, mano.
Good to see you.

371
00:21:18,365 --> 00:21:20,657
我们知道那都是诬陷
BOBBY: We knew it
was all bullshit.

372
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:23,274
对 你们知道 正义胜过一切 对吧
NERO: Yeah, you know,
justice prevails, right?

373
00:21:24,126 --> 00:21:28,438
在Barosky过来捣乱之前我们要聊一下
We need to catch up before Barosky
comes over here, ruins our day.

374
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:33,146
- 家事
- 好 没问题
- Family thing.
JAX: - Yeah. Sure.

375
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:46,560
我希望是你家里的事
I'm hoping it's your family
you need to talk about.

376
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:49,318
Gemma 现在也是家里人了
NERO: Gemma is my
family now, mano.

377
00:21:50,497 --> 00:21:53,090
嗯 很好 因为我不管她了
JAX: Well, that's good, 'cause
I'm about done with her.

378
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,141
嗯 我看出来了
NERO: Yeah, I'm seeing that.

379
00:21:55,483 --> 00:21:59,921
听着 我 我知道这很糟
Look, I... I know
how bad this feels.

380
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:03,325
但是我觉得你应该回顾一下 再想想这件事
But I think that you should go back
take another look at what happened.

381
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:04,698
查查真相 Jax
Find the truth in
all of this, Jax.

382
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,076
我知道真相 Nero
JAX: I already know
the truth, Nero!

383
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:08,777
- 不 不
- 什么
NERO: - No... no...
JAX: - What?

384
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:11,153
- 你说我老婆骗人
- 哇哦
- You think my wife is a liar?
NERO: - Whoa!

385
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:13,969
我是说 事情比你想的要复杂
I'm just saying it's a lot more
complicated, bro, than you...

386
00:22:14,056 --> 00:22:15,247
听着 我明白了
JAX: Look, I get it.

387
00:22:15,346 --> 00:22:17,418
你爱上我老妈了 你为她说话
You're in love with my mom,
you're staying in her corner,

388
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:19,205
这是你的自由
that's your choice.

389
00:22:20,218 --> 00:22:22,038
但是如果我们之间还做生意
But if we're going to keep doing
business together,

390
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:26,740
我和我家里的破事不归你管
the shit that went down between
me and my family is off-limits.

391
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,190
你明白吗
Do you understand?

392
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:30,929
以后别再和我谈起这件事
This conversation
doesn't happen again.

393
00:22:31,025 --> 00:22:32,121
和别人也不行
With anyone.

394
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:33,070
Jax
NERO: Jax...

395
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:37,449
老大 Charlie和火辣女士来了
HAPPY: Boss... Charlie
and the MILF madame are here.

396
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:38,596
好
JAX: All right.

397
00:22:41,174 --> 00:22:42,686
去吧 合伙人
NERO: Let's go, partner.

398
00:22:56,258 --> 00:22:58,323
- 你见过Bobby了
- 是的
JAX: - I see you met Bobby.
COLETTE: - Yes.

399
00:22:58,433 --> 00:22:59,586
很高兴你带顾问来了
BAROSKY: Glad you
brought the think tank.

400
00:22:59,657 --> 00:23:01,793
你或许需要他们 你来付保释金?
We may need them.
You pull bail?

401
00:23:01,884 --> 00:23:03,903
他们没证据 只能让我走了
NERO: They had nothing.
Had to let me go.

402
00:23:04,025 --> 00:23:04,758
你真够幸运的
BAROSKY: Good for you.

403
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,580
你自由了我被关禁闭了
While you were getting freed
up, I was getting shut down.

404
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:12,342
来自区检察官的暴力指控
Health violations, compliments
of our district attorney.

405
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:15,687
我以为你会用受害人老爸的自杀作为筹码
JAX: I thought you were gonna use
the victim's dad fubar as leverage.

406
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:17,452
那个死婊子通过别的事找我们麻烦
BAROSKY: That pitch bitch is
coming at us sideways,

407
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:19,758
还有我证明不了那人的死和她有关
and I can't prove she had
anything to do with that.

408
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:23,618
我们没通过护送服务
COLETTE: We didn't make the
escort rating, either-- denied.

409
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,500
不明原因
Unspecified reasons.

410
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:28,165
没有Diosa分部了
No Diosa Del Sur.

411
00:23:28,268 --> 00:23:29,878
该死
JAX: Goddamn.

412
00:23:29,998 --> 00:23:32,143
她想让你为学校枪击负责 兄弟
BAROSKY: She wants you for
that school shooting, man.

413
00:23:32,235 --> 00:23:35,253
她还会死盯着和你一起的人
And she's gonna continue to
strangle everybody in bed with you.

414
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:38,107
听着 孩子 我不是奸细也不是圣人
Now, listen, kid, I ain't no rat
but I ain't no martyr, either.

415
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,709
(Jax sighs)

416
00:23:39,864 --> 00:23:42,175
- 我会有办法的
- 什么办法 Jax
JAX: - I'll figure it out.
COLETTE: - How, Jax?

417
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,662
听着 Patterson她绝望了 她没证据
NERO: Look, Patterson-- she's
desperate; she got nothing.

418
00:23:44,893 --> 00:23:47,967
她会撤销这些玩意儿 我们只要等着就行
She's gonna move off of all this shit.
We just got to wait it out.

419
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,975
对 你们必须等 但要在Stockton外面
BAROSKY: No, you got to wait.
Out of Stockton.

420
00:23:52,086 --> 00:23:54,505
对不起 但是这个我承受不起 我撤了
I'm sorry, but I can't take the hit.
I got to eject.

421
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,995
代我向帅脸Jack和帮会说再见
Say so long to Handsome
Jack and the biker brigade.

422
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:00,507
别这样 Charlie Nero说得对
JAX: Come on, Charlie.
Nero's right.

423
00:24:00,903 --> 00:24:03,539
这就是Patterson想要的
This is exactly what
Patterson wants--

424
00:24:03,646 --> 00:24:05,412
想伤害我们 因为她没证据
to hurt us 'cause she's got no case.

425
00:24:05,532 --> 00:24:08,725
我知道 孩子 我知道 但现在这也是我想要的
BAROSKY: I know, kid, I know.
But right now, it's what I want, too.

426
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,430
听着 对不起
Now, look, I'm sorry.

427
00:24:11,261 --> 00:24:13,272
世道有变 告诉我
Things change, you let me know.

428
00:24:13,372 --> 00:24:14,517
走吧
Let's go.

429
00:24:19,814 --> 00:24:21,449
(door opens)

430
00:24:31,397 --> 00:24:32,594
(door closes)

431
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,542
我不知道他在这
GEMMA: Didn't know he
was gonna be here.

432
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,077
老妈 我们也许应该去摄影棚
NERO: Mama, maybe we
should go into the studio...

433
00:24:42,194 --> 00:24:44,369
没事 我要走了
JAX: Don't bother. I'm leaving.

434
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,538
只是别让他干你的脏活
Just don't send him to
do your dirty work.

435
00:24:46,632 --> 00:24:48,111
没人让我做任何事
NERO: Nobody sent
me to do anything.

436
00:24:48,214 --> 00:24:49,822
我只是想帮忙
I was just trying to help.

437
00:24:49,925 --> 00:24:51,492
别对他发火
GEMMA: Don't take it out on him.

438
00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:54,569
好 我觉得他更了解了
JAX: Yeah, well, I think
he knows better now.

439
00:24:55,111 --> 00:24:56,754
真可惜你不了解
GEMMA: Too bad you don't.

440
00:24:57,318 --> 00:25:00,107
你知道他为了你和帮会做了什么吗
You have any idea what he just
did for you and the club?

441
00:25:00,192 --> 00:25:01,690
- Gem Gem
- 别 别 别
NERO: - Gem, Gem...
GEMMA: - No, no, no.

442
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,100
他得知道
He needs to know.

443
00:25:05,485 --> 00:25:06,871
什么？
JAX: What?

444
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:10,239
检察官想让他把你交代出来
GEMMA: DA wanted
him to give you up.

445
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:12,572
他不愿意
He wouldn't.

446
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:16,028
但是他知道那个婊子不会罢休
But he also knew that that
bitch would keep coming.

447
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:20,537
所以他供出自己是枪的来源
So he gave himself up
as the gun source.

448
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:26,166
- 这是真的
- 你知道 这不要紧
JAX: - Is that true?
NERO: - Hey, you know, it-it didn't matter.

449
00:25:26,264 --> 00:25:28,544
我正要做这笔交易的时候 我的律师
By the time I was gonna make
this deal, my lawyer found out

450
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:31,335
发现了警长们从Toric的房间里取得证据
that the sheriffs, they had
pulled evidence from Toric's

451
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:34,683
证实了是他杀的Erin
hotel room, proved that he was
the one that killed Erin.

452
00:25:35,698 --> 00:25:37,993
所以Patterson放我走了
So, Patterson, she
had to let me go.

453
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,158
我不知道她咬的你这么紧
JAX: I didn't realize she
was bending you like that.

454
00:25:44,267 --> 00:25:45,651
对 好吧
NERO: Yeah, well...

455
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:50,970
她不见血不罢休
she, uh, ain't gonna stop
until she draws blood, man.

456
00:25:52,568 --> 00:25:54,098
是啊
JAX: Yeah.

457
00:25:59,711 --> 00:26:00,968
好了 宝贝
NERO: Come on, babe.

458
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:11,319
你没事吧
BOBBY: You all right?

459
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,965
有些事
JAX: No, not really.

460
00:26:21,374 --> 00:26:23,132
Nero说得对
Nero's right.

461
00:26:24,857 --> 00:26:27,150
Patterson不会就此罢休
Patterson ain't gonna stop.

462
00:26:29,553 --> 00:26:32,737
召集大家开堂会
Call everyone. Chapel.

463
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,224
我们要投票
We need to take a vote.

464
00:26:36,264 --> 00:26:40,076
嗨 我找到Putner的地址了 兄弟
TIG: Hey. We got an
address for Putner, man.

465
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:41,128

It's actually a few
blocks from here.

466
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:44,146
- 在Willow Gulch
- 好 我们走

JAX: - All right, let's go.

467
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:47,330

TIG: All right.
All right, come on.

468
00:26:55,097 --> 00:26:56,845
(knocking)

469
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,478
(small dog barks)

470
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:05,338
- 你是Putner

GARY: Me, too. Heard
about what happened.

473
00:27:12,653 --> 00:27:15,445
- 你是追她的那个人？
- 是的
- You the one who chased her?
JAX: - Yeah.

474
00:27:16,154 --> 00:27:17,770
我没伤害她
I didn't hurt her.

475
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:20,035
我只是想知道答案
I just want some answers.

476
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:22,162
我明白 进来吧

478
00:27:35,957 --> 00:27:38,696
焦虑 两极性格
Anxiety, bipolar.

479
00:27:38,914 --> 00:27:40,600
他妈妈也这样
Her mom had it, too.

480
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:44,826
你知道我是谁吗
JAX: Do you know who I am?

481
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,596
知道
GARY: Yeah.

482
00:27:48,596 --> 00:27:50,878
你觉得这是他袭击我们的原因吗
JAX: Is that why she
attacked us, do you think?

483
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:53,025
因为我老爸
Because of my dad?

484
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,427
这周很艰难
GARY: Been a rough week.

485
00:27:59,756 --> 00:28:01,626
我的房子没了
I lost the house.

486
00:28:02,744 --> 00:28:04,575
我们在打包东西
We've been packing shit up.

487
00:28:05,608 --> 00:28:08,319
发现了很多他妈妈的照片

photos of her mom.

488
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:12,765
在报纸上看到她死了的新闻
Found the newspaper
article about her death.

489
00:28:13,544 --> 00:28:17,950
起初她以为是你爸引起的连带伤害杀死了她妈
First time she realized your dad
caused the pileup that killed her mom.

490
00:28:19,762 --> 00:28:22,959
我猜 在她混乱的小脑袋里 他怪罪你们
I guess, in her messy little
brain, she blames you guys.

491
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,231
对不起
I'm sorry.

492
00:28:25,362 --> 00:28:26,963

怎么了
Why?

496
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,615
她看起来眼熟
JAX: She looks familiar.

497
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,868
我知道 我之前也这样
GARY: I know.
Happens to me, too.

498
00:28:44,537 --> 00:28:48,525
看别人像他
I see her a lot...
in other people.

499
00:28:53,882 --> 00:28:56,571
那你知道你的孩子可能在哪吗
JAX: So you got any idea
where your kid might be?

500
00:28:56,822 --> 00:28:57,807
我不清楚
GARY: I don't know.

501
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,426
即便她一般都会回家
She always comes home, though.

502
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:02,107
我会找她谈出个端倪
I'll talk to her and
straighten this out.

504
00:29:05,406 --> 00:29:06,705
我会赔偿你们的损失
GARY: We'll pay for the damage.

505
00:29:06,814 --> 00:29:08,786

506
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:10,976
谢谢
GARY: Thank you.

507
00:29:13,706 --> 00:29:14,735

00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:52,639
你在找Jax
You looking for Jax?

515
00:29:52,748 --> 00:29:56,253
不 其实 我想和你谈谈
NERO: No. I was, uh, hoping
I could talk to you.

516
00:29:57,469 --> 00:29:58,746
当然好
TARA: Sure.

517
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,262
这个是因为天生的缺陷
NERO: Is that for his,
uh, birth defect?

518
00:30:03,363 --> 00:30:06,103
是的 心律不齐
TARA: Yeah. Heart arrhythmia.

519
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:08,014
看起来对他们什么影响
NERO: Doesn't seem
to slow him down.

520
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:10,098
是的 没影响
TARA: No, it doesn't.

521
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:13,113
你怎么样
NERO: How are you feeling?

522
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,663
还行
TARA: Fine.

523
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:22,348
我想你来这不是为了看看我家里人的健康问题
I'm assuming you're not just here to
check on the health of my family.

524
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:24,624
其实我是的
NERO: Actually, I am.

525

情绪健康
Emotional health.

526
00:30:28,132 --> 00:30:30,237
嗯 我们在努力度过这段时期
TARA: Well, we're all
getting through it.

527
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,274
不是所有人
NERO: Not everyone.

528
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:40,498
医生 你不把我当做一个恶人
Doc, you know, you don't strike me
as being a malicious kind of person.

529
00:30:40,612 --> 00:30:42,619
我确信无论你和Gemma之间发生什么
I'm sure whatever it was that
happened between you and

530
00:30:42,771 --> 00:30:45,833
你做了你认为对的事情
Gemma, you did what you
thought was right.

531
00:30:45,942 --> 00:30:48,859
Gemma袭击了我 导致了流产
TARA: Gemma attacked me.
Caused a miscarriage.

532
00:30:48,966 --> 00:30:55,297
没错 我想我在请求你能不能换个角度想想
NERO: Right. I guess I'm asking if you could
take another look at what's been done.

533
00:30:55,644 --> 00:30:57,585
你们的家庭正在分裂
The rip it's causing
in your family.

534
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,672
你没资格将我的家庭 你不了解我
TARA: You don't get to weigh in
on my family. You don't know me.

535
00:31:01,773 --> 00:31:04,325
对 我不了解 但是我了解Gemma 你也是
NERO: No, I don't, but I do
know Gemma and so do you.

536
00:31:04,498 --> 00:31:08,500
她不会就这样放手
She's not gonna lay
down for this.

537
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:13,562
也许我们能找个双方妥协的办法
Maybe we could find some
kind of middle ground here.

538
00:31:13,676 --> 00:31:17,880
因为 如果不这样 对双方都不好
'Cause if not... this is not
gonna end up well for anyone.

539
00:31:17,985 --> 00:31:21,630
包括你 你知道和他在一起的男人都什么下场
TARA: Including you. You see what
happens to the men she's with.

540
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:23,532
一个丈夫死了 一个在监狱
One husband dead,
another in jail.

541
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,795
是的 你知道 这就是生活（越狱名言）
NERO: Yeah, well, you
know, that's the life.

542
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:28,553
不对 这是因为那个女人 她杀了John Teller
TARA: No, it's the wife!
She killed John Teller!

543
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:31,880
也许同样会对Clay下手
Probably would've done
the same to Clay.

544
00:31:31,992 --> 00:31:33,470
你想有个好结果
You want it to end well?

545
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:37,610
我建议你在你死之前抽身
I suggest you get out now
before you end up dead, too.

546
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,599
(door opens)

547
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:54,339
他就是那个在教堂里捣乱的人
TROUT: Is he the one who
flipped out in the chapel?

548
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,580
是的 医生 他现在稳定了 没事
ORDERLY: Yeah, Doc.
He's calm now. He's secure.

549
00:31:57,689 --> 00:32:01,541
好的 交给我吧 你去6号房帮帮Nance
TROUT: Okay. I got it.
Go help Nance in six.

550
00:32:01,648 --> 00:32:03,479
Tanner还有出戏要演
Tanner had another episode.

551
00:32:03,591 --> 00:32:05,392
该死 好的吧
ORDERLY: Shit. Yeah, okay.

552
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,667
(orderly sighs)

553
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:11,356
(door closes)

554
00:32:11,688 --> 00:32:12,281
(lock clicks)

555
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,191
- 你是Morrow
- 是的
TROUT: - You Morrow?
CLAY: - Yeah.

556
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:24,532
在下次探班之前你有40分钟时间
TROUT: You got 40 minutes
till the next rotation.

557
00:32:28,735 --> 00:32:34,450
你要是被抓了还把我供出来 我会把你拉到这来捆了你
You get caught, you give me up,
I'll pull you in here, strap you down,

558
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:38,102
用三倍量的氯丙嗪炸了你的脑子
fry your brain with a
triple dose of Thorazine.

559
00:32:38,985 --> 00:32:41,518
Hippocratic誓言里面有这句话?
（Hippocratic oath是外国医生上岗前的宣誓誓言）
CLAY: What part of the
Hippocratic oath is that?

560
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:44,395
如果你的爱尔兰猪朋友不付
足够我退休的钱
TROUT: Same part that says
your mick friends don't pay

561
00:32:44,508 --> 00:32:46,747
一样炸了你
enough for me to take a fall.

562
00:32:58,398 --> 00:32:59,360
(door closes)

563
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:00,662
(lock clicks)

564
00:33:04,264 --> 00:33:07,661
(dialing)

565
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:09,156
(elevator bell dings)

566
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:17,599
Murphy女士 Knowles医生10分钟前找你
NURSE: Ms. Murphy, from
Dr. Knowles, ten minutes ago.

567
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:19,144
谢谢
MARGARET: Thank you.

568
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:31,749
Tara
Tara?

569
00:33:32,457 --> 00:33:33,642
(gasps)

570
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:35,079
她回家了
GEMMA: She went home.

571
00:33:35,586 --> 00:33:37,790
我立马就能交保安来
MARGARET: I can have
security here in an instant.

572
00:33:38,287 --> 00:33:39,391
没必要
GEMMA: No need.

573
00:33:40,156 --> 00:33:42,372
我们谈谈接下来的事情
I debated how to do this.

574
00:33:43,877 --> 00:33:48,187
在我看来 你对我做的事情
The way I feel...
what you did to me...

575
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:53,851
我完全可以拧开你苍白的嗓子
I could squeeze the swallow out
of that pale white throat.

576
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:59,942
但是 那只会增加你的正义感
But that would just give you a
greater sense of righteousness.

577
00:34:01,464 --> 00:34:04,113
所以我不会那样做
So let me tell you
what's gonna happen now.

578
00:34:04,996 --> 00:34:08,323
我会拿着记录Tara怀孕流产的
I'm gonna take those medical
records documenting Tara's

579
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,262
医药档案
pregnancy and her miscarriage,

580
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:14,908
然后交给医院董事会
and I'll present them
to the hospital board.

581
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:19,844
让他们知道你这个新生的主管是个骗子
Let them know that their Neonatal
administrator is a bit of a grifter.

582
00:34:20,111 --> 00:34:22,798
那样的话是我的证词对你的证词
MARGARET: It would be
my word against yours.

583
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,797
我就想知道这么多
GEMMA: That's all I
needed to know.

584
00:34:26,026 --> 00:34:27,432
谢谢你 红发妹
Thanks, Red.

585
00:34:28,006 --> 00:34:29,507
你什么意思
MARGARET: What does that mean?

586
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,860
意思是如果怀孕是真的你就会说
GEMMA: It means if the pregnancy was
legit, you would've told me that

587
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:38,024
这些文档是真的 还会说我疯了
those documents were real
and called me crazy.

588
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:43,711
- 你证明不了什么
- 哦 我不需要证明
MARGARET: - You can't prove anything.
GEMMA: - Oh, I don't need to prove it.

589
00:34:43,843 --> 00:34:48,094
我只是需要一个比吸毒者更可靠的来源来告诉我儿子
I just needed a more reliable source
than a junkie to share with my son.

590
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,806
他会证明的
He's gonna be the
one to prove it.

591
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:55,979
等他证明了 我马上告诉你 红发妹
And when he does, I'll tell
you right now, Red...

592
00:34:57,258 --> 00:35:02,727
那时候就没有保安能保证你安全了
there won't be enough security
in this state to keep you safe.

593
00:35:05,905 --> 00:35:08,495
(door opens, closes)

594
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,556
同意
JUICE: Yea.

595
00:35:14,193 --> 00:35:17,403
Proxied West和Montez都同意
QUINN: Proxied West and
Montez, they're a yea.

596
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,454
同意
BOBBY: Yea.

597
00:35:20,644 --> 00:35:21,618
同意
RAT BOY: Yea.

598
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,785
同意
TIG: Yea.

599
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:27,240
同意
HAPPY: Yea.

600
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:28,876
好的
JAX: All right.

601
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:32,372
我会去提这个条件
I'll go make the offer.

602
00:35:41,164 --> 00:35:42,711
把他带进来
PATTERSON: Send him in.

603
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:57,885
请坐
Have a seat.
(door closes)

604
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:12,857
我得说我很惊讶你会坐在我对面
I must say, I'm rather surprised
to see you sitting across from me.

605
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:16,040
我比你还惊讶
JAX: No more
surprised than I am.

606
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:18,256
你来干嘛
PATTERSON: So why are you here?

607
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,645
(Jax sighs)

608
00:36:20,794 --> 00:36:26,648
我的父亲 John Teller创办了混乱之子
JAX: Sons of Anarchy was started
by my father, John Teller.

609
00:36:27,214 --> 00:36:30,195
他一直希望有一个合法的帮会
He always wanted a
legitimate club.

610
00:36:30,385 --> 00:36:32,133
以死来追求
Died pursuing that.

611
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:34,061
我没兴趣听历史课
PATTERSON: I'm not in a
mood for a history lesson.

612
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:36,506
你为什么不说重点 Teller先生
Why don't you get
to it, Mr. Teller.

613
00:36:38,097 --> 00:36:40,738
我来这是为了给你一个条件
JAX: I'm here to
make you an offer.

614
00:36:41,393 --> 00:36:43,797
给我
PATTERSON: To make me...
(laughs)

615
00:36:43,894 --> 00:36:46,067
哇
Wow.

616
00:36:48,022 --> 00:36:51,602
你真有种 小子
You really have some balls, kid.

617
00:36:52,063 --> 00:36:56,612
我还有卖KG-9的爱尔兰人
JAX: I also have an
Irishman who sells KG-9s.

618
00:36:58,609 --> 00:37:00,200
爱尔兰共和军
PATTERSON: IRA?

619
00:37:00,322 --> 00:37:02,315
真-爱尔兰共和军
JAX: Real IRA.

620
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:06,703
爱尔兰天主革命的现任国王们
Current kings of the Irish
Catholic revolution.

621
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:11,320
那你能给我什么
PATTERSON: So what
are you offering?

622
00:37:13,093 --> 00:37:15,002
Gaalan O'Shay
JAX: Gaalan O'Shay.

623
00:37:15,893 --> 00:37:17,297
你可以让联邦调查局查一下
You can check with the feds.

624
00:37:17,406 --> 00:37:18,979
他是条大鱼
He's a big win.

625
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:23,086
我会把他和一次运的枪都给你
I will deliver him with
a shipment of guns.

626
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,007
一次性
Open and shut.

627
00:37:26,808 --> 00:37:32,408
那么你什么时候如何给我这条大鱼
PATTERSON: And when and how would
you deliver this "big win"?

628
00:37:32,923 --> 00:37:35,143
10天之内
JAX: It'll happen in
the next ten days.

629
00:37:36,853 --> 00:37:39,188
如何是我管的事情
The "how" is my job.

630
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,373
这提议真大胆
PATTERSON: It's a very
bold proposition.

631
00:37:45,169 --> 00:37:47,903
那你告诉我你的好处
So why don't you tell me
what's in it for you.

632
00:37:48,211 --> 00:37:53,283
帮会对于枪支指控的豁免权
JAX: Immunity for the
MC for all gun charges.

633
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:55,575
过去和现在的
Past and present.

634
00:37:58,115 --> 00:38:01,069
我想要一个合法的帮会
I want a legitimate club.

635
00:38:01,298 --> 00:38:04,999
有人想攻击我们并且毁了我们生意伙伴的话可没法实现
That can't happen while people
try to crush us, ruining all of

636
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,981
的话可没法实现
our business relationships.

637
00:38:09,647 --> 00:38:11,931
在Stockton放我们一马
Let us breathe in Stockton.

638
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:17,955
我们不会犯法而且不再有暴力
We won't break the law
and the violence stops.

639
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:24,186
就这些
PATTERSON: That's it?

640
00:38:24,777 --> 00:38:28,835
如果你觉得你能给我爱尔兰共和军
If you thought you could
deliver the IRA,

641
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:34,883
那我觉得你应该有个私人请求
then I figure you would at least
also have a personal request.

642
00:38:35,172 --> 00:38:36,913
我有
JAX: I do.

643
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:40,907
你要重新看一下Tara的案子
You need to look at
Tara's case again.

644
00:38:42,175 --> 00:38:47,566
是Toric制造了不存在的案件
Toric was the one connecting
the dots that didn't exist.

645
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:54,003
Tara不知道Otto会对那个护士做什么
Tara had no idea what Otto
was gonna do to that nurse.

646
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,521
我们都明白这点
We both know that.

647
00:38:57,712 --> 00:39:01,474
我知道的和我能证明的大不一样
PATTERSON: What I know and what I
can prove rarely come together.

648
00:39:01,581 --> 00:39:02,893
那么
So...

649
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:10,104
我应该相信你能办到这些
I'm supposed to expedite all
of these things on good faith?

650
00:39:10,561 --> 00:39:12,157
假设这都是真的
Just assume it's all real?

651
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,919
你不需要相信我
JAX: You don't need faith.

652
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,433
做好准备就行了
Just have everything ready to go,

653
00:39:15,543 --> 00:39:18,427
然后给我们点空间行动
and give us the space
to put it in motion.

654
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:24,036
如果爱尔兰人认为我们被跟踪了 就全完了
If the Irish think we're being
tailed, this whole thing implodes.

655
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,932
我告诉你Gaalan和枪在哪
I'll tell you where to
find Gaalan and the guns.

656
00:39:29,459 --> 00:39:32,430
然你和你团伙就溜走了
PATTERSON: And you and your
crew, you just skate away

657
00:39:32,523 --> 00:39:34,988
不受到一点牵连
without so much as a
slap on the wrist?

658
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,338
等到他们完蛋的时候你也可以牵连我们
JAX: You can slap my wrists
until they're bloody, lady.

659
00:39:37,444 --> 00:39:39,294
我他妈才不关心这个
I don't give a shit.

660
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:43,795
我再给你一个与你的薪水不相符的机会
I'm giving you a win well
above your pay grade.

661
00:39:44,372 --> 00:39:48,426
你带着你的罪恶感别趟这滩浑水
You get your devil and you punch
your ticket out of this cesspool.

662
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:52,070
你留着你的正义感
So let's not get too
lost in righteousness.

663
00:39:54,675 --> 00:40:00,347
我是不守法的人渣 你是正义的支柱
I'm the scumbag outlaw, and
you're the pillar of justice.

664
00:40:01,092 --> 00:40:05,085
而且我们都不想在镜子里看到对方
And neither one of us likes looking
at ourselves in the mirror.

Do we have a deal?

666
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,615

(Unser chattering)

674
00:41:02,451 --> 00:41:04,447

We're having a fire sale.

680
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:34,309

OSWALD: - What're you gonna do?

682
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:40,374
看看保险能给多少
JAX: Waiting for the insurance
to come up with a number.

683
00:41:41,397 --> 00:41:44,918
很明显C-4不在保单上
Apparently we didn't
have C-4 coverage.

684
00:41:46,576 --> 00:41:48,261
你需要什么吗
OSWALD: What do you need?

685
00:41:48,435 --> 00:41:50,858
我们不用你的仓库了
JAX: We're done with
your lumber warehouse.

686
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,939
不做军火生意了
Moving out of guns.

687

他的房子要没了

我希望你能帮帮他
I'd like it if you
could help him.

696
00:42:18,024 --> 00:42:21,331
我是他老板不是他慈祥的教母
OSWALD: I'm his employer,
not his fairy godmother.

697
00:42:21,431 --> 00:42:25,512
别这样 Oswald 你有个货代公司
JAX: Come on, Oswald, you got a

别让这个人连家都没有
Don't let the guy
lose his home.

我会帮他但是我们现在麻烦一堆
I'd help him, but we're tapped.

700
00:42:32,187 --> 00:42:34,403
你为什么关心这个
OSWALD: Why's this
so important to you?

701
00:42:36,864 --> 00:42:38,545
不知道
JAX: I don't know.

702
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,082
这样 我欠你一个人情
Hey, I'll owe you one.

703

00:49:52,169 --> 00:49:54,812
(crickets chirping)

804
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:17,159
知道你需要的事情了
UNSER: You get what you needed?

805
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:19,957
(car door closes)

806
00:50:20,074 --> 00:50:21,636
嗯
JAX: Yeah.

807
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,987
(engine starts)

808
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:26,895
你保证过的 孩子
UNSER: You made me
a promise, son.

809
00:50:27,385 --> 00:50:29,092
没人受伤
Nobody gets hurt.

810
00:50:31,601 --> 00:50:33,342
我知道
JAX: Yeah.

811
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,505
(car drives away)

812
00:50:35,604 --> 00:50:37,550
Nobody gets hurt.

813
00:50:43,337 --> 00:50:45,033
(dialing)

814
00:50:45,523 --> 00:50:47,626
(line ringing)

815
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:52,096
(phone ringing)

816
00:50:53,274 --> 00:50:54,288
你好
TARA: Hello.

817
00:50:54,382 --> 00:50:57,605
Tara 我是Ally Lowen
LOWEN: Tara, it's Ally Lowen.

818
00:50:59,995 --> 00:51:01,513
你为什么去找Tara
GEMMA: Why'd you go to Tara?

819
00:51:01,644 --> 00:51:03,798
我不想这样
It's not what I wanted.

820
00:51:04,336 --> 00:51:05,888
我不知道
NERO: I don't know.

821
00:51:07,303 --> 00:51:12,147
我认为如果她知道她现在造成的伤害
I thought maybe if she knew all the
damage that was being done...

822
00:51:13,201 --> 00:51:15,383
看来事与愿违了
GEMMA: I guess that backfired.

823
00:51:16,334 --> 00:51:17,784
是啊
NERO: Yeah.

824
00:51:25,186 --> 00:51:27,664
她说了些你的事情
She had some things
to say about you.

825
00:51:28,087 --> 00:51:29,906
她当然会说
GEMMA: I'm sure she did.

826
00:51:32,254 --> 00:51:34,205
关于John的事情
NERO: About John.

827
00:51:43,773 --> 00:51:45,701
她说什么了
GEMMA: What'd she tell you?

828
00:51:47,259 --> 00:51:49,059
你杀了他
NERO: That you killed him.

829
00:51:52,271 --> 00:51:53,966
是真的吗
Any truth to that?

830
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:00,466
(Gemma sighs)

831
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:21,448
John试着让帮会脱离军火交易
GEMMA: John was trying to
get the club out of guns.

832
00:52:23,546 --> 00:52:26,065
当时就想现在这么紧张
It was as tense
then as it is now.

833
00:52:26,515 --> 00:52:30,354
他去了Belfast好几次
He was making trips
back and forth to Belfast,

834
00:52:30,453 --> 00:52:32,696
想和爱尔兰人和解
trying to make it
right with the Irish.

835
00:52:36,411 --> 00:52:38,866
然后他爱上了一个人
He fell in love with someone.

836
00:52:40,892 --> 00:52:42,926
Maureen Ashby.
Maureen Ashby.

837
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:47,266
他哥哥是个牧师 John的朋友
Brother was a priest,
friend of John's,

838
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:52,928
帮助他与爱尔兰共和军和解
helping broker a peaceful
transition with the IRA.

839
00:52:57,094 --> 00:52:58,883
我发现了
I found out.

840
00:53:01,143 --> 00:53:03,661
开始和Clay在一起
Started spending time with Clay.

841
00:53:08,027 --> 00:53:12,697
我的Thomas死的时候John不在身边
My Thomas died when John was
away on one of those trips.

842
00:53:13,603 --> 00:53:17,119
所以他回来的时候我不是太友好
And I wasn't kind
when he got home.

843
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:24,561
失去孩子的痛苦和愤怒都发泄在他身上
The pain and anger of losing my
baby, I made sure it landed on him.

844
00:53:25,397 --> 00:53:29,567
他崩溃了
He came undone after that.

845
00:53:31,025 --> 00:53:33,477
和爱尔兰共和军的谈判也瓦解了
Talks with the IRA fell apart.

846
00:53:33,762 --> 00:53:36,453
Clay和McGee重新揽起了生意
Clay and McGee put them
back together again.

847
00:53:36,597 --> 00:53:38,366
另一方面
In the other direction.

848
00:53:38,457 --> 00:53:40,947
为帮会稳固了军火交易
Solidified the gun
trade for the club.

849
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:42,548
使他们开始掌权
Made them players.

850
00:53:44,472 --> 00:53:46,060
但是JT
But JT...

851
00:53:47,652 --> 00:53:49,381
他开始写
he started writing in this...

852
00:53:49,797 --> 00:53:53,779
日记 手稿
this journal, a manuscript.

853
00:53:54,387 --> 00:53:56,386
那是血淋漓的忏悔
It was a bleeding confession,

854
00:53:56,488 --> 00:53:58,239
质疑他所有的决定
questioning all his choices,

855
00:53:58,328 --> 00:54:02,126
后悔他为SAMCRO做的一切
regretting everything
he'd ever done in SAMCRO.

856
00:54:04,311 --> 00:54:06,895
他不再关心帮会
He stopped caring
about the club.

857
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:09,885
他的家庭
About his family.

858
00:54:12,136 --> 00:54:14,854
而且那时很危险
And it was a
dangerous time here.

859
00:54:15,602 --> 00:54:17,329
与Mayan的战争
Mayan war.

860
00:54:17,798 --> 00:54:20,820
两帮调查局对帮会紧追不舍
Feds infiltrating MCs.

861
00:54:22,348 --> 00:54:24,285
所有人都害怕了
Everyone was scared.

862
00:54:29,207 --> 00:54:31,992
JT是最弱的一环节
JT was a weak link.

863
00:54:47,221 --> 00:54:49,218
你没回答我的问题
NERO: You didn't
answer my question.

864
00:54:52,398 --> 00:54:54,532
我没杀他
GEMMA: I didn't kill him.

865
00:54:55,903 --> 00:54:58,406
但是我知道他必须死
But I knew it had to be done.

866
00:54:59,609 --> 00:55:03,562
就像你知道Arcadio必须死一样
The same way you knew it had
to be done with Arcadio.

867
00:55:05,518 --> 00:55:07,969
我们以这个原则判定生死
We live and die by that code.

868
00:55:09,069 --> 00:55:12,160
现在我知道 当时我也知道
I know it now, and
I knew it then.

869
00:55:12,255 --> 00:55:17,326
而且我没有对我爱的男人隐瞒观点
And I did not hide my opinion from
the man I'd fallen in love with.

870
00:55:21,978 --> 00:55:26,138
我赞成Clay杀死John Teller
I gave my blessing for
Clay to kill John Teller.

871
00:55:36,161 --> 00:55:38,306
我没对任何人讲过这件事
I've never told that to anyone.

872
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,222
包括我儿子
Including my son.

873
00:55:58,686 --> 00:56:00,354
(engine stops)

874
00:56:07,779 --> 00:56:09,437
(electronic doorbell chimes)

875
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:18,784
天哪 Jackie 你没事吧
CHIBS: Jesus Christ, Jackie.
You okay?

876
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,181
我没事
JAX: I'm all right.

877
00:56:21,895 --> 00:56:23,336
你的小女朋友来了
CHIBS: Your little
girlfriend's here.

878
00:56:23,432 --> 00:56:24,983
想说说话
Wants to talk.

879
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:27,100
拿扳手的那个
JAX: Girl with the wrench?

880
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:30,064
对 她还没说什么
BOBBY: Yeah. She
hasn't said much.

881
00:56:30,155 --> 00:56:31,991
除了说她要见你
Except that she
needs to see you.

882
00:56:32,572 --> 00:56:34,589
让我单独和她谈谈
JAX: Let me talk to her alone.

883
00:56:35,703 --> 00:56:37,580
她没带武器
BOBBY: She ain't packing.

884
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:42,875
走
Go.

885
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:45,121
好吧 起立 到楼上去
CHIBS: All right, get up.
Upstairs.

886
00:56:45,386 --> 00:56:46,879
你也来 笛子先生
You, too, Mr. Kazoo.

887
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:49,100
(Chuck playing kazoo)

888
00:57:00,904 --> 00:57:03,526
那个吹笛子的人真有意思
BROOKE: Guy with the kazoo's
pretty interesting.

889
00:57:03,835 --> 00:57:06,826
我们在门前了篮子里找到他的
JAX: We found him in a
basket on our doorstep.

890
00:57:08,976 --> 00:57:10,592
他怎么了
BROOKE: What happened?

891
00:57:12,522 --> 00:57:14,973
被扳手打的
JAX: Got hit with a pipe wrench.

892
00:57:16,084 --> 00:57:17,523
好吧 对
BROOKE: Yeah, I'm...

893
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:20,412
对不起砸了你的窗户

还有车

895
00:57:24,651 --> 00:57:26,675
我和你爸爸谈过了
JAX: I talked to your dad.

896
00:57:27,658 --> 00:57:28,887
我知道
BROOKE: I know.

897
00:57:32,273 --> 00:57:33,157
我

898
00:57:33,268 --> 00:57:36,017
我不太清楚发生了什么
I'm not really
sure what happened.

899
00:57:37,102 --> 00:57:38,740
我是说 我看到那篇报道
I mean, I-I found the article,

900
00:57:38,848 --> 00:57:42,358
然后我知道你们搬到这来了

guys moved in here.

901
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,465
我有些
I-I've got some...

902
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:52,407

他会帮助我们留下房子
He's gonna help us
keep the house.

908
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:15,646
在我对你做了这些之后你为什么还这样做
Why would you do that
after what I did?

909
00:58:18,218 --> 00:58:21,979
我就是这样对当妈的说对不起的
JAX: It's just my way of
saying sorry to a mother.

910
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:32,699
