00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:10,976
戴森我只是...我只是很不安
I'm just... I'm getting restless, Dyson.

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,744
我记得的最后一件事是我被带出了戴尔
The last thing I remember is being taken from the Dal,

3
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:15,246
醒来的时候就在树林里
then waking up in the woods.

4
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:17,015
我不能一直躲着等待答案
I can't keep hiding, waiting for answers.

5
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:19,284
在尤那达人人安定下来之前先保持低调吧
Gotta lay low until the Una Mens settle down.

6
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:21,987
所以他们想让我死 排队! 拿号!
So they want me dead. Line up! Take a number!

7
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,989
恭喜加入啊! 还要我继续吗?
Welcome to the club! Should I keep going?

8
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,823
波 这比你想象的严重
This is bigger than you think, Bo.

9
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:28,049
尤那达人人的力量来自远古 
The Una Mens power is ancient. 

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:28,926
不听不听
Dun dun dun.

11
00:00:30,596 --> 00:00:32,363
- 我很严肃地 - 抱歉
- I'm serious. - I'm sorry.

12
00:00:32,397 --> 00:00:35,600
但是幻想委员会? 古老条例?
But fancy councils? Ye old rules?

13
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:39,303
这些是我脑中最不愿想的事
It's just, it's the last thing on my mind.

14
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:42,807
你想谈谈你脑中最想的事吗?
You want to talk about that first thing on your mind?

15
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:48,912
- ...有消息吗? - 最近没有
- ...any word? - Not lately.

16
00:00:48,946 --> 00:00:53,217
但是她处于未知 安全远离是最好的
But it's better that she stays away safe with all of these unknowns.

17
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:54,718
劳伦很聪明 她可以自行解决
Lauren's smart, she can handle herself.

18
00:00:54,752 --> 00:00:58,022
好吧 既然我得保护我自己
Well, since I have to protect myself

19
00:00:58,056 --> 00:01:00,157
远离未知...
from all these unknowns...

20
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:07,263
应该换我被打了 腰带往下哦
I should get a hit. Below the belt.

21
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:14,804
你有些不一样了哦
Something is different about you.

22
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:18,343
这个嘛...你看起来很喜欢 疯狂喜欢
Well... you seem to like it. In a huge way.

23
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:28,843
- 那是什么? - 我不知道 旧管道?
- What was that? - I don't know. Old pipes?

24
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:40,187
当你不知你是谁时 生活会很艰辛
Life is hard when you don't  know who you are.

25
00:02:40,222 --> 00:02:43,156
当你知道真相后 生活会更艰难
It's harder when you don't know what you are.

26
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,126
我的爱伴随着死亡的降临
My love carries a death sentence.

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,428
我迷失了多年
I was lost for years...

28
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:51,131
在藏匿中找寻
searching, while hiding.

29
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:55,301
那个不为人知的属于我的世界
Only to find that I belong to a world hidden from humans.

30
00:02:55,336 --> 00:02:57,004
但我已厌倦躲藏
I won't hide anymore.

31
00:02:57,038 --> 00:02:59,739
我要过自己想要的生活
I will live the life I choose.

32
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:08,714
- 好了 少喝烈酒 多翘屁股!- 嗷嗷
- All right, less hooch, more tooch! - Owww-owww...

33
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:11,050
好了 好了 最后一下 呼吸 呼吸
Okay, okay, one more knot. Just breathe, just breathe.

34
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:13,153
好了 好了
There you go. There you go.

35
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:17,957
完事了 天哪 还不是一股
Done. God, not a single strand.

36
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:21,060
我跳完电臀舞了 我能吃点奶酪泡芙吗?
I'm done twerking out. Can I have Cheezies?

37
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:23,428
- 是的 你可以吃点 - 谢谢
- Yes, you can have Cheezies. - Thank you.

38
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:26,231
呃!
Ugh!

39
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:28,868
肯吉 特里克的异基尼斯防护又出毛病了
Kenz, Trick's Ignis Rim is acting up again.

40
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:32,371
呃 我来了! 抱歉 我可能设定错了
Ugh, coming! Sorry, I probably just set it up wrong.

41
00:03:32,405 --> 00:03:34,706
它应该只能阻挡邪恶的异种
It's only supposed to block out malicious Fae.

42
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:44,383
你回来真是太好了
Oh, I'm so glad you're home.

43
00:03:44,984 --> 00:03:45,984
过来
Come here.

44
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,754
你闻起来像是汗淋淋的健身男 但是我不介意
You smell like sweaty gym-dude and I don't even care.

45
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:52,857
嗯 肯吉我走了一小时了并不是我在意
Uh, Kenz, I've been gone an hour. And not that I mind,

46
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:55,226
但是这个持续拥抱还要多久?
but how long is this incessant hugging gonna last?

47
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,429
只要能让你忘了你离开过
As long as it takes to forget you were ever gone.

48
00:03:58,463 --> 00:03:59,672
来点奶酪泡芙? 
Cheezie? 

49
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,365
不 我挺好的 已经吃过了
No. I'm good, I already ate.

50
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,433
戴森和我只是...
Dyson and I just...

51
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:06,270
别在小-朋-友 瓦-科-基面前说
Oh! Not in front of the B-A-B-Y  V-A-L-K... E?

52
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:08,506
- 或者是 Y? - 我不是小孩了!
- Or is it, Y? - I'm not a baby!

53
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,474
我已经两周大了 谢谢
I'm almost two weeks old. Thank you.

54
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:13,811
好吧 小孩 你想起你为谁工作了吗?
All right, tweener 'tude. You remember who you work for yet?

55
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:15,784
我告诉你了 我不记得 
I already told you, I don't remember. 

56
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:17,548
这是个人隐私 好吗?
It's called a previous life, okay?

57
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,817
到目前为止 我所知道的就是我是黑暗
So far, all I know is that I'm Dark.

58
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:21,952
这让我觉得你知道的比告诉我的多
Which makes me think you know more than you're telling me...

59
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:27,057
你懂的 这个年龄的孩子 还能干啥?
Oh, you know, kids this age. Whaddya gonna do?

60
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:33,030
你知道吗? 俱乐部封锁了管他呢
You know what? Screw club house arrest.

61
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,372
嗯!我们出去吧 
Mm! Let's go out. 

62
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:36,466
那这里的奶酪泡芙小孩怎么办?
What about Cheezie breath over here?

63
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,701
嘿 小'T
Hey, Lil' T.

64
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,470
你想一起来吗? 很无聊 一点也不好玩
Do you wanna come out with us? Totally boring, not fun.

65
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:42,972
或者你想呆在这个安全的边缘带里
Or do you want to stay in safety rim zone

66
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:44,835
并且再看一遍X档案? 
and watch the X-Files again? 

67
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:46,243
X档案? 当然!
X-Files. Yes!

68
00:04:46,277 --> 00:04:47,611
- 成交 - 嗯!
- Done. - Mm!

69
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:50,213
... 饮料! 耶!
... drinks! Yeah!

70
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,115
为我们干杯
Drink to us.

71
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:56,152
嗯 就像这里占领了法国一样
Mmm. It is like occupied France in here.

72
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:57,419
怎么音乐这么悲伤?
What's with the cry tunes?

73
00:04:57,454 --> 00:04:59,421
尤那达人人来到镇上了 一切一切都关闭了
Una Mens come to town, errrrything shut down.

74
00:04:59,456 --> 00:05:01,924
好吧 我希望来一个真正的夜不归宿
Yeah well, I was hoping for a real night out.

75
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,192
好吧 抱歉 春假小姐
Well, sorry Miss Spring Breaker.

76
00:05:03,227 --> 00:05:05,194
我向戴森保证了我会带你到安全的地方
I promised Dyson I'd take you somewhere safe.

77
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:07,220
哦! 你记得那团绑架我
Oh! You remember a cloud of black smoke 

78
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:09,031
到这里的黑雾 对吗?
kidnapped me here, right?

79
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,532
是的
Right.

80
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:13,101
我们是否知道关于这个浪人的什么...
Do we know anything about this Wander...

81
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:16,605
...呃 我不想讨论这个话题
... Ahhh. I don't feel like talking about it.

82
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,006
我想跳舞
I wanna dance.

83
00:05:18,642 --> 00:05:22,144
玩真的?　在这? 萨德威勒里?
Are you for real? Right here? In Sadville?

84
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,861
现在就像了
Now that is more like it.

85
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:44,098
波波回来啦
Bobo returns.

86
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:51,138
还带了特别福利...?
With bonus features...?

87
00:06:09,357 --> 00:06:10,524
嘿!
Hey!

88
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:13,794
- 你带了吗? - 我来的太匆忙
- Did you bring it? - I'm in a rush.

89
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:15,629
什么? 样品诱卖?
What? Flip flop sample sale?

90
00:06:15,663 --> 00:06:18,665
我受够了幼儿玩具 现在是卡车卖场
I'm done with the kiddy toys. It's Tonka Truck time.

91
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,268
你做梦也买不起永久能量
You can't even dream to afford for permanent powers.

92
00:06:22,303 --> 00:06:25,171
你也不能负担得起我供货的东西
You can't even pay me for what I supply.

93
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:28,375
等着瞧吧 你会拿到支付的
Look, you will get paid...

94
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:32,312
马西莫 只要我的能量不衰退
as soon as my powers stop fading. Massimo.

95
00:06:41,188 --> 00:06:44,523
肯吉? 波?
Kenzi? Bo?

96
00:06:44,558 --> 00:06:47,493
...Mulder? 斯克里?
...Mulder? Scully?

97
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:50,563
哦天哪 你们在这干什么?
Oh my god, what are you doing here?

98
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:10,148
# 这是个完整的故事 #
So here's a story from A-to-Z

99
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:12,417
# 仔细听 跟上我 #
you wanna get with me you gotta listen carefully

100
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:15,353
# 恩姆在这里 爱你显而易见 #
We got Em in the place who likes it in your face.

101
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:18,337
# G像主持人 乐在其中 #
We got G like MC who likes it on an. Easy V doesn't

102
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,719
# V不会免费上门 她是正牌淑女 #
come for free. She's a real lady, 

103
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,980
# 至于我 可看到 #
as for me, ah you'll see.

104
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:24,255
# 砰然倒地 吹向四方 #
Slam your body down and wind it all around.

105
00:07:24,323 --> 00:07:26,548
# 砰然倒地 吹向四方 #
Slam your body down and wind it all around!

106
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,400
# 欲成我真爱 #
If you wanna be my lover.

107
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:31,401
# 先拢我挚友 先拢我挚友 #
You gotta get with my friends. You gotta get with my friends.

108
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:35,363
# 使友谊固若金汤 恒久不变 #
Make it last forever friendships never end...

109
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:40,278
惊喜! 你会发疯吗?
Surprise! Are you so mad?

110
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:41,779
事实上 这太惊人了!
Actually, that was freakin' incredible!

111
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:48,419
变坏的感觉真好
It feels so good to be bad.

112
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:54,258
肯吉 我们被打劫了
Kenzi. We've been robbed.

113
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,159
塔米辛
Tamsin.

114
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,367
我觉得我又长大了
I think I grew again.

115
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:10,686
有人在我们家里 陌生人!
People were in our home. Strangers!

116
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:13,490
而且是对旧家具有特殊品味的陌生人
Strangers with great taste in thrift shop furniture.

117
00:08:13,524 --> 00:08:15,387
你想让我给你什么吗?
Would you like me to get you something?

118
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:16,890
一杯咖啡或者一张休息的椅子? 
A coffee or chair to break? 

119
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:17,927
我会干掉做这件事的人
I'm gonna break whoever did this.

120
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:19,795
我们家还有个孩子!
We had a child in the home!

121
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:24,901
类似孩子吧 会不会是尤那达人人?
Sort of. Ugh, could this be Una Mens?

122
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:26,301
不 他们不是小偷
No, they're not thieves.

123
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:29,405
他们对物质财产没兴趣
Material possessions don't interest them.

124
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,306
但是也许这跟异种毫无关系
But maybe this isn't Fae-related at all.

125
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:33,676
也许只是非法侵入
Maybe it's just a good old break and enter.

126
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,078
如果那个边界去掉了 人类依然可以进入
If that rim was up, humans could still enter.

127
00:08:36,112 --> 00:08:37,295
无论是不是异种 
Fae or not, 

128
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:39,515
没人会进入我的房子拿走我的东西
no one comes into my house and takes what's mine.

129
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,205
你懂 如果你待会需要放松 
You know, if you need to unwind later, 

130
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:42,351
我们可以 呃...
we could, uh...

131
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:48,524
- 逛街 - 对啊 逛街

132
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:52,928
好吧 如果你感觉还不错 你可以随便逛
Well, if you're good, you can go in all the stores.

133
00:08:54,264 --> 00:08:57,398
好吧 如果你感觉不错 我会刷爆你的卡
Well if you're good, I'll max out your credit cards.

134
00:08:57,433 --> 00:09:00,234
- 两倍 - 我可以来吗?
- Twice. - Can I come?

135
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,473
我会列出可疑名单再追踪
I've got a suspicious lead to track.

136
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:08,043
- 让我帮你吧 - 你已经在帮忙了
- Let me help. - Oh, you already are.

137
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:10,645
当我从设施那回来时 我会解释的
I'll explain when I get back from the facilities!

138
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:15,316
波! 浴室在...另一边
Bo! The bathroom is... the other way.

139
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:21,589
并且...我在照顾小孩
And... I'm babysitting.

140
00:09:25,494 --> 00:09:27,095
那个女孩是谁?
Who's that girl?

141
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:31,665
走失人员 我们需要找到她
Someone who's lost. And you and I need to find her.

142
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:43,143
这都是我的错 我相信了他们
This is all my fault. I believed them...

143
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:47,614
他们告诉我不会伤害你
They told me they wouldn't hurt you.

144
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:54,421
他们是谁?
Who are "they"?

145
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:58,858
你好 好久不见 劳伦
Hello. Long time no see, Lauren.

146
00:09:58,892 --> 00:10:02,129
或者我该叫你...Karen
Or should I call you... Karen.

147
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:05,798
来吧 马西莫
Come on, Massimo.

148
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:09,468
我要解禁钱包 我正觊觎一双鞋
I've got wallets to lift; shoes to covet...

149
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:11,938
噢! 干什么?!
Ow! What the hell?!

150
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:13,006
嘿!!
Hey!!

151
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:17,543
好吧 我平时的轿车和大杯摩卡冰拿铁呢?
Okay, where's my usual SUV and Venti-Mocha-Iced-latte?

152
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:20,312
那些不付钱的顾客是没有会员待遇的
No VIP treatment for customers that don't pay.

153
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,481
他要给你颜色看看
He's sending a message.

154
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:24,517
那你...你告诉他
Well you... you give a message that

155
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:28,154
他把拉链拉好放他的小德鲁伊附近...
he can take this zip tie and put it around his tiny druid...

156
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,691
有人吗 发生什么事
Hello?! What's happening?

157
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:34,059
没事了 波
Three-nothing, Bo.

158
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:37,395
那我们东西 我可不会让你带走肯吉
Take our things, but you will not take my Kenzi.

159
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,464
跟你还跟对了
Uh, followed you just in time, sketch bag.

160
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:41,399
- 来吧 - 谢谢你
- Come on. - Oh. Thank you!

161
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,135
- 救了我 - 肯吉
- For saving me! - Kenz.

162
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:44,936
什么时候你开始单飞了
Since when do you fly solo, huh?

163
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:46,462
我回来了 我们重回以前了 
I'm back, we're back, 

164
00:10:46,463 --> 00:10:47,839
小孩也回来了 一起回归啊
baby got back. Together-like.

165
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:50,408
我认识这些人 我叫他们来的
Look, I know these guys. Like, called them know them.

166
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,077
什么 你现在喜欢被绑起来了 
What? You're into getting zip-tied now?

167
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:53,704
不 我知道谁抢了我们 
No, I know who robbed us. 

168
00:10:53,705 --> 00:10:55,588
而且都是我的错 我会弥补的
But it's my problem and I can handle it.

169
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,950
是我们的问题 让我们把东西拿回来吧
Hey, it's our problem. Let's get our shit back.

170
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:03,154
- 话说这人谁啊 - 马西莫
- So who is this guy, anyway? - Massimo.

171
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:06,791
- 德鲁伊马西莫? - 你知道他?
- Druid Massimo? - You know him?

172
00:11:06,825 --> 00:11:09,193
没错 他烂透了
Yeah, I do. And he sucks.

173
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:16,661
诡异的德鲁伊
... creepy druid.

174
00:11:16,696 --> 00:11:21,265
波 对未知举步维艰?
Bo. Tough times in parts unknown?

175
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,701
这你可是想不起来的
Not that you would remember.

176
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:26,804
你的神秘玻璃药剂撒到地上了
Your rune glass potion fell flat.

177
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:29,707
我可不这么想
Yeah, I'm not so sure that it did.

178
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:33,578
谢谢你亲吻的封印
Thanks to the seal from your kiss.

179
00:11:33,612 --> 00:11:35,946
什么神秘玻璃药剂
Rune-glass-potion-what-now?

180
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,849
我要知道我有能力
I like to know when I'm sealing something.

181
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:41,484
他给塔米辛药剂来杀我
He gave Tamsin a potion to kill me.

182
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,022
其实是标记你 允许你超出平面
Actually, to mark you. Allow you to transcend planes;

183
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:46,123
被收集
to be collected.

184
00:11:46,157 --> 00:11:50,261
是个双保险 以防塔米辛反悔
An insurance policy in case Tamsin didn't pan out.

185
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,263
她死了真可惜啊
It's a shame that she died.

186
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:58,801
悲剧 谁带我走的?
Tragic. Who took me?

187
00:11:59,237 --> 00:12:02,305
不幸的是 我只是受雇送货的
Unfortunately, I was just hired to deliver the goods.

188
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,641
肯定我能告诉你点什么
There must be something I can tell you...

189
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:07,444
没有 一无所知
Nah. There's nothing.

190
00:12:09,347 --> 00:12:13,382
接下来是这样 你把我们东西还回来
Well here's how this is gonna go: you're gonna give us our stuff back

191
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,451
并且不许再招惹肯吉
and then you're gonna leave Kenzi alone.

192
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,687
她不需要你的服务了
She won't be requiring your services any longer.

193
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:25,327
她的欠债可未还清
That doesn't settle her debt.

194
00:12:25,362 --> 00:12:28,530
没有吗? 给你一脚见钱眼开
No? How about a knee to your euro-sack?

195
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:31,199
好的好的 让我们像成人一样解决问题嘛
Okay, okay why don't we just handle this like adults?!

196
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:33,702
异种 德鲁伊 人类 一起来
Fae, Druid, human ... comin' together.

197
00:12:33,737 --> 00:12:35,937
地球和平 我们是世界啊
Peace on Earth. We are the world.

198
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:39,808
- 什么的 - 我有提议
- Kind of... stuff. - I have a proposal.

199
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,510
现在又想3P了是嘛
Mm, here comes the threesome request.

200
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:44,212
好主意 留下次吧
Let's bank the trio idea 'til next time.

201
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:47,615
日本猪毛菜苏打草药 十分罕见
The Japanese Salsola Soda herb. It's very rare.

202
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,718
我听说长在光明派异种医生的绿墙里
But I hear it grows on the Light Fae Doctor's green wall.

203
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:53,621
- 你想让我去劳伦那里? - 你认识她?
- You want me to go to Lauren's? - Do you know her?

204
00:12:55,158 --> 00:12:57,358
你帮我拿来 我们两清
You get it for me, and we're even.

205
00:12:59,095 --> 00:13:00,495
杰拉尔丁?
Geraldine?

206
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:04,732
我要把这个拿回去 我们的东西呢?
I'm taking this back. What about our stuff?

207
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:08,269
我没烧的都让你拿回去 
You'll get back what I haven't burnt. 

208
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,271
相信我 帮你们大忙了
Did you a favour, trust me.

209
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:11,839
那些口音桌子?
Those accent tables?

210
00:13:13,842 --> 00:13:17,244
好吧 我们帮你拿草药
Fine. We'll get you the herb.

211
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,015
要是你食言不兑现
But if you don't hold up your end of the bargain,

212
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:22,349
我就杀了你
I'll kill you.

213
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:29,690
我的梳子? 你留着吧
And my hairbrush? You can keep.

214
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:31,859
一点也不诡异...
Because that's not creepy at all...

215
00:13:46,808 --> 00:13:48,608
我们被监视了
We're being watched.

216
00:13:51,612 --> 00:13:55,148
你找到我了 现在怎样
You found me. Now what?

217
00:13:55,883 --> 00:13:58,051
防水布一号下面是什么
What's behind tarp number one?

218
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:04,157
他们想让我们看
They want us to look.

219
00:14:04,491 --> 00:14:08,728
玩他们的游戏 我不玩了
Play their little game. I'm done playing.

220
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:14,099
- 我跟你睡了 - 克里斯朵
- I slept with you... - Oh crystal.

221
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:15,200
不
No.

222
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,775
因为他们逼我的 跟你亲密
Because they made me. To keep you close.

223
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:26,647
可是之后 我 我不知道
But then, after I did... I ... I don't know.

224
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:33,887
那样特别 你知道吗 有感情了
It was different, you know? It was more.

225
00:14:40,108 --> 00:14:44,630
- 间谍床戏 - 我有错过什么吗
- Ahh. Spy-banged. - Did I miss something?

226
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:52,840
我曾来过这
I've been here before.

227
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:56,140
其实 跟你处境一样
In your shoes, actually.

228
00:15:20,498 --> 00:15:24,301
我有个兄弟
I have a brother.

229
00:15:24,335 --> 00:15:28,993
我唯一的兄弟 不可分离
My only sibling. We were inseparable.

230
00:15:29,974 --> 00:15:33,509
我们一起想改变世界
Together, we were going to change the world.

231
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:37,713
- 听着不错 - 确实不错
- Sounds nice. - Yeah, yeah it was.

232
00:15:37,748 --> 00:15:40,317
可后来变了
Until it wasn't anymore.

233
00:15:40,351 --> 00:15:44,755
我们改变世界的方法是
Our version of changing the world turned into

234
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:49,725
用炸弹炸毁管道
blowing up pipelines using pipe bombs.

235
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,598
十一位丧生
Eleven people died.

236
00:15:57,534 --> 00:15:59,134
你是恐怖分子?
You're a terrorist?

237
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:03,479
那里应该没有人的
Nobody was supposed to be there...

238
00:16:06,845 --> 00:16:10,612
我因此每天恨自己 酿成惨祸
Not a day goes by that I don't hate myself for what happened.

239
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:16,585
- 不是你的错 - 我做的炸药
- It wasn't your fault. - I made the explosives.

240
00:16:16,619 --> 00:16:19,621
让我兄弟保管了
And then I trusted my brother with them.

241
00:16:23,225 --> 00:16:25,059
他现在在哪?
Where is he now?

242
00:16:27,162 --> 00:16:29,464
重点是 凯伦逃跑了
Point is, is that Karen ran.

243
00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:31,833
自那以后 我一直在逃
And I have been running ever since.

244
00:16:39,174 --> 00:16:43,444
我不懂为什么跟你说这个
I don't even know why I'm telling you this.

245
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:45,646
我永远不会告诉波的
I never even told Bo.

246
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:50,784
感人肺腑 现在 看防水布后面
Moving story. Now, look under the tarp.

247
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:55,823
我猜我玩的游戏还没结束
I guess I'm not done playing games just yet.

248
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:22,015
长老需要你一小时内出诊断
An elder needs your diagnosis within the hour.

249
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,484
否则克里斯朵死
Or Crystal dies.

250
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,736
这根本不是环保狂 根本就是光明派异种胡来
This isn't about eco terrorism. This is Light Fae bullshit.

251
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:36,829
我试着理解 肯吉 真的
I'm trying to understand, Kenz, really, I am.

252
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:39,098
你为什么会找那个烂人?
Why would you ever go to that nutbag?

253
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:41,400
我受够让别人对我指手画脚了
I was tired of everyone telling me to "go".

254
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,903
我那也不想去 我想跟你战斗
I don't want to "go" anywhere. I want to fight with you.

255
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,838
你是啊 你一直都跟我并肩作战
But you do. You always have.

256
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:49,075
我以为会很简单的好么
Look, I thought it'd be simple, you know.

257
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,609
去找马西莫 做个交易
Go see Massimo. Make a deal.

258
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:53,612
成为异种 可到头来还是有时效的
Become Fae. But it turned out to be temporary.

259
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:57,349
- 就闪点火光 - 花了你多少?
- And a little on the chintzy side. - How much did it cost you?

260
00:17:57,384 --> 00:17:58,717
再一点草药 亲爱的
One more herb, baby.

261
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:03,789
太爽了 这些都看起来一样啊
Phew! Well I'm glad these all look identical.

262
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:05,523
当你需要劳伦的时候她在哪
Where's Lauren when you need her?

263
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:09,194
情伤了?
Ex nostalgia attack?

264
00:18:11,263 --> 00:18:14,866
整件塔夫特的事还是困扰我
You know, this whole Taft thing still baffles me.

265
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:19,137
劳伦很聪明 我是说 也许她没被骗
I mean, Lauren is smart! I mean, maybe she wasn't tricked.

266
00:18:19,171 --> 00:18:23,341
也许她愿意为他工作 从他那里获利?
Maybe she wanted to work for him, you know, get something from him?

267
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:27,145
- 养老保险? - 我不知道
- Like... a pension? - I don't know.

268
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,046
显而易见 我们的关系建立在
Apparently the foundation of our entire relationship

269
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:30,948
一无所知之上
was based on "not knowing".

270
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:32,550
不管值不值得
Well, look, for whatever it's worth

271
00:18:32,585 --> 00:18:34,986
我想劳伦是好人
I think that Lauren's one of the good ones.

272
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,221
我一直以为你站在戴森这边
I always thought you were on Dyson.

273
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:40,024
在? 什么在? 你什么意思
On? What... what on? What do you mean?

274
00:18:40,058 --> 00:18:43,961
你懂嘛 狼群 这是什么
Oh, you know, Team Wolf. What is this?

275
00:18:49,134 --> 00:18:53,537
是真的 她的名字不叫劳伦
It's true. Her name is not Lauren.

276
00:18:53,571 --> 00:18:56,906
是卡伦 卡伦・碧蒂
It's Karen. Karen Beattie.

277
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:58,642
听起来一点也不性感
Okay, not the sexiest moniker.

278
00:18:58,676 --> 00:19:00,644
秒懂她为什么改名了
Kinda get why she might have changed it.

279
00:19:00,678 --> 00:19:01,778
我不认识她
I didn't know her.

280
00:19:01,812 --> 00:19:03,313
拜托 宝贝 不会的
Come on babe, that's not true.

281
00:19:03,348 --> 00:19:05,249
会的 我甚至不知道她的名字
No, I don't even know her name!

282
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:07,784
现在她也许又换了新名字
And now she's probably changed it again.

283
00:19:07,818 --> 00:19:10,687
开始了新生活 在安全的地方...
Started a new, better life. Somewhere safe...

284
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:11,921
远离我
away from me.

285
00:19:13,824 --> 00:19:15,125
你还好吧
Look, you okay over there?

286
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:17,160
好啊 在我前任的家里逛
Oh, yeah. Just hangin' in my ex's apartment.

287
00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:19,262
找奇怪的东西 我没事
Finding weird shit. I'm fine.

288
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:28,937
为什么我生命中的人都要对我撒谎?
What is it that makes everyone in my life lie to me?

289
00:19:30,507 --> 00:19:33,042
除了你 也正是我爱你的原因
Except for you. That's why I love you.

290
00:19:35,745 --> 00:19:39,514
- 天啊 我找到了 - 爱你没错啊
- Oh my god, I found it! - Ah, also why I love you.

291
00:19:47,256 --> 00:19:49,725
- 你防护那门了吗 - 没有
- Did you rim the door? - No.

292
00:19:50,827 --> 00:19:53,996
异基尼斯防护 特里克提过
Ignis Rim Converterent. Trick mentioned this.

293
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,264
不是不让异种进入 而是不许外出
Instead of keeping Fae out, it locks them in.

294
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,266
马西莫一定见过我们的
Massimo must have seen ours...

295
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:03,871
他变态指数大大飙升啊
And he just graduated from a-hole to douche.

296
00:20:03,906 --> 00:20:05,540
好了 让我过吧
Okay, let me try crossing.

297
00:20:05,575 --> 00:20:07,975
警告 我的夹克可是高燃物
Warning: My poly-blend jacket is highly flammable.

298
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,744
一跃而过 宝贝 一跃而过
Drop and roll, baby. Drop and roll.

299
00:20:09,778 --> 00:20:12,413
好的 好的
Okay, okay...

300
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:16,483
天啊 真他妈的疼
Ah! Oh god! It stings like a mother!

301
00:20:16,518 --> 00:20:18,720
马西莫玩的哪出?
What sick game is Massimo playing?

302
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:27,962
- 嘿 - 戴森 猜怎么着?
- Hey. - Dyson. Guess what?

303
00:20:27,996 --> 00:20:31,432
我找的劳伦的语音信箱和俱乐部号八次诶!
I found Lauren's voicemail and the clubhouse number eight times!

304
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:33,066
你觉得赞吧 没错哦
Are you impressed? Yeah you are.

305
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:35,769
他的最后一通电话是两天前
His last call was two days ago.

306
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:37,571
我去调出高速路沿线的所有办公
I'm gonna pull records from all businesses

307
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:39,306
和公用电话的记录
and pay phones along that highway.

308
00:20:39,341 --> 00:20:41,342
准备好更多的荧光笔
Get ready for more highlighting.

309
00:20:42,644 --> 00:20:47,303
好重啊 我曾是个好警察吗
Oh. This is heavy. Was I a good cop?

310
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:49,049
你很硬派
You were tough.

311
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:53,519
心情不好的时候 你可是个魔鬼
On a bad day, you could be a real... monster.

312
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:56,990
你觉得我很可怕
You think I'm hideous!

313
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:59,525
连强盗看到我都会被吓跑
Even the robbers ran away when they saw my face!

314
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,527
我说的魔鬼是夸你呢 好吗
I meant monster in a good way, okay?

315
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:02,862
这根本就说不通
That doesn't even make sense!

316
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:04,964
嘘 拜托
Shh! Please.

317
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:11,638
- 波是你的女朋友吗 - 不 不是
- Is Bo your girlfriend? - No. She is not.

318
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:13,539
但是你想让她做你女朋友吗 
But do you want her to be?

319
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:17,087
我曾经想... 
I did... 

320
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:19,151
后来树上有个姑娘带走了我的爱
but then a lady in a tree took my love away.

321
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:25,585
等我回来的时候 波已经有女朋友了
And by the time I got it back, Bo had a girlfriend.

322
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:30,189
你忘记开头说'从前'了
You forgot to start with 'once upon a time'.

323
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:33,759
从前...我们从没在对的时间相遇 没了
Once upon a time... we never found the right time. The End.

324
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,233
爱一个人是什么感觉 
What does love feel like? 

325
00:21:37,234 --> 00:21:38,797
我们真的要谈这个吗
Are we really doing this?

326
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:47,138
等你感受到的时候 你就懂了
When you feel it, you'll know it.

327
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:51,916
当爱情消逝 你再也不会想失去它
And when it's gone, you'll never want to lose it again.

328
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:55,013
知道吗 去找波和肯吉谈这事吧 好吗
You know what, talk to Bo and Kenzi about this stuff, okay?

329
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,981
我真的不擅长这个
It's really not my bag.

330
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,210
我不能去找波谈 
I can't talk to Bo. 

331
00:21:58,211 --> 00:22:00,151
因为我是黑暗派的 她讨厌我
She hates me because I'm Dark.

332
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,686
好吧 每人都有自己的选择
Well, everyone makes a choice.

333
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,923
除了我 那是之前的我选的
Not me. It was the me before me.

334
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:08,058
好吧 也许哪天你能做出更好的选择
Well, maybe someday you'll get to make a better choice.

335
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:10,561
也许不能 反正这不是我的问题
Maybe not. It's not my problem.

336
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,697
为什么你要那么刻薄
Why do you have to be so mean?!

337
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,598
为什么你有那么多问题
Why do you have so many questions?!

338
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,694
我无法相信他用肯吉的方法证明了 
I can't believe he Kenzi-proofed it. 

339
00:22:17,695 --> 00:22:19,203
他在利用我的力量牵制我
He's playing off my power.

340
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,004
怎么才能让你不放火花
How do we make you stop sparking?

341
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,807
只能等它用完了
Ugh, it kinda just runs out.

342
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,276
你知道 就像防晒霜一样 游完泳得再涂一次
You know, like sunscreen. Reapply after swimming.

343
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:28,311
我想我可以去洗个澡
I guess I can take a shower...

344
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,880
但是...我真的不想把头发弄湿了
but I... I really don't want to get my hair wet.

345
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:32,549
- 真是种折磨 - 我听见了
- It's an ordeal. - I hear ya.

346
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,633
不过 你知道 已经一星期了 
You know what though, it's been a week.

347
00:22:34,634 --> 00:22:35,952
也许我该把它洗掉了
 I probably should wash it.

348
00:22:35,986 --> 00:22:37,620
劳伦的护发素是最差的吗
Is Lauren's conditioner the worst?

349
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:38,455
它就是最差的
It's the worst.

350
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:39,723
它里面含不含有保湿剂的啊
Does it even contain humectants?

351
00:22:39,757 --> 00:22:41,991
天知道那女人抹些什么在头发上
God knows what that woman puts in her hair.

352
00:22:42,025 --> 00:22:43,142
真不能相信她
She cannot be trusted.

353
00:22:43,143 --> 00:22:46,262
我不知道你怎么样 不过我喜欢桃子的洗发水
I don't know about you I need a little peach in my shampoo.

354
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:52,801
- 好清醒 - 好样的
- Refreshing. - Attagirl.

355
00:22:52,836 --> 00:22:55,304
现在 如果唯一能除掉那边的人
Now, if the only one who can remove a rim

356
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:57,230
就是设立它的人... 
is the one who set it... 

357
00:22:57,231 --> 00:22:58,540
不 我们弄乱它
No, we have to scramble it.

358
00:22:58,575 --> 00:23:01,032
我需要一面帕库镜子和一只怪物眼睛 
One Pakua Mirror and ogre eye, required. 

359
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:02,478
难道我是新的特里克吗
Am I the new Trick?

360
00:23:02,512 --> 00:23:03,894
你能找到所有这些东西吗 
Can you get all that stuff? 

361
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:05,080
你难道不知道我是谁吗
Have you met me?

362
00:23:05,114 --> 00:23:06,958
好的 我会救你的 
Okay, I'm gonna save your ass. 

363
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,418
忘记特里克吧 我是新的波
Forget Trick, I'm the new Bo!

364
00:23:09,452 --> 00:23:10,586
好
Okay.

365
00:23:43,585 --> 00:23:45,853
谢谢你给我爱的自由
"For giving me the freedom to love."

366
00:23:49,024 --> 00:23:51,091
我确实给了
And I do.

367
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:29,415
谁在那儿?
Who's there?

368
00:24:48,434 --> 00:24:50,002
...浪人吗
...Wanderer?

369
00:24:58,177 --> 00:25:02,514
你以为我会让你再次把我带走吗?
If you think that I'm gonna let you take me again?

370
00:25:02,548 --> 00:25:05,450
那你就找错淫妖了
You are messing with the wrong Succubus!

371
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:33,076
我来了我来了 我来了
I'm here I'm here I'm here.

372
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:37,314
异基尼斯防护失灵
Ignis adflicto affligo.

373
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:40,250
我成功了 耶
I did it! Yes!

374
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:44,087
- 波 发生什么了 - 你看见了吗
- Bo, what happened? - Did you see it?

375
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,404
我怎么了
What's happening to me?

376
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:06,384
都是我的错
This is all my fault.

377
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:06,988
不 不是 
No, it's not. 

378
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:08,811
你怎么会知道他把什么关在笼子里了
How could you know what he kept in that cage?

379
00:26:08,846 --> 00:26:10,847
- 波 听我说 - 我会处理好这事的
- Bo, listen to me... - I'm gonna take care of this.

380
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:14,016
我欠他的 马西莫 欠他很多
I owe him! Massimo. A lot.

381
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,269
我一直在偷东西来偿还他
Okay, and I've been stealing to pay him.

382
00:26:17,303 --> 00:26:19,204
- 肯吉- 从特里克那偷的
- Kenz. - From Trick!

383
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:20,472
- 肯吉! - 还有从黑尔那儿
- Kenzi! - And from Hale.

384
00:26:20,507 --> 00:26:22,174
我给了他查姆拉细枝
I gave him the Twig of Zamora.

385
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,743
你疯了吗 等等 我都不知道那是什么
Are you crazy!? Wait, I don't know what that is.

386
00:26:24,777 --> 00:26:26,278
他就一直不停地索取索取
And he just keeps taking and taking

387
00:26:26,312 --> 00:26:29,348
可对获得永恒的力量来说还是不够
and it's still not enough for a permanent power.

388
00:26:29,382 --> 00:26:32,651
但我必须得做点什么 人类在被带走 波
But I had to do something. Claimed humans are being taken, Bo!

389
00:26:32,785 --> 00:26:36,520
嘿 我不会让任何人带走你的
Hey. I would never let anyone take you.

390
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:39,357
真的吗 我要记得没错 你刚回来而已
Really? Because last I checked you just got back.

391
00:26:43,162 --> 00:26:47,632
然后我厌倦了感到无助
And I am tired of feeling helpless.

392
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:51,168
不能够...有力量
Not able to... "not able."

393
00:26:51,202 --> 00:26:53,097
等会儿 谁说的 
Wait, who ever said that? 

394
00:26:53,098 --> 00:26:55,373
异种 所有人都这么说
The Fae! Everybody!

395
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,507
总在提醒我
Always reminding me;

396
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:59,677
我很弱 易受伤害 我是个负担
that I'm weak and I'm vulnerable and I'm a liability

397
00:26:59,711 --> 00:27:03,013
还是个贼 还有 我亲了戴森
and a thief and... I kissed Dyson.

398
00:27:03,282 --> 00:27:07,785
- 什么 - 我亲了戴森
- What? - I kissed Dyson.

399
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,625
而最糟的是 我觉得我只想亲黑尔
And the worse part is that, I think I only really want to kiss Hale.

400
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,898
我觉得我... 爱... 喜欢他
I think I... love... like him.

401
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:25,635
也许吧 我也不知道 我只是很孤单
Maybe? I don't even know. I'm just alone.

402
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:29,038
不 你不孤单肯吉 你还有我呢
No, you are not alone, Kenzi. You have me.

403
00:27:29,072 --> 00:27:31,054
我有你 我拥有全部的你 
I have you... I have all of you... 

404
00:27:31,055 --> 00:27:32,542
但当事情发生的时候
but when it comes down to it

405
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:35,345
我根本就没在你心里 对吗
... I don't really have any of you. Do I?

406
00:27:41,718 --> 00:27:45,023
你抛弃过我 波 如果你又走了怎么办
You left me, Bo. What if you go again?

407
00:27:50,593 --> 00:27:53,362
我曾很孤单
I was alone.

408
00:27:53,396 --> 00:27:56,799
我哪儿都不属于
I belonged nowhere.

409
00:27:58,034 --> 00:28:01,837
不管我多努力 我还是不是你们的一员
As hard as I try, I'm just not one of you.

410
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:07,309
查姆拉细枝
Zamora Twigs.

411
00:28:07,344 --> 00:28:10,145
从特里克那偷东西 亲戴森
Stealing from Trick. Kissing Dyson.

412
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:12,314
我都不知道还能发生什么了
I don't even know what is happening anymore.

413
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:14,433
- 波... - 所有那些我
- Bo... - And of all the things

414
00:28:14,434 --> 00:28:18,334
想不通的事... 我从来没觉得会是你干的
I'm in the dark about... I never thought it would be you.

415
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:21,823
这事还没完
We're not done.

416
00:28:26,495 --> 00:28:29,030
- 你好 戴森 - 塔米辛和你在一起吗
- Hello Dyson. - Is Tamsin with you?

417
00:28:29,065 --> 00:28:31,399
没有 我困在劳伦家了 和肯吉一起
No, I've been stuck at Lauren's. With Kenzi.

418
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:32,533
怎么了
What happened?

419
00:28:32,568 --> 00:28:35,636
不知道 我想是我跟她急了 她就走了
I don't know, I guess I snapped at her. She took off.

420
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:36,871
什么
What?

421
00:28:36,905 --> 00:28:39,741
她还只是个孩子 她连怎么扭屁股都还不会 
She's just a baby, she doesn't even know how to twerk yet!!

422
00:28:39,775 --> 00:28:42,243
是啊 她还突然看起来很像我的老搭档
Yeah, well she also suddenly looks like my old partner

423
00:28:42,277 --> 00:28:45,546
总在午餐时间跟赫鲁安乱搞 我来找你们
who used to bang Hydras over lunch. I'm coming to you.

424
00:28:47,115 --> 00:28:49,383
你在马西莫家还看见我们中的谁了
What else of ours did you see at Massimo's?

425
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:50,384
杰拉尔丁
Geraldine.

426
00:28:50,418 --> 00:28:52,118
我的梳子 扔枕头
My hairbrush. Throw pillows.

427
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:53,920
等会儿...你给塔米辛用你的梳子了
Wait... you used your brush on Tamsin.

428
00:28:53,954 --> 00:28:55,955
如果她看见她的头发在里面怎么办
What if he saw her hair in it?

429
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,723
不会的 
No, girl doesn't shed a single lock.

430
00:28:57,758 --> 00:28:59,341
是 但是他是德鲁伊教员 
Yeah, but he's a druid, 

431
00:28:59,342 --> 00:29:00,793
他还是可以侦查她的油脂
he still could have detected her oils.

432
00:29:00,828 --> 00:29:03,472
而且 他的强盗看见了你的金发的姑娘 
Plus, his robber saw a blonde girl. 

433
00:29:03,473 --> 00:29:04,663
他知道她还活着
He knows she's alive.

434
00:29:04,698 --> 00:29:08,368
是啊 很明显瓦科基里的头发相当有价值
Yeah, and apparently Valkryie hair is mad valuable.

435
00:29:08,402 --> 00:29:09,915
马西莫不想让我们死 
Massimo didn't want us dead. 

436
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,303
不 他想让我们困惑
No, he wanted us distracted.

437
00:29:11,337 --> 00:29:13,606
那样他就可以去追求他真正想要的了
So he could go after what he really wants.

438
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,908
追他想要的人
Who he really wants.

439
00:29:15,942 --> 00:29:17,676
- 我一个人去 - 不不不 波
- I'm going alone. - No, no, no Bo...

440
00:29:17,711 --> 00:29:22,358
- 你该等着戴森- 你们很亲密 对吗
- Wait for Dyson. - You guys are close, right?

441
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:34,492
嗨 塔米辛
Hi Tamsin.

442
00:29:36,062 --> 00:29:37,729
你怎么知道我叫什么
How do you know my name?

443
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,935
你当然不记得我了
Of course you don't remember me.

444
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:48,339
但在另一段人生中 我们很亲密
But in another life, we were super close.

445
00:29:56,248 --> 00:29:58,413
看见了吗
You see?

446
00:30:02,988 --> 00:30:05,356
肯吉和波给我打电话了
Kenzi and Bo called me.

447
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,425
她们想让我来接你
Wanted me to come pick you up.

448
00:30:07,459 --> 00:30:08,802
你认识她们吗 
You know them? 

449
00:30:08,803 --> 00:30:10,594
我们可是永远的好朋友
We are best friends forever.

450
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,772
你是来帮我的 是吗 因为我很可怕
You're here to help me aren't you? It's because I'm hideous?

451
00:30:23,608 --> 00:30:25,836
你很完美
You're perfect.

452
00:30:29,335 --> 00:30:32,235
- 为什么你把我捆起来 - 为了保护大家
- Why you tie me up? - To protect everyone.

453
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,226
等你变成真正的自己的时候 
For when you turn into your true self. 

454
00:30:35,227 --> 00:30:36,606
真正的自己
Ow. My true self?

455
00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:40,443
嗯 一个魔鬼
Uh-hunh. A monster.

456
00:30:40,478 --> 00:30:42,336
我有麻烦了吗 
Am I gonna be in trouble? 

457
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:44,814
亲爱的 你就是个麻烦
Oh honey, you are trouble.

458
00:30:44,848 --> 00:30:49,219
你一直在和异种两面派玩过家家
You've been playing house with the Ambiguously Fae Duo.

459
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,255
波是不结盟的 肯吉是临时的
Bo's unaligned. Kenzi's temp.

460
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,361
但你 你才是真正重要的
But you, you are the real deal.

461
00:31:00,698 --> 00:31:02,165
因为我是黑暗派的吗
Because I'm Dark?

462
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:05,267
正是 你是坏人
Exactly! You're bad.

463
00:31:05,302 --> 00:31:07,336
哦 不 它流淌在你的血液里
Oh no, it's in your blood.

464
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:11,608
而你变成一个杀手
And it's only a matter of time before you

465
00:31:12,642 --> 00:31:14,376
只是时间问题
become a killer.

466
00:31:17,814 --> 00:31:19,715
这就是为什么你需要我
And that is why you need me.

467
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,518
我杀人吗
I kill people?

468
00:31:24,187 --> 00:31:27,723
你曾试图杀波 我帮了你
You tried to kill Bo. I helped you.

469
00:31:27,757 --> 00:31:29,290
我们是一伙的 
We're a team!

470
00:31:30,593 --> 00:31:32,293
难怪波那么讨厌我
That's why Bo hates me.

471
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:34,796
慢慢习惯吧 因为我们这类人
Get used to it. 'Cause people like us?

472
00:31:37,734 --> 00:31:39,367
我们注定孤独死去
We die alone.

473
00:32:05,861 --> 00:32:08,495
瞧瞧这头发
Look at that hair.

474
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:12,399
太美了 太有光泽了
It's so fine. It's so young.

475
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:16,303
我已经等了很久了 现在终于是我的了...
I've waited for this for so long. Now it's finally mine...

476
00:32:16,337 --> 00:32:20,375
唯一能得到年轻瓦科基里的头发...
and the only way to obtain a young Valkyrie's hair...

477
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:23,410
方法就是把它们剃掉
is to make it fall out willingly.

478
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:27,247
永远不要剪掉女人不想剪的头发
Never give a woman a hair cut she doesn't want.

479
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:33,086
你不该在这
You need to go.

480
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:35,889
因为我要干掉你
'Cause I'm over you.

481
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,029
放开她
Stop. Release.

482
00:32:43,063 --> 00:32:44,397
看好了
Witness.

483
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:51,970
- 我了个去  - 又出现个新的
- Holy shit. - That's new.

484
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:56,175
不是新的 是重生
Not new. Reborn.

485
00:32:59,212 --> 00:33:04,149
你的长老患的是一种海绵状的脑病
Your Elder is suffering from a form of spongiform encephalopathy.

486
00:33:04,184 --> 00:33:06,484
消化后的结果表明他一直在吃
The digestive results show that he's been feeding off

487
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:09,654
本族 有血缘关系的亲属
his own kind, blood relatives.

488
00:33:09,689 --> 00:33:14,126
他要疯了
He's going Mad Fae.

489
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,617
对待这种病的疗法  
Course of treatment: Oh, 

490
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,096
我不知道 也许要停止一下这样的乱伦
I don't know, maybe lay off the incest a little bit.

491
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:20,665
你不需要绑架我来解决问题
You didn't need to kidnap me to figure this out.

492
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,967
你只需要用你的大脑好好想想就行
You just needed to use your brain for once.

493
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:27,473
因为...这是一个孩子的游戏
Because this... is child's play!

494
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,274
接下来是这样
So here's what's gonna happen.

495
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:34,379
我同意去治疗你那恶心的哥哥
I'm gonna agree to treat your disgusting Elder

496
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:38,015
同时你也要在克里斯朵过敏性休克之前放她走
and you're going to free Crystal before she goes into anaphylactic shock

497
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:41,185
由于你那过时的手铐 让她对镍过敏
from a nickel allergy, due to your antiquated handcuffs.

498
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,420
顺便提下
Oh, and these! By the way...

499
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:47,258
这些孩子的游戏
are child's play.

500
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:50,961
你那不靠谱的女友肯吉...
Your not-quite-girlfriend Kenzi...

501
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,631
教我怎么去撬锁
taught me how to pick a lock.

502
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:02,506
那么...呃 我通过你那奇怪的测试了吗
So... Hm? Did I passed your ridiculous test?

503
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,510
因为如果我通过 你就能出来了 黑尔
Because if I did, you can come on out, Hale.

504
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:19,655
你不就是...黑尔
You're not... Hale.

505
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,097
我是死亡语言家
I am a Harbinger of death.

506
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:30,767
我会乘着被空气保佑过的风到来
I arrive on winds blessed air.

507
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:32,835
空气你也不再需要
Air that you no longer deserve.

508
00:34:34,638 --> 00:34:35,571
求你了
Please.

509
00:34:37,274 --> 00:34:40,710
塔米辛. 小' T.
Tamsin. Lil' T.

510
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:42,478
我知道你想要杀他
I know you want to kill him.

511
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,014
我也想杀他 相信我 但是他不值当
So do I, believe me. But he's not worth it.

512
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:47,716
我来搞定他 我是黑暗使者 还记得吗 
I kill. I am Dark, remember?

513
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,951
你根本没有必要啊
You don't have to.

514
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:51,553
你可以成为你想成为的任何人
You can be whomever you want to be.

515
00:34:51,587 --> 00:34:54,456
你个大骗子 你鄙视我
You're lying! You despise me!

516
00:34:56,526 --> 00:35:00,929
好吧 你知道吗 你是对的
Okay, you know what, you're right,

517
00:35:00,963 --> 00:35:05,700
你和我 在你过去的日子里 我们一直在斗争
you and I, we fought in your past life.

518
00:35:05,735 --> 00:35:08,002
你从来都不是我的菜
You weren't always my favourite.

519
00:35:08,037 --> 00:35:09,622
你用错误的方法把我绑架了 
You rubbed me the wrong way, 

520
00:35:09,623 --> 00:35:11,573
你呃 本可以是个闺蜜
you, uh, could be a real close talker.

521
00:35:11,607 --> 00:35:14,676
但是我从来不恨你
But I never hated you.

522
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:22,083
事实上 我认为你太不可思议了
In fact, I thought you were incredible.

523
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:40,500
那就是爱的感觉
That's what love feels like.

524
00:35:40,534 --> 00:35:44,136
除了我 没有人能和我的室友作战
No one fights with my roommates but me.

525
00:35:46,273 --> 00:35:51,110
现在 到电梯间去 然后闭上眼
Now, go to the elevator close your eyes.

526
00:35:51,144 --> 00:35:52,946
然后把音乐调最大 可以吗 
Turn the music up real loud, okay?

527
00:36:01,654 --> 00:36:05,024
哇哦 你看到了吗
Wow. Did you see that?

528
00:36:05,058 --> 00:36:09,328
我是说 如果你认为之前她是最有力量的 
I mean, if you thought she was powerful before. Woo.

529
00:36:09,363 --> 00:36:12,465
她只是有了翅膀才行 你知道我的意思吗
She just got her wings. Do you know what that means?

530
00:36:12,499 --> 00:36:14,643
每月都会抽筋 水肿... 
Monthly cramps, bloating... 

531
00:36:14,644 --> 00:36:16,635
...这就是她的晚年生活
... this is her last life.

532
00:36:16,669 --> 00:36:19,638
所以我的意思是你救了我的命
So I guess that means you just saved mine.

533
00:36:19,672 --> 00:36:22,240
我才不会让孩子干我那肮脏的工作
I don't let children do my dirty work.

534
00:36:22,274 --> 00:36:23,797
特别是在有人在我送了
Especially after someone sends 

535
00:36:23,798 --> 00:36:25,777
夜行神龙之后来做他们的事情
gargoyles after me to do their's.

536
00:36:25,812 --> 00:36:28,146
- 什么夜行神龙 - 我也不太清楚
- What gargoyles? - I'm not falling for this.

537
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,249
不是吧 说真的 夜行神龙有着很高的威信
No, really. Gargoyles serve a higher authority.

538
00:36:31,283 --> 00:36:35,053
他们会攻击任何挑战他们权威的人 异种长老
They attack whoever threatened their masters. Elder Fae.

539
00:36:35,354 --> 00:36:38,407
所以我猜我们现在甚至有点... 
Hah, so I guess we're even now. 

540
00:36:38,408 --> 00:36:39,425
还不够近
Not even close.

541
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:49,489
那就是为什么你能通过
That's how you got 

542
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,835
那个圈而进入我们的房间
into our house past the rim.

543
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:52,269
你是人类
You're human.

544
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:56,240
我是德鲁伊
I am The Druid.

545
00:36:56,274 --> 00:36:57,652
好吧 你的绝望  
All right, your desperate, 

546
00:36:57,653 --> 00:36:59,644
令人同情的人们 你在寻找我
pathetic people, you seek me.

547
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:01,546
你需要我
You need me.

548
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,581
- 你会尊重我的 - 哦 尊重
- You will respect me! - Oh, respect?

549
00:37:04,615 --> 00:37:09,086
你认为你是人类就可以为所欲为了
You think you can just take whatever you want?

550
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,588
再一次的离塔米辛和肯吉近了一些
Go near Tamsin and Kenzi one more time.

551
00:37:14,292 --> 00:37:15,625
我谅你不敢
I dare you.

552
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:22,265
但是你是异种 肯吉只是个人类
But you're Fae. Kenzi's just human.

553
00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:26,135
不 她是个家人
No. She is family.

554
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:40,049
你需要把那个还给我 来做个交易吧 
You need to give that back. How about we make a deal?

555
00:37:40,084 --> 00:37:42,718
你没有资格做交易
Oh, you are out of deals.

556
00:37:42,752 --> 00:37:46,889
- 我没有耐心了 - 给我吧
- And I am out of patience. - Give it to me!

557
00:37:52,696 --> 00:37:56,366
- 给我 - 你哭了 就因为头发没了
- Just give it. - Are you crying right now? Over hair?

558
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:03,474
我妈妈 需要这个头发
My Mommy, she needs it!

559
00:38:05,508 --> 00:38:08,010
我知道她需要我
And I need her to need me.

560
00:38:08,044 --> 00:38:09,311
妈妈的事情 那也要等等
Mommy issues? Get in line.

561
00:38:09,345 --> 00:38:10,878
求你了
Please.

562
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:17,719
你真是热锅蚂蚁一团糟
You are one hot mess.

563
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,454
话说 热的...
And speaking of hot...

564
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,456
不要
No!!!

565
00:38:21,491 --> 00:38:23,558
咱么谁也不欠了 很高兴认识你
Debt's settled. Nice knowing you.

566
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:26,127
我一定要得到头发 
Now I need to go get it.

567
00:38:36,528 --> 00:38:39,133
不 马西莫 不
No! Massimo no!

568
00:38:55,137 --> 00:38:57,738
我根本有生戴森的气
I'm not mad about Dyson.

569
00:38:57,773 --> 00:38:59,774
- 啥事没有 - 我知道啊
- It meant nothing. - I know.

570
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,136
那个标有我的德鲁伊药水 
That druid potion that marked me? 

571
00:39:06,137 --> 00:39:07,716
很明显我密封的
That I apparently sealed?

572
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,119
需要得到一个从来没有背叛过我的人的吻
It needed to be a kiss from someone who would never betray me...

573
00:39:12,153 --> 00:39:14,921
- 但是我背叛过 - 不 你听好了
- But I did! - No! Listen.

574
00:39:14,956 --> 00:39:19,718
你和我 我们自食其力已经很久了
You and me, we were on our own for a very long time.

575
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:24,264
可我们又找到了彼此
But we found each other.

576
00:39:27,668 --> 00:39:30,545
有时我们也会斗两下
And there will be times when we fight.

577
00:39:32,172 --> 00:39:34,080
因为我们是一家人 
Because we are family. 

578
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:36,510
但是家人就应该在一起的
But family sticks together.

579
00:39:36,544 --> 00:39:39,679
是的 即使我们闹翻了
Yeah, even when we screw up.

580
00:39:48,622 --> 00:39:52,919
- 我很高兴你能回来 - 我会感到无助
- I'm so glad you're back. - And I'm done being helpless.

581
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:58,079
我会感到害怕 我们都会
I am done being scared. We all are.

582
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,863
...然后一个邪恶的野兽
...and then an evil beast 

583
00:40:01,864 --> 00:40:03,636
威胁要剪去她的头发
threatened to cut her hair

584
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:07,205
这让那个小公主非常生气
that made the princess very angry.

585
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,641
她开始逐渐变得漂亮起来 
And she grew beautiful, 

586
00:40:09,642 --> 00:40:11,443
有了一双神奇的翅膀
magical wings,

587
00:40:11,477 --> 00:40:13,979
她扑了过去 把那怪兽叼了起来
and she swooped down, and she picked up the monster

588
00:40:14,014 --> 00:40:15,659
叼着它的耳朵 
by his ears, 

589
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,950
把它扔到一个很远的陆地上去了
and she flew him to a far, far away land.

590
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:21,953
去了一个不会伤害任何人的地方了
Where he would never return to hurt anyone.

591
00:40:21,987 --> 00:40:23,555
再不伤人了
Ever again.

592
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:30,762
天啊 给这个小丫头一点警告 好不
Oh, geeze, give a girl a little warning, will ya.

593
00:40:31,664 --> 00:40:32,730
在这个密室
The inner sanctum.

594
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:35,232
我认为你一直睡在浴缸里
And all this time I thought you slept in the bathtub.

595
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:38,036
不 只有在你吃掉所有排骨之后的星期三
No, only after All-You-Can- Eat-Rib-Tuesdays.

596
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:58,122
你知道你能做任何事情 不是吗
You know you can do anything, right?

597
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:01,325
- 不对 - 不是吗
- Inaccurate. - Not really.

598
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:07,230
你没有必要成为异种从而属于我们
You don't have to be Fae to have a place among us.

599
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,766
这有种方法让你能得到更多
There is a way for you to be more.

600
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,904
我来教你
I can teach you.

601
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:17,841
事关时间 你不这么认为吗 
It's about time, don't you think?

602
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:21,735
是的 完全认为
Yeah! Totally.

603
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:26,783
- 什么 - 等时机成熟 我保证
- What? - When the time is right, I promise.

604
00:41:29,853 --> 00:41:33,525
看看你这个狼人...让所有孩子都想骂你
Look at you Wolf Man... inspiring up all the kids n' shit.

605
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:42,732
- 肯吉... - 嗯?
- Kenzi... - Hm?

606
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:47,536
我把找不到劳伦了
I've lost Lauren.

607
00:41:49,372 --> 00:41:53,876
我想她好像身处危险中 我要找到她
And I think she's in danger. I have to find her.

608
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:09,558
太感动了
Nice touch.

609
00:42:10,226 --> 00:42:12,961
一点也不像家庭装饰
Nothing like a little home decor with bite.

610
00:42:15,998 --> 00:42:17,598
太拥挤了
Tough crowd.

611
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:23,004
当然 太湿了 你没有想过用干燥器
Also, moist. You ever considered a dehumidifier?

612
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,606
你从来没有出现在我们面前
You have not been summoned to appear before us.

613
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:31,145
这里有点事情你必须要知道
Here's a little something that you should know.

614
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:35,285
没有人召唤我 我想什么时候去哪 就去哪
No one summons me. I go where I want, when I want.

615
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:42,031
如果有什么想伤害我 我都能...化解
And if something tries to hurt me, I deal with it.

616
00:42:44,593 --> 00:42:47,961
我不会按照你的要求去活着
I don't live by your rules.

617
00:42:47,996 --> 00:42:51,097
我永远都不会
I will never live by your rules.

618
00:42:51,131 --> 00:42:53,465
你想因为你的规矩而杀了我吗
And if you want to kill me for that?

619
00:42:54,802 --> 00:42:56,069
试试看
Try.

620
00:42:57,337 --> 00:42:59,910
对你的建议我们实在没有兴趣
We are not interested in your proposal.

621
00:43:00,313 --> 00:43:03,976
我们的目的是消除那些没有结盟的淫妖
Our intention was to eliminate the unaligned succubus.

622
00:43:04,011 --> 00:43:06,179
是嘛 就在这
Uh, yeah. Over here.

623
00:43:06,213 --> 00:43:09,682
你的内心已经说话了你已经选好站在哪边了
Your blood has spoken. You have chosen a side.

624
00:43:17,324 --> 00:43:18,424
哪一边?
What side?

625
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,960
你是黑暗派
You are Dark.
