00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,620
我們得找到基拉·汀斯利
We need to find kira tinsley.

21
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,780
她要么跟血腥約翰是一伙的
She either works for Red John,

22
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,790
要么馬上就要成為他下一個目標了
or she's about to become his next victim.

23
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,690
誰干的  告訴我
Who did this to you? Tell me.

24
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,320
簡  她說什么了
Jane, what did she say?

25
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,670
她說血腥約翰左肩膀有個紋身
She told me Red John has a tattoo on his left shoulder--

26
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,940
三個點
Three dots.

簡  別這么做  別扔下我這么做
Jane, don't do this, not without me.

對不起
Listen, I'm sorry.

Jane, I am begging you. You're in danger!

41
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,600
紋身嗎
A tattoo?

42
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,420
對
Yes.

43
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,740
我們可以用那個來確定血腥約翰的身份
That we can use to identify Red John?

44
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,270
-是的  -太好了
- Yes. - That's great.

45
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,360
所以我們只要一個個檢查疑犯
So all we have to do is check each one of the suspects

46
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,590
看哪個人身上就紋身就行了
one by one until we find out who has the tattoo.

47
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,540
不行
No.

48
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,350
為什么不行
Why not?

49
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,580
血腥約翰還不知道我發現紋身的事
Red John doesn't know I know about the tattoo.

50
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,030
好吧
Okay.

51
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,770
所以如果我們去查他們
So if we start checking suspects,

52
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,770
很有可能血腥約翰會發現此事
it's very likely that red john will find out.

53
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,240
然后在我們還沒機會接近他的時候就銷聲匿跡
And disappear before we have a chance of getting him.

54
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,450
正是如此
Exactly.

55
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,820
那你們打算怎么辦
Then what do you want to do?

56
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,430
把五名疑犯同時
Gather all five suspects together

57
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,620
集合到一個地方
at the same place, same time,

58
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,430
然后再檢查是否有紋身
And then start checking for the tattoo.

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,310
如何才能做到呢
And how do we do that?

60
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
就直接叫他們過來
We'll ask them.

61
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,880
你覺得他們會同意嗎
And you think they'll agree?

62
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,250
沒打算給他們選擇的余地
Wasn't planning on giving them a choice.

63
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,120
就算成行了  還有個問題
Even so, there's a problem.

64

布萊特·斯特爾斯因兩起謀殺
Bret Stiles--he's wanted by the F.B.I.

in connection to two homicides.

66
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,370
對  二十多年前的懸案
Yeah. Cold cases from over 20 years ago.

67
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,080
真的假的
You're kidding,

68
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,200
都過去那么多年了
after all this time,

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,730
聯調局現在才跟進嗎
the F.B.I. is moving in now?

70
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,140
他們肯定是有了什么新的
Well, they must have found something new--

71
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,570
-法醫證據  目擊證人  -那斯特爾斯在哪
- forensics, a witness. Well, where's Stiles?

72
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,030
關鍵就是這個  沒人知道他在哪
Well, that's the thing. Nobody knows,

73
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,110
連聯調局也不知道  斯特爾斯幾周前就消失了
Not even the F.B.I. Stiles disappeared weeks ago.

74
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,560
我們會找到他的
We'll find him.

75
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:15,980

How?

不知道  但我們會找到他的
I don't know, but we'll find him.

必須找到他
We have to.

我配合你的計劃
I'm on board with your plan.

Good.

80

On one condition.

81
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,640
你揭露血腥約翰身份的時候我要在場
I want to be there when you reveal Red John.

82
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,580
好的
Okay.

83
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,030
我說真的
Seriously.

84
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,830
-我說了好的  -說是說了  但你說的肯定不算數
- I said okay. - Yeah, but you didn't mean it.

85
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,880
是嗎  你怎么知道
Did I not? Uh, how can you tell?

86
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,670
這事沒有商量的余地  簡
This is non-negotiable, Jane.

87
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,310
我百分百同意
I agree 100%.

88
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,200
我認為我之前說得夠清楚了  探員們
I think I've made myself clear, agents.

89
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,290
我完全不知道布萊特·斯特爾斯在哪
I have no knowledge of Bret Stiles' whereabouts.

90
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,490
對  你說了
Yes,

91
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,640
而我們也表達得很清楚了  你這說法我們不買賬
and we've made it clear that we're not buying it.

92
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,370
斯特爾斯把天眼組織的領導權留給了你
Stiles leaves you in charge of Visualize,

93
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,140
但他卻沒有告訴你他躲藏在哪里嗎
but he keeps you in the dark about where he's hiding?

94
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,290
這根本說不通
Doesn't make sense.

95
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,440
斯特爾斯自始至終
Stiles has and always will

96
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,860
都將教徒的需要放在他自己之前
put the church's needs before his own.

97
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,400
這次也一樣
This time is no different.

98
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,790
他不想讓我知道是因為他想保護我
He doesn't want me to know because he wants to protect me.

99
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,520
也因為他不想被人找到
And because he doesn't want to be found.

100
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,050
我不覺得布萊特·斯特爾斯擔心是否會被找到
I doubt Bret Stiles is worried about being found.

101
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,690
你看起來很有信心
You seem confident.

102
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,960
這叫信仰
Call it faith.

103
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,450
斯特爾斯在我們這個
You see, Stiles' time

104
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,900
現實世界里的時間  是有限的
in our... reality is limited.

105
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,220
就在我們說話的這會
As we speak,

106
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,020
他正在做好心理和身體上的準備
he's preparing his mind and body

107
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,960
以擺脫我們這個物質世界的束縛
for a departure from the confines of our material world.

108
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,610
他要死了嗎
He's dying?

109
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,060
這是非常天真
That is a very naive,

110
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,340
非常無知的想法
very ignorant way of looking at it.

111
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,800
布萊特·斯特爾斯不會死
Bret Stiles is not dying.

112
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,350
他也不能死
Bret Stiles cannot die.

113
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,840
他是要將自己提升到一個新的高度
He is elevating himself to another plane,

114
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,800
我們這種道行不夠的
one lesser men like ourselves

115
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,200
要非常艱難才能觸碰到這種高度
can only strive to reach.

116
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,650
顯然我們中有人對此是無法理解的
And one some of us obviously can't comprehend.

Get his I.D. for me, will you?

122
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,730

You know how I am about heights.

123

Sure.

Oh, and, uh, someone's here to see you.

There's been a breakthrough in the Red John investigation.

127
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,680

I have some new information.

128
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,070

Some very significant information.

Okay. What is it?

130
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,340
不  現在還不能說
No, no. Not yet.

我甚至不知道能不能信任你
I'm not even sure I can trust you.

133
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,280
血腥約翰有一些位高權重的同伙
Red John has some very powerful allies.

134
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,350
派翠克  不是吧
Patrick, come on.

135
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,850
好吧  但不能在這說
Okay, but not here.

136
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,560
周四晚上八點見面
Meet me at 8:00 on Thursday night.

137
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,350
周四  為什么
Thursday? Why?

138
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,980
我需要時間找一個安全的見面地點
I need time to find a safe place to meet.

139
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,580
好吧  在哪見
Fine. Where?

140
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,200
等到了那天再告訴你
I'll let you know the day of.

141
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,880
太扯淡了
This is crazy.

142
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,120
我已經犯過很多次錯誤了
I've made the mistake of underestimating Red John

143
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,260
總是低估了血腥約翰
a number of times now.

144
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,020
我不想再犯這種錯誤了
I don't want to make that mistake again.

145
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,320
如果你想知道線索  就要聽我的
If you want the information, it's on my terms.

146
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,990
好吧
Okay.

你說話算數嗎
Did you mean what you said?

157
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,190
我覺得我是講信用的人
I like to think I'm a man of my word.

This is about Red John, isn't it?

169
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,990

將見證我升天

176
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,740
從這個世界  飛升到
My ascension from this world

177
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,680
一個世外的天地
to a world beyond.

178
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,770
不要為我哀悼  我的子民
Do not mourn me, my children,

179
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,770
因為這并非逝去
for this is not a passing,

180
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,670
而是啟程
but a departure.

181
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,120
我保證
And I promise...

Listen to me, Don, you don't have a mistresst.

You have a vindictive screwball who's about to ruin your life.

187
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,570

如果還沒完  也別擔心  唐
If it doesn't, don't worry, Don.

There are plenty of ways to keep a woman quiet, OK?

194

So why am I here at 8:00 a.m.?

201
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,340
我有個調查需要你的幫助
I need help with an investigation.

202
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,230
什么調查
What investigation?

203
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,630
這不重要
It's not important.

204
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,640
是么  如果你找我幫忙那這就很重要
Really? It is if you want my help.

我不能告訴你
I can't tell you.

206
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,570
得了吧  特蕾莎  我還不了解你嗎
Come on, Teresa. I know you better than that.

207
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,670
你和簡對血腥約翰的調查
What, you and Jane got something going on

208
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,140
有進展了吧
with the Red John case?

209
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,840
也許吧
Maybe.

210
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,690
"也許"  是啊
"Maybe." Yeah, right.

211
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,020
為什么要搞得這么神秘
What is with all the secrecy?

212
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,950
說真的  為什么要瞞著我
Seriously, why are you always holding out on me?

213
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,570
你們該不會覺得我是血腥約翰吧
You don't think I'm Red John, do you?

214
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,690
你們就是這么想的  是嗎
You do, don't you?

215
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,440
聽著
Tell you what.

216
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,400
你要想找我問話  那就逮捕我
You want to question me, you arrest me.

217
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,970
否則就別把我扯進來
Otherwise, you leave me the hell out of this.

If asking's not gonna work, I won't ask.

221
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,300
你已經不為加調局工作了
You're no longer with the CBI.

222
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,130
你現在無法得到執法人員所能得到的保護了
You don't get the same protection law enforcement gets.

223
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,290
-怎么  你威脅我  -不是我  是簡
- What, you threatening me? - No, Jane is.

他明天晚上想見你一面
He wants to see you tomorrow night.

225
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,710
你如果不去  他就會認為你是血腥約翰
If you don't show up, he will assume you're Red John.

226
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,770
然后他會找你麻煩的  雷
And, Ray, he will come after you.

227
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,760
你開玩笑吧
You gotta be kidding me.

228
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,790
你了解簡的  你知道他身上發生了什么
You know Jane. You know what happened to him.

229
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,840
你也知道血腥約翰對他做了些什么
You know what Red John did to him.

230
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,290
如果是我  我不會拿這個試探他
If I were you, I wouldn't test him.

231
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,170
我可不怕派翠克·簡
I'm not afraid of Patrick Jane.

232
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,290
那去和他見一面又有什么關系
Well, what's the problem with showing up?

233
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,860
我如果去了  你和簡
If I do this, will you and Jane drop

234
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,780
就不會再懷疑我是血腥約翰了嗎
the whole that "I'm Red John" business?

235
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,590
以后絕對不會了
For once and for all.

236

What time?

I don't want to arrest him. I just want to talk to him.

246
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,240
你幫我這個忙  算我欠你的
You do this, and I will owe you.

247

Maybe we can use that to our advantage.

285
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,440
有什么問題嗎
Is...there a problem?

286
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,020
-沒有  -沒有
- Uh, no. - No.

I know.

你在哪里
Where are you?

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,090
我就干點跑腿的活
Oh, just running some errands.

294
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,180
一切都好嗎
Everything okay?

295
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,070
好極了  有事嗎
Yeah, right as rain. What's up?

Haffner's in.

Good. What about Stiles?

She's checking it out now.

That leaves one more Red John suspect left to talk to.

Yes.

Oh, don't tell me you married that genial oaf.

你知道的
Ah...you know,

322
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,210
能見他我再高興不過了
nothing would please me more than to meet with him.

323
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,450
我真的很樂意  但是
I mean, really, I would love to. But...

324

很不幸的是  鑒于我現在的境況
unfortunately, my circumstances--

00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,870
好像不太能成行
it's probably not gonna happen.

326
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,630
你是說因為聯邦調查局嗎
You mean because of the F.B.I.?

327
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,360
你功課做得不錯嘛
Mm. You have been doing your homework.

328
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,920
他們不知道我來了
They don't know I'm here.

329
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,380
所以他們也就不知道你在這里
Which means they don't know you're here.

330
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,130
但你要是不肯見簡  他們就會知道了
But they will if you don't agree to meet with Jane.

331
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,350
你的確變了  不是嗎
You have changed, haven't you?

332
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,630
你去過厄瓜多爾嗎
Have you ever been to Ecuador, by any chance?

333

沒有
No.

334
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,040

在那傳教來著
doing missionary work. Uh...

那里的人很不錯
lovely people.

337

不過有個年輕人
But there was a young man there...

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,310
他很窮  但野心勃勃
he was underprivileged, ferociously ambitious.

339
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,280
我在他身上看到了些東西
I saw something in him.

340
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,870
所以我決定試著幫幫他
So I decided to try and help him.

341
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,720
我幫他付學費
You know, I-I paid for his school fees,

342
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,380
之類的
that sort of thing.

343
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,280
其實也沒什么  但你猜怎么著
N-nothing really much, but wouldn't you know it?

344
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,790
這么多年之后
All these years later,

345
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,510

that same man is now Minister of State.

346
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,200
我很為他高興
I'm happy for him.

347
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:50,230
他邀請我住在這豪華的領事館里
Anyway, he invited me to stay in this palatial consulate.

348
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,980
在這一片小小的外國領土上
This morsel of foreign soil.

349
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,770
外國領土  如你所知
Foreign soil, of which, as you know,

350
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:00,790
是不受你們加調局  聯調局
is outside the jurisdiction of you, the F.B.I.,

與任何美國法律管轄的
or U.S. law enforcement.

352
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,170
所以呢  格蕾斯  你的威脅不管用
So, you see, Gracie, your idle threats are just that.

353
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,490
當然  很高興能再見到你
Well, it's been so lovely seeing you again.

354
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,810
幫我跟簡問個好

Close the door on your way out!

沒事的
It's gonna be fine.

Thanks. I feel a lot better.

-什么案子  -血腥約翰案
- In... - The Red John case.

361

我們馬上就能確定兇手了
We're close to identifying him.

362
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,860
真是個好消息
Well, then this is fantastic news.

You really think you've got him?

365
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,990
是的
I do.

366
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,150
一旦你們有了切實答案要立刻告訴我
I'll know the second you have something concrete.

367
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,910
是的  長官
You will, sir.

368
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,530
此案結束的時候我要在場
And I want to be there when you end this.

369
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,720
就等您這句話呢
I was hoping you'd say that.

370
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,920
喂  是我
Yeah, it's me.

371
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,970
我剛和派翠克·簡談了點有趣的事
I just had a very interesting conversation with Patrick Jane.

372

How'd it go with Bertram?

373
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,930

He's in. What about Stiles?

374
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,940
-不太好  -你找到他了嗎
- Not so good. - Did you find him?

375
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,090
找到了
Yes.

376
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,520
那還有什么問題
Then what's the problem?

377
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,010
他住在厄瓜多爾領事館里
He's at the Ecuadorian consulate.

378
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,180
只要他在里面  我們就動不了他
As long as he's there, we can't touch him.

379
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,910
你打算怎么辦
What do you want to do?

380
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,670
我來對付斯特爾斯
I'll handle Stiles.

381
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,930
他不會也不必跟你出來
He's not gonna come with you. He doesn't have to.

382
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,420
相信我的說服力
I'll be persuasive.

383
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,970
那是什么
What is that?

384
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,900
霰彈槍
A shot gun?

385
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,200
火力夠大了嗎
You sure it's big enough?

386
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,850
關于明天晚上的事  我們得談談
We need to talk about tomorrow night.

00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,500
先聽我說完
Just hear me out, please.

389
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,820
你不希望我在場
You don't want me to be there.

390
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,660
是的
No, I don't.

391
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,270
你不希望我在場是因為你覺得
You don't want to be there because you think

392
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,910
我會阻止你殺血腥約翰
I'm gonna try and stop you from killing red john.

393
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,990
你的意思是你不會嗎
Are you saying that you won't?

394
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,670
我想說的是
What I'm saying is some men--

395
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,430
像血腥約翰這種禽獸
men like Red John--

396

根本連上庭受審的資格都沒有
they don't deserve a trial. They don't deserve a jury.

397
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,840
這種人就該就地正法
They deserve what they have coming to them.

398
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,260
等等  讓我搞搞清楚
Wait, l-let me get this straight.

399
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,240

After close to 20 years working in law enforcement,

400
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,570
竟然就這么改變原則了嗎
you're just-- you're changing your mind?

401
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,160
在血腥約翰案上嗎  沒錯
About Red John? Yes.

402
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,600
我很驚訝  里斯本
I'm surprised, Lisbon.

You're the most honest person I know.

406

這種事情上  你絕不會騙我的
You would never lie, not about something like this.

407
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,090
是不是
Right?

408

00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,170
這不是你的風格啊
That's so out of character.

423
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,680
我說的話句句當真
I mean every word of it.

424
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,220
確實
Yes.

425
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,930
我相信你
I believe you do.

426
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,460
可是派翠克
But you see, Patrick,

427
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,690
將死之人還怕什么死亡威脅呢
a dying man does not fear death.

428
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,750
省省吧
Oh, please.

429
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,860
裝模作樣騙騙你那些信徒還行
This charade might work on your disciples.

430
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,250
騙我就算了吧
It doesn't work on me.

431
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,010
你太高估我了
You think too highly of me.

432
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,510
非常不幸的是
Unfortunately,

433
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,860
這次不是裝的了
it's not a charade.

434
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,900
你還剩多長時間
How long have you got?

435
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,670
已經擴散到血液了
It's spread to the blood.

436
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,870
已經無藥可醫了  我不知道
There's nothing they can do. I don't know...

437
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,720
也許兩周  也許一個月
Two weeks, a month.

438
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,520
聽我說
You see...

439
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,680
這不是針對你
it's not personal.

440
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,230
只是現在
It's just that...

441
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,980
時間對我來說太寶貴了
my time now is very precious.

442
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,520
今晚我還是需要你來
I'm still gonna need you tonight.

443
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,960
看在上帝的份上  為什么
For god sake, why?

444
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,170
有什么事如此重要
What's so damned important?

445
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,780
血腥約翰
Red John.

446
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,420
我終于接近他了
I'm close.

447
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,770
前所未有的接近
Closer than I've ever been.

448
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,080
血腥約翰
Red John...

449
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,630
聽著
Look...

450
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,750
今晚我若能去見你
nothing would give me more pleasure

451
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,900
那是再高興不過了
than to be with you there tonight.

452
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,680
但是
But?

453
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,730
我的情況比你想象的復雜
There's more to this than you know.

454
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,230
我被困在這兒還有別的原因
There's--there's more keeping me here.

455
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,170
聯調局嗎
The F.B.I?

456
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,460
對  事實正是如此
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

457
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,980
他們跟我到這里
You know, they tracked me here.

458
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,390
就等著我出去
They're just waiting for me to leave

459
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,770
然后逮捕我
so they can arrest me.

460
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,060
不是我想呆在這兒的
Look, I'm not choosing to stay here,

461
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,540
我被困住了
but I'm trapped.

462
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,650
這么說聯調局是唯一的問題了
So the F.B.I's the only thing that's keeping you here?

463
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,860
注意  前門有動靜
Eyes up, we've got movement at the front entry.

464
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,180
是天眼組織的車
That's a Visualize car.

465
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,350
他們在偷偷往外轉移什么人
I think they're sneaking someone out.

466
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,250
隨時準備行動
Get ready to move.

467
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,040
立即行動  行動  上
Go now! Go! Go! Go!

468
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:33,900
-不許動  -不許動
- Don't move! - Don't move!

469
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,300
把手放在方向盤上
Hands on your steering wheel!

470
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,790
把手放在我們能看見的地方
Keep your hands where we can see 'em.

471
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,160
你們好  先生們
Hello. Gentlemen.

472
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,490
有什么能為你們效勞的嗎
Something I can help you with?

473
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,500
斯特爾斯入局了
Stiles is in.

474
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,190
我們該出發了
We'd better get going.

475
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,950
我們可有很長一段車程
We've got a long drive ahead of us.

476
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,160
把他帶走
Take him.

477
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,090
{\an8}晚上八點  馬里布  雪松街1309號見  走便道

478
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:42,760
{\an8}信息已發送

479
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,920
那么薩城警局只有等著了
Well, then Sac P.D.'s just gonna have to wait.

480
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,070
我不想用職權壓人
Look, I-I don't wanna pull rank...

481
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,040
但若有必要我會的
but I will.

482
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,030
凱文  回頭我再打給你
Kevin, I gotta call you back.

483
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,780
我需要一輛車
I'll be needing a car.

484
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,200
我們要去干什么
What are we doing?

485
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,230
我想看看日落
I want to see the sunset.

486
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,830
里斯本  有些話我想跟你說
There's something I want to tell you, Lisbon.

487
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,770
很早以前就應該跟你說了
Something I should have said a long time ago.

488
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,030
謝謝你做的一切
I want to thank you for everything that you've done.

489
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,220
晚點再謝也不遲
You can thank me later.

490
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,260
不
No, I...

491
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,360
我必須現在就說
I need to say this now.

492
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,570
你
You have...

493
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,480
不知道你對我意味著什么
no idea what you've meant to me.

494
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,440
你對我有多重要
What you mean to me.

495
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,130
謝謝你
Thank you.

496
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,910
差點忘了  我有個驚喜給你
I almost forgot. I have a surprise for you.

497
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,060
在這等我
Wait here.

498
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,620
簡

499
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,400
簡

停車
Hey! Stop!

503
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,470
請等等
Please.

504
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,070
我叫特蕾莎·里斯本
My name is Teresa Lisbon.

505
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,420
我是加州調查局探員
I am an agent with the California Bureau of Investigation,

506
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,720
現在我要征用你的車
and I need to borrow your car.

507
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,780
這是緊急情況
It's an emergency.

508
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,620
什么  不行
What?! No way.

509
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,290
立即下車  快
Get out. Now. Come on.

510
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,390
快
Come on.

511
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,800
太過分了
This is outrageous.

512
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,460
我要報警
I'm calling the police.

513
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,080
好主意  謝謝
Good idea. Thanks.

514
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,050
-簡  -喂  里斯本
- Jane. - Hello, Lisbon.

515
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,720
簡  別這么做  別扔下我這么做
Jane, don't do this, not without me.

516
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,840
對不起
Listen, I'm sorry.

517
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,480
簡  求你了  你身處險境
Jane, I am begging you. You're in danger!

518
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,990
沒事的
I-it's gonna be okay.

519
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,550
我不會有事的
I-I'm gonna be okay.

520
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,700
不可能
No, you're not.

521
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,870
你這樣做是在自尋死路
You do this, and you're throwing your life away.

522
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,730
再見  里斯本
Bye, Lisbon.

523
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,570
簡
Jane...

524
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,850
別這樣
No.

525
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,090
你好  派翠克
Oh. Hello, Patrick.

526
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,550
我來早了嗎
Am I early?

527
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,780
不早  來得正好  坐吧
No, no. Right on time. Have a seat.

528
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,630
911  您遇到了什么緊急情況
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

529
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,000
我是加州調查局的
This is Agent Teresa Lisbon

530
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,800
特蕾莎·里斯本探員
with the California Bureau of Investigation.

531
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,810
請派警員到馬里布的雪松街1309號
I need officers at 1309 Cedar Street in Malibu.

532
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,370
有探員需要立即支援
I have an agent who needs immediate assistance.

533
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,660
我讓你們五個聚在一起是有原因的
I brought you five together for a reason.

534
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,820
有人可能知道了
Some of you may know that reason.

535
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,600
也有人可能猜到了
Some of you may have guessed.

536
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,260
你們中的一個人
But one of you here...

537
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,370
是血腥約翰
is Red John.

538
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,940
什么  在我們幾個中間
What?! One of us?

539
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,170
我們其中之一是血腥約翰
One of us here is Red John?

540
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,480
真有意思
Well, that's very interesting.

541
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,780
-是誰  -我不知道
- Who is it? - I don't know.

542
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,380
我們到這來就是為了找出答案
And that's what we're gonna find out.

543
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,500
你是想說這個房間里的某個人
Wait, you're trying to say that one of us in this room...

544
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,670
是個連環殺手
is a serial killer?

545
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,070
-我很確定  -太荒唐了
- I know it. - No, this is crazy.

546
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,630
我向你保證完全不荒唐
I can assure you it's not.

547
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,630
我向你保證  我才不跟你在這兒胡鬧
Well, I can assure you I'm not sticking around for this crap.

548
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,320
坐下
Sit down.

549
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,350
一步都別想往門口走
Do not move toward the door.

550
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,910
誰都不準走
No one is leaving.

551
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,070
放輕松  派翠克
Take it easy, Patrick.

552
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,680
我看起來很緊張嗎
Do I look distressed?

553
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,270
別動
Don't.

554
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,740
我會開槍的
I will shoot you.

555
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,500
其他人也一樣
That goes for the rest of you as well.

556
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,420
慢慢把你們的槍拿出來  放在地上
Take out your weapons slowly, place them on the floor,

557
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,770
推到我這邊來
and push them toward me.

558
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,140
謝謝
Thank you.

559
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,660
謝謝
Thank you.

560
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,250
行了  派翠克
Okay, Patrick.

561
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,400
夠了
This is... this is enough.

562
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,950
該到此為止了
It's gone far enough.

563
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,130
不  這才剛剛開始呢
No, we're just getting started.

564
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,730
為這一刻  我等了十年

All those years, Red John has been smart.

566
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,620
你們中的某個人一直很狡猾

567
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,680
很謹慎  除了這次
Careful. But not this time.

568
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,500
這一次  你露出馬腳了
This time, you made a mistake.

569
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:38,060
基拉·汀斯利死之前跟我說了件事
Kira Tinsley told me something before she passed.

570
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:42,050
她告訴我殺她的人  也就是血腥約翰
She told me that her killer-- Red John--

571
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,420
有個紋身
has a tattoo.

572
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,310
左臂上有三個點

573
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,070
就在肩膀上
On the shoulder.

574
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,070
你們都得
And you all...

開始脫吧  快
Let's go. Come on.

578
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,860
對了  脫掉
That's it. Take it off.

579
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,140
太荒唐了
Nonsense.

580
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,910
很好
Very good.

581
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,510
不是你想得那樣
It's not what you think.

582
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,600
-你弄錯了  -住嘴
- You got it wrong. - Enough.

583
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,860
我不是血腥約翰
I'm not Red John.

584
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,940

You stay there.
