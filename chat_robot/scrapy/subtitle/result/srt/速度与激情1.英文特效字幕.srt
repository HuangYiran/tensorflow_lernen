00:13:18,643 --> 00:13:20,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Letty, I was just talkir. - Whatever.

103

105
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:27,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's up? - Edwin.

106

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How we doir this tonight? - One race.

107
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:33,418
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two-G buy-in. Winner takes all.

108
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:36,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hector, you're gonna hold the cash. - Why Hector?

109
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:38,452
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's too slow to make away with the money.

110
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:44,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good luck, guys. - Wait. Hold up.

111
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:48,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have any cash, but I do have the pink slip to my car.

112
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:51,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just can't climb in the ring with Ali 'cause you think you box.

113
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:54,778
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He knows I can box.

114
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:56,939
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So check it out. It's like this.

115
00:13:57,015 --> 00:14:00,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I lose, the winner takes my car, clean and clear.

116
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:04,018
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if I win, I take the cash, and I take the respect.

117
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:05,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Respect.

118
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To some people, that's more important.

119
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That your car?

120
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:19,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see a cool-air intake.

121
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:22,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's got a NOS-fogger system and a T-four turbo, Dominic.

122
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see an AIC controller.

123
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:27,309
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It has direct port nitrous injection.

124
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:31,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, and a stand-alone fuel management system.

125
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not a bad way to spend $10,000.

126
00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:38,612
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see that shit?

127
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:41,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got enough NOS in there to blow himself up, period.

128
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:44,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you say? Am I won'thy?

129
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,688
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't know yet. But you're in.

130
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

131
00:15:55,294 --> 00:15:57,228
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell's goir on around here?

132
00:15:57,296 --> 00:16:01,232
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Street's closed, pizza boy. Find another way home.

133
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goddamn street racers.

134
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:05,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Iog on 22, code three. Tension is high.

135
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:07,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've blocked the street.

136
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:55,085
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Edwin...

137
00:16:56,856 --> 00:17:00,314
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this is yours, whether you win or lose.

138
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:03,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you win, you get her too.

139
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:14,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna win.

140
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:17,333
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna win.

141
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,655
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had a reported homicide, 187, at Barakian liquor.

142
00:18:04,723 --> 00:18:07,783
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got a 187 in Glendale. Cops are all over it.

143
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're good to roll. I repeat, good to roll.

144
00:18:10,396 --> 00:18:12,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's race! - Right.

145

147
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:56,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn, that guy's fast.

148
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:06,609
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go! "Menage a"!

149

153
00:21:04,403 --> 00:21:06,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were racir a bunch of skateboards.

154
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:11,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My sister holds the money.

155

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Count it.

156

157
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:21,809
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Monica! What's up, baby?

158
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:24,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your problem, nigga? You didn't win.

159
00:21:26,658 --> 00:21:28,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck you, then!

160
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:44,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Was that fun? - Got a problem there, huh, buddy?

161
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:54,609
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you smilir about? - Dude, I almost had you.

162
00:21:57,387 --> 00:21:59,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You almost had me?

163
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:02,884
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never had me. You never had your car.

164
00:22:05,228 --> 00:22:08,925
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Granny shifting, not double-clutchir like you should.

165
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:13,435
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're lucky that hundred-shot of NOS didn't blow the welds on the intake.

166
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:16,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Almost had me?

167
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,979
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now me and the mad scientist gotta rip apart the block...

168
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:26,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and replace the piston rings you fried.

169
00:22:34,491 --> 00:22:36,618
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ask any racer, any real racer.

170
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:40,151
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile.

171
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Winning's winning.

172
00:22:49,172 --> 00:22:52,039
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Available units, we have reported street racing along Hawthorne...

173
00:22:52,108 --> 00:22:54,338
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit! We got cops!

174

176
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,934
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Toretto, stop right there!

177

00:25:45,682 --> 00:25:49,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought if I got in your good graces, you might let me keep my car.

180
00:25:49,118 --> 00:25:52,713
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are in my good graces, but you ain't keepir your car.

181
00:25:54,123 --> 00:25:56,785
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You drive like you've done this before. What are you, a wheel man?

182
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:00,695
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You boost cars?

183
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:04,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No. Never. - Ever done time?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couple of overnighters. No big deal.

185
00:26:07,537 --> 00:26:10,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the two years in juvie for boostir cars?

186

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So why bullshit?

197
00:27:50,006 --> 00:27:52,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stay away, I stay away.

00:28:05,555 --> 00:28:09,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So when are you gonna give me a shot at that Honda 2000 of yours?

204
00:28:09,258 --> 00:28:11,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This your ride? - It was. It's his now.

205
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:14,121
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's not. I haven't taken delivery.

206
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:19,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then it's nobody's car.

207
00:28:19,402 --> 00:28:21,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody put in the wrench time.

208
00:28:23,673 --> 00:28:27,769
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What do you think, Lance? - It's an amazing machine.

209
00:28:27,844 --> 00:28:29,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, indeed.

00:28:39,987 --> 00:28:41,784
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna need more than that crotch rocket.

214

00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:59,205
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell was that about?

216
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:02,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Long story. I'll tell you later. Let's get outta here.

00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what the hell was that all about?

219
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,881
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a long story.

220
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:50,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got a 20-mile hike. Humor me.

221
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:53,821
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A business deal that went sour.

222
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:56,954
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Plus, I made the mistake of sleepir with his sister.

223
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:30,758
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, Spilner.

225
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:37,228
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit.

00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:04,323
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were all there, right? Falling behind.

227
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:06,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- With all that nitrous. - Yeah.

00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where were you? - There were mass cops there.

230
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:28,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They came in from every direction. Their shit was orchestrated.

231
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:31,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This your beer? - Yeah, that's my beer.

232
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:36,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, Einstein. Take it upstairs.

233
00:31:37,131 --> 00:31:39,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't detail a car with the cover on.

234
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,291
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't even get that right.

235
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:43,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You all right?

236
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:47,299
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I all right?

237
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:49,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was just a question.

238
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:55,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, Dom! Why'd you bring the buster here?

239
00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:57,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause the buster kept me out of handcuffs!

240
00:31:57,418 --> 00:32:00,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He didn't just run back to the fort!

241
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:02,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The buster brought me back.

242
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:12,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can have any brew you want... as long as it's a Corona.

243
00:32:12,232 --> 00:32:15,258
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thanks, man. - That's Vince's, so enjoy it.

244
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:17,704

245
00:32:25,245 --> 00:32:27,179
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, bro, you got a bathroom?

246

00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got no call beir up in here.

248
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:50,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You don't know that fool for shit! - He's right, Dom.

249
00:32:50,104 --> 00:32:52,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vince, there was a time when I didn't know you.

250
00:32:52,873 --> 00:32:55,364
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was in the third grade!

251
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, so, what girls are here?

252
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:02,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You name it. You want mine? - You need to shut the f...

253
00:33:04,184 --> 00:33:06,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You don't have anything? - You look a bit tired.

254
00:33:06,887 --> 00:33:08,946
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you should go upstairs and give me a massage.

255
00:33:09,022 --> 00:33:10,614
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at all our guests.

256
00:33:10,691 --> 00:33:13,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about we go upstairs and you give me a massage?

257
00:33:16,563 --> 00:33:17,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crazy lady.

258
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:28,474
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know you owe me a ten-second car, right?

259
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,143
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ouch.

260
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:34,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit.

261
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:41,154
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you wipe the seat?

262
00:33:44,725 --> 00:33:47,489
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Jesus Christ! Would you cut the shit already?

263
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:48,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

264
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:53,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Let's go get me a drink.

265
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:56,202
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, man. We were just about to get along.

266
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:05,876
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So, what do you want? - Anything, long as it's cold.

267
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:10,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My brother likes you. He usually doesn't like anybody.

268
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:12,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, he's a complicated guy.

269
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:14,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? What about you?

270
00:34:17,324 --> 00:34:20,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm simpler. - You're a shitty liar.

271
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:23,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

272
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:28,061
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But there's a problem. - What's that?

273
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:30,865
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to get some sleep.

274
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:35,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you definitely, definitely need a shower.

275
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:38,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. I'll take you home.

276
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:03,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Show me your hands. Very good. Now open the door.

277
00:35:03,337 --> 00:35:06,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put your hands on your head. Behind your head.

278
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:10,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Face the front of the vehicle, walk backwards towards the rear.

279
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:13,905
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take two steps to your right. Stop right there.

280
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:18,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What'd I do?

281
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:21,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up. He's clean, Sarge.

282
00:35:31,932 --> 00:35:34,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn! Muse, will you take these things off?

283
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:37,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Shit. You put 'em on so tight. - I like realism.

284
00:35:37,237 --> 00:35:44,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You like realism. - You never know who's watching.

285
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:48,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice crib, Sergeant. It's a lot nicer than that last place you confiscated.

286
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:52,711
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ain't it? Eddie Fisher built this house for Elizabeth Taylor in the '50s.

287
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See? Even the cops are Hollywood in Hollywood.

288
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here he is, fresh from Toretto's hot rod heaven.

289
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:04,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was an $80,000 vehicle, officer.

290
00:36:04,528 --> 00:36:08,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wait. You tell him what happened? - He knows what happened.

291
00:36:08,198 --> 00:36:11,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Send the bill toJohnny Tran. - The kid's givir me attitude?

292
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:14,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That doesn't speak very well for police-FBI relations, Tanner.

293
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:17,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I walk in, the guy's already givir... - All right, all right.

294
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,305
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll talk, okay? Let's talk about it.

295
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:23,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Muse, why don't you make us four iced cappuccinos, please.

296
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:26,443
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on. - Regular or decaf, Sarge?

297
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:29,578
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Decaf, I think.

298
00:36:29,653 --> 00:36:32,523
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Four hijackings in two months, and we don't have anything.

299
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}DVD players and digital cameras alone are won'th a million-two...

300
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:38,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which brings the grand total to six million plus.

301
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're in the political crosshairs now, Brian.

302
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:43,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why you're undercover.

303
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:47,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want that detective badge fast, kid. And you wanna know something?

304
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:51,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The FBI can help, if you come through for us.

305
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:55,268
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What does the truck driver say? - He gave us the same M.O.

306
00:36:55,345 --> 00:36:57,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three Honda Civics, precision driving...

307
00:36:57,614 --> 00:37:00,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the same green neon glow from under the chassis.

308
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,445
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lab says the skid marks came back the same:

309
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,454
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mashamoto ZX tires.

310
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:08,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we know that it's somebody in the street racing world.

311
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:10,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't make this case soon...

312
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:12,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the truckers will take matters into their own hands.

313
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:15,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tell 'em we're close.

314
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,333
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gonna make me a liar?

315
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,335
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, what do we know?

316
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,065
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We all know this world revolves around Toretto, right?

317
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not sayir that he's necessarily the one that's poppir these trucks...

318
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I can guarantee the both of you that he knows who is.

319
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:30,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's just a matter of time until... - You want time?

320
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:33,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buy the magazine. We don't have time.

321
00:37:35,118 --> 00:37:37,313
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just get me something I can use.

322
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:40,513
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is Harry cooperating?

323
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:44,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, like a guy who's gonna do time for receiving stolen property if he doesn't.

324
00:37:44,494 --> 00:37:46,485
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of vibe is he getting from Toretto?

325
00:37:46,563 --> 00:37:49,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's scared of him, but he doesn't think he's jackir trucks in his spare time.

326
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,134
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's too controlled for that. - Wait.

327
00:37:52,202 --> 00:37:55,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not that I want to contradict Harry's fine judge of character...

328
00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:59,272
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but Toretto did hard time for nearly beating a guy to death.

329
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:02,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got nitrous oxide in his blood and a gas tank for a brain.

330
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,113
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not turn your back on him.

331
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,416
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Tanner. I'm gonna need another car.

332
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:07,383
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Tanner. I'm gonna need another car.

333
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:13,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about parts and service?

334
00:38:13,156 --> 00:38:15,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hold off on that. - What should I do with this?

335
00:38:19,863 --> 00:38:22,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, what the hell is this?

336
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:24,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you got there?

337
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is your car. - My car?

338
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:31,262
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said a ten-second car, not a ten-minute car.

339
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:35,402
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could push this across the finish line, or tow it.

340
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:38,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couldrt even tow that across the finish line.

341
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No faith.

342
00:38:41,518 --> 00:38:44,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have faith in you, but this isn't a junkyard.

343
00:38:44,187 --> 00:38:46,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is a garage. - Pop the hood.

344
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,253
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pop the hood? - Pop the hood.

345
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:52,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}TwoJZ engine.

346
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:55,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No shit. - And what did I tell you?

347
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:57,497
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I retract my previous statement. - You know what?

348
00:38:57,567 --> 00:39:02,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This will decimate all after you put about 15 grand in it...

349
00:39:02,272 --> 00:39:05,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or more, if we have to overnight parts from Japan.

350
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:08,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll put it on my tab at Harry's.

351
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:09,544
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

352
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:13,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta get you racing again so I can make some money off your ass.

353
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:17,843
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a show in the desert called Race Wars, and that's where you'll do it.

354
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:22,654
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell you what. When you're not workir at Harry's, you're workir here.

355
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:26,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you can't find the right tool in this garage, Mr. Arizona...

356
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:27,998
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you don't belong near a car.

357
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't belong near a car.

358
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:35,037
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He owns you now.

359
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:01,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me what you think about this.

360
00:40:01,994 --> 00:40:04,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Koni adjustables.

361
00:40:04,263 --> 00:40:06,493
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gonna save us about two pounds.

362
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:09,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they're gonna give us better traction for the hole shot.

363
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:11,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right?

364
00:40:11,804 --> 00:40:14,204
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is your basic layout of the car...

365
00:40:14,273 --> 00:40:18,801
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that's pretty much what it could look like when it's finished.

366
00:40:18,878 --> 00:40:20,812
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Red, green.

367
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, you should be goir to MIT or somethir.

368
00:40:23,082 --> 00:40:25,016
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, right.

369
00:40:25,084 --> 00:40:27,985
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I got that... Oh, what's it called?

370
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:32,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That attention disorder... - ADD?

371
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, that shit. Yeah.

372
00:40:36,195 --> 00:40:39,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I was good in algebra and, like, math...

373
00:40:39,098 --> 00:40:40,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and shit.

374
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,824
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything else I failed.

375
00:40:42,902 --> 00:40:45,769
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dropped out of school. I don't know.

376
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:48,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just somethir about engines...

377
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:52,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that calms me down, you know?

378
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:15,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm outta here. - Come on, dog.

379
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:18,364
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vince, get over here and give us a hand.

380
00:41:18,437 --> 00:41:20,769

381
00:41:35,354 --> 00:41:36,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mia! - All right already.

384
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:51,830

00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:43,071
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want somethir to show. Now, we have a top-echelon fence...

504
00:53:43,144 --> 00:53:45,578
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with a lube hose in his mouth, automatic weapons...

505
00:53:45,646 --> 00:53:48,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a jacket full of priors on every one of these Asian punks...

506
00:53:48,349 --> 00:53:51,648
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a garage full of DVD players and generally psychotic behavior.

507
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:55,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not move on Tran now, see where we are when the dust settles?

508
00:53:55,189 --> 00:53:58,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because all we have is behavior. Let me get some hard evidence...

509
00:53:58,292 --> 00:54:00,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because what we have now is circumstantial...

510
00:54:00,261 --> 00:54:01,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What we have is probable cause and truckers arming themselves...

511
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:06,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for some good old vigilante mayhem.

512
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell us about Hector.

513
00:54:08,169 --> 00:54:10,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Latinos with spear guns. Give me a break.

514
00:54:10,238 --> 00:54:12,468
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hector's still working on the engines for the cars...

515
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but the tires don't match.

516
00:54:14,242 --> 00:54:15,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will someone just give me a cigarette?

517
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:18,208
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get him a cigarette. - Don't get him a cigarette.

518
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:19,837
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I thought you quit. - Yeah, I did quit.

519
00:54:19,914 --> 00:54:21,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Just give me a cigarette. - Get him a cigarette.

520
00:54:25,253 --> 00:54:29,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Tell me about Toretto. - He's too controlled for this.

521
00:54:29,857 --> 00:54:32,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, what? Going suicidal on semi trucks? No way.

522
00:54:32,226 --> 00:54:34,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, maybe his buddy Vince, but he's too stupid to pull it off.

523
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think the kid sister's blurring your vision.

524
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,423
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What do you say? - I don't blame you.

525
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,333
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd get off on her surveillance photos too, buddy.

526
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:49,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Knock it off. What? Are you going native on me, Brian?

527
00:54:54,415 --> 00:54:57,043
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you read Toretto's file lately?

528
00:54:57,118 --> 00:54:59,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. I memorized that file. - Yeah, well, read it again.

529
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,645
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Better still. Take a look at these.

530
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:06,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember I told you about the guy he nearly beat to death?

531
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:11,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Toretto did this with a 3/4-inch torque wrench.

532
00:55:11,165 --> 00:55:14,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a model of self-control.

533
00:55:16,504 --> 00:55:18,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need a few more days.

534
00:55:20,808 --> 00:55:21,776
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need a few more days.

535
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:22,743
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need a few more days.

536
00:55:28,015 --> 00:55:31,951
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What it's gonna do is it's gonna spool up.

537
00:55:32,019 --> 00:55:34,214
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got this set up for 24 psi.

538
00:55:37,892 --> 00:55:39,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got big plans tonight?

539
00:55:41,996 --> 00:55:44,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. We're going out to dinner.

540
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,464
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You break her heart, I'll break your neck.

541
00:55:48,836 --> 00:55:51,361
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not gonna happen.

542
00:55:55,543 --> 00:55:57,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna show you something.

543
00:56:07,488 --> 00:56:08,921
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow.

544
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:13,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me and my dad built her.

545
00:56:14,095 --> 00:56:19,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}900 horses of Detroit muscle. It's a beast.

546
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:22,465
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Know what she ran in Palmdale? - No. What did she run?

547
00:56:22,537 --> 00:56:24,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nine seconds flat.

548
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- God. - My dad was driving.

549
00:56:28,109 --> 00:56:32,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So much torque the chassis twisted coming off the line.

550
00:56:33,648 --> 00:56:36,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Barely kept her on the track.

551
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:39,219
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So what's your best time? - I've never driven her.

552
00:56:39,287 --> 00:56:40,379
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not?

553
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,421
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Scares the shit out of me.

554
00:56:47,562 --> 00:56:53,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my dad. He was coming up in the pro stock car circuit.

555
00:56:53,401 --> 00:56:55,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last race of the season.

556
00:56:55,870 --> 00:57:01,206
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A guy named Kenny Linder came up from inside in the final turn...

557
00:57:01,275 --> 00:57:04,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and clipped his bumper and put him into the wall at 120.

558
00:57:07,915 --> 00:57:10,748
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I watched my dad burn to death.

559
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,311
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remembered hearing him scream.

560
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:22,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The people that were there said he had died before the tanks blew.

561
00:57:29,036 --> 00:57:31,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They said it was me who was screaming.

562
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:37,537
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw Linder about a week later.

563
00:57:38,613 --> 00:57:42,413
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had a wrench, and I hit him.

564
00:57:42,483 --> 00:57:44,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I didn't intend to keep hitting him...

565
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:47,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but by the time I was done, I couldn't lift my arms.

566
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a janitor at a high school.

567
00:57:56,063 --> 00:57:58,657
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Has to take the bus to work every day.

568
00:57:59,734 --> 00:58:03,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they banned me from the tracks for life.

569
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:10,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I live my life a quarter-mile at a time.

570
00:58:12,446 --> 00:58:15,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing else matters... not the mortgage, not the store...

571
00:58:15,249 --> 00:58:18,343
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not my team and all that bullshit.

572
00:58:19,553 --> 00:58:22,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For those ten seconds or less...

573
00:58:23,557 --> 00:58:25,286
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm free.

574
00:58:45,546 --> 00:58:48,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how is it, anyways, that the gang came to be?

575
00:58:49,016 --> 00:58:50,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - The gang.

576
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,878
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The gang? No, they don't call themselves a gang.

577
00:58:52,953 --> 00:58:55,114
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What do they call themselves? - They're a team.

578
00:58:55,189 --> 00:58:58,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They call themselves a team. - How is it the team came to be?

579
00:58:59,694 --> 00:59:01,855
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that's a whole lot of history.

580
00:59:03,097 --> 00:59:05,429
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got time.

581
00:59:05,499 --> 00:59:07,763
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vince grew up with my brother.

582
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:11,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He didn't ever actually grow up, as you can tell.

583
00:59:11,672 --> 00:59:15,904
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they were friends as kids. And Letty, she lived down the street.

584
00:59:15,976 --> 00:59:19,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Always into cars, though, ever since she was ten years old.

585
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:23,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, naturally, my brother always had her attention.

586
00:59:23,551 --> 00:59:27,681
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And then she turned 16... - And then she had Dom's attention.

587
00:59:27,755 --> 00:59:31,418
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Yeah, it's funny how that works, isn't it?

588
00:59:31,492 --> 00:59:32,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

589
00:59:36,163 --> 00:59:38,256
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How is it thatJesse fits into the whole thing?

590
00:59:39,467 --> 00:59:42,334
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Jesse and Leon just sort of showed up one night...

591
00:59:42,403 --> 00:59:44,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and never ever left.

592
00:59:44,705 --> 00:59:47,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just the way my brother is. Dom's like...

593
00:59:49,276 --> 00:59:51,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's like gravity.

594
00:59:52,346 --> 00:59:54,576
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything just gets pulled to him.

595
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,911
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even you.

596
01:00:03,124 --> 01:00:05,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only thing that pulled me in was you.

597
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,292
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Being friends with your brother is just a bonus.

598
01:00:11,665 --> 01:00:13,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's good.

599
01:00:15,136 --> 01:00:19,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's good. That's nice to come first every once in a while.

600
01:00:22,443 --> 01:00:23,933
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna go for a drive?

601
01:01:01,982 --> 01:01:04,177
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah? - The hijackers have hit again.
