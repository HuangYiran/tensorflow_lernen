东区女巫前情回顾...
Previously on Witches of East End...

2
00:00:01,799 --> 00:00:03,177
- 那个 我叫温迪 - 利奥
- I'm Wendy, by the way. - Leo.

3
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:05,360
我叫利奥 有样东西你肯定感兴趣
My name's Leo. I got something you're gonna love.

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,093
等一下 你是准备不告而别?
Wait. You were just gonna go without saying good-bye?

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,554
- 我觉得你在等我 - 没有啊
- I feel like you're waiting for me. - I'm not waiting.

6
00:00:12,397 --> 00:00:14,727
我爱你 阿奇博尔德
I love you, Archibald.

7
00:00:14,737 --> 00:00:17,375
我知道你和阿奇博尔德的事 他才不关心你
I know about you and Archibald. He doesn't care about you.

8
00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:19,874
- 他在利用你 - 为什么你要撒这种谎?
- He's using you. - Why are you lying like this?

9
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:22,076
你也许能骗得了她 阿奇博尔德 
You may have fooled her, Archibald, 

10
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:23,377
但是我知道你想干嘛
but I know exactly what you're up to.

11
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:25,855
- 金造螺球! - 不!
- Pila metalli! - No!

12
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:28,482
我要把你千刀万剐!
I'll kill you as many times as it takes!

13
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:33,918
- 我很抱歉 - 你杀了我爸爸
- I'm sorry. - You killed my father.

14
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,232
你和你的家人对我意义重大
You and your family mean so much to me.

15
00:00:40,463 --> 00:00:42,921
我已经为你计划好了
I have big plans for you.

16
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,626
天哪 等等
Oh, my God. Wait.

17
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,694
英格丽德...
Ingrid...

18
00:01:10,728 --> 00:01:12,862
怎么说我都是你姨妈
I'm still your aunt.

19
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:15,490
你还是我侄女
You're still my niece.

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
你不该这样子
This isn't who you are.

21
00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:20,704
事实上...
Actually...

22
00:01:20,738 --> 00:01:23,473
我觉得这才是真正的我
I think this is exactly who I am.

23
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:24,974
不
No.

24
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:26,710
夺命掏心!
Acidum adere!

25
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,410
东区女巫 第一季第07集


26
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:43,691
我还以为你回家了呢
Oh, I thought you went home.

27
00:01:43,726 --> 00:01:46,995
我会让你一个人整理仓库么
Like I'd let you finish inventory by yourself.

28
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:50,535
你对我的评价可不怎么样 对吧?  
You do not think much of me, do you?  

29
00:01:50,536 --> 00:01:51,567
我拒绝回答
I am not gonna answer that.

30
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:55,857
- 里面真热 - 是啊 罗杰一直不修火炉
- It is hot in here. - I know. Roger refuses to fix the furnace.

31
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:57,378
我一直在和他纠结这个呢 
I keep bugging him about it.  

32
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:58,519
要我去和他说说吗?
Want me to bug him?

33
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:01,902
人家说我很擅长烦人的
I've been told I am very good at bugging people.

34
00:02:01,937 --> 00:02:04,172
我也能作证
I can vouch for that.

35
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,578
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

36
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:14,260
对不起
Sorry.

37
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:17,307
有时候我会忘记  
Sometimes I forget.  

38
00:02:17,308 --> 00:02:19,372
你... 会忘记什么?
You... forget what?

39
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:33,800
基利安...
Killian...

40
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:36,136
弗雷娅? 弗雷娅?
Freya? Freya?

41
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,305
什么事? 怎么了? 发生了什么?
What? What? What's going on?

42
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,744
你吵醒我了 你像条鱼似的翻来覆去
Oh, you woke me up. You're flopping around like a fish.

43
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,713
我肯定是做恶梦了
Oh. I must have been having a bad dream.

44
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:48,082
是啊 你一直在说梦话
Well, you were talking a lot.

45
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:50,184
我说了什么?
What was I saying?

46
00:02:50,218 --> 00:02:52,419
我不知道 很难理解 但是...
I don't know, I could barely understand, but...

47
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:55,255
肯定是在呻吟
There was definitely some moaning.

48
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,391
其实 听起来还蛮性感的
Actually, it sounded kind of sexy.

49
00:02:57,425 --> 00:03:00,175
额 不好意思 我一直这样
Oh, I'm sorry. I've always done this.

50
00:03:00,176 --> 00:03:02,395
我小的时候 英格丽德曾经在大半夜
When I was a kid, Ingrid used to bang on the wall

51
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:05,020
捶着墙壁叫我闭嘴
in the middle of the night and tell me to shut up.

52
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:09,269
好吧 我... 清楚地记得你说梦话
Well, I am... well aware of your sleep talk.

53
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:13,540
你第一次说爱我 就是在你睡着的时候
Oh, the first time you said you loved me, it was in your sleep.

54
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:17,877
- 你从没和我说过呢 - 我不想你尴尬
- You never told me that. - I didn't want to embarrass you.

55
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:20,914
你知道我从不为任何事尴尬的
You know I don't get embarrassed about anything.

56
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:23,182
好吧 也许是我有点尴尬
Okay, maybe I was embarrassed.

57
00:03:23,217 --> 00:03:24,870
我... 我... 
I... I... '

58
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,020
因为虽然我不知道这算不算数
Cause even though I didn't know if it counted,

59
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:28,621
但是我也说我爱你了
I said it back.

60
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:30,790
算数
It counted.

61
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:32,692
你梦到了什么?
What were you dreaming about?

62
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:34,597
我不知道 不记得了  
I don't know. I don't remember.  

63
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:35,958
一点都不记得了?
Nothing at all?

64
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:38,632
我一向不记梦的
I just don't remember my dreams.

65
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,967
也许下次我该靠近点听
Maybe I should listen a little closer next time,

66
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:43,603
看看我能不能自己听出来
see if I can figure it out for myself.

67
00:03:49,806 --> 00:03:52,221
我要去上班了
I gotta get to work.

68
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:09,765
哇 怎么了?
Whoa. What's going on?

69
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:12,546
你知道我会说梦话的吧?
You know how I have that whole sleep-talking thing?

70
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:14,866
- 是啊 - 我昨天晚上把达什吵醒了
- Yeah. - Well, I woke Dash up last night,

71
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:16,735
我正在做着跟基利安有关的梦
and I was in the middle of a dream with Killian.

72
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,350
他听到你说基利安的名字了?  
And he heard you say Killian's name?  

73
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:19,088
感谢上帝 没有
No, thank God,

74
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:21,072
不过这样下去他早晚会听到
but it's only a matter of time before he does.

75
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:23,307
最糟糕的是 我醒着的时候根本
And the worst part is, I don't even think about Killian

76
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:26,010
就没想过基利安 但是睡着了就会梦到他
when I'm awake, but sleep Freya hasn't gotten the memo.

77
00:04:26,044 --> 00:04:29,364
- 不太好啊 - 是啊
- Oh, that is not good. - No.

78
00:04:29,813 --> 00:04:32,148
我最不希望达什通过我的梦话
The last thing I need is Dash figuring out what happened

79
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:35,165
知道我和基利安之间的事
between me and Killian because I scream it out in my sleep.

80
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,096
你和基利安之间有什么事?
What happened between you and Killian?

81
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:43,503
- 我们接吻了 - 什么?!
- We kissed. - What?!

82
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:45,148
你说过你有感觉有欲望 
You said you had feelings and desires, 

83
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:46,931
可这事儿是什么时候发生的?
but when?

84
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:49,731
- 在我的订婚典礼上 - 弗雷娅...!
- Um, at my engagement party. - Oh, Freya...!

85
00:04:49,732 --> 00:04:52,474
我一做就知道错了 我当场逃走了
I knew it was a mistake the second I did it; I ran out instantly.

86
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:55,712
想不到你竟然没告诉我 你什么都告诉我的
I can't believe you didn't tell me this. You tell me everything.

87
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:58,348
我不想你批判我
I didn't want you to judge me.

88
00:04:58,427 --> 00:05:00,746
- 你真的觉得我会批判你? - 是啊
- You really think I would judge you? - Yeah.

89
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:02,066
好吧 也许以前会 
Fine. Maybe, once upon a time, 

90
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:04,120
但是在我经历了那么多事情以后
but after all that I've been through,

91
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,152
我再也没有资格批判任何人
I am in no position to judge anyone ever again,

92
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:09,188
特别是你
especially not you

93
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:11,490
不过是一念之差 我做的事更过分
for a momentary slip. I've done worse.

94
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:14,674
我猜你不打算告诉达什喽?
And I assume telling Dash the truth is not an option?

95
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:17,396
没门 他永远不会发现的
No way. He can't ever, ever find out.

96
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,610
好吧 好吧 
Okay, okay. So, 

97
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:21,563
这本书里有一个关于控制梦的部分
there is an entire section on dream control in this book

98
00:05:21,564 --> 00:05:22,959
有一个咒语
where you can come up with a spell.

99
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,195
我们只需要一束头发
And we are just going to need a bunch of hair,

100
00:05:25,196 --> 00:05:27,957
- 好的 - 一些生姜和茴香种子
- Okay. - Some ginger and some anise seeds.

101
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:29,399
基利安的头发?
Killian’s hair?

102
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:31,875
呼! 都置办好了
Whew! That's taken care of.

103
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:34,554
- 你好 英格丽德 - 你好
- Hey, Ingrid. - Hey.

104
00:05:37,676 --> 00:05:40,614
- 她怎么了? - 我不知道
- What is wrong with her? - I don't know.

105
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:42,515
她清除掉那面墙了?
Did she get rid of the wall?

106
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:45,751
是的 我和你妈妈早上溜进了费尔黑文的墓地
Yes. Your mother and I snuck into the catacombs at Fair Haven

107
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:49,229
消除了枝毒的痕迹
and managed to erase all traces of ramus mortium early this morning.

108
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,541
控制梦? 这是个大咒语
Dream control? It's a big spell.

109
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:55,362
都准备好了?
Everything okay?

110
00:05:57,656 --> 00:06:00,209
不 不 没呢 还没
No, no, it's not. Not really.

111
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:04,347
好吧 告诉姨妈你需要什么
Okay, tell your aunt Wendy how she can help.

112
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:06,360
你能解读我的卡片吗?
Can you read my cards?

113
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:09,999
塔罗牌和显灵板不一样 弗雷娅 
Tarot is not like Ouija, Freya. 

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,531
你不能只是问问题
You can't just ask it questions.

115
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:13,461
它只显示它想显示的东西 
It reveals what it wants to reveal. 

116
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:15,390
还有 我不喜欢为家人占卜
Besides, I don't like reading for family.

117
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:16,410
帮帮忙 求你了 
Oh, come on, please? 

118
00:06:16,411 --> 00:06:18,832
我们可以在明天图书馆活动结束以后做
We could do it after that library event tomorrow.

119
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:22,429
- 你去吗? - 是啊 当然
- You are going? - Yeah. Of course.

120
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,709
是啊 为什么不去呢? 
Yeah. What? 

121
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,451
有钱人 免费食物 开放式酒吧...
Rich men, free food, open bar...

122
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,421
我会早点到的... 相当早
I'll be there early... ish.

123
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:30,902
告诉我
Tell me something,

124
00:06:30,903 --> 00:06:33,670
要是我告诉你我的内心有黑暗面 
if I told you there was a darkness inside of me, 

125
00:06:33,671 --> 00:06:34,778
你会怎么说?
what would you say?

126
00:06:34,804 --> 00:06:38,132
英格丽德 你是我见过的最正统 
Ingrid, you are the most proper, 

127
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,464
最守规矩的人
rule-abiding person I know.

128
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:43,602
我是说 你从图书馆拿本书回家都要正规登记
I mean, you won't even take a library book home without officially checking it out.

129
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:46,446
才不是呢 好吧 是这样的...
That is not true. Okay, fine, it is...

130
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:50,789
但是有句话说你不能凭封面来评价书的
But there's a reason they say you can't judge a book by its cover.

131
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:53,376
等等 我们指的是真正的书吗?
Wait, are we still talking about actual books?

132
00:06:53,377 --> 00:06:54,584
你好
Hi.

133
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:56,392
你好 欢迎来到东区图书馆 
Hi. Welcome to the East End library. 

134
00:06:56,393 --> 00:06:57,505
我能帮你什么吗?
How can I help you?

135
00:06:57,531 --> 00:06:59,234
能帮我找到尽可能多的这类书
Can you find as many of these books as possible 

136
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,675
然后放到我桌子上来吗?
and bring them to my table?

137
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,679
- 当然 可能会花点时间 - 尽量快点
- Uh, sure. It may take a few minutes. - Just make it sooner rather than later.

138
00:07:05,473 --> 00:07:07,023
喂
Hey.

139
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:09,617
你不能像是对待你的仆人一样对别人
You can't just treat people like your servants.

140
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:12,053
你要是想要那些书 自己去找吧
If you want these books, you can find them yourself.

141
00:07:12,054 --> 00:07:14,390
我还以为图书管理员会很乐于助人的
I thought librarians were supposed to be helpful.

142
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:16,257
是的 不过要看那个人配不配
We are, when people deserve it.

143
00:07:16,258 --> 00:07:19,260
- 好吧 我明白了 - 你明白什么了?
- Oh. I get it. - You get what?

144
00:07:19,294 --> 00:07:21,930
你 我打赌你以前是纠察队长 是吧?
You. I'll bet you were a hall monitor, weren't you?

145
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:24,874
你当了图书管理员是因为你就会唬人...
And you became a librarian because you just live to shush peop...

146
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:28,144
听着 伙计 你一点都不了解我
Listen, buddy, you don't know anything about me.

147
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:29,597
- 我很了解 - 真的吗?
- I know enough. - Oh, really?

148
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:31,417
你以为在图书馆大声喧哗
Because you're the kind of guy who thinks

149
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,939
就是造反分子就是破坏规矩
yelling in the library makes you a rebel

150
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:35,474
其实只会显得你自以为是
and a rule breaker when it really just makes you a smug,

151
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:37,310
缺乏体谅 傲慢无礼...
inconsiderate, disrespectful...

152
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:39,980
我们到这里来吧
And we are moving over here.

153
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:42,349
也许你比我想象的要黑暗一点呢
Maybe you're a little darker than I thought.

154
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:52,804
嘿 你要为你妈妈去参加图书馆活动吗?
Hey, are you going to this library thing for your mom?

155
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:54,272
你好啊
Hello to you, too.

156
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:57,308
我当然要去 你觉得我有的选?
Of course I'm going; You think I have a choice?

157
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,074
怎么了? 你在看什么? 
What? What are you looking at?  

158
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:02,337
你的头发...
Your hair...

159
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:03,255
你已经下班了 
Do you actually mean for it to look like that 

160
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:05,221
你不是特意把头发弄成这样的吧?
when you leave for the day?

161
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:07,153
什么?
Excuse me?

162
00:08:07,157 --> 00:08:08,989
我是说 你头发这么乱 
I'm saying, this whole messy thing, 

163
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,655
不是故意弄的 是吧?
it can't really be a plan, right?

164
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:12,290
我当然没有故意弄头发
Of course I don't have a plan for my hair.

165
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:13,991
我不知道你什么意思
I don't even know what that means.

166
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,060
好吧 我觉得你要剪个头
Well, I think you could use a haircut,

167
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:18,047
而且我肯定佩内洛普会乐意的
and I'm pretty sure Penelope would appreciate it.

168
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:19,264
我真的没空
Well, I really don't have time.

169
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,237
事实上你有空 因为你运气不错 
Actually, you do, because luckily, 

170
00:08:21,238 --> 00:08:22,289
我对剪头发很拿手
I am very talented at cutting hair.

171
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,502
在高中的时候我经常帮我朋友剪
I used to do all my friends' hair in high school.

172
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:26,337
这是我众多天赋之一
It's one of my many gifts.

173
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:28,472
- 但我不想剪啊 - 我才不管
- But I don't want a haircut. - I don't care.

174
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,174
走
Let's go.

175
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,675
好嘞
Okay.

176
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:33,760
别太短了 好吗? 
Not too short, okay?  

177
00:08:33,761 --> 00:08:36,039
放松 一点都不会痛的
Relax. It's not gonna hurt at all.

178
00:08:36,636 --> 00:08:38,971
嘿 别动
Hey. Stay still.

179
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,722
天哪 这里就像是在蒸桑拿
Man, it's like a sauna in here.

180
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,857
我知道 我一直在叫罗杰修炉子
I know. I keep asking Roger to fix the furnace.

181
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:50,366
要我去说一下吗? 大家都说我很会烦人的
Want me to bug him for you? I hear I'm very good at bugging people.

182
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:53,998
- 你说什么? - 我很会烦人
- What did you say? - I'm good at bugging people.

183
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,722
怎么啦?
What?

184
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,103
没事
Nothing.

185
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:01,835
你还好吧?
You okay?

186
00:09:01,836 --> 00:09:04,331
我很好啊 怎么啦?
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

187
00:09:04,332 --> 00:09:06,610
你似乎在担心什么事
You seem worried about something.

188
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:08,746
你有心事的时候就是那个表情
You do that thing with your face when you're worried.

189
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,120
我没什么表情啊  
I don't do a thing with my face.  

190
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:11,459
你现在就是那个表情
You're doing it right now.

191
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,696
我在你后面... 你看不到我的表情
I'm behind you... You can't see my face.

192
00:09:13,722 --> 00:09:16,776
但是我感觉的到 这是我的天赋... 
But I can sense it. It's one of my gifts... 

193
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:17,625
我很了解你
I can read you like a book.

194
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:19,142
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

195
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,459
过来
Come here.

196
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:36,285
各位
Hey, guys.

197
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:39,822
艾米 你好 我来把这儿收拾干净
Amy. Hi. Let me just help clean up in here.

198
00:09:39,823 --> 00:09:42,691
别 别 不用 我来吧 等会我出去找你们
No, no, no, I got it. I'll just see you out there.

199
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:04,133
消亡之梦的碎片
Delens somnium meum hominis.

200
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:08,638
希望这个能有用
Oh, I hope this works.

201
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,660
你还好吗?
You okay?

202
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,705
我想你现在一定感到很困惑
I bet you must be feeling awfully confused right now.

203
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:42,991
我加入了邪教
I was in a cult.

204
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:45,845
就要跟阿奇博尔德・布朗宁结婚的时候 
I was about to marry Archibald Browning. 

205
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:46,523
温迪杀了我
Wendy killed me.

206
00:10:46,524 --> 00:10:49,226
我记得所有这些事 仿佛是昨天发生的
And I remember all of this like it was yesterday.

207
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:52,016
- 我感到的不仅仅是困惑 - 什么意思?
- Confused doesn't even begin to cover it. - What do you mean?

208
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,385
我知道弗雷娅和我总是年纪轻轻就去世了
I know that Freya and I always die young.

209
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:58,056
- 你怎么会这么想? - 妈妈!
- Oh, where do you come up with this? - Mom, please!

210
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,927
我看了所有的照片 
I can see all of these pictures, 

211
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:02,786
但是我们从没有变老过 从没有
but we are never old, ever.

212
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:07,532
所以我的看法是 我们总是在这个年纪死去
So my theory is, it's because we always die around now.

213
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:10,452
- 好吧 - 天呐
- Okay. - Oh, my God.

214
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:12,403
- 是的 你说的对 - 我不敢相信
- Yeah, you're right. - I can't believe this.

215
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,947
- 但是... - 但是什么
- But... - But what?

216
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:19,398
这次的情况完全不同
This life is completely different.

217
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:21,862
你们从没有活得这么长过 
You guys have never lived this long before, 

218
00:11:21,863 --> 00:11:23,915
我可以保证你们的安全
and I have kept you safe.

219
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,574
这是我的责任 而且
That's my job, and

220
00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:28,720
你不需要担心这些 因为你的任务
you don't need to worry, because your job

221
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:33,215
就是尽情地享受生活...
is to live your life to the fullest...

222
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:48,948
醒来
Wake up.

223
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:52,607
母亲...
Mother...

224
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:58,439
我不是你母亲 你认识我 我是雅典娜
I'm not your mother. You knew me as Athena.

225
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,276
欢迎回来 英格丽德 我好想你
Welcome back, Ingrid. I missed you.

226
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:13,033
英格丽德躲着我 弗雷娅要我读她的牌
Ingrid is avoiding me, and Freya asked me to read her cards.

227
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:14,534
那就去呀
Ugh! So do it.

228
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:18,104
- 但是我不能说给她听 - 那就别去了
- Well, I can't just read them to her. - Don't do it.

229
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,675
我也不知道该怎么办 温迪
I don't know anymore, Wendy.

230
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:23,669
如果结果显示她英年早逝了呢?
What if it reveals she dies young?

231
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,995
你不想她这样知道这件事 不是吗?
You don't want her to find out that way, do you?

232
00:13:25,996 --> 00:13:28,216
是的 但是她也许会通过其他方式知道
No, but she might figure it out anyhow.

233
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,498
- 嗯 你说的对 - 她有预言的天赋
- Yeah, I guess you're right. - With her gift of premonition.

234
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:34,383
英格丽德知道了 她有点生气
Ingrid found out. She's mad.

235
00:13:34,384 --> 00:13:37,290
所以她才这么诡异吗?!
Oh. Is that why she's acting so weird?!

236
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,493
当然了 还有其他事
Yeah, among other things.

237
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,221
她也知道了那次是你杀死了她
She also found out about the time you killed her.

238
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,056
什么?
What?

239
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,326
我给你这个是让你来浇水的 是吧?
I gave you that so that you could help water, right?

240
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,994
浇水
Aspergo.

241
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,496
她是怎么知道的?
How did she find out?

242
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,933
你认为呢? 她编了一个咒语
How do you think? She cooked up a spell.

243
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:58,355
关于早逝的事你是怎么跟她说的?
What did you tell her about the whole dying-young thing?

244
00:13:58,356 --> 00:14:01,241
我本想告诉她待在屋里
I wanted to tell her to stay in her room,

245
00:14:01,242 --> 00:14:03,025
关上窗户 让我保护她
shut the blinds, let me keep her safe,

246
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:07,046
但是却告诉她要活在当下
but instead I told her that she should seize the moment while she can.

247
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,090
当你不知道自己还剩多少时间的时候
When you don't know how much time you have left,

248
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:12,093
就要抓住现在的每分每秒 不是吗?
you want to make the most of every second, right?

249
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,204
是啊
Yeah.

250
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,360
- 我还活着吗? - 不算是
- Am I alive? - Not quite.

251
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:30,766
这下好了 现在...
There. Now...

252
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,668
这至少可以保持一两天
That should hold, at least for a day or two.

253
00:14:33,703 --> 00:14:35,704
我为什么在这儿?
Why am I here?

254
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:38,573
你的姨妈温迪偷了
Your aunt Wendy stole something

255
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:41,743
我父亲阿奇博尔德的东西 也就是你的爱人
from my father Archibald, the man you loved,

256
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:44,245
你愿意誓死保护的人
and the man you died trying to protect.

257
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,448
- 我要把它拿回来 - 什么东西?
- And I need it back. - What is it?

258
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,885
它叫巨蛇座
It's called serpens clavem.

259
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,587
是一只金色的蛇
It's a golden snake.

260
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:54,856
它的尾巴看起来像一把钥匙
The tail looks like a key.

261
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:57,092
我要你把它拿回来
I need you to get it back for me.

262
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:58,860
你可以完成的
You can do this for me.

263
00:14:58,894 --> 00:15:02,033
我要你设法让温迪单独跟你在一起 
I want you to get Wendy alone, 

264
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,799
说服她把东西交出来
and convince her to give it back.

265
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:07,637
作为回报 你可以杀了你姨妈
In return, you can kill your aunt,

266
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:11,407
就像多年前她杀了你一样
the one who murdered you all those years ago.

267
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:23,231
嗨 利奥
Hi, Leo.

268
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:26,724
你在这儿做什么? 你怎么知道我在这儿?
What are you doing here? How did you even find me?

269
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:29,127
我自有我的办法
I have my ways.

270
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:34,157
我最近一直在想你 很想你
Um, I've been thinking about you lately, a lot, actually.

271
00:15:34,178 --> 00:15:36,980
搞笑 自从你扮成我的邻居 睡了我
That's funny, seeing as how I never heard from you again

272
00:15:37,014 --> 00:15:38,714
还偷了我最自豪的蝴蝶以后
after you pretended to be my neighbor,

273
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:41,083
我好像再也没有收到过你的消息
slept with me, and then, stole my prized butterfly.

274
00:15:41,118 --> 00:15:42,985
那只猫真是你的吗?
Was that even really your cat?

275
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,920
那只小猫绝对是我的
Oh, that little kitty is very much mine.

276
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:49,792
听着 我... 我真的想打电话跟你道歉
Listen, I... I... I really did mean to call and apologize.

277
00:15:49,793 --> 00:15:52,785
你拿我的喜马拉雅皇冠蝶做了什么?
So what did you do with the Himalayan Stamped Crown you took from me?

278
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,710
你在易贝上把它卖了吗?  
You sell it on eBay?  

279
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:55,598
不 我没有卖
No, I didn't sell it.

280
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:58,001
我真的需要它
I really needed it.

281
00:15:58,035 --> 00:15:59,736
而且我还不能解释原因
And... and I can't explain why.

282
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,504
好吧 听着
All right, look,

283
00:16:01,538 --> 00:16:03,705
我很感激你营造的整个神秘的氛围
I appreciate the whole mysterious vibe thing.

284
00:16:03,739 --> 00:16:05,774
我也肯定有人喜欢这种感觉
I'm sure it works on some guys.

285
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:08,777
只是我现在不想浪费时间去琢磨清楚
I just don't have the time to figure you out right now.

286
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:11,671
好吗? 我很忙
Okay? I'm busy.

287
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:14,170
等等 等等 等等 对不起
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Sorry. Okay.

288
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:15,784
对不起
I'm sorry.

289
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:19,021
你说的很对 我的确... 的确对你撒谎了
What you said was right. I did... I did lie to you.

290
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:22,357
的确... 利用了你 我心里很愧疚
I did... use you, and I feel terrible about it.

291
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,317
你也许不想琢磨我 但是我想琢磨你
You may not want to figure me out, but I want to figure you out.

292
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,317
我们第一次见面的时候 有一种感觉
When we first met, there was this connection.

293
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:33,099
我们之间有火花
A spark between us.

294
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,438
而且我想继续发展下去
And I want to get to the bottom of it.

295
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:38,974
真的吗?
You do?

296
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,712
我姐姐今天对我说了一些很有意义的话
My sister said something to me today that made a lot of sense.

297
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:44,818
抓住机会享受生活
You got to grab life while you can.

298
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:47,621
谁知道我们还有几条命... 我的意思是
Who knows how many lives... I mean, years...

299
00:16:47,852 --> 00:16:50,220
还能活几年?
We all have left?

300
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:53,726
听着 我不是外面那种玩玩而已的人
Look, I'm not in the market for someone who plays games.

301
00:16:53,727 --> 00:16:56,361
我知道 我知道 我真的知道
I get it. I get it, I do.

302
00:16:56,826 --> 00:16:59,762
再给我一次机会吧?
Just give me another chance?

303
00:16:59,796 --> 00:17:01,564
一起去吃午餐吧
Let's go to lunch.

304
00:17:01,598 --> 00:17:05,101
我发誓 我不是玩玩而已
There will be no games, I swear.

305
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:08,597
除非你想玩点什么
I mean, unless you want to play them.

306
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:30,395
你真是... 太慷慨了 亲爱的
Oh. Oh, you're... Mmm... So generous, darling.

307
00:17:30,396 --> 00:17:33,231
多谢你能来 爱你
Oh, thank you so much for coming. Love you.

308
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:36,034
我很快就回来 你好
I'll be right back. Oh, hello.

309
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,826
英格丽德? 你在这儿呀 
Ingrid? Here you are. 

310
00:17:51,827 --> 00:17:52,866
你好 乔治
Hey, George.

311
00:17:55,225 --> 00:17:56,303
你好吗?  
How are you?  

312
00:17:56,304 --> 00:17:58,639
很好 你今天能来真是太好了
Good. It was nice of you to come today.

313
00:17:58,673 --> 00:18:00,207
当然了
Oh, of course.

314
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:02,910
我在以我的方式支持图书馆的工作
I try to support the library in any way I can.

315
00:18:02,945 --> 00:18:06,786
当然了 也在... 支持你
And, uh... Support you, obviously.

316
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:08,649
多谢
I appreciate that.

317
00:18:09,895 --> 00:18:11,575
- 你好啊 - 你好
- Hey, you. - Hey.

318
00:18:11,576 --> 00:18:13,777
- 开心吗? - 你开玩笑吧?
- You having a good time? - Are you kidding me?

319
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:15,688
这是我在图书馆过得最开心的一次
This is the most fun I've ever had in a library.

320
00:18:15,689 --> 00:18:16,946
是吗?
Is it?

321
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:19,216
我有一个让我们更开心的想法
Well, I know a way we can have even more fun.

322
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,784
真的吗?
Oh, really?

323
00:18:20,818 --> 00:18:22,453
我们去伦敦吧
Let's go to London.

324
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:24,882
什么? 就这样吗?
What? Just like that?

325
00:18:24,883 --> 00:18:27,459
你就这样掰掰手指头 我们就要去伦敦了吗?
You're just gonna snap your fingers, and we're gonna go to London?

326
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,475
是的 明天怎么样? 
Yup. How about tomorrow?  

327
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:30,886
你是认真的吗?
Are you serious?

328
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:35,251
我被邀请两天后在英国的医学会议上做演讲
I got invited to speak at a medical conference in England in two days.

329
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:37,598
听着 我知道这有点急 你会去吗?
Look, I know it's last minute but, are you in?

330
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:40,173
当然去了
Yes, of course I am.

331
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:42,177
有时候你可能得一个人待着...
You might be on your own for some of it, be...

332
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:43,545
我是说 我估计...
I mean, I assume you just...

333
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:44,871
你不愿意一整天听我讲
You know, you don't want to watch me speak 

334
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:46,087
第三世界接种疫苗什么的
about third world vaccinations all day.

335
00:18:46,088 --> 00:18:49,148
无意冒犯 我想我能找到事做
No offense, I think I can fill my time.

336
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:52,072
不敢相信我就要在我的护照上盖一个章了
I can't believe I'm gonna finally have a stamp on my passport.

337
00:18:52,138 --> 00:18:54,340
盖两个吧 对 我们盖两个吧
Let's make it two. Yeah, let's make it two.

338
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:56,902
我们去英法海峡隧道看看 顺便在巴黎待几天
Let's hop on the Chunnel, we'll tack on a couple of days in Paris.

339
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,113
去吃一下牛角面包 喝点红酒
We'll eat croissants, drink wine.

340
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,131
这就是我们蜜月的预演
It'll be a rehearsal for our honeymoon.

341
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:04,537
你太让我高兴了! 太棒了！太棒了！
You are killing me! Yes! Yes! 

342
00:19:04,538 --> 00:19:05,739
真是不可思议
That sounds incredible.

343
00:19:10,744 --> 00:19:13,880
你知道我们要像第一次约会那样
You do you realize we were supposed to be having lunch,

344
00:19:13,914 --> 00:19:15,715
去吃午餐的吧?
like a real first date, right?

345
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:17,716
我刚刚有了胃口
I'm just building up an appetite.

346
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,985
我想是的
I think we did that.

347
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,821
你想去哪儿呢?
Where do you want to go?

348
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:23,756
你说吧
You choose.

349
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,458
我怎样都行
I'm good with anything.

350
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:27,860
你当然是啦
Yes, you are.

351
00:19:32,543 --> 00:19:34,611
这项链你是在哪儿弄的?
Where did you get this necklace?

352
00:19:34,646 --> 00:19:36,113
看起来很古老 很酷
Looks antique. It's cool.

353
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:37,882
我不知道
Oh. I don't know.

354
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,810
已经很久了 都不记得了
I've had it for so long, I can't even remember.

355
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:41,986
穿好衣服我们出发吧
Go get dressed so we can go.

356
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,221
好的
Okay.

357
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:51,129
总之 我一会再过来
Anyway, I should probably be getting back.

358
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:53,698
改天我们能一起去喝一杯吗?
Hey, why don't we go and get a drink some time?

359
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:57,135
好贴心 但是我现在还不想这样
That is sweet, but I'm not really in place for that right now.

360
00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:00,197
怎么了? 娱乐一下你也害怕吗?
What's the problem? Are you afraid of a little fun?

361
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:03,641
- 不 我不想要这样的娱乐 - 是吗?
- No. This isn't my idea of fun. - Oh, yeah?

362
00:20:03,676 --> 00:20:06,719
为何不... 告诉我你的想法呢?
Why don't you... Tell me some of your ideas?

363
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,421
好吧 我们就聊到这里吧  
Okay. This conversation is over.  

364
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:10,669
我可不这么想
I don't think that it is.

365
00:20:10,682 --> 00:20:12,150
骨折
Fractura.

366
00:20:13,285 --> 00:20:15,713
你弄断了我的手指 怎么...?
You broke my fingers. What...?

367
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,024
也许你现在该离开了
You should probably move along now.

368
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:32,136
你不必这么做的 我可以自己照顾自己
You didn't have to do that. I can take care of myself.

369
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:37,709
你和弗雷娅之间有什么吗?
Is there something happening between you and Freya?

370
00:20:37,743 --> 00:20:39,506
你在说些什么啊?  
What are you talking about?  

371
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:41,446
我不知道 我以为...
I don't know, I thought...

372
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:43,800
感觉我刚才好像打扰到你们了
Just felt like I was interrupting something earlier.

373
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:45,684
剪头发而已
A haircut.

374
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:47,886
我知道这不关我的事
Look, I know it's none of my business,

375
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:50,755
但是 我想你们之前也许...
but, um, I just wondered if you two had maybe ever...

376
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,557
没有 艾米...
No. God, no. Amy...

377
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:55,059
我只是想确定我没有成为第三者...
I just want to make sure I'm not getting in the middle of something...

378
00:20:55,094 --> 00:20:57,896
显然 我不是 我想去喝一杯 好吗?
Which, apparently, I'm not. I'm gonna go get a drink, okay?

379
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,766
- 你想要什么吗? - 不用了 谢谢
- Do you want anything? - No thanks. I'm good.

380
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:07,807
打扰一下 我们需要谈谈
Excuse me, we need to talk.

381
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:13,979
从小时候开始我就能预感到不好的事情
Ever since I was a little kid, I know when something bad

382
00:21:14,014 --> 00:21:16,716
我有这种天赋
is gonna happen. I get this feeling in my stomach.

383
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,085
我现在就有这种感觉 莫名的
And I have the feeling, right now, out of nowhere.

384
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,154
你太多疑了 没什么不好的事情会发生
You're being paranoid. Nothing bad is going to happen.

385
00:21:21,188 --> 00:21:23,457
我告诉你 我的骨头都能感觉到
I am telling you, I can feel it in my bones.

386
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,028
我以为是你的胃感觉到了呢  
I thought you felt it in your stomach?  

387
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:26,127
我两个地方都感觉到了
I feel it in both places.

388
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,562
- 如果是跟我们有关... - 哇哦!
- Look, if this is about us, um... - Whoa!

389
00:21:28,597 --> 00:21:31,098
停 没有我们 从来没有
Whoa, there is no us, and there never has been.

390
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:35,513
- 这不完全正确吧 - 没什么要发生
- That's not exactly true. - Nothing is happening.

391
00:21:35,514 --> 00:21:38,042
有发生过 但是是很久以前了 
Something happened, but it was a long time ago. 

392
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:39,306
而且只是一个吻
It was just a kiss.

393
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,308
我们都知道这是一个巨大的错误
And we both know that it was a huge mistake.

394
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,986
所以 我们不会告诉任何人 
And that is why, we are never, ever, going to tell anyone, 

395
00:21:43,987 --> 00:21:45,613
因为这已经结束了
because it's over.

396
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:47,915
好吧 放轻松 深呼吸
Okay, relax, take a deep breath.

397
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,319
我保证 都会好的
It'll all be fine, I promise.

398
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,961
好的
Okay.

399
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:18,212
来了!
I got it!

400
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,451
- 英格丽德！ - 温迪姨妈 你得跟我来
- Ingrid! - Aunt Wendy, you have to come with me.

401
00:22:24,485 --> 00:22:27,557
天呐 我怎么把图书馆的事情给忘了呢?
Oh, no. I forgot the library event, didn't I?

402
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:29,110
弗雷娅一定会很生气  
Freya's going to be so pissed.  

403
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:30,908
不 是妈妈... 她受伤了
No, no. It's mom... she's hurt.

404
00:22:30,925 --> 00:22:33,027
很紧急 你得跟我来
It's an emergency. You have to come with me now.

405
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,641
什么? 等一下 让我...  
What? Wait, let me just...  

406
00:22:34,642 --> 00:22:35,168
就是现在!
No! Now!

407
00:22:35,183 --> 00:22:37,002
利奥 我姐姐出事了！
Leo, there's an emergency with my sister!

408
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:38,846
温迪?
Wendy?

409
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,477
发生了什么?
What happened?

410
00:22:43,478 --> 00:22:45,885
这个变形人想用黑魔法杀死她
This shape-shifter tried to kill her with some dark magic.

411
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:47,560
- 她伤得多严重? - 很严重
- How bad is she hurt? - Pretty bad.

412
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:48,556
唯一能帮她的是
The only way to help her is 

413
00:22:48,557 --> 00:22:50,690
你从阿奇博尔德那里拿来的蛇钥匙
with the snake key you took from Archibald.

414
00:22:50,724 --> 00:22:53,193
蛇钥匙? 我从来没提起过啊
Snake key? I never said anything about a snake key.

415
00:22:53,227 --> 00:22:55,295
- 你说起过 - 不 要是说过我会记得的
- Yes, you did. - No. I would remember that.

416
00:22:55,329 --> 00:22:57,030
我想母亲可能提起过
I think mother may have mentioned it.

417
00:22:57,065 --> 00:22:58,566
- 是金色的... - 母亲?
- It was gold... - Mother?

418
00:22:59,915 --> 00:23:02,192
等一下 你怎么知道我在这里? 
Wait a minute. How did you know I was here? 

419
00:23:02,193 --> 00:23:03,104
你们没人认识利奥啊
Nobody knows about Leo.

420
00:23:04,906 --> 00:23:06,140
你是谁?
Who are you?

421
00:23:06,174 --> 00:23:08,309
我是你的侄女
I'm your niece.

422
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:13,829
你从扶手上推下去 害死的那个人
The one you threw over a railing and killed.

423
00:23:14,283 --> 00:23:16,283
现在你知道什么感觉了
And now you know how it feels.

424
00:23:32,547 --> 00:23:34,882
醒来
Expergiscendum.

425
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:43,189
你动不了
You cannot move.

426
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:46,782
这圈不允许你动
The circle will not let you.

427
00:23:46,783 --> 00:23:50,085
你总是说 我是我们中最强大的
You always said I was the most powerful one of us all.

428
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,832
你是变形人吗?
Are you the shifter?

429
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:57,369
变形人让我苏醒了
The shifter reanimated me.

430
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,432
我是英格丽德 你的侄女 
I'm Ingrid, your niece. 

431
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:01,324
你杀死的那个 记得吗?
The one you killed, remember?

432
00:24:01,329 --> 00:24:04,084
你想从我这里得到什么? 
What the hell do you want from me?  

433
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:05,232
我要巨蛇座
I want the serpens clavem.

434
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:07,601
我不知道怎么跟你说
Look, I don't know what to tell you.

435
00:24:07,636 --> 00:24:10,337
它早在几百年前就被销毁了
It was destroyed hundreds of years ago.

436
00:24:24,153 --> 00:24:26,788
灼烧!
Ustulo!

437
00:24:29,946 --> 00:24:33,788
这复仇我等了一百多年了
I've been waiting over 100 years for this revenge.

438
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:35,864
加强灼烧!
Ustulo rivulus!

439
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,694
是你啊
It's you.

440
00:24:52,885 --> 00:24:55,486
迈克 我是迈克
Mike. It's Mike.

441
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,055
我能坐这张长椅吗?
Am I allowed to sit on this bench?

442
00:24:58,089 --> 00:25:00,357
我要道歉
I completely need to apologize

443
00:25:00,391 --> 00:25:04,843
我昨天在图书馆朝你大吼
for yelling at you, um, at the library yesterday.

444
00:25:04,844 --> 00:25:07,596
没关系 我知道我可能有点...
Not a problem. I know I can be a little...

445
00:25:07,611 --> 00:25:10,757
我想说谢谢帮我处理那个家伙
I wanted to say thank you for helping me with that guy.

446
00:25:10,773 --> 00:25:13,714
只是想让你知道 我能自己处理
Just as long as you know, I could've handled that myself.

447
00:25:13,749 --> 00:25:16,584
我知道 你看起来很能干
I have no doubt. You seem very capable.

448
00:25:16,618 --> 00:25:18,836
我发现他跟踪你去了过道
But when I saw him follow you down the aisle,

449
00:25:18,837 --> 00:25:21,635
就决定看着你 以防万一
I decided to check on you just in case.

450
00:25:22,838 --> 00:25:24,425
谢谢
Thanks.

451
00:25:25,015 --> 00:25:28,330
你知道我的名字 我能知道你的吗?
So, you know my name. Do I get to know yours?

452
00:25:28,364 --> 00:25:31,767
不好意思 我是英格丽德 英格丽德・波尚
I'm so sorry. I'm-I'm Ingrid. Ingrid Beauchamp.

453
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:34,670
- 很好听的名字 - 谢谢
- Oh, that's a really pretty name. - Thank you.

454
00:25:34,678 --> 00:25:37,083
很高兴认识你 英格丽德・波尚
Nice to meet you, Ingrid Beauchamp.

455
00:25:38,107 --> 00:25:41,443
我应该...
I should... Oh.

456
00:25:41,478 --> 00:25:42,791
妈妈
Hi, mom.

457
00:25:43,046 --> 00:25:45,425
我一会就到
Yeah. I'll be right there.

458
00:25:45,426 --> 00:25:48,983
我得走了 我们会在图书馆见面的对吧?
I have to run, but, um, I'll see you at the library, right?

459
00:25:49,018 --> 00:25:52,401
- 我还能进去吗? - 当然 随时啊
- I'm... I'm still allowed? - Yes. Anytime you want.

460
00:25:52,402 --> 00:25:53,835
好的
All right.

461
00:26:09,172 --> 00:26:12,107
你见到达什了吗? 他刚刚在图书馆消失了
Hey, have you seen Dash? He just disappeared from the library.

462
00:26:12,142 --> 00:26:15,755
没有 也许他去医院了呢
Not lately. He probably got paged to the hospital or something.

463
00:26:15,756 --> 00:26:17,657
你知道他多爱拯救生命的
You know how much he loves saving lives.

464
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:19,158
我不这么觉得
Yeah, I don't think so.

465
00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:21,326
你来了 - 怎么了 大哥? 
Oh, there you are. - What's up, brother?  

466
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:22,394
我一直给你打电话
I've been calling you...

467
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:24,730
怎么了?
What? What?

468
00:26:24,764 --> 00:26:25,554
达什 等一下!  
Dash, wait!  

469
00:26:25,555 --> 00:26:26,432
现在不是时候 弗雷娅
No, not now, Freya.

470
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:28,267
天呐...
Oh, my...

471
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:52,313
- 你好 有何贵干? - 我找温迪
- Hey. Can I help you? - I'm looking for Wendy.

472
00:26:52,314 --> 00:26:55,295
她之前在我家 但是她忘了拿她的包
She was at my place earlier, but she left her bag, and said

473
00:26:55,296 --> 00:26:57,595
好像她姐姐有麻烦了?
something about her sister being in trouble?

474
00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:02,623
- 不好意思 你是谁? - 我是利奥
- I'm sorry. Who are you? - Oh... right. I'm Leo.

475
00:27:02,624 --> 00:27:06,486
我是乔安娜 温迪的姐姐 我很好啊
I'm Joanna. I'm Wendy's sister, and, uh, I'm fine.

476
00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:08,576
告诉我到底发生了什么?
Um, tell... Exactly what happened?

477
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:13,080
我当时在换衣服 有人敲门
Well, I... I was changing clothes, and someone knocked on the door.

478
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:16,217
温迪去开门了 等我出来想看看什么事
Wendy went to go answer it, and by the time I came out to see

479
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:18,553
她就已经走了
what was going on, she was gone.

480
00:27:18,646 --> 00:27:22,170
你也没见到她 对吗? 你觉得她还好吗?
You haven't seen her, either, have you? You think she's okay?

481
00:27:22,204 --> 00:27:24,672
我相信这一定是个误会
I'm sure it's just some big misunderstanding.

482
00:27:24,707 --> 00:27:28,809
我会告诉她你来过 谢谢你告诉我
Um, I'll let her know you were here. Thanks for telling me.

483
00:27:30,746 --> 00:27:33,180
该死的
Damn it.

484
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,355
快点 找到光吧
Come on, find the light.

485
00:27:44,835 --> 00:27:47,298
出现项链吧
Show me the necklace.

486
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:05,363
- 达什 你在做什么啊? - 我要去伦敦
- Dash, what are you doing? - I'm leaving early for London.

487
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:06,803
我觉得我一个人离开比较好
I think it's better if I go alone.

488
00:28:06,837 --> 00:28:09,072
我不知道你怎么想的...
Look, I... I don't know what you think you know about...

489
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:11,654
我听到你的话了 弗雷娅 在图书馆
I heard you, Freya, at the library.

490
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:13,556
听到你对他说的话了
Heard everything you said to him.

491
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,325
你听到我说这是一个天大的错误了吗?
Did you hear me say that it was a huge mistake?

492
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,928
这只是过去的事 不能意味什么的?
That it was in the past, and didn't mean anything?

493
00:28:18,962 --> 00:28:20,523
拜托 你不能...  
Come on, you weren't...  

494
00:28:20,524 --> 00:28:21,517
我不能怎么样?!
I wasn't what?!

495
00:28:21,518 --> 00:28:23,713
我不该发现这些吗?
Huh? I wasn't supposed to find out?

496
00:28:23,714 --> 00:28:25,111
我早就该猜到
Yeah, I could've guessed that.

497
00:28:25,112 --> 00:28:26,673
达什 听着 我爱你 
Wait, Dash, look, I love you. Please, just... 

498
00:28:26,674 --> 00:28:28,547
别这样 这只是个错...
This was a big mis...

499
00:28:28,548 --> 00:28:30,648
我现在都不想看见你
I can't even look at you right now.

500
00:28:35,688 --> 00:28:38,423
只要你告诉我蛇钥匙在哪里 这一切就会结束
This will end if you tell me where the snake is.

501
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:39,791
它已经没有了
It's gone.

502
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:45,630
即使我知道在哪里 我也不会告诉你
But if I knew where it was, I wouldn't tell you anyway.

503
00:28:45,664 --> 00:28:48,666
你过去很堕落 现在也一样
You were corrupt then, and you're corrupt now.

504
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,310
好吧
Fine.

505
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,281
那我只能杀了你了
Then I guess I get to kill you.

506
00:28:53,973 --> 00:28:56,442
动手吧
Go ahead.

507
00:28:56,476 --> 00:29:00,479
我就坐在这里... 等着
And then I'll sit here... And wait.

508
00:29:00,896 --> 00:29:05,817
等你复活后 我再杀了你 不管多少次
And when you come back to life, I'll kill you again, as many times as it takes.

509
00:29:06,152 --> 00:29:09,654
英格丽德 等等 我们...
Ingrid, wait. We... we...

510
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:13,558
我不小心杀了你
I killed you by mistake.

511
00:29:13,593 --> 00:29:16,628
我还是你姨妈
I'm still your aunt.

512
00:29:16,662 --> 00:29:20,331
你还是我的侄女 这不是真正的你
You're still my niece. This isn't who you are.

513
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:26,735
实际上 我觉得这才是真正的我
Actually, I think this is exactly who I am.

514
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:28,236
不
No.

515
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:30,004
夺命掏心
Acidum adere!

516
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:41,658
英格丽德?
Ingrid?

517
00:29:50,264 --> 00:29:53,300
- 不 妈妈 不要 - 你不是我女儿
- No, mom, please don't. - You're not my daughter.

518
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,674
看着我的眼睛 你知道我是谁
Look in my eyes; You know who I am.

519
00:29:55,684 --> 00:29:57,418
我是英格丽德啊
I'm Ingrid.

520
00:29:58,806 --> 00:30:02,210
我们等会再聊这个
Okay, we'll talk about this later.

521
00:30:04,613 --> 00:30:07,482
我们先带你姨妈离开这里
Let's get your aunt and get her out of here.

522
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:10,019
恢复!
Reverte!

523
00:30:15,524 --> 00:30:19,861
化为灰烬
Reverte ad vestrum priorem statum.

524
00:30:19,895 --> 00:30:22,097
可你不杀人的啊
But you don't kill people.

525
00:30:22,131 --> 00:30:24,267
你已经死了
You were already dead.

526
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,211
- 这么说不是假冒者干的? - 不是
- So it wasn't the shifter? - No.

527
00:30:52,105 --> 00:30:54,507
是另一个很久以前的敌人
It was another enemy from a long time ago,

528
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:56,676
我猜 是假冒者派来的
I assume, sent by the shifter.

529
00:30:56,711 --> 00:31:00,591
- 谁 什么敌人? - 你不知道
- Who, what enemy? - No one you'd know about.

530
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:04,685
我已经疗好了她的烧伤 她会好起来的
I've healed her burns, so she's going to be okay.

531
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,454
现在我们只能等
All we can do now is wait.

532
00:31:08,662 --> 00:31:10,787
达什要一个人去伦敦
Dash is going to London without me,

533
00:31:10,788 --> 00:31:13,107
我甚至不知道他还想不想娶我
and I don't even know if he still wants to marry me.

534
00:31:14,095 --> 00:31:18,706
- 亲爱的 怎么了? - 他发现了
- Sweetie, what happened? - He found out.

535
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:21,702
我就知道会这样的
I knew it was gonna happen.

536
00:31:21,736 --> 00:31:23,904
我只是... 自从我发现自己的身份以来
I just... ever since I found out what I am,

537
00:31:23,939 --> 00:31:26,151
我的直觉变得越来越强烈
my intuition just keeps getting

538
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:30,477
而且我 我需要更加信任自己
stronger and stronger, and I, I need to trust myself more.

539
00:31:30,512 --> 00:31:33,581
- 很抱歉 弗雷娅 - 达什发现什么了?
- I'm so sorry, Freya. - Dash found out about what?

540
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:36,183
我和基利安的事 我们接吻了
About Killian and me. We kissed.

541
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:39,834
- 就在她的订婚宴会上 - 那是个错误!
- At her engagement party. - It was a mistake!

542
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:41,899
那是我这辈子最大的错误
The biggest mistake of my entire life.

543
00:31:41,907 --> 00:31:46,460
- 因为我就是个坏人 - 你不是坏人
- Because I'm a terrible person. - You're not a terrible person.

544
00:31:46,494 --> 00:31:49,363
人都免不了犯错
People make mistakes.

545
00:31:49,397 --> 00:31:51,332
可不能犯这种错误 妈妈
Not like this, mom.

546
00:31:51,366 --> 00:31:54,201
相信我吧 我犯的错误更多 更严重
Oh, believe me, I've done much, much worse.

547
00:31:54,236 --> 00:31:57,872
我觉得达什离开是件好事
I think it's good that Dash went away.

548
00:31:57,907 --> 00:32:01,443
这样他就有机会一个人想想他怎么会这么爱你
It'll give him some alone time to remember why he loves you so much.

549
00:32:01,477 --> 00:32:04,780
- 你真的这么认为? - 当然
- You really think that? - Definitely.

550
00:32:04,814 --> 00:32:07,850
我们为什么要看温迪姨妈睡觉呢?
Why are we watching aunt Wendy sleep?

551
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,901
她不是在睡觉 她死了 
She's not asleep, she's dead. 

552
00:32:09,902 --> 00:32:11,186
天哪 又死了?
Oh, my God, again?

553
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,275
没事的
It's okay.

554
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:15,125
她不会死很久的
She won't be long now.

555
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:18,461
天哪
Oh, God.

556
00:32:18,495 --> 00:32:20,071
这一直不见好
Oh, that never gets any better.

557
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:23,066
欢迎回来... 很高兴看见你又活过来了
Welcome back... it's nice to see you breathing again.

558
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,236
好的 大家都在呢 我错过了什么?
Okay, so we're all here. What did I miss?

559
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:31,667
你被杀了 然后 一个叫利奥的朋友来看你了
You got killed, um, and, a friend named Leo stopped by, looking for you.

560
00:32:32,668 --> 00:32:36,213
貌似很关心的样子 貌似有点喜欢你
Seemed concerned, seemed to like you.

561
00:32:37,282 --> 00:32:40,554
我猜你听了我的话 对吧?
I guess you took my advice, huh?

562
00:32:40,555 --> 00:32:42,253
嗯 有点吧
Yeah, a little bit.

563
00:32:42,288 --> 00:32:44,989
- 好啦 来吧 姑娘们 - 好
- All right, come on, girls. - Yeah.

564
00:32:45,024 --> 00:32:47,691
我们来让温迪恢复能量
Let's let Wendy get her strength back.

565
00:32:47,726 --> 00:32:48,759
- 英格丽德 - 在呢
- Ingrid. - Yeah.

566
00:32:48,793 --> 00:32:51,228
- 我能跟你说句话吗? - 当然
- Can I talk to you for a second? - Of course.

567
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:55,066
那我们没事啦? 我是说 我们扯平了?
So we're okay? I mean, we're even now?

568
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,300
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

569
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:58,936
你妈妈没告诉你吗?
Oh, your mom didn't tell you?

570
00:32:58,971 --> 00:33:02,819
你杀了我 当然 我是说 1906年的你
You killed me. Oh, I mean, you know, the you from 1906.

571
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,083
什么?
What?

572
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:06,677
假冒者教唆你... 以前的你...
The shifter reanimated you... the old you...

573
00:33:06,712 --> 00:33:08,713
然后让你来找我报仇
And sent you after me for revenge.

574
00:33:08,748 --> 00:33:11,049
天哪 我...
Oh, my God, I'm...

575
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:13,551
那 以前的我现在在哪里?
So, where is old me now?

576
00:33:14,186 --> 00:33:15,756
嗯 我也不知道
Uh, um, I'm not sure.

577
00:33:15,757 --> 00:33:18,790
你得问问你妈妈 不过我确定她已经搞定了
You have to ask your mom about that, but I'm sure she took care of it.

578
00:33:18,824 --> 00:33:22,360
- 对不起 - 没事的 不是你的错
- I'm so sorry. - No, it's okay, it wasn't you.

579
00:33:22,394 --> 00:33:26,480
不 就是我 她干什么 我也有责任
Yes, it was me. I mean, whatever she did, I'm capable of.

580
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:27,836
我们是一样的  
We're the same person.  

581
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:29,700
不 亲爱的 不是这样的
No, honey, it doesn't work like that.

582
00:33:29,735 --> 00:33:31,602
所有的生命都完全不同
Every life is completely different.

583
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:33,453
只是生命终结的时间不同罢了  
Except every life ends about now.  

584
00:33:33,454 --> 00:33:35,331
这可未必
Not necessarily.

585
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:37,119
要是历史能暗示什么就好了
If history is any indication.  

586
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,233
历史也可能改变的 我看见了
History can change; I've seen it.

587
00:33:40,402 --> 00:33:43,171
感觉很怪
It just feels like impossible odds.

588
00:33:43,205 --> 00:33:46,841
我是说 自从我发现自己是女巫以来...
I mean, ever since I discovered what I am...

589
00:33:46,876 --> 00:33:49,711
我就不断收到一些坏消息
It's been an endless parade of bad news.

590
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,116
感觉好像我不知道自己是谁了一样
I feel like I don't know who I am anymore.

591
00:33:54,828 --> 00:33:58,148
要是有什么不同的话 我更了解你了
Well, if it makes any difference, I know who you are.

592
00:33:58,666 --> 00:34:01,567
你有一颗善良的心
You have such a good heart.

593
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:04,486
你是迄今为止我最喜欢的英格丽德
You're my favorite Ingrid yet.

594
00:34:06,094 --> 00:34:08,262
谢谢
Thank you.

595
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:13,015
- 我爱你 宝贝儿 - 我也爱你
- I love you, sweetie. - I love you, too.

596
00:34:17,606 --> 00:34:20,740
- 还以为你回家了呢 - 我来帮忙清查
- Thought you went home. - Here to help with inventory.

597
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:24,444
- 天哪 这里好热 - 罗杰不想修火炉
- Man, is it hot in here. - Roger refuses to fix the furnace.

598
00:34:24,478 --> 00:34:26,196
我不停地拿这件事烦他 
I keep bugging him about it. 

599
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,447
想让我去烦他吗?
Want me to bug him?

600
00:34:27,481 --> 00:34:29,683
有人说我特别擅长烦别人
I've been told I'm very good at bugging people.

601
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:34,087
你得走了
You have to go.

602
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:36,056
什么?
What?

603
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:40,995
这是个梦... 是我最后一次梦见你
This is a dream... the last dream I'll have about you.

604
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:44,331
- 再见了 - 等等 不 你不能
- I'm saying good-bye. - Wait, no, you can't.

605
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:45,899
弗雷娅 听我说
Freya, listen to me.

606
00:34:45,934 --> 00:34:47,426
这一切都不是你想的那样  
None of this is what you think.  

607
00:34:47,427 --> 00:34:48,116
再见 基利安
Bye, Killian.

608
00:35:13,729 --> 00:35:16,130
嘿 你醒了
Hey, you're up.

609
00:35:16,165 --> 00:35:18,430
- 嘿 - 我做了件正确的事
- Hey. - Well, I did something right.

610
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:20,528
我念的那个咒语起作用了 
The spell I did worked. 

611
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:22,800
我想我再也不会梦见基利安了
I think I'm finally done dreaming of Killian.

612
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:26,331
- 你在干什么? - 弗雷娅 坐下
- What are you doing? - Freya, sit down.

613
00:35:29,743 --> 00:35:33,113
我曾经规定再也不给你们两个占卜了
I made a rule that I would never deal the deck for you girls.

614
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:34,781
我觉得这是自找麻烦
I think it's asking for problems,

615
00:35:34,815 --> 00:35:37,184
不过我知道你很困惑
but I know you're confused

616
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:41,488
很好奇 所以我给你做了
and curious, so I did it for you.

617
00:35:41,523 --> 00:35:44,706
- 它说什么? - 很复杂
- Well, what does it say? - It's complicated.

618
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,061
比我想象中还要复杂
It's more complicated than I realized.

619
00:35:48,095 --> 00:35:50,911
它有说我和达什将来会怎样吗?
Does it say something about my future with Dash?

620
00:35:50,919 --> 00:35:52,887
我们还会结婚吗?
Are we still getting married?

621
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:54,622
我不知道会发生什么事
I don't know what will happen.

622
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:58,334
未来被包在里面
There's a shroud around the future

623
00:35:58,483 --> 00:36:02,296
因为你还没有做决定
because your choice isn't yet made.

624
00:36:02,331 --> 00:36:03,631
什么?
What?

625
00:36:03,665 --> 00:36:06,134
这就是你
This is you

626
00:36:06,168 --> 00:36:10,905
你是一切的中心 被爱和家人包围
in the center of everything, surrounded by love and family.

627
00:36:10,906 --> 00:36:12,291
这才是问题
This is the problem.

628
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:15,843
什么 是骗子和皇帝吗?
What, the trickster and the emperor?

629
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:17,511
他们是镜子的两面 
They're mirror images, they're often

630
00:36:17,546 --> 00:36:20,914
经常以兄弟存在... 一个黑暗 一个光明
depicted as brothers... One dark, one light.

631
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:23,183
这么说一个是达什一个是基利安?
So one is Dash and one is Killian?

632
00:36:23,218 --> 00:36:28,155
还有 根据牌面 他们分开了你的心
Mm-hmm, and, according to the cards, they divide your heart.

633
00:36:28,189 --> 00:36:31,425
那 基利安肯定是黑暗面 对吧?
Well, Killian is obviously the dark one, right?

634
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:34,494
骗子可能是任何一个
The trickster could be either.

635
00:36:34,529 --> 00:36:37,764
他可能是化妆成光明的黑暗
He could be dark masquerading as light.

636
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:40,434
这就是他干的事... 他让你困惑
That's what he does... He confuses you.

637
00:36:40,468 --> 00:36:43,170
这是什么意思?
What does that even mean?

638
00:36:43,204 --> 00:36:48,056
根据牌面 你会爱上他们两个
According to the cards, you will love them both.

639
00:36:48,564 --> 00:36:50,887
你必须要做个决定
You have a choice to make.

640
00:36:50,888 --> 00:36:55,883
一个是你的灵魂伴侣 一个是你的冤家
One man is your soul mate, the other man's your destroyer.

641
00:36:56,385 --> 00:37:00,155
你的选择将会决定你的命运
Whoever you choose will decide your fate.

642
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:09,629
- 终于好了 - 什么?
- Oh, finally. - What?

643
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:12,960
我一活过来就等着跟你说话
I've been wanting to talk to you since I came back to life,

644
00:37:12,961 --> 00:37:16,035
可我不想当着姑娘们的面说
but I didn't want to say anything in front of the girls.

645
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,203
为什么?
Why?

646
00:37:17,238 --> 00:37:21,041
知道吗? 我可以喝一杯
You know what? I could use a drink.

647
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:26,838
所以呢...
So...

648
00:37:27,966 --> 00:37:31,318
所以 自从你第一次遇到危险
So, you know, ever since I had the first vision of you being in danger,

649
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:35,316
我们就在努力寻找假冒者和他的目的 对吗?
we've been trying to figure out who the shifter is and what they want, right?

650
00:37:35,317 --> 00:37:39,593
你是说除了毁掉我们以外?
You mean aside from destroying us?

651
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:43,243
我还不知道假冒者是谁
Well, I still don't know who the shifter is,

652
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:45,358
不过我想我知道他们的目的了 
but I think I know what they want, 

653
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,567
这可不是好消息
and it's not good news.

654
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:49,580
那 他们什么目的?
So, what is it?

655
00:37:50,713 --> 00:37:54,397
死去的英格丽德不停地要巨蛇座...
Dead Ingrid kept asking for the serpens clavem...

656
00:37:54,431 --> 00:37:56,199
那条金蛇
The golden snake.

657
00:37:56,632 --> 00:37:58,843
- 真的吗...? - 对
- Really...? - Yeah.

658
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,672
那她为什么要问你呢?
Well, why is she asking you?

659
00:38:02,706 --> 00:38:05,241
我不知道 她以为是我从阿奇博尔德那儿偷的
I don't know, she thought I stole it from Archibald,

660
00:38:05,275 --> 00:38:08,711
我一直告诉她那东西被毁掉了 可她不相信我
and I kept telling her that it was destroyed, and she didn't believe me.

661
00:38:08,746 --> 00:38:10,513
是被毁掉了 对吧?
It was destroyed, right?

662
00:38:10,548 --> 00:38:12,182
是啊 当然
Yes, of course.

663
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:14,477
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

664
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:17,836
我只是随便说说 要是你错了呢?
I'm just saying, what if you're wrong?

665
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,390
要是它还在外面
What if it's still out there

666
00:38:19,391 --> 00:38:22,025
假冒者得到它并且打开入口呢?
and the shifter gets a hold of it and opens the portal?

667
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:24,327
钥匙已经不存在了
The key no longer exists.

668
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:25,828
我亲眼看见它被毁了
I saw it get destroyed.

669
00:38:25,863 --> 00:38:30,533
没有人能打开那个入口了
No one's opening that portal ever again.

670
00:38:30,568 --> 00:38:32,430
好吧 不过它的分支...
Okay, but the ramus mortium...

671
00:38:32,454 --> 00:38:35,139
正在入口附近的地下墓穴里生长
It was growing in the catacombs near the entrance.

672
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,595
这不仅仅是巧合 对吗?
I think that's more than a coincidence, right?

673
00:38:38,976 --> 00:38:43,380
没有钥匙没有人能打开那扇门
No one can open that door without the key.

674
00:38:43,414 --> 00:38:45,187
钥匙已经不见了
The key is gone.

675
00:38:45,188 --> 00:38:48,448
温迪 别再担心了
Wendy, stop worrying.

676
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,055
好吧 要担心的事还多着呢
Well, it's a lot to worry about.

677
00:38:55,393 --> 00:38:57,728
什么?
What?

678
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:02,799
你的项链... 变红了
Your necklace... it's red.

679
00:39:06,486 --> 00:39:09,821
这是你最后一条命了
This is your last life.

680
00:39:22,153 --> 00:39:24,454
我需要更多的能量
I need more power.

681
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,695
有了
Yes.

682
00:40:27,419 --> 00:40:29,664
谢天谢地...
Thank God...
