1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,200
没人相信爱丽丝
No one believed Alice

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,790
所说的仙境冒险
when she spoke of her adventures in Wonderland,

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,730
她是如何爱上了精灵塞勒斯
of how she fell in love with a genie named Cyrus,

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,770
-红心王后又是如何拆散了他们  -不
- and how the Red Queen tore them apart. - No!

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,740
她被关进了精神病院
She was locked away in an asylum.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,740
爱丽丝  她需要帮助
Alice. She needs help.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,730
所以红桃杰克和我带她回了仙境
So the Knave of Hearts and I brought her back to Wonderland

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,130
寻找她的真爱
to search for her true love.

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,030
他在这里  我能感觉到
He's here. I can feel it.

10
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,210
有人想阻止她
There are those who will try to stop her.

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,070
让那个女孩许下三个愿
What we want can't be accomplished

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,030
我们的目的才能达成
until the girl's made all her wishes.

13
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,930
但是爱丽丝的伟大冒险
But Alice's greatest adventure

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,460
才刚刚开始
has just begun.

15
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,220
多年前  阿格拉巴

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,430
有什么能效劳的
Can I help you?

17
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,950
很快就能知道了
We shall soon find out.

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,690
你是法西・沙麦德
You are Farzeen Shahmed?

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,330
在市集上卖围巾
You work in the marketplace selling scarves.

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,520
对
Yes.

21
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,500
您想买一条吗
Uh... would you like one?

22
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,570
我能挑挑吗
May I?

23
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,510
你赚的钱很少
You earn very little income,

24
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,740
但家里还真是设备齐全
and yet your home is well-appointed.

25
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,200
谢谢你
Thank you.

26
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,900
这不是恭维  而是我亲眼所见的而已
It was not a compliment, but an observation.

27
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,430
你花园里种了大量新鲜蔬菜
You have a bounty of fresh vegetables in your garden,

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,930
我还发现你家外面有两头骆驼
and I couldn't help noticing you have two camels outside.

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,220
阿格拉巴甚至很少有人能买得起一头
Few men in Agrabah can afford even one.

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,010
而你  却有两头
And yet here you are... with two.

31
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,530
我很幸运
I have been very fortunate.

32
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,660
确实如此
Indeed.

33
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,610
看来你拥有一个人所希望的一切
It seems you have everything a man could possibly wish for.

34
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,650
也许你遇见了能赠与愿望的人
Perhaps you've met someone who could grant them.

35
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,220
那些愿望
Wishes.

36
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,350
我不知道你在说什么
I am not sure what you mean.

37
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,810
我的财富是源于家族投资
My good fortune is... due to a family investment

38
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,760
现在终于财源滚滚了
that has finally begun to pay off.

39
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,110
是这样吗
Is that so?

40
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,170
对
Yes.

41
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,040
我还能更解释得跟详细些
I can explain further, if you'll

42
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,130
但我得先去关掉炉子
allow me to turn off the stove.

43
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,180
好啊
Yes.

44
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,330
当然  水烧过了就不好了
Yes. We wouldn't want you to overcook water.

45
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,000
去吧
Go on.

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,990
精灵
Genie.

47
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,090
我的主人  你的愿望就是我的愿望
Master mine, my will is thine.

48
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,520
他来了  你说的那个人
He's here! The one you spoke of.

49
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,740
拿着毒蛇杖的人
The man with the serpent staff.

50
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,040
别紧张  他要找的不是你
Steady. It's not you he's after.

51
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,920
我的第三个愿望  我现在就要实现它
My third wish! I want it now.

52
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,310
耐心点  我能帮助你
Have patience. I can help you.

53
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,110
-我希望你消失  -不要
- I wish you gone! - Don't!

54
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,020
远远离开阿格拉巴  就像地球远离太阳
As far from Agrabah as the earth from the sun!

55
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,820
不
No!

56
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,190
你把他送到哪里去了
Where did you send him?

57
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,690
我不知道
I don't know!

58
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,760
求你了
Please!

59
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,200
你想要什么
What is it you desire?

60
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,220
饶我一命
Just... mercy!

61
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,800
那么
Well, then...

62
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,810
看来今天我俩都不能
it seems neither of us are going to get

63
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,010
如愿以偿了
what we want today.

64
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,560
我在哪
Where am I?

65
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,690
什么鬼东西
What the bloody hell?

66
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,580
很好  你醒了
Good. You're up.

67
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,120
你在干什么
What are you doing?

68
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,430
我在做准备
I'm getting ready.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,070
我的技艺有些生疏了
I'm a bit rusty.

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,230
好了  你把树刺伤了
There. Now you've gone and hurt the tree.

71
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,250
高兴了吧
Happy?

72
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,550
找回了塞勒斯  我才会高兴
I'll be happy once we get Cyrus back.

73
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,970
我们得走了
We need to get moving.

74
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,900
我们在仙境待了太长时间
We've been in Wonderland for too long.

75
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,400
敌人会发现我们的
Our enemies know we're here.

76
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,300
"敌人"  那会是谁
"Our enemies"? Who would they be?

77
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,550
好问题  来吧
Excellent question. Come on.

78
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,060
我有个计划  杰克
I have a plan, Knave.

79
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,930
还有一身新衣服
And a new outfit.

80
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,800
从哪弄来的
Where'd you get that?

81
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,180
晾衣架经过了
The clotheshorse came by.

82
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,250
当然啦
Of course it did.

83
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,910
我们最大的问题是不知道塞勒斯在哪
Our biggest problem is we don't know where Cyrus is.

84
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,000
他可能被困在某地了  或者被抓住了
He could be trapped somewhere, or--or captured.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,800
咖啡架有没有可能经过啊
Look, is there any chance of a coffee horse coming by?

86
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,510
-我没法思考  直到...  -然后我意识到
- I can't really think until-- - But then I realized

87
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,240
我们不需要知道他在哪里
we don't need to know where he is.

88
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,430
-不需要吗  -因为我们知道一件
- Oh, we don't? - Because we know something.

89
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,520
别人都不知道的事
Something nobody else does.

90
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,330
我们知道瓶子藏在哪
We know where the bottle is hidden.

91
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,820
看来你不知道"我们"这词是什么意思
I'm not sure you're clear on what the word "We" means.

92
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,070
这是两步式计划  第一步  我们找到瓶子
It's a two-step plan. Step one--we find the bottle.

93
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,370
第二部  我们许三个无害的愿望
Step two--we make three harmless wishes,

94
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,100
不管他在哪  他就会被收回瓶子里
and no matter where he is, he'll just get drawn back inside.

95
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,110
我记得你说过没有什么
I thought you said there's no such thing

96
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,140
无害的愿望
as a harmless wish.

97
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,350
对  那是对大愿望而言
True. That's if you wish for something big.

98
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,130
但如果你许下某些微不足道的小愿望
But if you wish for something small and innocent,

99
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,540
比如要个纸杯蛋糕  那应该没事
like a cupcake, it should be fine.

100
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,660
这就要说到你了
Which, um, brings us to you.

101
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,670
终于来了
Here it comes.

102
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,790
你要摩擦瓶子
You'll rub the bottle,

103
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,920
塞勒斯就会重新出现  我们就可以再在一起了
and Cyrus will reappear, and we'll be together again.

104
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,330
然后我们再想办法
And then we'll figure out a way to truly free him

105
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,450
让他永远自由
once and for all.

106
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,290
爱丽丝  如果我擦了瓶子
Um, Alice, once I rub the bottle,

107
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,070
那塞勒斯不就是我的精灵了吗
doesn't that make Cyrus my genie?

108
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,480
看来我只得相信你了
I guess I'll just have to trust you.

109
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,710
那好吧
Right then.

110
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,670
我们去哪找这瓶子
Where do we find this bottle?

111
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,690
我们把它埋在了高耸弦树的
We buried it in the Mimsy Meadows,

112
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,350
密草地下
under the towering TumTum Tree.

113
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,090
没人会去那里
It's a place where nobody goes.

114
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,720
取了这种名字  谁会去啊
With a name like that, why would they,

115
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,940
除非是爱心熊
unless they were a care bear?

116
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,650
爱心熊是什么
What's a care bear?

117
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,390
当我没说
Never mind.

118
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,190
你来叫醒他还是我来
You want to wake him or should I?

119
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,630
让他睡吧  可怜的兔子够累的了
Leave him be. Poor Rabbit's been through enough.

120
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,050
其实爱丽丝的意思就是  他拖了我们后退
Which is Alice-speak for "He's slowing us down."

121
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,300
走吧  杰克
Come on, Knave.

122
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,620
该去找瓶子了
Time to get the bottle.

123
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,760
该去找塞勒斯了
Time to get Cyrus.

124
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,710
爱丽丝
Alice?

125
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,540
怎么了  你没事吧
What's going on over there? You all right?

126
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,260
一个一个说
One at a time.

127
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,900
女王陛下要你们遵守秩序
Her majesty demands order.

128
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,610
供水快断了
The water supply's running out.

129
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,030
我的庄稼快死了
My crops are dying!

130
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,590
请您帮帮我们
Please, help us!

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,150
亲爱的子民  跟你们说实话吧
Darlings, can I be honest with you?

132
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,910
你们的问题很无聊
Your problems bore me.

133
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,700
亲爱的贾法尔
Dear Jafar...

134
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,460
现身吧  不管你在哪里
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

135
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,930
不知道你怎么忍受得了这些人的
I don't know how you can stand to listen to them,

136
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,690
日复一日
day in, day out.

137
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,370
我是女王
I'm the queen.

138
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,830
这是我的职责
It's my job.

139
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,750
这是你的弱点  你想赢得他们的尊敬
It's your flaw. You were trying to earn their respect.

140
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,670
但你需要做的只是强占
All you have to do is take it.

141
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,120
我夺来了这王冠和仙境
I took this throne. I took wonderland.

142
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,120
但你还是不满足  对吧
And yet, still it's not enough, is it?

143
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,590
要是咱俩之中有一个人满足于现状
I think if either of us were satisfied with what we already had,

144
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,010
又怎么会去跟
we wouldn't be messing about

145
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,220
爱丽丝和她的精灵纠缠呢
with Alice and her genie, now, would we?

146
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,460
要是你不能帮我找到瓶子
If you can't find that bottle for me,

147
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,550
也许这一切都是浪费时间
then maybe this is just a waste of time.

148
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,230
事实上  我才更担心
Actually, I am more concerned whether it is you

149
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,940
名不副实的人是你
who can do what you say you can.

150
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,800
有了精灵瓶子的力量
With the bottle's power,

151
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,550
你是否就真能改变魔法的法则
will you indeed be able to change the laws of magic?

152
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,350
为了化不可能
To make the impossible...

153
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,350
为可能
possible,

154
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,550
你必须有些邪恶的渴望
you must have some truly unholy desires.

155
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,790
我有
Oh, that I do.

156
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,760
你能做到吗
Can you do it?

157
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,280
当然
Of course.

158
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,160
但我们现在还没拿到瓶子
But this talk is foolishly premature

159
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,550
一切都言之尚早
until we have the bottle.

160
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,200
别再在这些农民身上浪费时间了
So why don't you stop wasting time with these peasants

161
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,420
集中精神完成眼下的任务
and focus on the task at hand?

162
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,010
不管我喜不喜欢  我始终是女王  贾法尔
Whether I like it or not, Jafar, I am the queen.

163
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,910
我肩上承担着责任
I have responsibilities.

164
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,300
好了
There.

165
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,110
我已经帮你把今天空出来了
I've cleared your day.

166
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,800
找到精灵的瓶子
Now find the bottle

167
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,910
我就能让爱丽丝许愿了
so I can get Alice to make those wishes...

168
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,640
你也可以用琴声好好收拾她了
And you can have your tweedles sweep her up, too.

169
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,000
继续找  好吗
Keep up, would you?

170
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,330
现在干得不错
We're making good time.

171
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,390
照这速度下去
If we keep at this pace,

172
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,280
中午之前就能到密草地了
we'll arrive at Mimsy Meadows before midday.

173
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,980
你还是小点声吧
You may want to lower your voice.

174
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,010
这里隔墙有耳  是真的耳朵
The walls in this place have ears--literally.

175
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,570
这里的墙都长了耳朵
There are walls with actual ears.

176
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,640
你不会想让整个仙境都知道你要去哪的
You don't want all of wonderland to know where we're going.

177
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,720
当然
Of course not.

178
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,980
你在想  如果我们找到了他该怎么办
You're thinking about what happens if we find him?

179
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,120
一定会找到他
When.

180
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,940
一定会
When we find him.

181
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,160
要是跟你想的不一样呢
What if it's nothing like you thought?

182
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,790
什么意思
Meaning?

183
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,350
我只是想保护你
Well... I just think to protect yourself,

184
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,510
你得考虑到这种可能性
you should consider the possibility

185
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,180
现实也许跟你想的不同
that things may be different.

186
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,140
你离开了很久
You've been gone a long time.

187
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,760
塞勒斯在等我  他需要我
Cyrus is waiting for me. He needs me.

188
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,340
那他为什么不联系你
Then why hasn't he contacted you?

189
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,970
要是你知道他在哪  那他也一定知道你在哪
If you know where he is, surely he knows where you are, too.

190
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,500
他不联系我唯一的理由
The only reason he hasn't contacted me

191
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,110
就是他有麻烦了
is because he must be in trouble.

192
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,880
所以我们得抓紧
That's why we need to pick up the pace.

193
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,870
也许他已经重新开始了
Or he's moved on.

194
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,000
不可能  我和塞勒斯之间...
Not a chance. What Cyrus and I have--

195
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,160
说了你也不明白
Well, you wouldn't understand.

196
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,200
是啊  我是不明白
No. I suppose I wouldn't.

197
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,740
没什么能阻挡我们在一起
Nothing will get in the way of us being together.

198
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,260
除了这个
Except possibly this.

199
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,830
用力
Harder.

200
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,730
再用力
Harder.

201
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,010
用力
Harder!

202
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,550
兔子
Bunny!

203
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,000
有什么消息
What news do you have for me?

204
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,790
一切都如您所料  按部就班地进行着
Everything is moving along as you predicted.

205
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,700
他们今早离开  去找精灵的瓶子了
They left this morning to get the genie's bottle.

206
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,070
那你知道瓶子在哪了
So you know where it is then.

207
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,290
我...
Uh, I, uh...

208
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,780
要我提醒你欺骗我的后果吗
Need I remind you of the consequences if you lie to me?

209
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,640
不用了  我知道瓶子在哪
Uh, no. Uh... I know exactly where it is.

210
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,240
我们应该能游过去
I suppose we could swim across.

211
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,330
不行
No, we can't.

212
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,710
要是你担心水下有什么危险
If you're afraid of dangers

213
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,230
我可以处理...
lurking beneath the surface, I can handle--

214
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,340
我不会游泳
I can't swim.

215
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,090
你怎么可能这辈子都没...
How have you lived your whole life and never--

216
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,160
-我在忙其它事  -比如呢
- I was doing other things. - Like what?

217
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,590
比如怕水  爱丽丝
Like being afraid of water, Alice.

218
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,040
好吧  那我们等摆渡吧
Fine. We'll just have to wait for the ferry.

219
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,350
有个更好的主意  走过去
Or--better idea-- we walk...

220
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,740
绕道而行
We walk around it.

221
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,130
绕过整个湖
Walk around the entire thing?

222
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,970
那至少要花两天
That would take two days at least.

223
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,770
我们摆渡过去
We're taking the ferry.

224
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,110
她来了
There she is.

225
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,120
在这儿呢  仙女
Over here, fairy.

226
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,090
我是水仙子  你们要...
I am the Fairy Silvermist. Where may I...

227
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,040
我...
I...

228
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,770
你好啊  小水
Hey, Silv.

229
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,870
最近怎么样
How's it going?

230
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,410
-好了  -你俩  认识吧
- There it is. - I take it you two... know each other.

231
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,460
你还敢在仙境露面啊
Awfully bold of you to show your face in wonderland.

232
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,400
你知道有多少人在找你吗
Do you know how many people are looking for you?

233
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,770
好不如去数数有多少人不在找我
Might be easier to figure out how many aren't.

234
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,740
很好笑吗
You think you're funny?

235
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,970
我认为  不管我现在说什么都没用
I think I'm buggered no matter what I say right now.

236
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,180
也许你俩可以在
Perhaps you two might continue reminiscing

237
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,020
我们渡河的时候再叙旧
while we make our way across the lake.

238
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,570
看来我们只能走过去了
I think we have to walk.

239
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,470
不  我很乐意送你们过去
Not at all. I'm happy to take you.

240
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,020
我们俩吗  真的吗
The both of us? Are you sure?

241
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,800
当然  这是我的职责  我很专业
Of course. It's my job, and I'm a professional.

242
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,710
不会让私人感情影响工作
I don't let feelings get in the way of my work,

243
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,670
尤其是那些早已不上心的旧感情
especially old feelings that I've completely moved on from.

244
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,750
好吧  非常感谢
Okay. Thank you very much.

245
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,800
是啊  非常感谢
Yeah, thank you very much.

246
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,820
非常好  我们要去
Excellent. Well, then we need to

247
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,180
高耸弦树下的密草地
get to The Tumtum Tree in Mimsy Meadows.

248
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,980
干嘛  我要告诉她我们的去向
What? I need to tell her where we're going.

249
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,030
别担心  你可以相信我
Don't worry. You can trust me.

250
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,380
我是来帮忙的
I'm here to help.

251
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,290
你被棒子打到的烙印
That burn you got from the bars--

252
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,060
我现在开始明白
I'm starting to understand

253
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,760
为什么只有你的笼子是用银制成的
why yours is the only cage made of silver.

254
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,550
是为了防止你逃跑吗
Is that to keep you from escaping?

255
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,480
是为了杜绝我有逃跑的想法
It's to keep me from even thinking of escaping.

256
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,430
精灵和银器  我们很不合
Genies and silver-- we don't mix.

257
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,880
也许我们可以让你忘却痛苦
Perhaps we can take your mind off the pain.

258
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,450
上次下的是
Last move

259
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,270
车上D3
was rook to D3.

260
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,960
老人家抱歉  我今天不能和你玩
Sorry, old man. I can't play with you today.

261
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,230
你还有更重要的事做吗
You have something better to do?

262
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,640
是的
Yes.

263
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,420
还真的有
Actually... I do.

264
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,550
我亲爱的小姐  你的愿望就是我的愿望
Mistress mine, my will is thine.

265
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,700
打开你的手
Open your hand.

266
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,370
-什么  -你的手  打开看看
- What? - Your hand. Open it.

267
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,450
这些是什么
What are these?

268
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,030
它们是你的愿望
They're your wishes.

269
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,630
好漂亮
Ah, they're so pretty.

270
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,810
你也很漂亮
As are you.

271
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,480
忘记我了吗
Forget about me?

272
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,530
抱歉  兔子
Oh. Sorry, Rabbit.

273
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,660
没有不舒服吧
No hard feelings?

274
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,870
没有  都是我的错
No, I suppose it's my fault.

275
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,210
我从一开始就不该把你带来
I never should have led you down here in the first place.

276
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,340
现在你惹了一身麻烦
It's been nothing but trouble for you.

277
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,760
你没把我丢在这  是我跟着你来的
You didn't leave me here. I followed you.

278
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,920
你一直是个好奇心强的女孩
You always were a curious girl.

279
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,510
爱丽丝  祝你好运
Good luck, Alice.

280
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,440
那现在怎么办
So what happens now?

281
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,400
任何愿望
Anything.

282
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,750
一切愿望
Everything.

283
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,470
我能许下任何愿望吗
So I can wish for anything I want?

284
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,710
有几个限制条件
There are a few restrictions.

285
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,370
可以说是魔法的法则
The laws of magic, as it were.

286
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,050
-魔法的法则  -是
- Laws of magic? - Yes.

287
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,690
有四条  我不能杀人
There are four of them. I can't kill anyone.

288
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,310
不能让死人复生
I can't bring anything back from the dead.

289
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,790
不能改变历史
I can't change the past.

290
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,170
也不能让任何人坠入爱河
And I can't make anyone fall in love.

291
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,400
合情合理
Reasonable enough.

292
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,290
第三个愿望之后会怎么样
After the third wish, what happens then?

293
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,250
我回到瓶子里
I get returned to my bottle,

294
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,890
然后其他人再次找到我
and then someone else finds me.

295
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,370
所以你的一生
So you spend your entire life--

296
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,230
就是为主人享乐而存在
Serving at the pleasure of my masters.

297
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:07,860
是的
Yes.

298
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,860
如果我希望
What if I wish...

299
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,630
你能得到自由呢
for your freedom?

300
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,090
已经试过了
I-it's been tried,

301
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,420
结果却是两败俱伤
and it's never gone well for either party.

302
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,290
愿望总是要付出代价的  爱丽丝
Wishes come with a cost, Alice.

303
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,980
许下的愿望越大  承受的后果就越大
The bigger the wish, the greater the consequence.

304
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,460
听起来很危险
Sounds dangerous.

305
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,110
我觉得  你就是喜欢带点危险感的东西
I get the feeling you like a little danger.

306
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,030
你还不知道要许下什么愿望
You're still not sure what to wish for.

307
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,390
也许我们可以
Perhaps we could...

308
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,620
走一走
take a walk.

309
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,880
我可以给你些建议
I can give you some suggestions.

310
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,850
非常乐意
I'd like that very much.

311
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,400
我不得不承认  我喜欢在天上飞
I must admit, I do enjoy the flying.

312
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,520
你一直喜欢飞
You always did.

313
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,950
不论如何  小水
For what it's worth, Sil,

314
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,470
其他的事我也喜欢
I enjoyed some of the other bits as well.

315
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,350
比不上我现在要享受的
Not nearly as much as I'm going to enjoy this.

316
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,280
威尔
Will!

317
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,660
我盼这一天已经很久了
I can't tell you how long I've been waiting for that.

318
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,940
你怎么能
How could you--

319
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,190
相信我  这是他活该
Trust me. He deserved it.

320
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,000
可我们得去救他  他不会游泳
But we have to get him! He can't swim!

321
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,700
抱歉  不能绕路
Sorry. No detours.

322
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,530
见鬼
Oh, bloody hell!

323
00:17:59,090 --> 00:17:59,950
救命
Help!

324
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,580
你对那小仙女做过什么
What did you do to that fairy?

325
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,490
我对她做过什么了
What did I do to her?

326
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,950
她刚把我扔进这该死的湖里
She just tossed me into the bloody lake!

327
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,650
显然你罪有应得
Which you clearly deserved.

328
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,540
现在我们困在荒无人烟的地方
Now we're stuck in the middle of nowhere,

329
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,320
全都怪你伤了一个小仙女的心
all because you broke a fairy's heart.

330
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,510
她一开始就不应该给出她的心
Well, she shouldn't have given it away in the first place.

331
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,630
威尔  没人能控制自己的情感
People can't help falling in love, Will.

332
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,330
能控制
Sure, they can.

333
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,380
只要半夜偷跑出来
You just sneak out in the middle of the night,

334
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,090
穿上裤子  拿上钥匙  一去不回头
grab your trousers, your keys, and don't ever look back.

335
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,310
你怎么会这样
How did you get this way?

336
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,320
-谁这样对你了  -这与我无关  爱丽丝
- Who did this to you? - This isn't about me, Alice.

337
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,080
就算是  我也是坐在家里
If it were, I'd be sat back at home,

338
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,400
开心地看着电视
happily watching the telly.

339
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,060
别问了
Don't ask.

340
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,940
我想告诉你的是
Look, all I'm trying to tell you is,

341
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,840
你的脑中记录着对塞勒斯的记忆
you've got this picture of Cyrus in your mind,

342
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,470
都是一些美好细致的小回忆
these perfect little memories of how things were.

343
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,340
但也许那只是你一厢情愿
But maybe that's just how they were for you.

344
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,780
不是这样的
It wasn't like that.

345
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,440
而且如果你真这么认为
And if you really believe that,

346
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,870
那我们来这干嘛
what are we doing here?

347
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,240
这是你的任务  爱丽丝  不是我的
This is your quest, Alice, not mine.

348
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,950
我是冲着愿望来的
I'm in it for the wish,

349
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,350
就和别的那些寻找精灵的人一样
just like everybody else looking for a genie.

350
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,310
有什么事吗
Is something wrong?

351
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,590
你看起来有些紧张
You seem a little on edge.

352
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,320
抱歉
Sorry.

353
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,250
做精灵就如同通缉犯似的
Being a genie is a lot like being a wanted man.

354
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,170
总是有人在找你
Someone's always after you.

355
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,650
你知道是谁在找你吗
Do you know who that "someone" is?

356
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,150
目前有个叫贾法尔的人
At the moment, a man called Jafar.

357
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,650
他带着一根蛇头魔杖
He carries this staff with the head of a serpent.

358
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,930
如果你看见他
If you ever see him...

359
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:45,970
怎么了
What?

360
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,240
希望你永远不要遇见他
Well, let's just hope you never do.

361
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,720
他想要什么
What does he want with you?

362
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,790
所有人梦寐以求
What everyone wants.

363
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,660
却得不到的
What they don't have.

364
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,720
你不必因为我而留在外面
You don't have to stay out here on my account.

365
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,510
如果你在瓶子里更安全  那你该...
If you're safe in your bottle, you should--

366
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,940
不  我很长时间
No. This is the closest thing

367
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,870
没有这么接近自由了
I've had to freedom in a long time.

368
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,340
我也一样
I could say the same.

369
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,260
如果你的家就像个囚牢
If your home is such a prison,

370
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,780
为什么你还要回去
why make it your mission to return?

371
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,140
我没别的地方可去了
I have nowhere else to go.

372
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,500
这世界每个角落你都可以去  爱丽丝
You have the whole world, Alice.

373
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,760
我可以带你去
I can show it to you.

374
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,900
你只要许愿就可以了
All you have to do is wish.

375
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,810
但我还有很多问题
But I have more questions.

376
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,430
你还想知道什么
What else would you like to know?

377
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,770
一切
Everything.

378
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,280
你遇见的人  你做过的事
The people you've met, the things you've done--

379
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,620
你斩杀过龙吗
Have you ever slain a dragon?

380
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,670
杀过一次  可我不推荐你做这个
Once. I can't recommend it.

381
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,220
这需要灵巧的剑术
It required some deft swordplay.

382
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,390
我一直都不是很会用剑
I've never been comfortable with a sword.

383
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,370
你一直都不是很会用剑吗
You've never felt comfortable with a sword?

384
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,120
那这么久  你是怎么生存下来的
Then how have you survived here all of this time?

385
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,090
还有别的战斗方法
There's other ways to fight.

386
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,370
而且在仙境里  你只需要
And in wonderland, you just

387
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,940
敢于创造
have to be... creative.

388
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,910
就像这样吗
Like this?

389
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,950
真漂亮
It's beautiful.

390
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,810
而且闻起来真的有玫瑰花香
And it actually smells like a rose.

391
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,000
这是魔法纸
It's magic paper.

392
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,380
是我在旅行中弄到的小东西
A little something I picked up on my travels.

393
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,110
看来你去过很多地方
You've traveled a lot, I take it.

394
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,730
的确  这是跟随诸多主人的代价
Indeed. It's the price of many masters.

395
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,720
我从没在一个地方待过很久
I'm never in one place very long.

396
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,670
他们许下自己的愿望  然后就...
They make their wishes, and then they just...

397
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:21,600
继续生活
move on.

398
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,260
我知道那种感觉
I'm afraid I know the feeling.

399
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,270
那种被丢下的感觉
I know what it's like to be moved on from.

400
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,160
我不大相信有人会丢下你
I find it hard to imagine anyone wanting to move on from you.

401
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,510
真奇妙
Amazing.

402
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,360
你能教我吗
Can you teach me?

403
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,220
那就教你折纸
An origami lesson shall be yours.

404
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,880
实际上...
Actually...

405
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,940
我是指剑术
I meant the swordplay.

406
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,500
那个精灵的瓶子
The genie's bottle.

407
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,830
你知道它在哪儿
You have knowledge of its whereabouts.

408
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,680
你们才刚刚确立了关系  寒暄就已经省了吗
Dispensing of pleasantries so early on in our relationship?

409
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,040
真悲剧
How tragic.

410
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,270
我们没有什么关系
This is not a relationship,

411
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,260
而且我很忙
and I'm a very busy man.

412
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,500
你一直这么说
So you keep saying.

413
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,410
但在我看来  所有的工作都是我在做
Yet it appears to me that I am the one doing all the work.

414
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,880
是我把爱丽丝重新带回仙境
I brought Alice back to Wonderland,

415
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,980
并找出瓶子藏在哪儿了
and I found out where the bottle is hidden.

416
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,790
在哪儿
Where?

417
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,990
我很愿意告诉你  贾法尔
I'm happy to share that information with you, Jafar.

418
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,900
但首先  我们得谈一谈
But first, I feel like we need a little chat.

419
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,010
我也有想要的东西
I have needs.

420
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,910
要想让我开始下一步的行动
Before I am happy to play another hand in the game,

421
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,080
你得证明你能满足我的需要
I need proof that you can satisfy them.

422
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,700
你需要的  我的姑娘
What you need, my girl...

423
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,140
就是闭嘴
is to be quiet.

424
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,820
你需要的...
What you need...

425
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,320
就是不要动
is to be still.

426
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,140
安静  听从命令
Silent. Follow orders.

427
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,790
最重要的是
Most of all, be grateful

428
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,860
心怀感激  因为我还让你活着
for the air I'm allowing you to breathe.

429
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,360
我们不是合作伙伴
We're not partners.

430
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,860
我什么也不欠你的
I don't owe you anything.

431
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,940
我给过你承诺
I have given you my word,

432
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,670
这就足够了
and that is more than most ever receive.

433
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,560
听明白了吗
Is that clear?

434
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,470
让我来帮帮你
Let me help you with that.

435
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,270
听明白了吗
Is that clear?

436
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,770
告诉我瓶子在哪儿
Tell me where the bottle is.

437
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,350
密草地
Mimsy meadows,

438
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,930
在高耸弦树下
beneath the towering TumTum Tree.

439
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,060
你看
See?

440
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,270
我们合作很愉快嘛
We make a wonderful team.

441
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,920
我们永远也到不了了
We're never gonna make it there.

442
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,170
还有很远的路要走
It's miles and miles away.

443
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:01,910
的确
True.

444
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,340
有点儿令人灰心  这我承认
This is a bit of a setback, I'll give you that.

445
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,810
但我相信  会找到别的方法的
But I'm sure we'll find another way.

446
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,520
怎么找
How?

447
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,100
给我一分钟
Give me a minute.

448
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,190
两分钟
Two minutes.

449
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,550
我们没有两分钟了  威尔
We don't have two minutes, Will.

450
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,230
我们今天就得到
We need to get there today!

451
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,910
这到底是什么
What the bloody hell was that then?

452
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,020
不知道
I don't know.

453
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,520
这算什么岛
What kind of an island is this?

454
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,100
这不是一个岛
This isn't an island.

455
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,070
什么
What?

456
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,030
抓紧
Hold on tight.

457
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,130
-抓紧  抓什么  -什么都行
- Tight? To what? - Anything.

458
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,290
爱丽丝
Alice!

459
00:24:58,990 --> 00:24:59,990
痒吗
Did that tickle?

460
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,340
海龟
A turtle?

461
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,360
如果你还想要你的脑袋
If you want to keep your head,

462
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,300
那就赶紧带我们去目的地
I suggest you take me where I want to go!

463
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,070
好孩子
Good boy.

464
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,150
现在出发
Now go!

465
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,800
对于不是很会用剑的人来说
For someone who's not comfortable with a sword,

466
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,890
你表现得非常好
you're quite good.

467
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,160
我哪天一定要去弄把剑
I must get one of these someday.

468
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,210
不  这不是一个愿望
No, that's not a wish.

469
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,010
你现在需要做的就是学会用剑
Now all you have to do is learn how to use it.

470
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,990
漂亮  现在握松些
Well done. Now loosen your grip.

471
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,460
你持剑的方式就像个街头混混
You're holding it like a street fighter.

472
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,320
好多了
Better.

473
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,100
你一直学得这么快吗
Have you always been such a quick study?

474
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,610
我不到一周就学会了
I learned how to play Mozart's "Sonata in C"

475
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,120
莫扎特的C大调鸣奏曲
in under a week.

476
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,700
真神奇  怎么学的
Amazing. How?

477
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,660
我妈妈以前常弹  至少别人是这么说的
My mother used to play. Or so I was told.

478
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,000
她在我出生时去世了
She died when I was born.

479
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,920
我想如果我要是能学会弹琴  和她一样
I thought if I learnt to play like her,

480
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,340
就会让我父亲开心
it would make my father happy.

481
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,150
他开心了吗
Did it?

482
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,620
失去了心爱的人
It's hard to be happy again

483
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,030
就很难再开心了
when you've lost someone you love.

484
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,770
抱歉
Sorry.

485
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,430
我不是有意的
I didn't mean to.

486
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,160
没关系
Don't be.

487
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,650
我现在怎么办
What do I do now?

488
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,890
就是你常做的
Same thing you've always done.

489
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,360
随机应变
Be creative.

490
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:49,870
当对手也富有创造力时
It's hard to be creative

491
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,940
就很难随机应变了
when your opponent's uncommonly creative, too.

492
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,880
我想关键就是
Well, I suppose the trick

493
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,980
永远比对手技高一筹
is to always be smarter than your opponent,

494
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,230
也就是说你要清楚对手是谁
which means you have to know who you're up against.

495
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,290
我会记住的
I'll remember that.

496
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,300
那么  爱丽丝  现在怎么办
So, Alice, what now?

497
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,760
我觉得我熟悉我的对手
I think I know my opponent.

498
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,180
我知道他的弱点
I think I know his weakness.

499
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:07,920
真的吗
Really?

500
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,170
但愿我没错
I hope so.

501
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,560
看来我是对的
Looks like I was right.

502
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,230
你磨蹭什么呢
What are you waiting for?

503
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,740
我差点被淹死  又险些被素甲鱼吃掉
I nearly drowned and was eaten by a mock turtle.

504
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,490
我就不能休息一下吗
Can I have a moment, please?

505
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:40,820
不行
Nope.

506
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,620
又是你
You again?

507
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,470
我真高兴你还活着  杰克
I'm actually glad to see you alive, Knave.

508
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,970
怪了  刚才明明是你想杀我
That's strange, since you're the one that tried to kill me.

509
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,650
那是在我得知悬赏你的奖金之前
That was before I heard about the bounty on your head.

510
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,150
看来你把毛虫得罪得不轻啊
Turns out you're in pretty deep to the caterpillar.

511
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,680
好吧  我只是犯了个可怕的错误
Okay, look. I made a horrible mistake.

512
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,740
事实是  你说得没错
The thing is, you were right about everything.

513
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,050
你我之间的事发生后  我感觉糟透了
I felt bloody awful after what happened between us.

514
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,310
即使你有过良心
If you ever had a heart,

515
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,730
现在也早没了
I don't know what happened to it.

516
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:05,960
话说回来
But then again,

517
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,060
说不定是被你亲爱的安娜斯塔西娅用光了
maybe your precious Anastasia used it all up.

518
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,800
你说得对
You're right.

519
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,760
我不觉得难受
I don't feel terrible.

520
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,920
一点都不觉得
Not even a little bit.

521
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,100
但那是因为我再也没有任何感觉了
But that's because I don't feel much of anything anymore.

522
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,890
你我之间的事就是
So why don't we both agree

523
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,500
我是个彻头彻尾的混蛋  咱们就此分道扬镳
that I'm a right bastard and go our separate ways?

524
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,190
不要把毛虫扯进来
We don't need to bring the caterpillar into this.

525
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,570
我为什么要在乎你的命运
Why should I care about your fate?

526
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,440
大可不必
You shouldn't.

527
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,190
但请关心一下她的命运
But care about hers.

528
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,250
她是个正直的人  她爱的男人也是
She's a decent person, and so is the man that she loves,

529
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,160
在我们说话这会儿  他的生命岌岌可危
whose life is literally hanging in the balance as we speak.

530
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,900
不要让好人为坏人犯下的错误付出代价
Don't make the good guys pay for the bad guys' mistakes.

531
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,480
水仙子  我为所做的一切深感抱歉
I am sorry, Silvermist. For everything.

532
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,950
那你走吧
Be on with you, then.

533
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,830
-真的吗  -离开这里  快走
- Really? - Get out of here. Go.

534
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,660
你是在道歉吗
Was that you apologizing?

535
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,240
我也是会道歉的  别深究了
It happens. Don't dwell on it.

536
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,240
走吧
Come on.

537
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,300
谁是安娜斯塔西娅
So who's Anastasia?

538
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,180
谁也不是
Nobody.

539
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,090
不管怎样  还是谢谢你
Well, in any case, thank you.

540
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:31,760
早上好
Good morning.

541
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,610
我遇见你后的每个早上都那么美好
All the mornings are good since I've met you.

542
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,930
咱们今天做什么
So what should we do today?

543
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,700
你提到过的那个地方  沸腾之海
You mentioned that place, the Boiling Sea.

544
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,230
-我总想去...  -爱丽丝
- I've always wanted to-- - Alice.

545
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,030
是时候了
I think it's time.

546
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,090
什么时候
For what?

547
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,580
是时候许愿了
For you to make your wishes.

548
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,320
我做错什么了吗
Did I do something wrong?

549
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,330
没有
No.

550
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,460
事实上  我想象不出你会做错任何事
In fact, I can't imagine you ever doing anything wrong.

551
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,610
这就是问题所在
Which is the problem.

552
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,590
我不明白
I don't understand.

553
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,580
我爱上你了  爱丽丝
I'm falling in love with you, Alice.

554
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:16,790
塞勒斯
Cyrus...

555
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,500
我不能让这种事情发生
I can't allow that to happen.

556
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,840
总有一天  你会许下愿望
Because at some point, you're going to make your wishes

557
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,460
继续自己的生活
and move on with your life.

558
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,100
我又会回到瓶子里
And while I've gotten used to being alone

559
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,560
独自一人度过漫长的岁月
inside this bottle for years at a time,

560
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,770
一想到永恒的时间中将没有你的陪伴
the thought of spending an eternity there without you--

561
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,400
我就觉得难以承受
It's too much for me to bear.

562
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,680
但如果我不许愿
But if I don't make my wishes,

563
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,450
你就永远不用回到瓶子里
you'll never go back inside.

564
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,940
每个人都会许愿
Everyone makes their wishes.

565
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,330
-我不会的  -你现在这么说
- I won't. - You say that now,

566
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,780
但在我无尽的生命历程中
but I've lived countless lifetimes

567
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,910
所有人最终都会许下愿望
and no one has ever not made their wishes.

568
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,760
我为什么要许愿呢
Why would I wish for anything?

569
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:49,030
我已经拥有了想要的一切
I have everything I could possibly wish for.

570
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:53,110
你就是我想要的一切  塞勒斯
You are everything I've ever wished for, Cyrus.

571
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,720
如果你不再爱我了呢
What if you change your mind?

572
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,570
我不会的
I won't.

573
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,920
但如果你变心了呢
But what if you do?

574
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,300
你得相信我
You just have to trust me.

575
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,720
咱们做个交易吧
How about we make a deal?

576
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,530
如果你永远不背弃我的话
I'll never move on from you

577
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,680
我也永远不会背弃你
if you never move on from me.

578
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,420
咱们怎么处理这个
What do you propose we do with this?

579
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,160
咱们把它埋起来
We bury it.

580
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,000
找到那个瓶子
Find the bottle.

581
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,410
等等我
Wait for me!

582
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,930
你不能就自己这么跑了
You can't just go running...

583
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,690
什么情况
What is it?

584
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,580
咱们有伴了
We've got company.

585
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,240
抱歉  爱丽丝  咱们来晚了
I'm sorry, Alice. We're too late.

586
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,070
不  时机刚刚好
Actually, we're just in time.

587
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,900
什么意思
What do you mean?

588
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,200
他快挖完了
He's about to finish digging.

589
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,420
让他挖  瓶子不在那
Let him. The bottle's not here.

590
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,100
从来都不在
Never was.

591
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,160
那咱们为什么来这里
Then, um... then--then why are we here?

592
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,390
我要知道对手是谁
I wanted to know who we're up against,

593
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,230
现在我知道了
and now I do.

594
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,470
这就是为什么
So that's why you kept

595
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,070
你把我们的目的地告诉了所有人
telling everybody where we're headed.

596
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,750
仙境里唯一一条可以依靠的法则
The one thing you can count on in wonderland

597
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,870
就是不能信任任何人
is that you can't count on anyone.

598
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,220
真聪明
You are clever.

599
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,840
他叫贾法尔
His name is Jafar.

600
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,390
你认识他吗
Do you know him?

601
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,860
听说过
I know of him.

602
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,340
等等
Wait a second.

603
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,140
你也没告诉我真相
You didn't tell me the bloody truth, either.

604
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,330
也就是说你也不信任我吗
Does that mean you don't trust me?

605
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,460
至少我现在相信你了
If it helps, I do now.

606
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,920
现在你可以和我一起去了
Which is why you're coming with me.

607
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:12,870
去哪
Where?

608
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,530
去瓶子的真正所在地
To where the bottle is really hidden.

609
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,710
豌豆小路
Passage made of peas.

610
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,010
老虎之塔
Tower of tigers.

611
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,440
风车  就是这里了
The windmill. This is it.

612
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,420
那是蒲公英狮
And there's the Dandelion!

613
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,300
这儿棒极了
These actually aren't half bad.

614
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,260
没人来把你的地标吃了可真是谢天谢地
You're lucky no one came along and ate your bloody landmark.

615
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,870
不
No.

616
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,780
不可能
It's impossible.

617
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,710
瓶子不见了
The bottle, it's gone.

618
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,160
你之前说过的
What you said before--

619
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,710
也许你是对的
maybe you were right.

620
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,040
也许他放弃我了
Maybe he's moved on.

621
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,690
找到她
Find her!

622
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,100
起来
Get up!

623
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,180
站起来  精灵
On your feet, genie.

624
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,340
你想要什么
What do you want?

625
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,550
它在哪里
Where is it?

626
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:53,020
-什么东西  -你知道是什么  瓶子
- What? - You know what. The bottle.

627
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,950
瓶子在哪里
Where is it?

628
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:56,730
继续啊  杀了我
Go ahead. Kill me.

629
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,360
我不需要杀死你
I don't have to kill you.

630
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,230
我会杀死她  当着你的面
I'll kill her... in front of you,

631
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,140
除非你立刻告诉我瓶子在哪里
Unless you tell me where the bottle is immediately.

632
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,940
瓶子在我手里
I have it.

633
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,420
今天早晨你给我的建议真不错
Very good advice you gave me this morning.

634
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,990
我想明白了  要想赢得你的尊重
There was I thinking I needed to earn your respect,

635
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,420
我所需要做的不过是强取
when really all I needed to do was to take it.

636
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,480
瓶子在你手里
You have the bottle?

637
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,960
别再小看我了  贾法尔
Stop underestimating me, Jafar.

638
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,530
你的地牢真是不错
Very nice dungeon you have here.

639
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:32,230
看得出来你很喜欢黑暗
I can really see you enjoy dankness.

640
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,550
这让我想到得告诉你
Remind me to tell you

641
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,810
在身边保留美好之物的重要性
the value of keeping pretty things around.

642
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,290
这里就有一个
There's one.

643
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,840
告诉我瓶子在哪里
Tell me where it is.

644
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,030
游戏规则也该改改了
How about we start with changing the game?

645
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,320
开始启用新规则
Beginning with a new rule.

646
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,840
别再用轻蔑的语气跟我说话
Do not talk down to me anymore!

647
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,190
你瞧  我本打算告诉你瓶子藏在哪儿的
You see, I was planning on telling you where the bottle was hidden.

648
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:58,190
但我又意识到  我不信任你
And then I realized something. I don't trust you.

649
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,220
而我不信任你的理由就是
And the reason I don't trust you--

650
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,560
我们的关系无法惠及双方
because this relationship is not mutually beneficial.

651
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:07,500
你手上有所有的王牌  而我一无所有
What with you holding all the cards and me holding nothing.

652
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,310
但现在已不再如此了  是吗  亲爱的
But all that's changed now, hasn't it, darling?

653
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,890
精灵在你的手上
You have the genie...

654
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,760
而瓶子在我的手上
and I have the bottle.

655
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,700
他已经开始新生活了
He's moved on.

656
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,380
这是唯一合理的解释
It's the only thing that makes sense.

657
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,070
在这个世界上  只有塞勒斯和我
Cyrus and I were the only two people in the world

658
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,720
知道这个瓶子的所在
that knew where that bottle was.

659
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,980
或许并非如此
Or you weren't.

660
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,560
你确定你从没有跟别人提起...
Are you positive that you never mentioned--

661
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,490
从没有
Yes!

662
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,730
也许这整件事只是我的一厢情愿
Maybe this whole thing was a fool's errand,

663
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,800
我就是个傻瓜
and I'm the fool.

664
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:07,500
爱丽丝  我们应该找个藏身处
Alice, we should get some shelter.

665
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,700
这里不安全
It's not safe here.

666
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,030
谁在乎
Who cares?

667
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,360
爱丽丝
Alice?

668
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,840
都还顺利吗
Everything went well then?

669
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,710
非常顺利  谢谢你
Very well, thank you.

670
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,170
那么  接下来
So, then...

671
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,870
怎么了
Yes?

672
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,870
恕我冒昧  女王陛下
All due respect, Your Majesty,

673
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,790
我已经履行了我的义务
I-I fulfilled my obligations.

674
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,760
我超额超质量地完成了我的任务
I-I went above and beyond the call of duty.

675
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,680
没错
It's true.

676
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,310
你的确做到了
Indeed you did.

677
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,080
而您向我承诺过...
And you promised me that if...

678
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,900
承诺就是用来违背的
Promises were made to be broken.

679
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,150
如同我能轻易折断某只
As are the bones of little bunnies

680
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,120
忘记自己正身处危险之中的小兔子的骨头
who forget what they have at stake.

681
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,910
现在  最后再说一遍
Now, for the last time,

682
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,740
在我得到了我所想要的之后
when I get what I want,

683
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,730
你才可以得到你所想要的
you will get what you want.

684
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,060
这个道理有这么难懂吗
Why is it such a difficult concept for everyone?

685
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,350
现在告诉我
Now tell me...

686
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,070
你为何会知道瓶子的真正埋藏地点
how did you really know where that bottle was hidden?

687
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,510
你从没提过
You never did say.

688
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:08,230
我  我看见了他们
I... I saw them...

689
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,470
在我们埋之前  请记住
Before we do this, understand,

690
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,620
和我在一起的生活不会轻松
life with me will not be easy.

691
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,390
没有你的生活才不轻松
Life without you hasn't been easy.

692
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,250
你需要随时保持警惕
You'll always have to keep one eye over your shoulder.

693
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,170
总会有人对我们虎视眈眈
Someone will always be coming.

694
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,010
你真的相信爱情能够强大到给我们自由吗
Do you truly believe that love is powerful enough to give us our freedom?

695
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,380
我相信我们的爱情可以
I believe ours is.

696
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,210
你相信吗  如果你不信的话...
Do you? Because if you don't--

697
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,770
爱丽丝  我告诉过你了
Alice, I've told you,

698
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,710
我永远不会离开你
I will never leave you.

699
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,460
那你还在等什么
What are you waiting for?

700
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,110
疯狂的小屁孩
Crazy kids.

701
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,260
亲爱的  抱歉  我迟到了
Honey! Sorry I'm late!

702
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,750
拜托你赶快睡觉吧
Please go to sleep.

703
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,600
我睡不着  你睡吧
I can't. You sleep.

704
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,000
你思考得这么大声  我怎么睡得着
How can I sleep if you insist on thinking so loudly?

705
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,680
我很抱歉  爱丽丝
I'm sorry, Alice.

706
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,290
我让你有了这个可怕的想法
I put that terrible idea in your head.

707
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,530
别听我的  爱情
Don't listen to me. Love.

708
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,770
我对此一无所知
I don't know nothing about it.

709
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,730
我觉得你知道
I think you do.

710
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,040
安娜斯塔西娅是谁
Who's Anastasia?

711
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:49,230
那是个心碎的故事
That... is a tale of heartbreak.

712
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,720
心碎的是你还是她
Yours or hers?

713
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,380
无论是谁  有什么关系吗
Either way, does it matter?

714
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,740
好了  现在你知道了
So there. You got me.

715
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,540
我的确了解爱情
I do know something about love.

716
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,460
但这并不代表你们俩也会这样
But that doesn't mean I'm right about you two.

717
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,470
你相信你们之间是真爱吗  你和塞勒斯
Do you believe that he truly loves you? Cyrus?

718
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,830
我相信
I did.

719
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,820
那就够了
Well, that's good then.

720
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,760
因为如果他真心爱你
Because when somebody truly loves you,

721
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,360
是绝对无法继续新生活的
they can never move on.

722
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,120
我父亲就做到了
My father did.

723
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,030
你说什么
I'm sorry?

724
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,910
他爱我  但他弃我而去开始了新生活
He loved me, and he moved on.

725
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,820
现在历史又重演了
And now it's happening again.

726
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:59,100
这他妈的是什么鬼东西
What the bloody hell is that?

727
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:08,900
证明
Proof.

728
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,150
挚爱的爱丽丝
My dearest Alice,

729
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,840
我用了几生几世来遇见你
It took several lifetimes to meet you,

730
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,610
却只用了数秒来爱上你
but only seconds to love you.

731
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,650
此爱永不消逝
And it is a love that cannot be broken.

732
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,470
无法被咒语或剑戟磨灭
Not by a thousand spells or swords.

733
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,510
我对你的心亦永不磨灭
So it is with my heart in your hands...

734
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,930
只求你能应允我的一个愿望
that I ask you to grant me one wish.

735
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,560
离开仙境
Leave Wonderland.

736
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,110
这里不安全
You're not safe here,

737
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,180
你也无法救出我
and you cannot save me.

738
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,460
唯一比我身死更糟的事
The only thing worse than my own demise

739
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,990
便是你是因我而死
would be knowing that I have caused yours.

740
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,190
我恳求你回去
I beg you to go home.

741
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,030
记住  我永远与你同在
And know that I am with you always.

742
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,800
我即是你
Forever thine, forever mine...

743
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,630
塞勒斯
Cyrus.

744
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,620
他还活着
He's alive.

745
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:11,790
我还以为你深爱着某人的时候
I thought when you truly loved somebody,

746
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,480
是不需要任何证明的
you didn't need any proof.

747
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,420
的确不需要
You don't,

748
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,670
但有证明总是好的
but it's still nice to have.

749
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,520
我将为你而来

750
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,220
仙

00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,220

752
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,220

00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,220
缘
