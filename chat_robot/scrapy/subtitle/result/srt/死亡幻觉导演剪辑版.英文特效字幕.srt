{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'm going home.

333
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Stupid... "Where are you going?"

334

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'd like to try something new.

335
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Have you ever been hypnotised?

336

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}No.

337
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}When I clap twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?

338

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}- Yes.  - So, tell me about your week.

339

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}I met a girl.

340
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}What is her name?

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}I asked you about school, Donnie.

347

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}I think about fucking a lot during school.

348

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}- You think about your family?  - I just turn down the volume

350
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}and think about fucking Christina Applegate.

351
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}I asked you about your family.

352
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}No.

353

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}I don't think about fucking my family. That's gross.

354
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'd like to hear about your friend Frank.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Did you say I flooded the school?

364
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}- I didn't say shit.  - Yeah, well, they think I did it.

365
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:23,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}If you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about, right?

366
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Fuck you! You know what I think?

367

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}I think you did it.

368
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:48,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Beer and pussy - that's all I need.

369
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:51,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}- We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.  - Smurfette?

370
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Mm-hm. Not some tight-ass Middlesex chick.

371
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:01,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Like, this cute little blonde that'll get down with the guys like Smurfette does.

372
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Smurfette doesn't fuck.

373
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}That's bullshit. Why do you think Papa Smurf made her?

374
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Because the other Smurfs were getting too horny.

375
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:19,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}- Not vanity. I heard he was a homosexual.  - Then she fucks them while vanity watches.

376
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}What about Papa Smurf? He must get some action?

377
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}What he does, he films the gang-bang. Later on, he beats off to the tape.

378
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:34,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}First of all, Papa Smurf didn't create Smurfette. Gargamel did.

379
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:39,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}She was sent as Gargamel's evil spy to destroy the Smurf village,

380
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:43,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}but the overwhelming goodness of the Smurfs transformed her.

381
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}And as for the whole gang-bang scenario, it just couldn't happen!

382
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:56,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Smurfs are asexual. They don't even have reproductive organs under those little pants.

383
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:01,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}That's what's so illogical about being a Smurf.

384
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:06,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}What's the point of living if you don't have a dick?

385
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Donnie, why you gotta get smart on us?

386
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Grandma Death.

387

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Excuse me! Excuse me!

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Yeah.

391
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}- How old is Grandma Death?  - 101.

392
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}She does the same thing every day.

393
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:45,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Just walks back and forth and back and forth to the mailbox.

394

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Nothing ever in there.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}She's going back to the box. We may still have mail.

397
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}- Mail, mail, mail.  - Here it is.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}She became a total recluse.

01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:42,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'm sure you've heard the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.

921
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:46,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}I know. Something about a kiddie porn dungeon...

922
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:49,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}0h, please, please! Don't use those words!

923
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:54,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}It's obviously a conspiracy to destroy an innocent man.

924
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:59,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}I'm spearheading the Jim Cunningham defence campaign.

927

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}As their coach, I was the obvious choice to chaperone them.

928

930
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:27,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}But none of the others are available.

931

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}I don't know, Kitty. It's a bad weekend. Eddie's in New York.

932
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:43,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Rose, I don't know if you realise what an opportunity this is for our daughters!

933
01:35:43,570 --> 01:35:48,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}This has been a dream of Samantha's and all of ours for a long time.

934
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:52,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}I made her lead dancer!

936
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:29,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}Elizabeth will be in charge.

937
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:33,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}She'll drive you to therapy.

938

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}And if you need anything, you promise me that you will call Dr Thurman?

939
01:36:48,890 --> 01:36:52,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?

940

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}It feels wonderful.

941
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:19,630


942
01:37:31,970 --> 01:37:35,730

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\4c&H000000&\b0\i1}I flooded my school and I burned down that pervert's house.
