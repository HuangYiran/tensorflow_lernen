{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charles, you have\nfinally lost your senses.

3
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:19,087
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This venture is impossible.

4
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:22,257
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For some. Gentlemen, the only way to achieve the impossible

5
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:24,259
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is to believe it is possible.

6
00:01:24,343 --> 00:01:26,177
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That kind of thinking could ruin you.

7
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:28,263
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm willing to take that chance.

8
00:01:28,347 --> 00:01:32,934
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Imagine trading posts\nin Rangoon, Bangkok, Jakarta...

9
00:01:38,524 --> 00:01:40,358
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The nightmare again?

10
00:01:45,364 --> 00:01:46,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't be long.

11
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:52,037
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm falling down a dark hole,

12
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:56,416
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then I see strange creatures.

13
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:58,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of creatures?

14
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:05,675
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, there's a dodo bird,a rabbit in a waistcoat, a smiling cat.

15
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,844
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know cats could smile.

16
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,138
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}(SIGHING) Neither did I.

17
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:13,391
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And there's a blue caterpillar.

18
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:16,144
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blue caterpillar.

19
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:21,733
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think I've gone round the bend?

20
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:31,785
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid so.\nYou're mad, bonkers, off your head.

21
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:36,831
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'll tell you a secret.All the best people are.

22
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:41,544
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's only a dream, Alice.Nothing can harm you there.

23
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,865
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you get too frightened,you can always wake up. Like this.

24
00:03:06,237 --> 00:03:07,696
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Must we go?

25
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,741
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.

26
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:13,535
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They will notice.

27
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,997
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's your corset?

28
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:25,213
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And no stockings.

29
00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:26,548
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm against them.

30
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:28,299
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you're not properly dressed.

31
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,885
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's to say what is proper?

32
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,222
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if it was agreed that "proper" was wearing a codfish on your head?

33
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:36,391
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Would you wear it?\n- Alice.

34
00:03:36,475 --> 00:03:39,185
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To me, a corset is like a codfish.

35
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,563
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, not today.

36
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:43,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father would have laughed.

37
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:50,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. I'm tired.\nI didn't sleep well last night.

38
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:53,283
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you have bad dreams again?

39
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,826
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only one.

40
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,872
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's always the same,ever since I can remember.

41
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:01,499
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think that's normal?

42
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:04,294
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't most people have different dreams?

43
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:06,588
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

44
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:17,932
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There. You're beautiful.

45
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:20,059
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, can you manage a smile?

46
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:39,913
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At last. We thought you'd never arrive.

47
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:43,917
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alice, Hamish is waiting to dance with you. Go.

48
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:49,923
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do realize it's well past 4:00.

49
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:51,633
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now everything will have\nto be rushed through.

50
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:54,385
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I am sorry.\n- Oh, never mind!

51
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:02,727
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forgive my wife. She's been planning\nthis affair for over 20 years.

52
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:05,939
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If only Charles were here...

53
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,149
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My condolences.

54
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:12,946
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think of your husband often.He was truly a man of vision.

55
00:05:14,573 --> 00:05:18,159
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you don't think I've taken advantage of your misfortunes.

56
00:05:18,244 --> 00:05:21,704
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course not. I'm pleased that you purchased the company.

57
00:05:23,082 --> 00:05:27,502
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was a fool for not investing in his mad venture when I had the chance.

58
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:30,004
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Charles thought so, too.

59
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:51,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hamish, do you ever tire of quadrille?

60
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:54,946
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On the contrary. I find it invigorating.

61
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,328
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do I amuse you?

62
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:03,454
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

63
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:06,666
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had a sudden vision of all the ladies in trousers

64
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,877
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the men wearing dresses.

65
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:11,796
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you'll do best to keep your visions to yourself.

66
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:14,299
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When in doubt, remain silent.

67
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:25,727
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pardon us, sir.Miss Kingsleigh is distracted today.

68
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:27,478
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's your head?

69
00:06:27,563 --> 00:06:30,481
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was wondering what it would be like to fly.

70
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:31,608
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would you spend your time

71
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}thinking about such an impossible thing?

72
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:35,278
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why wouldn't I?

73
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:38,615
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father said he sometimes believed in six impossible things

74
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:39,824
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before breakfast.

75
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:50,209
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alice, meet me under the gazebo in precisely 10 minutes.

76
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,047
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a secret to tell you.

77
00:06:54,131 --> 00:06:56,174
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're telling me,then it's not much of a secret.

78
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:58,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Perhaps we shouldn't.\n- We decided we should.

79
00:06:58,844 --> 00:06:59,928
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we tell her, she won't be surprised.

80
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:02,931
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Will you be surprised?\n- Not if you tell me.

81
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:04,766
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now you've brought it up,\nyou have to.

82
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,393
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, we don't.\n- In fact, we won't.

83
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:10,104
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wonder if your mother knows

84
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:13,733
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you two swim naked\nin the Havershims' pond.

85
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:16,194
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You wouldn't.\n- Oh, but I would.

86
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:19,364
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's your mother right now.

87
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:21,449
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hamish is going to ask for your hand.

88
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:23,701
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've ruined the surprise!

89
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,454
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could strangle them!

90
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:29,666
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone went to so much effort to keep the secret.

91
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,334
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does everyone know?

92
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:35,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's why they've all come.This is your engagement party.

93
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:39,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hamish will ask you under the gazebo.When you say yes...

94
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:42,178
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I don't know if I want to marry Hamish.

95
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,223
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who, then? You won't do better than a lord.

96
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,605
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll soon be 20, Alice.That pretty face won't last forever.

97
00:07:53,524 --> 00:07:56,567
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't want to end up like Aunt Imogene.

98
00:07:56,652 --> 00:07:59,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you don't want to be a burden on Mother, do you?

99
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:00,321
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

100
00:08:00,406 --> 00:08:02,615
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you'll marry Hamish.

101
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,492
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will be as happy as I am with Lowell,

102

00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:23,469
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know what I've always dreaded?

00:08:23,554 --> 00:08:25,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The decline of the aristocracy?

00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:29,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ugly grandchildren. But you're lovely.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't shout.

123
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:09,974
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, pay attention.\nHamish said you were easily distracted.

124
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,935
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What was I saying?\n- Hamish has a blockage.

00:09:14,313 --> 00:09:18,066
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't be more interested,but you'll have to excuse me.

01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,979
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which would mean that I'm not real.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you will step out alone.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. And one more thing.

911
01:38:39,005 --> 01:38:43,759
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father told me he planned to expand his trade route to Sumatra and Borneo,

912
01:38:43,844 --> 01:38:46,387
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I don't think he was looking far enough.

913
01:38:46,471 --> 01:38:48,806
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not go all the way to China?

914
01:38:49,641 --> 01:38:53,894
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's vast, the culture is rich,and we have a foothold in Hong Kong.

915
01:38:54,729 --> 01:38:58,315
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To be the first to trade with China, can you imagine it?

916
01:39:00,277 --> 01:39:01,902
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, if anybody else had said that to me,

917
01:39:01,987 --> 01:39:04,864
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd say, "You've lost your senses."

918
01:39:05,157 --> 01:39:07,324
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I've seen that look before.

919
01:39:07,451 --> 01:39:11,912
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, as you're not going to be my daughter-in-law,

01:39:11,997 --> 01:39:15,875
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}perhaps you'd consider becoming an apprentice with the company.

921
01:39:55,832 --> 01:39:57,458
