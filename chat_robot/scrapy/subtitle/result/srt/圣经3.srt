109
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,320
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}若苏厄  我们遇到一个女人{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Joshua, we met a woman.{\r}

110
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,860
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}她认为这座城市已经是天主的了{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}She thinks God has taken the city already.{\r}

111
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,680
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}他们知道天主与我们同在{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}The people melt in fear{\r}

112
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,440
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}都陷入恐慌  不战自溃{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}because they know he is with us.{\r}

114
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,740
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}但我们仍要想办法进城{\r}

{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}This is what you must do...{\r}

132
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,840
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}你们所有的战士每天{\r}

133
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,400
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}要围绕这城转一遭{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}with all the armed men.{\r}

136
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,200
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}他将与你们同在{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}and he is with you.{\r}

137
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,560

138
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,630
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}然后司祭用羊角号吹起长声。{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Then the priests should make a long blast with the ram's horn.{\r}

139
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,240
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}你们一听见角声{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet,{\r}

{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}荣耀将会降临{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Glory will come.{\r}

143
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,500
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}他的确是这世界的创造者{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}He truly is the shaper of the world.{\r}

144
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,580
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}我们要把这座城献给主{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}We give this city to the Lord!{\r}

145
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,750
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}耶利哥是我们的{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Jericho is ours!{\r}

146

{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}只有妓女辣哈布与她家中所有人的可以存活{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Only Rahab the prostitute and her family may be spared,{\r}

147
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,520
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}这是天主的旨意{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}for God said she must be spared...{\r}

148
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,630
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}因为她帮助了我们{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}for the help she gave us.{\r}

149
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,990
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}天主兑现了他的承诺{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}God has kept his promise.{\r}

150
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,450
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}只要我们遵从主{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}If we obey Lord,{\r}

151
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,760
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}一切皆有可能{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}anything is possible!{\r}

152
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:37,460
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}以色列  以色列{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Israel! Israel!{\r}

153
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:43,930
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}以色列  以色列{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Israel! Israel!{\r}

154
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,420
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}若苏厄死后一百年{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}A hundred years after Joshua.{\r}

155
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,040
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}以色列十二个部落遍布应许之地{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}The twelve tribes of Israel have spread out across the promised land.{\r}

156
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,340
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}但他们四面楚歌{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}But hostile neighbors surround them.{\r}

157
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,000
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}培肋舍特人武器精良  训练有素{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Better armed and better trained.{\r}

158
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,130
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}是以色列人最致命的威胁{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}The Philistines are the deadliest threat.{\r}

159
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:22,280
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}由于缺少梅瑟和若苏厄这样杰出领袖的领导{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Without great leaders like Moses or Joshua to unite them,{\r}

160
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:28,630
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}以色列人必须倚仗被称为"民长"的本土英雄{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}the Israelites must rely on local heroes called Judges.{\r}

161
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,870
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}三松就是其中之一{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}People like Samson.{\r}

{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}When will this all stop?{\r}

164
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,460
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}我也不知道{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}I don't know.{\r}

165
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,940
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}你必须反抗{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}You must fight them.{\r}

166
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,120
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}那是天主希望你做的  三松{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}It's what God wants you to do, Samson.{\r}

167
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,280
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}那是天主创造你的原因{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}It's why God created you.{\r}

168
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,350
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}记住他的天使跟我说的话{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Remember what his messenger told me.{\r}

169
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,060
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}别害怕{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Don't be afraid.{\r}

170
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,410
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}你原是石女 从未生育 但是你要怀孕生子{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Though you are barren, God will give you a son.{\r}

171
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,190
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}感谢您{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Thank you.{\r}

172
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,820
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}不过仔细听好了  这是有条件的{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}But listen carefully, there are conditions.{\r}

173
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,640
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}你当谨记  清酒浓酒都不可喝{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}See to it that you drink no alcohol{\r}

174
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,530
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}各种不洁的东西也不可以吃。{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}and eat nothing unclean.{\r}

175
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,600
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}儿子出生后  他永远不可剃头{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}And when your son is born, his hair must never be cut.{\r}

176
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,240
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}这是他作为献于天主的人的标记{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}This will be the sign that the boy is a Nazarite.{\r}

177
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,540
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}他自出生起  便归天主{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}He is given to God, from his birth to his death.{\r}

178
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,980
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}他会从培肋舍特人手中解救以色列{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}He will begin to deliver Israel from the Philistines.{\r}

179
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,180
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}你的力量源自天主{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Your strength comes from God.{\r}

180
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:53,110
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}你背负着赶走培肋舍特人的使命{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Your duty is to drive the Philistines away.{\r}

181
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,230
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}三松非但没有对抗培肋舍特人{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Instead of fighting the Philistines,{\r}

182
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,030
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}反而爱上了一个非利士女子  并娶她为妻{\r}
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs9}Samson falls in love and marries one.{\r}

183
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,500
{\fn方正大黑简体\fs14\shad0}-让我和她谈谈  -当然{\r}
