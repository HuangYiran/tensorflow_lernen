这种对恐怖主义赤裸裸的追求

我们为您带来的下一首桑巴是一首怀旧金曲

你是我认识的最聪明 也是最笨的人
You're the smartest and the dumbest fucking person I've ever known.

18

弄错的人可不是我

我们希望你能成为你在参议院以及
专责委员会上所承诺的改革者
The hope is that you are the reformer your record in the Senate would indicate.

29
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,180
那就是说你决定接受改革了?
So, then, you agree that change is in order?

30
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,720
- 是的
- 那是Javadi吗?
Yes, I do. Is that Javadi?

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,260
和我们的妻子在德黑兰的一家法式餐厅里

32
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,590

所以这次行动是你的报复?

- 正是Javadi本人
- Carrie Mathison
Javadi himself. Carrie Mathison.

38
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,340
- 我们现在是不是独处?
- 没有人在监听
Are we completely alone now? No one is listening.

39

我们来谈谈Nasser Hejazi吧
It's time we talk about Nasser Hejazi.

40

你用他的名字从革命卫队那里
侵吞了超过四千五百万美元
Whose name you used to embezzle more than $45 million dollars.

41
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,120
- 你现在是你自己国家的敌人
- 那为什么我还没有被捕?
You are now an enemy of your own state. So why am I not arrested already?

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,450
- Saul想先和你谈谈
- 他会屈服的 对不对?
Saul would like to talk to you first. He will turn, won't he?

43
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,260
让一个情报官员背叛自己的国家
Turning an intelligence officer against his own country.

44
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,940
没有什么工作比这个更微妙且无法捉摸
Well, that's the most delicate and uncertain work there is.

45
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,910
他不肯立刻跟我来 说不想惊动他的人
He wouldn't come with me right away. Said it wouldn't fly with his guys.

46
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,670
太冒险了 所以我和他定了见面时间 
It was too risky. So I set a meet for later.

47
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,500
原计划是直接带他来这里
Plan was to bring him straight here.

48
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,650
需要帮助吗?
Can I help you?

49
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,570
- 住手 不然我开枪了
- 现在我准备好去见Saul了
Stop or I shoot. Now I'm ready to see Saul.

死了两个人 有很多血
这里他妈都血流成河了 Saul
There's two fatalities and a lot of blood. It's a fucking bloodbath, Saul.

51
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,410
尽快把他带离那里 带上凶器
You got to get him out of there as fast as possible. And get the murder weapon.

52
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,120
孩子要怎么办?
What do we do about the baby?

53
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,230
别管他 你们不能留下踪迹
Leave it. You weren't there.

54
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,710
你看起来不像是一个刚刚得到
自己职业生涯中最大资产的人
You don't look like a man who just landed the biggest asset of his career.

55

58
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,820
- 我们要找什么?
- 一把.22口径手枪
So, what are we looking for here? A.22...

59
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,350
还有这只瓶子的上半段
and the top half of this bottle.

60
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,280
梅子酒
Plum wine.

61
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,690
是啊 伊朗产的一种酒
Yeah, some kind of Iranian thing.

62
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,700
我还以为穆斯林不喝酒呢
I thought Muslims didn't drink.

63
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,470
- 多少下?
- 什么?
How many? What? 

64
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,890
他扎了她多少下?
He hit her how many times?

65
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,070
粗略看来至少有十几下
I can see at least a dozen separate strikes.

66
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,330
说实话 用这东西的话...谁数得清啊?
Honestly, though, with this... who the hell knows?

67
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,000
- Cal?
- 我们还在找凶器呢 Cort
Cal? We're still looking for the murder weapons here, Cort.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,680
我有更好的消息 邻居的监控摄像头拍到了这个
I may have something better. Neighbor's security camera picked it up.

69
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,010
每月的第一个周五 德黑兰的阿斯卡利银行
Money is wired from the Al Askari Bank in Tehran

70
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,450
就会把钱汇到卡拉卡斯西班牙拉丁商会的分会
the first Friday of every month to the HLBC subsidiary in Caracas.

71
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,250
这里有你的签名
On your signature there.

72
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,050
我们顺着钱查下去 查到了一系列的恐怖行动
We have traced the funds downstream to a series of terrorist actions,

73
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,070
包括对CIA的攻击
 including the attack on the CIA.

74
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:50,010
但是钱也进了你自己的私人账户
你侵吞了革命卫队差不多五千万美元
But also to your personal accounts where you've diverted nearly $50 million of Revolutionary Guard money.

75
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,640
如果伊斯兰革命卫队发现的话 你死罪难逃
That's punishable by death if the IRGC were to find out.

76
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,690
你想说什么 Saul?
What's your point, Saul?

77
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,740
被个丫头拉下了马?
That I've been brought down by a girl?

78
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,470
被两个丫头?
By two girls?

79
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,790
够了
Enough.

80
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,640
我想他了解自己的处境
I think he appreciates the situation.

81
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,430
- 他很会操纵人 他很擅长
- 我知道
He manipulates people. That's what he does. I know. 

82
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,840
别让他得逞了
You can't let him get to you.

83
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,120
他得逞了
Well, he does.

84
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,370
你是在哪儿找到她的?
Where'd you find that one?

85
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,880
满腔怒火的伊朗难民多着呢
The list of outraged Iranian exiles is long.

86
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,010
她不会干很久的
She won't last.

87
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,810
啊 1976年你就这么说过我
Well, that's what you said about me in 1976.

88
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,450
那时我们才刚开始
When we were both starting out.

89
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,670
所以你抓到我了
So you got me.

90
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,090
你觉得自豪吗?
Are you proud of yourself?

91
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,230
目前是
So far.

92
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,320
我知道你要什么
I know what you want.

93
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,310
是什么?
What's that?

94
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,170
让我把知道的都说出来
To clean me of what I know.

95
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,310
我猜你一定很想知道我国核武器计划的进展 啊?
I imagine the state of our nuclear weapons program is high on your list, huh?

96
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,140
你要和我做交易
There is a deal to be made.

97
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,960
不然我早进监狱了
Or I'd be in prison by now.

98
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,530
如果我开口...
If I talk...

99
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,620
如果我那么做的话
if I do that,

100
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,190
我需要保护
I need protection.

101
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,310
给我在迈阿密找一个安全的房子 要带警卫
I need a secure compound in Miami with a guard detail.

102
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,000
然后把我的钱解冻
And I want my money unfrozen.

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,250
所有的钱
All of it.

104
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,650
就这些?
Is that everything?

105
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,770
目前就这些
For now.

106
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,130
所以你已经想过了?
So you've put some thought into this?

107
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,620
这就是我的条件
Those are my terms.

108
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,810
好
Okay.

109
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,800
那是你的条件
Those are your terms.

110
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,690
但是问题是你弄错了
But the problem is you got it all wrong.

111
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,730
因为我想从你那儿得到的不只是情报
'Cause what I want from you is not just intelligence.

112
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,600
你觉得我为什么要历尽千辛万苦
找出你的金融劣迹?
Why do you think I went through the trouble of documenting your financial misdeeds?

113
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,560
为什么?
Why?

114
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,880
你杀了219个美国人
You killed 219 Americans.

115
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,780
你以为我在乎你侵吞革命卫队的钱啊?
Think I care you also ripped off the Revolutionary Guard?

116
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,430
我早给你定好了计划
I got plans for you.

117
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,080
你透露一两个国家机密就想脱身是不可能的
Much bigger than you spilling a few state secrets.

118
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,670
什么计划?
What plans?

119
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,860
我要把你派回伊朗
I'm gonna play you back into Iran.

120
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,690
从现在起 你为我们工作
From now on, you work for us.

121
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,630
为我
For me.

122
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,730
我是你的新情报官员
I'm your new case officer.

123
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,340
行不通的
It won't work.

124
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,740
- 为什么?
- 你让我暴露了
Why's that? You burned me back home.

125
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,630
- 怎么说?
- 我和你见过面了
- How? - I'm here with you.

126
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,540
- 他们可不知道
- 他们会知道的
- They don't know that. - Oh, they will.

127
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,840
谁会告诉他们啊? 我不会 你不会
Who's going to tell them? Not me, not you.

128
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,420
你自愿来到这里
You came here under your own steam.

129
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,380
不管你是怎么进来的 你的故事还是说得通的
However you managed that, your story's still intact.

130
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,810
如果我拒绝离开呢?
And if I refuse to go?

131
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:37,870
明白了吗?
So we're clear?

132
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,820
要么我送你回伊朗 要么就是另一条路
I'm sending you back to Tehran one way or the other.

133
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,210
不当我的情报员就当革命的叛军吧
Either as my asset or a traitor to the Revolution.

134
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,990
- 他一开始的计划就是这个?
- 嘘
- Was this always the plan? - Shh.

135
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,320
别以为我不会 Majid
Don't think I won't, Majid.

136
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,850
那里可没有法庭 也不会让你一死了之
That's not a trial and quick execution you're facing there.

137
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,580
首先你会受到折磨
You'll be tortured first.

138
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,450
我也知道当众吊死现在又重新流行起来了
And I understand public hangings are back in vogue.

139
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,570
你想知道什么 我都说
I will tell you everything you want to know,

140
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,060
我毫无保留地告诉你 但是我不能回去
chapter and verse, but I can't go back.

141
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,020
- 你两件事都得做
- 不 我不做
You will do both. No, I won't.

142
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,410
- 你必须得这么做 
- 我不做!
- Yes, you will. - No, I won't!

143
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,440
你流血了
You're bleeding.

144
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,340
下午好
Good afternoon.

145
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,850
- 嗯
- 晚上过得很糟?
Yeah. Rough night?

146
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,560
- 也没有
- 你看起来很累
Not especially. You look tired.

147
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,210
想喝点什么吗?
Can I get you anything?

148
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,260
你已经失踪很久了
You've been MIA for days now.

149
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,060
不算是失踪吧
Not really.

150
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,070
我在这里啊
I've been here.

151
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,410
你旷工了 Saul也是
You've been absent. Saul, too.

152
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,160
能不能解释一下?
You care to shed any light on that?

153
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,760
去和Saul谈吧
Talk to Saul.

154
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,260
我说过了 很难找到他的人
Like I said, he's not so easy to find.

155
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,010
你是我的人 Peter
You're my guy, Peter.

156
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,850
是我把你招进来 训练你的
I recruited you. I brought you up.

157
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,530
- 你想说什么?
- 我想说的是我希望从你嘴里
- What's your point? - My point is that entitles me to a certain amount of forthrightness.

158
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,590
听到实话
From you.

159
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,870
Bethesda今早出了一起双重谋杀案
There was a double murder earlier today in Bethesda.

160
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,170
Fariba Javadi 伊朗安全局副局长的前妻
Fariba Javadi, ex-wife of the Iranian Deputy Security Chief.

161
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,680
还有她的儿媳
Also her daughter-in-law.

162
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,250
我知道这是一起该死的屠杀
I understand it was a damn slaughter.

163
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,480
你想要我帮你查查么?
Would you like me to look into it for you?

164
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,530
滚你妈的
Fuck you.

165
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,260
这是在案发现场门外拍到的
That's outside the house where it happened.

166
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,750
下午2点53分 你是主要嫌疑人
2:53 PM. You're the main suspect.

167
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,320
我真他妈希望他们把你钉死在墙上
I hope they nail your ass to the wall.

168
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,450
- Saul在哪里?
- 在审讯室里
- Where's Saul? - In the interrogation room.

169
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,620
你知道我们要把Javadi送回伊朗吗?
Did you know we're sending Javadi back to Iran?

170
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,280
你错过好戏了
You missed the fireworks.

171
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,060
Javadi听到自己要回去以后魂都吓没了
我们得等到他把血止住
Javadi blew when he found out he had to go back. We're on hold till they stop the bleeding.

172
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,160
- 最好不要等太久
- 该死
We better not wait too long. Shit.

173
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,540
我刚要重新开始 怎么了?
I'm about to start again. What's the deal?

174
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,410
小区里的监控录像拍到我了
警方放出了全境通缉
Neighbor's security camera picked me up. There's an APB out.

175
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,270
- 只是你?
- 是的 不知道为什么没拍到Javadi和Carrie
Just you? Yeah, somehow it missed Javadi and Carrie.

176
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,860
- 从哪儿弄到的?
- Dar Adal 记录是他监视着的
Where'd you get this? Dar Adal. He monitors the blotters.

177
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,920
- 所以他知道Javadi入境了?
- 他知道出事了 但是不知道实情
So he knows Javadi's in the country? He knows something's up; he's not in on it.

178
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,440
我建议你赶快去找他谈谈
I suggest you go talk to him soon.

179
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,690
- 我会的
- 我是说马上
- I will. - I mean now.

180
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,120
- 他很火大
- 我会把事情压下去 与此同时
He's furious. I'll smooth things over. In the meantime,

181
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,850
你躲在这里不要出去 我们不能让你被捕
you need to stay out of sight here in this building. We can't risk having you arrested.

182
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,530
- 好吧 但是我们要怎么做?
- Bethesda警局有个队长欠我一个人情
Fine, but what do we do about this? There's a police captain in Bethesda who owes me.

183
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,060
我可以打电话给他 至少让他撤下照片
I could call him, at least get the photo down off the wire.

184
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,100
去吧 去和他面谈 用你国家安全局的身份
Do it, face-to-face. Play the national security card.

185
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,520
告诉他我在背后全力支持你
Tell him you have my full support.

186
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,030
万一他要谋杀的细节怎么办?
What if he wants details about the murder?

187
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,150
不能告诉他
He can't have them.

188
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,900
如果任何人猜到Javadi在境内 我们就完了
If anyone even suspects Javadi's in the country, we're through.

189
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,360
去啊
Well?

190
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,990
我查了整幢房子的监控 我一定是忘了邻居家的
I checked the whole house for surveillance. I must have missed the neighbors.

191
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,450
- 是啊 我他妈整件事情都搞砸了
- 进行得怎样了?
Yeah, well, I missed the whole fucking thing. How's it going in there?

192
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,340
很慢
Slowly.

193
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,160
- 有困难?
- 哦 我们会有办法的
Trouble? Oh, we'll manage.

194
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,760
你看起来很不高兴
You seem upset.

195
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,700
这样就好了
That's good enough.

196
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,470
- 嗯?
- 嗯什么?
Well? Well what?

197
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,880
你有没有接受目前的状况?
Have you come to terms with your situation?

198
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,950
怎么进行?
How does it work?

199
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,270
我们尽快把你送回你的国家
We return you to your people as soon as possible.

200
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,610
我假设他们已经给你找好了离开本国的路径
I assume they've arranged a way for you to get out of the country.

201
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,580
不 我是说Fariba
No, I meant about Fariba.

202
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,440
这宗罪行必须得掩饰过去
A crime is committed that must be covered up.

203
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,330
这里的程序是什么?
How does it work here?

204
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,020
你杀了她
You killed her.

205
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,390
为什么?
Why?

206
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,560
尽你所能来回击我?
Get back at me because you could?

207
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,270
她是我的妻子 她对我不忠
She was my wife. She was unfaithful.

208
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,910
她是你的前妻 都是35年前的事了
She was your ex-wife. It was 35 years ago.

209
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,780
在神看来 我们还是夫妻
In the eyes of God, we're still married.

210
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,950
我应该用石头砸死她
I should have stoned her to death,

211
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,640
但是你给我的时间不够
but you didn't give me enough time.

212
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,180
还记得这个吗?
Remember this?

213
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,530
是Fariba的21岁生日
It was Fariba's 21st birthday.

214
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,830
我们谈了一整晚 我们四个人
We talked all night, the four of us,

215
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,780
谈论未来会带给我们什么
about what the future might bring.

216
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,650
不该是这样的
It wasn't this.

217
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,590
Carrie?
Carrie?

218
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:39,900
- 不是说到外面去谈么
- 我的人有几个问题
I thought we were meeting outside. My guys have a few questions.

219
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,510
你告诉他们我不能说 对吧?
You told them I can't talk about it, right?

220
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,240
是的 我和他们说了
Yeah, I told them.

221
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,310
Johnson警探
Detectives Johnson,

222
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,890
Cort警探 Carrie Mathison
Cort, Carrie Mathison.

223
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,330
好吧 我知道这样你们不高兴
Okay, I understand you're not happy about this.

224
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,130
- 哦 你高兴么?
- 当然不高兴了
Oh, and you are? Of course not.

225
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,440
我们和你们一样不满
We're as upset as you.

226
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,340
- 这人是谁啊?
- 我恐怕不能说
So who's this guy? I'm afraid that's classified.

227
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,120
- 但是他是你们的人?
- 嗯 这点也不能说
But he's one of yours? Well, that's classified, too.

228
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,920
- 你能告诉我他在这里干什么吗?
- 我不能...
Can you tell me what he was doing here? That's...

229
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,040
你能告诉我他怎么认识受害人的吗?
Can you tell me how he knew the victims?

230
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,270
- 好吧 等下
- 你他妈能告诉我什么啊?
- Okay, wait a second. - Can you tell me any goddamn thing at all?

231
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,920
你能告诉我为什么这位女士会躺在这里
喉咙被人割烂了?
Can you tell me why this lady's laying here with her throat cut to ribbons?

232
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,110
你到底能他妈说什么?
Any fucking thing?

233
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,540
失陪
Excuse me.

234
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,440
好吧 队长?
Okay, Cap?

235
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,830
你不是个狂热分子 你很现实
You're not a fanatic. You're a pragmatist.

236
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,450
一直都是
Always have been.

237
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,030
我是谁不是谁轮不到你来说
Don't tell me what I am and what I am not.

238
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,180
我们都老了 这点没什么可争的吧
Well, we're both old men. There's no disputing that.

239
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,480
的确
We are.

240
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:09,560
年纪大的诅咒就是你会意识到
最终我们什么也控制不了
It's the curse of old men to realize that in the end, we control nothing.

241
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,880
所以我们要爆发
So we lash out.

242
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,150
布宜诺斯艾利斯 柏林
Buenos Aires, Berlin...

243
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,690
卑尔根(挪威城市)
Bergen.

244
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,080
这些都是小打小闹 Majid
These are small acts, Majid.

245
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,310
跟你配不上
Unworthy of you.

246
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,160
你漏了一点
You left something out.

247
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,580
CIA爆炸案
The bombing of the CIA.

248
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,040
这可不小
Nothing small about that.

249
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,100
- 这可就配得上了
- 我本来也想和你谈谈那事的
Nothing unworthy. Well, I wanted to talk about that, too.

250
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,410
- 你当然想了
- 因为当爆炸发生以后
I'm sure you do. Because when that bomb went off,

251
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,760
死了那么多的人
killing all those people,

252
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,870
很多是我的朋友
many of them my friends,

253
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:56,790
我的第一个念头
my first thought

254
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,390
不是复仇
was not revenge.

255
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,780
而是...
It was...

256
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,140
"我们得做出改变"
"Something has to change. "

257
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,910
以牙还牙 以眼还眼
You hit us, we hit you.

258
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,040
总是一成不变
It's always the same.

259
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,280
那么...
And...

260
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,760
我作为你的间谍回国会改变这一切吗?
how does my going back as your spy change any of that?

261
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,880
常年以来 我们在后台辛勤劳作 你和我
For years, we toiled in back rooms, you and I.

262
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,640
我们辛勤劳作
We toiled

263
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,530
让肤浅之辈在舞台上亮相
while shallower men held the stage,

264
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,760
等待我们上台的那一刻
waiting for our time to come,

265
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,560
渐渐意识到那一刻永远不会来
gradually understanding it never would.

266
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,040
突然 这一刻来了
Now it has, unexpectedly.

267
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,030
对你来说 是来了
For you, it has.

268
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,780
你是那个让一切变成可能的人
You're the one who made it possible.

269
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,970
我想要还情
I want to return the favor.

270
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,980
你觉得这像是在还情吗 Saul?
Does this look like a favor to you, Saul?

271
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,690
Majid 多亏了你 我得以站在舞台的正中央
Majid, thanks to you, I stand at the center of things.

272
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,710
我的权力是你赐予的
You put me in power.

273
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,980
你回德黑兰去 我也会为你做同样的事
You go back to Tehran, I'll do the same for you.

274
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,520
我知道一个方法
I know a way.

275
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,850
你没事吧?
You all right?

276
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,580
是的 抱歉 我不知道发生了什么事
Yeah, sorry. I don't know what happened there.

277
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,940
- 所以我们说定了?
- 我可不觉得 不行 
So are we okay? I wouldn't say so, no.

278
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,890
抱歉 你不能把这事处理掉吗?
I'm sorry, but can't you handle that?

279
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,170
你是说 我不能以长官身份把这事压下去吗?
You mean, can't I just pull rank and shut this thing down?

280
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:32,570
当然了 你现在不也正在压我呢吗
但是你知道接下来会怎样吗?
Sure, just like you try with me. But you know what happens next?

281
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,250
那张照片和这房间里的所有证据都会
Somehow that photo and all the evidence in this room

282
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,540
莫名其妙出现在德拉吉报道
甚至该死的维基泄密上面
show up on Drudge Report or goddamn Wikileaks,

283
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,560
到那时你才真是遇上麻烦了
and then you've got yourself a real problem.

284
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,220
别用那种我一点忙也帮不上的眼神看我
And don't look at me like I'm being less than helpful.

285
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,620
我只是告诉你事实而已
I'm just talking reality here.

286
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,720
那你说怎么办?
So what do you suggest?

287
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,840
他们想要和照片里的人谈谈
They want to talk to the guy in the photo.

288
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,480
- 那不可能
- 你想不想悄无声息地解决这事啊?
- That's impossible. - You want this thing closed quietly?

289
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,570
那就想个办法
Find a way.

290
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,050
- Quinn哪儿去了?
- 呃 外面吧 大概
Where's Quinn? Uh, outside, I think.

291
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,270
- 能找到他吗?
- 是不是计划从一开始就是把他送回伊朗?
Could you find him? Was it always the plan to send Javadi back to Iran?

292
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,940
- 希望是如此
- 没人告诉我
It was always the hope. No one told me.

293
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,490
嗯 自豪点吧 这都是你达成的
Well, you should be proud. Your work made it all possible.

294
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:23,630
我才不自豪 他对这个国家做的事情
比起他对伊朗做的事来简直是九牛一毛
I'm not proud. What he did to this country, it's nothing compared to what he did to Iran.

295
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,110
- 我们应该让他上法庭
- 计划不是那样的
- We should try him for what he's done. - That's not the plan.

296
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,730
计划不是这样的 请帮我找到Quinn
That's not the plan. Go find Quinn, please.

297
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,670
- 他同意了 
- 很好
- He's in. - Good.

298
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,910
- 你那边处理得怎样了?
- 不太好
How'd you make out? Not so well.

299
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,070
当地警察想找你谈谈
They want to talk to you- the local cops do.

300
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,410
- 你告诉他们不可能 对吧?
- 说过好几遍
- You told them that was impossible, right? - Several times.

301
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,040
我还以为你的队长朋友会把这事处理掉
I thought your captain friend was gonna take care of this.

302
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,480
是啊 我本来也希望的 被他耍了
Yeah, me, too. He boned me.

303
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,170
最重要的是不能危害到Javadi计划
The important thing here is to not jeopardize the Javadi play.

304
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,670
对吧? 那我去和当地警察谈谈
Agreed? So let me talk to them, the cops.

305
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,880
- 你要怎么说?
- 我不知道 看他们问什么吧
And say what? I don't know, see what they ask.

306
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,240
你知道他们会怎么问
You know what they'll ask.

307
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,300
你是他们唯一的嫌疑人
既然你不能告诉他们事实是什么
You're their only suspect,
and since you can't tell them what actually happened,

308
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,100
你就得承认自己杀了两个人
还不准他们逮捕你
you'll be admitting to two murders
and then saying they can't touch you for it.

309
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,130
好吧
Okay.

310
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,850
听着 警方可能会危及到我们的行动
Look, we have police threatening to blow up our operation.

311
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,870
我们至少也得要争取时间把Javadi弄出国去
At the very least, this buys us enough time to get Javadi out of the country.

312
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,150
除非你还有其他选择 先这么做吧
So unless you got another option? Do it.

313
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,610
- 至少让我和他一起去
- 不 Javadi来这里是和你联系
At least let me go with him. No. Javadi came here to contact you.

314
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,950
只有你才能和他在公众场合出现
我需要你送他回他自己人那里去
You're the only one who can be seen with him. I need you to get him back to his people.

315
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,500
- 什么时候?
- 越快越好
- When? - Soon as possible.

316
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,840
你得在发生其他爆炸案之前把他弄出国去
You got to get him out of the country before anything else blows up,

317
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,230
我要你一直呆在他身边
我们不能再搞砸了 懂吗?
and you need to stay right by his side. We cannot risk another screwup, okay?

318
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,290
- 你要去哪里?
- 我要去见Lockhart议员 他已经注意到
- Where will you be? - I got a meeting with Senator Lockhart, who's apparently noticed

319
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,180
我这周都没在办公室露过脸了
I haven't been at my office all week.

320
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,400
我们得把这事保密到Javadi坐上
回伊朗的飞机去为止
We need to keep this thing together until Javadi's on a plane heading back to Iran.

321
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,490
时间到了 Carrie会送你回去
It's time. Carrie will take you back.

322
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,070
你怎么知道我不会就此消失?
And what makes you sure I won't just vanish?

323
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,280
这边
This way.

324
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,510
她会一直把你送上飞机
She'll be with you all the way to the plane.

325
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,860
我是说在伊朗
I meant in Iran.

326
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,460
我以前说过 这一切都是你开头的
What I said before. You started this.

327
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,520
我觉得你会很想看结局如何的
I think you'll want to be there when it ends.

328
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,360
在你走之前我得弄清楚一件事
I need to know something before you leave.

329
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,450
我需要知道
I need to know.

330
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,370
是谁放的炸弹
Who was responsible for the bomb?

331
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,090
- 兰利的那个?
- 是
The bomb at Langley? Yes.

332
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,780
那天在地上的炸弹 是谁放的
On the ground that day. Who was responsible?

333
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,490
我觉得是Brody 你是这么告诉参议院的
I thought it was Brody. That's what you told the Senate.

334
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,200
也是这么告诉全世界的
That's what you told the entire world.

335
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,960
全世界都在追捕他 还有一千万的悬赏金
You have a manhunt on five continents, a $10 million reward...

336
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,910
是他做的吗 是或不是
Did he do it? Yes or no.

337
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,590
- 我不知道
- 我不相信你
I don't know. I don't believe you.

338
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,690
- 我不...
- 看着我的眼睛 回答我
- I don't... - Look me in the eye and answer.

339
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,990
不是他
It wasn't him.

340
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,330
是Abu Nazir的人干的
It was one of Abu Nazir's guys.

341
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,670
具体是谁放的
Who, exactly...

342
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,740
我当时并不想知道
I didn't want to know.

343
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,010
我们会给你一些衣服让你换上
We'll get you some clothes to change into.

344
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,150
然后Carrie会带你回到你的飞机上
Then Carrie will take you back to your plane.

345
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,070
- 可以等一下我吗
- 好的 先生
Will you give me a sec? Yes, sir.

346
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,710
Saul? 你在哪儿
Saul? Where are you?

347
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,610
- 我在开车
- 回家吗
Driving. Home?

348
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,520
不 回去工作
No. Back to work.

349
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,500
我一直在想我们在德黑兰的那段日子
I've been thinking about our days in Tehran.

350
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,520
是吗
Really?

351
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,170
那是很久以前了
That was... a long time ago.

352
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,630
是啊 我们当时那么年轻
Yep. We were so young.

353
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,960
当一切都毁了以后我是那么的担心你
I was so worried about you when it all went to hell.

354
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,120
想着怎么救你出来
About getting you out.

355
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,070
不 我也很担心你
Yeah, no, I was... worried about you.

356
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,420
因为我抛下你自己跑了
Leaving you behind.

357
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,700
我说过我不在意你在孟买的那些朋友
其实我在意
I said I didn't care about your friend from Mumbai, but I do.

358
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,370
我当时还说自己并没有你的所有权
I said I didn't have any claim on you.

359
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,590
- Saul
- 但是我有
Saul... But I do.

360
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,230
也许这些只是我的一己之见吧
Maybe it's just in my own mind at this point.

361
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:22,510
我也不知道 但我必须在一切都太迟了之前告诉你
I don't know. But I needed to tell you before it's too late.

362
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,950
- 你在听吗
- 在
Did you hear me? Yes.

363
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,590
这是我在两天里第一次出来呼吸到新鲜的空气
It's the first time I could come up for air in nearly two days.

364
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,950
我想让你知道
I wanted you to know.

365
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,460
你什么时候回来
When are you coming home?

366
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,660
跟平常一样
Usual.

367
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:43,160
- 不会很晚的
- 好吧
Not till late. Okay.

368
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,500
那我们到时候见
Well, I'll see you then.

369
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,940
跟着这些标记 然后...
Just follow the tags, and...

370
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,230
在里面
In there.

371
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,770
- 这是什么
- 我们和你的联系方式
What's this? How we'll contact you.

372
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,270
把它记下来 还有用来掩饰的故事
Memorize it. Also your cover story.

373
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,150
以及你从我这儿得到的情报
让你来这里显得更有说服力
The information you pried out of me that justifies your coming here.

374
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,500
这样我们才能毁了你们整个组织
It's how we took down your network.

375
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,610
- 这是真的情报?
- 都是可核实的
Is it true? It's verifiable.

376
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,090
情报的来源是谁
Who is the source?

377
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,660
如果我要去伊朗 我就得把内奸揪出来
If I go to Iran, I'll have to take the traitor out.

378
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,170
- 你知道的
- 源头就是我们的一次黑客入侵
You know that. The source is a hack we did,

379
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,390
一种可以让我们监听你们通讯的电脑病毒
a computer virus that allowed us to monitor your communications.

380
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:49,350
如果你想带走它 就带走吧 我们有你就够了
You want to take it out, go ahead. We have you now.

381
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,590
是时候回到你的人民身边了 准备好没
It's time to go back to your people. You ready?

382
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,130
好了
Yeah.

383
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,040
你打算怎么做 把我完全排除在情况之外吗
What were you planning to do, bypass me entirely?

384
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,460
我不会道歉的 这事只能有小部分人知道
I'm not going to apologize. I had to keep the circle small.

385
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,610
范围也太小了 你 Carrie Quinn
Not that small. You, Carrie, Quinn.

386
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,850
现在想想看 我也很久没看见那个头巾女了
And come to think of it, I haven't seen that headscarf for a while.

387
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,310
- 知道这些就够了
- 我还以为我们彼此信任
All need-to-know. I thought we trusted each other.

388
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,160
就你一个
Just you.

389
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,090
- 我只能再让你一个人知道
- 我不认为这可行
I tell just you. I don't see how.

390
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,600
Lockhart正在你的办公室等着你
You've got Lockhart waiting in your office.

391
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,750
你觉得他不会发现伊斯兰革命卫队头目的前妻
在Bethesda被杀了吗
You think he didn't notice that the ex-wife of the IRGC Chief got slaughtered in Bethesda?

392
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,940
或者是被你送进精神病院的Carrie
Or that Carrie, whom you committed to a psych ward,

393
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,010
已经出来了而你也不管吗
got out and you're doing shit about it?

394
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,840
他是参议院情报委员会的老大
不是让你逗着玩的猴子
He's the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, not some civilian fuck-monkey.

395
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,260
知道了
Okay.

396
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,300
我是在暗中操作一些事 一项行动
I do have something going. An operation...

397
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,980
得了吧 直接告诉我细节
And we're past that. It's time for details.

398
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,440
好吧
Fine.

399
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,920
我直接一起告诉你们两个人
I'll tell you both.

400
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,940
你从没告诉我那是谁的主意
You never told me whose idea it was.

401
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,160
把你当鱼饵丢出去
To hang you out as bait.

402
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,150
是你的主意还是Saul的?
Was it your idea or Saul's?

403
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,980
好吧
That's all right.

404
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,850
你不说我也知道 那是Saul的主意
You don't have to say. It was Saul's idea.

405
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:51,120
肯定是 事实上这是Saul的典型做法
It had to be. In fact, it's classic Saul.

406
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,250
- 如果是典型的 那你怎么上钩了
- 你觉得呢
If it's so classic, why'd you fall for it? Why do you think?

407
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,790
是因为你
It was you.

408
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,050
你所承受的虐待
The abuse you went through.

409
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,720
Saul为了引我过来而对你做的一切
What Saul did to you to get me here.

410
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,530
连我都没有干过这么残忍的事
Even I have never done anything so cruel.

411
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,670
你总是忘了 我见过你的杰作的
You're forgetting I've seen your handiwork.

412
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:18,080
- 你没办法糊弄我
- 我没有糊弄你
You can't bullshit me. I'm not bullshitting you.

413
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,530
那么你一定是在臆想了
Then you're seriously deluded.

414
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,340
- 你知道他问了我什么吗
- 你为什么杀了你妻子吗
You know what he asked me? Why you killed your wife?

415
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,560
谁动了那颗炸弹 如果真的是Brody
Who moved the bomb. If it was Brody.

416
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,300
他为什么会这么问我
Now, why would he ask me that?

417
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:34,940
这说明关于那件事情是有分歧的
That implies that there's a difference of opinion on that subject.

418
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,790
是吧?
Right?

419
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,420
你怎么回答他的
What'd you tell him?

420
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,670
告诉他是Abu Nazir的人干的
That it was one of Abu Nazir's guys.

421
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,690
不是Brody?
Not Brody?

422
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,490
不是
No.

423
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,160
谁
Who?

424
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,880
其他人
Someone else.

425
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,590
我仅仅知道这些了
That's all I know.

426
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,280
你是Peter Quinn?
You Peter Quinn?

427
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,350
呃...是的
Uh, yeah.

428
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,600
怎么了 这个问题很难回答吗
What? That's a difficult question?

429
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,040
- 没有
- 因为你的同伴Mathison一直坚持你叫Candor
No. 'Cause your compadre Mathison, she promised what she called "Candor. "

430
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,410
Peter Quinn是...
Peter Quinn is, uh...

431
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,430
- 什么
- 我的真名
What? My legal name.

432
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,080
受害人中的一个是伊朗人
Uh, one of the victims, she was Iranian.

433
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,040
是的
Yes.

434
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,540
是一名伊斯兰革命卫队成员的前妻吗
Ex-wife of an Iranian security guy... IRGC?

435
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,550
- 是的
- 而另一个受害人是她的儿媳?
Yes. And the other victim, that's his daughter-in-law?

436
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,700
- 是的
- 我想这件事一定很重要
Yes. I assume that's significant.

437
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,610
是的
Right.

438
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,300
你的回答够简洁的
These are some terse responses.

439
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,550
- 我们能直接走程序了吗
- 走程序?
Look, can we just get on with this? "On with this"?

440
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:12,540
我们就是在走程序 我们怎么不是在走程序
We are "On with it. " How are we not "On with it"?

441
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,870
- 我的同事说你们接受认罪了
- 并不是这样
My colleague led me to believe you were after a confession. Well, that's incorrect.

442
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,750
我刚才说这些是为了搞清楚这儿发生了什么
What I said was, I'm trying to understand what happened here.

443
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,940
- 那是不可能的
- 她也是这么说的
That's not gonna be possible. Yeah, that's what she said.

444
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,490
她说我只需要知道这件事关系到国家安全
She said all I need to know is that it's national security.

445
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,120
就这些 就这些
This is. This.

446
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,190
听着 你或许觉得我就是个混球
能在这儿教训你
Look, I know you think I'm just some dick jacking you up because I can,

447
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,260
只是因为你运气不好被拍到了
'cause you were unlucky enough to get yourself photographed.

448
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:41,150
也许就是这样 我也不知道
但事实上...
And maybe that's true, I don't know. But actually,

449
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:46,010
我只是在尽量搞清楚你们这些人所干的好事
I'm just trying to understand this shit that you people do.

450
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:49,880
这堆我们得齐心协力搞定的麻烦事
因为我们缴税了
This shit that we're a party to 'cause we pay taxes.

451
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,470
这些...
This...

452
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,850
他妈的这堆烂摊子
This shit.

453
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,560
所以 是你杀了她的儿媳?
So you killed the daughter?

454
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,630
- 是的
- 用什么杀的
Yes. With?

455
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,070
瓦尔特P22
A Walther P22.

456
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,860
她呢? 同一件武器吗
What about the mother? Same weapon?

457
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,990
不
No.

458
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,530
用的玻璃瓶
That was with a bottle.

459
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,890
青梅酒瓶
Plum wine.

460
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,490
为了国家安全
For national security.

461
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,460
你们这些混蛋
You fucking people.

462
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,640
你有没有做过什么把情况变得更糟的事
Have you ever done anything... but make things worse?

463
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,930
这是个很特殊的消息
This is special access information.

464
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:59,960
好的
Fine.

465
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,170
- 不能告诉任何人
- 明白
It can't leave this room. Understood.

466
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,510
说吧
So?

467
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,440
我招募了一名伊朗的高级官员
I've recruited a high-level Iranian asset.

468
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,000
伊斯兰革命卫队的副职 Majid Javadi
IRGC Deputy Chief Majid Javadi.

469
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,910
Javadi?
Javadi?

470
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:22,730
是的
Yes.

471
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,480
- 那个资助炸掉CIA的炸弹的人
- 没错
The man who financed the bombing of the CIA.
That's right.

472
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,780
你为什么要去相信他
Why on Earth would you trust him?

473
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,510
我们得到了一些可以让他危及他的政府的情报
We've developed information that would compromise him with his own government;

474
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:38,260
- 一堆关于他腐败的情报
- 在伊朗 腐败是无比正常的事
evidence of wholesale corruption. Which, in Iran, just means it's Tuesday.

475
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,760
通常我是同意的
Normally I'd agree.

476
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:44,300
但是这几千万美金原本是伊斯兰革命卫队用来
But this is tens of millions of dollars siphoned

477
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,850
策划恐怖袭击的秘密资金
from a secret IRGC fund designated for terrorist activities.

478
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,760
- 没人会觉得这是平常事的
- 所以你要挟了他
No one would look the other way. So you blackmailed him.

479
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,580
是的
That's right.

480
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,850
- 那你为什么没有告诉委员会
- 我在等时机成熟
Is there some reason you didn't tell my Committee? I was waiting for it to be real.

481
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,660
时机不成熟是因为正是这些情报人员
It wasn't because this is just the kind of human intelligence nonsense

482
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:09,070
导致了四个月前在这栋楼里发生的灾难?
that led to disaster right here in this building not four months ago?

483
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:13,210
相信我们的宿敌会神奇地让我们转变立场
Believing our sworn enemies will magically switch sides.

484
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,800
我们讨论过这事
We talked about this,

485
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,720
放弃你所谓的冷战什么的必要性
the need to wean you of your cold war bullshit.

486
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,760
- 我们同意这个问题持保留意见的
- 我不这么觉得
We agreed to disagree. I don't see it that way,

487
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,690
特别是十天后是我来收拾你的烂摊子
not when I'm inheriting your mess in ten days.

488
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,640
烂摊子
A mess.

489
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,520
这就是你对安插一个高级资产到
That's what you call placing a major asset inside a government

490
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,570
已经暗箱操作30年的政府的评价?
that's been a black box for 30 years?

491
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,430
你问我一直在做些什么
You asked me what I've been doing.

492
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,510
我告诉你了
I told you.

493
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,790
可以结束了吗
Are we done?

494
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,310
不会很久了
Not by a long shot.

495
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,750
我要知道详细的过程
I want to know how this happened.

496
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,330
快到了
Almost there.

497
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,260
快到了 你却还没有问
Almost there and you still haven't asked.

498
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,470
- 问什么
- 谁动的那个炸弹
What? Who moved the bomb.

499
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,370
你告诉Saul了 是Abu Nazir的人
You told Saul it was one of Abu Nazir's guys.

500
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,590
- 我是这么说的
- 我也已经知道了
Yes, I did. Which I already knew.

501
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,520
但是是谁给他钥匙的?
And who handed him the keys?

502
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,690
别告诉我你从来没想过这事
Don't tell me you never wondered.

503
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,850
我打赌你一直在想这个问题
I bet you wonder all the time.

504
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,340
Brody从炸弹中逃生了
Brody escaped the blast.

505
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,150
他知道会有爆炸吗
Did he know it was coming?

506
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,280
或许我已经知道这个问题的答案了
Maybe I already know the answer to that.

507
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,550
也许你并不知道
Maybe you don't.

508
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:58,220
好吧 我想你是不想知道真相
Fine. I guess you don't want the truth.

509
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,650
我想 只是我不想从你这儿知道
I do. I just don't think I'd get it from you.

510
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,310
好吧
Okay.

511
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,730
- 我想知道关于他的妻子的事
- 她怎么了
I want to know about the wife. What about her?

512
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,350
你招募了Javadi
然后他的老婆和儿媳妇就突然死了
You recruit Javadi, his wife's suddenly dead along with the daughter-in-law.

513
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,460
- 别告诉我那是巧合
- 那不是
Don't tell me that's a coincidence. It's not.

514
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,700
那么是谁干的
So who did it?

515
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,610
每次你在回答问题时的长时间沉默
You know, every time you answer a question with a big, gaping nothing,

516
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:34,450
都会让我想起我们之间是怎么一个问题
it reminds me what a problem we have, you and I.

517
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,670
Javadi干的
It was Javadi.

518
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,530
等等 你是说他就在国内?
Wait a second. You're saying he was in this country?

519
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,680
- 是的
- 而你知道他在
That's right. And you knew this?

520
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,790
我们引诱他来的 Carrie引诱他来的
We lured him here.
Carrie did.

521
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,720
等等
So, wait.

522
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,820
你们俩...
You two...

523
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,050
你俩在合作
You were working together.

524
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,990
即使你在委员会面前谴责她
Even when you were denouncing her in front of my Committee.

525
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,380
都是在演戏
All for show.

526
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,510
你知道吗
Did you know?

527
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,110
- 我现在才知道
- 那还有谁知道
I'm learning it now with you. Well, who did know?

528
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,710
该知道这事的人
Everyone who needed to.

529
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,860
不 是不应该知道这事的人
因为现在就有两个本不应该知道这事的人
No, everyone who needed to didn't know, because two of those people are in this room right now

530
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:28,010
对你很恼火 让Carrie过来 现在
holding their dicks. I want Carrie brought in... now.

531
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,120
- 她没法过来
- 为什么
She can't come here now. And why is that?

532
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,910
- 她很忙 她忙着把Javadi送上回伊朗的飞机
- 他还在这儿?
She's busy. She's putting Javadi on a plane back to Iran. He's still here?

533
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,730
禁飞那架飞机
Ground the fucking plane.

534
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,030
- 不行
- 禁飞那架飞机
- No. - Ground it.

535
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:43,810
我还要继续担任代理局长两个星期 你做不了主
I'm Acting Director for another two weeks. It's not your call.

536
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:47,610
- 我会告诉总统的 我发誓
- 然后呢
I'll bump this up to the President, I swear to God. Then what?

537
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,500
我们把Javadi曝个精光
We fry Javadi's ass publicly.

538
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,340
- 这是目光短浅的行为
- 这是为了正义
Well, that's shortsighted. It's justice.

539
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,990
这没有用 因为在德黑兰
It's ineffective... 'cause back in Tehran,

540
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:59,160
会有和他一样的人来代替他
一个我们不能控制的人
he's replaced by someone just like him who we can't control.

541
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,230
上次在这儿发生的袭击会一次又一次地重演
And the attack that happened here happens again and again and again.

542
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:07,660
这是一个一劳永逸的行动 它会改变一切
This is a once-in-a-lifetime operation that can transform everything.

543
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:11,730
- 整个中东
- 你听起来很兴奋啊
The entire Middle East. You sound like you're fucking high.

544
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,630
我会给总统打电话的
I'm calling the President.

545
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,050
你听见我说了什么了吗
Did you hear what I said?

546
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,610
我会打给他的 把电话给我
I'm calling him. Get me a goddamn phone.

547
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,650
好吧
Fine.

548
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,200
这儿
Here.

549
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:35,410
- 毁掉我们所做的一切努力
- 我甚至不愿意去回应那件事
Destroy everything we've been working for. I'm not even going to dignify that with a response.

550
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,460
- 你是真的什么都不明白 是吧
- 你知道吗
- You really don't get it, do you? - You know what?

551
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,180
我第一次觉得我明白了
For the first time, I think I really do.

552
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:44,360
我明白为什么数十年来这儿工作
都像在搞小丑表演 这个怎么用?
I see now why this place has been a fucking clown act for decades. How does this work?

553
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,670
我不知道
I'm not sure.

554
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,150
不用担心 我会搞定总统的
And don't worry. I'll handle the President.

555
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,150
开门
Open the door.

556
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,920
- 不行
- 快他妈的开门
No.
Open the goddamned door.

557
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,000
命令我啊
Make me.

558
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,070
Dar 快开门
Dar, let me out of here.

559
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,260
Dar?
Dar?

560
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,300
Dar
Dar.

561
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,030
你们死定了 你们两个...
You're dead. Both of you son...

562
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,550
这他妈的干嘛
What the fuck?

563
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,840
你有过机会的
Well, you had your chance.

564
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,900
等等
Wait!

565
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:08,020
没事的
It's okay.

566
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,320
- 你说过你会告诉我真相
- 你也说过我不会告诉你的
You said you'd tell me the truth. And you told me I was incapable.

567
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,970
你或许是对的
You might be right.

568
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,820
但是如果你想和你相信的人聊聊的话
But if you want to talk to someone you can trust...

569
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,630
那个人在那里 你应该知道那个人
who was there, you should know that the man

570
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,060
那个制造了炸弹而且移动了SUV的人
who built the bomb and moved the SUV...

571
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,230
并没有像他们所说的死于爆炸
he didn't die in the explosion like they say.

572
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,670
据我所知 他还在国内
As far as I know, he's still in this country.

573
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,400
- 在哪儿
- 我不知道
Where? I don't know.

574
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,610
- 谁知道
- 一个你见过的人
Who does? Someone you've already met.

575
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:52,760
是他让我们聚在了一起
The man that brought us together.

576
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,950
你的律师? Bennett?
Your lawyer? Bennett?

577
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,120
不 相信我 事情搞成这样了
No. The way this worked out, believe me,

578
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,880
他不会再是我的律师了
he's not my lawyer anymore.

579
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:32,160
是您下令让雷达360度扫描的吗
You requested radar following on Three Six Oscar?

580
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,150
是的
Yes.

581
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,840
雷达已经于22点19分扫描完了美国领空
That aircraft cleared US airspace at 2219 hours.

582
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,520
- 谢谢
- 好的 长官
Thank you. Yes, sir.

583
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:45,430
大胆的行动
An audacious operation.

584
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,400
才刚刚开始
Just the beginning.

585
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,140
为接下来的成功干杯
Here's to continued success.

586
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,700
你得知道
You know, I do need to apologize...

587
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,100
我应当为把事情瞒着你而道歉
for excluding you.

588
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,240
你不需要为自己解释 Saul
You don't have to explain yourself, Saul.

589
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,540
你是中央情报局的代理局长
You are the goddamn Acting Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

590
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,170
还得再当10天呢
For ten more days.

591
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,160
Lockhart参议员不小心把他自己锁在会议室里了
Senator Lockhart managed to get himself stuck in the conference room.

592
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,270
你能让管理处把他弄出来吗
Could you ask facilities to let him out?

593
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:58,130
- 情况如何了
- 他们让步了
How'd it go? They're standing down.

594
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,390
还挺顺利
So it went well.

595
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,770
他们说什么来着 坦白对于灵魂有好处
What do they say, confession is good for the soul?

596
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,120
只是你根本没做错什么
Only you didn't do it.

597
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,100
我知道
I know.

598
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,860
但我的确感觉好了些
But it made me feel better.

599
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,540
我想 是正确的人 错误的罪行吧
Wrong crime, right guy, I guess.

600
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,670
你知道我还想清楚什么了吗
You know what else I realized?

601
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:20,350
我和CIA之间的关系
Just how through I am with...

602
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,750
彻彻底底地...
this, the CIA.

603
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:31,060
我什么也不会相信了
I just do not believe anymore.

604
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,750
相信什么
Believe what?

605
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:37,730
那些使我们造成的伤害变得理所应当的借口
That anything justifies the damage we do.

606
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,820
你还不能退出
You can't quit yet.

607
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,650
Javadi正飞越大西洋回家
Javadi's out over the Atlantic heading home.

608
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:50,420
在他离开之前...他告诉我了一些事
关于兰利的炸弹的事
And he told me something before he left... about the Langley bomber.

609
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,240
- 你是说Brody
- 不是他 这才是问题
You mean Brody. No, that's just it.

610
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,840
不是他干的 而我现在就能证明
It's not him, and I can prove it now.

611
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,710
但是...
But...

612
00:44:58,610 --> 00:44:59,830
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

613
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:05,670
Quinn?
Quinn?

614
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,790
当然了 Carrie
Sure, Carrie.

615
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,150
我会尽全力的
Whatever you need.

616
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:59,320
Saul...
Saul...

617
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:04,970
今天过得怎样
How-how was your day?

618
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,210
挺好的
Had a good day.

619
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,680
实际上 过得非常好
Actually a really good day.

620
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:30,150
原谅我
Forgive me.

621
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:35,440
原谅你什么
For what?

622
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:41,560
我几乎忘了
I'd forgotten...

623
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,060
你有多么漂亮了
how beautiful you are.

624
