嗯，我知道
Yeah, no, I know,

6
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,049

8
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,469
嗯，我不知道他什么时候回复
Well, I don't know how quick he's gonna get back

9
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,679
有时他并不查看邮箱，所以…
'cause you know sometimes he doesn't check, so...

10
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,260
好，诗朗诵会结束
Yeah, and after the poetry reading,

11
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,183
我不回家
I'm not going home.

12

我是说，今天我生日
I mean, it's my birthday,

13
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:43,479
我想去夜总会

14
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,235
不，西蒙，我不想对她撒谎
No, Simon, I'm not gonna lie to her.

15
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:52,404
我不告诉她就行了呀
I'm just not gonna tell her.

16
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,660
我来停车
Let me go park the truck.

17
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,621

00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,927
喂，多萝西，你好吗？

好吧，我很好，谢了
I'm good, thanks for asking.

20
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:23,144
我去打电话，多要张门票
So I'll just call, I guess, and get extra tickets.

21
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,603
好，就这样
Yeah, sure.

22
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,355
- 我马上做  - 你好

你好，西蒙
Hi, Simon.

26
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,195
他说：“会打电话给我”
He says, "Call me."

27
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,323
是啊，是啊，我妈回来了
Yeah, yeah, she just got home.

28
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,993
她肯定听得到，她就站在这儿

29
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,370

- Hey, Luke. - How's it going, Clary?

30
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,816

00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,998
要咖啡吗？
Do you want some coffee?

32
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,416
你再讲我就得迟到了
If we keep talking, I'm gonna be late.

33
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,710
就那儿见，拜拜

你是不是用了…
Did you just use the...

35
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,771
你觉得呢？
How are you feeling?

36
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,190
好吧，为什么？
Fine, why?

37
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,028
记得晚上直接回来
You make sure you come straight home tonight.

38

Mom, come on. Just a poetry reading.

39
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:18,741

乔丝琳，你需要跟她谈谈
You need to talk to her, Jocelyn.

42
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,425
不行，她还没准备好
She's not ready, not yet.

43
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,927
不，她准备好了
Yes, she is.

44
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,428
没好的是你
You're not.

45
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,519
另外，谢谢你能来
By the way, thanks for doing this.

46
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,060
他很在意诗朗诵会
His poetry means a lot to him.

47
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,394
谁叫我们是朋友
That's what friends are for.

48
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,563

56
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,290
我听不下去了，要再来杯咖啡吗？
I can't listen to this. You want another coffee?

57
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,750
好
Yeah.

58
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:13,504
“包裹着的藏红花瓣，低声诉说死亡…”

59
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,588
卡布奇诺和浓咖啡

“雨落大地”
"Rain drowns the earth"

61
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,595
“寒风穿过致病的壁毯”
"Shivering breezes weave through a morbid tapestry

62
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,055
“溃烂化脓”

63
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,850
“我痛苦，全身肿胀”
"Turgid is my torment"

64
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,310

“雨落大地…”
"Rain drowns the earth..."

67
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,776
刚才那金发女孩蛮喜欢你啊
That blonde girl over there was totally flirting with you.

68
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:36,986
约她出来
Ask her out.

69
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,697
- 不，那不公平  - 为什么？
- Nah, it wouldn't be fair. - Why?

70
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,365
嗯，因为…
Well, because...

71
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,243
为了某人，我得空着自己
Because I'm saving myself for someone else.

72
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,286
谁？
Who?

我觉得更不好
Think he's getting worse.

77
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:04,596
你是他好友，得跟他讲
As his friend, you should probably tell him.

78
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,443
也许他诗歌很棒
Maybe his poetry is great,

79
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:08,142
我们不懂欣赏吧
we just don't know it yet.

80
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,146
进去看看
Let's go in here.

81
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,064
我想问下这符号的意思
I want to ask what that symbol means.

82
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,774
克拉蕾，我们不该进去
Clary, we'll never get in.

83
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,985
你个担心鬼
Such the eternal optimist.

84
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,070
这可不像你
This is so not like you.

85
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,239
就去这一次啦
Just go with it for once.

86
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:27,077
这符号代表什么？
What does that symbol mean?

87
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,500
- 什么符号？  - 嗯，哪里有符号？
- What symbol? - Yeah, what symbol?

88
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,288
就在那儿 你没… 你没看见吗？
It's right there. You don't... You don't see it?

89
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:36,295
没
No.

90
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,384
酷毙了
Hey, that was cool.

91
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,895
嘿，我们进来了
Yeah, we're fitting in.

92
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,772
跟着跳 跟着跳
Move it, go with it.

93
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,983
克拉蕾，要来一杯吗？
Clary, you want a drink?

94
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,151
好
Yeah.

95
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,085
克拉蕾，克拉蕾，那是什么
Clary, Clary, what is it?

96
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,217
你没看到吗？
You didn't see that?

97
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:52,563
我真的看到
I know what I saw.

98
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:54,224
让我们进去的那个男孩被杀了
They killed the guy that let us in the club.

99
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,226
- 你是喝迷幻药了？  - 天啦，我没喝，西蒙
- Did you drink something? - Yeah... No, Simon.

100
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,457
你知道，以前我就听说过
You know, I've heard sometimes

101
00:07:57,457 --> 00:07:59,271
有人把迷幻药注射到他们鼻子里
they pump hallucinogenic stuff into the air vents

102
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,647
这样玩会很刺激
to make sure people have a good time.

103
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:01,730
好了，那你怎会没事？
Okay, then how come you're fine?

104
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,608
我俩呼吸的是不同的空气？
Did we breathe different air?

105
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,568
我不懂，回家好了
I don't know. Let's just go home.

106
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,367
- 你没事吧？  - 没事
- You okay?   - Yeah, fine.

107
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,245
你整整睡了一天
You've been sleeping all day.

108
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,539
而且你昨晚很迟回来
And you didn't come home till late last night.

109
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,749
是的，不过我有回来，对吧？
Yeah, well, I'm home, okay?

110
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,919
不准走
Well, you can't go.

111
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,066
我卖了另一幅画
Well, I sold another painting.

112
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,130
一块去庆祝一下
I wanted to celebrate with you.

113
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,631
庆祝你唯一的买家？
To what, your one buyer?

114
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:50,651
好吧，他是谁？
Who is this guy anyway?

115
00:09:50,651 --> 00:09:52,759
他买你画估计是爱上你了
He probably just buys your stuff 'cause he's into you.

116
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,095
你肯定像哄卢克那样哄他的吧
I'm sure you'll just string him along like you do with Luke.

117
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,301
你干嘛非得那样说？
You really want to have that conversation?

118
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:58,765
那什么意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

119
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,934
- 西蒙  - 他就像我哥
- Simon. - He's like my brother.

120
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,352
我可不认为他这么想
I doubt he feels that way.

121
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,563
好吧，不过我要走了
Okay, well, I'm gonna go.

122
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,940
- 不，不，别走  - 别犯傻了
- No, no, you can't. - This is ridiculous.

123
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,568
- 你去哪里？  - 我只是去加瓦-琼斯咖啡厅
- Where are you going? - I'm just going to Java Jones.

124
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,695
- 我的天！  - 不，是我
- Jesus!     - No, just me.

125
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,863
走吧，西蒙
Come on, Simon.

126
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,657
克拉蕾 我有些事想告诉你，好吗？
Clary. There's something I want to tell you, okay?

127
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,952
以后再说啦
We can talk about this later.

128
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,537
拜拜，弗蕾夫人
Bye, Mrs. Fray.

129
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,757
看，我突然画了很多这些东西
Look, suddenly I'm drawing hundreds of these things,

130
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,634
我不懂怎么搞的
and I have no idea what they are.

131
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,720
我不知道… 我想我快疯了
I don't know. I think I'm going out of my mind.

132
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,139
也许你是《第三类接触中》的那个主角
You know, maybe you're like the guy in Close Encounters.

133
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,604
大家认为他是妄想狂
Everybody thought he was paranoid,

134
00:10:40,604 --> 00:10:42,184
但结果居然是…
and then there turned out to be, well...

135
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,811
幽浮，挺合理的，就像…
UFO, reasonable, like...

136
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,105
哎，天了，这怎么可能发生
Oh, God, this isn't happening.

137
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,068
- 怎么了？  - 这不可能
- What? - This isn't happening.

138
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,736
嘿，现在我被你吓到了
Okay, now you're freaking me out.

139
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,324
克拉蕾，你是…
Clary, are you...

140
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,540
你在看什么？
What are you looking at?

141
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,668
在这等我
Wait here.

142
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,485
乔丝，圣杯在哪？
Where's the Cup, Jocie?

143
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,452
你怎么找到我？
How did you find me?

144
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,247
这得谢你女儿
You can thank your daughter for that.

145
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,624
为何我能看见你而别人不行？
Why can I see you and no one else can?

146
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,168
我还想问你呢？
I was going to ask you the same question.

147
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,019
我怎么会跟你说话
I don't even know why I'm talking to you.

148
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,505
一个杀人狂，一个冷血杀手
You're a killer, a cold-blooded killer.

149
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,507
有这么温和的杀手？
As opposed to a peace-loving killer?

150
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,758
我很明白所看到的
I know what I saw.

151
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,135
你以为你明白
You think you know.

152
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,306
为什么我会画这些？
Why am I drawing this?

153
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,437
我猜对了，你不是凡人
So I was right, you're not a mundane.

154
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,689
等等，凡人？
Excuse me? What's a mundane?

155
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,331
就是人类
Someone from the human world.

156
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,151
我要不是人类，那我是什么？
If I'm not a human, then what am I?

157
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,488
去找圣杯
Go find the Cup.

158
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,213
- 什么时候发生的？  - 不，不
- When did this start? - No, no.

159
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,448
为什么我会画这些？
Why am I drawing this?

160
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,493
回答我！
Answer me!

161
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,751
西蒙
Simon.

162
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,314
你或许得接下，可能是你男友
Maybe you should answer that. Could be your boyfriend.

163
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,691
- 他不是我男友  - 那他知道吗？
- He's not my boyfriend. - Does he know that?

164
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,571
拜托，这很吵
Please. It's annoying.

165
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,075
妈，我要回来了
Mom, I'm coming home.

166
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,362
不，不，不 你不能回家
No, no, no. You can't come home.

167
00:13:46,362 --> 00:13:47,786
听到了吗？别回来
You understand me? You don't come home.

168
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:48,514
告诉卢克
You call Luke.

169
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:50,580
说瓦伦丁复活了，他会找到我
Tell him Valentine's alive and that he found me.

170
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:52,707
我爱你
I love you.

171
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,167
- 妈！ - 不，不！
- Mom!    - No, no!

172
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,460
妈！
Mom!

173
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,719
告诉瓦伦丁他不可能拿到圣杯
You tell Valentine he'll never have the Cup.

174
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,016
别喝… 别喝…
Don't you... Don't drink...

175
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,767
过来！别… 什么？
Come here! Don't... What?

176
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,065
快点！
Come on.

177
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,255
对不起 对不起 你还好吗？
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You okay?

178
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,507
没事，别动，好吗？
All right, look, don't move, all right?

179
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,529
妈？
Mom?

180
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,118
妈？
Mom?

181
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,153
来，起来
Come on. Come on.

182
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,660
够了！够了！够了！
That's enough! That's enough. That's enough.

183
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,413
它死了
It's dead.

184
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,250
那该死的到底是什么？
What the hell was that?

185
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,004
我说了你肯定不信
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

186
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,297
说说看
Try me.

187
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,593
它是邪灵
It was a demon.

188
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,555
你说得对
You're right.

189
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,058
我不信你
I don't believe you.

190
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,602
而那个东西
And that thing,

191
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,188
你在夜总会看到我杀死的那个…
that you saw me kill at the club, that...

192
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,066
也是一只邪灵
That was also a demon.

193
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,152
邪灵会附身任何活物
Demons can take possession of any living creature.

194
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,154
你谁都不能信
You can't trust anyone.

195
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,573
即使那人你很熟悉
Even people you think you know.

196
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,742
那我干嘛要信你？
So, why should I trust you?

197
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,666
因为我刚才救过你
I did just save your life.

198
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,338
多萝西，快开开门
Dorothea, open up, please.

199
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,425
你能…
Can you...

200
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,890
你知道我妈发生了什么吗？
Do you know what happened to my mom?

201
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:05,895
你知道吗？
Do you?

202
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,946
等等，你可以看到他？
Wait, you can see this guy?

203
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:10,608
当然可以 她是女巫
Of course she can. She's a witch.

204
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,699
从姜饼套房降级到了单卧室？
Downgraded from a gingerbread house to a one-bedroom?

205
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,659
你知道我妈在哪里吗？
Do you know where my mom is?

206
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,327
对不起，我不清楚
Sorry. I have no idea.

207
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:24,080
嗯，她曾提到一个名字… 瓦伦丁
Well, she mentioned a name... Valentine.

208
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,041
- 你最好离开  - 不，请不要这样
- You better leave. - No, please.

209
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,961
你不告诉我，我就不走
Not until you tell me something, anything.

210
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,492
看看骨牌占卜到什么
Let's see what the cards have to say.

211
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,037
对不起，我不信这些…
I'm sorry, but you know that I don't believe in any of...

212
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,246
坐下
Sit.

213
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,500
把手在牌上过一遍
Run your hands over the cards.

214
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,090
我妈妈画过这些
My mom painted these.

215
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:17,842
是的，你妈妈送的
Yes. They were a gift.

216
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,888
看看你拿到哪一张牌
Let's see which card gets picked.

217
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,166
大金杯
The Ace of Cups.

218
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,919
- 那是圣杯  - 那？
- That's the Mortal Cup. - So?

219
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,087
别理他
Ignore him.

220
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,081
这是圣杯神器
It's a Mortal Instrument,

221
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:56,589
我们族人三大圣物之一
one of the three holy objects of my people.

222
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:57,757
它怎么在这儿？
What's it doing here?

223
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,093
我不明白这跟我妈有什么关联
I don't understand what any of this has to do with my mom.

224
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,096
你母亲是暗影猎人，跟他一样
Your mother was a Shadowhunter, like him.

225
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,473
不，我妈是个画家
No, my mom is a painter.

226
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,725
她从没跟你说过，对吧？
She never told you any of this, did she?

227
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,277
我只知道的是她消失了
All I know is that she's gone,

228
00:21:09,277 --> 00:21:11,646
然后我不知道去哪里找她
and I have no idea where to start looking for her.

229
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,526
让我给你读心
Let me read you.

230
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,135
有东西封印了你的回忆
There's something blocking your mind.

231
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,805
我猜是你妈妈雇请了高人来保护你
My guess is your mother hired someone very skilled to protect you.

232
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,932
- 保护什么？  - 你的回忆
- From what? - Your own memories.

233
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,226
为什么？
Why?

234
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,271
我不懂她要我忘记什么
I don't remember anything she'd want me to forget.

235
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,876
等等
Wait.

236
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,420
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

237
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,851
搞什么？
What the hell?

238
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,978
你吓到我了
You scared me.

239
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,189
这究竟发生过什么？
What the hell happened here?

240
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,025
- 我妈妈不见了  - 什么？
- My mom's missing. - What?

241
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,944
有人抓了她，还毁了这里
Someone took her and destroyed the place.

242
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,577
他正帮我找她
This guy is helping me find her,

243
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,121
你看不到他，而且他…
but you can't see him, and he...

244
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,457
克拉蕾
Clary.

245
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,501
好吧
Great.

246
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,461
好吧，现在我也看不到他了
Okay, now I can't see him, either.

247
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,215
杰斯·维兰德，邪灵猎手
Jace Wayland, demon hunter.

248
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,345
西蒙·卢易斯，解锁师
Simon Lewis, Keymaster.

249
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:08,475
你是门卫吗？
Are you the Gatekeeper?

250
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:10,264
我不懂你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

251
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:13,059
等等 什么，你现在可以看到他了？
Wait. What, so you can see him now?

252
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,019
- 什么？我当然能看到他  - 可我以为…
- What? Of course I can see him. - But I thought...

253
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,771
- 不…  - 你说什么呢？
- No... - What are you talking about?

254
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,398
我被搞糊涂了
This is so confusing.

255
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,316
这是谁？
Who's this?

256
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,860
我爸爸，我两岁时他就死了
That's my dad. He died when I was two.

257
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,035
克拉蕾，等等
Clary, a moment.

258
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,278
等等，你妈消失了
So, wait, your mom is gone,

259
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:38,000
你却跟这染金发的追星小伙在一起？
and you're hanging around with some dyed-blond wannabe Goth weirdo?

260
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,294
你在哪儿遇到他的？
Where'd you come across this guy?

261
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:43,840
- 不，我没有 是他找我的  - 什么？他找你
- No, I didn't. He found me. - What? He found you?

262
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,217
- 不，我知道这听起来…  - 看看这个
- No, I know it sounds... - You should check this.

263
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,469
郑重声明，我头发金色是天生的
And for the record, my hair is naturally blond.

264
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:54,350
克拉蕾，克拉蕾，克拉蕾… 西蒙？
Clary, Clary, Clary... Simon?

265
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,144
她打过电话？
She called you?

266
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,980
你为什么不接？
Why didn't you pick up?

267
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,691
要是知道这么严重，我早接了
If I'd known it was serious, I would have picked up.

268
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,860
你都没接怎么会知道？
Well, how would you know if you didn't pick it up?

269
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,281
那是什么？
What's that?

270
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,618
没好事
Nothing good.

271
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:15,121
你懂她哪儿弄来这个的吗？
Do you have any idea where she got this?

272
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,998
我得找卢克
I've got to find Luke.

273
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,136
太奇怪了，他车在这儿
It's so weird. His truck's here.

274
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,762
来吧 这边
Come on. This way.

275
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,316
不，你在这等
No, you wait here.

276
00:24:35,316 --> 00:24:36,851
干嘛要听你的？
Who made you the boss?

277
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:40,396
没关系，这样有人来能通知我们
It's okay. Just let us know if anyone comes.

278
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,305
我认识卢克好多年
I've known Luke all these years,

279
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:45,193
但我都没下来过
but I've never been down here.

280
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:55,995
什么？
What?

281
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,080
快点，伙计！
Come on, mate!

282
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,511
伙计，听好…
Now, listen...

283
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:14,847
你要做的就是说真话
All you got to do, mate, is tell me the truth.

284
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:17,350
我说了，不知道圣杯在哪儿
I'm telling you, I don't know where the Cup is.

285
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,560
我知道你和乔丝关系好
I know you and Jocie are close.

286
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:21,437
我可不是傻子？
I'm not stupid, am I?

287
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,564
别这样回答
Don't answer that.

288
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,141
听我说，伙计
Listen to me, mate.

289
00:25:25,141 --> 00:25:27,443
只要告诉我圣杯在哪儿
Just tell me where the Mortal Cup is.

290
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,029
乔丝就会没事
And then Jocie will be fine.

291
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,664
卢克，说啊，告诉我
Lukey, tell me. Tell me the truth.

292
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:33,699
我不知道
I don't know.

293
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,868
你可别惹我生气
You don't want to make me angry.

294
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:38,162
- 我说了…  - 是吗？
- I'm telling you... - Do you?

295
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,698
我再问一遍，伙计
I'm going to ask you again, mate,

296
00:25:41,698 --> 00:25:43,084
圣杯在哪儿？
where's the Cup, huh?

297
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,669
我不知道
I don't know.

298
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:48,339
我们都需要它，卢克，不是吗？
We all want the same thing, Lukey boy, don't we?

299
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:52,009
不同之处，我觉得你知道它在哪儿
Difference is, I think you know where it is.

300
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,386
不是吗？
Don't you?

301
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,471
快点 快点 说啊！
Come on. Come on. Talk!

302
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:58,307
- 我们得走了  - 不，求你了，你要帮他
- We need to go. - No, please, you have to help him.

303
00:25:58,391 --> 00:25:59,684
你不懂
You don't understand.

304
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,061
他们是瓦伦丁的人
They work for Valentine.

305
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,804
他是个死人 我帮不了他
He's a dead man. I can't help him.

306
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:05,773
他是我家人
He's like family.

307
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,567
奇了怪
You know what's really amazing

308
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,570
你看上去还挺像人类
is how much you actually look like a human.

309
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,697
很棒啊？
Isn't it great?

310
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,328
求你了
Please.

311
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,205
你要发狂了？你要变身了？
Are you gonna get mad? You're going to change?

312
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:22,665
我要看你变身
I want to see you change.

313
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,168
给我露露你怎么变身的？
Show me how you can change. Huh?

314
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,504
看看 看看
Look at that. Look at that.

315
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,674
狼人来了
Dog boy's coming on.

316
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:32,925
你想搞我腿？
You want to hump my leg?

317
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,678
你搞我腿？喜欢这样？
You hump legs? You like that?

318
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,097
要嗅我屁股吗？
You want to smell my derriere?

319
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,603
我要看你　变身
I want to see you change!

320
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,939
告诉我乔丝琳把圣杯藏哪儿
You just got to tell me where Jocelyn hid the Cup.

321
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:48,941
然后你可以平安带回她
Then you can have her back.

322
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,693
她会平安无事的
She'll be safe and sound.

323
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,489
我没要她回来
I don't want her back.

324
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:57,158
我一点不在乎
I couldn't care less.

325
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,600
我这么多年
I have spent years

326
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,580
一直在讨好她和她的倔女儿，就是为圣杯
cozying up to that woman and her brat for the Mortal Cup.

327
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,333
潘伯恩，听我说
Pangborn, listen to me.

328
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:08,002
我也想把圣杯给瓦伦丁
I want to be the one to give her to Valentine.

329
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,545
呀，对
Yeah, right.

330
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:15,217
你在犯大错
You are making a big mistake.

331
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,428
我不信，你信他吗？
I don't believe you. Do you believe him?

332
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,646
- 克拉蕾，快跑！  - 克拉蕾，听我说！
- Clary, run!          - Clary, listen!

333
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,534
劳驾 警官？
Excuse me. Officer?

334
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,204
我要报案，有人闯入
I'd like to report a break-in.

335
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,206
一人失踪
And a missing person.

336
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,623
有人闯入我朋友的家…
My friend's house got broken into, and...

337
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,419
- 她妈妈失踪了  - 哦，不
- Her mom's missing. - Oh, no.

338
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,295
快跑！
Run!

339
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,267
- 你杀了两个警察！  - 他们不是警察
- You killed two cops! - They weren't cops.

340
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,560
快走！
Let's go!

341
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,322
克拉蕾
Clary.

342
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,325
你不能留在这儿 他们会抓到你的
You can't stay here. They'll find you.

343
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:07,288
卢克怎么会说他不在乎？
How could Luke say that he didn't care?

344
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:10,040
我从记事起就认识他了
I've known him for as long as I can remember.

345
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:11,805
他曾每晚都为我读故事
He used to read to me every night.

346
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:13,919
他天天来校接我好几年了
He's been picking me up at school for years.

347
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:16,672
也许这记忆不真实
Look, maybe those memories aren't real.

348
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,341
你不记得我说的了吗？
Do you remember what I told you?

349
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,343
谁都不能相信
You can't trust anyone.

350
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,221
不，我要找回妈妈，我要回家
No, I need to find my mom. I have to go home.

351
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:26,432
- 我肯定漏了什么！  - 听我说，好吗？
- There must be something that I missed! - Listen to me, okay?

352
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,517
我们会弄清的，但不是此时此地
We'll figure this out, but not here and not now.

353
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:31,228
你得到一个安全的地方
We need to get you to a safe place.

354
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:32,878
我是暗影猎人，克拉蕾
I'm a Shadowhunter, Clary,

355
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:34,857
我会誓死保护你
and I will protect you with my life.

356
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:38,319
你们在这儿，我以为你们紧跟着
There you guys are. I thought you were right behind me.

357
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:39,904
我丢了你们
I thought I'd lost you.

358
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,448
好吧，我跟着你
Okay. I'll follow you.

359
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,742
你确定吗？他刚杀了两个警察
Are you sure about that? 'Cause he just killed two cops.

360
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,035
呀，他们不是警察
Yeah, they weren't cops.

361
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,121
我觉得他们就是
They looked like real cops to me.

362
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:51,540
- 他们不是真警察  - 好吧
- They weren't real cops. - Okay.

363
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,461
那他们那儿弄来的警车？
So, where did they get the car?

364
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,591
他们不是真警察
They weren't real cops.

365
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,520
在这我们会很安全
We'll be safe in here.

366
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,396
这鬼地方是哪里？
What is this dump?

367
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,273
这不是鬼地方
This isn't a dump.

368
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,443
只不过你看不见
You just can't see it.

369
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,813
到底怎么了？他们做了什么？
What the hell is going on? What are they doing in here?

370
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,773
- 这是被邪灵咬伤  - 克拉蕾
- It's a demon bite. - Clary.

371
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,775
杰斯，做点什么！
Jace, do something!

372
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:02,243
接下来是不是你该撕掉你的衬衣
Is this the part when you start tearing off pieces of your shirt

373
00:31:02,243 --> 00:31:03,779
包扎我的伤口呢？
to bind my wounds?

374
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,021
如果你要我把这身衣服脱下来
If you wanted me to take my clothes off,

375
00:31:06,021 --> 00:31:07,449
只要你发话就行
you should've just asked.

376
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,419
只是有点发烧
It's just a fever.

377
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,637
她醒了
She's waking up.

378
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,114
我昏倒后你们给纹的？
I passed out, and you guys tattooed me?

379
00:31:52,114 --> 00:31:53,913
我以为这只在赌城才会发生
Thought that only happened in Vegas.

380
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,664
- 这不是纹身  - 是图符
- It's not a tattoo. - It's a rune.

381
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,233
它让你拥有一切：
They have them for everything,

382
00:31:57,233 --> 00:31:59,293
隐身术，强健之躯和自愈术
they make you invisible, strong, they heal.

383
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,708
它让你可见
They also make you visible.

384
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,421
所以我突然可以看到他
That's why I could suddenly see him.

385
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,590
- 即使你不吃饭…  - 不
- Even if you're hungry... - No.

386
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,887
事实上，这图符是让你可以看到我们
The fact that the rune had an effect on you explains why you can see us.

387
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,096
我没弄懂
I don't get it.

388
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,918
凡人是挺不过来的
Mundanes can't survive the process.

389
00:32:12,918 --> 00:32:14,850
他们无法承受这图符的力量，所以…
The runes are too strong for them, so...

390
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:16,977
现在，我们很确定你有暗影猎人的血脉
Now we definitely know you have Shadowhunter blood.

391
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:18,771
等等，那之前就不确定了？
Wait, it wasn't definite before?

392
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,398
她没死，才让我们更确定，是这样的
Well, it became definite when she didn't die. Yes.

393
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,068
看看合不合身
Here, see if these fit.

394
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,070
我们这不是天天有贵客的
It's not every day we get guests in here.

395
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,947
尤其少见女客人
Especially not girls.

396
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:31,700
是啊
Yeah.

397
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,251
我们要叫警察来吗？
Shouldn't we call the cops?

398
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,212
我指的是真警察
I mean, the real ones.

399
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,408
好主意
That's a great idea.

400
00:32:44,408 --> 00:32:46,382
我只是不懂我们为何没想到过
I just don't know why we haven't thought of that

401
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,592
在过去的这几千年中
for the past thousand years.

402
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,845
霍奇在等她
Hodge is ready for her.

403
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,265
他想在藏书馆单独见她
He wants to see her alone in the library.

404
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,768
霍奇是谁？
Who's Hodge?

405
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,895
他是这里的头
He's in charge of the Institute.

406
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,814
好吧，我们走
Okay, let's go.

407
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:05,275
无数的暗影猎人曾来此寻求庇护
Hundreds of Shadowhunters used to seek asylum here.

408
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,111
但你也看到了
But, as you can see,

409
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:09,655
现在只剩我们这几个了
right now, we're the only ones.

410
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,658
没有圣杯，我们只能等死
Without the Mortal Cup, we're a dying breed.

411
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,369
要么你是暗影猎人的后代
Either you're born of a Shadowhunter,

412
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,913
要么你有喝过圣杯之水
or you have to drink from the Mortal Cup.

413
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,422
你来自
You coming?

414
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,177
遥远的布鲁克林，对吧？
Pretty far from Brooklyn, isn't it?

415
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,972
离杰斯远点
Stay away from Jace.

416
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:42,521
你可能觉得霍奇有点古怪
You may find Hodge a little eccentric,

417
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,899
但他曾是最出色的暗影猎人之一
but he's one of the greatest Shadowhunters that's ever lived.

418
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,693
这给我
Here, give me that.

419
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,233
你不觉得这有点冒险
Don't you think it's a bit risky

420
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:29,863
让一个完全陌生的人
inviting a complete stranger

421
00:34:29,863 --> 00:34:31,570
闯进神院中心？
into the heart of the Institute?

422
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:34,239
不，我们可以相信她
No. I think we can trust her.

423
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:35,866
那她的凡人朋友呢？
And what about her mundane friend?

424
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,409
嗯，这是一时疏忽
Well, that was impulsive.

425
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,745
你一时疏忽，会弄砸事
When you're impulsive, things go badly.

426
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,175
当心
Just be careful,

427
00:34:46,175 --> 00:34:49,171
自愈心碎的图符是最疼的
the rune to fix a broken heart is the most painful one.

428
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:52,549
我保证适时让他们离开
They'll be out of here in a day, I promise.

429
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,682
杰斯
Jace.

430
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,440
她曾是最出色的猎人之一
She was one of the best,

431
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,025
你的母亲
your mum.

432
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,277
但我不明白为什么她…
But I don't understand why...

433
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:15,572
昨天你还只是个普通的女孩
Yesterday you were just a normal girl.

434
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,241
今天仿佛感觉到
Today you feel as though

435
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:20,202
你的世界彻底翻天覆地改变了
your whole world has been turned upside down.

436
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,209
你必须知道一件事
There's only one thing you need to know.

437
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:31,046
那是你小时候听到的故事
The stories you were told as a little girl

438
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,048
怪兽和梦魇
about monsters, nightmares,

439
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:36,426
篝火旁低诉的传说…
legends whispered around campfires...

440
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,054
他们都是真的
They're all true.

441
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,225
- 邪灵？  - 对
- Demon?    - Yes.

442
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:48,814
邪灵？
Demon?

443
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,482
不，狼人不是邪灵
No. Werewolves aren't demons.

444
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,985
我们和地下生物有过停战协议
We have a truce with Downworlders.

445
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,319
地下生物？
Downworlders?

446
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:57,197
是什么？14号街以下的人？
What is that, like people below 14th Street?

447
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:59,616
嗯，“地下生物”包括很多
Well, "Downworlders" pretty much sums everything up,

448
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,327
吸血鬼，狼人和术士
vampires, werewolves, Warlocks.

449
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:04,163
术士，很酷啊
Warlocks. Cool.

450
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,832
你怎么杀死一只僵尸的？
So, how do you kill a zombie?

451
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,000
我们没杀
We don't.

452
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,835
当然他们已经死了
Of course, they're already dead.

453
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,712
不，他们不存在
No. They don't exist.

454
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,508
那么这就是大家所说的圣杯吧
So, that's the famous Cup everyone's talking about.

455
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,719
只是个模型，不过也对
A replica. But yes.

456
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:24,183
那你知道杰斯敏感易怒咯
You know, Jace has got a real chip on his shoulder.

457
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:24,933
你也一样的
You would, too,

458
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,186
如果你小时候亲眼看到你父亲被杀
if you saw your father murdered when you were a child.

459
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,021
要不是他，我们全死了
If it weren't for him, we'd be dead.

460
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:32,357
我都说不清他救了我们多少次了
He saved our lives more times than I care to admit.

461
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,526
好吧
Right.

462
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:41,950
据传说
The legend goes,

463
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:45,621
十字军曾召唤过一位天使
the Crusaders summoned an angel,

464
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,123
天使拉齐尔
the Angel Raziel.

465
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:51,251
拉齐尔将自己的鲜血倒入圣杯
Raziel poured his blood into a cup,

466
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,151
那些喝过其血的人
and those who drank from it

467
00:36:53,151 --> 00:36:54,963
变成半天使，半凡人
became half angel, half human.

468
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:56,798
暗影猎人
Shadowhunters.

469
00:36:57,466 --> 00:37:00,427
这会遗传给他们的子子孙孙
As did their children and their children's children.

470
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,638
有强大力量的族群
Beings of immense power,

471
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:05,098
足以恢复和平
strong enough to restore balance

472
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:08,560
保护世界，抵御邪灵
and protect the world in a war against evil.

473
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:10,896
这是无赢家的斗争
A war that can never be won,

474
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,316
但永无休止
but must always be fought.

475
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,403
因为邪灵永生不息
Demons don't die easily.

476
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:23,659
但我们却终有一死
Whereas we, we remained all too mortal.

477
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,870
你们干嘛不用圣杯
Why didn't they just use the Cup

478
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,412
繁衍出更多的暗影猎人？
to create more Shadowhunters?

479
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:29,122
瓦伦丁也这么说过
Valentine's exact words.

480
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,750
克拉夫－圣杯守护者
The Clave, the keepers of the Cup,

481
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,752
他们害怕其力量
they were afraid of using its power.

482
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,797
他们知道没人能承受住圣杯的力量而存活
They knew that hardly anyone who drank from it survived.

483
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:41,343
瓦伦丁·摩根斯坦召集了一群朋友
Valentine Morgenstern drew a circle of friends together,

484
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:44,596
一群年轻妄想的暗影猎人
young, idealistic Shadowhunters,

485
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:50,686
帮他从克拉夫手里偷到了圣杯
to help him steal the Mortal Cup from the Clave.

486
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,816
但瓦伦丁并不想保护人类
But he didn't want to protect humanity.

487
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:00,445
他相信暗影猎人可以进化
He believed there had to be an evolution of Shadowhunters,

488
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:02,197
变得更具力量
something more powerful.

489
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:05,033
他开始试着使用圣杯
He began experimenting, using the Mortal Cup.

490
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,453
并学会了召唤邪灵
He learned how to summon demons.

491
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,896
他甚至给自己注射过邪灵的鲜血
He even injected himself with demon blood

492
00:38:12,896 --> 00:38:14,251
以此来控制他们
so he could control them.

493
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:17,254
他想统治一切
He wanted to rule.

494
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,258
为了阻止他，你妈妈
Your mother, to prevent that,

495
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,635
偷走了圣杯
stole the Cup from him,

496
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,387
而后消失不见
and vanished into thin air.

497
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,432
但要是只有她知道圣杯在哪里，那么…
But if she's the only one that knows where the Cup is, then...

498
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,225
也许不只她
Maybe she isn't.

499
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,477
她可能告诉某人了
Maybe she told someone else.

500
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:36,231
一个没有人猜到她知道的人
Someone who doesn't know she knows.

501
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,904
赛任兄弟们在等她
The Silent Brothers are ready for her.

502
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:48,160
为什么霍奇不一块来？
Why didn't Hodge come with us?

503
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,162
他好多年没离开神院了
He hasn't left the Institute in years.

504
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,747
有人说是诅咒
Some say it's a spell.

505
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,999
他有恐旷症吧
He's agoraphobic.

506
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:01,214
是他吗？
Is that him?

507
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:03,258
不，那是哈罗德，扫地工
No, that's Harold, the groundskeeper.

508
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,635
是他
That's him.

509
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:21,902
你想好要经历这些了吗？
Are you sure you want to go through with this?

510
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:27,115
我们会帮你解开回忆
We will help you to remember.

511
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:15,872
你会吵醒亡灵的
You'll wake the dead.

512
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:23,296
难以置信，这地方就在城市外
I can't believe this place is just outside the city.

513
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,689
欢迎来到　骸骨之城
Welcome to the City of Bones.

514
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:50,115
这是赛任兄弟汲取力量的源泉
This is where the Silent Brothers draw their power,

515
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:53,034
暗影猎人的骸骨和骨灰
from the bones and ashes of Shadowhunters.

516
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,745
他们都埋在这里？
All of them are buried here?

517
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,914
对，有一天
Yes. One day,

518
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,709
我会在这里
that's gonna be me.

519
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,845
我只能跟到这儿了
This is as far as I go.

520
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,472
你不会有事的
You'll be fine.

521
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:17,726
你之前试过吗？
So you've done this before?

522
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:20,687
没
No.

523
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:35,911
你必须倾听自己的内心
You must listen with your mind.

524
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:31,216
妈？
Mom?

525
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,135
妈？
Mom?

526
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,686
去，去
Go. Go.

527
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:50,819
克拉蕾，这是卢克
Clary, this is Luke,

528
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,696
我最好的朋友
my dearest friend.

529
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:54,656
你可以信任他
You can trust him.

530
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,283
你好，克拉蕾
Hi, Clary.

531
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,495
别说
Don't tell.

532
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,717
别碰那老东西
Don't touch that old thing.

533
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,512
只是个旧杯子，克拉蕾
It's just an old cup, Clary.

534
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,896
克拉蕾！克拉蕾，你还好吗？
Clary! Clary, are you okay?

535
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,149
克拉蕾？
Clary?

536
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:37,616
封印比预想的要强
Your block is stronger than I anticipated.

537
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:40,368
解铃还须系铃人了
It can only be undone by the one who put it there.

538
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:42,495
我不清楚系铃人是谁
I have no idea who put it there.

539
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:44,289
你写出来了
You wrote it.

540
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,965
你记得是相反的印象
Your mind remembers the inverted image.

541
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:56,343
要换个角度看
Just have to look at it differently.

542
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,554
“贝恩”
"B-A-N-E."

543
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:02,932
- 贝恩  - 是谁？
- Bane.    - Who?

544
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:05,810
马格努斯·贝恩，我记得他是个术士
Magnus Bane. He's a warlock. I should have known.

545
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:07,896
好，那找他去
Well, let's go talk to him then.

546
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,481
不能这样去
Not like that.

547
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,776
你需要伊莎贝尔的协助
We're gonna need some help from Isabelle.

548
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,653
这是上衣
This is a top.

549
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,237
是连衣裙
It's a dress.

550
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:19,991
我穿不了
I can't pull this off.

551
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,826
就差双合适的鞋子…
Well, actually, with the right shoes...

552
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,370
不，我是说…
No, I mean...

553
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:26,164
这衣服太紧，像包了一层皮一样
This dress is so tight, it's like a second skin.

554
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:30,001
你难道没有别的了吗？
Don't you have anything else?

555
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,671
要是你穿得像凡人那样去的话
If you go out looking like your mundane self,

556
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:35,048
我们接近不了马格努斯·贝恩
we won't get within a hundred feet of Magnus Bane.

557
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,300
他是布鲁克林的高级术士
He's the High Warlock of Brooklyn.

558
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:39,469
别抱怨了，过来
Now, stop complaining, come over here.

559
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:43,932
拿着
Hold this.

560
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,396
亚力克好像很讨厌我
That guy Alec doesn't like me very much.

561
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:51,690
亚力克是我的兄弟
That guy Alec is my brother.

562
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,945
杰斯知道亚力克对他的感觉吗？
Does Jace know how Alec feels about him?

563
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,740
很明显吗？
Is it that obvious?

564
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:03,034
这真没什么大不了的
It's really not that big of a deal.

565
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:04,994
对我也一样
It isn't to me either.

566
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,214
但对克拉夫不同
But it is to the Clave.

567
00:45:07,214 --> 00:45:08,623
规则不是我定的
I don't make the rules.

568
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,628
看，现在多漂亮
See? You look pretty.

569
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:16,500
干嘛要穿得这么妖艳
How is being dressed like a hooker

570
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,549
会帮我找到妈妈？
gonna help me find my mom?

571
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,009
放松点，那些只是我的衣服而已
Easy now, those are my clothes.

572
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:22,220
亚力克，她看上去漂亮吧？
Doesn't she look great, Alec?

573
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,451
她看上去就像
She looks like someone

574
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:25,849
留电话号码在浴室墙上的人
whose phone number should be on a bathroom wall.

575
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:32,981
我觉得你很漂亮
I think you look great.

576
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:49,831
等等，我来过这里
Wait, I've been here.

577
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,738
- 等等  - 怎么了？
- Wait.     - What?

578
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,539
这样更好点？
Is that better?

579
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:32,957
更好了
It's better.

580
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:49,015
嘿，嘿，嘿
Well, well, well.

581
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:50,433
瞧瞧这儿
Look-a here.

582
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:53,228
什么风把人神的孩子们吹到这儿
I don't remember inviting any children of the Nephilim.

583
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,105
马格努斯·贝恩，我们要谈谈
Magnus Bane. We need to talk.

584
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:57,982
我不喜欢你们
You know I don't like you guys.

585
00:46:58,066 --> 00:46:59,408
但我还让你们待在这儿
But I'll let you stay,

586
00:46:59,408 --> 00:47:01,277
只是因为这火辣宝贝
but only because of the hot one.

587
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:02,946
- 谢谢  - 谢谢
- Thanks. - Thank you.

588
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:04,113
什么？
What?

589
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,741
我说的是他
I meant him.

590
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,660
蓝眼睛的那位
The one with the blue eyes.

591
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:13,498
还有克拉蕾
And because of Clary.

592
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,708
等等，你怎么知道她名字？
Wait. How do you know her name?

593
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:17,252
跟我来
Come with me.

594
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,049
- 你妈妈呢？  - 她失踪了
- Where's your mother? - She's missing.

595
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,052
原来如此
That explains it.

596
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,440
她每年都带你来这儿
Every year, she brought you here.

597
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,099
从来没有漏过一次
She never missed an appointment.

598
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:35,728
我在你身上下的咒语是最成功的
Not every spell turns out as perfect as the one I did on you.

599
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:41,025
一旦你开始画天使图符
As soon as you started drawing the angelic rune,

600
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,528
说明你的记忆又回来了
it was a sign your memory was surfacing.

601
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,196
我将此咒深藏在你记忆中
I had built that into your mind

602
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,740
她就能适时带你回来封印
so that she knew when to bring you back.

603
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,993
暗影世界里的一切，你都会忘记
What you saw from the shadow world,

604
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:52,245
即使你看过
you would forget, even as you saw it.

605
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:54,122
可你越长大
But as you grew older,

606
00:47:54,122 --> 00:47:56,082
你需要封印的次数也越来越多
you needed my treatment more frequently.

607
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:58,543
她知道有一天非得告诉你
She knew she had to tell you one day,

608
00:47:58,626 --> 00:47:59,794
但想等你准备好后
but until you were ready,

609
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:02,204
她想封印回忆
she wanted to keep the block on your mind.

610
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:03,798
这就是她想做的
It was exactly how she wanted it.

611
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,057
我们要在这儿待多久？
How long do you think we're gonna be here?

612
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:14,350
西蒙，放松点，好吗？
Relax, Simon, okay?

613
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,233
别喝！
Don't drink that!

614
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:26,070
西蒙！西蒙！
Simon! Simon!

615
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,158
时间会消磨封印
It'll wear off over time.

616
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,744
现在已经磨去了，要么你不会来这儿
It's already wearing off, or you wouldn't be here.

617
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,329
我还是记不起来
I need to remember.

618
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,826
我妈没有多少时间了
My mom doesn't have time.

619
00:48:35,826 --> 00:48:38,166
求你了，你肯定能做点什么
Please, there must be something you can do.

620
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:48,509
你就是买我母亲画的人
You're the one who's been buying all my mom's paintings.

621
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:52,513
你为什么每幅都买？
Why did you buy all of them?

622
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:53,973
我清楚她需要钱
I knew she needed the money.

623
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:55,475
你甚至有我爸爸的画像
You even have a portrait of my dad.

624
00:48:57,936 --> 00:48:59,520
那不是你爸
That's not your dad.

625
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:01,356
他只是战死在伊朗的一名士兵
He's a soldier who died in Iraq.

626
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,358
乔丝琳从没见过他
Jocelyn never even met the guy.

627
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:05,109
有人请她画的
She was asked to paint his portrait,

628
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,778
但这对一位寡妇来说太痛苦了
but it was too painful for the widow.

629
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:08,473
她保留着画，所以…
She kept the picture so...

630
00:49:08,473 --> 00:49:10,365
她就能假装他是我爸爸
She could pretend he was my dad.

631
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,285
她做的一切都是为了你
Everything she did, she did for you.

632
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:15,954
你妈妈生命中的一切：
Your mother's whole existence,

633
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:17,997
逃跑，躲藏，谎言
the running, the hiding, the lies,

634
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:19,958
都是为了你的安全
were to keep you safe.

635
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,127
她有跟我说过什么真话吗？
Was anything she ever told me true?

636
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:28,216
你头脑里藏着一幅宝藏图，克拉蕾
There's a treasure map inside your head, Clary.

637
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,969
找到圣杯，它能带你找到你妈妈
Find the Cup, and it will lead you to your mother.

638
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:32,595
他们把西蒙带走了
They've taken Simon.

639
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:34,347
- 谁？  - 吸血鬼
- Who?   - Vampires.

640
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,059
别忘了
Just remember,

641
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:41,270
你妈妈躲避的正是暗影猎人
it was Shadowhunters your mother was running from.

642
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:44,482
我们去找西蒙
Let's go find Simon.

643
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,030
我们不能闯进吸血鬼的老巢，我们从没试过
We can't break into a vampire's lair, we never learned.

644
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:53,700
- 又开始了你  - 杰斯，这你知道的
- Don't start again. - Jace, you know the rules.

645
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:54,943
伙计，我们来这干嘛？
Guys, what are we doing here?

646
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,452
我们不是要找西蒙吗？
I thought we were trying to find Simon.

647
00:49:56,536 --> 00:49:58,955
我们知道他在哪，只是需要先拿些东西
We know where he is. We just need to pick up a few things.

648
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:03,543
这是什么？你们和教堂有某种约定？
What is this, some kind of deal you have with the church?

649
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:06,858
邪灵在世界各地都有
Demons exist all across the world

650
00:50:06,858 --> 00:50:08,589
而且外形各异
in their varying, different forms.

651
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:11,676
暗影猎人从不单信某个宗教
Shadowhunters cling to no particular religion,

652
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:14,345
因此，所有宗教都能协助我们作战
and in turn all religions assist us in our battle.

653
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:17,432
我们自如穿梭在犹太教堂
We could have as easily gone to a Jewish synagogue

654
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,017
或神道教塔…
or a Shinto temple or...

655
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:22,979
在这
Here it is.

656
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:32,613
在每个教堂的祭坛底下…
Beneath every altar in every church...

657
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:36,159
都能找到这个
you'll find this.

658
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,465
那你们信仰什么？
So, what do you believe in?

659
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,216
我信仰自己
I believe in myself.

660
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,676
我知道杀死邪灵是我的职责
I know my job is to kill demons.

661
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:55,386
其它我一概不信
I don't have to believe in anything else.

662
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,721
那天使拉齐尔呢？
What about the Angel Raziel?

663
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:57,972
那是美丽的传说
Yeah, makes for a nice story.

664
00:50:58,056 --> 00:50:59,807
- 但霍奇说…  - 是啊，霍奇
- But Hodge thinks... - Yeah, Hodge.

665
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,559
他还有很多没说
He needs to get out more.

666
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:04,312
- 我原以为…  - 听着，我一直在猎杀邪灵
- I thought... - Listen, I've been hunting demons

667
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:05,688
已经花掉了我三分之一的生命
for over a third of my life,

668
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:08,399
到目前为止，从未见过天使
and in all that time, I've never seen an angel.

669
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:09,776
这儿
Here.

670
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:12,820
这，你拿这个
Here, you take this one.

671
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:15,865
我不会…
I don't...

672
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:17,658
这，我教你
Here, let me show you.

673
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:20,536
这是一把杀吸血鬼的枪，必须瞄准他们的心脏
It's a vampire gun. Must pierce the heart.

674
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:23,081
推上来，对着胸膛
Push it up against the chest.

675
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:24,499
开火
Fire.

676
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:29,670
再装枪 重发
Recharge. Then you're good to go again.

677
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:39,097
死人客栈？
Hotel of Death?

678
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,140
他们也有幽默感
You can't say they don't have a sense of humor.

679
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:42,350
快点
Come on.

680
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,606
- 她怎么办？  - 她很勇敢
- What is it about her? - She's brave.

681
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,566
我们暗影猎人都勇敢
We're Shadowhunters, we're all brave.

682
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,401
她不像我们那样抚养长大，她不同
She wasn't raised like us, she's different.

683
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:55,029
她会连累我们被杀
She's gonna get us all killed.

684
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:58,092
是西蒙的衬衫
Simon's shirt.

685
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:31,667
他在上面
He's up here.

686
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:38,799
西蒙
Simon.

687
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:51,854
- 我的天，我的天，西蒙  - 克拉蕾
- Oh, my God, oh, my God, Simon. - Clary.

688
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,820
不，我能触到他了！
No, I can feel him!

689
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:03,699
搭把手 快点，快点
Give me a hand. Come on, come on.

690
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:06,661
这该死的靴子！
These damn boots!

691
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,414
这儿
Here.

692
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:11,624
好
Here you go.

693
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,961
- 快点  - 伙计，稳住
- Come on. - Guys, steady.

694
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:20,925
慢点
Slowly.

695
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:33,062
他还活着！
He's alive!

696
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:34,313
小心
Careful.

697
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:39,610
快走，他们要的不是我
Go on. Get out. They don't want me.

698
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:41,696
要的是你，他们要的是圣杯
They want you, they want the Cup.

699
00:54:57,586 --> 00:54:59,088
- 快点，走  - 天啊
- Come on. Let's go. - Oh, God.

700
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:00,756
快！
Let's go!

701
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:05,136
不，这儿
No, here.

702
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,148
- 这儿！  - 走！
- In here! - Go!

703
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:34,874
杰斯
Jace.

704
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,208
你身后！
Behind you!

705
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:43,692
快点！快点！
Come on! Come on!

706
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,685
克拉蕾！
Clary!

707
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:44,795
他们人数太多
There's too many of them.

708
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:46,630
抱点信念
Have a little faith.

709
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,119
跑！
Run!

710
00:58:30,758 --> 00:58:32,843
杰斯，给我把短刀
Jace, I need a knife.

711
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:37,431
- 日出  - 快走
- The sun. - Let's go.

712
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,276
帮西蒙
You help Simon.

713
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:04,375
克拉蕾！
Clary!

714
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:09,046
抓住！
Hold on!

715
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,298
克拉蕾！
Clary!

716
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:24,019
谢谢
Thank you.

717
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:28,899
你救了西蒙
For saving Simon.

718
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:45,499
- 还好吗？  - 我没事，我没事
- Are you okay? - I'm okay, I'm okay.

719
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:05,936
克拉蕾
Clary.

720
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:08,731
能和你谈谈吗？
Can I talk to you?

721
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:11,525
行，我正要去看西蒙
Yeah, I was just gonna go see Simon.

722
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:16,238
- 我希望你离开这儿  - 什么？
- I want you to leave here. - What?

723
01:00:16,322 --> 01:00:17,740
你差点让我们送死
You almost got us killed.

724
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:20,409
对不起，我们别无选择
I'm sorry, we didn't have a choice.

725
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:22,036
要救西蒙，而杰斯…
I mean, we had to save Simon, and Jace...

726
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,204
杰斯应该拯救世界
Jace thinks he needs to save the world.

727
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,750
但你没鼓励他这么做
But you don't need to encourage him to do it.

728
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:28,800
这就是你们要做的
But that's what you guys do.

729
01:00:28,884 --> 01:00:32,671
对，我们　要做的
Yes, us. What we do.

730
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:35,090
我们是团队，你是累赘
We're a team, you're deadweight.

731
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:38,302
- 凡人  - 我不是凡人
- A mundane. - I'm not a mundane.

732
01:00:39,428 --> 01:00:41,535
你要是表现得有半点勇敢
And if you were half as brave as you pretend to be,

733
01:00:41,535 --> 01:00:42,306
就得承认…
you'd admit that...

734
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:43,724
什么？
What?

735
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:45,886
你承认你爱上了杰斯
You'd admit that you're in love with Jace,

736
01:00:45,886 --> 01:00:47,353
这才是千真万确的
and that's what this is really about.

737
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:52,066
你敢再这样说一下…
If you ever say anything like that again...

738
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,027
我定杀死你
I'll kill you.

739
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,806
- 我晕了多久？  - 一整天
- How long was I out? - All day.

740
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,391
你的眼镜
Found your glasses.

741
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:27,434
- 有一边镜片裂了  - 嗯
- One of the lenses cracked. - Yeah.

742
01:01:36,485 --> 01:01:38,195
好神奇
How weird.

743
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,908
我似乎不需要它了
I don't seem to need them anymore.

744
01:01:45,953 --> 01:01:48,539
那你在画什么？
So, what are you drawing?

745
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,208
没什么
Nothing.

746
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:03,387
- 你还好吗？  - 还好
- You okay?     - Yeah.

747
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:04,805
这太疯狂了
It was crazy.

748
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:10,811
对不起之前我不相信你
I'm sorry I didn't believe you before.

749
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:12,396
现在我信了
Now I get it.

750
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:15,649
还有…
And...

751
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:19,403
当时我昏倒了
And I must have passed out,

752
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:21,655
接着你就出现
and then you showed up.

753
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:24,116
听着
Listen,

754
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:27,703
我知道我总是那个要被依赖的人
I know I've always been the one who needed you

755
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:29,121
比起你依赖我来
more than you needed me.

756
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:30,748
- 不是真的  - 是真的
- That's not true. - Yes, it is,

757
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:32,332
但我不在乎
but I never cared.

758
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:42,676
我只有妈妈，卢克和你了
I've only ever had my mom, Luke and you.

759
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:46,430
别乱想你对我来说不重要
Don't ever imagine that you weren't important to me.

760
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,099
- 好吧  - 好吧
- Okay.   - Okay.

761
01:03:32,601 --> 01:03:34,603
你跟钢琴有仇吗？
What did that piano ever do to you?

762
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:37,064
好像失去唯一真爱一样
You play it like you've lost your only love.

763
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:39,817
不幸的是我唯一真爱就是自己
Unfortunately, my one true love remains myself.

764
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,652
至少你不用愁遭拒绝
Well, at least you don't have to worry about rejection.

765
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:42,591
那也不一定
Not necessarily.

766
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:45,614
我有时会自我分裂，寻求刺激
I turn myself down occasionally just to keep it interesting.

767
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:47,658
你弹得很有热情
You do play that with a lot of passion.

768
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:48,919
这才有问题
Well, that's the problem.

769
01:03:48,919 --> 01:03:50,369
我不该投入太多感情
I play it with too much emotion.

770
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:53,696
本应该只是简单地音符重现
It's supposed to be played with a simple representation of notes,

771
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:54,581
而不是诠释
no interpretation.

772
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:00,754
音乐就该有感情
Music is supposed to have emotion.

773
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:06,844
邪灵对交错的音调才有反应
Demons react to certain frequencies when two tones cross.

774
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:09,137
才能使他们癫狂
Drives them crazy.

775
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:15,310
看，巴赫发现这点并构建了一个体系
See, Bach discovered this and put it into a system using

776
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:18,188
用数字序列融合音调
a mathematical progression of tonal combinations

777
01:04:18,272 --> 01:04:20,107
可以显现邪灵
that allows us to expose demons.

778
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:26,864
那巴赫也是个暗影猎人咯？
So Bach was a Shadowhunter?

779
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:28,991
- 是的  - 这么说…
- Yes.        - So...

780
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:34,204
巴赫对于邪灵们就像大蒜对于吸血鬼
Bach is to demons what garlic is to vampires.

781
01:04:35,289 --> 01:04:36,623
也对吧
Kind of.

782
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:38,709
我是说：大蒜会被用尽
I mean, you can run out of garlic.

783
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,627
但音乐却无止境
You can't really run out of music.

784
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:46,633
那里放着你的玩意吗？
Is that where you keep all your toys?

785
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:49,970
有趣得多
It's way more fun.

786
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:51,597
来吧
Come on.

787
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,348
这是穿梭门
It's a portal.

788
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:55,684
像百慕大一样的自然现象
Like the Bermuda Triangle, it's a natural phenomenon.

789
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:57,644
神院围绕它而建
The Institute was built around it.

790
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:01,315
据说神院是纽约最早的建筑
Some say that the Institute was the first building in New York.

791
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:03,775
所以它…
So it's...

792
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:06,194
空间不都只是直线型的
Dimensions aren't all just straight lines.

793
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:07,905
也会有弯曲
There's bends,

794
01:05:07,988 --> 01:05:09,573
折叠，凹角
folds and nooks.

795
01:05:10,157 --> 01:05:12,868
有点难以解释，不过
It's a little bit difficult to explain, but

796
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:16,663
穿梭门能带你到任何你想去的地方
the Portal can take you wherever you want to go in this dimension.

797
01:05:18,999 --> 01:05:21,001
一旦穿过表面
So, as soon as you break that surface,

798
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,503
你就会被送到你心底最深处
you're transported to wherever your deepest thoughts lie.

799
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:24,630
那意味着…
So that means...

800
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:26,423
- 我妈妈…  - 等下
- My mom... - Wait.

801
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:29,927
我们训练一生才懂得使用它
We spend our entire lives training how to use it,

802
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,512
进入前要先想象一下所去之处
visualizing where it will take us before we step into it,

803
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,932
那必须要非常集中精力
and that takes incredible focus.

804
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:41,104
如果没有经过正确训练而进入的话
If you were to step into it without the proper training,

805
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:42,966
你将永无安定
you could end up in limbo,

806
01:05:42,966 --> 01:05:44,942
永生困在记忆之中
lost in your own mind forever.

807
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,237
这儿
Here.

808
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:51,114
我做给你看
Let me show you.

809
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:52,491
快点
Come on.

810
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:56,536
别偷看
No peeking.

811
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:35,075
很酷吧，对吧？
Pretty cool, isn't it?

812
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:37,577
现在…
Now...

813
01:06:38,412 --> 01:06:40,789
你和我…
You and I...

814
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:42,958
要庆祝你的生日
Have a birthday to celebrate.

815
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:44,376
你怎么知道？
How did you know?

816
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:47,170
我之前找你，就查到过
Research. When I was trying to find you.

817
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:53,635
不会有人来这儿
No one comes up here anymore.

818
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:55,429
这里属于我们
We have the place to ourselves.

819
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,390
美得窒息了
This is breathtaking.

820
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:21,830
抱歉，没有蛋糕
Sorry there's no cake.

821
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:24,166
我原本就没期望
Well, I was expecting nothing,

822
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,917
这已很棒了
so this is great.

823
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:29,504
不过，每个人都该在生日那天得到些什么
Well, everyone should get something for their birthday.

824
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,677
你生日得到什么？
What did you get?

825
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:37,763
大多数是武器
Weapons mostly.

826
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:40,891
希望没让你吃惊
I'm sure that doesn't surprise you.

827
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:42,809
现在没有什么会让我吃惊
At this point, nothing really does.

828
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:48,231
当我九岁时…
When I was nine...

829
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,318
我父亲送了我一只隼
My father gave me a falcon.

830
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,278
他要我让它听话
He told me to make it obedient.

831
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:55,489
我本该弄瞎那只鸟
I was supposed to keep the bird blind,

832
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,657
但我做不到
but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

833
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,747
相反的是，我抚摸它的翅膀
Instead, I touched and stroked its wings

834
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:01,828
直到它信任我
until it trusted me.

835
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,081
我以为完美地驯服了它
I tamed it to perfection.

836
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:06,763
我把它带给父亲
I took it to my father,

837
01:08:06,763 --> 01:08:09,628
希望父亲为我所做的感到骄傲
expecting him to be proud of what I'd done.

838
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:11,755
他说：
He said,

839
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,091
“我是要你让他听话”
"I told you to make it obedient.

840
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:17,052
“不是要你教它爱你”
"Instead, you taught it to love you.

841
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:19,304
“你没有驯服它，你毁了它”
"You didn't tame it, you broke it."

842
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,974
他带走鸟，并割了它的脖子
Then he took the bird and he broke its neck.

843
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,937
我当时哭了整整一夜，此后再没哭过
I cried all night and I never cried again.

844
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,272
你原谅他吗？
Did you ever forgive him?

845
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:32,692
他这么做是要我强大
He did it to make me stronger.

846
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,741
那是你名字维兰德的意义吗？
Does that stand for Wayland?

847
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:47,833
午夜
Midnight.

848
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:49,793
瞧瞧这些
Watch this.

849
01:09:08,395 --> 01:09:10,438
一个女孩说要一颗大宝石
When a girl says she wants a big rock,

850
01:09:10,522 --> 01:09:12,774
但她并非就是这个意思
she doesn't literally mean a big rock.

851
01:09:12,858 --> 01:09:15,610
每个暗影猎人都有属于自己的魔石
Every Shadowhunter should have their own witchlight.

852
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,163
有人在
We have company.

853
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:28,915
那只是霍奇的鸟
That's Hodge's bird.

854
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:33,044
我们得走了
We should probably go.

855
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,504
是啊
Yeah.

856
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:18,798
我们真得走了
We should definitely go.

857
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:39,945
抱歉忘记告诉你会定时喷水
Sorry about the sprinkler system.

858
01:10:40,362 --> 01:10:41,655
别提它了
I forgot about that.

859
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:46,284
要去睡了吗？
You going to sleep?

860
01:10:46,368 --> 01:10:47,827
累了吗？
Well, aren't you tired?

861
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:49,996
我从没这样清醒
I've never been more awake.

862
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:58,171
- 西蒙，我以为你…  - 睡了？
- Simon, I thought you were... - Asleep?

863
01:10:58,338 --> 01:10:59,506
之前是的
Yeah, I was.

864
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,132
我们只不过…
We were just...

865
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:02,658
下次，最好是
Next time, it might be a nice idea

866
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:04,761
你得说你已经有个男人在床上
to mention that you already have a man in your bed,

867
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:06,513
我们才不会这么尴尬了
so we can avoid such uncomfortable situations.

868
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:07,558
你让他到你床上？
You invited him to bed?

869
01:11:07,558 --> 01:11:08,890
我知道这挺荒唐的，是不是？
I know, it's ridiculous, isn't it?

870
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:10,183
不可能一切合心意
We would never have all fit.

871
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:12,143
我没有让他到我床上
I didn't invite him into bed.

872
01:11:12,227 --> 01:11:14,020
只是接吻而已
We were just kissing.

873
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,274
你太快丢掉我俩的爱了
How swiftly you dismiss our love.

874
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:18,858
杰斯…
Jace...

875
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,652
西蒙，很晚了，对不起吵醒你
Simon, it's late, and I'm sorry we woke you.

876
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,028
我也是
So am I.

877
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,511
去吧，去找他，去向他道歉
Go ahead. Go after him, go apologize to him,

878
01:11:26,511 --> 01:11:28,827
去跟他说他才是特别的
go tell him just how special he really is.

879
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,745
- 别这样！  - 哪样了？
- Stop acting like that! - Like what?

880
01:11:30,829 --> 01:11:32,151
好像你没受伤一样
Like nothing ever hurts you.

881
01:11:32,151 --> 01:11:34,494
嗯，也许你应该想清楚的
Well, maybe you should have thought about that

882
01:11:34,494 --> 01:11:35,542
在你亲我之前
before you kissed me.

883
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:36,960
是我亲你？
I kissed you?

884
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:40,380
别担心，这对我也没什么了不起
Don't worry, it wasn't that special for me either.

885
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:48,138
西蒙，真的很抱歉，我还以为你在…
I'm really sorry, Simon, but weren't you just in the...

886
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,889
我只是在找你
I was just looking for you.

887
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,309
- 你要去哪儿？  - 回家
- Where are you going? - Home.

888
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:54,227
显然我在这太久，不受欢迎了
It's clear I overstayed my welcome.

889
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:56,604
对不起，这对我也太突然了
Look, I'm sorry, okay? It wasn't like it was planned.

890
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:59,232
但就是发生了，拜托
Let me guess, it just happened. Please.

891
01:11:59,316 --> 01:12:00,984
听着，我知道你不喜欢他，但是…
Look, I know you don't like him, but...

892
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:03,236
其实我恨他
Actually, I hate the guy.

893
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:04,738
为什么？
Why?

894
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,114
我以为你不至于爱上他
I thought you were better than that.

895
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:07,949
那这又说明什么？
What's that supposed to mean?

896
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:11,369
我才是一直等你的人，不是他
I'm the one who's always been there for you, not him.

897
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:22,547
我早爱上你了
I'm in love with you.

898
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:35,977
不过显然你没有同感
And it's clear that you don't feel the same way.

899
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:39,272
- 这…  - 不
- It's... - Don't.

900
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:41,483
没什么好说了
There's nothing to say.

901
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:46,488
还有，克拉蕾
And, Clary,

902
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:48,740
他只是利用你获得圣杯
he's just using you to get the Cup.

903
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:55,997
西蒙…
Simon...

904
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:53,490
你母亲也能这么做
Your mother was the only other person who could do that.

905
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:56,409
但我之前从没这么做过
But I've never been able to do this before.

906
01:14:57,202 --> 01:15:00,663
说明封印住的不仅是你的回忆
Apparently the block wasn't just repressing your memories,

907
01:15:00,747 --> 01:15:02,624
还有你的能力
but your abilities as well.

908
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,063
- 杰斯，我…  - 别跟我说
- Jace, I... - Don't tell me.

909
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:27,815
你急需一个裸模来画画
You have a drawing emergency and you need a nude model.

910
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:30,151
- 没那个心情  - 听着！
- I'm not in the mood. - Listen!

911
01:15:30,777 --> 01:15:33,112
我知道我妈妈将圣杯藏哪儿了
I know where my mom hid the Cup.

912
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,377
克拉蕾…
Clary...

913
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,420
你看上去很不同
Wow, you look different.

914
01:15:49,504 --> 01:15:51,673
嗯，这只是我借来的
Yeah, it's just something I borrowed.

915
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:55,885
我是说，你穿得很漂亮
I mean, nice outfit. It's good.

916
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:57,804
好吧，现在我没空聊 抱歉
Yeah, I can't talk now. Sorry.

917
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,870
（西蒙，克拉蕾刚进她家）

918
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:32,755
- 克拉蕾  - 我来拿塔罗牌
- Clary. - I came for the tarot cards.

919
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:34,382
- 为什么？  - 我需要他们
- Why?          - I need them.

920
01:16:34,465 --> 01:16:36,426
你懂的，就是我妈妈画的那些？
You know, the ones that Mom painted?

921
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:38,646
我就想快点看看
I just need to look at them really quickly,

922
01:16:38,646 --> 01:16:40,346
然后就还你，我发誓
and I'll give them back, I promise.

923
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:42,348
武器别带进来
Those can't come in here.

924
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:44,517
这是和平之地
This is a peaceful house.

925
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:46,686
放那儿
Put them in there.

926
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,526
今天感觉怎么样？
How are you feeling today?

927
01:17:38,905 --> 01:17:41,199
很好，很好
Fine. Just fine.

928
01:18:07,392 --> 01:18:10,019
小伙子，走调了
Young man, that piano is out of tune.

929
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:13,064
拜托别弹了
Please don't.

930
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:26,744
小伙子
Young man.

931
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:31,624
别弹！
Stop!

932
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:44,971
那首曲
That song.

933
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:48,391
不是我的最爱
Not one of my favorites.

934
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:11,789
停下来！
Stop!

935
01:19:12,457 --> 01:19:13,750
拿来看看
Let's have a look.

936
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:04,550
快跑！
Get out!

937
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:38,322
你好，多萝西夫人
Hey, Madame Dorothea.

938
01:20:38,322 --> 01:20:39,752
有看见克拉蕾吗？
Have you seen Clary?

939
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:41,671
我刚收到短信说她在这儿
I just got a text that said she was here.

940
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:43,005
没有
No.

941
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:44,924
好吧，我只是…
Okay. Well, I'll just...

942
01:20:45,091 --> 01:20:46,509
西蒙！
Simon!

943
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:48,928
西蒙！
Simon!

944
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,013
西蒙！
Simon!

945
01:20:51,097 --> 01:20:53,099
西蒙，这不是真的她！
Simon, it's not really her!

946
01:20:54,684 --> 01:20:55,685
西蒙！
Simon!

947
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:58,104
西蒙！
Simon!

948
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:04,777
我来照顾他
I'll take care of him.

949
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:06,946
西蒙！
Simon!

950
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,906
她拿走了圣杯！
She's got the Cup!

951
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:23,921
西蒙！
Simon!

952
01:22:10,468 --> 01:22:11,636
对不起
I'm sorry.

953
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:13,429
对不起
I'm sorry.

954
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:27,026
杰斯！
Jace!

955
01:22:31,197 --> 01:22:33,199
图符不起作用
The runes aren't working.

956
01:22:39,038 --> 01:22:40,831
西蒙，跟着我
Simon, you follow me.

957
01:22:49,215 --> 01:22:50,549
把他们切碎
You cut these up.

958
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,409
不要 够了
Don't. You've done enough.

959
01:22:54,409 --> 01:22:56,472
别这样对她 这不是她的错
Don't talk to her like that. This isn't her fault.

960
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:58,432
- 不，你说的对，是你的错  - 伊莎贝尔！
- No, you're right. This is your fault. - Isabelle!

961
01:22:58,516 --> 01:23:00,393
亚力克一直都告诫你你会受伤
Alec kept telling you that you were going to get hurt.

962
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:02,288
你会让我们都受伤
You were going to get us all hurt.

963
01:23:02,288 --> 01:23:03,479
现在他却快死了
Now he's the one dying.

964
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:04,939
我们需要找到圣杯
Well, we needed to get the Mortal Cup.

965
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:06,461
但还有别的办法
But there were other ways to do it

966
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:07,984
没必要为此伤害你的挚友
than getting your best friend killed.

967
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:11,904
去找霍奇
Why don't you go get Hodge.

968
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:15,241
我从没想让亚力克这样
I never wanted anything to happen to Alec.

969
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:16,742
对不起
I'm sorry.

970
01:23:21,414 --> 01:23:24,208
我们同意一起做的，我们一个团队
We agreed to do this together. We're a team.

971
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:26,711
有了克拉蕾，我们就不是一个团队了
Since Clary got here, we haven't been a team.

972
01:23:31,424 --> 01:23:32,717
霍奇
Hodge!

973
01:23:33,259 --> 01:23:34,677
霍奇
Hodge!

974
01:23:35,553 --> 01:23:37,013
亚力克受伤了
Alec's getting worse.

975
01:23:37,096 --> 01:23:38,264
我知道
I know.

976
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:41,308
我已经叫人来了
I've already sent for someone.

977
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:44,729
你得到圣杯了吗？
Did you get the Cup?

978
01:24:08,294 --> 01:24:09,795
然后呢？
What now?

979
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,093
霍奇？
Hodge?

980
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:25,061
你根本不知道
You have no idea what it's like

981
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:27,646
克拉夫的诅咒是什么滋味
living with the Clave's curse,

982
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:30,483
不能从这儿踏出一步
unable to set so much as a foot outside,

983
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:33,819
连开窗户都害怕
afraid to even open a window.

984
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,741
克拉蕾，别太怪我
Try not to judge me too harshly, Clary.

985
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:50,169
霍奇，你要做什么？
Hodge, what have you done?

986
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:16,278
我知道你终将把圣杯给我
I always knew you would bring me the Cup.

987
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:18,114
只是时间问题而已
It was only a matter of time.

988
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:22,993
我妈妈在哪儿？
Where is she?

989
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:25,955
她很好
She's fine.

990
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:32,169
你得到了想要的，现在放她走
You got what you want. Now let her go.

991
01:25:32,253 --> 01:25:34,839
我得看看这是不是真的
I have to make sure you gave me the real one.

992
01:25:37,383 --> 01:25:39,885
每个人为了圣杯都会不择手段
Everybody wants the Cup for the wrong reason.

993
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:43,973
那你没有吗？
And you don't?

994
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:45,432
拥有它
With this Cup,

995
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:48,144
我才能净化我的血统
I can cleanse our bloodlines,

996
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:50,312
拯救我们的种族
Save our race.

997
01:25:50,396 --> 01:25:53,983
你也许不太了解人类历史
You might not know much about mundane history,

998
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:58,002
听着，当人们谈论保护种族时
but I can tell you when people start talking about preserving a race,

999
01:25:58,002 --> 01:25:59,071
从没好事发生
it never goes well.

1000
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:03,909
这就是为何我妈妈要用一生时间隐瞒你
That's why my mom spent her whole life hiding it from you.

1001
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:05,244
不
No.

1002
01:26:06,579 --> 01:26:08,581
她不是要藏圣杯
She wasn't hiding the Cup.

1003
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:10,833
她是要藏着你
She was hiding you.

1004
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:13,961
喝下去
Drink.

1005
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,921
我不会喝的
I'm not gonna drink that.

1006
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:17,423
你为什么这么害怕？
Why are you so afraid?

1007
01:26:17,548 --> 01:26:20,176
你还没出生就已经喝过它了
You've been drinking this since before you were born.

1008
01:26:20,259 --> 01:26:23,345
我在你妈妈怀孕时就给她喝过
I fed it to your mother while you were in her womb.

1009
01:26:26,015 --> 01:26:27,516
快点，克拉蕾
Come on, Clary.

1010
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,351
你现在应该猜到
You must have guessed by now.

1011
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:31,020
你所有神奇的天赋
All these amazing talents

1012
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:33,689
都是你母亲一直想要压制的
that your mother so desperately tried to suppress,

1013
01:26:33,772 --> 01:26:35,774
你觉得它从何而来？
where do you think they came from?

1014
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:39,612
你是我女儿
You're my daughter.

1015
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:43,324
我的血液流淌在你的身上
My blood runs in your veins.

1016
01:26:43,908 --> 01:26:45,284
现在…
Now...

1017
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:47,536
喝
Drink.

1018
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:52,041
快喝！
Drink!

1019
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:04,803
把它拿出来！
Take that out!

1020
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:13,020
不！
No!

1021
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:26,909
有人进入穿梭门了
Someone just went through the Portal.

1022
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,661
我去看看
I'll go check.

1023
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:04,965
抱歉
Sorry.

1024
01:29:05,049 --> 01:29:06,342
我有点太激动了
I got a bit carried away.

1025
01:29:06,425 --> 01:29:07,634
卢克，你是…
Luke, you're a...

1026
01:29:07,718 --> 01:29:10,304
克拉蕾，听我说，听着 别害怕
Clary, listen to me, listen. Don't be afraid.

1027
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:11,722
- 听着，好吗？  - 别碰我！
- Listen, right? - Don't touch me!

1028
01:29:11,805 --> 01:29:14,308
嘿，别这样
Hey, there's no need for that.

1029
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:16,268
那东西还会回来
That thing will be back.

1030
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:19,229
这儿不安全
We are not safe out here.

1031
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:24,693
我跳进穿梭门，为了躲瓦伦丁
I jumped through the Portal to get away from Valentine.

1032
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:27,029
我以为会到我妈妈那儿
I thought I'd end up with my mom.

1033
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:34,203
但是我却到了最不想来的地方
Instead, I ended up in the last place I wanted to be.

1034
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:37,122
听着，穿梭门带你来
Listen, the Portal brought you here

1035
01:29:37,206 --> 01:29:39,375
说明你一定想到我了
because you must have been thinking of me.

1036
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,377
你内心深处仍信任我
Deep inside, you know you can trust me.

1037
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:42,731
你说过一点都不在乎
You said you couldn't care

1038
01:29:42,731 --> 01:29:44,380
我们发生什么事情
less what happened to either of us.

1039
01:29:44,463 --> 01:29:46,090
你跟别人一样，只是想要圣杯
You just want the Cup, like everyone else.

1040
01:29:46,173 --> 01:29:48,133
我说过要保护你，我还能怎么做？
I said that to protect you. What else could I do?

1041
01:29:48,217 --> 01:29:50,511
这次我得一直照看你
Been keeping an eye on you this whole time.

1042
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:00,229
在旅店那儿的是你
That was you at the hotel.

1043
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:04,066
话说投的好啊
Good throw, by the way.

1044
01:30:08,862 --> 01:30:10,030
我怎么办？
What about me?

1045
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:11,490
你怎么办？
What about you?

1046
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:12,866
我们说好的
We had a deal.

1047
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:15,327
我仍然没得到圣杯，不是吗？
Well, I still don't have my Cup, do I?

1048
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:23,252
我一直信守诺言
I held up my end of the bargain.

1049
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:26,588
不，你没有
No, you didn't.

1050
01:30:26,672 --> 01:30:28,757
我把圣杯给你了
I gave you the Cup.

1051
01:30:28,841 --> 01:30:31,343
是你给克拉蕾的 不是我的错
You handed it to Clary. That's not my fault.

1052
01:30:31,427 --> 01:30:32,553
帮我解咒
Now lift it.

1053
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:37,516
听着，这都是你脑子想的
Listen, it's all in your head.

1054
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:39,351
不，不！
No. No!

1055
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:43,897
有诅咒
There's a spell.

1056
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:46,024
真的？诅咒？
Really? A spell?

1057
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:49,027
这只是问题的借口
That's just an excuse for a real problem

1058
01:30:49,445 --> 01:30:50,696
在这儿
in there.

1059
01:30:52,156 --> 01:30:54,324
你以为我真的可以解决吗？
Do you really think I can fix that?

1060
01:30:54,408 --> 01:30:56,952
我给你圣杯了，你帮我带走恐惧
I give you the Cup, you take away the fear.

1061
01:31:01,707 --> 01:31:03,750
没有圣杯我也一样寸步难行
Without the Cup, I'm as stuck as you are.

1062
01:31:04,835 --> 01:31:06,712
我的恐惧才是真的
Except my fear is real.

1063
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:08,672
每个地下生物
Every Downworlder,

1064
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:10,507
每个守护者
every member of the Clave,

1065
01:31:10,591 --> 01:31:13,302
每个暗影猎人都在穿梭门另一侧
every Shadowhunter on both sides of the Portal

1066
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:15,137
找我
is looking for me right now.

1067
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:17,514
我才需要一切帮助
I'm going to need all the help I can get.

1068
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:21,101
瓦伦丁，你不必这样的
You don't have to go through with this, Valentine.

1069
01:31:21,685 --> 01:31:24,188
邪灵从来没到过神院
A demon has never set foot in the Institute.

1070
01:31:25,898 --> 01:31:27,274
现在是时候让他们来了
Well, maybe it's time they did.

1071
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:34,323
我等这等好多年了
I've been waiting all these years to do this.

1072
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:38,327
我别无选择
Clary's given me no choice.

1073
01:31:41,622 --> 01:31:43,123
她会回来的
She'll come back.

1074
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,043
真的吗？
Really?

1075
01:31:46,919 --> 01:31:48,420
你敢确定？
And what makes you so sure?

1076
01:31:48,504 --> 01:31:51,423
这儿有她需要的人，像她需要她妈妈一样
There's someone here she wants as much as her mother.

1077
01:31:51,924 --> 01:31:54,069
你可以骗他们
If you lie and tell them

1078
01:31:54,069 --> 01:31:56,386
说他们都是你的孩子
they're both your children,

1079
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:58,597
你这样就能让他们心碎
you'll break their hearts.

1080
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:00,265
那又怎么样？
What can I say?

1081
01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:02,643
心碎的人最听话
The broken make the best followers.

1082
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:04,728
看看你
Look at you.

1083
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:08,106
爱就是灭亡
To love is to destroy.

1084
01:33:04,246 --> 01:33:05,747
霍奇到底在哪里？
Where the hell is Hodge?

1085
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:07,541
我们没多少时间了
We don't have much time.

1086
01:33:09,585 --> 01:33:11,795
- 这弄对了吗？  - 不
- Does this look right to you? - No.

1087
01:33:14,673 --> 01:33:15,674
快看
Hey, look.

1088
01:33:18,594 --> 01:33:20,012
马格努斯？
Magnus?

1089
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:25,350
我需要这些，要很多
I'm going to need all of this. Lots of it.

1090
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:28,854
拿着
Take this.

1091
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:04,222
封锁此地
Lock this place down.

1092
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:07,976
杀死一切异族
Those who are not allies must be killed.

1093
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:24,993
别动 它们
Don't do that!

1094
01:34:26,662 --> 01:34:27,996
瓦伦丁
Valentine.

1095
01:34:28,747 --> 01:34:29,998
乔纳森
Jonathan.

1096
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:33,710
你怎么知道我的真名？
How do you know my real name?

1097
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:36,213
没人这样叫过我
Nobody calls me that.

1098
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:38,674
是真的吗？
Is it true?

1099
01:34:40,008 --> 01:34:41,927
瓦伦丁是我父亲？
Is Valentine my father?

1100
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:50,519
他曾是个好人
You know, he was a great man,

1101
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:52,104
在和守护者冲突之前
until his conflict with the Clave.

1102
01:34:52,646 --> 01:34:54,356
但你妈妈偷走圣杯后
But when your mother ran away with the Cup,

1103
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:57,609
他害怕遭守护者惩罚
he was just so afraid of retribution from the Clave,

1104
01:34:57,693 --> 01:34:59,945
他烧毁了住处
he burned their house down to the ground.

1105
01:35:02,489 --> 01:35:05,409
他要世人相信他死了
He wanted the world to believe he was dead.

1106
01:35:06,702 --> 01:35:09,538
我们在灰烬里找到一个男人
In the ashes, we found the remains of a man

1107
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:11,707
和小孩
and a child.

1108
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:13,458
等等，一个小孩？
Wait a second, there was a child?

1109
01:35:13,542 --> 01:35:15,627
瓦伦丁怒火中烧
Valentine was so enraged, he wanted her to believe

1110
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:18,213
他想要她相信他和他儿子都死了
he killed himself and their son,

1111
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:20,382
你的哥哥
your brother.

1112
01:35:21,258 --> 01:35:22,884
我有个哥哥？
I have a brother?

1113
01:35:28,181 --> 01:35:30,016
乔纳森·克里斯托弗·摩根斯坦
Jonathan Christopher Morgenstern.

1114
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:32,644
你撒谎
You're lying.

1115
01:35:33,562 --> 01:35:35,522
我姓名是杰斯·维兰德
My name is Jace Wayland.

1116
01:35:36,481 --> 01:35:38,150
我是维兰德家族的
And my family are the Waylands.

1117
01:35:39,735 --> 01:35:43,321
你以为只有克拉蕾被封存了记忆吗？
You think Clary is the only one with a block in her mind?

1118
01:35:44,448 --> 01:35:46,241
让你看看什么是真相
Let me show you the truth.

1119
01:35:51,413 --> 01:35:53,415
你没有驯服它，你毁了它
You didn't tame him. You broke him.

1120
01:35:54,082 --> 01:35:55,751
不！你…
No! You...

1121
01:35:57,461 --> 01:35:59,463
你不是我父亲
You are not my father.

1122
01:36:00,839 --> 01:36:04,259
我来是要让你知道自己到底是谁
I came back to help you understand who you really are.

1123
01:36:06,136 --> 01:36:07,512
我懂你在这不开心
I know you're unhappy here.

1124
01:36:07,804 --> 01:36:09,431
要守很多规矩
Plagued by rules.

1125
01:36:11,057 --> 01:36:15,353
你的名字辈分仅次于我
Your place is next to me.

1126
01:36:16,313 --> 01:36:18,106
你是摩根斯坦家族一员
You're a Morgenstern.

1127
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:20,859
你是我儿子
And you're my son.

1128
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:35,707
我叫杰斯·维兰德
My name is Jace Wayland.

1129
01:36:39,044 --> 01:36:40,545
我是维兰德家族的
I'm a Wayland.

1130
01:36:41,588 --> 01:36:43,298
抱歉告诉你这个消息
Sorry to break this to you,

1131
01:36:43,381 --> 01:36:45,675
但也是时候该知道了
but it's time you heard the truth.

1132
01:36:45,926 --> 01:36:46,927
不
Don't.

1133
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:52,432
只是理解方式的问题
It's all a matter of perception.

1134
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:57,062
看到了吗？摩根斯坦
You see, Morgenstern.

1135
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,377
- 拿着  - 好
- Take this. - Okay.

1136
01:37:20,836 --> 01:37:21,920
好
Okay.

1137
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:34,641
伊莎贝尔
Isabelle.

1138
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:53,743
克拉蕾？
Clary?

1139
01:37:53,827 --> 01:37:54,995
我们找到你妈妈了
Yeah, we found your mom.

1140
01:37:55,328 --> 01:37:56,496
他们找到她了
They found her.

1141
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:58,456
在神院
She's at the Institute.

1142
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,044
阿拉里克
Alaric.

1143
01:38:03,128 --> 01:38:05,005
我是卢克，你看到了吗？
It's Luke. Can you see it?

1144
01:38:05,505 --> 01:38:06,590
是的，我看到了
Yeah, I see it.

1145
01:38:09,092 --> 01:38:10,218
兄弟们，得走了
Hey, guys, we have to go.

1146
01:38:10,302 --> 01:38:11,803
卢克需要咱们
Luke needs us.

1147
01:38:11,887 --> 01:38:13,430
我们去哪？
Where are we headed?

1148
01:38:13,513 --> 01:38:14,556
神院
The Institute.

1149
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:16,391
我们这是在破坏协议
We'd be breaking the accords.

1150
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:18,268
不变身就没关系
Not if we stay human.

1151
01:38:19,019 --> 01:38:20,228
走，兄弟们！
Let's go, guys!

1152
01:38:20,312 --> 01:38:21,605
快走，快走！
Go, go, go, go!

1153
01:38:21,688 --> 01:38:22,939
快，动起来！
Come on, move it!

1154
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:33,366
准备就绪！
Ready to go!

1155
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:34,492
一切听指挥
They've all been briefed.

1156
01:38:34,576 --> 01:38:36,870
他是阿拉里克，我们的人
This is Alaric. He's one of us.

1157
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:42,918
走吧
Go ahead.

1158
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:45,670
如果需要可以将头伸出窗外
You can hang your head out the window if you need to.

1159
01:38:45,754 --> 01:38:47,672
我是狼人
I'm a werewolf

1160
01:38:47,756 --> 01:38:49,674
不是金毛犬
not a golden retriever.

1161
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:55,847
西蒙！
Simon!

1162
01:38:59,017 --> 01:38:59,976
在这等，我会回来
Just wait here, I'll be back.

1163
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:02,270
啥？不 伊莎贝尔，我不能…
What? No. Isabelle, I can't just...

1164
01:39:02,354 --> 01:39:04,022
不，伊莎贝尔！
No. Isabelle!

1165
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:10,028
回来，伊莎贝尔，你去哪？
Come on, Isabelle, where are you?

1166
01:39:14,658 --> 01:39:16,451
好，上！
All right, move it!

1167
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:18,203
快点，上！
Come on, move it!

1168
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:26,628
好吧
All right.

1169
01:39:26,711 --> 01:39:29,214
狼人来救我们了
The werewolves are here to save us.

1170
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:31,675
难以置信我这么说
Never thought I'd say that.

1171
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:38,932
伊莎贝尔
Finally! Isabelle.

1172
01:39:40,934 --> 01:39:42,811
打开
Hey, open up the door.

1173
01:40:13,258 --> 01:40:15,010
起作用了
It looks like he's responding.

1174
01:40:15,093 --> 01:40:16,594
他能挺过来
He'll survive.

1175
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:22,058
小心
And be careful.

1176
01:40:24,269 --> 01:40:26,104
有人入侵
You're being invaded.

1177
01:40:31,693 --> 01:40:33,945
召集所有邪灵…
Summoning all these bloody demons...

1178
01:41:04,642 --> 01:41:05,643
跑！
Run!

1179
01:41:14,194 --> 01:41:15,320
快跑！
Run!

1180
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:18,323
- 走哪里？  - 那有另一个出口！
- Where are we going? - There's another exit!

1181
01:41:19,324 --> 01:41:20,867
等等
Wait.

1182
01:41:34,672 --> 01:41:36,091
伊莎贝尔！
Isabelle!

1183
01:41:37,092 --> 01:41:39,177
- 我差点杀死你了  - 是啊
- I almost killed you. - Yeah.

1184
01:41:40,178 --> 01:41:41,346
你还好吗？
You okay?

1185
01:41:41,429 --> 01:41:43,389
- 没事，我没事  - 来吧
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. - Come on.

1186
01:41:43,473 --> 01:41:44,766
这破地方全是邪灵
This place is full of demons.

1187
01:41:44,849 --> 01:41:46,518
这不可能
That's impossible.

1188
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:48,228
神院是圣地
The Institute is hallowed ground.

1189
01:41:48,311 --> 01:41:50,772
他们还不知情
Yeah, no one seems to have told them that.

1190
01:41:50,855 --> 01:41:53,191
肯定有内鬼放他们进来
Someone on the inside must have let them in.

1191
01:42:00,657 --> 01:42:02,075
原是救援行动
This is a rescue mission.

1192
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:04,244
我们可没装备作战
We are not equipped to fight demons.

1193
01:42:15,672 --> 01:42:17,423
- 分开！  - 这边！这边！
- Spread out! - That way! That way!

1194
01:42:19,634 --> 01:42:20,844
后退！快！
Move back! Come on!

1195
01:42:36,609 --> 01:42:38,236
阿拉里克，我们需要支援！
We could use some help here, Alaric!

1196
01:42:40,321 --> 01:42:41,906
阿拉里克！
Alaric!

1197
01:42:44,576 --> 01:42:46,578
振作点，这肯定还有别的出入，是吧？
Come on, there must be some other way out of here, right?

1198
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:47,871
不，这里没有，西蒙！
No, there isn't, Simon!

1199
01:42:47,954 --> 01:42:49,122
我们撑不了多久！
We can't hold them much longer!

1200
01:43:38,463 --> 01:43:39,464
让开
Step away.

1201
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:42,800
让开！
Step away!

1202
01:44:12,789 --> 01:44:15,750
克拉蕾，这是什么图符？
Clary, which rune is that?

1203
01:44:16,918 --> 01:44:17,919
我也不知道，它是…
I don't know, it's just...

1204
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,754
- 我从没见过  - 真的吗？
- I've never seen it before. - Really?

1205
01:44:19,837 --> 01:44:21,172
不在书上
It's not in the book.

1206
01:44:24,842 --> 01:44:26,261
它在消退
It's fading.

1207
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:50,451
肯定有地方放他们进来
Here, they're coming in through somewhere.

1208
01:44:50,535 --> 01:44:52,412
我得去阻止他们
I'm going to stop them.

1209
01:44:56,249 --> 01:44:57,500
快点
Come on.

1210
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:58,751
你们现走
You guys go.

1211
01:44:58,918 --> 01:45:00,461
我们垫后
We'll catch up.

1212
01:45:27,822 --> 01:45:29,157
不！
No!

1213
01:45:48,426 --> 01:45:50,428
他们从屋顶下来的，跟上
They're coming from the dome. Come on.

1214
01:46:03,107 --> 01:46:04,442
乔丝琳
Jocelyn,

1215
01:46:05,485 --> 01:46:07,445
我一直惦记你
you never left my heart.

1216
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:09,947
我现在带你回家
I've come to take you home.

1217
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:14,535
她哪儿也不去
She's not going anywhere.

1218
01:46:16,537 --> 01:46:18,498
你怎么上来的
How did you get up here?

1219
01:46:23,878 --> 01:46:26,297
你比我想象的更强大
You're even more powerful than I anticipated.

1220
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:28,299
离她远点
Get away from her.

1221
01:46:33,971 --> 01:46:35,223
干嘛？
What the hell?

1222
01:46:35,306 --> 01:46:37,100
听他说
Just listen to what he has to say.

1223
01:46:38,726 --> 01:46:40,686
不是你想的那样
It's not what you think.

1224
01:46:43,606 --> 01:46:44,941
终于…
Finally...

1225
01:46:46,651 --> 01:46:48,820
我的两个孩子团聚了
Both my children together.

1226
01:46:48,903 --> 01:46:51,239
我女儿
My daughter

1227
01:46:51,322 --> 01:46:52,698
和我儿子
and my son.

1228
01:46:54,283 --> 01:46:56,035
对不起，克拉蕾
I'm so sorry, Clary.

1229
01:46:57,870 --> 01:46:59,372
我原先不知道
I didn't know.

1230
01:47:00,832 --> 01:47:02,500
瓦伦丁在撒谎
Valentine's lying.

1231
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:04,585
你是迈克尔·维兰德的儿子
You're Michael Wayland's son.

1232
01:47:04,669 --> 01:47:06,128
卢克说我哥哥已经死了
Luke said my brother is dead.

1233
01:47:06,128 --> 01:47:07,004
他死于火灾
He died in a fire,

1234
01:47:07,088 --> 01:47:09,173
他们在灰烬里找到他遗骸
and they found his remains in the ashes.

1235
01:47:09,257 --> 01:47:11,426
我带乔纳森一起逃跑的
I took Jonathan with me when I ran.

1236
01:47:11,676 --> 01:47:14,303
那孩子遗骨是狼人所为
The bones were of a child killed by wolves.

1237
01:47:17,181 --> 01:47:19,058
但愿这不是真的
I wish it wasn't true.

1238
01:47:22,019 --> 01:47:24,439
她不愿意相信
She doesn't want to believe you

1239
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:29,277
因为她爱上你了，乔纳森
because she is in love with you, Jonathan.

1240
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,654
我以为你叫杰斯
I thought your name was Jace.

1241
01:47:33,114 --> 01:47:34,866
杰斯是小名
Jace is a nickname.

1242
01:47:39,704 --> 01:47:41,581
乔纳森·克里斯托弗…
Jonathan Christopher...

1243
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:45,334
J.C.

1244
01:47:48,254 --> 01:47:49,589
杰斯
Jace.

1245
01:48:27,502 --> 01:48:28,753
把手在这
There's the lever.

1246
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:30,838
你进去，我阻止他们
You go close the dome and I'll hold them off.

1247
01:48:39,597 --> 01:48:41,599
把圣杯拿出来，克拉蕾
Take out the Cup, Clary.

1248
01:48:46,312 --> 01:48:47,647
拿出圣杯！
Take out my Cup!

1249
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:49,232
我要你拿！
I want that Cup!

1250
01:48:49,315 --> 01:48:50,942
你说过不伤害她！
You said you wouldn't hurt her!

1251
01:48:53,194 --> 01:48:54,195
够了！
Enough!

1252
01:49:00,868 --> 01:49:02,036
说够了
That's enough.

1253
01:49:03,788 --> 01:49:04,872
现在！
Now!

1254
01:49:10,378 --> 01:49:11,504
卡住了！
It's stuck!

1255
01:49:11,587 --> 01:49:12,797
关掉它！
Close it!

1256
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:14,298
不行！
I can't!

1257
01:49:15,132 --> 01:49:16,968
好像少了一块！
I think there's a piece missing!

1258
01:49:23,724 --> 01:49:24,725
克拉蕾！
Clary!

1259
01:49:44,787 --> 01:49:46,372
我非常需要它
I really need this.

1260
01:50:10,021 --> 01:50:11,188
妈妈？
Mom?

1261
01:51:07,745 --> 01:51:09,914
- 去找其他人  - 好
- Find the others. - All right.

1262
01:51:11,165 --> 01:51:15,044
好吧，你是要上还是下呢？
All right, you want to take the upstairs or the down?

1263
01:51:17,088 --> 01:51:19,715
我对底下不感冒
I'm not too crazy about the basement.

1264
01:51:25,846 --> 01:51:28,140
我撑不了太久！
I can't hold them back any longer!

1265
01:51:30,434 --> 01:51:31,936
西蒙，快点！
Simon, hurry!

1266
01:51:41,737 --> 01:51:43,364
克拉蕾！
Clary!

1267
01:51:50,287 --> 01:51:52,498
嗨，卢克先生
Hello, Mr. Garroway.

1268
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:55,960
看起来今天你很悲剧，嗯？
Looks like you're having a rough day, eh?

1269
01:51:56,794 --> 01:52:01,424
我觉得这种情况下直接杀了你
I guess the humane thing to do in this situation

1270
01:52:01,507 --> 01:52:03,592
会仁慈点
would be to put you down.

1271
01:52:03,968 --> 01:52:05,761
你想看我变身吗？
But you wanted to see me change.

1272
01:52:06,137 --> 01:52:07,138
是的
I do.

1273
01:52:17,356 --> 01:52:18,566
起来！
Get up!

1274
01:52:20,067 --> 01:52:22,903
那么，你到底要反抗到什么时候？
So, boy, how far do you want to take this?

1275
01:52:25,406 --> 01:52:26,866
到死为止
To the end.

1276
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:51,140
西蒙！
Simon!

1277
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:29,845
伊莎贝尔！
Isabelle!

1278
01:53:38,854 --> 01:53:40,064
靠着我
Lean on me.

1279
01:53:57,665 --> 01:53:59,667
出去！快！
Get out! Go on!

1280
01:54:00,084 --> 01:54:01,335
离开这儿
Get out of here.

1281
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:05,589
快跑！
Come on!

1282
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:10,052
走！
Go!

1283
01:54:15,349 --> 01:54:17,351
听说你喜欢弹琴
Somebody told me that you like to play music.

1284
01:54:20,688 --> 01:54:22,398
歌德会为此骄傲的
Johann would be very proud.

1285
01:54:32,867 --> 01:54:35,411
你该死在拉齐尔剑下
Now you shall die by Raziel's sword.

1286
01:54:36,412 --> 01:54:37,621
住手！
Stop!

1287
01:54:38,581 --> 01:54:39,665
要么我就丢了它！
Or I'll drop it!

1288
01:54:40,457 --> 01:54:41,667
你不会那么做的
You don't want to do that.

1289
01:54:42,293 --> 01:54:43,627
克拉蕾，别给他
Don't give it to him, Clary.

1290
01:54:51,176 --> 01:54:53,304
你先听我说
I need you to listen to me.

1291
01:54:54,388 --> 01:54:55,639
我是你爸爸
As your father,

1292
01:54:55,723 --> 01:54:57,349
我求你了
I'm begging you.

1293
01:55:03,272 --> 01:55:05,107
要是我爸爸就一定懂我
If you'd been a real dad,

1294
01:55:05,190 --> 01:55:07,818
懂得圣杯在哪里
you'd know me well enough to imagine where the Cup is,

1295
01:55:07,902 --> 01:55:10,529
知道我心底想的地方
where my deepest thoughts are taking it.

1296
01:55:11,822 --> 01:55:14,617
你一点都不懂我
You don't know the first thing about me.

1297
01:55:15,534 --> 01:55:17,328
你不是我爸…
You're not my dad...

1298
01:55:18,704 --> 01:55:20,539
永远不是
And you never will be.

1299
01:55:20,623 --> 01:55:22,875
我保证你不会再见到我
I promise, you'll never have to see me again.

1300
01:55:29,423 --> 01:55:30,633
克拉蕾，谢谢
Thank you, Clary.

1301
01:55:35,262 --> 01:55:38,307
没有圣杯，我们会输的
Without this Cup, we are lost.

1302
01:55:39,266 --> 01:55:40,517
不是“我们”
Not "we."

1303
01:55:42,811 --> 01:55:43,854
是你
You.

1304
01:56:08,796 --> 01:56:09,964
克拉蕾！
Clary!

1305
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:15,177
- 不！抓住我！  - 决不！
- No! Don't let go! - Never!

1306
01:56:18,305 --> 01:56:19,390
这儿！
Here!

1307
01:57:18,323 --> 01:57:19,783
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

1308
01:57:20,617 --> 01:57:22,119
我不知道
I don't know.

1309
01:58:01,784 --> 01:58:04,411
我知道你之前为什么那样做了
I understand why you did what you did.

1310
01:58:06,663 --> 01:58:08,332
我原谅你
And I forgive you.

1311
01:58:09,708 --> 01:58:11,668
我要你知道
I want you to know,

1312
01:58:13,754 --> 01:58:15,881
我会为你保密
your secret's safe with me.

1313
01:59:09,643 --> 01:59:12,187
她怎么样了？
So, how's she doing?

1314
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:14,064
情况稳定了
Stable.

1315
01:59:14,731 --> 01:59:16,775
医生不知道她喝过什么
The doctors don't know what she took,

1316
01:59:16,859 --> 01:59:19,069
只能等
so we just have to wait.

1317
01:59:22,739 --> 01:59:24,491
对不起
I'm sorry.

1318
01:59:24,575 --> 01:59:26,535
我觉得我只是一个老古董
I guess I'm an old romantic.

1319
01:59:26,618 --> 01:59:28,829
我总希望当我向某人说
I always hoped that when I finally said

1320
01:59:28,912 --> 01:59:32,082
“我爱你”时，她会说同样的话
"I love you" to someone, she'd say the same thing back.

1321
01:59:32,541 --> 01:59:34,334
那个人会的
And that someone will.

1322
01:59:34,418 --> 01:59:35,752
但愿吧
Yeah, I know.

1323
01:59:44,928 --> 01:59:46,597
你很累了
Hey, you're tired.

1324
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:49,099
去休息吧，我们会照看好她
Go sleep, we'll take care of her.

1325
01:59:50,267 --> 01:59:51,768
好，抱一个
Yeah, come on.

1326
02:00:43,237 --> 02:00:45,280
我喜欢你收拾这里
I like what you've done with the place.

1327
02:00:45,364 --> 02:00:47,824
我只是耍了些把戏
I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.

1328
02:00:49,618 --> 02:00:51,787
克拉蕾，我们真怕你不会回来了
Clary, we're afraid you're not coming back.

1329
02:00:53,330 --> 02:00:54,915
只是现在跟你作伴真的很难
It's just really hard to be around you right now.

1330
02:00:54,998 --> 02:00:57,000
对我来说也一样
It's hard for me as well.

1331
02:00:58,335 --> 02:01:00,671
但是这不仅仅是我们
But this is about more than us.

1332
02:01:01,964 --> 02:01:04,883
你有不可思议的天赋，我们需要你
You have an incredible gift, and we need you.

1333
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:09,346
我需要你
I need you.

1334
02:01:10,514 --> 02:01:12,182
我不知道
I just don't know.

1335
02:01:12,849 --> 02:01:15,018
还记得我说过从没见过天使？
Remember when I said I'd never seen an angel?

1336
02:01:19,231 --> 02:01:20,691
我撒谎了
Well, I lied.

1337
02:01:30,242 --> 02:01:32,244
你是我见过最勇敢的凡人
You're still the bravest mundane I've ever met.

1338
02:01:36,707 --> 02:01:38,375
我可不是凡人
I'm not a mundane.

1339
02:01:41,003 --> 02:01:42,170
等等，杰斯！
Wait, Jace!

1340
02:01:46,508 --> 02:01:47,759
慢慢来啊
You took your time.

1341
02:01:54,725 --> 02:01:56,643
你说过你需要我
You said you needed me.

1342
02:02:01,606 --> 02:02:03,066
你该好好保存它
You should keep that safe.

1343
02:02:03,150 --> 02:02:04,276
我会的
Yeah.

1344
02:02:05,902 --> 02:02:07,612
我可以抱着你吗…
Is it okay if I...

1345
02:02:08,572 --> 02:02:09,990
我能…
Do I...

1346
02:02:10,073 --> 02:02:12,242
- 这样可以吗…  - 没关系
- Is it okay if I... - Yeah.

1347
02:02:15,495 --> 02:02:17,748
听着，克拉蕾，我不相信它
Look, Clary, I don't believe it.

1348
02:02:17,831 --> 02:02:19,541
这似乎不是真的，不在我的心里
It doesn't feel like the truth, not in my heart.

1349
02:02:21,168 --> 02:02:24,254
我只是不懂如何去面对这个世界
I just don't know how to look at the world anymore.

1350
02:02:24,338 --> 02:02:27,132
我看不到街道，红绿灯和车
I don't see streets and traffic lights and cars.

1351
02:02:27,215 --> 02:02:29,176
眼前只是邪灵和天使
I see demons and angels.

1352
02:02:30,135 --> 02:02:31,136
一切都变了
Everything's different.

1353
02:02:31,219 --> 02:02:33,013
世界还是一样的
The world's the same.

1354
02:02:33,930 --> 02:02:36,224
你才是变了的那个
You're the one who's different.

1355
02:02:42,439 --> 02:02:44,066
你还记得霍奇说的吗？
Don't you remember what Hodge said?

1356
02:02:44,149 --> 02:02:45,359
什么？
What?

1357
02:02:45,442 --> 02:02:47,110
所以故事都是真的
All the stories are true.

1358
02:03:00,587 --> 02:03:03,158
感谢观影
