1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,900
previously onwhite collar...

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,250
the mosconi codex.

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,580
you're gonna steal it for me.

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,440
when does it end?

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,080
you left him bleeding on the sidewalk.

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:08,950
I didn't kill the dude.

7
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,440
I pulled that badge and gun
out of the trash,I swear.

8
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,970
summers told us where she hid the
$2 million,but it wasn't there.

9
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,400
a chiropractor's office?

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,120
it'll look the part.agent
gruetzner.we've been expecting you.

11
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,760
any reason he'd slip away to come here?

12
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,140
neal always has a reason.

13
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,900
if this book is a puzzle,maybe
these are the pieces.

14
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,300
this stained glass window could
be right here in manhattan.

15
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,570
this is where neal was standing.

16
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,630
for 20 minutes,after which he went
straight home,according to his anklet.

17
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,270
from this intersection,you could
scout a museum,two banks,and a gallery,

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,510
not to mention all the
residential targets.

19
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,560
peter,I made some calls.There was
no suspicious activity reported.

20
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,700
not unless you count
neal caffrey being here.

21
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,830
you think I'm overreacting?

22
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,600
no,I just think we might
consider the possibility

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,820
that caffrey was just
picking up some groceries.

24
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,200
long walk for a loaf of bread.

25
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,210
okay.

26
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,890
so what was he doing there?

27
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,240
first,there was the missing cash,then
the fbi pen at the chiropractor's office,

28
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,460
and now this street corner.

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,210
so what do you think it all adds up to?

30
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,220
that's the problem.

31
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,490
I can't see how it all connects.

32
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,810
I'm missing something.

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,470
- See if any cameras in the area picked up anything.
- will do.

34
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,380
listen,I also ran the card that
you found in siegel's badge.

35
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,050
talked to the real estate company.no
one knew what "cooper 3?" meant.

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,800
I looked through siegel's old case
files,friends and family back in chicago.

37
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,410
hell,I even looked on google.

38
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,660
no hits.sorry.

39
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,450
listen,I hate to ask you this,

40
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,960
but you don't think caffrey knows
anything that he's not telling us,do you?

41
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,250
- about siegel?
- yeah.

42
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,960
- I don't.
- all right.

43
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,280
- checked black market code
words,drop locations,c.i.Names.

44
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,730
mozzie even tried to tie
it to d.b. Cooper.nothing.

45
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,490
- maybe it's an fbi
agent grasping at straws.

46
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,200
we both know your
instincts are rarely wrong.

47
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,110
- well,for now,we've got a stolen
shipping crate that demands our attention.

48
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,980
grabbed from canadian customs this
morning by a fraudulent trucking company.

49
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,510
the driver ran.no sign of him yet.

50
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,970
- must be some exotic canadian
contraband to get you out of the office.

51
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,430
- oh,this is well worth
a stretch of my legs.

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,700
don't tell me.it's diamonds from the
diavik mine in the northwest territories.

53
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,280
maybe it's maple syrup.

54
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,970
- you joke,but the great canadian
maple syrup heist was worth 18 million.

55
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,710
you'd need a bigger crate though.

56
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,310
- and a lot of pancakes.

57
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,910
special agent burke.go ahead.

58
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,300
- It's like christmas morning.
- no,it's not a gift.

59
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,160
this is stolen property.I know
the line gets blurry for you.

60
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,760
- Based on the size of the
box and the country of origin,

61
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,530
my best guess is a sculpture from
emanuel hahn,canadian artist,circa 1918.

62
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,330
- oh,this is better than christmas.

63
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,950
this is a dinosaur egg.

64
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,590
Even now you kind of expect
it to crack open,don't you?

65
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,560
- I really don't.

66
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,160
- a fossilized egg doesn't
capture your imagination?

67
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,780
- well,the value of it does.

68
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,200
- hello?excuse me.I'm Dr.Khatri.

69
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,510
I'm one of the curators of
the natural history museum.

70
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,710
- agent peter burke.

71
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,370
- you're the one who found my egg.

72
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,920
- well,he can't take all the credit.

73
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,410
- and where's the mother?

74
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,670
- what do you mean?

75
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,800
- there was a second shipment
containing the mother.

76
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,070
- what kind of mother?

77
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,710
- a tyrannosaurus rex.

78
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,200
- you're saying there's a tyrannosaurus
rex lost somewhere in new york city?

79
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,860

color=#238E68>white.collar.s05e08</font>

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,970
- tyrannosaurus rex was being shipped
simultaneously on a different truck.

83
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,030
no sign of it anywhere.hunting a t-rex.

84
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,690
seven-year-old me
would be going crazy.

85
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,690
- adult you isn't exactly serene.

86
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,140
- I can't wait to see it in person
when it's reunited with its egg.

87
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,600
- mozzie used to create fake
fossils and bury them at dig sites.

88
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,720
- used to?

89
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,380
- it's been a couple months.

90
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,920
- the alternate history of
the earth according to mozzie.

91
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,140
that's terrifying.

92
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,740
- I'm just saying,the black market
is rife with fake fossils like this.

93
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,440
do we know the egg is real?

94
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,150
- khatri ran an acid
test and authenticated it.

95
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,910
- well,people with way too much money

96
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,390
and no subtlety do love to put them
in their office as a display of power.

97
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,150
- yeah,what bigger display than a t
-rex and its egg?

98
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,400
whoever the buyer is,it's
clear they want the entire set.

99
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,060
- valuable alone,invaluable together.

100
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,460
it's like having queen mary's diamond
riviere without the la peregrina pearl.

101
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,030
jones is working on a list
of suspects.I gotta get home.

102
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,310
what are your plans tonight?

103
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,520
- I'm just gonna relax at home.

104
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,390
do a little light reading.

105
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,570
- I'm really happy that you called.

106
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,400
I found something,and
I brought something.

107
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,550
- yeah,I should've mentioned...agent
gruetzner will be joing us.

108
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,990
- hello.
- a rare book expert and a wine connoisseur.

109
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,930
california zin.

110
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,270
well,there's no shame
in having one specialty.

111
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,950
- you said you found something?

112
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,030
- uh,yes.yes,I did.

113
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,220
so I was looking into the stained
glass window,and I stumbled across this.

114
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,360
mosconi's grave site.

115
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,620
- uh,yes.just look
down here at the bottom.

116
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,810
- it's a masonic compass.

117
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,960
so he was a mason.

118
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,840
- I should have noticed it sooner.

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,760
I mean,this is why he put
the chapter 13 into the codex.

120
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,800
- 13 is considered a sacred
number for the brotherhood.

121
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,310
- he was sending a message
to the other masons.

122
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,180
- the codex could lead us anywhere.

123
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,750
I mean,masons have their hands in
everything.finance,government,art.

124
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,940
- untimely death.

125
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,830
look at the date on the gravestone.

126
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,300
- april 17,1887.

127
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,490
that's the same month he finished the
window.that must have been his final work.

128
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,850
do you think that he was
killed because of all of this?

129
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,430
if that's so,the stained
glass could tell us why.

130
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,690
well,thanks for everything.we'll
take it from here.

131
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,120
okay,I'll leave you to it.

132
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,730
- Yes,thank you for coming over and for the wine.
- sure.

133
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,840
- dinner on wednesday
without the chaperone?

134
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,560
- of course,agent caffrey.

135
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,220
I look forward to working
with you more on all of this.

136
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,700
- what?

137
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,560
I got it under control.

138
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,860
well,I hate to report the obvious news,

139
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,320
but the last thing you are
right now is under control.

140
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,150
luckily,you have a guardian
angel looking over you.

141
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,830
- this is less angel and more stalker.

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,930
- I vetted her,a cursory
audit.financials,education,daily schedule.

143
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,090
she keeps a tight routine,speaks three
languages,studied two years in france.

144
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,090
here,just keep it.just in case.

145
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,550
- t
-rex and her egg were owned legally by a man in toronto for 50 years.

146
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,010
he kept it in his family room
until he died three months ago.

147
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,090
- that's a hell of a
pet to get your kids.

148
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,140
- big pooper scooper.

149
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,850
- he dictated that,upon his
death,it be donated to the museum.

150
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,870
- I'm guessing someone tried to
persuade the estate to sell it instead.

151
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,880
- lots of someones.

152
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,270
- who do we like?

153
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,080
- well,there's a number of people
who pursued it very aggressively.

154
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,360
- lots of escalating offers.
- and a lot of suspicious people making them.

155
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,850
- anyone only try once?
- yeah,there were two single bids.

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,410
I mean,one was a lowball
offer,but then there's this guy.

157
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,170
he made a single high-priced
offer,then nothing.

158
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,880
brett forsythe,corporate raider,made
millions from hostile takeovers.

159
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,920
- I've heard of him.

160
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,320
He led a takeover of a
company called aegis last year.

161
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,900
that's the kind of guy who knows
when someone's not gonna sell,

162
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,840
and his only option is
to take what he wants.

163
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,630
- I'm gonna pay him a visit.

164
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,370
- I'm sorry,Mr.Forsythe is
unavailable at the moment.

165
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,930
- of course he is.

166
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,950
well,if you could tell him
that agent burke of the fbi,

167
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,290
white collar division,would
like to speak with him.

168
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,570
I can wait here as long as it takes.

169
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,890
I'm sure these guys would
love to keep me company.

170
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,940
that's probably her boss telling
her that I can see him now.

171
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,690
when you took over aegis,the board
didn't know you'd stolen their company

172
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,240
until you walked through the
door and fired all of them.

173
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,310
- that was my legal right,agent burke.

174
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,520
- it was.

175
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:04,310
and then you sold off pieces of the
company one by one,made a great profit.

176
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,680
lost a lot of jobs.

177
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,020
- The feds questioned me about
the aegis takeover a month ago.

178
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,430
it was all aboveboard.

179
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
- I know.

180
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,470
- why are you here?

181
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,340
- is that a velociraptor skull?

182
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,450
- yeah.

183
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,670
I should sell it.

184
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,150
thanks tojurassic park,everyone
thinks they're an expert on them.

185
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,170
- except the movie
got everything wrong.

186
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,630
velociraptors were
most likely feathered,

187
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,300
based on the quill knobs
found by paleontologists.

188
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,190
and the film made them much larger,more
like the size of a deinonychus.

189
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,350
- that's true.

190
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,130
velociraptors were closer
to the size of a chicken.

191
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,760
- still,one mean
-looking chicken.

192
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,650
- and very dangerous.

193
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,620
are you a collector?

194
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,670
- oh,on a government salary?

195
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,090
I'd barely be able to
afford an ankle joint.

196
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,370
how'd you get it?

197
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,080
- there are many legal ways
to purchase fossils,agent.

198
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,580
- true.many illegal ways as well.

199
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,400
- that why you're here?

200
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,050
to question the legality
of my velociraptor?

201
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,270
- no,I'm hunting something bigger.

202
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,250
a t-rex.

203
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,330
- thought you said you
weren't a collector.

204
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,880
- it's not for me.

205
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,910
it was supposed to go to a
museum but didn't make it there.

206
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:41,490
- Agent burke,even if I stole a tyrannosaurus
rex,which I did not,what would I do with it?

207
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,240
it's not like I could
just put it on display.

208
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,830
- that's a good point.

209
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,620
but what a thing to have.

210
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,440
- you think he has an actual
skeleton in his closet?

211
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,390
- I don't know what
he's hiding in there,

212
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,760
but there was a large open space
right underneath the raptor skull.

213
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,350
- well,he stalled when you got
there.that gave him time to move it.

214
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,860
so chances are it's illegal.

215
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,720
- is that what takes you so long
to come to the door when I knock?

216
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,070
- you think I'm hiding
illicit goods under my bed?

217
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,470
- I think you're hiding something.

218
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,190
but I don't have enough for a
warrant to search forsythe's office.

219
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:30,220
- you should stake it
out,see what happens.

220
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,600
especially around 6:00 p.m.

221
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,030
- I'll keep an eye out
for anything suspicious.

222
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,620
- you said the empty space
was near the raptor skull?

223
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,220
- yeah,right underneath.

224
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,040
- it's not empty anymore.

225
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,550
now there's a mean-looking club there.

226
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,820
looks pre-columbian.

227
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,620
- forsythe must have
moved it back after I left.

228
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,180
- as long as I'm here,I should
see what else he's hiding.

229
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,130
- no,get the picture,and get out.

230
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:50,810
- the trick with sliding locks is they leave
a smudge that can tell you what the code is.

231
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,920
- this does not sound
like you getting out.

232
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,110
the key is guessing where
it starts and where it ends.

233
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,520
is he right-
or left-handed?

234
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,010
- right.why?

235
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,350
- right
-handed people instinctively draw counterclockwise.

236
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,510
- I told you to get out.

237
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,370
- forsythe has a whole lab back here.

238
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,400
microscopes,test tubes,all
kinds of forensic equipment.

239
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,250
- forsythe came back.

240
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,250
- almost done.

241
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,750
- did you set off an alarm?

242
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,200
- peter,that's hurtful.

243
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,390
- either way,he's headed your way.

244
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,160
- all right,leaving now.

245
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,250
- where are you?

246
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,340
where are you?

247
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,020
- it's called a
macuahuitl.- "macua-neenle."

248
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,890
- no,"macua-heetle."
- "macua-heednum."

249
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,900
- no,"macua-heetle."
- I said that.

250
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,050
- okay,either way,your hunch is right.

251
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,690
it was stolen from a pre-columbian
exhibit here in new york.

252
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,760
- I guess forsythe does some business
in the black market after all.

253
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,100
- yeah,but get this.It
was stolen eight years ago.

254
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,040
- statute of limitations is up.

255
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,830
- forsythe's a smart guy.he
knows we can't get him on it.

256
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,990
- sure,he didn't want to raise
a red flag in front of a bull.

257
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,660
- not when he's hiding
something bigger.

258
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,590
for a job as big as a t-rex,he'd wanna use
somebody he can trust,somebody he'd used before.

259
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,850
any suspects in the macuahuitl theft？

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,500
- there were no arrests,but
there were three suspects.

261
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,440
one's in jail.one recently
questioned in prague.

262
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,320
then there's this guy,michael holt.

263
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,650
suspected in four other
robberies along the east coast.

264
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,210
- he doesn't stay in
one place very long.

265
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,840
- no,but even a master thief needs time to unload a 40
-foot prehistoric skeleton.

266
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,640
- either way,we've got a narrow window
before he leaves town.track him down.

267
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,160
- before we do,you wanna know why caffrey
was standing on that street corner?

268
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,880
- yeah,I do.

269
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,030
what do you have?

270
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,900
- not what.it's who.

271
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,610
I got this off a security
camera from across the street.

272
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,860
- she looks familiar.

273
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,840
- her name's rebecca lowe.

274
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,600
- yeah,the woman we brought in
from the gershon heist a while back.

275
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,730
what's neal doing with her?

276
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:52,120
- you know,I was talking to el,she has
a friend she'd like to set you up with.

277
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,000
- does this friend know
that I come with a rap sheet?

278
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,100
interested?

279
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,280
- tell elizabeth thank you,but
I'm not looking right now.

280
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,260
- well,it's been a while since sara,and I
thought you might wanna get back out there.

281
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,000
not that it's difficult for you.

282
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,140
- you'd be surprised.

283
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,950
anyone I date,I have to lie to or
wonder why she's interested in a felon.

284
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,450
- no luck at all?

285
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,200
yeah,jones?

286
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,450
where to?

287
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,460
yeah.

288
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,640
okay,thanks.

289
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,490
holt's gone.

290
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,300
jones checked his credit cards.

291
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,000
he bought a plane ticket
out of the country.

292
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,560
- the only reason I'd buy a plane
ticket under my name with my credit card

293
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,850
is if I wanted someone to
think I'd left the country.

294
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,610
- the airline confirmed
that he got on the plane.

295
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,330
- the airline confirmed someone
with holt's ticket got on the plane.

296
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,230
you know that time you
thought I was in monaco?

297
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,910
- don't tell me that I had interpol
scouring the streets for nothing.

298
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,820
- bought a first
-class ticket under my name and checked in for my flight.

299
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,620
once I got to the gate,I looked for
someone traveling alone with a carry-on.

300
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,670
- if someone checks a bag and doesn't get
on the plane,the flight doesn't take off.

301
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,070
so I offer them my ticket,which
of course they're gonna take

302
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,450
because no sane person facing a 3,000-mile
trip is gonna say no to a seat in first class.

303
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,610
- and they don't suspect
an ulterior motive?

304
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,600
- Not everyone is as naturally
suspicious as you,peter.

305
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,220
- my nature has developed from years
of tracking your suspicious behavior.

306
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,410
so this unsuspecting stranger gets
your ticket,gets on the plane--

307
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,250
- and neal caffrey is
on his way to monaco,

308
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,740
while the real neal caffrey
slips out of the gate unnoticed.

309
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,170
I can't believe you never knew that.

310
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,270
- cameras caught michael holt
scoping out their security system.

311
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,640
- he's still after that egg.

312
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,430
- he thinks it's at the museum.

313
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,620
catching holt in the act is our best
shot at tracking down that stolen t-rex.

314
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,220
- I'll put surveillance teams
outside the museum around the clock.

315
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,090
- keep me posted.
- all right.

316
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,210
- well,I guess someone else enjoyed
that first-class ticket.- so...

317
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,190
holt had 1/2 million
good reasons to stay.

318
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,080
- how did you know what
forsythe was gonna pay holt?

319
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,460
- I found a briefcase full
of cash in his back room.

320
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,650
- and you opened it?

321
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,170
see,this is the reason I
have a suspicious nature.

322
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,300
I'm gonna count every penny of it.

323
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,520
- I don't blame you.you should.

324
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,570
it was a rough estimate
though.it's a round number.

325
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,560
- hey, hon.
- yeah?

326
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,240
- how'd you like to go
on a double date tonight?

327
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,760
- with trey and sheila?

328
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,880
- neal.

329
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,800
- does he know we're coming?

330
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,800
- he doesn't know we're coming.

331
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,770
- he's been sneaking around with this
woman,and I think he's up to something.

332
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,020
- or maybe he's having a
nice meal with a nice girl.

333
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,760
- there's no reason for
neal to keep this from me.

334
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,050
what do I care if he's
going on a date with a girl?

335
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,460
- clearly you care quite a bit.

336
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,160
- nah,there's more to it than this.

337
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,390
a lot of things neal has
been doing don't add up,

338
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,160
and my gut tells me
she's at the center of it.

339
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,750
now according to his
anklet,they're at the clifton.

340
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,510
- you know I've always
wanted to go to the clifton.

341
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,710
- really?

342
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,890
- you think this is a good idea?
- I do.

343
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,470
- Thought you might like this.
- the wine is lovely.

344
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,180
and it reminds me of this summer
that I spent in france studying.

345
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,740
I actually think I've
been to this vineyard.

346
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,580
- really?
- really.

347
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,840
did you have the fbi run
a background check on me?

348
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,550
- the fbi had nothing to do
with this dinner.I promise.

349
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,220
- hmm,you know,you never told
me why you became an fbi agent.

350
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,240
I assume it wasn't
only to pick up women.

351
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,910
how does an art lover
become an fbi agent?

352
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,160
- eh,it's a long story.

353
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,730
- I spend my life
studying ancient texts.

354
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,150
- I don't mind long stories.
- I want this dinner to be about you and me,okay?

355
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,760
we don't need to talk about work.

356
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,840
- all right.

357
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:47,240
I really do like this place and
the wine and the codex and the kiss.

358
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,840
- I liked that part too.

359
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:56,170
- you know,you-- you don't have to do
all this just to get my help on the case.

360
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,890
- do you really think I would do that?
- no.

361
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,840
- what kind of guy do you think I am?
- I don't know.you're an fbi agent.

362
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,810
- yeah.
- if it's too complicated,I'll understand.

363
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,560
- are you trying to give me a way out?

364
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,910
- apparently without much subtlety.
- no.

365
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,770
I don't want one.

366
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,290
do you?

367
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,640
- no.

368
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,150
- neal?

369
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,360
- peter,what are you doing here?

370
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,050
- elizabeth has been dying
to try this place out.

371
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,450
hi,I'm peter,neal's boss.

372
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,830
- we've met.I'm rebecca.you
almost arrested me.

373
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,460
- oh,right.sorry about that.

374
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,800
- no,it's-- Wait,I thought your boss was--
- and this is elizabeth,peter's lovely wife.

375
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,660
- it's so nice to meet you.I'm
really sorry for interrupting.

376
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,830
- oh,nonsense.no secrets between friends,right?
- course not.

377
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,460
- I didn't know that you two had
been in touch since the investigation.

378
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,870
- you guys met on a case?

379
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,760
- oh,yeah,you know how sometimes
your personal and professional lives

380
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,130
just crash into each
other without any notice.

381
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,970
- it's actually how peter and I met.

382
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,000
- yeah,agency resources were
involved from what I recall.

383
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,470
- it was completely aboveboard.

384
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,770
- actually,we were just talking
about how neal became an fbi agent.

385
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,480
- yeah,but it's a long story.

386
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,650
- I know I'd love to hear that story.

387
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,280
- um,I'm gonna go check and
see if we can get a table.

388
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,140
would you like to go with me?

389
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,280
maybe let the boys chat?
- of course.

390
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,390
- see you in a little bit.

391
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,070
what are you doing
here?did you follow me here?

392
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,560
- you have until they come back to
explain why she thinks you're an fbi agent,

393
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,970
or I'm telling her the truth.

394
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,590
- we met on a case.I told
her I work for the fbi.

395
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,050
- she assumed I was an agent.
- and you didn't correct her,did you?

396
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:41,920
- I didn't see any reason to.

397
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,830
- Because you're impersonating
a federal officer.

398
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,240
- I suppose technically-- -
no,not technically.you are.

399
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,900
the pen,the chiropractor's office.

400
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,370
this is all to convince
her of this story.

401
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:58,750
- you're... you like her,don't you?

402
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,500
lying is a funny way of showing it.

403
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,840
- she doesn't look at
me like a criminal,okay?

404
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,500
she looks at me the way el looks at you.

405
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,330
I don't want to ruin that.

406
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,010
- neal,you have lovely friends.
- oh,aren't they great?

407
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,000
we are gonna get out
of your hair right now.

408
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,270
we got a table.come on,let's go.

409
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,860
sure.you two have lots to talk about.

410
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,000
excuse me one minute.

411
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,500
- this is agent burke.
- it's Dr.Khatri.someone's here.

412
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,210
I don't recognize him.

413
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,300
- all right,remain calm,doctor.we
have agents in the museum.

414
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,510
- no,I'm not there.I took the
egg to my lab to run a cat scan.

415
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,070
- hang up and find someplace
safe.we'll be there soon.

416
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,490
neal,we have to
go.Dr.Khatri's in trouble.

417
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,370
- nypd is on the way,but we're closer.

418
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,900
- we're running out of time?you
better tell me where it is?

419
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,390
what,you think I'm playing games?

420
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,730
- I'll never give it to you.
- it's holt.

421
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,380
- I'm not gonna ask again.

422
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,820
- If we go in with guns
drawn,he might shoot her.

423
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,570
- khatri's not giving up that egg.

424
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,460
we gotta come up with something,or
she's gonna get herself killed.

425
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,940
- where the hell is the egg?

426
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,740
- where is the mother?what
have you done with her?

427
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,860
- it's just an egg.tell me where it is.

428
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,280
- it's so much more than that.

429
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,150
it is a child that needs
to be with its mother,

430
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,100
and I'll be damned if I'll
ever give it up to you.

431
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,050
- have it your way.

432
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,990
- doctor,do you have the isotopic
results-- - hold it right there.

433
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,410
I don't want any trouble,okay?

434
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,270
- where is the damn egg?
- I'll show you.

435
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,390
- no,you can't give it to him.

436
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,850
- I'm not taking a bullet
for a fossil,all right?

437
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,630
follow me.

438
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,210
right through here.

439
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,890
- get off of me?

440
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,230
- give me a hand.

441
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,500
- not every thief who
brings their own handcuffs.

442
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,290
- very thoughtful of you.

443
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,240
holt confirmed that forsythe
hired him for the fossil heist.

444
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,480
- so why are you not doing an "about
to get the dinosaur" happy dance?

445
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,000
- because he doesn't know
where the dinosaur is located.

446
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,120
- and if we arrest forsythe now,there's no guarantee we'll get the t
-rex back.

447
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,530
- and our evidence is largely
circumstantial.I want hard proof.

448
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,380
- you want the dinosaur.
- damn right I do.

449
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,080
- Dr.Khatri will be happy to hear that.

450
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,430
just got off with the hospital.

451
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,020
she's fine,just a little shaken up.

452
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,300
- there's only one chip
we can play right now.

453
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,780
the egg.

454
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,040
- we can plant a tracker on it.

455
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,050
- I bet he'll stash it with the t
-rex fossils.

456
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,460
- follow him,make a clean arrest.

457
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,890
- I don't wanna put the egg in play.

458
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,650
it's too valuable,too important.

459
00:24:55,550 --> 00:25:00,690
lucky for us,we know someone
with a history of forging fossils.

460
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,450
- Dr.Khatri gave me fragments of real
calcite shell and sedimentary rock.

461
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,120
I'll sculpt the core from alabaster.

462
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,820
- adhesives?
- already mixed.we should get started.

463
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,770
- I assume you don't mean the royal we?

464
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,130
- a correct assumption.

465
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,950
the hydrochloric acid is reacting perfectly
with the calcium carbonate in the shell.

466
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,980
- we made a baby dinosaur,moz.

467
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,540
- ah,like father,like forged embryo.

468
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,930
each with his own anklet.

469
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,900
- at least peter won't be able
to follow this tracker to rebecca.

470
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,170
- oh,have you spoken to her since your ill
-fated dinner?

471
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,820
I warned you,neal.

472
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,560
you,business,and women.

473
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,470
- unholy trinity,I get it.

474
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:46,110
- well,you can be grateful that the suit
didn't expose your agent nom de guerre.

475
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,500
- well,I am.

476
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,000
what happens when peter digs deeper?

477
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,290
- could find out about the codex.
- yeah,or hagen.

478
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,950
- cause for concern.

479
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,720
keep in mind,to make an
end is to make a beginning.

480
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,150
- you think I should end it with her?

481
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,600
- that was t.s.Eliot.

482
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,100
but if rebecca is on big brother's
radar,the timing could be right.

483
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,410
- all right,do we have a
game plan for the church yet?

484
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,720
- I'm working on it.

485
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,530
but to steal the stained glass window
will be difficult with so many witnesses.

486
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,620
- well,that's a problem
that can wait a day.

487
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,370
- indeed.

488
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,650
today we revive the cretaceous period.

489
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,750
tomorrow we steal a window that could
be connected to a bedlamite's tome.

490
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,580
c'est la vie.

491
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,870
- c'est la vie.

492
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,650
- not bad.

493
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,270
- I was gonna give it to you after this,but
if you don't think it's very good...

494
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,150
"not bad" doesn't mean "not good."
- it doesn't mean "good."

495
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,380
- I'll give it to someone who can appreciate it.
- no,this is fbi property.

496
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,490
I can take it if I want.

497
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,920
- okay,the tracker's live.

498
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,630
when forsythe moves the
egg,we'll be right behind him.

499
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,310
- neal,tell us about your cover.

500
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,620
- john mcdowell.accomplice
to michael holt.

501
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:52,010
here to deliver the egg because the fbi
is looking into holt,and he's laying low.

502
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:55,170
- which was confirmed by holt when he
called forsythe to set up the meeting.

503
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,710
- we'll have ears on
you the whole time.

504
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:00,390
- with a forgery like
this,you should be out quickly.

505
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,890
- with 1/2 million in cash.

506
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,550
- the fbi is investigating
holt?should I worry?

507
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:11,110
- nah,it's just one agent shaking every
tree he can find to see what falls out.

508
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,200
he doesn't have anything.

509
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,920
but to be safe,I'm here instead of holt.

510
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:18,840
hey,if you don't want the egg anymore,I'm
sure I can unload it somewhere else.

511
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:22,010
- no,no,no,no.it's fine.

512
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,160
I wanna see it.

513
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,980
no,it's not yours
yet.not till you pay me.

514
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,250
- you're getting ahead of yourself.

515
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,110
I need to authenticate it first.

516
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,240
- let's get a move on.

517
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,690
ticktock.

518
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,730
- calcite levels and pebble texture appear appropriate.
- I assume that's good news.

519
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,820
- oh,it very much is.

520
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,810
- then I think this is
the part where you pay me.

521
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,970
- I will.after one last test.

522
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:25,450
can't tell you how many times two-bit hustlers
have tried to rip me off with fake artifacts.

523
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,720
which is where the cat
scan comes in handy.

524
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,670
- he won't see an embryo on a cat scan.

525
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,450
- but he will see the tracker.

526
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,950
- the scan will take about
ten minutes.so settle in.

527
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,580
- look,I didn't think this was gonna be an all
-day thing.okay?

528
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,760
- you worried the scan won't work?

529
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,100
- no,I just don't understand
what this thing is gonna show you

530
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,410
that all the other tests didn't.

531
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,530
- it'll show me what's inside.

532
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,780
or what isn't.

533
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,570
- we need to pull neal out of there.

534
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,920
- wait,Dr.Khatri should
have a cat scan of the egg.

535
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,630
- I'll call to see if
she can send one to us.

536
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,220
- you ever heard of a macuahuitl?

537
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,910
- It's the weapon you're
holding in your hands right now.

538
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,570
- what else can you tell
me about this weapon,john?

539
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,960
anything about this one in particular?

540
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,350
- I stole it for you eight years
ago with holt right here in new york.

541
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,720
you're holding it wrong.

542
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,320
you mind?

543
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,910
the early macuahuitl handle
is 2 inches wider at the top.

544
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,830
hold it like this.

545
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:55,760
better grip means a
faster swing.more control.

546
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
- you're right.

547
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:13,670
- you know,I've stolen a lot of things,but
I've rarely taken anything just to have it.

548
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,120
- you should try it sometime.

549
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,290
we should be at the
embryo any moment now.

550
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,770
yeah?

551
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,550
why is he here?

552
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,950
fine.

553
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,360
I'll be right there.

554
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,830
- who's here?

555
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,630
- that fbi agent.

556
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,870
still shaking his trees.

557
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,360
don't worry,I'll get rid of him.

558
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,890
- Mr.Forsythe,thanks for seeing
me.I won't take up much of your time.

559
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:05,080
michael holt,he's our prime suspect
in the fossil shipment theft.

560
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,500
- what's it got to do with me?

561
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,430
- I was wondering if maybe he
approached you on buying them.

562
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,370
- well,if he contacts
me,you'll be my first call.

563
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,020
- all I wanted to hear.

564
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,420
- then you'll be on your way.

565
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:26,540
- you know,even though their
name means "speedy thief,"

566
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:30,110
they say that the velociraptor
wasn't particularly fast.

567
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,840
- that's true.
- and that it was dumb.

568
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,460
Yeah,not much room for
a brain in there,I guess.

569
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,230
one slow,dumb chicken with big teeth.

570
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,950
- don't touch the skull.

571
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,490
- how do you keep them glued in there?

572
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:48,420
epoxy or tacky?
- agent burke,don't...

573
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,480
guess you should've used superglue.

574
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,920
- is that all?

575
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,090
sorry I broke your dinosaur.

576
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,690
- well,will you look at that?

577
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,550
money's in the briefcase.

578
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,620
- pleasure doing business with you.

579
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,870
- the things people do when
they think no one's watching.

580
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,980
- like following your friend
to a first date and crashing it?

581
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,440
- come on.

582
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,860
Let's show forsythe how the
fbi handles natural selection.

583
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,120
- you just think of that one?
- yeah,on the way over.

584
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,740
- what the hell are you doing here?

585
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,190
- I thought about what you said.

586
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,990
I figured out what I wanna take.

587
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,940
- how'd you follow me?

588
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,730
- that little guy
told me where you were.

589
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,220
- or at least a gps tracker
we put inside it did.

590
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,140
- let's go.

591
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,930
- open it up.

592
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:10,410
- okay,that definitely
captures my imagination.

593
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,040
- you know,it's not too late
for you to be a paleontologist.

594
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,350
- some things are better
enjoyed from a distance.

595
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,130
- oh,like grand larceny.

596
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,710
- are all of your hobbies illegal?

597
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:27,810
- I like chess.

598
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,510
- you hustled chess in union square.

599
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,130
- agent burke.

600
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,880
Mr.Caffrey,follow
me.you need to see this.

601
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,400
here she is.

602
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,850
- she's...
- majestic.

603
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,370
- this mother and child reunion was
only possible because of you two.

604
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,330
the museum is in your debt.

605
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,420
- I know someone who would love a year
-round pass.

606
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,780
- agent burke,you have vip status
here.our doors are always open.

607
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,770
- peter burke,vip.we should get you a badge.
- quiet.

608
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,210
thank you,doctor.
- thank you.

609
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,780
- come by the house for dinner tonight.

610
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,270
el's cooking branzino.

611
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,360
- branzino,look at you.

612
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,260
- I can be fancy.

613
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,450
- thanks for the invitation,but--
- it's not an invitation.

614
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,540
- so it's an order?
- 7:00 p.m.

615
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,330
don't be late,agent caffrey.

616
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,070
- bad news.

617
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,940
- another amazing meal.

618
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,290
- well,it should be.it's your recipe.

619
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,920
- should've thrown it on a barbecue.

620
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,650
- never let him be sous chef.

621
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,330
- he's actually very
good on the barbecue.

622
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,270
- so...rebecca.

623
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,840
- yeah,rebecca.

624
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,050
- what do you wanna know?

625
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,630
- have you told her everything?

626
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,610
- everything?

627
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,810
- why you're working for the fbi?

628
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:56,850
- Why you're wearing an anklet?

629
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,800
- has she seen it?

630
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,550
- okay,I was waiting
for the right time.

631
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,890
- There's no right time,neal.

632
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,670
- what do you think happens
if I tell her the truth?

633
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,520
- the more time passes,the
more the truth will hurt.

634
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,610
if you really want this
to work,tell her now.

635
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,980
pray she'll accept it.

636
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,090
- you agree?

637
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,580
- if you really care about rebecca,she
deserves to know the real you.

638
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:27,470
- okay,if peter had told you
something like this when you first met,

639
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,340
would you have accepted it?

640
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,780
- honestly,neal,I--
I don't know.

641
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,360
but I'd want the choice to decide.

642
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,550
and so will rebecca.

643
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,770
it's a risk you should take.

644
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,510
- I don't wanna ask
why you have that thing.

645
00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:00,030
- mm,it was there for
the taking.thank you.

646
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,140
- you're welcome.

647
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,800
cheers.
- cheers.

648
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,540
byron always said the city spoke to him.

649
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,610
- I can relate to that.

650
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,600
- you're a lot like him.

651
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:19,060
- how did you feel when he
told you he was a criminal?

652
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,770
- it hurt.

653
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,310
but I loved him.

654
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,590
and it didn't matter what he was.

655
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,830
it only mattered who he was.

656
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,080
- I wish I could separate the two.

657
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,300
- well,you'll learn with time.

658
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,630
- just a second.

659
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,500
find something new?

660
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,550
- yeah.
- great.

661
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:04,900
- no.

662
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:11,580
I was gonna lie,pretend I found
something,but I just wanted to come see you.

663
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:15,160
whatever this is between us,I...

664
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,840
i don't want it to stop.

665
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,180
- I don't either.

666
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,070
- yeah?

667
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,600
- but there's something
you should know about me.

668
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,980
- okay.

669
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,460
- I'm not an fbi agent.

670
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,030
I'm a criminal informant.

671
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:50,310
I was convicted of bond forgery and served part
of a four-year sentence before I became a c.i.

672
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,750
- I'm--I don't
understand.

673
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:56,720
I've been to your office.I've been
working with your boss,agent gruetzner.

674
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:00,640
- yeah,he's not my boss.my real boss
is peter burke,who you met at dinner.

675
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:06,710
that office was just a setup
to get your help with the codex.

676
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,580
- you set up a fake office
all so you could lie to me?

677
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:14,130
- are you even researching the codex?
- I am.

678
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,840
just not for the fbi.

679
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,220
rebecca.

680
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,400
- why would you do this to me?

681
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,060
- I need your help,all right?

682
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:34,000
and I-- I didn't expect
this.I didn't expect us.

683
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,170
- is there anything else I should know?

684
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,520
- thank you.

685
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,250
I think I was
just-- - june?

686
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,230
- neal?

687
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:32,040
I was just chatting with
this wonderful man,mr...

688
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,390
- you can call me "curtis."

689
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,510
- curtis.it's a lovely name.
- thank you.

690
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,580
- well,I think...

691
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,250
I'll just be running along.

692
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,340
- you stay away from her,hagen.

693
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,260
- quite the life you've built.

694
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,470
hate to see things fall
apart over one little window.

695
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,410
that's right,I know that the
codex leads to the window.

696
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,120
Isn't it lucky you were already
planning to steal it for me?

697
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,560
That was what you were
planning,wasn't it?

698
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,380
- of course.
- good.

699
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,120
that would be best for everyone.
