1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,800
Teyla，这儿你熟悉吗？
Anything look familiar to you Teyla?

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,900
不，我想我以前没有来过这儿
No, I do not think this is a world I have visited before.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,900
这儿也没什么显著标志，你是怎么判断的？
Without landmarks, how can you tell?

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,800
我们在天上很难判断
但每个星球都有自己独特的一面
It is difficult by air, but every
world is unique in it's own way.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,100
我看过很多来自SG部队的报告
就是关于这样的行动的
I've heard a lot of reports from SG teams,
on missions like this one.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,800
特别是Samantha Carter上校的行动报告
Specifically the mission reports
of Colonel Samantha Carter.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,600
几年前，我和她一起工作过
参加一个阻止地球灾难的行动
She and I worked together to avert
global catastrophe a few years back,

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,200
我还和她……
and she and I ...

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,800
我刚说到哪了？
What was I saying?

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,900
行动报告
Mission reports.

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,800
好吧，很明显，有生命存在的星球
都有很多令人惊异的相似之处
Right. Well apparently, there's remarkable
similarities between worlds that support life.

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,400
有道理，例如天空的颜色，就是……
It makes sense really
For example, the colour of the sky, which is a product...

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,100
那是什么？
What was that?

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,500
湍流?
Turbulence?

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,600
现在好像没事了，我在想刚刚发生什么事了？
Seems to be ok now. I wonder what that was?

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,800
出现一个严重冲突的数据
Getting seriously conflicting readings.

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,000
看起来像是一个强大的能量场
大约2000码远
Looks like some sort of powerful energy field,
about 2000 yards over there.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,100
在哪儿？
Over where?

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,800
在我们正前方18度
18 degrees from our correct heading.

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,400
有必要检查一下吗？
Is it worth checking out?

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,800
任何重要的能量数据都意味着技术进步
Any significant energy reading,
generally means technological civilisation.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,300
所以你觉得有必要检查
So you think it's worth checking out.

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,600
不错，能量场看起来很稳定
I'm sorry. Yes. Energy field good.

24
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,100
也许不是
Maybe not

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,100
越来越糟了
It's getting worse.

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,900
行了，我要离开这儿了
That's enough, I'm getting out of here.

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,300
我们没有海拔显示了
We're not gaining any altitude.

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,300
控制系统失灵了
Controls are unresponsive.

29
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,400
驱动器掉线了
The drive just went offline.

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,300
我们要进去了
We're going in!

31
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,600
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季第6集 童年的终结
Season 1 : Episode 6
Childhood's End

32
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,000
先生，安全着陆
Nice landing sir.

33
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,900
谢谢
Thankyou

34
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,200
发生什么事了？
What happened?

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,600
我们离能量场太近了
We got too close to the energy field.

36
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,000
谁出的主意
Who's idea was that?

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,700
你犯错，我也犯错
You made mistakes, I made mistakes.

38
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,700
咱俩就狗咬狗吧
Let's not get caught in the blame game.

39
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,800
好吧，你到底能不能修好飞船？
Ok, can you fix the ship or not?

40
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,700
我的检测仪器都失灵了
None of my diagnostic equipment is working.

41
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,100
太阳依然悬挂在天空
The sun is still high in the sky.

42
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,100
什么意思？
What does that mean?

43
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,300
我们能在天黑之前回到星门
We can make it back to the Stargate before dark.

44
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,300
如果我们想离开，现在就要行动了
If we intend to leave, we should start now.

45
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,300
你和Zelenka能回去修好它吗？
Zelenka and you can return to fix it?

46
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,000
不，不，少校，你不明白
No, no, no Major. You don't understand.

47
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,000
这不是飞船的问题，我的设备在这儿一个也无法使用
It's not just the jumper. None of my equipment is working either.

48
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,800
好吧，加油
Alright. Let's gear up.

49
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,800
检查一下，长官。
我觉得我的指南针开始摇摆不定
Check it out sir. I think my compass has gone wonky.

50
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,400
你把磁力指南针带到了
另外一个星系的星球上？
You brought a magnetic compass
to another planet in another galaxy?

51
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,100
你完全不知道这个星球的磁场是否……
You have absolutely no way of knowing
if this planets magnetic field is....

52
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,200
等一会
Wait a second.

53
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,100
让我看看
Let me see that.

54
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,100
摇摆不定是由电磁引起的
The disturbance is electro-magnetic.

55
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,900
这也许能解释为什么我们的设备都失效了
That probably explains why all our equipment is out.

56
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,000
星门在哪个方位
Which direction is the gate?

57
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,500
你是驾驶员你还不知道？
You were the one flying. Shouldn't you know?

58
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,900
好，我应该能辨别出来
Alright. Should be able to figure this out.

59
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,100
我认为是在这个方位
I believe it is this way.

60
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,000
出发吧
Let's move out.

61
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,800
嗨！我们能往那边走吗？
Hey! Can we go that way for a bit?

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,500
为什么？
Why?

63
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,800
Ford中尉的指南针指向很怪异
我们可能有点误差
Lt Ford's compass is acting weird.
We may be onto something.

64
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,900
真高兴，我把指南针带到这里了
I'm glad I brought it along.

65
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,900
你还挺有先见之明的
How prescient of you.

66
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,900
哦耶，是这个方向
Didn't fly over this

67
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,900
我们飞来的时候经过这儿了吗？
 on the way in did we?

68
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,500
我不知道，那时候我正注意观察周围
可能袭击我们的东西
I don't know. I was kinda busy with
the whole trying not to get us killed thing.

69
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,400
这些古迹年代很久远了
These ruins are very old.

70
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,000
至少几百年了，我敢说，也许更久
Several hundred years at least, I'd say, maybe more.

71
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,900
所以这里的居民已经绝迹了
So the population here's extinct?

72
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,100
看看这个
Check this out.

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,700
我放弃了
Ok, I give up.

74
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,500
如果这种摇摆是人为原因
而不是自然现象
Well if the disturbance is man made
instead of naturally occurring,

75
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,600
那就很可能是这些古迹中的放射性物质造成的
it's probably emanating from within these ruins.

76
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,100
在那里
Somewhere over there.

77
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,300
如果我们找到它，能关掉吗？
Well if we find it, can we shut it off?

78
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,100
如果我们能关掉能量场，那就值得一试
Well it's worth a shut. If we can shut down the field,

79
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,300
那我们就能回到星门
we can walk back to the gate.

80
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,900
我正在想给自己留一个最好的飞船
I was thinking of saving a perfectly good puddle jumper.

81
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,100
我也想
That too.

82
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,800
好吧，兄弟们
我们在这呆一会，看看McKay是否能够……
Alright guys.
Let's stay here for a second, see if McKay can....

83
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,400
Ford，他们只是小孩
They're kids Ford.

84
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,900
用武器指着我们的小孩
Yeah, with weapons pointed at us.

85
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,300
中尉，把你的武器放低点
Lower your weapon Lt.

86
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,800
你们好，孩子们
Hey kids.

87
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,800
我们不会伤害你们的
We're not here to harm you in any way.

88
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
没错，就像她说的那样
That's right. What she she said.

89
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,300
我们很友好
We're friendly, ok?

90
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,300
我们穿过星门来到这儿
We arrived through the Stargate.

91
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,900
只是想回到我们来的地方
We were only trying to return home.

92
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,600
我想他们听不懂
I don't think they understand.

93
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,900
我相信他们听得懂
I believe they do.

94
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,800
他们仍然拿箭指着我们
They're still pointing arrows at us.

95
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
你们是成年人
You're full grown.

96
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,400
什么？
Excuse me?

97
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,700
你们需要去见长者
You need to see the elders

98
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,800
长者，听起来不错，你们带路吧
Elders. Sounds good. Just lead the way.

99
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,500
成年人？
Full growns?

100
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
少校
Major

101
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,900
他们从哪儿弄到这些东西的？
Now where did they get that?

102
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,200
看起来像个神龛
It looks like a shrine

103
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,300
你觉得他们应该不会供奉幽灵吧
You don't think they worship the Wraith do you?

104
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,600
-极有可能
  -这就麻烦了
- That would be a first.
- It would be disturbing.

105
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,400
幽灵的骨头
Wraith bones.

106
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
是的，我们知道
Yeah, we know

107
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,000
这是几年前从天上掉下来的幽灵船
It's death boat fell out of the sky, years ago.

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,700
我们把它留在这儿，提醒我们别忘了过去的生活
We keep it here to remind us of how life used to be.

109
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,100
过去？
Used to be?

110
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,800
从前
Before

111
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,800
从天上掉下来
Fell out of sky.

112
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,200
哦，我注意到了
Yeah, I picked up on that.

113
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,600
你觉得击落它的东西也就是击落我们的东西吗？
You think whatever knocked us down, knocked it down?

114
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,300
很有可能。如果真是这样，我们需要找到它
It's possible. If that's the case, we need to find it.

115
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,800
为什么
Why?

116
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,800
因为有什么东西有那么大的力量
能把幽灵击落？肯定是个好东西
Because anything powerful enough
to knock out a Wraith dart? It's a big deal.

117
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,100
是啊，我们要是能拥有就好了
Yeah, that would be nice to have.

118
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,000
长者准备见你们了
The elders are ready.

119
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,700
嗨，很荣幸见到你
Hi, nice to meet you.

120
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,800
我是Karris，这里的长者之一
I am Karris. One of the village elders

121
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,600
我是Sheppard，这是Rodney和Teyla和……
I'm Sheppard, and this is Rodney and Teyla and....

122
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,900
你刚刚说你是这里的长者之一？
Did you say you were one of the elders?

123
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,100
是的
Yes

124
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,800
你多大了
How old are you?

125
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,700
24岁
24

126
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
24岁就是长者？
That makes you an elder?

127
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,200
Sheppard，你怎么到这儿的？
How did you get here Sheppard?

128
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,100
我们通过星门从我们的星球来到这儿的
We used the Stargate to travel
from our world, to visit yours.

129
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,700
你应该知道星门
You do know of the Stargate.

130
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,400
这是一个大大的、圆圆的东西
It's a big round....thing.

131
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,900
500年来都没有人从那个大井里穿行了
No-one has come through the well for nearly 500 years.

132
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,700
是的，就是一个大井。我们迷路了
Yeah well, here's the thing. We're a little lost.

133
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,700
你们都是超过24岁的长者
And you are all older than 24.

134
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,500
Ford?你多大了？
Ford? How old are you?

135
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,000
25岁
25 sir.

136
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,900
我猜是这样
I guess so.

137
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,200
有问题吗？
Is that a problem?

138
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,200
请坐
Please, sit.

139
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,300
Karris，他们是入侵者
我们没有必要向他们解释
They are trespassers Karris,
we don't have to explain ourselves.

140
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,300
我道歉
I apologise.

141
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,300
你们也知道幽灵吗？
You are familiar with the Wraith?

142
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,700
是的
Yes

143
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,900
但我们和幽灵不是朋友
Well we're not friends or anything like that.

144
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,300
幽灵过去侵占了我们的星球
The Wraith used to farm our planet.

145
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,100
就像我们过去豢养家禽和野兽一样
As we used to farm livestock and beasts of burden.

146
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,200
只有我们是他们的畜群
Only we were their herd.

147
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,900
是的，他们到哪里都那样做
Yeah, they seem to do that everywhere.

148
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,400
我们的祖先抗击过他们
但我们的武器不够先进
Our ancestors fought them,
but our weapons were not strong enough.

149
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,300
我们试着躲起来
但他们总能找到我们
Our people tried to hide from them,
but they were always found.

150
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,500
没有人能安乐的死去
没有人能得到永恒的安宁
None died peacefully.
None could enter into the eternal rest.

151
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,800
永恒的安宁？
Eternal rest?

152
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,500
死在幽灵的手里
To die at the hands of the Wraith.

153
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:13,900
在仇恨和邪恶中咽下最后一口气
To breathe your last breath amongst such hatred and evil.

154
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,200
你不可能安宁的去到另外一个世界
这就是命运
There is no way to move peacefully into
the next world, when that is your fate.

155
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:24,100
我们的先人认为要打败幽灵
必须要像幽灵那样思考
My ancestors decided that to beat the Wraith,
we must learn to think as they think.

156
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,900
我们决定不给幽灵留下任何一个有利用价值的人
We ensure that we never provide
the Wraith with a crop worth picking.

157
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,000
怎么做到？
By?

158
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,500
我们没有人活过24岁
None of us passes the age of 24.

159
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,300
用什么方法？
How do you manage that?

160
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,900
在我们25岁的前夜，我们就祭祀
On the eve of our 25th year, we make the sacrifice.

161
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:46,500
为了我们的族人和我们自己
能够安宁的进入另外一个世界
Both for our people and for our own
safe passage into the eternal rest.

162
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,600
什么？
What?

163
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,200
你们互相残杀？
You kill each other?

164
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,400
不，我们自行了断
No. We take our own lives.

165
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,800
所以幽灵已经500多年没有来这儿了
And so the Wraith have not returned for nearly 500 years.

166
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,600
我从来都没像现在这样觉得自己已经很老了
Never in my life have I ever felt so old.

167
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,900
毋庸置疑，这是我能想像到的最悲惨的生活
This is without a doubt, the most
screwed up way of life I can imagine.

168
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,300
他们好像已经习惯了
They seem to accept it.

169
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,500
他们只是孩子，怎么会知道呢？
They're kids, what do they know?

170
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,100
孩子们不希望我们在这儿
Kids that don't want to keep us around.

171
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,400
因为他们觉得我们的到来会引来幽灵
Because they believe our presence
may bring back the Wraith.

172
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,900
他们这么想是不对的，是吗？
They can't be right can they?

173
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,200
幽灵放过他们是因为他们还很小吗？
What the Wraith just ignore them,
because they're young?

174
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,900
我想起了小牛犊，是不是很相似
Reminds me of veal. Can't be the same thing can it?

175
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,700
当然不是，小牛肉很美味的
Of course not. Veal is delicious.

176
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,400
幽灵再也不来了是因为
他们的飞船一靠近这个村庄
The Wraith don't come by anymore,
because when their darts fly close to the villages,

177
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,800
电磁场就会干扰他们
the electro magnetic field takes them out.

178
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,500
就像干扰我们的飞船那样
Much like what happened to our Puddle Jumper.

179
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,900
他们为什么不在干扰之外的地方着陆
然后步行过来？
Why do they not just land outside
the disturbance and take the village by foot?

180
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,900
对不起，也许我没说清楚
任何东西在这儿都不起作用
I'm sorry, perhaps I'm not being clear.
Nothing works here!

181
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,400
他们的迷幻术、他们的飞船都不行
Not their stunners, their darts.

182
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,500
甚至连他们的防御设备也不能正常运行
Even their shields wouldn't function correctly.

183
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,300
我是说他们没必要冒这么大险
I mean, why would they risk their advantage,

184
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,200
因为通过星门还有很多地方有他们的猎物
when there's a smorgasbord,
through some other stargate?

185
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,500
我们的枪在这儿可以使用，是吗？
Our guns work though, right?

186
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,700
因为他们相对来说比较原始
他们不需要一个电磁场来启动
Because they're relatively primitive.
They don't generate an EM field.

187
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,200
我们必须告诉他们
We must tell them.

188
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,900
在我有机会检查这个古迹之前不要告诉他们
Not before I've had a chance
to look at those ruins, we don't.

189
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,900
他们毫无理由的自杀
They're sacrificing themselves for no reason.

190
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,900
Teyla，我们要告诉他们什么？
What are we going to tell them Teyla?

191
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,300
听着，孩子们！你们所相信的那些东西都是错的
Listen kiddies, everything you believe to be true is wrong,

192
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,200
相信我们吧，因为我们到这儿已经有一个小时了
and trust us, because we've been here for almost an hour.

193
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,400
我们讨论过了
你们可以呆在这儿，直到你们修好飞船
We've talked it over.
You can stay until you've fixed your ship.

194
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,100
但是你们必须快点
But you must work quickly.

195
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,100
你们来这儿让我们感觉很不舒服
Your being here makes our people uncomfortable.

196
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,900
这已经够公平了，我们尽快吧
That's fair enough. We'll work as quickly as we can.

197
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,200
在你们遇到我们的那个地方的古迹里
可能有些什么东西
There may have been something
in the ruins where you picked us up that,

198
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,100
使我们的飞船失去了控制
caused us to lose control of our ship.

199
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,800
他们任何时候都应该被监视
They should be watched at all times.

200
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,900
哦，不，很好！完全可以理解
No, no, no, that's fine. Totally understandable.

201
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,700
我会派两个村民来跟着你们
I'll choose two of the villagers to keep an eye on you.

202
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,200
Casta说你有100岁了，是吗？
Casta say's you're 100 years old. Are you?

203
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,300
谁是Casta？
Who's Casta?

204
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,400
我
Me.

205
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,800
Casta，你是从哪儿听来的？
Where are you getting your information Casta?

206
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,100
你们为什么要去那个古迹？
Why are you going to the old city?

207
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,400
- 我们要检查一些东西
- 什么东西？
- I gotta check something.
- What kind of thing?

208
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,800
这是大人的事情
It's grown up stuff.

209
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
什么是大人？
What's a grown up.

210
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,900
比你年长的人
Someone that's older than you are.

211
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,100
我比Claire大3岁，你告诉我吧
I'm 3 years older than Claire. You can tell me.

212
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,600
很好，但是你不是大人
Nice try, but you're not a grown up.

213
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,000
你刚刚说比我年长的人就是大人
But you just said,
someone that's older than me is a grown up.

214
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,800
我不需要你来告诉我我刚刚说了什么，好吗？
I don't need you to tell me what I just said, ok?

215
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,400
好
Ok

216
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,200
你们为什么要去那个古迹？
So, why are we going to the old city?

217
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,800
Ford，我需要你的救援
Ford, a little help here.

218
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,800
你在说什么？你是白痴
What are you talking about? You're a natural.

219
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,400
让我们来看看我们能多久不说话
Let's see how long we can be quiet.

220
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,900
谁会是最久的呢，嗯？
Who can be quiet the longest, huh?

221
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,400
哦，我是不是个安静的人?
Well, I'm not a quiet person.

222
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,800
那不是安静，你已经在说话了
That's not quiet. That's talking.

223
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,700
我不是个安静的人，我话很多
Well I'm not a quiet person. I talk a lot.

224
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,600
你有小孩吗？
You have young?

225
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,400
我？还没有，你呢？
Me? No. Not yet anyway. You?

226
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,100
我有了，他们在另外一个村子里
Oh yes. They're raised in one of the other villages.

227
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,600
另外一个村子？
Other villages?

228
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,500
延续我们家的香火
To keep family lines apart.

229
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,900
天啊，像这样的村子有多少个？
God. How many villages are there like this?

230
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,800
12个，他们都比这个要大一点
但是人数要少
Twelve. There are few larger than this one,
but, more smaller in number.

231
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,500
他们都自杀吗？
And they all make the sacrifice?

232
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,600
是的，我们都这样
就像我们先人那样
Yes. We all do. As have the many before.

233
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,200
没有人曾经……
No-one ever....

234
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,200
什么？
What?

235
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,400
就是决定打破这个规矩
离开这里或者逃走
Well, decides not to go through with it.
Takes off. Runs away.

236
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,400
我们有过犹豫
There has been hesitation.

237
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,900
我打赌
I bet.

238
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:32,200
只要时机合适，我们是可以被说服的
We can be persuasive when the time comes.

239
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,300
我知道这是什么意思
I know what that means

240
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,300
听着，我想告诉你
Look, I gotta tell you.

241
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,200
我完全不理解这是怎么回事
I don't understand this at all.

242
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,200
在我来的那个地方
我们珍惜生命超过一切
Where I come from, we value life
more than almost anything else.

243
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,400
Ford中尉，他只比你大1岁
Lt Ford, he's just a year older than you.

244
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,000
你知道如果他1年前就死了
他会错过多少美好的东西吗？
Do you know what he would have
missed out on if his life was over a year ago?

245
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,800
我们其实没有那么多不同
We're not all that different.

246
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:07,100
只是我宁愿拥有24年的宁静
也不愿意一辈子都活在恐惧里
It's just that I would rather have 24 years of peace,
than a life of fear.

247
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,800
但如果有另外一条出路呢？
What if there's another way.

248
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,900
自然，当时机到来的时候
Naturally, when the time comes.

249
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,400
时机到了
The time comes.

250
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,600
当然了，那是生命的一部分
Well of course it does, that's part of living a life.

251
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,100
我是说我自己
明天是我25岁的第一天
I mean for me. Tomorrows the first day of my 25th year.

252
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,900
明天？
Tomorrow?

253
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,200
是的，这就是为什么我是这里的头
Yes. That's why I lead the council of elders.

254
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,500
我是所有24岁的人中最大的
I'm oldest among the 24's.

255
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,700
你是说明天你要……
You mean tomorrow you um....

256
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,700
今晚
Tonight.

257
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,500
今晚？
Tonight?

258
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,800
我们的规定很久之前就定下来了，现在依然在执行
Our rule was put in place long ago, and it works.

259
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,900
这不容我去质疑
今晚我就要死了
It is not for me to question it. Tonight I die.

260
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,100
多少个人？
How many?

261
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,600
4个，他们说就他们4个
但是我们不敢肯定，也许更多
Four. They claim they're alone,
but we can't be sure. There may be more.

262
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,800
你给他们修飞船的时间了吗？
And you've given them time to repair the ship?

263
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,200
是的，这和我的想法正好相反
Against my strong objection, yes.

264
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,900
所以Karris
So this is Karris.

265
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,000
正在为自杀做准备了
没有心思考虑这些人的事情了
Who should be readying himself for sacrifice,
not troubling with the full growns.

266
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
明天我就是最大的了
但那可能太迟了
I will be the eldest by tomorrow,
but that may be too late.

267
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,200
你想干什么？
What do you want to do?

268
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,500
Louise，他们是从幽灵的那个大井里来的
They came through the Wraith well, Louise.

269
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,100
如果他们呆在这儿，幽灵就会来
那我们的牺牲就没有价值了
If they stay, the Wraith may come back,
and all our sacrifice may be for nothing.

270
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,300
我们需要立刻行动
强迫他们离开这里
This calls for action. They must be forced to leave.

271
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,200
我需要时间和其它村民讨论一些
I need time to talk to the other villages.

272
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,100
没时间了
We have little of it.

273
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,500
Aries，你是知道规则的
如果不让Karris知道这件事会很不好
You know the laws, Aries.
It's bad enough we're leaving Karris out of this.

274
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,600
强制的行动必须由村民们一致同意
A forced sacrifice must be agreed upon, by all the villages.

275
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,700
离我们远点
Leave us!

276
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,500
你爱和谁讨论就和谁讨论吧
Talk with who you need to talk.

277
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,600
我让他们今天就走
I will give them until the end of this day to leave.

278
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,600
如果他们不走……
If they do not....

279
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,100
嗨，嗨，让一下，谢谢！
Hey, hey. Coming through. Thankyou.

280
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,600
- 那是什么？
- 指南针
- What's that?
- It's a compass

281
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,300
- 指南针是什么？
- 在地球上用来辨别方向的
- What's that?
- Used for determining direction, on Earth.

282
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,600
- 我用它来……
- 地球在哪儿？
- I'm using it to....
- Where's Earth?

283
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,300
听着，Cleo？
Listen, Cleo?

284
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,200
Casta
Casta

285
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,900
叫什么都行，你们不是来监视的吗？
Whatever. Aren't you supposed to be observing.

286
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,700
知道什么叫监视吗？
Understand what that means? Observing?

287
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,900
监视？
Observing?

288
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,300
就是说他们让你们来观察
It means you're supposed to watch.

289
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,700
你们要离我们远一点，然后仔细观察
You're supposed to stay out of my way and watch.

290
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,400
为什么？
Why?

291
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,500
因为
Because

292
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
因为什么？
Because why?

293
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,600
因为是我说的
Because I say so.

294
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,200
为什么？
Why?

295
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,100
因为你们在我耳边吵来吵去问一些愚蠢的问题
我什么也干不了
Because I can't get any work done,
with you two buzzing around asking stupid questions,

296
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,100
还有你们愚蠢的声音
坐下来，闭嘴！
with your stupid little voices. Now sit down and shut up!

297
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,500
哦，别这样，别这样！
Oh don't. Don't.

298
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,300
你真粗鲁
You're mean

299
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,300
谢谢你们终于注意到这点了
Thankyou for finally noticing.

300
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,200
你们想死吗，你们想死吗，嗯？
Ok, you wanna go? You wanna go, huh?

301
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,600
好了，好了
你得到了孩子们真正的礼物
Ok, ok, ok. You've got a real gift with the kids, there.

302
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,400
你开过生日party吗？
Do you do birthday parties?

303
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,400
我还有事，你对付他们吧
让一让，谢谢！
Look, I have a purpose here.
You deal with them. Excuse me, thankyou.

304
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,200
没事了，没事了
因为你们比他聪明，所以他很恼火
It's ok. It's ok.
He's just upset because you're smarter than him.

305
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,600
你们知道什么是巧克力吗？
不知道？那给你们一个大大的惊喜吧
You guys know what chocolate is?
No? This is gonna be huge.

306
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,000
过来，我们到那儿去吧
让这个粗鲁的人自己呆着吧
Come on, we're gonna go over here,
and we're gonna leave the mean old man alone.

307
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,900
哦耶
Oh yeah.

308
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,100
好
Ok.

309
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,700
喂！喂！
Hello hello.

310
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,900
真好吃，还要吗？
Really Good. Hmmm More?

311
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,800
少校
Major!

312
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,100
McKay? 通话器可以用了
McKay? The radio's working.

313
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,500
我正在用它和你说话呢
Which is how I'm able to speak with you, yes.

314
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,100
你有空吗？
You have a second?

315
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,600
告诉我你找到了能量场发生器
Tell me you found the field generator.

316
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,100
我发现了能量场发生器
I found the field generator.

317
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,200
很明显，你把它关了
Obviously the off switch.

318
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,300
不仅如此
那个装置是由Z.P.M发动的
Better than that.
The device is powered by a Zero Point Module.

319
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,800
这绝对是几个世纪以来支撑能量场的东西
It's definitely the Em field has been online for centuries.

320
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,800
就我所知，只有Z.P.M才能支撑那么久
As far as I know, only a ZPm is
capable of powering it for that long.

321
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,000
我关掉了，一切恢复正常了
I've shut it down. Everything is working now.

322
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,300
你关闭了防御工事？
You've disabled the shield?

323
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,100
只是暂时的
Just temporarily.

324
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,800
我需要把Z.P.M带回亚特兰帝斯
我正在看这样做是否值得
I need to get the ZPM back to Atlantis.
See if it's worth taking.

325
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,500
我们不能把它带走
这个他们对付幽灵唯一的防御设备
We cannot just take it.
It is their only source of protection against the Wraith.

326
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,200
证据表明幽灵很多年没来这儿了
There's no evidence that
the Wraith have been here in years.

327
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,400
另外，这是一个完好的Z.P.M
Besides, this is a fully functioning ZPM.

328
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,600
我们要把它们都带回亚特兰帝斯
困难有多大？
We could bring them all back to Atlantis.
How hard could that be?

329
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,600
很困难，带走Z.P.M会有很多问题
Hard, but, a ZPM could make a lot of problems go away.

330
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,900
确实，我需要把它带回实验室
Exactly, I need to get it back to a lab.

331
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,100
你打算怎么做？
How do you plan on doing that?

332
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,900
我已经有合适的基因
而且你也给我上过飞行课
Well I've had the gene innoculation
and you've already given me a flying lesson.

333
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,600
问题远比那复杂
It's gonna take more than a shot
in the arm and a flying lesson.

334
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,100
听着，我要和幽灵进行空战
Listen, I'm not gonna be dogfighting Wraith darts.

335
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,600
我和Ford能够完成这个任务
Ford and I can handle it.

336
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,900
好吧，你们可以去
天黑之前要回我这儿
All right.
Fine, you can go. But get back to me before tonight?

337
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,800
他们给我们下了最后通牒
We sort of have a deadline.

338
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,000
好的
Right

339
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,500
我觉得让这些村子失去防御工事是很危险的
I think it is dangerous to leave the villages unprotected.

340
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,500
小孩们说得对
幽灵已经很久很久没来过了
The kids got a point.
The Wraith haven't been around in a very long time.

341
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,900
这样做很鲁莽，少校
This is reckless Major.

342
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,900
你必须明白这一点
You must see that.

343
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,300
放心，他们出现的几率有多大，
Common, what are the odds
they're going to show up...

344
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,600
在Mckay进行这些测试的这几个小时里？
...in the few hours it takes McKay
to run those tests?

345
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,400
这些向导为什么被送回村里？
Why were the guides sent back to the village?

346
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,500
是吗？
Were they?

347
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,100
是的
Yeah, they were.

348
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,100
也许到了午睡的时间了
Must have been nap time.

349
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Sheppard，你觉得这是开玩笑吗？
You think this is a joke, Sheppard?

350
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,700
我不觉得周围发生的一切很可笑
I don't find much that's going
on around here, to be funny.

351
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,900
怎么了？
What's wrong?

352
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,600
两个成年人不在我们的监视范围内
Two of the full growns are out on watch.

353
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,100
Aries，你应该为今天晚上做准备了。
It's fine Aries. You should be getting ready for tonight, Karris.

354
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,700
净洗仪式就要开始了，你还没有……
The cleansing ceremony is set to begin,
and you haven't....

355
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,600
行了！我自己会准备的
Fine!
I'll go ready myself.

356
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,700
他们在讨论什么？
What were they talking about?

357
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,700
他今天晚上要自杀了
He's supposed to sacrifice himself tonight.

358
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,600
- Karris?
- 我试图劝他别这样做
- Karris?
-  I tried to talk him out of it.

359
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,000
如果我们告诉他们关于保护他们村子的防护层的事
If we tell them about the field
that protects their villages

360
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
我正在研究它
但现在我们什么也做不了
I'm working on that,
but we can't do anything

361
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
直到我们能找到处理zpm的方法
until we figure out what to do with the ZPM.

362
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,400
- Rodney，这是个很不好的电话
- 为什么?
- This is a very bad call Rodney
-  Why?

363
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,800
你刚刚告诉我说这个zpm
是他们对付幽灵的防御工事的发动器
You just told me that this ZPM empowers
their defences against the Wraith.

364
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
是啊
Yep.

365
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,600
你没看出来你的偷窃行为的问题？
You don't see the problem with stealing it?

366
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,300
这不是偷
It wouldn't be stealing so much as...

367
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,000
如果对我们有用，我们就可以把它拿来用
Look if it's any good to us,
we can bring them here.

368
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,900
好吧，首先，我们甚至不知道他们有多少人
Alright, for one
We don't even know how many of them there are.

369
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
我怀疑有几百人
Well I highly doubt there'd be more than a few hundred.

370
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,200
什么？
嗨，我们是自己来这的
What?
Hey, we're barely getting by here ourselves

371
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,100
这是个很大的空城
而我们拥有整个大陆
This is a big empty city,
and we have the mainland now.

372
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,900
Rodney, 我们不能来到别的星球
然后把它们的防御设备带走
Rodney, we can't just visit planets,
take away their defences,

373
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
只有它们对我们有用
我们就把它们带回亚特兰帝斯
Look if it's any good to us,
we can bring them here to Atlantis.

374
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,400
如果他们能拥有zpm，我们也可以
If they have a ZPM, yes we can.

375
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,400
哦，天啊，你觉得你在道德上很优越嘛！
Oh my god,
how morally superior you must feel.

376
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,300
伊丽莎白，他们住在树上
Elizabeth, they live in trees.

377
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,800
亚特兰帝斯对他们来说又前进了一大步
Atlantis would be a big step up for them.

378
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,300
而且他们还毫无理由的自杀
Plus they could stop killing
themselves for no good reason.

379
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,700
而且他们还毫无理由的自杀？
Are they killing themselves for no good reason?

380
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,600
是的
电磁场是幽灵不敢侵犯的原因
Yes they are.
The EM shield is what's keeping the Wraith away.

381
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,500
而不是他们的自杀
Not the sacrificing.

382
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,500
好，你说他们的自杀大约始于
Ok, you said that the sacrifices
began at about the same time,

383
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,600
- 那个防御工事生效的时候
- 应该是这样
- you think the shield went online.
-  More or less

384
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,200
那修建这个防御工事的人
So if the people that built the shield
are the same people

385
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,800
是否就是制定这个自杀政策的人
that implemented the suicide pact,

386
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,300
也许这两者并非你想像的那样毫无关连
perhaps the two things aren't
as disconnected as you think.

387
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,100
也许
Maybe.

388
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,900
我只需要再多给我们一天时间
我就会了解得很清楚
One more day, that's all I need.
I'll have a much clearer picture then.

389
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,900
了解什么？
A picture of what?

390
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,400
说来话长，跟着我，我就告诉你
Long story.
Stick around and I'll tell you.

391
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,900
Sheppard，我会很诚实的
I'll be honest with you Sheppard.

392
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,600
再没什么比跟你说话
更让我喜欢的了
There's nothing I'd like more, than to spend more time talking with you.

393
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,400
但不可能
But it's not possible.

394
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,600
如果你们错了呢？
What if you're wrong?

395
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,900
如果一天并不重要呢？
What if a day doesn't matter?

396
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,200
如果一年也不重要呢？
What if a year doesn't matter?

397
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,000
如果重要呢？
And what if it does?

398
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,600
我肯定不会活得很安宁
I'd never rest peacefully knowing that

399
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,800
如果我是导致幽灵来到这个星球的罪魁祸首
I was the reason the Wraith came to this planet.

400
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,500
-你本可以过一个完整的一生
-你是你们星球的一个军人
- You could live a full life.
-  You're a warrior among your people.

401
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,300
被训练用来防卫敌人保护星球了
One who is trained to defend and protect them.

402
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,600
我想可以这么说
I guess you could say that.

403
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,200
如果必要时，你愿意牺牲自己的生命吗？
Would you not willingly give your life
if it were necessary?

404
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,500
如果真正需要的话
It'd have to be really necessary.

405
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,700
那自杀有什么不同？
How is the sacrifice so different?

406
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,000
所以这个规定要一直延续下去，永远
So this is just gonna go on forever.

407
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,900
只要幽灵不回来
As long as the Wraith don't return.

408
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,200
是的
Yes.

409
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,600
你愿意观看吗？
Would you stand witness?

410
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,600
我？
Me?

411
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,300
我需要做点什么吗？
Well what do I have to do.

412
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,500
只要在那就可以了，当我准备好的时候
Just be there as I prepare.

413
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,300
我们从身边的人那里吸取力量
We gather the strength from those close to us,

414
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,400
等待祭祀的来临
for the sacrifice to come.

415
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,800
Weir 博士，坏消息
Dr Weir.
The bad news,

416
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,600
看起来那个装置只能利用M7G677这个唯一的电磁场
is it looks like the device harnesses M7G677 unique electro magnetic field.

417
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,800
很可能对我们没什么用
It probably wouldn't work for us.

418
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,500
我们偷它本来就不对
Assuming we were considering stealing it.

419
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,500
不是这个问题
这个Z.P.M几乎已经坏了
Not much point to that either.
The ZPM is almost depleted.

420
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,400
所以没什么用？
So it's worthless?

421
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,800
不好说，它足够给我们的
I wouldn't say that.
It's enough to give us

422
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,600
防御设备提供几个小时的能量
the shield at full power
for a few hours,

423
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,400
如果幽灵来的话就会有用
which would be handy if
the Wraith were to attack.

424
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,900
如果按照原来的方式它会撑得很久，但是……
Now it can continue what it's being
doing for quite some time but....

425
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,800
所以这对他们比对我们更有用
So it's of more worth to them,
than it is to us.

426
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,600
很可能
Probably.

427
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,400
- 很明显就是这样！
- 好吧
- Definitely!
-  Fine.

428
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,200
-还有件事
-嗯？
- There's another thing.
-  Uh-huh?

429
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,200
我想我可以解释这种自杀行为
I think I have a theory about the suicide pact.

430
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,800
是吗？什么？
Yeah, what is it?

431
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,900
我不知道这个装置启动时有多大能量
I'm not sure how much power
this thing had to start with,

432
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,500
但是建造这个电磁装备的人，
肯定知道它不会撑得太久
but whoever built the EM device,
knew it wouldn't be able to power the field,

433
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,300
如果给整个星球的防御工事供应能量的话
large enough to cover
the whole planet for very long.

434
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,700
所以它是用来保护一小片区域的
So it was built to protect a smaller area.

435
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,300
或者是围绕着这些村庄的区域
More or less,
the area around the villages.

436
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,800
但如果人数太多的话
But if the population
got much larger than they are now,

437
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,100
很可能孩子们就会来到防御工事之外的地方
there's a chance the kids
would move out of the field

438
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,300
成为幽灵的袭击对象
and become susceptible to a Wraith attack.

439
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,000
所以这种自杀规定是一种
So the suicide pact is....

440
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,400
人口控制
Population control.

441
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,900
-哇呜，那就有点严重了
-有点？
-  Wow, that's a little severe.
-  A little?

442
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,400
问题是他们相信
如果他们死于恐惧和战争
The point is that they believe
if they die in fear and turmoil,

443
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,900
他们就不能进入他们自己版本的天堂
they don't get to go to
their version of heaven.

444
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,900
现在他们这么做至少能保证安宁的死去
Now while this, at the very least,
guarantee's that they die in peace,

445
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,800
这是一种，一种宗教
很荒谬的那种
it's a... well it's a religion,
and a pretty ridiculous one at that.

446
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,200
我们没有权利评价他们
Well that's not a judgement
that we can make for them.

447
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,900
没有？
- No?

448
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,300
-没有
- No
- No

449
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,900
我希望你和Ford中尉将这个Z.P.M还回去
No, and I'd like you and Lt Ford
to return the ZPM,

450
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,400
让他们的装置重新运行起来
and get their device back online.

451
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,200
Sheppard, 我是 McKay.
Sheppard, it's McKay.

452
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,100
我是 Teyla
Sheppard少校无法接通话器
This is Teyla.
Major Sheppard is unavailable.

453
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,400
什么意思？
What does that mean?

454
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Karris 邀请他参加净洗仪式
Karris has asked him to take part
in the cleansing ceremony.

455
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,900
- 不是件好事
- 你回来了吗？
- That doesn't sound good.
-  Are you back?

456
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,800
我和Ford回到了古迹那儿
我正要把zpm放回去
Ford and I are back in the old city.
I'm just going to put the ZPM back.

457
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
好，我会告诉Sheppard 少校
Good, I'll let Major Sheppard know.

458
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,900
我把飞船停在电磁场外面
一弄完我们就可以走了
I've parked the Jumper outside the EM field,
so we'll leave as soon as I've finished.

459
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,400
Teyla!
Teyla!

460
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,100
Sheppard 少校发现了一个幽灵的臂镯
已经开始能量传输了
Major Sheppard has found a Wraith bracelet
that has already begun transmitting.

461
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,800
我们需要以最快的速度
恢复电磁场
We need that field returned,
as soon as possible.

462
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,400
阻止它！
Stop him!

463
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,800
对不起，我必须那么做
I'm sorry, I had to do that.

464
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,900
McKay. 我们需要恢复地磁场, 现在!
McKay. We need it on, now!

465
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,000
-快跑！
-我来了
- Move!
-  I'm coming!

466
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,400
-你在等什么？
-应该就是这个
- Well what are you waiting for?
-  That should be it.

467
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,800
-是哪个？
-还好我没引起一场灾难
- That should be what?
-  Far be it for me to cause a panic.

468
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,800
你干什么了？你干什么了？
What did you do? What did you do?

469
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,000
我想我有可能，一念之间毁了它
I think there's the slightest possibility, that in my haste, I might have broken it.

470
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,000
你怎么敢亵渎我们的纪念品？
How dare you defile our remembrance.

471
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,400
-我必须那么做
-必须？
- It was necessary.
-  Necessary?

472
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,700
你违法了这的规矩，必须受到惩罚
You broke the laws, you must be punished.

473
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,800
-这不由你决定，Aries
-也不再由你来决定了
- It's not up to you Aries.
-  Neither is it up to you anymore.

474
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,300
你们有足够的时间
你们修好飞船就滚吧
You've had enough time.
You must fix your ship and go!

475
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,000
他们希望我们拿自己的生命开玩笑开多久？
How long do they expect us
to play chance with our lives?

476
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,900
只要他们中一个人还在我们的村子里
Every second a full grown is in our village,

477
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,200
我们就不能安全的躲过幽灵
is a second we are no longer safe
from the Wraith.

478
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,900
他们必须现在就离开
They must leave now.

479
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,100
我带你们去大井那儿
你们在这不安全
I'll take you to the well.
You're not safe here.

480
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,900
-McKay 和Ford还在森林里
-我们中途去接他们
- McKay and Ford are in the woods.
-  We'll pick them up on the way.

481
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,800
- 他把zpm放回去了吗？
- 没有成功
- Has he put the ZPM back? What did McKay do?
- There's been a setback.

482
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,100
朋友们，别这样！
Friends! Please!

483
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,600
他们已经同意离开了
而且永远不再回来
The full growns have agreed to
leave and never come back.

484
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,500
我会带他们去大井那儿，我一个人去
I will take them to the well, myself.

485
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,000
这一切即将结束
我们可以继续我们的仪式
All this will be over soon,
and we can get on with the ceremony.

486
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,000
确保他们真的回到那儿
Make sure they get there.

487
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,800
告诉我你让它重新启动了
Please tell me you have this working.

488
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
我不知道我干什么了
这玩意平常只是插上去然后运行就可以了
I don't know what I did.
These things just usually plug and play.

489
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,900
-这个装置可能使用另外一个平台
-说简单点
- This device must be using a different window.
- Get to the point.

490
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,800
我是说，安装zpm需要一个程序，但我还没掌握
What I'm saying is, there is a sequence
to installing a ZPM, that I haven't got yet.

491
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,900
这不重要了，你们快点跟我走吧
None of that matters now, just grab
what you can and come with me.

492
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,200
Aries 会派人跟踪我们
Aries will be sending men behind us.

493
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
是什么让臂镯开始接通的？
What made the bracelet start broadcasting?

494
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,200
我想不是我们造成的
I do not think it was anything we did.

495
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,100
很可能是一种警报
就像飞船坠毁时会启动那样
It's possible it was like an emergency beacon
that activated when the dart crashed.

496
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,500
从那以后电磁场的存在让它变得很安静
The EM field's been keeping it quiet ever since.

497
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,700
但Mckay关掉电磁场的时候
它就开始传输信息
It must have begun transmitting
as soon as McKay turned off the field.

498
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,600
听着，我们必须现在就走！
Listen to me.
We have to move on now!

499
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
我们不能那样做
We cannot do that.

500
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,100
Karris, 这很难解释，但我不如果不修好它就哪也不能去
-我们
- Karris, this is hard to explain,
but we can't go anywhere till we fix this device.
- We

501
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,500
你们刚刚扔掉了飞船
如果留在这会有生命危险
You'll just have to abandon your ship.
You're risking your lives if you stay.

502
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,800
这跟我们的飞船无关
This is not about our ship.

503
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,500
这是关于你们村子的防御工事
This is about the protection of your villages.

504
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,400
什么？
What?

505
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,400
Karris, 我们飞船毁坏的原因
Karris, the reason our ship went down.

506
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,600
和当年幽灵船坠毁的原因一样
都是这个装置引起的
The reason the Wraith dart crashed
so long ago, is because of this device.

507
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,600
它屏蔽了所有依赖电磁场的技术
It renders all electro magnetic based
technology inside the shield, inert.

508
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
我不明白
I don't understand.

509
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,900
他们是说幽灵没有入侵
不是因为你们的祭祀
What they're saying is that the Wraith didn't
stay away because of your sacrifices.

510
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,600
而是因为这个防御层
They stayed away because of this shield.

511
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,800
这不是真的
That can't be true.

512
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,100
这全部都是真的
防御层不能保护整个星球
It's not entirely true actually.
The shield doesn't protect the whole planet,

513
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,800
它没有那么多能量
我相信祭祀的主意
it doesn't have enough power.
I believe the idea of the sacrifice,

514
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,700
是让你们的种族不要远离
防御层的保护
was brought in so that your society
never left the confines of the shield.

515
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,600
你瞧，祭祀对于你们的生存确实有重要的作用
但是不是你们所相信的那个原因
Look, the sacrifices play a part in your survival,
but not for the reasons you believe.

516
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,500
不可能
That's impossible.

517
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:11,600
我可以证明给你看
但你必须给我时间，让这个装置恢复正常
I can prove it to you. But you have to give us
time to bring this device back online.

518
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,500
Karris很软弱
我怀疑他不敢献身
Karris is weak.
I doubt his oath to the sacrifice.

519
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,100
那些成年人影响了他的判断力
The full growns have clouded his judgement.

520
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,600
他们还在古迹那儿，并没有离开
They've stopped in the old city and are not moving on.

521
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,100
拿起弓和箭
Get the bows and the spears.

522
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,600
我们现在就把他们驱逐出去
永远不让他们回来
We will rid ourselves of them now,
once and for all!

523
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,800
借过，借过，让一下
Coming through, coming through.
Excuse me.

524
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,500
好吧，再让一下，谢谢
Alright.
And again, still in the way, thankyou.

525
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,400
这肯定没什么用
This will never work.

526
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,300
我们别无选择
We don't have much of a choice.

527
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,400
Karris，这可不是大井
This is not the well, Karris

528
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,900
我的错
It's my fault.

529
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,400
我们刚刚得到McKay的消息
我们的飞船修好了
We just received word from McKay,
that our ship's just been repaired.

530
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,900
事实上，他现在已经在飞船那儿等着我们了
In fact, he's back there right now,
waiting for us.

531
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,300
我们刚刚在和Karris说再见
We were just saying goodbye to Karris.

532
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,500
你觉得我是个傻子吗？
You think I am a fool?

533
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,000
不，我只是觉得你有点猜疑
No. I just think you're a little cranky.

534
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:40,100
看，如果你想让我们去飞船那儿
你可以看着我们离开
Look! If you want to escort us back to the ship,
you can watch us leave.

535
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,700
带路
Lead the way.

536
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,300
哦，你吓到我了
Oh, you scared me!

537
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,200
是你吓到我们了
You scared us!

538
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,900
- 对不起
- 没关系
- I'm sorry.
- That's ok.

539
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,200
我们想过来看看你们有没有留下点巧克力
We came to see if you left any chocolate.

540
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,600
哦，当然留下了
Yes, yes, of course.

541
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,800
什么？
What?

542
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,300
哦，你们想要点巧克力
Oh, you want some.

543
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,600
好，给你们这个
Ok, well you can have this,

544
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,100
但你们要保证让我工作，好吗？
but you gotta promise to let me work ok?

545
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,200
- 好
- 好的
- Ok.
- All right.

546
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,500
安静点
Quietly.

547
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,400
你想留McKay一个人在那儿吗？
Do you intend to leave McKay behind?

548
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,500
我们在周围环绕飞行
直到他修好机器，他会来的
We'll circle around until he get's
the device back on. He'll show up.

549
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,900
太晚了
我们太迟了
It's too late.
We're too late!

550
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,400
那个鬼东西是什么？
What the hell was that?

551
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
它太小，不可能是飞船
It was too small to be a dart.

552
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,500
可能是某种探测器
It was a probe of some kind.

553
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,700
也许是来检查一下幽灵臂镯发出的信号
Probably came to check out the signal
from the Wraith bracelet.

554
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,500
在它回到星门前
我们要把它击落
We have to take it down before
it gets back to the gate.

555
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,200
朋友们？
Boys?

556
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,400
我们要把那个探测器击落
否则会有大麻烦
Let us take that probe down,
or we're all in deep trouble.

557
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,900
即使你们能击落它
也会来更多的
Even if you were able to destroy it,
more will come

558
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,700
不是这样的
That is not true

559
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,300
Sheppard，你认为它们为什么会在这儿？
Why do you think they're here Sheppard?

560
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:19,500
是因为你们，幽灵感觉到了猎物的存在
他们要来狩猎了
You. The Wraith have sensed a crop worth harvesting,
and they've come to claim it.

561
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:28,200
Karris，你告诉他们，我们要把这个东西击落
在它飞回星门之前
Karris, tell them, that we gotta take this thing down,
before it get's back to the Stargate.

562
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,500
还有一个成年人在哪里？
Where's the other full grown?

563
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,800
Aries
Aries,

564
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,400
有一个装置保护我们不受幽灵的袭击
there's a device that shields us
from the machines of the Wraith.

565
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,800
- 祭祀很可能是……
- 他肯定在古迹那儿，走！
- The sacrifices might have been....
-  He'll be in the old city, go!

566
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,700
Aries, 听我说
Aries, listen to me.

567
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,400
Karris，你不敢献身
你将我们都置于危险之中了
You've let your fear of the sacrifice,
put our entire people in danger, Karris.

568
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,700
你们是受到一个防御层的保护
才躲过幽灵的
You have been protected from the Wraith,
by a shield.

569
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,000
我们碰巧把它关闭了
We turned it off by accident.

570
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,500
好消息是如果我们重新启动它
But the good news is,
that if we get it back up,

571
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,600
幽灵就再也不会来了
the Wraith will never come again.

572
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,900
只有一个方法可以确保幽灵不会再来
There's only one thing I have to do,
to make sure the Wraith never come again.

573
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,200
就是杀死你
Kill you.

574
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,900
帮帮忙
Come on.

575
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,600
有人来了
Somebody is coming.

576
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,200
这是什么？
What is this?

577
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,700
- 你必须现在就跟我们走
- 我不能那样做
- You must come with us now!
-  I can't do that.

578
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,100
听着，我需要在这儿完成我的工作
Listen!
I need to finish my work here.

579
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,400
我见过幽灵侵犯别的星球
他们根本不在乎你们有多大
I've seen how the Wraith deal with other planets,
and they don't care how old you are.

580
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,500
我要重新启动这个装置
很快就能完了
I need to get this device turned on,
and I am so close to figuring it out.

581
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,300
给我一点时间吧
So just give me one more shot.

582
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,800
听着，你们俩
回到你们的屋子里去
Look, both of you.
Go to your rooms!

583
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,200
你们不听是吗？
You're not buying this are you?

584
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,600
喂，嘘
过来，过来
Hey, psst.
Come on, come on.

585
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,500
不
No.

586
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,900
长官，我不希望变成这样
Sir.
I don't like where this is headed.

587
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,900
没事的，Ford
Easy Ford.

588
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,600
刚刚没人开枪
Nobody's shooting just yet.

589
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,000
但是……
Yet...

590
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,700
也没有人打算要开枪
And nobody's going to either.

591
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:36,300
Aries, 你根本不知道你们要面临的是什么
Aries, you have no idea
what you're up against here.

592
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,800
我们的武器比你们所见过的要先进很多
The weapons we carry are more powerful
than any you have ever seen.

593
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,900
她说的是实话
She's telling the truth.

594
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,500
它们不仅仅是只能发出大的响动
而且它们能杀死你们
They do more than make a lot of noise,
they will kill you.

595
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,100
它起作用了
It works.

596
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,400
- 当然它能起作用
- 我要告诉Aries，跟我们来
- Of course it works.
- I must tell Aries. Come with us.

597
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,100
嗨，你们还好吗？
Hey, you guys ok?

598
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,600
回村子里去吧
就没事了
Head back to the village,
you're going to be fine.

599
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,600
你们的存在引来了幽灵
Your presence has brought the Wraith.

600
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,500
我们的先人祭祀
你们确破坏了这一切
All our ancestors sacrifices,
you've undone!

601
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,900
这都是因为你们没按我们说的离开这
All because you refused to leave
when you were told to.

602
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,900
并不是那么简单
It's not that simple.

603
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,000
就是那么简单
Yeah it is that simple

604
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,800
- Aries, 不!
- Karris!
- Aries, no!
-  Karris!

605
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,000
- 长官
- 别开枪
- Sir!
- Hold your fire!

606
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,600
看看你做了什么
Look what you've done.

607
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,000
他和你一样有罪
He's as guilty as you are.

608
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,100
Ford?
Ford?

609
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,500
准备好了，长官
Ready sir.

610
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,300
我们要自卫了
We will defend ourselves.

611
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,800
相信我，你们也不想那样
And believe me,
you don't want that.

612
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,300
准备弓箭
Archers ready!

613
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,300
它起作用了
It works!

614
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,800
Aries!
Aries!

615
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,400
它起作用了
It works!

616
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,100
那个装置起作用了
The device works!

617
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,700
他们说的那个装置是真的
我亲眼见了
The device they speak of is real.
I've seen it.

618
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,800
什么？
What?

619
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,800
McKay修好了它
幽灵的鸟从天上掉下来了
McKay fixed it and the Wraith
bird fell right out of the sky.

620
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,200
- 这不重要了
- Aries！它确实有用
- That doesn't matter.
-  Aries! It works.

621
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,500
你没事吧，McKay?
You alright McKay?

622
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,100
我快喘不过气了
Gotta catch my breath.

623
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,000
从飞船里拿药箱来
他会没事的
Get the medical kit from the jumper.
It'll be ok.

624
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,100
如果没有能量增长的话
它能够覆盖50%的区域
Was able to boost the coverage by over
50% without much of a power increase,

625
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:41,500
所以可以让很多人生存
so there should be enough
for a sizeable population growth.

626
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,000
谢谢
Thank you.

627
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,700
但是你也不知道这个防御层能维持多久吗？
But you have no idea how long the shield will last?

628
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:50,400
不知道，很可能等你当爷爷了还能维持
There's no way of knowing, but there's a good
chance you'll be grandparents before it goes.

629
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,600
我们会很愿意经常回来看看你
We'll be happy to come back and check
in on you every now and again.

630
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,500
事实上Ford是很愿意回来解释一下怎么活到25岁的
In fact Ford will be happy to come back
and explain how to be a 25 year old.

631
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,600
- 我等待那一天
- 你们必须习惯一些事情
- I'll look forward to it.
- You'll have to get used to a few things,

632
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,600
既然这儿所有的都改变了
now that everything's changing around here.

633
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,300
但是我们下次来的时候可以讨论这个问题
But we can talk about that next time we visit.

634
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,200
答应我，你要跟着我
Just promise me you'll stick around.

635
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,500
我会的
I will.

636
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,300
所有的村民都同意取消祭祀了吗？
Have all the villages agreed to
suspend the sacrifices?

637
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,700
需要我们改变一些规矩
但是现在……是的
It will require us to change some laws,
but for now.... Yes.

638
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,300
- 长官
- 这个给你
- Sir
- Oh right, here

639
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,100
这是什么？
What's this?

640
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,500
在我们那个星球上
当你长大了1岁就会收到礼物
Well where we're from, you get presents
when you turn a year older.

641
