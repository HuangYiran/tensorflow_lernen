這是恐怖主義行動
This was an act of terrorism.

21
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,790
這是可鄙懦弱的行動

22
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,720
下面為您演奏的

25
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,050
整個事件就發生在我的眼前

26
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,050
而我絲毫沒預料到

該飛機撞向了世貿中心

28

32
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,810
我不是不明真相的那個人
I'm not the one who got it wrong.

33

拿下

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,390
我決定再給我們的婚姻一次機會

47
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,890
他走之前告訴我一些事

48

關于總部炸彈襲擊者的事

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,140
你是說布洛迪
You mean Brody.

50
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,920
不  就是這點  不是他
No, that's just it. It's not him.

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,600
那個襲擊者是唯一可以證明布洛迪清白的人
The bomber's the only way to prove that Brody's innocent.

52
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,680

Carrie, what the fuck are you doing?

53
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,460
卡莉  馬上回去
Carrie, turn around now.

54
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,300
這是對你的最后警告
This is your last warning.

55
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,000
她左上臂受了槍傷
Got a gunshot wound to the upper left bicep.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,610
大出血  可能是射穿動脈了

57
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,570
索爾在他媽什么地方
Where the fuck is Saul?

58
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,280
你醒了
You're awake.

59
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,310
我這是在哪兒
Where am I?

60
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,460
海軍醫院
The Naval Hospital.

61
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,550
你中槍后被他們送了過來
They brought you here after you were shot.

62
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,210
小心點  別把縫線掙開

63

縫了不少針

64
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,530
子彈穿透了身體  沒傷到骨頭
It was a through and through. Missed the bone.

66
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,560

You're lucky.

67
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,520
不  是他槍法準
No, he's just a great shot.

68
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,520
我要在這里待多久

69
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,890
該待多久就待多久
As long as you need to be.

70
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,150
是等我痊愈
For me to heal

71
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,840
還是等中情局想出處理我的辦法
or for the CIA to figure out what to do with me?

72
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,530
這事你得問他們
You'd have to talk to them.

73
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,640
你知道自己懷孕十三周了嗎
Are you aware you're 13 weeks pregnant?

74
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,730
知道
Yes.

75
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,820
孩子應該沒事
The baby should be fine.

76
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,320
如果你想知道的話
In case you're wondering.

77
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,540
瞳孔對光有反應

高壓60  低壓40

79

太他媽低了
Too fucking low.

80
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:30,950
躺下
Lay down.

81
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,530
他在飛機上開始毒癮發作
He started going cold turkey on the flight,

82
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,550
所以他們就用半斤伏特加把他灌暈了
so they knocked him out. With a half pint of Vodka.

83
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,660
一群白癡
Idiots.

84
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,800
脈搏微弱
Pulse is thready.

85
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,940
放松
Take it easy.

86
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,130
我的東西呢  你們這群屌賊
Where's my stuff, you fucking thieves?!

87
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,460
操  把東西還我
Fuck! Where is my stuff?!

88
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,840
冷靜  該死
Calm down, goddamn it!

89
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,170
我的東西呢
Where's my stuff?

90
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,280
別動
Don't move now.

91
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,400
在洛克哈特正式上任前  你還有七天時間
You've got seven days till Lockhart's confirmed.

92
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,470
你覺得這家伙到時能準備好嗎
You think this guy's gonna be ready by then?

93
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,140
我們沒想到他會變成這樣
He's not what we expected...

94
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,120
但他是我們唯一的籌碼
But he's what we've got.

95
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,000
如果他同意合作的話
If he agrees to do it.

96
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,200
他整個一團糟
He's a mess:

97
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,960
貧血
Anemic...

98
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,760
嚴重脫水  可能還得了丙型肝炎
Severely dehydrated, probably Hep C.

99
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,910
無法確認是否感染艾滋病毒
HIV isn't a stretch.

100
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,600
如果你建議送他去醫院  我絕不會答應
If you're suggesting a hospital, it's out of the question.

101
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,930
我肯定能保住他的命
I'm pretty sure I can keep him stable,

102
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,040
可這家伙有毒癮
but the guy's a junkie, sir.

103
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,230
戒斷得多久
How far is he into withdrawal?

104
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,610
很困難
Hardly started.

105
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,300
他現在的情況
What he's feeling now,

106
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,570
會發展到非常可怕的地步
it's gonna get a hell of a lot worse.

107
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,340
美沙酮也許有點用
Methadone would make it easier.

108
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,100
必須完全戒掉
Has to be cold turkey.

109
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,700
無論如何都得讓他正常起來
Where he's going, we need him functional.

110
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,540
不怕搞死他嗎
Even if it kills him?

111
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,800
不會的
It won't.

112
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,810
有你負責保他的命
'Cause you will keep him alive.

113
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,490
懂了嗎
Do you understand?

114
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,630
收到
Sir.

115
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,810
沒事吧
You all right?

116
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,800
別動  你想干嘛
Stop! What are you doing?

117
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,610
我得來一針
I need it!

118
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,410
那邊沒有你要的東西
There's nothing there for you.

119
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,690
-我不行了  -沒有
- No, I need it now! - No.

120
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,040
給我  給我  給我
Damelo! Damelo! Dame...

121
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,670
摁住他
Hey, grab him!

122
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:18,990
針呢
Where's the needle?

123
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,020
來了
Got it.

124
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,510
蓋上他  摁住
Cover him up. Stay down.

125
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,840
求你了
Please...

126
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,120
感覺怎么樣
How are you feeling?

127
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,140
院方說你情況不錯
The doctor says you're progressing nicely.

128
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,580
很快就能起來活動了
You'll be up and walking in no time.

129
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,290
不過  估計不會讓你出病房
Though, not necessarily out of here.

130
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,210
門口還有倆警衛呢
There are two armed guards outside your door.

131
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,220
一系列事件不停地向我展示
You know it never ceases to amaze me

132
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,510
你們多么團結
how you people close ranks.

133
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,080
比如現在
Here you are,

134
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,710
你在中情局外勤任務中被嚴重誤傷
a casualty of some CIA op gone very, very wrong,

135
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,410
基本上成了囚犯
basically a prisoner,

136
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,390
而不知道為什么  我卻成了敵人
and still, somehow, I'm the enemy.

137
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,860
你很清楚
You are aware

138
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,140
中情局人員
that the CIA charter does not include

139
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,760
禁止在本土行動
operations on U.S. soil?

140
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,710
我還在服用鎮痛劑
You know, I'm on painkillers.

141
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,880
基本不明白你的意思
I can barely understand anything you're saying.

142
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,920
好吧
Well...

143
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,670
我一直在看你的檔案
I've been going through your file.

144
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,210
事實上
The fact is,

145
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,130
你需要個靠得住的人
you need someone you can trust.

146
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,690
這話怎么講
And why is that?

147
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,140
你被一槍撂倒  總想問個究竟吧
You're lying there shot and you need to ask?

148
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,520
對你下這狠手那位
The man who did this to you,

149
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,520
馬上就要滾蛋了
he's on his way out.

150
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,730
可我還是想知道
But I need to know...

151
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,460
他什么目的
what's he up to?

152
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,510
問他吧
Ask him.

153
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,940
他跑加拉加斯去干什么
What was he doing in Caracas?

154
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,740
恐怕你還不知道他去那里了吧
You didn't even know he was there, did you?

155
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,600
卡莉那邊又有消息了
I got another message from Carrie.

156
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,080
她徹底冷靜了吧
Is she calming down at all?

157
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,590
恰恰相反
No, the opposite.

158
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,420
洛克哈特議員去找她了
Senator Lockhart just paid her a visit.

159
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,920
他知道我們來加拉加斯了
Somehow, he knows about Caracas.

160
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,800
不可能
It's impossible.

161
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,120
但他知道了
Well, he does.

162
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,300
你認為他懷疑了
You think he suspects?

163
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,310
我確定他根本不知道
I'm sure he doesn't have a clue.

164
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,100
但她知道了
She does now.

165
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,840
那我們怎么辦
So what do we do about that?

166
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,310
老樣子
Same as before;

167
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,380
繼續在醫院看著她
keep her under guard at the hospital.

168
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,770
不能見布洛迪
Away from Brody.

169
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,490
洛克哈特呢
And Lockhart?

170
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,680
真不知道他怎么知道的
I don't know how the hell he found out.

171
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,740
這事只有你知我知
No one knew besides us.

172
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,150
查查我們的家里和辦公室
Have our houses and offices swept.

173
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,610
所有房間都徹底查查
Every room, top to bottom.

174
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,440
什么情況
What happened?

175
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,450
拉了一身
Shat himself.

176
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,990
天吶
Jesus christ.

177
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,600
你們是誰
Who are you?

178
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,350
別說話
Don't talk.

179
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,450
你們軍方的吧
You're soldiers, aren't you?

180
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,690
別說話
Don't talk.

181
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,410
太燙了  燙死了
It's burning! It's burning.

182
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,620
水不熱
It's not hot.

183
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,230
太燙了
It's burning!

184
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,560
這種狀態  甚至更糟的情況還會持續三天
It'll continue as bad as this, or worse, another three days.

185
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,730
然后毒性從機體代謝
And at least a week after that

186
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,270
至少還得一周
before the stuff's out of his system.

187
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,840
就是說得十天了
So you're saying ten days.

188
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,290
我們只有六天
We have six.

189
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,750
另外等他緩過來
Plus, at the end of all this,

190
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,980
肯定跟只慫貓一樣了
he's gonna be weak as a fuckin' kitten.

191
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,800
還有個辦法
There is another option.

192
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,290
什么
What?

193
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,920
伊菠因
Ibogaine.

194
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,190
一種尼日利亞植物中的萃取物
It's a drug based on a Nigerian plant.

195
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,810
它可以極大地加速戒毒進程
It dramatically accelerates the withdrawal process

196
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,020
并徹底戒除毒癮
and kills the addiction.

197
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,300
副作用很厲害
The side effects are brutal,

198
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,810
所以在這里是非法的
which is why it's outlawed here.

199
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,600
惡心  嘔吐  產生一些幻覺
Nausea, vomiting, some hallucinations.

200
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,000
暴力的  讓人精神錯亂的幻覺
Violent, mind-bending hallucinations.

201
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,700
有用嗎
Does it work?

202
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,730
有用
It does.

203
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,740
相信我
Take my word.

204
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,350
從蒙特祖瑪的大廳
From the halls of Montezuma

205
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:10,140
到的黎波里的海岸
to the shores of Tripoli

206
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,420
在空中  在陸地  在海洋
We fight our country's battles

207
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,860
我們為祖國而戰
in air, on land and sea...

208
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,710
說話  你這混蛋
Say something, you motherfucker.

209
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,990
別光是站在那兒
Don't just stand there.

210
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,270
說話
Say something...

211
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,660
先是為了權利與自由而戰
First to fight for right and freedom

212
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,450
讓我們的榮譽干干凈凈
and to keep our honor clean

213
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,970
我們驕傲的宣稱
We are proud to claim the title

214
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,330
我們是美國海軍陸戰隊
of United States marine.

215
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,520
我們是美國海軍陸戰隊
Of United States marine.

216
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,270
天吶
God...

217
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,900
天吶
God...

218
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,900
天吶
God...

219
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,220
滾開
Get out.

220
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,740
滾開
Get out!

221
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,700
你他媽給我吃了什么
What the fuck did you give me?!

222
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,760
不
No...

223
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,650
把那個給我
Give me that!

224
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,620
[阿語]

225
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,820
[阿語]

226
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,640
放開我
Get off me!

227
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,060
放開
Get off!

228
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,360
[阿語]

229
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
放開我  不
Get off me, no!

230
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,700
[阿語]

231
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,080
他現在會睡著
He'll sleep now.

232
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,630
一會兒
For a while.

233
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,570
也許我們應該用固話打給索爾
Maybe we should just call Saul's landline,

234
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,600
啟動語音激活
trigger the voice activation,

235
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,530
復查我們的跟蹤程序
double-check our tracking program.

236
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,640
我們可以
We could.

237
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,050
但是
But...?

238
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:02,960
這棟房子租給了
This house is leased to

239
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,700
特拉維夫的一個航運集團
a shipping consortium out of Tel Aviv.

240
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,280
我覺得背后肯定有摩薩德的影子
It's got Mossad written all over it.

241
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,460
是  但如果就只是個監控臺
Yeah, but what if it's just a monitoring station,

242
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,800
或是情報傳送點呢
or a dead drop?

243
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,640
那我們就他媽的是在浪費時間
Then we're wasting our fucking time.

244
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,090
你看到了嗎
Are you gettin' this?

245
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,360
你還活著
You're alive.

246
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,810
不是什么好事
That wasn't a given.

247
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,740
想喝水嗎
Want some water?

248
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,420
為什么不把我留在那里自生自滅呢
Why couldn't you have just left me there to die?

249
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,350
我你知道我不能那么做
I think you know that wasn't really an option.

250
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,560
所以
So...

251
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,700
現在怎么辦
...What now?

252
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,510
那取決于你
That'll be up to you.

253
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,120
審訊嗎
A trial?

254
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,710
但不是我干的
'cause I didn't do it.

255
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,720
你是在說中情局的爆炸嗎
You talking about bombing the CIA?

256
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,980
我想要相信你的說法
I'm inclined to agree.

257
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,580
但你的罪行不是在那里開始或結束的
But your transgressions don't begin or end there.

258
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,610
我不打算糾結那件事
And I'm not about to engage in a back and forth

259
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,760
某種程度上你也是受害者
where you somehow end up the victim.

260
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,280
我們都知道你做了什么
We both know what you've done.

261
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,620
我們都知道你是什么人
We both know what you are.

262
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,960
一個給自己挖下無底深坑的人
A man who's dug himself into a hole so deep,

263
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,610
常識會告訴你已經無路可逃了
common sense'd tell you there's no way out.

264
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,890
但我要告訴你  也許還有路
I am telling you, though, that there might be.

265
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,510
怎么辦
How?

266
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,720
我給你提供一個機會
I'm offering you a chance

267
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,870
再次成為一個陸戰隊員
to be a marine again.

268
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,200
成為那個
The man you were...

269
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,020
被他們毀掉之前的人
...before they broke you.

270
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,560
求求你
Please.

271
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,860
不要再來了
No more.

272
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,300
我已經完蛋了
I'm done.

273
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,010
你沒有
You are not.

274
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,720
你會做這最后一件事
You will do this one last thing.

275
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,220
不
No.

276
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,500
殺了我吧
So kill me.

277
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,960
現在就殺了我
Kill me now.

278
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,240
你想死嗎
You want to die, huh?

279
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,330
我們等著瞧
We'll see about that.

280
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,290
把他丟下船
Put him overboard.

281
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,410
去他媽的  我要下去
Fuck this shit. I'm going in.

282
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,200
不要  他會上來的
Don't. He'll come up.

283
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,050
我不信
I don't believe this.

284
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,100
操  我們快下去
Fuck it. Let's go.

285
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,460
拉住他
Pull him...

286
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,700
他像塊石頭一樣沉下去了
He went down like a stone.

287
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,900
完全沒有求生的欲念
No attempt to save himself whatsoever.

288
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,560
現在他絕食了
Now he's refusing to eat.

289
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,660
喂他吃
Make him.

290
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,110
你打算讓我們怎么辦到
How do you expect us to do that?

291
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,300
強制喂食不會嗎
It's called force-feeding.

292
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,420
恕我直言  長官
All due respect, sir,

293
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,800
這家伙就是個廢人
the guy's a waste of space.

294
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,090
我建議你們  無論對他有什么想法
Now, I suggest whatever you've got in mind for him,

295
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,000
六個月后再說吧
just push it six months.

296
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,530
讓我們來好好處理
Let us do this thing right.

297
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,250
你那堆推心置腹的廢話說完了嗎
You done letting us in on your thought process?

298
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,130
是的  長官
Yes, sir.

299
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,910
喂他吃飯
Get him to eat.

300
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,740
他說得對
He's right, you know.

301
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,110
我們的時間不多了
Our window's closing fast.

302
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,050
勿失良機  索爾
It's now or never, Saul.

303
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,370
你感覺怎么樣
How you feeling?

304
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,470
好像你真的關心一樣
As if you actually cared.

305
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,360
我在這兒有時間思考
You know, I've had time to think here.

306
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,820
我不斷地回想事實
And I keep coming back to the fact

307
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,110
如果沒有你的許可
that this bullet in my shoulder

308
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,490
我肩膀里絕不會有這顆子彈
would never have happened without your okay.

309
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,300
你當時的舉動會連累整個任務
You were about to compromise the mission.

310
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,240
我是想證明布洛迪的清白
I was about to clear Brody.

311
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,820
你說過你會支持的
You said you were behind that.

312
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,520
證明布洛迪的清白
"Clear Brody."

313
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,100
那意味著什么
What does that even mean?

314
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,960
所以你騙了我
So you lied to me.

315
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,770
我以為你不想去那兒
I don't think you want to go there--

316
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,760
到底是誰騙誰
who lied to whom.

317
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,110
布洛迪偷偷溜出境
Brody slipping out of the country

318
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,670
與此同時  你不省人事長達14小時
while you were unconscious for 14 hours.

319
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,440
你覺得我會相信嗎
You think I believed that for a second?

320
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,580
你知道我當時在加拉加斯  你該給我留言的
You know I was in Caracas, you should left me a message.

321
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,330
你不想知道他的近況嗎
Don't you want to know how he is?

322
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,620
他怎么樣
How is he?

323
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,160
不怎么樣
He's not well.

324
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,820
你對他做了什么
What did you do to him?

325
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,460
這個這個問題背后的推測
You know, the assumptions behind that question

326
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,870
充滿偏見  嚇到我了
are so misguided, it frightens me.

327
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,800
我發現他時  情況已然很糟
I found him in a bad way.

328
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,070
相信我
Believe me.

329
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,280
我不想這樣
It wasn't something I wanted.

330
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,070
他在哪兒
Where is he?

331
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,620
弗吉尼亞州
In Virginia.

332
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,880
奈克壩基地
At Dam Neck.

333
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,390
我找了一個特別行動小組幫助他康復
Got a special ops team trying to get him in shape.

334
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,380
康復之后呢
In shape for what?

335
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,090
我正想和你談這個
That's what I wanted to talk about.

336
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,300
我設了個局
I have a play.

337
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,330
牽涉到了布洛迪
It involves Brody.

338
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,240
我希望你能說服他
And I'm hoping you'll convince him.

339
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,980
這關乎到所有人的利益
It's in everyone's interest.

340
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,770
你告訴過我賈瓦迪是個局
You told me Javadi was the play.

341
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,980
他是
He is.

342
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,020
布洛迪是下一步
Brody's the next phase.

343
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,900
你為什么需要我
And you need me why?

344
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,580
我猜他已經拒絕你了
I'm assuming he already turned you down.

345
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,830
我們還沒到那一步
We didn't get that far.

346
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,510
正如我所說  他情況不好
Like I said, he's not well.

347
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,520
什么局  你有什么好主意
So, what is it? What's your big idea?

348
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,480
達尼什·阿克巴里
Darnish Akbari.

349
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,040
伊朗革命衛隊的首領
Head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.

350
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,200
對
Right.

351
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,350
賈瓦迪的上司
Javadi's boss.

352
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,700
他還是和平的最大障礙
And the single greatest impediment to peace.

353
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,970
我想除掉他
I want him gone.

354
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,990
祝你好運
Well, good luck with that.

355
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,730
布洛迪能接觸到他
Brody can get to him.

356
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,010
怎么接觸
How?

357
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,600
作為中情局炸彈襲擊者
As the Langley bomber.

358
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,760
布洛迪去那兒尋求政治庇護
Brody seeks political asylum there.

359
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,130
和阿克巴里會面  干掉他
Gets an audience with Akbari, takes him out.

360
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,530
賈瓦迪繼承他的衣缽
Javadi's the heir apparent.

361
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,790
他會掌權
He ascends the throne,

362
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,190
然后從伊朗最重要人物前二十
and he goes from being one of the 20 most important people

363
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,300
轉變為前三
in Iran to one of three.

364
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,590
不過他是我們的人
Only he's working for us.

365
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,150
布洛迪干掉他
Brody takes him out?

366
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,220
是的
Yes.

367
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,250
拜托  索爾  你胃口太大了
Come on, Saul, you're reaching.

368
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,500
阿克巴里的安保措施比阿亞圖拉還嚴密
Akbari's better protected than the Ayatollah.

369
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,180
布洛迪陷入困境總能絕處逢生
Brody's got a knack for getting into tight places.

370
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,890
他之前就做到過
He's done it before.

371
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,930
那充其量就是個自殺性任務
At best it's a suicide mission.

372
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,030
不  他在外面有一個團隊
No, he'll have a team on the ground.

373
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,840
你想讓我說服他這么做
And you expect me to convince him of this?

374
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,440
我希望你能好好考慮
I expect you to consider deeply

375
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,670
讓美國線人打入伊朗權力金字塔的最頂端
the upside of placing a U.S. asset at the very top of

376
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,510
所帶來的益處
the Iranian food chain.

377
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,130
這是我希望的
That's what I expect.

378
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,520
賈瓦迪不僅會是情報來源
Javadi won't be just an intelligence source.

379
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,330
他會控制著
He'll be in control

380
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,610
整個伊朗安全機構
of the entire Iranian security apparatus.

381
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,420
那也不意味著他會洗心革面或是裝死
That doesn't mean he'll roll over and play dead.

382
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,270
我知道
I know.

383
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,440
但他可以做些什么
But he can do something.

384
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,670
從而打破僵局
Something to break the logjam.

385
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,000
無需再挑起另一場戰爭
Something besides another war.

386
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,470
并將改變既成的事實
Something that'll change the facts on the ground.

387
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,210
這就足夠了
Just enough.

388
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,230
兩個國家已經有三十多年
So two countries that haven't been able to communicate

389
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,780
都沒能進行交流了
for over 30 years

390
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,480
只有通過恐怖主義行動和威懾行為
except through terrorist actions and threats...

391
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,040
才能坐下來談談
...can sit down and talk.

392
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,880
計劃就是這樣  卡莉
That's the play, Carrie.

393
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,590
難道這不值得你付出寶貴時間嗎
Tell me it's not worth your time.

394
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,790
布洛迪  我想告訴你
Brody, I want you to know

395
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,110
我今天才知道你在這里
that I didn't know you were here until today.

396
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,960
我一聽到消息就馬上趕來了
I came as soon as I heard.

397
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,290
如果我有什么能幫到你  就跟我說
Tell me if there's anything I can do for you.

398
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,090
什么事都行
Anything.

399
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,110
你要他在什么時候準備好
When do you need him ready by?

400
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,400
這個月的二十七號
27th of this month.

401
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,840
怎么這么急
Why so soon?

402
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,840
那天是洛克哈特參議員
It's the day Senator Lockhart's

403
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,720
任職聽證開始的日子
confirmation hearings begin.

404
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,300
是啊
Right.

405
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,940
告訴我他在加拉加斯遇到了什么事
Tell me what happened to him in Caracas.

406
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,980
就我們了解  簡直一團糟
A world of shit as far as we know.

407
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,880
他在哥倫比亞邊境腹部中彈
He was gut-shot at the Columbian border.

408
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,200
差點送了命
Nearly died.

409
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,840
我猜還對止痛藥上癮了吧
Got hooked on the painkillers, I guess.

410
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,870
有個清真寺里也出了事
There was also an incident at a mosque.

411
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,010
一位伊瑪目和他的妻子被殺
An imam and his wife were murdered.

412
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,400
都因為他嗎
Because of him?

413
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,760
就因為他
Because of him.

414
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,570
我需要一輛車
I need a vehicle.

415
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,760
你的胳膊怎么了
What happened to your arm?

416
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,910
玩懸掛滑翔摔的
Hang gliding accident.

417
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,050
真的假的
For real?

418
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,470
去他媽的中情局  巴拉茲
Fucking CIA, Baraz.

419
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,310
你有什么好問她的
What are you asking her questions for?

420
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,550
就隨便聊聊
Just making conversation.

421
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,790
下個路口左轉
It's the next left.

422
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,310
現在怎么辦
What now?

423
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,660
我們等著
Now we wait.

424
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,250
我們盯了這座房子二十四小時
We sat on the house for 24 hours.

425
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,930
出入過的就只有這個人
And this is the only person who ever came in or out.

426
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,820
天吶
Oh, Christ.

427
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,270
你認識他嗎
You know him?

428
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,460
恐怕是的
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

429
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,300
他是什么人
Who is he?

430
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,660
我妻子的一個朋友
A friend of my wife's.

431
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,000
他叫阿倫·伯納德
His name is Alain Bernard.

432
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,530
他們在孟買認識的
She met him in Mumbai.

433
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,750
他們在那邊有過一段關系
They struck up a relationship there,

434
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,140
后來還有沒有繼續就不知道了
which may or may not be ongoing.

435
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,890
我也不想問這個  索爾
I hate to ask this, Saul,

436
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,660
不過  你覺得米拉知道嗎
but do you think Mira's aware?

437
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,710
他是以色列情報人員這事嗎
That he's an Israeli intelligence officer?

438
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,900
不知道
No.

439
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,230
迷戀上這家伙是她唯一的罪過
Falling for the guy is her only crime.

440
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,630
你想讓我做什么
What do you want me to do?

441
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,050
現在嗎
For the time being?

442
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,920
抓住他
Pick him up,

443
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,120
把他丟進地洞里關著去
put him in a dark fucking hole.

444
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,030
那洛克哈特呢
What about Lockhart?

445
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,030
他在其中扮演什么角色
How does he fit into the equation?

446
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,100
我大概漏了一條線索
I think I buried a lead.

447
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,330
什么意思
Meaning what?

448
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,490
這家伙離開安全屋以后
After our guy left the safe house,

449
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,290
我跟蹤他到了彼得餐廳
I followed him to Pete's Diner,

450
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,780
在國會山
Capitol Hill.

451
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,910
丹娜
Dana?

452
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,690
丹娜  丹...
Dana? Dan...

453
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,710
你們這群混蛋  讓我出去
Hey, assholes, let me out!

454
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,370
布洛迪
Brody...

455
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,630
放開我
Get off me!

456
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,760
天吶
Oh...God...

457
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,590
-放我出去  -放松
- Let me the hell out! - Relax!

458
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,590
布洛迪
Brody!

459
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,640
混賬東西
Motherfucker!

460
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,220
丹娜  是我
Dana, it's me!

461
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,240
丹娜
Dana!

462
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,710
-回去  -放開我
- Get back... - Get off of me!

463
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,020
丹娜
Dana!

464
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,020
媽的  丹娜
Fuck. Dana!

465
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,710
她聽不見的  布洛迪
She can't hear you, Brody.

466
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,810
你這個賤人
You...you bitch.

467
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,120
你這個臭婊子
You fucking bitch.

468
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,960
-他在嗎  -您做預約了嗎
- Is he in? - Is he expecting you?

469
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,350
先生  您不能進去
Sir, you can't go in there.

470
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,010
反正那晚我還要招待一位籌款人
I'm hosting a fund-raiser that night anyway.

471
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,080
我得掛了
Listen, I got to go.

472
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,600
搞什么鬼  索爾
What the hell, Saul?

473
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,630
這是什么東西
What is this?

474
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,000
打開它
Open it.

475
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,370
你能解釋一下嗎
Care to explain?

476
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,920
阿倫·伯納德為《世界報》寫了一篇我的簡介
Alain Bernard is writing a profile on me for Le Monde.

477
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,540
二十分鐘之前
20 minutes ago,

478
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,360
阿倫·伯納德承認自己是以色列情報人員
Alain Bernard admitted to being an asset of Israeli intelligence.

479
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:24,270
這與我有關嗎  怎么了
And I should be concerned about this... Why?

480
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,430
他聲稱自己曾經將一系列從我家中
Because he claims he passed you information obtained

481
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,130
竊聽到的信息告知于你
from a listening device planted in my home.

482
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,120
扯淡
That's preposterous.

483
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,420
是嗎
Is it?

484
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,830
我一通電話打給貝納永大使
One call to ambassador Benayoun,

485
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:44,000
這馬上就會成為一次國際事件
It would be an international incident.

486
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,180
再一通電話打給《華盛頓郵報》
A second call to The Post,

487
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:49,390
你的照片馬上就能登上
and your picture'd be on the front page

488
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,170
全國報紙的頭版頭條
of every newspaper in the country.

489
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,050
你想怎樣
What do you want?

490
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,310
我想要時間
Time.

491
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,210
時間
Time?

492
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:06,990
只要你把就任局長一事
Postpone your confirmation

493
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,650
推遲到下月中旬
until the middle of next month,

494
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,360
我可以保證這些信息不曝光
and these'll never see the light of day.

495
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,740
我沒搞懂
I don't understand.

496
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,810
這只是個簡單的請求而已
It's a simple request.

497
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,200
再給我幾周時間
Give me a few more weeks.

498
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,730
我不是這個意思
That's not what I meant.

499
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,710
你可以借機一舉打垮我
You could destroy me with this.

500
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,060
繼續穩坐局長一職
You could guarantee your own tenure as director.

501
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,190
為什么要放我一馬
Why are you letting me off the hook?

502
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,030
因為我不想讓我的妻子蒙羞  參議員
Because it would humiliate my wife, senator.

503
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,850
況且這也會讓中情局的名聲掃地
And because it would damage the agency badly.

504
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,430
同意嗎
We have a deal?

505
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,260
成交
We do.

506
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,430
希望你已經可以平心靜氣地跟我談談了
I was hoping you've calmed down enough to talk.

507
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,350
丹娜怎么會在那么偏僻的地方
What's Dana doing cleaning motel rooms

508
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,980
-打掃汽車旅館  -怎么了
- in the middle of nowhere? - Why?

509
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,520
這有什么問題嗎
Is something wrong with that?

510
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,910
-做個鐘點工  -這他媽不是重點
- Being a maid? - There's nothing Wrong with that,

511
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:27,890
我就是想知道
goddamn it, I just want to know

512
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,520
我女兒到底怎么了
what's going on with my daughter!

513
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,010
先喝點水  然后我們再談丹娜
Drink it, and I'll tell you about Dana.

514
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,630
慢點喝  不然會惡心
Slowly, or you'll be sick.

515
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,800
好了
There.

516
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,330
到底怎么回事
Now, what's going on?

517
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,360
她這段日子過得不好  布洛迪
Well, she's had a rough time, Brody.

518
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,560
她輟學了
She dropped out of school.

519
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,640
搬到外面去住
She moved out of the house.

520
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,520
還改了自己的姓
She changed her last name.

521
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,610
帶我回那個汽車旅館
Take me back to the motel.

522
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:21,340
不可能
That's not gonna happen.

523
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,690
看在上帝的份上  卡莉
For Christ's sake, Carrie.

524
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:23,690
我告訴過你
I told you.

525
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,060
如果你想再見她一面
If you want to see her again...

526
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,500
別再耍我了  卡莉
Quit your fucking games, Carrie!

527
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,000
我要直視她的雙眼
I need to look her in the eye.

528
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,390
告訴她我是無辜的
I want her to know I'm innocent!

529
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,120
你要是一直吼的話  那我們就沒必要談了
If you keep yelling, this conversation is over.

530
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,390
我想讓這兩個人出去  你能乖乖的嗎
Now I would like to tell these two men to leave, can I do that?

531
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,780
你想怎樣
What do you want?

532
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,180
跟索爾·貝倫森的要求一樣對吧
The same thing as Saul Berenson, I'm guessing.

533
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,020
什么重歸海軍陸戰隊的鬼話
Some bullshit about me being a marine again?

534
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,590
那你想怎樣  布洛迪
What do you want, Brody?

535
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,850
你一直夢寐以求的是什么
What have you always wanted?

536
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,180
一個贖罪的機會
A chance at redemption.

537
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,980
我再說最后一遍  卡莉
For the last time, Carrie.

538
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,340
炸彈不是我放的
I didn't do the bombing.

539
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,610
就算別人不知道  你也該知道
You of all people should know that.

540
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,430
我說的不是炸彈襲擊案
I'm not talking about the bombing.

541
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:31,080
而是自殺式炸彈背心
I'm talking about the suicide vest.

542
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:36,280
我說的是伊麗莎白·蓋恩斯之死
I'm talking about the death of Elizabeth Gaines

543
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:39,630
還有國務院外的兩名特勤局特工
and those two secret service agents outside the State Department.

544
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:46,440
以及加拉加斯的伊瑪目和他妻子遇害
I'm talking about what happened to that imam and his wife in Caracas.

545
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,370
照索爾說的做
Do what Saul is asking.

546
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,570
-你希望我怎么做  -我希望你
- What you're asking? - All right, what I'm asking.

547
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,830
就算不為自己  也為丹娜考慮
If not for your sake, then for Dana's.

548
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,520
否則的話  即使告訴她你是無辜的
Otherwise, telling her you're innocent is just...

549
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,310
也不過是又一個謊言
...is just one more lie.

550
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,440
瞧我這幅樣子  卡莉
Look at me, Carrie.

551
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,530
你現在讓我出去買包煙都成問題
You couldn't send me out for a pack of cigarettes right now.

552
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,830
我們會幫你做好準備
We'll get you ready.

553
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,770
但要你愿意配合才行
You just have to be willing.

554
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,700
瞧是誰跑出來玩了
Well, look who's come out to play.

555
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,950
也該出來了
About fucking time.

556
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:00,900
征得你媽同意了嗎
Did you get mommy's permission?

557
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,850
大伙都給我閉嘴
Hey, shut the fuck up, everybody.

558
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,280
沿著這邊跑
We're going this way.

559
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,570
準備好了嗎
You ready?

560
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,380
快點
Come on.

561
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,550
站起來
On your feet.

562
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,210
別動  他得靠自己
No. He needs to do it by himself.

563
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,730
什么時候能繼續跑
Tell me when you're good to go again.

564
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:58,540
就現在
Now.

565
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,750
跟上
Go.

566
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,480
十六天后

567
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,750
找到莫桑比克馬普托市
Find Maputo, Mozambique.

568
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,910
接收頻率是多少
What's the frequency?

569
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:32,140
3265千赫
Khz 3265.

570
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,930
當地人用什么語言交流
What language are they speaking?

571
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,240
葡萄牙語

梅花八
Eight of clubs.

574
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,190
紅桃十
Ten of hearts.

575
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,430
黑桃J
Jack of spades?

576
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,830
拼出她的姓
Spell her last name.

577
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:05,360
B-a-c-z-e-w-s-k-i  比謝夫斯基
Uh, b-a-c-z-e-w-s-k-i. Baczewski.

578
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,240
這上面說她比誰還火辣
It says here she's hotter than what?

579
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,180
-喬治婭·阿斯法特  -誰說的
- Georgia Asphalt? -And who said that?

580
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,580

583
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,890
全中
Fucking-a right.

584
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,750
你和她之間有什么故事
So, you guys got something going on?

585
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:33,130
沒有
No.

586
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,360
得了吧
Come on, man,

587
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,310
從她打量你的眼神就能看出端倪
I've seen the way she's checking you out

588
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,810
你當時沒在看她
when you're not looking.

589
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,940
真的沒什么
There's nothing.

590
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,290
真的
Seriously?

591
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,570
真的
Seriously.

592
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,530
這么說你不介意
So, you don't mind if I...

593
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,170
我去泡她嘍
If I hit that shit then, right?

594
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,400
你看  還說沒什么
See? There is something.

595
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,690
我就知道
I knew it.

596
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,310
真的沒什么  真的
No, go ahead. Really.

597
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:57,310
我只是和你開玩笑
Nah, man, I'm just fucking with you.

598

是個男孩
It's a boy.

601
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,780
他叫德文
Name's Devon.

602
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,160
你怎么從來沒說過
How come I didn't know that?

603
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,870
因為我
Just...

604
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,040
不太愿意談及我的家庭
I don't like talking about my family.

605
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,500
迷信使然
Superstitious.

606
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,450
五分鐘后開會
Hey, we're on in five.

607
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:25,800
在簡報室
In the briefing room.

608
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:32,280
這一帶區域的伊朗巡邏隊并非全天候執勤
Iranian patrols in the area are intermittent.

609
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,890
但訓練有素  裝備精良
But they are well-trained and equipped.

610
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,430
此外  離這里七十英里處的畢扎爾
Also, there is also an IRIAF base

611
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:39,360
是伊朗的空軍基地
in Bijar, 70 miles away,

612
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,350
換句話說  隨時可以調配空中火力支持
Which means they can call in air support.

613
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:42,800
他們都有什么飛機
What kind of planes are we talking?

614
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,550
有幾架是第一次海灣戰爭時期
Uh, some French-built F-1 Mirages impounded

615
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,350
從伊拉克收繳的法國F-1幻影戰斗機
from Iraq after the First Gulf War

616
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,030
還有六架中國制造的蘇24戰斗機
and six Chinese Su-24s.

617
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:50,930
不好意思  可以回到剛才的問題嗎
Excuse me, can we back up a minute?

618
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:52,060
可以
Sure.

619
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,660
他們押送我至邊境處
The guys gets me to the border...

620
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:54,900
然后我示意投降
where I surrender myself?

621
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,020
沒錯
Correct.

622
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,160
選擇馬里萬郡是因為很多基地組織指揮官
We chose Marivan because several Al-Qaeda commanders

623
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,350
同樣在那里尋求政治庇護
also asked for political asylum there.

624
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,130
之后呢  等人空載我去德黑蘭
What happens then? I get flown to Tehran?

625
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,470
經過一段時間審查之后  我們預期中是這樣的
After a period of vetting, yeah, that's our expectation.

626
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:10,520
好的  你憑什么認為我能夠接近
Okay, but what makes you think I'll ever get close enough

627
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,680
阿克巴里將軍并刺殺成功
to General Akbari to take him out?

628
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,970
你將受到革命英雄的待遇
You'll be treated as a hero of the revolution.

629
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,330
很多高級官員  比如將軍
The senior members of the regime, like the general,

630
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,070
會迫不及待想利用你的宣傳價值
want to take advantage of your propaganda value.

631
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,570
而且賈瓦迪將作為引薦人
Plus Javadi's on the ground

632
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,640
安排你和將軍的會面
to facilitate a meeting between the two of you.

633
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,300
可如果不知道暗殺行動結束的地點或時間的話
But if we don't know where or when the assassination goes down...?

634
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,860
你是在擔心撤離計劃
You're concerned about our extraction plan.

635
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:31,160
你想知道任務完成之后  如何全身而退
How we're gonna get you out of there once it's done?

636
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,420
是的
Yeah.

637
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,490
我正準備說
I was just getting to that.

638
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:36,870
你一進入邊境
Once you're inserted at the border,

639
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:37,900
隨行隊伍里的四名人員
four members of your team

640
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,220
會沿路南上儂得衫
will continue south to Nodesheh,

641
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,680
之后翻山越嶺  穿過平原
where they cross the mountains and make their way overland

642
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,010
行軍至拉溫莎
to Lavasan,

643
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,430
德黑蘭外圍的一個小城市
a small city just outside Tehran.

644
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,930
那里有當地的反叛組織
Opposition groups there have provided us

645
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:50,360
提供的安全屋
with a safe house.

646
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,980
我們領先一步
We've already gone ahead

647
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,560
安全衛星通信設備已安裝完畢
and put in secure satcom.

648
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,460
碰頭暗號是
Our code there is...

649
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,260
[波斯語]

650
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,950
[波斯語]

651
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:19,620
你從什么時候開始抽煙的
Since when do you smoke?

652
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,910
我不抽
I don't.

653
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,780
我沒在抽
I'm not.

654
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,880
我只是裝個樣子
It just looks like I'm smoking.

655
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,190
就當沒發生過
There. It never happened.

656
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,410
你什么也沒看見
You saw nothing.

657
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,660
什么也沒有
Nothing.

658
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:40,680
話說...
Look...

659
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,310
我照你說的做了
I did what you asked.

660
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:44,000
我按你的意愿行事
I'm doing what you want.

661
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,420
現在該帶我去見丹娜了
Now you told me you'd take me to see Dana again.

662
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,030
我是說等你回來以后
I meant after you get back.

663
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:51,310
算了吧  卡莉
Come on, Carrie.

664
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,620
你我都知道此行兇多吉少
We both know that's a long shot.

665
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:58,420
這么多風雨都熬過來了
We made it this far.

666
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,310
這倒是
That's true.

667
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:07,660
我承認  我有過懷疑
I admit, I had my doubts.

668
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,790
所以你才刻意保持距離吧
Is that why you've kept your distance?

669
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,080
沒關系的
Hey, it's fine.

670
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,480
這是你的權利
You're entitled.

671
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,990
六個小時后你就要出發了
You're loading out in six hours.

672
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:28,300
我不知道能否及時把你送回基地
I'm not sure I can get you off the base and back in time.

673
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,200
不見到丹娜  我是不會走的
Well, I'm not leaving until I see Dana again.

674
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,370
在119號房間
It's there. 119.

675
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:58,500
布洛迪  有些事我得告訴你
Brody, there's something you need to know.

676
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,570
在丹娜更改姓氏
Before she changed her name,

677
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:03,920
離家出走之前...
before she left home...

678
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:09,000
她在醫院待過一陣
Dana was hospitalized.

679
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:12,680
在爆炸案發生后兩周后...
About two weeks after the bombing...

680
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,620
她曾企圖自殺
she tried to kill herself.

681
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:46,880
誰啊
Who is it?

682
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,500
丹娜  是我
Dana, it's me.

683
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,230
是爸爸
It's your dad.

684
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:48,830
你是怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

685
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,230
有卡莉幫忙
Carrie.

686
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:02,800
我能進去嗎
Can I come in?

687
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:09,800
拜托了  丹娜
Dana, please?

688
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,510
謝謝
Thank you.

689
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:32,610
我一定得見你
I had to see you.

690
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:36,870
好吧
Okay.

691
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,180
你見到了
You have.

692
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:45,840
親愛的  我真的很抱歉
Oh, my baby, I'm so sorry.

693
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:49,630
沒這個必要
Don't be.

694
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,600
你現在過得還好嗎
How are you now?

695
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,330
你到底來干什么
Why are you here?

696
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,180
我只是想告訴你  
I just wanted to tell you that

697
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,330
那些人指責我干的那些事情  都不我干的
all those things those people said I did, I didn't do.

698
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,230
好的
Fine.

699
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:16,490
好的  很好
Fine, good.

700
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,670
那些人不是我殺的
I didn't kill all those people.

701
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,590
不是我
It wasn't me.

702
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,160
不是我干的
I didn't do it.

703
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,920
我馬上要走了
And I have to leave soon.

704
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,100
幾個小時候后就走
In a few hours.

705
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,440
我只是想在臨走前見見你
But I just wanted to see you before I go.

706
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,850
你見到了
You did.

707
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:53,580
你就從來沒想過
Did you ever, for one second,

708
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,500
我是不是想見到你呢
think about if I wanted to see you?

709
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,370
你想聽我說什么
What do you want to hear?

710
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,130
說你是好爸爸嗎
That you were a good dad?

711
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:10,820
無論發生什么事  都沒關系嗎
That despite everything, it's all okay?

712
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,450
你想讓我說什么
What do you want me to say?

713
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,570
這樣吧
Look...

714
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,120
拿去
Look, here...

715
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:22,780
拿張紙寫下來
Here, just write it down.

716
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,170
你寫什么我就說什么...
Really, just write it down and I will say it to you...

717
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,890
只要你答應
as long as you promise

718
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:31,060
再也別讓我見到你了
I will never have to see you again.

719
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,190
你們倆都是
Either of you.

720
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:18,720
我會從德黑蘭回來的
I will come back from Tehran.

721
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,560
我知道
I know you will.

722
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:27,020
不只是為了她
And not just for her.

723
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,920
你們他媽的去哪了
Where the fuck were you?

724
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,010
他想找人談心
He wanted to talk.

725
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,040
還有四十五分鐘他就要出發了
He's got 45 minutes to load out.

726
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,850
他準備就緒了
He's all set.

727
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:19,420
你把他帶出基地了
You took him off base.

728
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,930
他威脅說要撂挑子  索爾
He threatened to pull out, Saul.

729
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:22,020
出去可能會發生各種意外
Anything could've happened out there.

730
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,350
可是沒發生
But it didn't.

731
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,110
我真他媽對你無語了
I am truly at a fuckin' loss with you.

732
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,690
能有點信心嗎  索爾
Have a little faith, Saul.

733
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:32,950
兩周前  你根本沒法實施行動
Two weeks ago, there was no operation.

734
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:34,920
因為我  現在才得以行動
Now there is, because of me.

735
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:37,700
我真心希望你能明白這點
I really need you to get that.

736
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,910
為了讓本次行動成功
Because in order for us to pull this thing off,

737
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:41,920
我們必須得想個辦法
we're gonna have to find a way

738
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,410
重新建立彼此間的信任
to trust each other again.

739
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,480
或者想個好辦法假裝互相信任
Or at least come up with a really great plan for faking it.

740
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,090
布洛迪
Brody...

741
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,380
到那邊再見
See you on the other side.
