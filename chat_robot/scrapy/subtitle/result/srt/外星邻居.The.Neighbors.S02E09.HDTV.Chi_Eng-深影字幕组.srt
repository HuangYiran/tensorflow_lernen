00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,980
好了 我要做的就是
All right, so all I need to do is

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,780
填鸡进鸭 再填鸭子进火鸡 然后火鸡鸭
shove the chicken in the duck, the duck in the turkey, and voila...

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,080
闪亮登场
Thanksgiving turducken.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,880
这动物填充也太多了吧
That's an alarming amount of animals to stick inside each other.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,660
你能把他们都填进猪里吗?
Can you put it all in a pig?

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,780
亲爱的 我回家了!
Honey, I'm home!

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,200
你怎么样啊?
How you doin'?

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,420
我猜这出是有故事?
So, I'm guessing there is a story here?

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,260
当然啦 诡异邻居
There certainly is, wacky neighbor.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,140
我们彻夜未眠 看尼克的晚间生活
We've been up all night, watching a Nick at Nite marathon

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,280
感恩节特辑
of Thanksgiving sitcom episodes.

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,700
这让我们想在镇里招批现场观众
It made us want a live studio audience for our very own.

13
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,860
观众 哈?
Audience, huh?

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,220
我心中夙愿就是能有首歌
I always wished, I had a song that followed me around,

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,040
每次我走进房间 它便会奏起
and played everytime I walked into a room.

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,480
- 我的歌是... - 蠢主意
- My song would be... - Stupid idea.

17
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,940
夫人 请继续
Wife, continue.

18
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,220
尼克的晚间生活 教会我们
So, Nick at Nite marathon taught us

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,480
感恩节是特别的一天
that Thanksgiving is a special day

20
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,040
各种亲戚内讧 厨艺失误
filled with troublemaking in-laws, cooking mishaps,

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,640
还有不好的惊喜
and unpleasant surprises.

22
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,100
这也就变成人人嫌弃不想要
Which makes it a holiday which nobody really wanted,

23
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:56,786
可到头来 人人都需要的节日
but in the end, everyone really needed.

24
00:00:56,854 --> 00:01:00,022
汤姆・派第的美国女孩 将成为我的歌
"American girl" by Tom Petty. That would be my song.

25
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,824
我也不想让你们失望
Well, I hate to disappoint you guys,

26
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:02,920
但我还是要大胆说一句
but I'm gonna go out on a limb here,

27
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,229
这次感恩节可不会有不好的惊喜
and say there will be no unpleasant surprises this Thanksgiving.

28
00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:08,965
我同意 有的只是家庭的温馨与平和
I agree. There's been a lovely peace in the family.

29
00:01:09,032 --> 00:01:10,933
再说了 我做的饭很简单
Plus, I'm making a foolproof meal.

30
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:12,268
真的不会出岔子
It literally can't lose.

31
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:15,071
天啊 我们知道接下来是什么了
Oh, boy! We know what comes next.

32
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:16,873
什么意思 什么叫...
Whoa, what do you mean? What co...

33
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,875
节日惊喜到
Cue the holiday surprise.

34
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:21,744
会是谁啊
Who could that be?

35
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:24,213
去看看 会发生什么事吧
Let's watch and see what happens.

36
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:29,185
感恩节快乐
Happy Thanksgiving!

37
00:01:29,253 --> 00:01:32,154
是的 我早到了六小时 过会再谈这个
Yes, I'm six hours early. Now we've talked about that.

38
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:34,957
- 是啊 老爸 早了一会 - 啊
- Yeah, dad, a little early. - Ahh.

39
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:36,392
- 嘿 多米尼克 - 马蒂
- Hey, Dominick. - Mwah!

40
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,426
特丽莎在哪
Where's Theresa?

41
00:01:37,494 --> 00:01:38,694
不知道
No idea.

42
00:01:38,762 --> 00:01:41,397
经历五十年地狱生活后 我跟她结束了
After almost five miserable decades, I ended it.

43
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:44,267
我们要离婚了 爷爷要搬来啦
We're getting a divorce. Grandpa's moving in.

44
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:45,801
不妙哦
Uh-oh!

45
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,905
我喜欢节日特辑
I love holiday episodes.

46
00:01:52,442 --> 00:01:56,212
# 我们来自外太空 定居在新泽西 #
We came from outer space and settled in New Jersey 

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,164
# 我们取名叫拉里・伯德 #
We took names like Larry Bird 

48
00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:00,049
# 和杰西・乔伊娜・柯西 #
and Jackie Joyner-Kersee

49
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:02,218

# 然后人类搬到隔壁 #
Then the humans moved next door 

50
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:04,387
# 挑战我们的极限 #
Started testing all our limits 

51
00:02:04,454 --> 00:02:06,555

# 请坐下来 收看节目 #
So sit right down, enjoy the show 

52
00:02:06,623 --> 00:02:09,025

# 半个小时就结束 #
We'll be done in 30 minutes 

53
00:02:06,623 --> 00:02:09,025

外星邻居 第二季第九集

54
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:14,764
你什么意思 老爸 你离开老妈了?
Okay, so, what did you say, dad? You left mom?

55
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:16,666
心意已决
Like a baby at a fire station.

56
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:19,568
多米尼克 我们很高兴你来 很高兴
Dominick, we're happy to have you, so happy.

57
00:02:19,636 --> 00:02:21,203
我们很喜欢 可是拜托
We love it. But come on.

58
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:22,827
为什么要和特丽莎离婚? 
Why divorce Theresa? 

59
00:02:22,828 --> 00:02:23,606
我们恨彼此
We hate each other.

60
00:02:23,674 --> 00:02:26,375
你们都恨了五十年了 你们喜欢恨彼此啊
You've hated each other for 50 years. You love to hate each other.

61
00:02:26,443 --> 00:02:28,644
仇恨就是你们婚姻的粘合剂
Hate is the glue that keeps your marriage together.

62
00:02:28,712 --> 00:02:30,479
- 爷爷 爷爷 - 感恩节快乐
- Grandpa, Grandpa! - Happy Thanksgiving!

63
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:32,148
嘿 孩子们
Hey, guys!

64
00:02:32,215 --> 00:02:33,616
奶奶在哪
Where's Grandma?

65
00:02:33,683 --> 00:02:35,818
我离开她了 孩子们 都结束了 她太坏了
I left her, kids. It's over. She's horrible.

66
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:37,353
她两点到
She'll be here at 2:00.

67
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:38,954
所以她还会来的
Oh, so she's still coming.

68
00:02:39,022 --> 00:02:41,257
即使你们已经分开? 有意思
Even though you're splitting up? Fun.

69
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:42,825
当然她要来
Of course she's coming.

70
00:02:42,893 --> 00:02:45,628
我们可不能让那个老骨头独自一人过感恩节
We can't let that crotchety old bag sit alone on Thanksgiving.

71
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:46,862
我们是一家人
We're family.

72
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,098
现在 孩子们 我要你们带我上楼
Now, kids, I want you to take me upstairs,

73
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,333
给我看看爷爷要睡谁的卧室
and show grandpa whose bedroom he's taking.

74
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:52,835
- 什么 - 你说什么
- Say what now? - What did you say?

75
00:02:52,903 --> 00:02:54,670
- 走吧 - 你恨我的卧室
- Let's go. - You'd hate my bedroom!

76
00:02:54,738 --> 00:02:56,639
- 我还尿床 - 不 你才不呢
- I still pee the bed! - No, you don't!

77
00:02:56,706 --> 00:02:58,707
我现在就去尿
I'm going to as soon as I get up there.

78
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:00,976
- 你老爸可不能搬进来 - 当然不能
- So, your father's not moving in here. - Of course not.

79
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:02,745
因为让那个男人来我们家
Because fitting that man in our house

80
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:05,047
就像填鸭子进火鸡
is kind of like fitting this duck into this turkey.

81
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:06,649
别担心 宝贝 他不会久留
Don't worry. Babe, he's not staying.

82
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:07,983
我妈是个病态的人
My mother is a damaged person

83
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:09,385
她需要有发泄对象
who needs someone to scream at.

84
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:11,454
我老爸身边需要有病态的人
My father needs a damaged person around,

85
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:12,855
这样他才有优越感
so he can feel superior.

86
00:03:12,923 --> 00:03:15,658
相信我 分手不会持久的
Believe me, there's no way this breakup will last.

87
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:16,625
那倒是
True.

88
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:19,328
如果说我们从节日特辑里学到什么的话
If there's one thing we learned from our holiday-episode research,

89
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:21,263
那就是在节日最后 一切
it's that things will always go back to normal

90
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:22,598
都会回归正常
at the end of the holiday.

91
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,867
没错 他们想让你认为一切不可收拾
Yes. They try to trick you into thinking that they won't,

92
00:03:24,935 --> 00:03:27,069
其实他们也不想改变节目根基
but they don't want to change the premise of the show.

93
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:29,538
要是你爸搬进来 根基就变了
Well, this premise will change if your father moves in,

94
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:31,907
因为我会跳进烤箱
'cause then I'm getting in the oven with the poultry.

95
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,911
迪克 我们的观众在车库
Dick, our audience is in the garage.

96
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:38,047
我和爸爸聊天的时候 你去逗逗他们吧
Would you please entertain them while I have a chat with dad?

97
00:03:38,115 --> 00:03:41,650
没人尊重我的打毛衣时间
Does no one respect my knitting time?

98
00:03:41,718 --> 00:03:45,521
夫君 我不喜欢马蒂他们家
Oh, husband, I do not enjoy how the story has become

99
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:47,223
故事发展走向
about the Mertzes over there.

100
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,725
我们是主要家庭 他们是怪异邻居
We are the main family. They are the wacky neighbors.

101
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:51,727
我们应该有自己的感恩节故事
We deserve a thanksgiving story of our own,

102
00:03:51,795 --> 00:03:54,253
而不是一堆让他们感恩节更有意思的笑话
Not just a bunch of jokes that makes their story funnier.

103
00:03:54,273 --> 00:03:55,338
你有什么主意?
So, what are you thinking?

104
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,085
我们去高速生产线找个工作
Perhaps we get a job in a high-speed assembly line.

105
00:03:57,095 --> 00:03:58,112
好主意
Ooh! Good one.

106
00:03:58,127 --> 00:04:01,356
带回流浪汉 帮他清洁
Or bring home a homeless man, clean him up,

107
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:03,072
让他当大公司老总
and make him the C.E.O. of a major corporation.

108
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:04,173
太棒了
Great.

109
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:06,669
或者我们和孩子们交换
Or we could trade responsibilities with the children

110
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:09,545
学些好玩却有意义的事
in order to learn comical, and yet mutually beneficial lessons.

111
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:11,614
你认为当大人很难吗
You think being a grown-up is hard?

112
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:12,681
试试当小孩吧
Try being a kid sometime.

113
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,118
我太太说结婚纪念日
My wife said that for our anniversary,

114
00:04:16,186 --> 00:04:18,687
她要去她从未去过的地方
she wanted to go somewhere she's never been before,

115
00:04:18,755 --> 00:04:21,490
我说 那不如去厨房吧
so I said, "Try the kitchen."

116
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:27,328
怎么样啊 亲爱的
How we doing on time, sweetie?

117
00:04:27,396 --> 00:04:28,930
烤炉里六小时
Six hours in the oven.

118
00:04:28,998 --> 00:04:31,833
还有三分之二的肉是生的
I still got two out of the three animals uncooked.

119
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:34,469
好像大的在保护小的一样
It's like the bigger one is protecting the littler ones.

120
00:04:34,537 --> 00:04:36,204
让它们煮熟啊!
Let them burn!

121
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:38,206
尽量快点吧 以我的经验
Well, try and speed it up, 'cause in my experience,

122
00:04:38,274 --> 00:04:40,441
我爸妈吃东西的时候 不太吵架
my parents fight less when they have food in their mouths.

123
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:42,143
你老妈可要抱怨了
Your mother's gonna be a basket case.

124
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:44,412
煮熟啊 科学怪人
Cook, you unholy Frankenstein!

125
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,880
- 煮熟 - 拜托
- Cook! - Come on!

126
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:48,383
我们会好好的
We're gonna be okay.

127
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,684
但你和奶奶
But you and Grandma?

128
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:51,286
我们都爱你俩
I loved you two together.

129
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:53,209
那怎么会发生 你们是灵魂伴侣啊
How is this even possible? You two are soul mates.

130
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:55,857
我不知道 我一直觉得你们俩恨彼此
I don't know. I always thought you two sort of hated each other.

131
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:57,592
这才是我的孙女嘛
Now, that's my granddaughter.

132
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,427
孩子 别伤心了
And, kid, don't be sad.

133
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:01,496
你知道上周我在汉普顿客栈
You know what I've been doing this last week

134
00:05:01,563 --> 00:05:03,031
房间里干了什么吗
in my room at the Hampton Inn?

135
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:05,466
床上吃喝 微笑
Eating in bed and smiling.

136
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:07,435
自从我结婚 这两样都没干过
I haven't done either since I got married.

137
00:05:07,503 --> 00:05:10,046
可你们走过人生三分之二了啊 
But you were together for two-thirds of a human life span.

138
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:11,318
为什么现在分开
Why now?

139
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:13,512
我受够了
Eh, it was enough.

140
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,543
我有个新丧夫的数学老师
I got a recently widowed math teacher.

141
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:17,679
虽说她有个爆炸头
She's got a weird Jewfro thing going on,

142
00:05:17,746 --> 00:05:18,947
可人不丑
But she's not hideous.

143
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:21,583
- 你要我撮合吗 - 当然 我来者不拒
- You want me to set it up? - Sure. I'm open.

144
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,518
把我在汉普顿的电话给她
Give her my number at the Hamp.

145
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:26,487
天啊 奶奶来了
Oh, boy. There's Grandma.

146
00:05:26,555 --> 00:05:29,257
现在 她要展开泪水攻势换取同情心了
Now, she's gonna be pulling all the waterworks with sympathy.

147
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:30,625
孩子们 可不要上当
But, kids, don't fall for it.

148
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:33,127
好了 老爸 对她好点
All right, dad. Just please be nice to her.

149
00:05:33,195 --> 00:05:35,363
上帝啊 求她对我好点
God, please let her be nice to me.

150
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:38,966
- 甜心 - 嘿
- Sweetheart! - Hey!

151
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:40,434
感恩节快乐
Happy Thanksgiving!

152
00:05:40,502 --> 00:05:42,770
- 你好 亲爱的 - 你好 感恩节快乐
- Aw! Hello, honey. - Happy Thanksgiving. Hello.

153
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:45,239
- 你闻起来不错哦 - 噢
- Mm! Don't you smell good? - Oh.

154
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:47,808
家里看起来很棒嘛
And the house looks gorgeous.

155
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:50,144
真的吗 谢谢你
Really? Thank you.

156
00:05:50,212 --> 00:05:52,613
你头发又长又好 皮肤还有点小麦色
Wow. Your hair's all nice and long, and you look tan.

157
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:54,114
这周去晒的
Hit the spa this week.

158
00:05:54,182 --> 00:05:56,050
我弄了铜色 接了发
I am bronzed and hair-extended,

159
00:05:56,117 --> 00:05:58,752
还脱了毛 我都不知道那种地方还脱毛
and waxed in places I had no idea people wax.

160
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,522
现在我们知道了
Well, now we have that information.

161
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,591
好嘞 我想喝点酒了
Okay. I'm ready for some wine.

162
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:07,094
昨晚桑巴舞泡沫派对有点太疯狂啦
The foam party at La Bamba got a little crazy last night,

163
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:08,929
说不定我还吃了狗毛
And I could use some hair of the dog.

164
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:11,265
- 多米尼克 - 特丽莎
- Dominick. - Theresa.

165
00:06:13,502 --> 00:06:17,438
猜猜谁不小心舞会上约了两个人
Guess who's accidentally got two dates to the prom?

166
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:19,206
我永不忘记
I'll never get away with it.

167
00:06:21,343 --> 00:06:23,277
我们错过了什么
What did we miss?

168
00:06:23,345 --> 00:06:24,678
我不知道
I don't know.

169
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:33,938
晚餐闻起来很香
Oh, dinner smells mouth-watering.

170
00:06:34,706 --> 00:06:36,573
我不知道以前说过这句话没
Now, I don't know if I've ever told you this,

171
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:38,642
你做饭不错
but I think you're a wonderful cook.

172
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,210
你没说过
You haven't.

173
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:42,980
你从没说过 从没有
You haven't ever said that, like never.

174
00:06:44,682 --> 00:06:46,783
老妈 我要说
You know, ma, I got to say,

175
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:49,086
你好多年都没有这么有精神了
you haven't looked this good in years.

176
00:06:49,153 --> 00:06:50,354
我很欣慰
Well, I should hope so.

177
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,788
我减了肥
I've lost a lot of weight.

178
00:06:51,856 --> 00:06:54,358
准确的说是 二百一十磅
210 pounds of soul-sucking fat, to be exact.

179
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:56,159
太好笑了
Hardy har.

180
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:57,894
我在商场和其他单身老人
Oh, plus, I've been power-walking at the mall

181
00:06:57,962 --> 00:06:58,996
一起暴走
with other senior singles.

182
00:06:59,063 --> 00:07:00,464
我有说脱毛吗?
And did I mention the wax?

183
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:02,566
是说过了 绝对说过了
Yes, you did. You definitely did.

184
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:04,134
马斯克 带你妹妹上楼去
Max, take your sister upstairs.

185
00:07:04,202 --> 00:07:05,769
你看起来真美 奶奶
You look pretty, Grandma.

186
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:07,571
谢谢你 小甜心
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

187
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:10,140
记住 婚姻会毁了你容颜
Now, remember, marriage ruins your looks.

188
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,175
不 别记住 快走吧
Nope. Don't remember that. Go.

189
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:14,811
老妈 你一人住在大房子里干吗呢
So, ma, what are you gonna do in that big house all alone?

190
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,179
可能会卖掉
Probably sell it.

191
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:18,315
那 我的房间怎么办
Well, then, what's... what's gonna happen to my room?

192
00:07:18,383 --> 00:07:19,783
哪个是你的房间
Which one was your room?

193
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:21,785
我的工艺室还是瑜伽室?
My craft room or the yoga room?

194
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:23,654
从你卧室往进走到走廊尽头
It's the one down the hall from your bedroom

195
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:25,989
这样我晚上害怕的时候 你就能听到了
so you could hear me in case I got scared during the night.

196
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:27,491
瑜伽室啊
Ah. Yoga room.

197
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:29,826
看看我们坐在这沉默
Look at us just sitting here in silence.

198
00:07:29,894 --> 00:07:31,895
我们是什么 多余的? 做点事
What are we, extras? Do something.

199
00:07:32,963 --> 00:07:33,996
我是同性恋
I'm gay.

200
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:35,798
我就知道
I knew it.

201
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:38,467
好了 伙计们 我能和家人单独呆会吗
All right, guys, can I have a moment alone with my family, please?

202
00:07:38,535 --> 00:07:41,237
再次声明 我发现你们社会
For the record, I find it very regrettable

203
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:42,972
一大遗憾就是
that your primitive society

204
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,341
亲戚家庭里地位不高
Doesn't place a higher value on in-laws.

205
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:47,643
合法第三方也一样
Or legitimate third-party candidates.

206
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,045
再会
See you guys.

207
00:07:50,514 --> 00:07:51,614
天啊
Oh, boy.

208
00:07:51,682 --> 00:07:54,884
我的相亲资料又有点击者了
Another hit on my online dating profile.

209
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:57,453
哇 他挺帅的嘛 才六十岁
Oh, now, he's a cutie, and he's still in his 60s.

210
00:07:57,521 --> 00:07:59,689
亲娘啊 别跟我说你注册了
For God's sake, don't tell me you've signed up

211
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:01,624
相亲网站
with one of those online dating scams.

212
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:04,126
是啊 这种交易就是我付二十美元
Yep. It's the kind of scam where I give them 20 bucks

213
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:06,095
他们还我激情澎湃的性生活 
and they give me a revitalized sex life.

214
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:08,331
- 噢 - 拜托 两位
- Oh! - Oh, come on, guys.

215
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:10,700
只是虚张声势罢了 你根本没在约会啊
This is just posturing. You're not dating already.

216
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:14,036
是啊 你们俩没分手嘛
Right, because you guys aren't breaking up. Right?

217
00:08:17,174 --> 00:08:19,142
幸好我那个年代
It's a good thing they didn't have online dating

218
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:20,943
没有相亲网站 不然还得
when I was younger or I would have needed

219
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:22,478
给刚刚脱毛的地方复原
A what-I-just-had-waxed transplant.

220
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:33,589
是啊 把纸巾扔掉
Oh, sure. Throw the tissue away.

221
00:08:33,656 --> 00:08:35,357
反正还有很多嘛
There's plenty of snot-free real estate.

222
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:36,859
不 你就是乐意扔掉
No, you just want to throw it away,

223
00:08:36,926 --> 00:08:38,327
换新的 崭新的
and move on to a fresh, new one.

224
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:39,361
实话 我乐意
That's true. I do.

225
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,130
雷吉 我实话实话了
Reggie, I'm gonna go out on a limb,

226
00:08:41,197 --> 00:08:43,265
这只是我爷爷奶奶的事
and say that this is about my grandparents.

227
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,633
你说得对
You're right.

228
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:46,769
我生气是因为我跟察布隆的灵魂伴侣分手
I'm mad because I blew off my Zabvronian soul mate,

229
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:49,204
她可保证爱我永远 你却没有
who's guaranteed to love me forever, for you.

230
00:08:49,272 --> 00:08:52,541
你很乐意两个人分手
You seem so happy about two people breaking up,

231
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:54,009
即使他们过了五十年
even after 50 years.

232
00:08:58,748 --> 00:08:59,982
我知道他们压力很大
I know it's stressful,

233
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:01,483
但是你要和人类在一起
but if you're gonna be with a human,

234
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:03,552
你就要接受我们的不可预计性
You have to accept the fact that we're unpredictable.

235
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,789
半数以上的婚姻终结 这是事实
More than 50% of marriages end. That's just reality.

236
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:08,457
一半
50%.

237
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:10,659
人类是始乱终弃的禽兽
Humans are inconstant monsters.

238
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:15,030
我跟禽兽在约会
I'm dating a monster.

239
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:21,003
当然 琥珀 就跟隔壁外星人约会吧
Sure, Amber. Just date the weird alien kid next door.

240
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:22,738
会很有意思的
It'll be fun.

241
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:26,909
天啊
Oh, God.

242
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:30,478
我的烤箱搞不定这些尸体
My oven can't handle this many corpses.

243
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:31,580
来真的了 黛比
This is real, deb.

244
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,014
我爸妈真要分开了
My parents are splitting up for real.

245
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:34,382
他们要不和好
If they don't get back together,

246
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,051
我就是个家庭破碎的孩子
that makes me the child of a broken home.

247
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,519
我不想当孤儿
I don't want to be an orphan.

248
00:09:37,587 --> 00:09:40,488
亲爱的 我懂 尽管你把孤儿定义弄错了
Oh, honey, I know, although that's not what an orphan is.

249
00:09:40,556 --> 00:09:43,316
我觉得你应该对此
You know, I think you could be getting

250
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:44,326
更伤心一些 黛比
a little more upset here, Deb.

251
00:09:44,393 --> 00:09:46,061
你知道离婚家庭的孩子
Did you know that children of divorce

252
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,829
自己也趋向于离婚吗
are more likely to divorce themselves?

253
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:50,499
这也许跟你的未来息息相关
This could have serious implications on your future.

254
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:54,969
不管发生什么 那个男人别想搬进来
Okay, well, whatever happens, that man is not moving in here.

255
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:56,170
马蒂 你的计划是什么
Marty, what's your plan?

256
00:09:56,238 --> 00:09:59,173
好嘞 真是个好主意
Oh, right. That's a good idea.

257
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:01,275
让孩子对爸妈的幸福
Make it the responsibility of the child

258
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,944
负担起责任
to keep his parents together.

259
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:04,717
你知道这有多可怕吗
Do you know how detrimental that could be?

260
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,470
对一个四十三岁的大人来说?
To a 43-year-old man?

261
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,316
亲爱的 此时此刻
Well, honey, at a moment like this,

262
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:11,386
任何人都会像孩子般受伤无助的
every man becomes a hurt, helpless little boy.

263
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:13,087
少废话!
Stop your blubbering!

264
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,690
我们路过想让你们别太担心
We just wanted to pop by to remind you not to worry.

265
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:17,992
感恩节晚餐一过
This is a completely manufactured crisis

266
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:20,561
这些复杂的问题便会自己解决的
which will resolve itself by the end of Thanksgiving dinner.

267
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:22,163
要是你想快点结束
Although, if you'd like it resolved sooner,

268
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,165
我们很乐意帮忙啊
We're happy to pull some hijinks.

269
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:25,933
因为这才是主演的戏份嘛
Because that's what main characters do!

270
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,134
考虑下吧
Think about it.

271
00:10:27,202 --> 00:10:28,335
天啊 
Oh, God.

272
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:44,785
看看你们
Just look at you guys.

273
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,354
还有曾经的火花 对吗
You still got that same old spark, you know?

274
00:10:47,422 --> 00:10:50,624
我想知道你怎么还有
Well, I would like to know where you even

275
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,426
钱买那个手机
came up with the cash for that phone.

276
00:10:52,494 --> 00:10:54,628
你的合约还有一年呢
You had at least another year on your contract!

277
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,430
我只不过用了结婚纪念日
I just used the money I was gonna waste

278
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:57,832
要送礼物的钱
on your anniversary present.

279
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,800
好主意啊
Great idea, sister.

280
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,902
我要花钱买瓶
I think I'll spend my wad on a bottle

281
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,604
那些蓝色药丸
of those little, blue pills.

282
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:07,341
要知道 我们这年纪女性可是十倍多于男性
You know, the gals outnumber the fellas 10 to 1 at our age.

283
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:09,610
等不及想看看
Can't wait to meet the lucky broad

284
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:12,413
哪位好运气把自己余生都摊到
who gets stuck having to listen to you snore

285
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:13,714
听你打鼾了
for the rest of her life.

286
00:11:13,782 --> 00:11:15,049
孩子们 吃饭啦
Kids, dinner!

287
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:17,985
来吃饭吧 今天要结束了 大家都各回各家
Come eat now so this day can end and everyone can go home

288
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,654
不许呆在我家
to their house that isn't this one.

289
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,223
有人见我夫人了吗
Has anyone seen my wife?

290
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,126
她要错过鸡鸭火鸡连环塞的美味了
She's going to miss this revolting bird-on-bird-on-bird action.

291
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:28,128
黛比用了你的填料方哦 老妈
Debbie used your stuffing recipe, Mom.

292
00:11:28,196 --> 00:11:29,529
老爸 你的最爱啊
Dad, that's your favorite, right?

293
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:30,831
跟老妈讲讲你最爱了
Tell Mom how that's your favorite.

294
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,766
我从不喜欢她的填料
I never liked her stuffing.

295
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:35,402
那是因为做的太美了 你个白痴
That's because it's too good for you, you nincompoop.

296
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,670
注意措辞
Watch your language.

297
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,039
这可不是你去的乱酒吧
This isn't one of your sailor hump-hump bars.

298
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:41,408
伺候他吧 黛比
Oh! Enjoy him, Debbie.

299
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:44,044
不不 你伺候他
No, no. You enjoy him.

300
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:46,413
你把他带回家 你伺候他吧
You take him home, and you enjoy him.

301
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:48,148
我再也不能忍了 黛比
I really can't tolerate this anymore, Deborah.

302
00:11:48,216 --> 00:11:50,250
这可是你灵魂伴侣的父母
These are the parents of your soul mate.

303
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:53,754
这神圣的关系是要敬畏的
That is a sacred bond that deserves mad respect.

304
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:55,289
宣言
Announcement!

305
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:57,190
我发现故事主线了
I found us a story line.

306
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,959
你好
Hello!

307
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:00,127
你好啊
Hi, there.

308
00:12:00,194 --> 00:12:02,796
我们是杰西・乔伊娜・柯西的父母
We are the parents of Jackie Joyner-Kersee,

309
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:06,199
是那位的岳父和岳母
and we are the in-laws to that guy.

310
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,916
广告时间 广告...
Cut to commercial. Cut to commer...

311
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,376
不敢相信他们让我来儿童桌就餐
I can't believe they stuck me at the kids' table.

312
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:27,279
迪克 你喜欢老人吗
So, Dick, you like old people, huh?

313
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,547
我发现他们很有性格
I find they have character,

314
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,415
有历史 超级会打毛线
history, and superior knitting skills.

315
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,250
更别提超酷的味道了
Not to mention that cool smell.

316
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,685
那你愿意和你自己
How would you like a chance

317
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,822
专属的老人分享一间卧室吗
to have your very own old person living right in your room?

318
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,457
这也太棒了吧
Doesn't that sound amazing?

319
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:42,327
我的专属老人 美梦啊
My very own old person? What a dream.

320
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:45,897
孩子们 我的智商比你们高五十倍
Guys, my I.Q. is more than 50 times greater than yours.

321
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,066
你们以为这样就能把我骗到吗
Did you really think you could manipulate me like that?

322
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,768
不妨一试嘛
Uh, it was worth a try.

323
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,003
拉我的手指
Pull my finger.

324
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,505
抱歉 臣妾做不到啊
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

325
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:59,311
杰西的爸妈也来了真好啊
It is so nice to have Jackie's parents here.

326
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,179
有个缓冲也不错
Kind of nice to have a buffer.

327
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,115
谢谢你们 马蒂 黛比・韦弗
Well, thank you, Marty and Debbie Weaver,

328
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,683
用你自己辛苦工作的血汗钱在你家
For hosting us in your home that you paid for

329
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,752
招待我们
from the sweat of your brow.

330
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,420
好嘞 又来了
Okay. Here we go.

331
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,322
你想说什么 岳父
So what are you saying, father-in-law,

332
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,592
没有我爸资助 我不能负担自己的生活方式吗
that I can't afford my lifestyle without my father's trust fund?

333
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,461
他可不是这个意思 夫君
He's not saying that at all, husband.

334
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,962
我可爱的女儿说得对
My lovely daughter is right.

335
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,098
我可没那样说过 没说一次
I have not said that, not once.

336
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:22,566
其他人却这样议论
Other people have said it.

337
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:24,868
他们议论纷纷 不是我们
They've said it a lot. But not us.

338
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:27,104
还有我没说过的就是你们家
Another thing we don't say is that your family fortune

339
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,006
收入都是别人辛苦挣来的
is mostly blood money taken from the people...

340
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,874
我们一生致力于帮助的人
People we have devoted our lives to helping.

341
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:32,042
你们两位从哪来的?
Where are you guys from again?

342
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,143
- 法国 - 加拿大
- France. - Canada.

343
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:35,112
你最好小心我老公
Oh, you better watch out for my husband.

344
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,313
他讨厌外国人
He hates foreigners.

345
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:38,248
自己去牙买加旅游 
This from the woman who kept her wallet

346
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:40,784
把钱藏在内衣下的女人 还有脸说我
in her underwear during our entire Jamaican cruise.

347
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:42,953
我希望你满意了 岳父母们
I hope you're satisfied, in-laws.

348
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:45,189
你们让这顿感恩节晚宴
You've turned this Thanksgiving meal

349
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:46,624
混乱不堪 冲突不断
into chaos and conflict.

350
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:48,225
一如既往 毒药功效
As always, you're toxic.

351
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:50,127
放轻松 拉里
Easy, Larry.

352
00:13:50,194 --> 00:13:51,695
尊重都去哪了
Yeah, what happened to respecting,

353
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:53,663
视岳父母为亲生父母的承诺呢 拉里
and loving your in-laws as your own, Larry?

354
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:55,799
我承诺时 杰西的父母
When I said that, Jackie's parents

355
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:57,968
还有他们比汝等神圣的态度
and their holier-than-thou attitude

356
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:01,304
都在宇宙另一边好好藏着呢
were safely ensconced on the other side of the Universe.

357
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:03,874
夫君 假装的私人耳语不奏效
Husband, fake private whispering does not work.

358
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:05,794
拉里也没用
Neither does Larry.

359
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,412
- 毒药 - 她是毒药?
- Toxic! - She's toxic?

360
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,749
这位现在就像穿小鞋跑长跑
This one over here is like Three Mile Island in sensible shoes.

361
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:14,618
吃你的饭 禽兽
Keep stuffing your face, animal.

362
00:14:14,685 --> 00:14:16,853
现在墓地买一送一
You've got side-by-side grave plots now.

363
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:19,922
看啊 看你你来我往 唇枪舌战
Come on! Look at that repartee, huh?

364
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,024
为什么你想离开这个家庭呢
Why would you want to walk away from that, from this family?

365
00:14:22,092 --> 00:14:23,092
为什么
Why?

366
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,327
别离开你家
Or your lovely house.

367
00:14:24,394 --> 00:14:26,429
既然你都把房贷还了
Now that you finally paid off that mortgage,

368
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:28,664
你的草坪动物也深得你心
and your lawn animals are just the way you like them.

369
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:31,167
我们家没有草坪动物
Our house doesn't even have lawn animals.

370
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:32,568
各位 我只想说我以你们为自豪
Guys, I just want to say I'm proud of you.

371
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:34,870
许多人就认命这么不开心了
Most people would just settle for being unhappy,

372
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:37,573
要解除五十年的婚约需要勇气
but it takes some serious sack to break up after 50 years

373
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:41,077
看看你们能不能活得更好 太棒了
to see if there's a better life out there, so mazel tov.

374
00:14:41,144 --> 00:14:43,179
琥珀 你怎么能这么说
Amber, how could you say that?

375
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:45,848
我希望我能和一个人幸福快乐到永远
Well, I hope that I'm happy with one person forever,

376
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,050
但若事与愿违 我想和爷爷奶奶一样勇敢
but if not, I'd like to be as brave as my grandparents.

377
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:51,853
容我先走一步
May I please be excused?

378
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:56,591
我也能先走吗
May I also be excused?

379
00:14:59,628 --> 00:15:01,596
- 哦 - 我跟他聊聊
- Oh. - I'll talk to him.

380
00:15:01,664 --> 00:15:03,665
好的 去跟我儿子交心谈谈
Oh, yes. Go have a heart to heart with our son.

381
00:15:03,732 --> 00:15:05,066
这是你强项
That's your strong suit.

382
00:15:05,134 --> 00:15:06,401
你太会说笑了
You're such a delight.

383
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,338
你们知道我是相信直觉的人吗
Do you know I'm very intuitive?

384
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:12,173
我做了很多能量工作
I've done lots of energy work,

385
00:15:12,241 --> 00:15:14,709
我能感受到家里的麻烦事
and I sense some trouble in the home.

386
00:15:14,777 --> 00:15:17,679
出人意料 天才啊
Wow. You think, genius?

387
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:21,348
老妈 你听到我找到工作了吗
So, Mommy, did you hear that I got a job?

388
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,017
不 我什么都没听到
No. I can't hear anything

389
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:25,619
拉里一直强词夺理
over Larry's deafening sense of entitlement.

390
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:27,254
不好意思
Oh, I'm sorry.

391
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:31,058
你胡扯八道的时候 我也没听清
I couldn't hear you over your deafening sense of sucking.

392
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:35,596
杰西 抱歉先走了
Jackie, um, if you'll excuse me,

393
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:37,832
让你和你家人先处理问题吧
I'm gonna let you deal with your family drama.

394
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:39,100
我去看看我的家人
I'm gonna go check on mine.

395
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:43,371
你们不喝酒 那...
You guys don't drink wine, so...

396
00:15:47,108 --> 00:15:49,309
雷吉 你让不让我进
Reggie, are you gonna let me in?

397
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:51,778
别烦我 禽兽啊
Leave me alone, you monster!

398
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:53,847
儿子 你还好吗
Son, are you okay?

399
00:15:53,915 --> 00:15:54,915
开门 马蒂
Open up, Marty.

400
00:15:54,982 --> 00:15:57,083
走开 你不在乎我
Go away! You don't care about me!

401
00:15:57,151 --> 00:15:59,119
你伤了我的心 你根本不在乎
You hurt my feelings, and you don't care!

402
00:16:00,555 --> 00:16:03,823
我还是先安抚孩子吧
I'm gonna start with the actual child.

403
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:08,395
雷吉 半数以上的人离婚是很糟
Reggie, it stinks that half of all people get divorced,

404
00:16:08,462 --> 00:16:11,231
可你不能确定爱会持久啊
and that you can't be sure that love will last forever,

405
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:14,834
可这让持久的爱才弥足珍贵 不是吗
but that's what makes it so amazing when it does, right?

406
00:16:14,902 --> 00:16:17,671
你们俩 当然你们不相爱了
And you two, of course you fell out of love.

407
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:19,773
因为你们不努力去爱了
'Cause you stopped working at it.

408
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,310
这可是日积月累的细功夫
It takes work every single day.

409
00:16:23,877 --> 00:16:27,547
没有绝对 雷吉 要靠你辛苦经营
There are no guarantees, Reggie, so you have to work at it.

410
00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:31,150
即使过了五十年 一辈子
Even after 50 years, or it dies.

411
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,155
一辈子的经营才让一切多么美好
And it's that work that makes it beautiful.

412
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:42,161
太美了 黛比・韦弗
That was lovely, Debbie Weaver.

413
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:43,963
谢谢 雷吉
Well, thanks, Reg.

414
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,433
肺腑之言 借酒而发
It was from the heart... And the wine.

415
00:16:49,737 --> 00:16:52,739
我们还好吗
So, are we okay?

416
00:16:52,806 --> 00:16:55,341
琥珀 你知道历史课的标志
Amber, you know the sign in history class

417
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:57,744
记载道"努力赢取自由"
that says "Work sets you free."?

418
00:16:57,811 --> 00:17:00,146
说的就是我们
It's about us.

419
00:17:00,214 --> 00:17:02,648
其实是说大屠杀 不过我懂你
It's actually a Holocaust diorama, but I hear you.

420
00:17:02,716 --> 00:17:05,218
我喜欢要和你共度每一天
I like that we're gonna have to spend every single day

421
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:07,687
一起经营我们的爱情 至死不渝
of our lives working to keep our love alive.

422
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:08,755
你确定?
Are you sure?

423
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:11,757
简根本不需要经营
Jane wouldn't be any work at all.

424
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:13,959
任何值得的事都需要努力
Anything worthwhile takes work.

425
00:17:14,027 --> 00:17:16,028
那你们俩呢
And what about you two?

426
00:17:16,096 --> 00:17:19,198
你们真的愿意重头再来吗
Do you seriously want to start over now?

427
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:22,668
我们重战桃花场
We go back out there,

428
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:26,071
大家都期待我们人模人样的
people are gonna want us to work on ourselves.

429
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:29,074
我每天都要刮胡子
I'm gonna have to shave every day,

430
00:17:29,142 --> 00:17:31,143
收腹提臀 冲厕所
suck in my gut, flush.

431
00:17:31,211 --> 00:17:32,911
可不是
Tell me about it.

432
00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:35,714
你知道弄成这样要多辛苦嘛
You know how tiring it is to get all fapitzed like this?

433
00:17:35,782 --> 00:17:37,049
你看起来真美 韦弗太太
You look great, Mrs. Weaver.

434
00:17:37,117 --> 00:17:39,651
住嘴 我讨厌有氧运动和脱毛
Stop. I hate cardio. I hate getting waxed.

435
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:42,521
我讨厌这手机的铃声
I hate the stupid noises that phone makes,

436
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:44,790
更讨厌把它带身上
and I hate having to hold in my toots.

437
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:46,058
是啊
Yeah.

438
00:17:46,126 --> 00:17:48,360
我更愿意跟你谈天 过一辈子
I'd rather phone it in and die with you

439
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:52,231
而不是跟一些想让我锻炼的脑残过
than some broad who wants me to work for the rest of my life.

440
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:55,721
# 我守护你 我守护你 #
I got you, I got you  

441
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:57,691

过来 你个混蛋
Come here, you stinker.

442
00:17:57,726 --> 00:17:59,671
特丽莎
Theresa.

443
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:04,176
# 我守护你 我守护你 我守护你 #
I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you 


444
00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:10,382
这么说 你们俩和好了?
So, does this mean that you guys are back together?

445
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,419
为了最恼人的理由
For the most depressing reason imaginable.

446
00:18:13,486 --> 00:18:15,954
好消息 各位
Great news, everybody!

447
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,156
我爸妈和好如初啦
My mom and dad are back together!

448
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:20,792
- 太棒了 - 是吧 我就知道
- Yay! - See? I knew it.

449
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,194
节日最后 一切都会好的
Things always go back to normal at the end of the holiday.

450
00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:26,231
这倒提醒我了 临近晚上九点
Oh! Which reminds me, it's nearly 9:00 P.M.

451
00:18:26,298 --> 00:18:29,567
我宝贵的岳父母 你们还要搭虫洞回去吧
My precious in-laws, I believe you have a wormhole to catch.

452
00:18:29,635 --> 00:18:32,470
家乡许多和平事务要处理
Plenty of peace rallies back home to attend.

453
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:35,540
我猜你很乐意送我们走
I bet you would love to see us leave so soon,

454
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:38,810
可我们有一辈子东西还没打开
but we have a lifetime of possessions to unpack.

455
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:39,978
打开?
Unpack?

456
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:42,414
是的 很显然 你们家需要我们
Yes, it's clear that your family needs us

457
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:45,950
比你父亲战后的孤儿还可怜
more than even the orphans your father's war created.

458
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:47,218
我们要留下
So we're staying.

459
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:49,587
宇宙里再没比扶你们家
There is no bigger charity case in the Universe

460
00:18:49,654 --> 00:18:50,888
更迫切的扶贫项目了

恭喜啊

他们不走了
They're not leaving.

464
00:18:56,962 --> 00:18:58,929

469
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,507
既然一切都好了 我们应该
You know, we really ought to spend more time with them

470
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:10,775
多花点时间跟他们相处
now that things are all better.

471
00:19:10,842 --> 00:19:13,978
我们应该带他们去迪士尼玩
We should take a trip with them to Disney World!

472

全家都去 喜气洋洋一家人
All of us, just one big, happy family.

474
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:21,819
# 他们若要跌倒 #
If they all fall down 

475
00:19:21,887 --> 00:19:24,755

# 你依旧有我 我陪你在侧 #

谢谢你 迪克
Thank you, Dick.

479
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:40,683
# 我守护你 我守护你 #
I got you, I got you 

480
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:52,445
你没错 宝贝
You're right, babe.

481
00:19:52,513 --> 00:19:54,114
今早的火鸡鸭更美味了
The turducken is even better the morning after.

482
00:19:54,182 --> 00:19:56,483
我今年真是得了你妈填料的真传
And I really nailed your mom's stuffing recipe this year.

483
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,387

492
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:27,580
当我看到她资料 我以为我...
But when I saw her profile, I thought to myself this...

493
00:20:27,648 --> 00:20:31,217
我能与这个女人共度垂暮之年
This is the woman I could spend my twilight years

494

环游世界

495
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:34,621
天啊
God.

496
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:38,658
我们就不能把她电话给他吗?
I mean, would it kill us to pass along her phone number?

497
00:20:38,726 --> 00:20:40,927
给你

498
