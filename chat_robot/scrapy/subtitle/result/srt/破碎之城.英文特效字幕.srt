16
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He shattered that oath.

17
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The State will prove there is probable cause

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as respectable as you.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is there to discuss?

35
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It won't make it past preliminary.

36
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we should hope it does, sir.

37
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those people outside will find it very hard

38
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to believe it wasn't murder, plain and simple.

39
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's this for plain and simple?

40
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's one less homicidal rapist walking the streets.

41
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mikey Tavarez was found innocent of those charges.

42
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He walked on a technicality.

43
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We know he raped and killed Yesenia Barea.

44
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The law says differently, sir.

45
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You always this much fun, chief?

46
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,690

47
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I like getting my photo taken next to heroes.

48
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I also like winning Staten Island

49
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}without having to go there.

50
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A witness came forward this morning.

51
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are two minutes away from the judge's decision.

52
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He came forward with evidence.

53
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is it?

54
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been temporarily misplaced.

55
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The witness?

56
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A kid.

57
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is he legal?

58
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is his mother legal?

59
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find out what he wants.

60
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It appears he wants justice, sir.

61
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, nobody gets that.

62
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want, chief?

63
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want what's best for the city, sir.

64
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is the court's view

65
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that the State has failed to present a clear case..

66
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}..for why the shooting should amount to murder

67
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and not self-defense.

68
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Therefore, the defendant will not be held

69
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to answer to these charges at trial.

70
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's free to go. Court adjourned.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Detective.

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are you? Mr.Mayor.

76
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hey, chief.-Sit down, detective.

77

78
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry about the chief.

79
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We drew straws for "good cop, bad cop" and he won.

80
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does he want, to interrogate me?

81
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I just wanted to get in a room with you.

82
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted to tell you how proud I am of you.

83
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've done the city a great favor.

84
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You, in my eyes, hero.

00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's the thing.

87
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some uncomfortable evidence has come to light.

88
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it should come out, we will be fucked.

89
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is a necessity that we remain unfucked.

90
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-So..-You're done, detective.

91
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yesenia Barea was 16 years old, chief.

92
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mikey Tavarez was exonerated.

93
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And they got it wrong.-So you put it right.

94

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Billy, there's some wars you fight

97
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and some wars you walk away from.

98
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Mayor..-This is not the fighting kind.

99
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a long memory, son.

100
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,880

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is Wall Street's approved candidate.

105
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the charge from the mayor's rival,

106
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Councilman Jack Valliant,

197
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been, uh, having some rough times.

198
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,170

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Dave, Katy.

216
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what time on Monday, huh?

217
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm going to get some air.-Okay.

218
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Billy! Billy!

219
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Phone!-Take a message!

220
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the mayor.

221
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You seem nervous.

222
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's probably the bomb I got shoved up my asshole.

223
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too soon?

224
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Councilman Valliant, any comment on the Bolton Village sale?

225
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think this is a sad day for New York.

226
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never thought I'd see a mayor of this city, even this mayor,

227
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}stoop so low as to steal the homes

228
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of 30,000 hardworking New Yorkers.

229
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I will not let this sale stand

230
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when I'm elected mayor on Tuesday.

231
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is the timing of the announcement political?

232
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Absolutely, it's political.

233
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not to say Nick Hostetler doesn't care.

234
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Evidently, he cares very deeply about two things:

235
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His own job and taking care of his buddies on Wall Street.

236
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your message to the people of Bolton Village?

237
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help is on the way.

238
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come Tuesday you will have an ally in City Hall.

239
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to this guy, Mike.

240
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't even get his numbers right.

241
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bolton Village is home to 37,512.

242
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you know what this deal means for them?

243
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Valliant seems to think it means eviction, mayor.

244
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Valliant thinks.

245
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What it means is better service.

246
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It means more attentive landlords,

247
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}somebody showing up when the toilet is blocked

248
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or the heat's on the fritz.

249
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It means paint on the walls and it means windows fixed.

250
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Valliant says Solstein Donagan's going to jack up their rents,

251
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}replace them with yuppies.

252
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a great deal

253
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for the people of Bolton Village

254
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it's a great deal for the city of New York.

255
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think the announcement of this deal

256
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will add to your poll numbers?

257
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you know, Mike,

258
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if the readers of the New York Post

259
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}want to reward competence,

260
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who am I to argue with that? Excuse me.

261
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah?

262
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, obviously that was some attempt at humor.

263
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, call off the brigade. Bring him up. Thank you.

264
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Mike, get out of here.

265
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go do the people's work.

266
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Good luck Tuesday.-Thank you.

267
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look. Here's one for the car. One for the wife.

268
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And one for the kid, put it on his school bag.

269
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Thanks.-All right.

270
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Mr.Mayor.-Hey.

271
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, Billy,

272
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we take threats of terrorism very seriously around here.

273
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I..

274
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even from good Catholic boys like you.

275
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm kidding. Look at you. Looking all civilized.

276
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's good to see you, mayor.

277
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see this golden boy on your way in?

278
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I caught a glimpse.

279
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, if I'm being honest,

280
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I find it faintly insulting.

281
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, that you're running dead even with a nobody?

282
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

283
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You always were more balls than tact.

284
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm actually trying to reverse the trend.

285
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you shouldn't. It's one of your strong suits.

286
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Scotch?-Uh, I'm on the wagon, thank you.

287
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

288
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about if I just pour one for you

289
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and leave it between us like a symbol?

290
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You going to be able to put this guy away?

291
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I ever tell you about Johnny Ingrisano?

292
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think you told me that.

293
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every day, growing up in Queens,

294
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this guy would pummel me at recess.

295
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What could I do? I was just a kid.

296
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A couple of years ago,

297
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I heard Ingrisano got in legal trouble.

298
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The kind of trouble another guy could get himself out of easily.

299
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I got involved.

300
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, he scratches his ass without permission,

301
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he spends a week in Rikers.

302
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack Valliant reminds me of Johnny Ingrisano.

303
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ever do any hunting?

304
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No.-You should try it.

305
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You would be a natural. And you'd love the dogs.

306
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Women call men dogs.

307
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They mean it to suggest we're somehow

308
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}untrustworthy or disloyal.

309
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But a dog is anything but.

310
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if men are dogs,

311
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what the goddamn hell does that make women?

312
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ever seen a bitch in heat?

313
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She'll grind herself across the grass

314
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to try and get at that itch.

315
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if she can sneak out of the backyard,

316
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}any dog will do.

317
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not sure I'm following you, mayor.

318
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you to help me find the son of a bitch

319
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who's fucking my wife.

320
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think she's having an affair?

321
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know she's having an affair.

322
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you should call the Post and confirm.

323
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's smarter than that.

324
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So is he.

325
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's like a goddamn phantom.

326
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe he doesn't exist.

327
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I still want the pictures. I want to know who he is.

328
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to know where he's from.

329
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to know how big his dick is, how long he lasts,

330
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where do they fuck. In hotels or his place?

331
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to know if he makes her come,

332
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or if she fakes it with him too.

333
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I want to know everything by election day.

334
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's it got to do with the election?

335
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}New Yorkers, they've elected drunks, crooks,

336
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Italians, homos, Jews and blacks to that seat.

337
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they will not elect is some guy whose wife

338
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is fucking some other guy behind his back.

339
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now this pussy, this Jack Valliant,

340
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he may be too much of a lightweight

341
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to use this story if it comes across his desk.

342
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But his staff will not hesitate.

343
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if she doesn't see him before Tuesday?

344
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then it's gonna be the easiest $50,000 you ever made.

345
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Half now, half later.

346
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Half right now?

347
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right this instant. What do you say?

348
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I say yes.

349
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get me what I need.

350
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will, mayor. Consider it done.

351
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can get my wife's schedule from Valerie on the way out, hm?

352
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something wrong?

353
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you called, I didn't think it would be

354
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for something like this.

355
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

356
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neither did I.

357
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Billy.

358
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome back.

359
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, mayor.

360
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Have you got time for breakfast?-Baby, have you seen my keys?

361
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On the table, by your hot sauce collection.

362
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It looks like we can do L.A. in style.

363
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I landed a big contract, I got some cushion now.

364
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That sounds great.

365
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll text you the details for the cast dinner tomorrow.

366
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm not going to that.

367
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those guys take that metrosexual shit way too far.

368
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't give a fuck if you want to be

369
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a thespian or a lesbian.

370
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when a man whips out a compact

371
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and a powder puff at dinner, that's no good.

372
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you pretend to be interested?

373
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just one night, please.

374
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not every day your girlfriend stars

375

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in her first indie film.

376
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you ask me nicely.

377
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you please?

378
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

379
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put some powder on me, so I don't feel left out.

380
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No.-Okay.

00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I feel uncomfortable around those people.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen, the First Lady of New York,

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Equality has finally come to New York.

386
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some said that now wasn't the right time

387
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to wage this fight.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to fight for what is rightfully yours.

390

00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to stand up to the bullies.

392
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even if they're powerful bullies.

393
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Especially if they're powerful bullies.

00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That just makes the victory so much sweeter.

00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I did not.

00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I read the Post, like the rest of New York.

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Interesting editorial.

431
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,510

432
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this what you do all day?

433
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spy on beautiful women in swanky restaurants?

434
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you consider the finer bodegas of Bensonhurst swanky.

435
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should do this more often. It's time you earned your keep.

436
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does that mean I get paid this month?

437
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep. Soon as I see that phone bill.

438
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's my brother. What do you want?

439
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Send him a phone card.

440
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:23,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I should, right?

441
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doing all right?

442
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know.

443
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sing Sing ain't no place for guys with good hearts.

444
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why'd the mayor call you?

445
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's grabbing her things.

446
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Shit. What do I do?-Calm down. Look at me.

447
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smile. Attagirl.

448
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stand up. Get your coat. Keep smiling and talking.

449
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-My heart is pounding.-Purse.

450
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come here.

451
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,320

452
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then get across the street so you can cover her.

453
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Call me when you got her.-Okay.

454
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Katy, what do we have?

455
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uptown on Madison, towards 45th. She picked up a bodyguard.

456
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep at her pace.

457
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, she just took a call.

458
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-BlackBerry?-It's a flip phone.

459
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you to get in closer.

460
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get me a name, Katy. A place, a time, something.

461
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

462
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:22,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. I understand. So, uh, what time, darling?

463
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be there.

464
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's him. She's arranging a meeting.

465
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got her.

466
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I'll be there soon.

467
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go.

468
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ma'am! Ma'am! Wait. Sorry.

469
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's yours. I think you dropped this.

470
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yes, thank you.-Oh, you're welcome.

471
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Should we follow her?

472
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, she'll figure we were here soon enough.

473
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find out who this number belongs to.

474
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he drives a Lexus, we got our guy.

475
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome back to the Roosevelt, Mrs.Hostetler.

476

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Kenny.

477

478
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I got him. And it's good, Billy.

479
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:12,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How good?-Ah. Wondrous good.

480
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They teach you that at DeVry?

481
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I go to Hunter, asshole.-Oh, pardon me.

482
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a sophisticated place. I got sophisticated friends.

483
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We read books, drink wine.

484
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You old enough to drink?

485
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'd be surprised what I'm old enough to do.

486
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, easy.

487
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For example, I'm old enough to vote.

488
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It might come of some interest when casting my ballot

489
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to know that Jack Valliant's campaign manager,

490
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:41,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a guy named Paul Andrews, is fucking the mayor's wife.

491
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:45,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bullshit. And he drives a Lexus.

492
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is good.

493
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's borderline orgasmic, Billy.

494
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You learn that at Hunter too?

495
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wouldn't you like to know?

496
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not gonna go over good with the mayor.

497
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:02,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is a cold bitch.

498
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your attention, please.

499
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All luggage and parcels must be attended at all times.

500
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Montauk. Round trip. Peak.

501
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

502
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa!

503
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How you looking against the kid?

504
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:09,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The numbers are holding steady.

505
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Steady?-Yeah.

506
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What the fuck does that mean?-Steady is a prelude to a shift, okay?

507
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In what direction?

508
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:20,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The incumbent, Sam. Always to the incumbent.

509
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

510
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A little slow, Nick.

511
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? You watch your ass, I'll take care of mine.

512
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm beginning to wonder if you can.

513
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like Griffith and Paret in '62.

514
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Emile Griffith and Benny Paret, remember that?

515
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah.-So the kid is Paret,

516
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Griffith.

517
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean you're the fag?

518
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am Griffith minus the fag angle.

519
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm holding back.

520
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:58,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm making him think he's got it won.

521
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then comes the 12th round. Remember that?

522
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

523
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-The kill shot.-Fuck you.

524
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, Nick,

525
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:15,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got a half a million sunk in your campaign

526
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and a lot more riding on the result.

527
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So why don't you just tell me

528
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how you're going to win this thing?

529
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have dirt dropping on the news desks

530
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of every paper and every network

531
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}across the city tonight.

532
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will it stick?

533
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it won't stick. It's all bullshit.

534
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it will smudge.

535
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That will get the undecideds thinking,

536
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:51,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Sunday night at the debate, I will put him away.

537
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you better, Nick.

538
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just better.

539
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know who you're voting for?

540
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think I'll make it to the polls.

541
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I try to vote for president, but..

542
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:16,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}President doesn't determine the quality of life in Brooklyn.

543
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd you know I was from Brooklyn?

544
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just told me you were from Brooklyn.

545
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm in the business of picking up on these things.

546
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you, a private eye?

547
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:31,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Private eye? Private eyes still exist?

548
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you do, then?

549
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm in politics.

550
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-So why do you recommend?-I recommend the new guy.

551
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, come on, he's too clean.

552
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}New York's this big, messy place.

553
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does it have to be?

554
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It could be better,

555
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but it's been pretty good under Hostetler.

556
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you do, then?

557
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I work sanitation.

558
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You clean up pretty well for a garbage man.

559
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm doing it to impress a lady.

560
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, it's always a lady.

561
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Local 831?

562
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah, 15 years.-Fifteen years.

563
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You own a home?

564
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-In New York?-Exactly.

565
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So why is it that you, a union man,

566
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I take it a native New Yorker..

567
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is it that you don't own your own home in the city?

568
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But yet every Bernie and Gordon

569
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who get off this train with an MBA and no scruples,

570
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they own one?

571
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They own one in the city and on the island.

572
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So where is yours?

573
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just saying.

574
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you own a house out here?

575
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No. No, don't get me wrong.

576
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like the water and sand and grass, but no.

577
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only thing better than getting out of that city

578
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is going back.

579
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just about everything and anyone I love is in that city.

580
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The next and final stop will be Montauk.

581
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All passengers must depart the train.

582
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gather all personal belongings.

583
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Nice talking to you.-You too.

584
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Again, the next and last stop..

585
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit.

586
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taggart Agency.

587
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Were you on the other line?

588
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm trying to save your business.

589
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't get to say this often, but you were right.

590
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

591
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:24,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The mayor's wife is fucking the campaign manager.

592
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Told you.-Call the mayor.

593
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Tell him I got pictures.-Okay.

594
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And stay off the fucking phone.-I wasn't..

595
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like music

596
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ryan, I wouldn't even be in this movie

597
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if it wasn't for you, so thank you.

598
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was really sweet.

599
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm, this guy here, we got a real civilian.

600
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, William, tell us. What do you do?

601
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't do anything important.

602
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I take pictures. It's very boring.

603
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit. You're not paparazzi, are you?

604
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:56,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I actually, uh, mostly stick to real people, so..

605
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Billy is a private investigator. He used to be a cop.

606
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Get out of here.-That's how you two met?

607
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You promised not to write her a ticket

608
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if she goes out with you.

609
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, something like that.

610
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Details, details.

611
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Billy.

612
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd a guy like you end up with a girl like Natalie?

613
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A guy like me?

614
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't imagine you're big on theater.

615
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, this is your guys' party. Let's talk about your movie.

616
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one leaves this table

617
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}without singing the blues, Billy.

618
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Natalie, pick up the slack.

619
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd you meet this charming guy?

620
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Billy was a friend of the family.

621
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You lived in the same neighborhood?

622
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He worked by where I lived.

623
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You fell in love with the neighborhood policeman?

624
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

625
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were a bunch of broke Puerto Ricans

626
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}nobody gave a damn about. Billy was good to us.

627
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Barrow. Is that Puerto Rican?

628
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's actually Barea.

629
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Natalie Barea.

630
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Natalia.

631
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That has a nice ring to it.

632
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:53,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You changed it so you could play more Anglo?

633
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

634
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I changed it because I was tired of going to auditions

635
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the first question out of the casting director's mouth

636
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was if I was related to Yesenia Barea.

637
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's that?

638
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My sister.

639
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is she famous or something?

640
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Her face was in all the papers seven years ago.

641
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nat, please..

642
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beautiful 16-year-old girl,

643
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}raped and beaten to death

644
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in an apartment in Bolton Village.

645
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Billy was good to us.

646
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:32,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a really hard time and he made it better.

647
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure, that's because you like to accuse anyone

648
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who doesn't let the rich off, of engaging in class warfare

649
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when in reality,

650
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you know full well what real class warfare is.

651
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's stealing homes of working people

652
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and handing them over at a cut rate

653
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to an investment bank.

654
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That, sir, is real class warfare.

655
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe where you grew up in Connecticut,

656
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$3 billion is considered cut-rate.

657
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But here in New York City,

658
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$3 billion is a lot of money

659
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that can solve a lot of problems.

660
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't solve problems

661
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by bending over for billionaires.

662
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I may bend over for billionaires,

663
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you come from a long line of them.

664
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are the renovations coming on that $4 million townhouse

665
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in Brooklyn Heights?

666
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want my house too? Take it.

667
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm upside-down on my mortgage like the rest of this city.

668
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:27,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because the system has been rigged by men like you.

669
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck, that's good.

670
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yeah?-You make that stick,

671
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you pull undecideds off the fence.

672
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

673
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need that moment, Paul.

674
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:43,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That "You are no Jack Kennedy" moment.

675
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It has to be Bolton Village related.

676
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stick to the issues,

677
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}people will see the difference between you two.

678
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not clean enough, Paul. It's gotta be clean cut.

679
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got this clear line of attack on me.

680
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the rich Connecticut carpetbagger.

681
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell is he?

682
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's out of a job,

683
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you stick to the fucking issues.

684
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're missing the point. He's a crook!

685
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to hammer that home

686
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when he taunts me about my family money

687
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Harvard and the rest.

688
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to be able to lay his fat ass flat.

689
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"You, sir, are a crook. And a liar."

690
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if tries to challenge me to prove it,

691
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I pull out that glorious piece of paper

692
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you said you'd provide me with and read it out loud.

693
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, let's take 10. Can I talk to you?

694
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, so what's your problem, Jack?

695
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Daily News is my problem, Paul.

696
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Post, The Times, they're all the same.

697
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hostetler's backing up a dump truck of shit on me

698
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:36,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and our campaign has piss-all in the way of pushback.

699
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought that's what Montauk was for.

700
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about your source?

701
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm working on it.-So that's why you disappeared for nine hours?

702
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He kept us waiting, I told you.

703
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You came back stinking of booze.

704
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had a fucking cocktail, sweetheart.

705
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So where's our pushback?

706
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our pushback are truth and facts, Jack.

707
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's how we play.

708
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are our headlines? That's all I want to know.

709
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell you something..We don't need headlines, Jack.

710
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because we're winning.

711
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:02,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even their internal polling has us up by three.

712
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're winning on your own terms.

713
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But let me tell you something.

714
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You go on that debate stage and try to win that debate

715
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by going negative blow to negative blow,

716
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he will fucking destroy you.

717
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Understand that.

718
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Glad you got so much faith in me, Paul.

719
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,370

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You try having some.

721
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just do me a favor. Do your job.

722
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get me that file.

723

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir.

724
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Murdock.

725
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You save some for the rest of us, will you?

726
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Billy Taggart, holy shit. What are you doing here?

727
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was in the neighborhood.

728

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me too.

729
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You club a herd of penguins for that getup?

730
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:01,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What can I say? Private sector's good to me.

731
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You a shamus?-No, security.

732

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rich kid. Pop tears down buildings.

735
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And wants him to run the business one day.

736
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm making sure he stays on the straight and narrow.

737
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How you doing, Mr.Mayor?-Tony, how are you?

738

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and take the business from your old man?

746
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I die and he grows a pair.

747
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:43,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit.

748
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some fucking party, huh?

749
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd rather be home watching the Knicks.

750
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do what, lose?

751
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:52,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the best game in town. You got the commissioner over there.

752
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the worst-kept secret

753
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}him and the mayor can't stand each other.

754
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the commish don't miss a party.

755
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like watching Italian opera.

756
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you know about opera?

757
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just because I don't understand the language

758
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}don't mean they ain't out to fuck each other.

759
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Suite 5101, Mr.Taggart. I'm told it's urgent.

760
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me.

761
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the neighborhood, my ass.

762
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:37,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May I offer you a drink, Mr.Taggart?

763
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't drink.

764
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you used to. I can tell.

765
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How?

766
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By those three seconds you let pass

767
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before turning down the drink.

768
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long has it been?

769
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seven years.

770
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good for you.

771
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finally hit rock bottom, huh?

772
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did it to keep a woman.

773
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you do believe in love.

774
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe in loving the one you're with.

775
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you, stupid or Catholic?

776
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Both.

777
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To your health, Mr.Taggart.

778
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps you could explain what I'm doing up here.

779
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Being tailed is exhausting.

780
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:26,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I might pry,

781
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how much are you being paid for your efforts?

782
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which efforts are those?

783
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:33,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The work you're doing for the mayor.

784
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll give you $50,000 to give it up

785
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's very generous,

786
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:40,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I got a contract with the mayor.

787
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Break it.

788
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't break contract with the mayor.

789
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't I know it.

790
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you just leave him?

791
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not what you think it is, Mr.Taggart.

792
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I take pictures. I don't get paid to think.

793
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:55,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If the last seven years of your life mean anything,

794
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if that woman you put down the bottle for means anything,

795
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}walk away.

796
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because if you think you're investigating adultery

797
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you don't know Nicholas Hostetler very well.

798
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see you've met Billy.

799
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, we met.

800
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did he tell you he's working for me?

801
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He mentioned it.

802
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:31,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Did he mention it was exclusive?-Yes, he did.

803
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You used to know what "exclusive" meant.

804
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In this case, it means I worked for it.

805
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep your grubby little paws off it.

806
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Poor Nicky.

807
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never did learn how to share,

808
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}did you?

809
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry,

810
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll teach you before it's too late.

811
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Careful, dear.

812
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You too, darling.

813
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr.Taggart, please take care.

814
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need a drink.

815
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have you got for me?

816
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:16,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, I think I need a few more days.

817
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got things nailed down,

818
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I need another 48 hours to confirm.

819
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have an envelope of photographs in your pocket.

820
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:32,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That I paid for. Right? Right?

821
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Burning a hole in your bleeding heart?

822
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good work.

823
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:03,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Billy, we're done.

824
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Ryan, you excited tonight?

825
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! Wow!

826
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000


827
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000


828
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,000


829
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love the line between the sky and the water.

830
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see how it gets darker the farther it is away,

831
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just a line separating sky from water.

832
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's religious. I get it.

833
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's got to have hope,

834
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}have something to believe in.

835
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you have to bring him up?

836
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does it matter?

837
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not everything in this life is black and white.

838
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's not talk about him anymore.

839
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

840
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}*Y'all gonna make me Lose my mind*

843
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:59,830

848

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Excuse me.-Yeah.

849
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:17,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Can I get a double Jameson?-You got it.

850

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}*How the fuck you gonna cross The dog*

851

928
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:41,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What's it look like?-So far, so good on robbery.

929
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He didn't have a wallet on him

930
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but his apartment's right here,

00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so maybe he left it inside.

932
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're working to get the landlord down here

935
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:50,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No keys, no cash.

936
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like I said, so far, so good on robbery.

937
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So when's the last time you seen one of these?

938
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:06,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not really thinking robbery?

939
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:09,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we're spinning robbery. Media's pushing robbery.

940
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a counterfactual robbery.

941
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now it's your turn, Taggart.

942
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell this got to do with you?

943
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:16,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's funny, Billy.

944
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:19,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just about to ask you that my damn self.

945
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, stay with me, Billy. This is what I got.

946
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:28,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a former N.Y.P.D. detective-turned private eye

947
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}at a fund-raiser for the mayor.

948
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:32,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If his mother's life depended on it,

949
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he couldn't find the money to afford a ticket.

950
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's Thursday. Then, this is the good part.

951
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Twenty-four hours later, at the murder scene of the man

952
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}running the campaign to unseat the mayor, poof.

953
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Imagine, that very same private eye.

954
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Explain that to me, Billy.

955
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this Hostetler?

956
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this what you gave him last night?

957
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gave him Andrews?

958
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I gave him pictures.-You gave him pictures?

959
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who were the pictures of?-His wife.

960
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-His wife and who?-I can't tell you that.

961
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:05,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You better start telling me something.

962
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:08,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Explain to me what are you doing at my crime scene.

963
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was in the neighborhood.

964
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were just in the neighborhood?

965
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:14,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paul Andrews is dead.

966
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think you're just gonna piss on him and walk away?

967
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is an execution.

968
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:22,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a fucking assassination. Did you finger Andrews?

969
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:25,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This what you do now, Billy, set up executions?

970
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Fuck you.-Fuck me?

971
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck you. I took a job, chief.

972
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't ask questions.

973
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gave him pictures and I walked away.

974
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you think I gave him up to get murdered?

975
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you're too damn smart to think you would set him up..

976
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:39,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck you. I did my job.

978
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:44,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Commissioner.-Get out of here.

979
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me tell you something, Billy.

980
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:49,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm taking Hostetler down.

981
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:50,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He sees election day,

982
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:53,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it'll be from inside a cage, like a monkey.

983
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:55,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, you either help me,

984
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:58,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or you'll be in there with him sucking on bananas too.

985
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

986
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Commissioner, there's an issue.

987
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:09,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something up, commissioner?

988
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're on the door. Nobody gets in here.

989

991
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened tonight, Jack?

992
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry about him, he's with me.

993
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone's with you.

994
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:48,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you to look at me, Jack.

995
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:50,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Talk to me, okay?

996
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put the whiskey down, Jack. Okay?

997
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Jack?

998
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:03,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

999
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to straighten up, Jack.

1000
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lock the door.

1001
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna be okay, Jack.

1002
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just tell me exactly what happened.

1003
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:33,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, you're not a real cop.

1004
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're just a whore.

1005
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:57,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna go for a walk and get some fresh air.

1006
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll feel better, okay?

1007
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry about that, all right?

1008
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna help you, Jack.

1009
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I have to know what happened tonight,

1010
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we don't have a lot of time.

1011
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you to talk to me, understand?

1012
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm done talking to you, fucking whore.

1013
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:12,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're talking, but not making sense.

1014
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:13,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clear his mind, Billy.

1015
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1016
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He went, um, downstairs

1017
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:47,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to meet Todd Lancaster.

1018
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'd called earlier

1019
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:55,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he told Paul he was ready to talk.

1020
00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:01,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said he was ashamed of himself for helping us,

1021
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:04,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but he was, um..

1022
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was more ashamed of his father

1023
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:10,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and just wanted it to stop.

1024
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think Paul lost track of time

1025
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:19,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because he looked at the clock and he, um,

1026
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:23,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just ran downstairs.

1027
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was, uh..

1028
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was the last time I saw him.

1029
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:35,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you hear any voices outside? An altercation, maybe?

1030
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1031
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just the shots.

1032
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew I couldn't go out there.

1033
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:51,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew I couldn't call the police,

1034
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:53,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}couldn't be seen here.

1035
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew everything I couldn't do

1036
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:01,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that Jack Valliant, candidate for mayor,

1037
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:04,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}couldn't do.

1038
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what this means, Jack?

1039
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:12,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it means I let him lie out there.

1040
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:19,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It means I let him die alone.

1041
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:20,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It means you can handle this.

1042
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at me, Jack.

1043
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:28,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are gonna be the next mayor of New York City.

1044
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got to handle this.

1045
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:33,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, you go get dressed.

1046
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find yourself a hat and a coat with a collar.

1047
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're gonna get you out of here, real quiet.

1048
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:45,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah? Right.

1049
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:47,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hostetler.

1050
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gotta get him out of here.

1051
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:51,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm on my way.

1052
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:53,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How involved are you?

1053
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:56,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's complicated.

1054
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He gave me a day to gather my bearings.

1055
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll talk.

1056
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:36,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What a fucking mess.-A tragedy, sir.

1057
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:42,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The press will want heads to roll over this.

1058
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:44,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I beg your pardon, sir?

1059
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:47,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know how it goes.

1060
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We either give them an arrest or a resignation.

1061
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we'll have to give them an arrest.

1062
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tragedy in the West Village.

1063

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for mayoral candidate Jack Valliant,

1065
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:05,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was found shot to death

1066
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}outside his Jane Street apartment.

1067
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:11,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Police questioned witnesses, but no suspects were detained.

1068
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Police Commissioner Carl Fairbanks,

1069
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:16,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a personal friend of Andrews, says the investigation

1070
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:19,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will receive the department's highest priority.

1071
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was a better man than me.

1072
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He should have been mayor.

1073
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:40,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and Andrews, you were, uh, together?

1074
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:45,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's this quote I remember. I don't know where I heard it.

1075
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:47,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just always remember it.

1076
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe something I read in undergrad.

1077
01:01:55,870 --> 01:02:00,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"And it's just not popular or safe

1078
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:02,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to say that I loved him."

1079
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you spoken to Councilman Valliant?

1080
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:34,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have. I reached out this morning.

1081
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I offered him not only my deepest condolences,

1082
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:40,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but my personal assurance that we will do all we can

1083
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice.

1084
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you know Paul Andrews?

1085
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:49,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I only met Mr.Andrews a few times.

1086
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He always struck me as a very genuine man,

1087
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:54,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and a very hardworking man.

1088
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He loved the city, he loved the people.

1089
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:02,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He and my wife actually were good friends.

1090
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So this definitely hits home.

1091
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:06,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you all very much.

1092
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of man Paul Andrews was?

1093
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:09,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang on a minute.

1094
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:13,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The kind of man who loved and fought with his whole heart.

1095
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:15,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was a dear friend to all of us,

1096
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:18,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the driving force behind this campaign.

1097
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:20,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He will be dearly missed.

1098
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This must be an extremely difficult time.

1099
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:24,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you considered suspending your campaign?

1100
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, absolutely not.

1101
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The debate will continue as scheduled tomorrow.

1102
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The, uh, election on Tuesday.

1103
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:34,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We refuse to allow some thug to prevent this city

1104
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:36,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from exercising its democratic rights.

1105
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1106
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:41,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paul Andrews definitely wasn't fucking the mayor's wife.

1107
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're looking for a guy named Todd Lancaster.

1108
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:48,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just find what you can on him and Bolton Village.

1109
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:49,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dig up whatever you can on the sale.

1110
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. I'm on it.

1111
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Billy.

1112
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:05,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know it's not your fault.

1113
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:15,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta go.

1114
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:51,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, he just walked into Bolton Village.

1115
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:53,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir.

1116
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:07,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drop the gun, Mikey! Drop the fucking gun!

1117
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chill, man. I didn't do nothing!

1118
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chill, man, what the fuck?

1119
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:15,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay, Mikey. We just want to talk.

1120
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:02,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Billy, hey.

1121
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:07,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Oh, Billy, come in,-Hola.-come in.

1122
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. Where is Natalia?

1123
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:13,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, I came alone, Mrs.Barea.

1124
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:15,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's been really busy with the movie.

1125
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Yes, the movie.

1126
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:29,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Billy. It's good to see you.

1127
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You too.

1128
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's good to see you.

1129
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what brings you back to the old neighborhood?

1130
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:47,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a good question. I'm not really sure.

1131
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nostalgia can be hard to explain.

1132
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:51,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1133
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:57,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, is everything all right between you and my daughter?

1134
01:06:57,090 --> 01:06:59,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Good.

1135
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:03,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why'd you stay here, Raul?

1136
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:07,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where would we go?

1137
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anywhere. I mean, I never got it.

1138
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Natalie never got it. How could you stay here?

1139
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:17,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I could never leave my Yesenia behind.

1140
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's gone, Raul.

1141
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:20,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Billy, no.

1142
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:22,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She is here.

1143
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:29,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I know how much you gave up that night.

1144
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:32,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you also gave us peace.

1145
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:40,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you gave Yesenia justice, huh?

1146
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:43,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I can't begin to tell you

1147
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:47,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how much that means to me and my wife.

1148
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:54,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, Billy,

1149
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}have you seen this movie?

1150
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:09,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Raise your arms.

1151
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kevin.

1152
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give us a few moments.

1153
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:19,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Thank you for meeting me, Mrs.Hostetler.-What do you want?

1154
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna know what's going on.

1155
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:23,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you wanna know what's going on now?

1156
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:26,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You couldn't care less the other night.

1157
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:29,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paul Andrews was my friend, Mr.Taggart.

1158
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you understand that?

1159
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My very dear friend.

1160
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:38,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if you weren't such a cut-rate dick,

1161
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:42,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}maybe he would still be alive today.

1162
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:44,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you are cut-rate.

1163
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:47,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're cheap to hire and you're cheaper to throw away.

1164
01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:51,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gave you the opportunity to do the right thing

1165
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you refused.

1166
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right.

1167
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm sorry about your friend, Mrs.Hostetler.

1168
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your husband set me up.

1169
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:01,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'm gonna destroy him for it.

1170
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you to understand that.

1171
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:05,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll do whatever it takes

1172
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:06,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to bring that son of a bitch down.

1173
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But first, you have to tell me what's going on.

1174
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:14,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You weren't hired to look for my lover, Mr.Taggart.

1175
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:16,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were looking for my source.

1176
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:21,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I discovered some information about the mayor a while back.

1177
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:25,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it was ever brought to light, it would ruin him.

1178
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:26,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I offered him a deal.

1179
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:30,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get a divorce, a reasonable settlement,

1180
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:32,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he gets my silence.

1181
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He didn't take the deal.

1182
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:36,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. He hired you.

1183
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:39,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was Paul.

1184
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:44,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paul gave me the information.

1185
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He thought by sharing it with me,

1186
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he would help me in my situation

1187
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:51,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I could help him by looking into it from my side.

1188
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looking into what?

1189
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:54,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Bolton Village sale.

1190
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Four billion dollars is a hell of a lot of money

1191
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:59,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for a few city blocks of housing projects,

1192
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:02,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-wouldn't you say?-Yeah.

1193
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's worth twice that.

1194
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He's a dangerous man, Billy.-No.

1195
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:10,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He only knows people that kill people.

1196
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What you got, Katy?

1197
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A hit on Todd Lancaster.

1198
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:26,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He works for his father Sam's construction

1199
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:30,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and demolition company called the Rochway Group.

1200
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:32,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sam is one of the mayor's biggest donors,

1201
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:33,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which is interesting,

1202
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:36,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because Todd is like besties with Paul Andrews.

1203
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or, uh, he was, sorry.

1204
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:41,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andrews was an alumni mentor to Todd at Columbia.

1205
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He took him under his wing,

1206
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:44,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now they serve on a bunch of boards

1207
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:46,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for all these, like, liberal organizations.

1208
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anyway, I got a home address for Todd

1209
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}out in Port Washington,

1210
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:51,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but the office is by the Navy Yard,

1211
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:53,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so maybe you wanna try there first.

1212
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:57,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, Billy, just be careful, all right?

1213
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:58,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paul Andrews was just murdered.

1214
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure it's gonna be a shitstorm out there.

1215
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:04,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're kidding me. You gotta be..

1216
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in here. Get in here, you idiot.

1217
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:43,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are dead to me. Look at me, you little sissy.

1218
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:46,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You're dead to me.-Stop fucking hitting me!

1219
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:49,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the reason this is happening.

1220
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:52,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the reason? Get him out of here!

1221
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get your fucking ape off of me!

1222
01:12:56,580 --> 01:13:01,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop the shredding! Just get this shit off of here!

1223
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit!

1224
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:30,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

1225
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:47,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

1226
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:56,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, fuck.

1227
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:33,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you got insurance.

1228
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:34,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The other guy didn't leave his information?

1229
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:38,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No, but we'll get him.-How you gonna manage that?

1230
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:40,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That camera over there.

1231
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long it take to get that footage?

1232
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:47,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Depends. You got a powerful uncle?

1233
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:48,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I might.

1234
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:55,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for calling the Roosevelt Hotel.

1235
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:57,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you say?

1236
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Roosevelt Hotel.

1237
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:00,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm looking for a Carl Fairbanks.

1238
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:02,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, sir,

1239
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but the commissioner hasn't set up his voicemail.

1240
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-May I take a message?-We done here?

1241
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:08,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we're good.

1242
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Found a little trouble tonight, huh, Billy?

1243
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you could call it that.

1244
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:29,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave the bottle, Harry.

1245
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You come here often?

1246
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:39,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You trying to get in my drawers, Billy, eh?

1247
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's next, you're gonna ask me my sign?

1248
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:43,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I bet you're the one with two fucking faces.

1249
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:47,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, Gemini? Close, Billy. I'm the bull.

1250
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:51,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What about you?-Cancer.

1251
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Roosevelt, huh?

1252
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:57,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pretty choice address for a cop, even if he is commissioner.

1253
01:15:57,210 --> 01:16:00,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I made some sound investments.-Oh, I bet you did.

1254
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:01,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not to mention the place on Montauk.

1255
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:04,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That must have set you back a few mil.

1256
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:06,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You the new Russell Simmons now?

1257
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:07,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You doing yoga and fucking white women?

1258
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:09,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's cute, Billy.

1259
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:11,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me something, commissioner.

1260
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is the First Lady upstairs right now?

1261
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:16,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be careful, Billy.

1262
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:20,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that's why you were so concerned about those pictures.

1263
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were afraid you were in them.

1264
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:24,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why you took me upstairs, not Jansen.

1265
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What do you want?-I want Hostetler.

1266
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:28,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in line.

1267
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:32,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I almost had him tonight. Papers in my trunk.

1268
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A fucking box full of mark-ups,

1269
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}renderings of some New York skyline

1270
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:37,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that doesn't exist right now,

1271
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:38,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but will once they tear down Bolton Village.

1272
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some goon blindsided me.

1273
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:42,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We ID'd him from his license plate.

1274
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is he?

1275
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:47,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ex-homicide cop. Dick Murdock. You know him?

1276
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:49,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, he works for Sam Lancaster.

1277
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:51,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He might work for Sam Lancaster,

1278
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but he's on Hostetler's payroll.

1279
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:54,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say again?

1280
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That paperwork you got in your trunk,

1281
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:57,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not to diminish your new beauty mark,

1282
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is fucking worthless.

1283
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone knows Solstein Donagan

1284
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:04,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is gonna tear down Bolton Village.

1285
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:07,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A few know they hired the Rochway Group to do it.

1286
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:10,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So why is Paul Andrews dead if it was such an open secret?

1287
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:12,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, he was about to figure out the rest.

1288
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:15,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What "rest"? What fucking "rest"?

1289
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:17,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't anybody in this town

1290
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:19,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}speak in complete fucking sentences anymore?

1291
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:23,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Todd Lancaster was meeting with Andrews that night

1292
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to bring him a contract.

1293
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody didn't want that to happen.

1294
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:31,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I myself almost secured the contract from Todd,

1295
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:33,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but now he's not talking.

1296
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's scared.

1297
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:37,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, the contract is proof of the deal

1298
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to tear down Bolton Village.

1299
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's part of it.

1300
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:47,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Only Todd Lancaster knows the other part.

1301
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:50,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Harry.

1302
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:52,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever he wants, on me.

1303
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, commissioner.

1304
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:56,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, commissioner.

1305
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Places, everyone.

1306
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:07,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're live in five.

1307
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good evening, New York.

1308
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:16,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to the third and final New York City mayoral debate.

1309
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:18,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At this time, join me in welcoming our candidates,

1310
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:21,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mayor Nicholas Hostetler and Councilman Jack Valliant.

1311
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:33,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. How much?

1312
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Manual windows?-Yeah.

1313
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's how you got those masculine forearms.

1314
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do you think, from stroking your ego?

1315
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:43,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big booty, good. Big forearms, no good.

1316
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Let me drive. What the fuck?

1317
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:47,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Asshole!-I didn't do it on purpose.

1318
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:49,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Let me drive.-Oh, my God!

1319
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:51,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ruin my car before you even drive it.

1320
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I apologize.-Where are we going again?

1321
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:55,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Don't worry about it. Get in.-What do you think I'm doing?

1322
01:18:55,890 --> 01:18:57,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, where'd you get these seat covers,

1323
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Gaza Strip?

1324
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:00,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In a Valliant administration,

1325
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:03,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we will be focusing on two key principles:

1326
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shared responsibility and shared sacrifice.

1327
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For those of you who were fortunate enough

1328
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:11,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to earn more than $200,000 a year,

1329
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll ask that you pay a little more in taxes.

1330
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:16,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For those of you who don't,

1331
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}well, we'll bring down the payroll tax.

1332
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:19,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's responsible and it moves us forward

1333
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:21,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}towards a balanced budget, and a secure future.

1334
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:24,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mayor.

1335
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:27,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it is laughable that my opponent can be up here

1336
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:31,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}espousing fiscal responsibility when it is a known fact

1337
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he has never met a tax he didn't want to raise.

1338
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:37,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This coming from the man whose policies landed us

1339
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:38,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in a billion-dollar deficit.

1340
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:42,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is coming from the mayor who got us out of it.

1341
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:45,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By selling people's homes out from underneath them.

1342
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By selling public housing to a Wall Street equity firm.

1343
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:51,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe the residents of Bolton Village

1344
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:52,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}would have much preferred a tax increase

1345
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:54,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to an eviction notice.

1346
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:57,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Councilman, no matter where a New Yorker lives,

1347
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:00,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}nobody wants a tax increase.

1348
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:01,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nor do I.

1349
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time you told the truth about the Bolton Village deal.

1350
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:09,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's the truth. We have a $3 billion surplus.

1351
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:13,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can use that to put our people back to work.

1352
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:17,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can use that to bring tax relief to folks.

1353
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:18,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the truth.

1354
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:21,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, that's not the truth. Not even close to the truth.

1355
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:24,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You made a sweetheart deal with Solstein Donagan

1356
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:25,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to line your own pockets.

1357
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:30,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To buy your way out of a deficit your broken policies created.

1358
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:31,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The truth is you continue to lie

1359
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:35,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to the good people of this city about their intentions.

1360
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Solstein Donagan did not buy Bolton Village

1361
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:39,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to get into the landlord business.

1362
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Solstein Donagan bought Bolton Village

1363
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:43,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to get into the skyline business,

1364
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:44,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}pure and simple.

1365
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Peter, we've gone into the area of slander.

1366
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:49,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Solstein Donagan, in their 50-year history,

1367
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}has never bought a property intended for residential use

1368
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:55,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I highly doubt they intend to start now.

1369
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:58,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know how much clearer I can make it for you.

1370
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To the people of Bolton Village,

1371
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:03,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there is only one reason I got into this deal.

1372
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:05,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I want better for you.

1373
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:08,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is a new day dawning in Bolton Village.

1374
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if Solstein Donagan,

1375
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if they step out of line,

1376
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:13,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if they don't fulfill their promises,

1377
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:17,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then I will smack them back into shape.

1378
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:19,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is my oath.

1379
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:21,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unfortunately for you, mayor,

1380
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we're all well aware of what that oath is worth.

1381
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fact remains, the debt is gone.

1382
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:27,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are other ways to move us towards solvency.

1383
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Name one. Besides larceny?

1384
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:30,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tell you what I would have done.

1385
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First of all, I would have done something

1386
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:34,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my opponent clearly feels is beneath him,

1387
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:37,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that is to seek the counsel of my betters

1388
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on this crucial issue.

1389
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:40,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would've convened a panel of..

1390
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:43,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Respected economists..to help us solve this.

1391
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:45,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We all know about that panel.

1392
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That same panel put us into default in the '80s.

1393
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}New Yorkers need more than a panel.

1394
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:51,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They want solutions.

1395
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:53,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And there is only one person up on this stage

1396
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:55,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the business of providing solutions.

1397
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:58,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The other one who's up here is in the business of saying

1398
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}how dire the situation is. Is this a debate?

1399
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:04,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are we being treated to a Nick Hostetler soliloquy?

1400
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The issue is dire.

1401
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:08,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because you and your cronies have rigged the game.

1402
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:11,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honest, hardworking New Yorkers recognize

1403
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that nothing will change.

1404
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:15,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing will ever change

1405
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:17,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if we continue to elect men like this.

1406
01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:19,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me things have not changed.

1407
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:23,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When I was elected mayor, this was a broken city.

1408
01:22:23,930 --> 01:22:25,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Broken.

1409
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Step by step, I've been getting it fixed.

1410
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:32,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bolton Village is just another one of those steps.

1411
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:33,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me things haven't changed.

1412
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just stood before you all

1413
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:37,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and told you we have a $3 billion surplus.

1414
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Peter..Tell me things haven't changed.

1415
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:41,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No other mayor in the history of this city

1416
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:43,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}has been able to say that.

1417
01:22:43,410 --> 01:22:44,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me things haven't changed.

1418
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you step out of your house in the morning, with your children,

1419
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:50,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you take them to the parks, do you feel safe?

1420
01:22:50,290 --> 01:22:51,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, you do feel safe

1421
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:54,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I get your letters and I know you do.

1422
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:58,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's us, working together, getting it fixed.

1423
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:00,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me things haven't changed.

1424
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right, mayor.

1425
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:08,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Councilman Valliant, the original question still remains.

1426
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What would you have done to reverse the debt?

1427
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:15,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like..Don't worry about it. Nicky fixed it.

1428
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:31,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two honks for trouble. Got it.

1429
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Lean your seat back all the way, okay?-Okay.

1430
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be right back.

1431
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:02,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You know who I am?-No.

1432
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:07,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know who you are, Todd. You're a fucking piece of shit!

1433
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:08,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You set up Andrews to die.-No. No.

1434
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You set him up!

1435
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:12,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You arranged that meeting and lured him out.

1436
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No, I didn't.-You let him walk into an ambush.

1437
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:16,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I didn't kill him.-You want to play games with me?

1438
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut your fucking mouth! You're a fucking liar.

1439
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:20,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I didn't kill him.-Liar.

1440
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:23,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm not a liar.-You want to lie to me?

1441
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not lying.

1442
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:27,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He was my friend.-What?

1443
01:24:27,390 --> 01:24:29,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He was my friend!-Get up!

1444
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:31,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now!

1445
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:34,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me what the fuck is going on!

1446
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:37,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please stop hitting me!

1447
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:39,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know.

1448
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:42,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just there to give him something.

1449
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:45,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was down on the corner, waiting for him.

1450
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:49,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw him coming down the stairs and I waved, okay?

1451
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was gonna give him something to help Valliant win.

1452
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To help Valliant bring down that son of a bitch Hostetler!

1453
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:56,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That doesn't make any sense.

1454
01:24:56,630 --> 01:24:58,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hostetler's your father's friend.

1455
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:01,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck my father!

1456
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:03,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had the contract in my hand.

1457
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Paul, he saw me waving and he smiled.

1458
01:25:11,270 --> 01:25:14,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Murdock must have followed me in his car,

1459
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then he got out and he shot him, man.

1460
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He shot him in the fucking head.

1461
01:25:18,570 --> 01:25:20,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then he showed up to work the next day

1462
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like nothing happened.

1463
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:24,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Todd, it's all right. Look at me. Look at me.

1464
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calm down, okay?

1465
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:28,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's that contract?

1466
01:25:39,630 --> 01:25:40,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take it.

1467
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want it anymore.

1468
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:52,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure you're ready to do this to your father?

1469
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:54,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Ah.

1470
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

1471
01:25:56,770 --> 01:25:58,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get upstairs. Go.

1472
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was an accident.

1473
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Taggart. Just calm down.

1474
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:38,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Motherfucking fuck!

1475
01:27:20,230 --> 01:27:21,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?

1476
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:25,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1477
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?

1478
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:29,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm all right.

1479
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:09,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got those reporters' e-mail addresses?

1480
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep.

1481
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Billy, are you sure about this?

1482
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:17,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you don't hear from me in two hours, send that e-mail.

1483
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:19,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

1484
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:24,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for being there, Katy.

1485
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:27,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every time.

1486
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:43,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good evening. May I help you?

1487
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:46,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, tell the mayor it's Billy Taggart.

1488
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:48,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One moment, please.

1489
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr.Mayor.

1490
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:14,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Billy.

1491
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:18,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a nice surprise. Thank you, Valerie.

1492
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:22,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}VCR. I haven't used one in years.

1493
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:26,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Take your coat?-No, I'm good.

1494
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:29,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to say, Billy, you're looking worse for wear.

1495
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:32,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got into a bit of a thing.

1496
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:35,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm glad you made it out.

1497
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:39,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Drink?-Yeah, make it a double.

1498
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Attaboy, Billy.

1499
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

1500
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:51,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how did Fitzgerald say it?

1501
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:53,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"To the orgiastic future

1502
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:57,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that year by year recedes before us."

1503
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:58,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cheers.

1504
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:04,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even know what that means.

1505
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me neither.

1506
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What can I do for you, Billy?

1507
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:12,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna know why you hired me.

1508
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:15,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stick with the adultery narrative.

1509
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's sexier.

1510
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:18,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lies are always sexier.

1511
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:20,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've had enough this week to last a lifetime,

1512
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so why don't you just tell me the fucking truth?

1513
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:31,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The truth is I hired you to investigate my wife.

1514
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:33,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Investigate her for what?

1515
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:36,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For not minding her own business is for what.

1516
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For having a big mouth is for what.

1517
01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:42,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For asking too many questions is for what.

1518
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:44,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Better be careful following her example, Billy,

1519
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:47,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I might have to hire someone to investigate you.

1520
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who? Your boy Murdock?

1521
01:30:49,730 --> 01:30:54,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think he's available for the job.

1522
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:55,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope he didn't suffer.

1523
01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:57,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No more than Andrews did.

1524
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:59,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn shame what happened to that man.

1525
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:02,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So tell me, did you really think I'd let you turn me

1526
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:05,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}into an accessory to murder? For $50,000?

1527
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:08,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you think I wouldn't ask any questions?

1528
01:31:08,210 --> 01:31:10,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or that I wouldn't get any answers?

1529
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What answers have you got, Billy?

1530
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:14,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andrews was about to link you to Bolton Village.

1531
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:17,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the reason you got rid of him.

1532
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:20,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No, sir. Not me.-Oh, not you.

1533
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:22,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The man you hired. Murdock.

1534
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:24,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try getting that testimony.

1535
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:27,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. You're good, mayor. I give you that.

1536
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:29,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got it all worked out, huh?

1537
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:31,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The denial about Bolton Village.

1538
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The discount to Solstein Donagan.

1539
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:36,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The new big contract to the Rochway Group.

1540
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:39,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But nobody can do a damn thing about it, huh?

1541
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:41,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because anybody that could is either dead or bought.

1542
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:44,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm fucking impressed, mayor. You're good.

1543
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:48,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps that's why the people keep electing me, Billy.

1544
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:50,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I simply get the job done.

1545
01:31:50,830 --> 01:31:53,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So all this, it was all for the city?

1546
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything I do is for this great city.

1547
01:31:56,130 --> 01:31:59,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The city doesn't own 50 percent of Rochway Group, mayor.

1548
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:00,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do.

1549
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look what I got.

1550
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What you got in your hand?

1551
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:12,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your fucking jugular, mayor.

1552
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:19,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fifty percent of $4 billion is a lot of fucking money.

1553
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:21,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So here's how this works.

1554
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:24,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got an e-mail in my outbox with a copy of that contract.

1555
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:26,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I click one button,

1556
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a hundred newsmen will read your name

1557
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:30,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}alongside Sam Lancaster's in black and white.

1558
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, I got the original nice and safe.

1559
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:36,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You resign, you step down, I'll keep my mouth shut.

1560
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:38,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those e-mails will never see the light of day.

1561
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:41,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that Bolton Village deal is dead.

1562
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:43,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to tear down other projects as a civilian,

1563
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:46,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so be it, but Bolton Village stands,

1564
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:48,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're gonna walk away.

1565
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:50,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the deal, mayor. I suggest you take it.

1566
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:52,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Counter offer.

1567
01:32:52,190 --> 01:32:53,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No need.

1568
01:32:53,230 --> 01:32:55,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got nothing left for you to threaten.

1569
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:58,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want the originals, I want all the copies,

1570
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:02,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I want your case file by 9 a.m. tomorrow.

1571
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:04,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're done, motherfucker.

1572
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are done.

1573
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:08,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ever spend a goddamn minute

1574
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:11,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}thinking why I chose you, Taggart?

1575
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:14,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I did choose you.

1576
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:16,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I chose you.

1577
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:20,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I own you.

1578
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:24,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna have to excuse the quality of the videotape.

1579
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:26,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was shot on one of those camcorders

1580
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:31,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they used to sell you 40 bucks on Eighth Avenue.

1581
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:33,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I think you're about to see the bigger picture.

1582
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:38,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, yo! First off, let me say welcome.

1583
01:33:38,570 --> 01:33:39,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to Bolton Village.

1584
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:41,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck is this?

1585
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:44,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What's your name, fool?-They call me Alex.

1586
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:46,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck is this?

1587
01:33:48,370 --> 01:33:49,950

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a pocket full of cash

1591

01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:08,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drop the gun, Mikey! Drop the fucking gun!

1595
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:11,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drop the fucking gun!

1596
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:13,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chill, man, what the fuck? Mikey, we just wanna talk.

1598
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:29,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay, Mikey. We just wanna talk.

1599

1601
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:00,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's your memory now, Billy?

1602
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:07,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now there's something that your average citizen..

1603
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:12,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}..just wouldn't understand.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I do.

1605
01:35:15,870 --> 01:35:20,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, we take because we can.

1606
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We take because it feels good.

1607
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:30,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only difference between you and I

01:35:30,010 --> 01:35:33,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is that you've gone and done it on videotape.

1609
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:34,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like I was saying, I want the original,

1610

01:37:13,070 --> 01:37:15,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only difference between you and I

1616
01:37:15,410 --> 01:37:19,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is that you've gone and done it on videotape.

1617
01:37:19,410 --> 01:37:22,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like I was saying, I want the original,

1618

1621
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:38,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll ruin you if you do this. You know that, Billy.

1622
01:37:38,890 --> 01:37:40,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Use it.

1623
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:43,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no statute of limitations on murder.

1624
01:37:43,690 --> 01:37:45,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I go with this,

1625
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:46,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't cut it down to protect you.

1626
01:37:46,770 --> 01:37:48,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not asking you to.

1627
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:54,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure?

1628
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:58,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time to square the debt.

1629
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:06,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies and gentlemen,

1630

1631
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:09,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you, Sam, you like a debate.

1632
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:11,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you enjoy that one?

1633
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:12,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Masterful.

1634
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you very, very much.

1635
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:16,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Firstly, I'd like to thank you for coming.

1636
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:21,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a room full of my wife and I's very, very good friends,

1637

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so thank you.

1638
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A man much smarter than me once said

1639
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:27,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that politics is the art of the possible.

1640
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:29,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This afternoon,

1641
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:33,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jack Valliant was ordering stationery.

1642
01:38:33,110 --> 01:38:34,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tonight, he's looking for the number of the bus

1643
01:38:34,990 --> 01:38:36,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that hit him.

1644
01:38:36,490 --> 01:38:38,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He fought a good fight, but he was boxing shadows.

1645
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was like Roberto Duran out there.

1646
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:43,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"No mas, Nicky, no mas. Don't hit me no more."

1647
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He says it's urgent. I'll deal with this.

1648
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:48,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't go anywhere. I have a lot of people to thank.

1649
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yes?-It's me.

1650
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:53,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Billy, I didn't think you'd call me so soon.

1651
01:38:53,420 --> 01:38:55,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look out your window now, mayor.

1652
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:58,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your future. I think your ride's here, Nick.

1653
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:06,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nicholas Hostetler,

1654
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:10,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're under arrest for the murder of Paul Andrews.

1655
01:39:10,570 --> 01:39:12,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have the right to remain silent.

1656
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything you say can be used against you.

1657
01:39:14,690 --> 01:39:17,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything I say will be used against you, Carl.

1658
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:18,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have the right to an attorney.

1659
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:20,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you cannot afford one, one will be provided.

1660
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:22,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Attorneys?

1661
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:24,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll pull your dental records when I'm done with you.

1662
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:25,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you understand these rights?

1663
01:39:25,910 --> 01:39:28,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand you're suicidal.

1664
01:39:28,290 --> 01:39:31,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You may have forgotten how you got your job, I haven't.

1665
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you really think a jury of my peers

1666
01:39:33,460 --> 01:39:35,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in New York City will convict me?

1667
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:39,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just the handcuffs guy.

1668
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:44,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Don't wait up, dear.-Have I ever?

1669
01:39:49,310 --> 01:39:51,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess we both misjudged Billy.

1670
01:39:51,730 --> 01:39:54,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then again, you misjudged a lot of us.

1671
01:39:54,190 --> 01:39:55,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We thought Billy would roll over,

1672
01:39:55,530 --> 01:39:58,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that Andrews was sleeping with your wife.

1673
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:00,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You thought I wasn't.

1674
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:34,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}New Yorkers have been put through an ordeal

1675
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:36,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}these last few days,

1676
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:37,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}beginning with the murder of Paul Andrews,

1677
01:40:37,940 --> 01:40:39,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}your campaign manager,

1678
01:40:39,610 --> 01:40:42,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and culminating last night with the arrest of Hostetler

1679
01:40:42,110 --> 01:40:43,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in connection with that crime.

1680
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:45,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What would you say to New Yorkers

1681
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:47,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who, quite frankly, have lost faith

1682
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:49,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in their government?

1683
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:52,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, days like these can shake your faith..

1684
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Rachael.-Hey.

1685
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:55,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You staying out of trouble?-I'm trying.

1686
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I know it.

1687
01:41:00,090 --> 01:41:01,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever he's drinking.

1688
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:10,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomorrow's the big day, huh?

1689
01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:17,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like our guy's a lock.

1690
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:23,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To Jack Valliant.
