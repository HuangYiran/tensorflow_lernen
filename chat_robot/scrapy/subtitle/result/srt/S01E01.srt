1
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,000
几百万年前
Several Million years ago

2
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,400
南极洲：现代
Antartica : Present day

3
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,100
韦尔博士
Dr. Weir

4
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,100
彼得
Peter.

5
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,200
看见了没？没效果
You see? Nothing.

6
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,400
卡尔森，回来
Carson, get back here.

7
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,400
我是可以坐那个椅子上整整一天的，
但是什么也不会发生
I could sit in that chair all bloody day
long and nothing’ll happen.

8
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,200
- 纯粹浪费时间
- 劳驾，韦尔博士
- It’s a waste of time.
-Excuse me, Dr. Weir.

9
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,500
他连试都没试
He’s not even trying.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
这种科技只对特殊的基因有反应，
这基因可是是他发现的
He’s the one who discovered the gene
this technology responds to.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,900
没错啊，不过他说他要是没发现就好了
Yeah, well,
he said he wish he never had it.

12
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,100
真的吗？
Really?

13
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,500
我知道难以置信，你能相信吗？
I know, can you believe that?

14
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,900
我们什么时候都可以对你
进行第三次测试的，罗德尼
We could always test you a third time, Rodney.

15
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,200
哼，这还真好笑呢
That’s very funny.

16
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
我们总共只找到几个人...
We have only found a handful of people

17
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,400
身上具有符合这种古代科技要求的基因
who are genetically compatible with
the Ancient technology,

18
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,600
除了你自告奋勇想要与它产生互动外
and despite your heroic effortsto interface
ours with theirs…

19
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,900
我们还需要其他每个人
都来坐这椅子试试，包括贝克特博士
…we need every one of them to sit in this chair
including Dr. Beckett.

20
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,100
可我该怎么做？他怕这玩意儿
What am I supposed to do?
He’s afraid of the thing.

21
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,500
这台椅子控制着人类已知的最强武器
This chair controls the most powerful
weapons known to humankind,

22
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,000
我也怕这玩意儿
I’m afraid of the thing…

23
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,500
不过每次有人坐在它上面时
But every time someone sits in it

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,500
我们就对建造了这前哨基地的古人
多了解了一点
we learn something new about
the Ancients who built this outpost.

25
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,400
贝克特博士应该为他的基因优秀而自豪
Dr. Beckett should be proud
he’s genetically advanced…

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,100
谈不上优秀，这只是随机特性而已
Not more advanced.
It is a random characteristic.

27
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,400
你好像对此很不以为然啊
我是说这套基因的说法
This really bothers you,
this whole gene thing.

28
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,000
哦，看来我是被嫉妒冲昏头脑罗
Oh, clearly I am overcome with envy.

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
啊，正好碰见我要找的人了
Ah, just the people I need to see.

30
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,100
跟我来
Come with me.

31
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,700
本来失踪城市的位置正一点点被我们定位
We’ve gotten closer, and closer,
to finding the location of the lost city

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,200
但是最后看来好像我们彻底找错地方了
but it turns out we’ve been looking
in the wrong place all along.

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,600
我们本来以为我们找到一个星门的地址
Now, we thought we had a stargate address.

34
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,600
六个符号代表了空间坐标
Six symbols representing coordinates in space

35
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,500
由此可以得知古人离开南极洲后，
前往的星球所在位置
that determine the location of the planet
the Ancients went to after they left Antarctica.

36
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,800
但是，最近，我们发现了第七个符号
Now, recently, we determined a seventh symbol.

37
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,900
表示出发地，地球？
The point of origin, Earth.

38
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,700
不是的
That’s not it.

39
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,300
那你的地址就一定是错误的
Then your address must be incorrect.

40
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,600
不是错误，而是不完整
Not incorrect, incomplete.

41
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,300
你什么意思，杰克森博士？
What are you saying, Dr. Jackson?

42
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,800
这是个八个符号的地址
It’s an 8 symbol address.

43
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,800
我们在寻找的可能超出了我们的想像
What we’re looking for may be further
away than we ever imagined,

44
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,200
但是还不算偏的离谱
but its not out of reach.

45
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,600
亚特兰蒂斯？
Atlantis.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,900
就是亚特兰蒂斯，我想我们可以去那了
Atlantis. I think we can go there.

47
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,100
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
Episode 1 & 2 Rising
by Team24 & SG-66
Forom.com & seriestele.net

48
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,800
阿帕奇，黑鹰，眼镜蛇，鱼鹰
（都是直升机型号）
Apache, Black Hawk, Cobra, Osprey.

49
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,300
为了南极洲你可是做了不少训练啊
That’s a lot of training for the Antarctic.

50
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,700
这可是我没有去过的大陆啊
It was the one continent I never set foot on.

51
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,300
这是我最不喜欢的大陆之一
It’s one of my least favorite continents.

52
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,100
我有点喜欢这里
I kinda like it here.

53
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,400
你喜欢这里？
You like it here?

54
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,500
是的，长官，十分钟后抵达
Yes sir.
Be there in about 10 minutes sir.

55
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,900
听我说，我们都玩过这套把戏了
我不是你要的人
Look, we’ve been through this.
I’m not your man.

56
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,800
别停
Keep moving.

57
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,600
我是博士，医学博士
I’m a doctor. A medical doctor.

58
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,000
没什么好怕的
There’s nothing to be afraid of –

59
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,700
你不明白，我会毁掉这玩意儿的
You don’t understand, I break things like this –

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
这东西都过了几百万年还丝毫无损，
它也一定能过你这关的
This device has survived for millions of years intact
-it will survive you-

61
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,400
现在，坐下，闭上眼睛，集中精神
Now sit down, close your eyes and concentrate.

62
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,700
还是一样，没效果
Again, nothing.

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,500
这次，试试在脑中建立一幅图像，
想像我们在太阳系中的位置
This time just try to imagine an
image of where we are in the solar system.

64
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,700
我觉得我感觉到什么东西了
I think I feel something.

65
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,800
可能和午饭有关
It could be lunch related.

66
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,800
闭嘴，集中精神
Shut up, and concentrate --

67
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,200
我做了什么？
What did I do?!

68
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,300
快把我们送回下面去！
Get us back down there!

69
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,800
所有靠近的飞机请注意，我们发现一枚
可以自行搜索目标的飞行器
All inbound aircraft, we have a rouge drone
that can seek a target on it’s own.

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,400
立即着陆，关闭引擎
我重复一遍，这不是演习
Land immediately and shut down your engines,
this is not a drill! I repeat…

71
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,900
太晚了，小心
It’s too late. Hang on.

72
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,000
右急转
Break right.

73
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,700
我说的是右
I said right.

74
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,000
我听到了，长官
I’m getting to that, Sir.

75
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,600
我告诉你了，我不是你要的人
I told you I was the wrong person –

76
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,100
现在这不重要了，赶快做点什么
It doesn’t matter now, just do something.

77
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
比如呢？
Like what?

78
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,900
卡尔森，在那武器还没伤人之前，
赶快集中精神，让它停下来
Carson, concentrate on shutting that
weapon down before it hurts someone.

79
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,800
我看不见那东西
I can’t see it.

80
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,300
拉起！拉起！
Pull up, pull up!

81
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,200
现在怎么样？
What about now?

82
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,400
现在这样就很好
Now’s good.

83
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,900
关掉它
Shut it down.

84
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,300
长官，那鬼东西到底是什么？
Sir, what the hell was that?

85
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,600
等等看
Wait for it –

86
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,300
快出去！
Get out!

87
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,700
我想我办到了
I think I did it.

88
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,000
那是不一样的
That was different.

89
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,800
对我来说差不多
For me, not so much.

90
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,600
谢帕德少校报告说，
那飞行器似乎已经停止运转了
Major Sheppard is reporting the drone
appears to have been incapacitated.

91
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,600
奥尼尔将军的直升机丝毫无损
并且重新起飞了
General O’Neill’s helicopter is unharmed
and on it’s way again –

92
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,800
还有七分钟
Seven minutes out.

93
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,500
谢天谢地
Thank god.

94
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,100
天啊
Holy Crap.

95
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,000
杰克！
Jack!

96
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,800
丹尼尔！
Daniel

97
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,700
热烈欢迎
Warm welcome.

98
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,400
不是我的错，你是怎么...？
Wasn’t me. How’d you manage to, uh –?

99
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,400
怎么逃过一劫，
没在半空中被打个稀巴烂的？
Keep my ass from getting blown out of the sky?

100
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,800
那都得归功于约翰·谢帕德少校
的出色飞行，他喜欢这里
The exceptional flying of Major John Sheppard.
He likes it here.

101
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,200
出色？你喜欢这里？
Exceptional – You like it here?

102
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,300
我们少废话，直入主题如何？
What say we cut to the part
where you start talking real fast?

103
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,600
啊，韦尔在这里
Ah, Weir’s in here.

104
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,000
嘿！什么也别碰
Hey! Don’t touch anything.

105
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,300
遵命，长官
Yes sir.

106
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,100
我们查出大概500万到1000万年前
古人把他们带着他们整个城市去了某处
I figure the Ancients packed up their entire city and left
somewhere between five and ten million years ago.

107
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,200
你是说他们的城市会飞
In their… flying city?

108
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,000
是的
Yes.

109
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,700
怎么了？
What?

110
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,400
会飞的城市？
Flying city?

111
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,500
呃，要知道他们可是
建造了星际之门的种族
Well, uh, keep in mind this is the race
that built the stargates

112
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,900
他们最喜欢兴师动众
–They did everything big.

113
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,700
那，他们为什么要离开？
So, why’d they leave?

114
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,000
为什么离开？呃，这谁知道呢？
Why’d they leave?
Um… Who knows?

115
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,700
我们知道在地球上，
古人们陷入了一场瘟疫
We know the Ancients on Earth were
suffering from a plague.

116
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,100
也许他们中间有人希望重头来过，
在一个新星系里面繁衍下去
Maybe some of them were trying to start over-
seeding life in a new galaxy.

117
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,100
可能古人们就是那么想的，
但关键是我们知道他们去哪里了
Maybe that’s what Ancients do…
The point is we know where they went.

118
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
飞马座
Pegasus.

119
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,000
是的，那是本星系群中
的一个矮星系的名字
Yes, it’s the name of a dwarf galaxy in a local group.

120
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,000
经过这么长时间了，
我们还有希望见到他们吗？
After all the time is there any hope
of actually meeting them?

121
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,400
这谁知道？
不过这原因还不够我们去一趟的吗？
Who knows?
But isn’t that reason enough to go?

122
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,200
我已经花了几个月
为这次探险挑选队员了，博士
Well I’ve been choosing members
for this expedition for months, Dr.

123
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,100
需要被说服的不是我
I’m not the one who needs convincing.

124
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,400
哦，我已经被说服了，祝你们开心
Oh I’m convinced.
Have fun.

125
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,400
呃，事情不是那么简单
Uh, it’s a little more complicated than that.

126
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,200
我们需要Zed-P-M来给星门补充能量
We need the Zed-P-M to power the gate.

127
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,400
什么？
What?

128
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,500
就是Z.P.M.，他是，呃，加拿大人
The Z.P.M. He’s, uh, he’s Canadian.

129
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,100
对不起，我没懂
I’m sorry.

130
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,000
哦，就是零点模块，将军
Oh, the Zero Point Module, General.

131
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,800
你在烈火焚烧之星发现的古代能源
The ancien power source you recovered
from Praclarush Taonas,

132
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,400
而现在那正给前哨基地提供防御能源
and that’s now powering the outposts’ defenses.

133
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,000
从那以后，我断定它产生的巨大能量...
I have since determined that it generates
it’s enormous power

134
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,400
来自于一个独立的次空间时间区
产生的真空能量
from vacuum energy derived from
a self-contained region of subspace time.

135
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,600
解释的不错，可惜没用
That was a waste of a perfectly good explanation.

136
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,300
我的回答是不行
The answer’s no.

137
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,500
他们真幸运，我不知道那东西从哪来
我就是集中了精神
…They’re lucky, I don’t know where it came from.
I just had to concentrate and

138
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,100
然后那飞行器就自己停止了
the drone shut itself down.

139
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,700
这么说是你干的
So you were the one.

140
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,600
我？
Me?

141
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,700
是你发射那东西打我的
You’re the one who fired that thing at me.

142
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:52,200
听我说，我们在作研究
这科技比我们先进不知多少光年
Look, we’re doing research, working with
technology that’s light years beyond us,

143
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,500
然后我们犯了个错误
我非常非常的抱歉
and we make mistakes.
I’m incredibly, incredibly sorry.

144
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,400
好啦，下次小心点好吗？
Well next time just be a little more careful, okay?

145
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
我刚才就是这么说的
That’s what I said-

146
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,100
那东西到底是什么啊？
What the hell was that thing anyway?

147
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,800
你说那飞行器？那是古人们造出来
保卫这个前哨基地的武器
You mean the drone? The weapon
the Ancients built to defend this outpost.

148
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,700
谁？
The who?

149
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,500
你有进入这里的安全许可对吧？
You do have security clearance to be here?

150
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,900
是的，是的，奥尼尔将军
刚刚把那东西给我
Yeah, yeah, General O’Neill just gave it to me.

151
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,700
而你居然不知道星际之门？
Then you don’t even know about the stargate.

152
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,100
什么？
The what?

153
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,100
杰克，你知道打开通向
另一个星系的星门要消耗大量能源
Jack, you know that gating to another galaxy
requires an enormous amount of power.

154
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,100
是的，我知道，换条路走
Yes, I do. Find another way.

155
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
没有其他的路了
There’s no other way.

156
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,700
你觉得亚特兰蒂斯上面会有
更多这种Z什么东西吗？
You think there are more of these Zed-things in Atlantis?

157
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,900
是的，而且谁知道我们还能找到什么呢
Yes, and who knows what else we could find.

158
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,400
我们谈论的可不仅仅是另外一个文明，
是星门的建造者
This isn’t just some other civilization we’re
talking about, these are the gate builders.

159
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,500
潜在的知识和科技财富...
The potential wealth of knowledge and technology,

160
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,000
比自从我们进入星门以来
遇见的任何东西都要重要
it outweighs anything we’ve come across
since we stepped through the stargate.

161
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,400
但是，鉴于进行这次旅行所需的能量
数量之大，很可能你们无法返回
Well, with the amount of power you’ll need
to make this trek, odds are it’ll be one way.

162
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,400
是的我们知道
Yes we know

163
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,800
但是对于人类的利益
将远大于风险，将军
But the benefit to humanity is
far greater than the risk, General.

164
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,700
而且我的探险队员中，
每个人都愿意承担这一风险
And it is a risk that every one of
my expedition members is willing to take.

165
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,700
他们认为基因在这里被用作
某种类似密码的东西，
They think the gene was used as a sort
of genetic key if you will, so that only

166
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,300
以保证只有他们的种族才能操控
这一危险而又强大的科技制品
their kind could operate certain
dangerous or powerful technologies.

167
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,000
就是说有些人和古人有相同的基因了
So some people have the same
genes as these Ancients.

168
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,100
这种特别的基因非常罕见，
不过总体来说他们和我们很相像
The specific gene is very rare, but on
the whole they look very much like we do.

169
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,100
事实上，他们是第一批进化成这种
类型的，而我们是第二批
In fact, they were first.
We’re the second evolution of this form.

170
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,900
古人们早在数百万年前就探索了整个银河
The Ancients having explored
this galaxy for millions of years before

171
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,200
少校，请不要
-Major, please don’t-

172
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,500
别这样，我和那些家伙
有相同基因的概率能有多少？
Come on, what are the odds of me having
the same gene as these guys?

173
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,500
事实上，微乎其微
Quite slim, actually.

174
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,500
韦尔博士！你别动！
Dr. Weir!
Don’t move!

175
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,300
这位是谁？
Who is this?

176
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,500
我说过不要碰任何东西
I said don’t touch anything.

177
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,000
我只是坐下而已啊
I just sat down.

178
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,400
少校，想像一下我们在太阳系所处的位置
Major, think about where we are in the solar system.

179
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,700
这是我办到的？
Did I do that?

180
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,200
我们会出发去探寻一个全新的古代文明
We could be on our way to discovering
an entirely new Ancient civilization.

181
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,700
最好的情况下，我们会碰见真正的古人
而且他们还愿意帮助我们
Best case scenario, we meet actual
Ancients who are willing to help us.

182
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,600
但是如果不是这样，将军，我们需要他
But if we don’t, General we need him.

183
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
对不起，博士，我需要丹尼尔留在这里
Sorry, Doc. I need Daniel here.

184
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,900
我说的是谢帕德少校
I’m talking about Major Sheppard.

185
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,900
哦，你不是已经有了一堆人
都可以使用这个古代科技制品了吗？
Oh, don’t you have a dozen or so people already
who can use the Ancient technology?

186
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,700
是的，如果集中精神，受过训练
他们能让它工作
Yeah, with concentration and training
they can make it work.

187
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,900
而约翰·谢帕德，他似乎天生就能做到
But John Sheppard, he does it naturally.

188
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,400
你知道，我查过他的记录
You know, I’ve checked into his record-

189
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,800
我知道他在阿富汗执行任务时
所谓污点的始末
I know about the whole supposed
black mark in Afghanistan,

190
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
他那是为了救三个军人的性命
he was trying to save
the lives of three servicemen.

191
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,300
那可是在执行任务时
拒绝服从直接的命令
Disobeying a direct order in the process.

192
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,100
我也读过您的档案，将军，求你了
I have read your own file, General. Please.

193
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,700
这样啊
Right.

194
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,100
好吧，这是你组织的探险
你要是想要他的话，就直接问他吧
Okay, it’s your expedition.
You want him, you ask him.

195
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,000
我问过了
That’s the thing, I have.

196
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,700
真的？
Really?

197
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,100
回程的路不长，所以我长话短说
This isn’t a long trip so
I’ll be as succinct as possible.

198
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,700
呃，这的确够短的
Well, that’s pretty succinct.

199
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,500
谢谢你
Thank you.

200
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,400
我告诉韦尔博士了，
我说我会考虑
I told Dr. Weir, you know,
that I’d think about it.

201
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,400
然后？所以？那么？到底怎样？
And? So? Well? What?

202
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,900
不是有意冒犯，长官，
但是我们才被一个外星导弹攻击完
With all due respect, Sir,
we were just attacked by an alien missile.

203
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,700
然后我就发现我自己有特殊的变种基因
Then I found out I have some mutant gene.

204
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,700
然后就冒出来这个星门，
还有什么去其他星系的探险
Then there’s this stargate thing and
these expeditions to other galaxies.

205
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,100
你知道吗，这不仅仅是你的事情，
谢帕德，不仅如此
You know, this isn’t about you Sheppard.
It’s a lot bigger than that.

206
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,600
现在，此时此刻，参不参加
这个行动似乎就是我的事
Right now, at this very second, whether I decide
to go on this mission or not seems to be about me

207
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,900
那我问你个问题
Let me ask you something.

208
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,900
你干嘛要做个飞行员？
Why’d you become a pilot?

209
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,300
我认为不想飞的人都是疯子
I think people that don’t wanna fly are crazy.

210
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,800
而我认为不想通过星门的人
也一样是失败者
And I think people who don’t wanna go thru
the stargate are equally as whacked.

211
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,100
如果等我们抵达迈克墨多克的时候，
你还是不能答应的话，我都不想要你了
Now if you can’t give me a ‘yes’ by the time
we reach McMurdoch, I don’t even want you.

212
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,100
西蒙，如果你在看这段录像
Simon, if you’re watching this,

213
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,100
这意味着总统心地善良，
给予你安全许可了
it means that the President has been kind
enough to grant you security clearance.

214
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,800
我不是去另外一个国家，执行外交任务
I’m not going on a diplomatic mission
to another country.

215
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,600
我是通过一个叫做星门的仪器，
去另外一个星系的另外一个星球
I’m going to another planet, in another galaxy,
by means of a device called a stargate.

216
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,300
数百万年前，曾经有一种生物，
我们称其为古人
Millions of years ago there was a race
of beings we call the Ancients…

217
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,100
他们用这种星门在我们的银河系内
建立了一套网络
…They created a network of these stargate
 throughout our galaxy,

218
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,600
以便他们可以自由穿行于各个星球之间
in order to travel freely among their worlds…

219
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,400
我们不知道原因，但是大概500万到
1000万年前，他们离开，去了另外一个星系
…We don’t know why, but the left for another galaxy
somewhere between 5 and 10 million years ago…

220
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,300
走的时候，他们带走了他们整个城市
那座城市就叫做亚特兰蒂斯
…taking their entire city along with them.
That city was called Atlantis.

221
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,000
我一直在组建一支探险队
I have been assembling an expedition team…

222
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,100
试图找到亚特兰蒂斯，并且期望能
找到那很久以前就离开的古人们
…in order to try to find Atlantis, and hopefully
the Ancients that left Earth all those years ago…

223
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,700
我想要做这个，西蒙，全心全意的想
I wanna do this, Simon, with all my heart.

224
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,200
你对我很了解，你知道
我是不可能放弃这种机会的
You know me well enough to know
I could never turn down an opportunity like this,

225
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,400
但是我希望有机会告诉你...
but I wanted the chance to tell you…

226
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,300
“您拨打的用户现在不在服务区内”
"the cell of the customer you're trying to reach
is curently outside the covered area"

227
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,100
好吧
Ok.

228
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,600
我是说我已经把可能性缩小到
三个东西上了，但是过了一个星期，我...
I mean I narrowed it down to about
3 things, but after a week, I ...

229
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,100
我没有...有谁会说这些人说的语言吗？
I don't under ... Does anyone else here speak
the language these guy's are speaking?

230
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,400
我只需要几分钟完成我的工作
而你站在这里毫无帮助
I just need a couple of minutes to finish my work,
and you're not helping by standing there.

231
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,700
如果你5分钟内还不能让它动起来
我就不要了
You’ve got 5 minutes to get it going
or I’m leaving it.

232
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,900
这里的每件设备都被双重甚至三重检查
过了，起飞准备已经做好，别再查了
Everything in here has been double checked and
triple checked and cleared for takeoff, leave it alone.

233
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,800
听我说，上校，我不对你负责
Look, Colonel, I don’t answer to you.

234
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,400
他对我说了同样的话，长官
He said the same to me, Sir.

235
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,300
那你的手枪是干什么的？
That’s what your sidearm is for.

236
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,100
你看，每个符号代表的地址都
告诉我们的星门...
You see, each chevron address is
what tells our gate

237
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,500
在我们星系外面寻找的一个点
因此直到他定位之前，我们都不知道在哪
to look for a point in space outside our galaxy,
so we won’t know until it locks.

238
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,900
我们做好准备了？
We there yet?

239
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,500
我们只差迈凯博士了
We’re just waiting on Dr. McKay.

240
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,400
现在应该可以工作了
It should work now.

241
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,500
好的，中士，试试看
Okay Sgt., give it a try.

242
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,700
当ZPM察觉到它连接上星门以后，
它就会变亮
The Zed-P-M should light up when
it senses a conductive connection to the gate.

243
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,300
请大家注意听我说好吗？
Can I have everyone’s attention please?

244
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,400
好啦，我们准备好了
All right, here we go.

245
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,400
我们准备尝试进行连接
We are about to try to make a connection.

246
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,500
我们无法预计这将消耗多少能量
We have been unable to predict exactly
how much power this is going to take

247
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,800
而我们可能只有一次机会
and we may only get the one chance at this.

248
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,900
所以如果我们可以建立一个稳定的虫洞
我们就不会冒险关闭星门
So if we are able to achieve a stable wormhole,
we’re not gonna risk shutting the gate down.

249
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,300
我们会派移动式机器人分析探测器过去
查看是否适合人类生存，然后就出发
We’ll send in the MALP robot probe,
check for viability, and go

250
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,400
所有的一切就只有一次机会
Everything in one shot.

251
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,100
你们每个人都是自愿参加这个任务的，
而你们代表了数十个国家
Now every one of you volunteered for this mission,
and you represent over a dozen countries.

252
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,200
你们是世界上最优秀和最聪明的人
You are the world’s best and brightest,

253
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,400
而就我们即将进行的探险来看，
and in light of the adventure we are
about to embark on,

254
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,400
你们也是最勇敢的
You are also the bravest.

255
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,600
我希望有天我们都能回来，而且发现了
一个有待人类探索的全新领域
I hope we all return one day having discovered
a whole new realm for humanity to explore,

256
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:49,500
但是如我们所知的，
我们可能永远无法回家了
but as all of know,
we may never be able to return home.

257
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,100
因此我给你们一个最后机会
放弃参与这项行动
I’d like to offer you all one last chance
to withdrawal your participation.

258
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,700
开始拨号程序
Begin the dialing sequence.

259
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,600
我把话说清楚，少校
你来此不是出于我的选择
Let me make myself clear, Major.
You are not here by my choice.

260
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,100
我肯定当你了解我以后，
你会喜欢我的，长官
I’m sure you’ll warm up to me once
you get to know me, Sir.

261
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,000
只要你能记住是谁在发号施令
As long as you remember who’s giving the orders.

262
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,700
是韦尔博士，对吧？
That would be Dr. Weir, right?

263
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
第三符号编码完成
Chevron three encoded.

264
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,900
第四符号编码完成
Chevron four encoded.

265
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,100
很好
Nice.

266
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,100
谢谢
Thank you.

267
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,800
第五符号编码完成
Chevron five encoded.

268
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,900
第六符号编码完成
Chevron six encoded.

269
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,100
马上就要开始了
This is it.

270
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,800
说真的，博士，放松点，你让我很尴尬
Seriously, Dr., Calm down.
You’re embarrassing me.

271
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,400
我一生中从来没这么兴奋
I’ve never been so excited in my entire life.

272
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,400
第八符号锁定完成
Chevron eight is locked.

273
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
派出移动式无人分析探测器
Send the MALP.

274
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,700
我们收到探测器传回的信息了
We have MALP telemetry.

275
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,200
我们面对的是什么？
What is it we’re looking at?

276
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,900
转入零点锁定
Switching to zero locks.

277
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,900
雷达显示空间很大
The radar indicates a large room?

278
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,000
结构很完整
It’s structurally in tact?

279
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,300
大气分析仪显示那里有氧气
The climactic sensors say there’s oxygen,

280
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,600
没有明显的有毒物质
no measurable toxins;

281
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,700
适合人类生存
we have viable life support.

282
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,800
看来我们不需要放弃了
Looks like we’re not getting out of this.

283
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,700
韦尔博士，你可以出发了
Dr. Weir, you have a go.

284
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,100
谢谢你，长官
Thank you, Sir.

285
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,700
出发了，我们不知道还剩下多少能量
Let’s go people,
we don’t know how much power we’ve got.

286
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,700
警卫队1队，2队先出发
Security teams 1 and 2, you’re up first.

287
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,700
其余人等待我们的信号再跟上来
All other personnel will follow on our signal.

288
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,100
一旦到了那一面，就继续前进
Once on the other side, keep moving,

289
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,400
确保出发区域的安全，跟我来！
clear the debarkation area. On my lead…

290
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,200
等等，上校
Hold on, Colonel.

291
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,300
我们一起过去
We go through together.

292
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,100
够公平
Fair enough.

293
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,100
-杰克，我现在出发不算太晚......
- Jack, it’s not too late for me to-
- No.

294
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:24,100
我现在还来得及......
- I could just grab my-
- No.

295
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,300
一切正常
All clear, it looks good.

296
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
探险队，出发!
Expedition Team, move out.

297
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,800
穿过时感觉如何？
What does it feel like?

298
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,800
痛彻心肺，先生，哦嚯！
Hurts like hell, sir.

299
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:19,300
警卫队1队和警卫队2队检查当前区域
Teams one and two secure the immediate area.

300
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:46,300
其它人在有新命令之前
检查开放区域
Everyone else find an open space and park it until instructed otherwise.

301
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,400
那是谁弄亮的？
Who’s doing that?

302
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,400
警卫队，发现外星人了吗？
Security teams, any alien contact?

303
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,400
- 没有，长官
- 警卫四队这里没有，上校
Negative, Sir.
Team four negative, Colonel

304
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
灯会自己启动
The lights are coming on by themselves.

305
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,500
人到齐了
That’s everyone.

306
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,700
奥尼尔将军
General O’Neill,

307
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,700
-我从飞马星系亚特兰蒂斯基地发出的问候
Atlantis Base offers greetings from the Pegasus Galaxy.

308
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,800
-你可以切断星门的能量了
You may cut power to the gate.

309
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,200
这看起来像艘船 宇宙飞船


They look like ships. Spaceships!

310
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,200
我喜欢它
I love it.

311
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,000
韦尔博士，你一定要过来看看
Dr. Weir, you have to see this.

312
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
-我有很多东西要看，你们小心点
I have a lot of things to see.
Just be careful.

313
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,700
我什么都没碰
- I didn’t touch anything.
- Relax, Major.

314
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,100
放松点，少校，好像整个建筑感觉到
我们的到来，从冬眠中苏醒了一样
It’s like the entire complex is sensing
our presence and coming to life.

315
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,400
这里曾经是控制室
This has got to be the control room.

316
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,700
这很明显是他们的拨号回家装置
This is obviously their version of a DHD

317
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,200
哦，非常明显
Oh, obviously.

318
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,200
这可能是能量控制系统，可能是电脑接口
This area could be power control systems,
possibly a computer interface.

319
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,300
- 嗨嗨，你干嘛不搞清楚呢？
- 好的
- Hey, hey. Why don’t you find out.
- Right.

320
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,300
韦尔博士，我是萨姆勒上校，
你能下来到我这看看吗
Dr. Weir, Colonel Sumner.
Can you come down and meet me please?

321
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,700
我们在地下三层
We’re three levels down, come in.

322
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,700
马上过去
Right away.

323
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,100
我们只能搜索一部分，这地方太大了
We’ve only been able to secure a fraction
of the place, it’s huge.

324
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,600
这可能真的是消失的古城亚特兰蒂斯？
So it might really be the lost city of Atlantis?

325
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,900
我认为这个猜测不错
I’d say that’s a good bet.

326
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,900
哦，上帝！
Oh my god.

327
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,200
我们在水底下
We’re underwater.

328
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,700
我们在几百英尺的海洋下面
I’d say we’re under several hundred
feet of ocean.

329
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,200
如果我们无法拨号回去，这可能是个麻烦
If we can’t dial out,
this could be a problem.

330
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,000
上校，韦尔博士 我们在水底下


- Colonel, Dr. Weir.
- We’re underwater.

331
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,400
是的，我正想告诉你
Yes, I was just, uh, coming to tell you.

332
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:48,000
很幸运有一个力场挡住了 ...水…


Fortunately there’s some sort of force
shield holding back the water-

333
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
这太奇特了，不是吗？
Oh that is impressive, isn’t it?

334
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,600
贝克特博士发现了一样东西，
你该过来看看
Uh Dr. Beckett has found something
you should, uh, see.

335
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,300
希望能在飞马座繁殖新的生命
…In the hope of spreading new life in a galaxy

336
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,900
飞马座上原来是没有生物的
where there appeared to be none.

337
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:16,600
很快，新的生命开始生长和繁荣 这儿......


Soon, the new life grew and prospered, here…

338
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,700
- 这是全息图，录像会反复播放
- 我们在这里也建立了一套星际之门
- It’s a hologram, the recording loops;
- Here, as before, we built a system of Stargates,

339
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,600
我已经看了第二遍了
- this is my second time through.
-  so that fledgling civilizations

340
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,200
- 我们漏看了多少？
- 不多
- What have we missed?
- Not much.
- could travel between the stars,

341
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,900
交换知识和友谊
exchanging knowledge and friendship.

342
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,700
很快，上千个星球都结出了这种文明的果实
In time, a thousand worlds bore
the fruit of life in this form.

343
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,700
有一天我们踏入了暗黑世界，
那里沉睡着可怕的敌人
Then one day our people step foot on a dark
world where a terrible enemy slept.

344
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,400
我们从未遇到过比我们强大的生物
Never before had we encountered beings
with powers that rivaled our own.

345
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,600
我们太自负，因此没有好好准备 敌人以多袭少...


In our overconfidence we weren’t
prepared, and outnumbered.

346
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,200
...对没有防备的人类世界大开杀戒
The enemy fed upon the defenseless
human worlds like a great scourge,

347
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,200
最终只剩下亚特兰蒂斯城
until finally only Atlantis remained.

348
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,700
这个城市强大的防卫
足以抵挡他们的可怕武器
This city’s great shield was powerful enough
to withstand their terrible weapons,

349
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,000
但我们被攻击了很多年
but here we were besieged for many years.

350
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,700
为了拯救最后的幸存者
In an effort to save the last of our kind

351
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,700
这个伟大的城市被我们沉到了海底
we submerged our great city into the ocean.

352
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,600
亚特兰蒂斯星门是唯一
连接地球和飞马星系的通道
The Atlantis stargate was the one and only
link back to Earth from this galaxy,

353
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,900
最后的幸存者通过它回到我们曾经的家园
and those who remained used it to return
to that world that was once home.

354
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,900
在那里亚特兰蒂斯的幸存者们
过着他们的生活
There, the last survivors of Atlantis lived
out the remainder of their lives.

355
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,000
这个城市沉睡在海底
This city was left to slumber

356
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
期待有一天我们能够回来
in the hope that our kind would one day return.

357
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,000
亚特兰蒂斯的传说是真的
Huh. So the story of Atlantis is true.

358
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,700
被沉到海底的伟大城市
A great city that sank in the ocean.

359
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,300
只是没有发生在地球上
It just didn’t happen on earth.

360
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,200
也许古希腊人是从幸存的古人那里听到这个故事的
Well the ancient Greeks must have heard
it from one of the surviving Ancients.

361
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,600
我不喜欢听到他们饱受欺凌
I don’t like the fact that they
got their asses kicked.

362
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,500
让我们从头再看一遍
Let’s see it again from the beginning.

363
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,400
停下！关掉！
Stop! Turn it off.

364
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,500
整个城市的能量水平直线下降
Power levels throughout the city
are dropping like a stone.

365
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,400
什么意思？
What does that mean?

366
00:30:53,400 --> 00:31:00,600
如果不立刻停止所有的活动 我们就死定了


That if we don’t stop everything we’re
doing right now, we are dead.

367
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,000
告诉我这不是我的错
Please tell me this is not my fault.

368
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,100
不是 谢谢


- No.
- Thank you.

369
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,500
就我们现在所知的来看，
这个城市由3个零点模块提供能量
From what we’ve been able to ascertain the city
is powered by three Zero Point Modules.

370
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,000
2个已经耗尽了，还有一个
也快到了最大熵值了
Two are entirely depleted and
the third is reaching maximum entropy.

371
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,100
如果到了就用不了了，到时候将无法挽救
When it does, it’ll die too
and nothing can reverse that.

372
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,000
告诉我最坏的情况
Just tell me the bottom line.

373
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
抵挡海水的力场已经弱到了
能承受的最小水平了
The force field holding back the ocean has collapsed to its minimum sustainable levels.

374
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,600
但是看看，这儿，还有这
See here, and here,

375
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,300
力场已经抵挡不住，城市就进水了
where the shield has already failed
and the city is flooded.

376
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,700
可能是几年前发生的 这个部分可能因为星门的保护而没有被破坏


It could have happened years ago, this section is
probably more protected because of the stargate.

377
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,600
如果它彻底被破坏了怎么办？
What if it fails completely?

378
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,900
不用说如果，这只是时间早晚问题
It’s a matter of when, not if.

379
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:44,500
萨姆勒上校，你必须立刻命令
警卫队停止搜索这个城市
Colonel Sumner, to stop searching the city immediately.
you need to order your security team

380
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,400
所有警卫队员退回到大厅集合
All security teams fall back to the gate room.

381
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,000
情况不妙
It’s not gonna be good enough.

382
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,100
我们还有多少时间？
All right, well how much time do we have?

383
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,400
这很难说，几个小时，如果我们
减少能量消耗也许能维持几天
It’s hard to say. Hours, maybe days
if we minimize power expenditure.

384
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,100
我们自己的发动机呢？
What about our own power generators?

385
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,200
我们正在发动
We’re working on that, but with our most

386
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,900
即使我们用我们最先进的发动机 也会很快就会不够用


advanced naquada power generators,
the equations are coming up far short.

387
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,600
所以我们需要去寻找更多的ZPM
So we need to find more ZPMs.

388
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,800
如果不能搜索这个城市，我们怎么能找到呢？
Well how do we do that
if we can’t search the city?

389
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,900
如果有更多的ZPM，我们能够检测到
If there were more here,
 we’d be able to detect them.

390
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,300
我们能使用星际之门吗？
Can we use the stargate?

391
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,400
附近没有地方有足够的能量
去开一个虫洞返回地球
There’s nowhere near enough power
to open a wormhole back to earth.

392
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,100
也许去这个星系的某些地方可以
Maybe somewhere in this galaxy.

393
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,900
那会相对容易点
That’s relatively easy.

394
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,500
幸运的是，一些古代科技
还用那种老式按键系统
Fortunately, some Ancient technology still
uses good ‘ole fashion push buttons,

395
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
所以我们能够进入星门控制系统
so we’ve been able to access
the stargate control system

396
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,600
并且进入图书馆，得到数据库中
一系列已知的星门地址
and a library of known gate addresses
in the database.

397
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,700
这并不是全部 看看这个


That’s not all, look at this.

398
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,600
很像地球星门上的拱形
Just like the Iris on the earth gate.

399
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,300
还在用能量，还在用能量，还在用能量
Using power, using power, using power.

400
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,600
至少我们不需要与敌人战斗
At least we don’t have to deal
with any uninvited guests.

401
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,800
上校，召集一个警卫队
Colonel, assemble a team.

402
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,700
我们需要安全港，最好是另一个能量源
We need safe harbor, or better still,
another power source.

403
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,900
福特中尉，警卫队1队和2队
立刻集合，各就各位
Lt. Ford, gather security teams one
and two; everyone gear up.

404
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,100
我希望你也去
Major, I’d like you to go along.

405
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,900
好的，女士
Yes ma’am.

406
00:32:54,900 --> 00:33:01,700
现在，选择地点 开始拨号吧


All right, pick an address; start dialing.

407
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,800
第一编码完成
Chevron one encoded.

408
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,300
罗德尼
Rodney.

409
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:14,300
好的
Fine

410
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,200
机动分析研究室探测器准备前往侦察
Ready MALP 4 for off-world recon.

411
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,000
探测器显示可以存活
The MALP reads full viability

412
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,300
星际之门附近也没有动静
and no immediate signs of activity
around the stargate,

413
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,400
但会是漆黑一片
but its pitch black.

414
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:02,400
现在我们要使用身份鉴别系统
对任何靠近星门的人进行鉴识
For now, we’re going to use the tried and true system
of identification for inbound gate travelers.

415
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:11,300
我们出发吧！
Let’s move out.

416
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:13,100
求求你们，不要伤害我们！
Please, don't hurt us!

417
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,600
请不要，他们只是在玩耍！
Please, they’re just playing.

418
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,500
这没事吧，谢帕德？
Everything okay here, Sheppard?

419
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:30,000
没事，长官 只是几个孩子


Yes, Sir, just a couple of kids.

420
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,800
郝林
Halling.

421
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,700
我不知道那是什么意思
I don’t know what that means.

422
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,100
那是他的名字
It’s his name.

423
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,900
郝林，很高兴认识你
Oh, Halling.
It’s nice to meet you.

424
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,700
你们是来这做生意的吗？
Are you here to trade?

425
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:58,300
做生意？ 是的，我们是商人


Trade, yes. We’re… traders.

426
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,600
我告诉你多少次了，
晚上不要在森林里玩耍
Now how many times have I told you
not to play in the forest after dark?

427
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,600
真高兴你没出什么事
I’m just glad you’re safe.

428
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,200
泰勒希望见见你
Teyla will wish to meet with you.

429
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,500
过来吧
Come.

430
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,800
帕克，史密提，你们负责守卫星门
Parker, Smitty, you’re on gate duty.

431
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,000
通知亚特兰蒂斯基地，通知韦尔博士
Dial Atlantis base and let the good doctor know

432
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
我们正在和当地的居民进行接触
we’ve made contact with the indigenous people.

433
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,500
长官，你不介意我问你件事吧
Sir, if you don’t mind my asking,

434
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,000
我注意到你和谢帕德少校之间有矛盾
I’ve noticed you’ve got
a problem with Major Sheppard.

435
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,300
中尉，这主要与他的记录有关
My problem, Lieutenant, is with his record.

436
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:54,100
我不喜欢不服从上级命令的人
I don’t like anybody who doesn’t
follow the proper chain of command.

437
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,600
是的，长官
Yes, Sir.

438
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,900
那个戴的面具有什么用?
What was that mask you had on?

439
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,200
帮你在黑暗中看清东西，试试看
Helps you see in the dark, check it out.

440
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,300
喔呜，让我看看
Whoa. Let me see.

441
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,900
哇，能给我吗？
Whoa. Can I have it.

442
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,100
不行
No.

443
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,000
你这是什么面具？
 What’s the mask you got on?

444
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,100
这个？
This?

445
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,900
幻影族
The Wraith.

446
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,100
幻影族是什么人？
The Wraith. What’s that?

447
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,000
你不知道吗？ 你来自什么世界?
You don’t know? What world do you come from?

448
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
我能去那儿吗？
Can we go there?

449
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
恐怕不行
Afraid not,

450
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
我们从很远很远的星球来的
 I come from a galaxy far,
far away.

451
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,900
我是郝林
It’s Halling,

452
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,400
我带来了几个来自远方的人
I bring men from away.

453
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
进来吧
Enter.

454
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,100
他们想来做生意
These men wish to trade.

455
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:18,100
呃，很高兴认识你
It’s, uh, nice to meet you.

456
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,200
我是泰勒·伊玛根，特岗的女儿
I am Teyla Emmagan, daughter of Tegan.

457
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,700
马歇尔·萨姆勒上校
Colonel Marshall Sumner,

458
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,000
谢帕德少校
Major Sheppard,

459
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,900
福特中尉
Lieutenant Ford.

460
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,700
我们没有什么特别需要
We have very few specific needs.

461
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,200
我们不和陌生人做生意
- We do not trade with strangers.

462
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,400
是吗？
- Is that a fact?

463
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,200
我们只是想互相认识一下
Well then, we’ll just uh, we’ll have to get to know each other.

464
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,200
我，我喜欢法拉利赛车，大学橄榄球赛，
任何时速超过200英里的东西我都喜欢
Me, um, I like, uh, Farris Wheels, college football, anything that
 goes more than 200 miles per hour.

465
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,200
先生，这些话对他们没什么意义
Sir, that’s not gonna mean anything to them.

466
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,500
我只是随便说点什么打破僵局
Feel free to speak up,
I’m just trying to break the ice.

467
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,700
这些人帮不了我们，
最好不要跟他们浪费时间
These people can’t help us,
I’d rather not waste the time.

468
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,700
每天拂晓前，我们的族人都要喝一种粗茶
Each morning, before dawn,

469
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,500
为了迎接即将到来的一天
our people drink a stout tea to brace
us for the coming day.

470
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,500
你们和我们一起去吗？
Will you join us?

471
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,300
我很喜欢喝茶
I love a good cup of tea.

472
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,200
现在你对我的了解又更进了一步
Now there’s another thing you know about me.

473
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:19,200
我们可以说是朋友了
We’re practically friends already.

474
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,700
直到太阳升起，我们发现那个
We didn’t even know
it was there until the sun came up.

475
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,400
看起来他们要准备的东西还不少
Looks more promising than
anything else these folks have to offer.

476
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:55,400
很多防御所，很漂亮的小山谷 选址，选址，选址


Plenty of shelter, nice little valley…
location, location, location.

477
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,200
他们住的这个地方并不安全
The city of the Ancestors is not safe.

478
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,900
我们自己能解决
- We can handle ourselves.

479
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,500
幻影族就要来了
- The Wraith will come.

480
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:08,400
这些幻影族是什么人？
Who are these Wraith?

481
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,600
我们从来没碰到过不知道幻影族的人
We have never met anyone who did not know.

482
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,100
现在你终于碰到了
Well you have now.

483
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,800
如果幻影族没有入侵你们的家园，
你们应该回到那里
If the Wraith have never touched
your world you should go back there.

484
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,300
我们也想，但回不去
Oh we’d like to, but we can’t.

485
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:27,000
女士，看现在的情况是，我们遇到了点麻烦
See, here’s the thing, Ma’am,

486
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,700
我们需要一个安全的地方呆一会
we’ve got ourselves into a bit of a bind. We may need a safe place to stay for a while.

487
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:35,700
我们族人一直坚信如果我们回到自己
原来的城市，幻影族就会来攻击我们
Our people have long believed that the Wraith will come
 if we venture into the old city.

488
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,800
但这个想法我们一直没有证实
But, it is a belief
we have not tested in some time.

489
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,800
先生们
Gentlemen.

490
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,500
听着，我不在意他们说什么，
但这个城市值得看看
Look, I don’t care what they say,
that city’s worth a look.

491
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,500
更不用说这儿可能会有ZPM，
只是他们不知道或者不在乎
Not to mention the possibility there could be ZPMs there that they don’t know or care about.

492
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,700
幻影族如果是全息图上
那个女人提到的敌人怎么办？
What if the Wraith are the enemy
the Ancient hologram lady is talking about?

493
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:11,700
这些都表明我们应该离开亚特兰蒂斯，
去另一个能防御的地方
All the more reason for us to have a defensible
position should we need to abandon Atlantis.

494
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,000
呆在这，尽可能的找到更多信息
Stay here and find out what you can.

495
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,000
福特，你回到星门，把情况汇报给韦尔
Ford, you head back to the gate
and report in to Weir.

496
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
告诉她我们几小时后就会有结果
Tell her we’ll have answers for her in a few hours.

497
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,400
遵命，长官
Yes, Sir.

498
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,800
呃，我猜这只有你和我？还有他
Well, guess it’s just you and me … and him.

499
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:42,200
你们的头看着我，好像当我不存在一样
Your leader looks through me as if I were not there.

500
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,600
我呢？
Do I?

501
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,500
没有
- No.

502
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,700
你们真的回不了你的星球了？
You truly cannot return to your world?

503
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,000
真的
- No

504
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
那有些东西你需要看一下
Then there is something you should see.

505
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,400
那地方有多远？
How much further is this place?

506
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,400
不远
Not far.

507
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,300
罗德尼，告诉我一些好消息 没有


Tell me some good news, Rodney.
I can’t do that.

508
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,900
这个防御设备已经将海水
阻挡了好几个世纪了
The shield has held back the ocean for centuries.

509
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,200
也许它还能撑几年
And probably would have kept going for
years more,

510
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:29,500
但我们的到来改变了这一切
but our arrival changed that.

511
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,100
现在城市和海洋之间只剩下一薄层了
Now it’s nothing more but a thin
shell between the buildings and the water.

512
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,500
我们已经停止了搜索
- We stopped exploring-

513
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,500
但已经对它造成破坏
- The damage is already done.

514
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,000
大约1小时前这个城市
稍远点的那块已经被淹没了
Another section of the city on the far side
was flooded an hour or so ago.

515
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
即使我们光呆在这里，能量也在消逝
Even occupying this room is draining power.

516
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,200
只要萨姆勒上校报告说那边安全，
我们必须立即撤离
We need to evacuate the moment
Colonel Sumner reports back it’s safe.

517
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,200
你是说我们必须放弃这个城市？
You’re saying we have to abandon the city.

518
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,800
我们离开得越早，防御层才会撑得越久
The sooner we leave,
the longer that shield holds.

519
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,700
我小时候常在这玩
I used to play here as a child.

520
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:06,100
我觉得幻影族最后一次大袭击的时候 我们的幸存者就躲在这里


I believe this is where the survivors
hid from the Wraith during the last Great Attack.

521
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,300
让我来点
Let me get it.

522
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,300
我们很久以前就学会了使用火
We mastered fire long ago.

523
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:18,300
我猜是这样
Guess so.

524
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,800
这是什么？
What’s this?

525
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,900
几年前被我弄丢了
I lost this years ago.

526
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,100
你怎么...？
How did you-

527
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:53,100
它就在那儿放着
It was just lying right over there.

528
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,100
反射出光芒
It was reflecting off the light.

529
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,300
有人画了很多壁画？
Someone’s been busy, huh?

530
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,300
这个洞里的壁画非常多
The drawings in the caves are extensive.

531
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:20,300
一些壁画有上千年甚至更长的历史
Many must date back thousands of years, or more.

532
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,200
这个代表了你们城市的毁灭？
Does this represent the destruction of your city?

533
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,500
这幅壁画远远早于那个时候
This drawing far predates that.

534
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,500
难道有人能预知会发生什么事？
So, what?
Someone knew it was gonna happen?

535
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:37,500
我相信这已经发生过很多很多次
I believe it happens again, and again.

536
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,000
幻影族等我们繁衍到一定的数量
The Wraith allow our kind to grow in numbers.

537
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,600
当这个数到达到某个点
And when that number reaches a certain point

538
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,600
他们就会回来抓他们的人类奴隶
they return to cull their human herd.

539
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,600
有时候他们来需要几百年时间
Sometimes a few hundred years
will pass before they awaken again.

540
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,400
我们去过很多星球
We’ve visited many, many worlds.

541
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,600
但是没有哪个星球没被幻影族染指
I know of none untouched by the Wraith.

542
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,000
最后一次屠杀是在五个世代之前
The last great Holocaust was five generations ago.

543
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,300
他们还是回来了
Still they return,

544
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,800
这次人数更少以显示他们强大的力量
in smaller numbers,
to remind us of their power.

545
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,000
这是一种地狱般的生活
That’s a hell of a way to live.

546
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,700
我们不停的转移营帐
We move our hunting camps around.

547
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,700
我们尽力让孩子们不要生活在恐惧里
We try to teach our children
not to live in fear,

548
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,000
但这很难
but it is hard.

549
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,400
我们中的一些人能感觉到幻影族的袭击
Some of us can sense the Wraith coming.

550
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,600
那给了我们预警
That gives us warning.

551
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,200
我们该走了
We should go,

552
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,700
天快要黑了
it will be dark soon.

553
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,900
嗨，这白天很短
Man, days are short here.

554
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,700
谢帕德少校，我是萨姆勒上校，回话
Major Sheppard, this is Colonel Sumner. Come in.

555
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,200
上校，我是福特中尉，
谢帕德少校现在联系不上
Colonel Sheppard, this is Lt. Ford. Major Sheppard’s
out of radio range at the moment.

556
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,000
他到底在哪？
Where the hell is he?

557
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
我想泰勒想带他看些什么东西
I think Teyla wanted him to see something.

558
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,200
注意防卫
Defensive positions!

559
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,200
上校，星门附近有动静
Colonel, we have gate activity here.

560
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,800
上校，三架敌机朝你的方向飞过去了
Colonel, three bandits headed your way.

561
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:20,300
隐蔽！
Take cover!

562
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,400
怎么了？
- What is it?

563
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,400
幻影族
- The Wraith.

564
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,400
别管了，津透！
Just live it!
Jinto!

565
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:09,500
朝目标开火！
Fire at that target!

566
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,400
泰勒！
Teyla!

567
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,400
上校，他们在地面上包围了我们
Colonel they’re on the ground,
they’re all around us!

568
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:49,200
泰勒！
Teyla?

569
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,400
他们并不在那儿
They are not really there.

570
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,400
别相信你看到的，那是幻影族制造的假象
Do not trust your eyes. The Wraith
can make you see things that are not there.

571
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:08,500
我们必须快点
We must hurry.

572
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,400
上校，我是谢帕德，
你们看到的地面上的东西只是幻影
Colonel, this is Sheppard. What you see on the ground is just an illusion.

573
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,900
集中火力朝飞船开火
Concentrate and fire on the ships.

574
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:27,900
朝飞船开火！朝飞船开火！
Fire at the ships!
Fire at the ships!

575
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,900
贝慈，朝它射击！ 它们到处都是，长官


- Bates, snap out of it.
- They’re everywhere, Sir.

576
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:39,900
把它射下来！
Take that thing down.

577
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,500
泰勒，泰勒！
Teyla. Teyla!

578
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:59,500
长官，上校被抓走了
Sir, the Colonel. They’ve taken him.

579
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,600
星门再次打开 两架敌机正在靠近它


The gate’s coming on again.
Two enemy ships approaching.

580
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,400
让它飞走吧
Let ‘em go,

581
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,600
上面有我们的人
there are friendlies on board.

582
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,600
注意拨号装置，牢记编码！
Look at the dialing device;
burn those symbols into your mind.

583
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,200
×娘养的！
Son of a…

584
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,800
救命，救救我
Help! Help me!

585
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,200
我找不到我父亲了
I can’t find my father.

586
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,000
它在这
Here it comes.

587
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,100
我该看哪儿？
What am I looking for?

588
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:17,100
你看那儿，又有一部分防御层不起作用了
There… another part of the force field just failed.

589
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:22,100
我想我们时间不多了
I don’t think we have much time.

590
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,500
我们该怎么办？
How are we doing?

591
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,600
如果我能多一天时间
Look, if we can just buy ourselves another day,

592
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,900
也许我们可以.....
maybe we can-

593
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,700
这个城市牺牲了自己的部分区域，
为了保持主要部位的完整
The city is sacrificing parts of itself in order to maintain

594
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:37,600
但灾难性的损坏是不可避免的
these main areas, but catastrophic failure is inevitable.

595
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,600
我从来没有想到我能找到失踪的古人城市
亚特兰蒂斯完好无损
Not in my wildest dreams did I hope so completely untouched, so pristine…
to find the lost city of the Ancients

596
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,800
而我们除了离开没有别的方法？
and we have no choice but to walk away from this?

597
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,800
这是为了拯救它
- In order to save it.

598
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,300
为了谁去拯救它？
- To save it for whom?

599
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,200
我们没有足够的能量去发送信息
We don’t have enough power to send a message.

600
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,500
地球上的人会认为我们迷失了
As far as earth is concerned, we’re just
going to be missing; presumed lost.

601
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,600
我们会回去的，只要我们
在飞马星系上找到能源
We’ll be back. We’ll find
a power source somewhere in Pegasus.

602
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,200
我们还没有萨姆勒上校的消息，
不知道他那情况如何
We have yet to hear from Colonel Sumner,
we have no idea what’s out there.

603
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:04,200
不能再等了，我们必须离开，现在！
We can’t wait. It is time to go, now.

604
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,800
大家请注意，我是韦尔
Attention all personnel, this is Weir.

605
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,800
准备立即撤退
Stand by for immediate evacuation.

606
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:25,300
开始拨号
Dial the gate.

607
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:32,200
有一个虫洞进入这里
We’ve got an incoming wormhole.

608
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:39,900
我读到了福特中尉的身份验证码 让他进来


- I’m reading Lt. Ford’s identification code.
- Let him in.

609
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,600
进来吧，同志们，离拱门远点
Step in folks, move away from the puddle.

610
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,500
谢帕德少校
Major Sheppard!

611
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,700
谢帕德少校，这些人是谁？
Major Sheppard, who are all these people?

612
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,200
当地的幸存者，我们被袭击了
Survivors from the settlement;
we were attacked.

613
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,900
萨姆勒和我们的一些人被抓走了 发生什么事了？


Sumner and some of our men were taken.
What’s going on?

614
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,900
我们没有精力去管别人的事了
We are in no position to help anyone right now.

615
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,000
这到底怎么了？
What the hell’s going on here?

616
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,600
我们准备离开这里
We were about to abandon the city.

617
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:13,200
回去是一个很烂的主意 夏普勒少校,防御层抵挡不住了，海水会冲进来淹没我们


Major Sheppard the shield is about to fail and
the ocean is about to come crashing in on us.

618
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,700
你有更好的地方去吗？
Do you have a better place for us to go?

619
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,100
津透，我们可以通过星门去其它地方吗？
Jinto, you have any other address
where we can gate to?

620
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,500
有，很多
Yes, many.

621
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,900
他只是个孩子
He’s just a boy.

622
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:27,300
我是津透 她会很高兴认识你的


- I am Jinto.
- She’s pleased to meet you.

623
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:32,300
防御层崩溃了
The shield is collapsing!

624
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,000
我正在拨号
I’m dialing an address.

625
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,800
不，等等 她是正确的


- No wait!
- She’s right.

626
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
我们在移动
We’re moving!

627
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:16,900
我们好像在水面上
We’re on the surface.

628
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,100
我本来只希望见到明天
I was hoping for another day.

629
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:28,700
但看起来好像我们得到的不仅仅如此而已
It looks like we just got a whole lot more than that.

630
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:33,700
我们不要浪费这一机遇
Let’s not waste it.

631
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,000
伙伴们，听着
People listen up.

632
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,200
先不要休息，直到他们把两台设备搬离甲板 我们现在出发


No one gets to sit down until they carry two pieces of equipment
 off this deck. Now let’s go.

633
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,200
最后一个零点模块已经耗尽了
The last Zero Point Module is depleted,

634
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,300
虽然我们发动机的能量不能阻挡海水，
但有限的能量已经恢复了
but limited power has returned now that our
generators aren’t trying to hold back an ocean.

635
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,300
生命支持系统还在运行，
这个星球的空气可以呼吸
Life Support systems are working,
but the planet’s atmosphere is breathable,

636
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,200
不会引起过敏
not withstanding the inevitable allergens.

637
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,000
现在我们最先进的发动机
可以为防御层提供足够的能量吗？
So now could our naquada generators supply
enough power to the shield for defensive purposes?

638
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,100
远远不够 我们在海面上，又没有防御层，就是个靶子


- Not even close.
- On the surface without a shield; we’re target practice.

639
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,800
上校我已经完全意识到这一点，不过谢谢你的提醒
I’m acutely aware of that Major,
but thank you for reinforcing it.

640
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,000
你什么时候能告诉我幻影族
把萨姆勒上校和其他人抓哪去了？
When can you tell me where the Wraith
took Colonel Sumner and the others?

641
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,600
即使有了福特中尉提供的6个编码，
还是会有数百种组合
Even with the six symbols Lt. Ford provided, - there are still hundreds of permutations-

642
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,000
720个？
- 720.

643
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,600
是的，我当然知道。
Yes. I knew that of course…

644
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,500
我只是奇怪你怎么也会知道？
I’m just… surprised you do.

645
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,700
把无法锁定位置的坐标除去
Take away the coordinates you can’t get a lock on,

646
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:40,700
当你找到坐标，就发送一个机动分析探测器
and that’s you’re one.
And when you find it, send a MALP.

647
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:46,300
少校，过来一下
Major, a word.

648
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:18,300
让我来猜猜 你不愿意让我去拯救他们


Let me guess,
you’re not gonna let me rescue my people.

649
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,700
少校，你连他们是死是活都不知道
Major, you don’t even know if they’re alive.

650
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,300
但不管怎样不能让他们在敌人手上
You don’t leave people in the hands of the enemy.

651
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:29,200
而我们这次谈话这么避人耳目
And the fact that we are having this conversation in private

652
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,100
让我明白你知道这是不对的
lets me know that you know damn well that it’s wrong,

653
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,900
而且会大大有损你的领导力
and it will totally undermine your leadership.

654
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,400
所以作为一个有头衔的军官，我...
So as ranking military officer I-

655
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:40,100
好吧，先闭嘴！听我说一会，好吗？
All right, just shut up
and listen to me for a moment, all right?

656
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,600
喂，我们对幻影族了解有多少？
Come on, what do we know about the Wraith.

657
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:47,600
我们仅仅知道他们是摧毁古人的敌人
One of the few things that we do know is that they are the enemy that defeated the Ancients.

658
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,100
当我们刚开始使用在地球上发现的星门后
When we first began to use the stargate we found on earth

659
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,600
我们就有了大麻烦，为什么？
we got ourselves into serious trouble. Why?

660
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,192
我不需要回答你的问题
- I don’t need to answer your question-
- Because the people in charge

661
00:56:54,193 --> 00:56:56,900
 因为指挥者在行动时不考虑后果
didn’t consider the ramifications before they reacted.

662
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,100
他们带走了我们的人，你让我怎么行动？
They took our people.
How am I supposed to react?

663
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,400
我们无力抵抗，你也这么说
And we’re defenseless,
you said so yourself.

664
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,200
你有没有想过进行这种愚蠢的营救...
How do you know going off
on some half-assed rescue mission

665
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,100
可能会把他们引到我们家门口？
isn’t going to bring them
all right back here to our doorstep?

666
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:15,200
也许真的会 但这么做是正确的 为什么？因为就是这样


Maybe it will, but it’s the right thing to do.
Why? Because it is.

667
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,000
约翰 如果我们不这么做，我是说现在


- John-
- If we’re not gonna do this, and I mean right now,

668
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,700
我们就掉头，准备回去吧 因为他们要来了


let’s just turn tail and pack up.
Because they’re coming-

669
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,500
你怎么知道？
You don’t know that.

670
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,500
我们的人在敌人的手上
Our people are in the hands of the enemy, Doctor.

671
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,400
你知道这意味着什么吗？
Do you know what that means?

672
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,600
幻影族发现我们的基地只是时间问题
It’s just a matter of time before the Wraith
figure out that this is the base of our operations.

673
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,900
我只是需要更多的信息
I just need more information.

674
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:36,000
我是说谁会知道呢？ 也许我们可以协商出一个和平......


I mean who knows?
Maybe we could negotiate a peaceful-

675
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,100
和平解决？ 你开玩笑吧？


Peaceful? Are you kidding

676
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:41,400
在他们出现之前几个小时我们才到那
We weren’t there for more than
a few hours before they showed up.

677
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,400
他们会来有没有可能是因为你？
Is it possible they came because of you?

678
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,700
你把这些人带回来，可能会泄漏机密
And that one of these people you brought
back here with you tipped them off?

679
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,800
很有可能 所以你的这个决定没有经过深思


- It’s possible.
- See that is exactly the kind of snap decision I am referring to.

680
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:57,800
他们并不是坏人
They’re not all bad people.

681
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:03,100
你知道如果我们想呆在这儿，就需要朋友
And you know, if we’re
gonna stick around here we need friends.

682
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,600
好吧，我明白你的意思了
Okay, I see your point.

683
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:14,000
现在你也要明白我的立场
Now you see mine.

684
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,800
如果完全没有成功的希望，
我不会批准一次营救行动
I will not authorize a rescue mission unless I am sure there is at least a remote chance of success.

685
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:25,600
我不想让更多优秀的人去送死，包括你
I’m not sending more good people,
including you, to their deaths.

686
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:30,600
好的
Okay.

687
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,000
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

688
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,500
我们在哪？
Where are we?

689
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:52,300
你知道将会发生什么事吗？
Any idea what to expect?

690
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,900
不知道
No.

691
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,400
你的朋友说过，如果我们走进废墟，
幻影族就回来
Your friend was the one who said the Wraith would come if we went down into the ruins.

692
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,100
也许你应该留意他的警告
Perhaps you should have heeded his warning.

693
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:04,100
我怎么知道他说的对不对？
How do I know he’s not the one who told them?

694
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:10,600
有人来了
Someone comes.

695
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:28,800
我是马歇尔·萨姆勒上校
I’m Colonel Marshall Sumner-

696
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:44,800
不，留下他
No. Please.

697
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,100
把我带走吧
- Take me in his place.

698
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:48,800
别，还是带我吧
- No, take me.

699
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,100
我们就是你要找的人，对吗？
We’re the ones you’re after, right?

700
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:58,100
我是他们的头
I’m their leader.

701
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,000
他们没有必要向你解释
They have no need to explain themselves.

702
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,900
是的，我明白了
Yeah, I got that.

703
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,000
我们正在接受可视遥测数据
We’re receiving visual telemetry.

704
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,400
我什么也没有看到
We can’t see anything.

705
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,100
没有大气分析数据
No atmospheric readings at all.

706
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,700
等一下，那是什么？
Wait, what was that?

707
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:28,700
转动摄像机
Rotate the camera.

708
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,200
哦，机动分析探测器已经发射了
Well… there goes that MALP.

709
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,700
在太空里
It’s in space.

710
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:38,300
这是在一个飞马星系另一侧的
一颗星球的高轨道上
It’s in high orbit around a planet
on the far side of the galaxy.

711
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,100
你肯定定位没错？
You’re sure this is the right address?

712
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:44,300
这是我们唯一能锁定的目标
It’s the only one we could get a lock on.

713
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,800
好吧
Very well.

714
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,400
关掉它
Shut it down.

715
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:52,400
对不起
I’m sorry.

716
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:57,800
跟我来，少校
Come with me, Major.

717
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:30,200
觉得你能驾驶它吗？
Think you can fly it?

718
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:35,200
我们来试试看，怎么样？
What do you say we find out?

719
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:52,100
贝克特博士，你想给我看什么？
Dr. Beckett,
what was it you wanted me to see?

720
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:03,900
这些细胞里没有正常的人类抑制蛋白质
These cells have none of the normal
human inhibiting proteins whatsoever.

721
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,800
这给了他们难以置信的繁殖能力
That gives them an incredible ability to regenerate.

722
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,900
谢帕德少校看到的移动是怎么回事？
What about the movement Major Sheppard saw?

723
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,700
就那种行为而言
As far as independent behavior,

724
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:18,700
我认为他看到的移动，是由他们被切断的
神经末梢上多余的命令语言造成的
I say that anything he saw was caused by a residual command language
 in the severed nerve endings.

725
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:23,600
好吧，还有呢？
All right, anything else?

726
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,000
我敢打赌
The being this arm belonged to,

727
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,400
拥有这只胳膊的生物
if I was a betting man,

728
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,300
他们的历史很悠久
I’d say it was old.

729
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:30,900
非常非常悠久
Very, very old.

730
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,100
多久？
How old?

731
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,800
只要这些细胞能获得合适的养分
As long as the cells are properly nourished,

732
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:40,600
这种生物不会像地球人那样，
因为年龄增长而自然死亡
I don’t see a life form like this ever
dying of natural aging the way we do.

733
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:43,100
而且要杀死他们很困难
And they’d be bloody hard to kill.

734
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:45,500
真是个坏消息
Well I don’t like the sound of that.

735
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:50,500
我不想诅咒
I don’t blame ya.

736
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:55,300
什么声音？ 我，我不知道


- What is that noise?
- I... I don’t…

737
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,200
刚刚他还在这儿
he was right here.

738
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,600
少校？
 Major!

739
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,800
你说过你想拥有战术优势
You said you wanted tactical advantage.

740
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,200
是的
All right,

741
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,700
你能驾驶那玩意儿
so you can fly that thing.

742
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,800
这并不意味着你能拯救他们
It doesn’t mean you can pull off a rescue.

743
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:15,800
博士，这是你把我带到这来的意义
Doctor, this is why you brought me here.

744
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,300
准备好了吗？
Ready?

745
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,000
我不知道
I have no idea.

746
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,800
这些技术比我们先进太多了
This technology is so far beyond us.

747
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:30,300
我不知道该怎么操作，我只能...
We don’t have a clue what we’re dealing
with. For all I know we could…

748
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:32,900
是的，我准备好了
Yeah, I’m ready.

749
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:37,900
好了，朋友，准备出发
All right boys, get ready to go.

750
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,700
星门飞船一号，出发吧！
Gate Ship One, ready to go.

751
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,900
星门飞船一号？
Gate Ship One?

752
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,600
就像这样的小汽艇吗？
A little puddle jumper like this?

753
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,800
这是会穿越星门的飞船
It’s a ship, it goes through the gate.

754
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,200
星门飞船一号 哦，不，不，这名字不好


- Gate Ship One.
- Oh no, no, no. That’s all wrong.

755
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,900
迈凯博士认为这名字很酷 哦，好吧，这算官方名字


- Dr. McKay thought it was cool.
- Oh, okay. Well it’s official.

756
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,800
你是不是没起过名字？从来没有？
You don’t get to name anything… ever.

757
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:06,600
基地，这里是小汽艇 我们要起飞了


Flight, this is Puddle Jumper;
we’re go to launch.

758
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,900
好吧，这里是基地，
我以为我们会用星门飞船这个名字？
All right, this is Flight.
I thought we were going with Gate Ship?

759
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,200
不行，基地
Negative, Flight.

760
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,600
请待命
Stand by.

761
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:15,400
这是一个穿越星门的飞船，我...
It’s a ship that goes through the gate. I…

762
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,700
好的
Fine.

763
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,700
小汽艇，你们可以起飞了
 Puddle Jumper you are clear for launch.

764
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:23,700
中尉，拨号吧
Dial it up, Lieutenant.

765
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:00,400
祝你们一路平安
Be safe.

766
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,800
哇，很酷哦
Wow. This is cool.

767
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,300
看来好像你已经掌握它的窍门了
Looks like you got the hang of it.

768
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,400
告诉你吧，中尉
I’ll tell you what Lieutenant

769
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,800
很多飞行员做梦都想驾驶这玩意
a lot of fighter pilots would kill to fly this thing.

770
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:18,800
好像它能看穿你的想法
It’s like it reads your mind.

771
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,700
这是你办到的？
Did you do that?

772
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,800
我正在想我们要去哪
I was just wondering where we go from here.

773
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,200
那我就当是你做到的罗
I’ll take that as a ‘yes’.

774
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,200
我们着陆后怎么去找他们？
So how do we find them once we land?

775
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:33,200
我也正在想这个问题
Well I’ve been thinking about that too.

776
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:45,400
我正在想一块美味的火鸡三明治
Now I’m thinking about a nice turkey sandwich.

777
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:53,100
值得尝尝
Worth a try.

778
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:59,800
锁定，装弹
Lock and load.

779
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,900
现在，第二队
All right, teams of two.

780
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,200
尽你们所能建好防线
Learn what you can;
lay down the defenses as you see fit.

781
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:20,300
如果需要的话 我会炸掉这个地方


I wanna be able to light this place up if we have to.

782
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:23,100
两响后允许交谈 遵命，长官


- Two clicks and you’re clear to talk.
- Yes sir.

783
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,900
不要与敌人交战
Do not engage the enemy.

784
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:29,900
你跟我来
You’re with me.

785
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
你现在一定感到饿了吧？
You must feel hunger by now.

786
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,000
我还以为进来是是最难的一关呢
I thought getting in was gonna be the hard part.

787
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,000
这是我们看到的第一个人
That’s the first one we’ve seen.

788
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,300
这个移动的小点应该就是他
The moving dot should be him.

789
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,300
去那里
Over there.

790
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,900
没错，这是你
Yeah, that’s you.

791
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:03,900
就是说，我们有一个生命显示仪了？
So, we got ourselves a Life Signs Detector.

792
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,900
以后再给他命名吧
You can name it later.

793
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,100
少校
- Major.

794
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:20,900
嘘
- Shh.

795
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:21,800
你们还好吗？
- Are you all right?

796
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:22,800
你怎么找到我们的？
- How did you find us?

797
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:27,000
我儿子还活着吗？ 他很好，正在等你呢


- Is my son alive?
- He’s well and waiting for you.

798
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,100
萨姆勒上校在哪儿？ 幻影族把他带走了


- Where’s Colonel Sumner?
- He was taken by the Wraith.

799
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,400
我们不知道去哪儿了
We don’t know where.

800
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,800
那什么时候呢？
- How about when?

801
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,300
不久
- Not long.

802
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,600
我知道有些不对劲
I knew something had to go wrong.

803
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,100
这是斯塔克豪斯，请说，长官
This is Stackhouse, go ahead Sir.

804
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,300
来个诱敌行动怎么样？
How ‘bout a diversion a little bit?

805
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:43,100
我们需要你在外面制造些动静 遵命，长官


- We’re gonna need to make some noise out there.
- Yes, Sir.

806
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,200
埋一个C4 塑胶炸弹，炸个洞出来
Rig up the C4 to blow a hole

807
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,389
等我发出暗号，你就带他们逃出来
and get these people out of here
on my signal, all right?

808
01:09:48,731 --> 01:09:51,651
我可以用这个东西找到上校，
这附近没有那么多的幻影族人
I can find the Colonel with this,
there aren’t that many Wraith around.

809
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:53,914
我应该能办到的
I should be able to do this.

810
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,600
如果我二十分钟之内还没回来 把这洞炸掉，然后逃出去


If I’m not back in 20 minutes,
blow the cells and get out.

811
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,000
你是唯一能带他们飞出去的人了
You’re the only one who
can fly these people out of here.

812
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,400
我会带所有人都飞出去，包括上校在内
Yeah I’m gonna fly us all out of here,
including the Colonel.

813
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,800
我是说我应该去救上校
I’m saying I should be the one to go, Sir.

814
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:10,800
二十分钟，我会找到他的
Twenty minutes, I’ll find him.

815
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,200
你叫什么？
What do you call yourself?

816
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,600
马歇尔·萨姆勒上校
Colonel Marshall Sumner,

817
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,400
美国海军陆战队
United States Marine Corps.

818
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:31,000
你不太害怕？是因为勇气还是无知？
So little fear. Is it valor or ignorance?

819
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:35,700
我们穿越星门进行和平的宇宙探险
We traveled through the stargate
as peaceful explorers.

820
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:38,300
你必须吃东西
You must eat,

821
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,700
但是你抵抗了饥饿，为什么？
yet you resist your hunger. Why?

822
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:42,800
你为什么把我们的人关到监狱里？
Why have you taken my people prisoner?

823
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:47,800
你们闯入了我们的食品场
You trespassed upon our feeding ground

824
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:53,300
食品场？
Feeding ground?

825
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:56,200
所有的生物都必须吃东西
All living things must eat.

826
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,200
我相信在这一点上我们是一样的
In this I am sure we are similar.

827
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,600
你现在已经饿了
You feel hunger even now,

828
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,700
我能感觉到
I can sense it.

829
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,500
但是，你在抵抗你的饥饿感
Yet, you resist.

830
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,100
为什么？
 Why?

831
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:14,200
你为什么关心这个？
Why do you care?

832
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:18,200
饥饿
Hunger…

833
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:23,200
是很不好受的
is distasteful.

834
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,400
我感觉“食物”们好像不同意
Looks to me like the food didn’t agree with him.

835
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,600
萨姆勒上校，这一点我们很不同
There we are quite dissimilar,
Colonel Sumner.

836
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:38,600
我不需要让食物同意我们的看法
We don’t require our food to agree with us.

837
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:58,200
你们的星球叫什么名字？
What do you call your world?

838
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:05,100
你们的星球叫什么名字？
你们的星球叫什么名字？
What do you call your world?
What do you call your world?

839
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,600
地球
Earth.

840
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:17,600
不在我们的星系里吧？
It is not among our stars.

841
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,600
不在
No.

842
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,100
给我讲讲地球
Tell me of earth.

843
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:27,100
像你这样的在地球上有多少？
How many more are there of your kind.

844
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,300
几千？
Thousands?

845
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:35,300
几百万？还是更多？
Millions? More?

846
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:43,400
一万年以来，我们的食品
从来没有如此丰富过
Our feeding ground has not been
so rich in ten thousand years.

847
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,600
你的意志很强大
Your will is strong.

848
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:15,600
这个尸体渴望新生
This one begged for his life.

849
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:20,400
这就是你们打算对我和我的人民做的吗？
Is that the kind of treatment I
can expect for myself and my people?

850
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:25,400
正如我所说的，所有的生物都必须吃东西
As I have said, all living things must eat.

851
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,600
那就没什么好谈的了
Then we’re done talking.

852
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,400
我认为不是
I think not.

853
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:36,400
跪下
Kneel.

854
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:50,100
我好久没有碰到过如此强大的意志了
I have not tasted such strength in so long.

855
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,800
去死吧
Go to hell.

856
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:02,800
第一个地球人
Earth first.

857
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,600
我要减少你多少年的寿命，
你才能告诉我想所知道的东西？
How many years must I take from you before you tell us what I wish to know?

858
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:19,300
还是要我把它们全部夺走？
Or shall I take them all?

859
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,700
这个新的食品场在哪里？
Where is this new feeding ground?

860
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:35,700
我不会告诉你的
I won’t-

861
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:45,500
把他带过来
Bring him.

862
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:57,500
你的手感觉如何？
How’s the hand feeling?

863
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,700
好多了
Much better.

864
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:06,700
听你这么说我真失望
I’m sorry to hear that.

865
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,900
你怎么会有这个东西？
How did this come to you?

866
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:19,900
我忘了
I don’t remember.

867
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:29,300
引爆
Light it up.

868
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:38,900
隐蔽
Cover.

869
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:53,700
这样应该能杀死你
That has to kill you.

870
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,800
你怎么找到我的
How’d you find me?

871
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:05,900
顺着你的脚印，我们快走吧，长官
Tread marks, standard issue. Sir, let’s go.

872
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:09,800
你不知道你们这样做的后果
You don’t know what you have done.

873
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:14,800
我们是这些睡着的同类的保护者
We are merely the caretakers for those that sleep.

874
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:20,000
当我死了，其它人就会醒
When I die the others will waken.

875
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:26,000
所有的都会醒
All of them.

876
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:35,400
她在说什么？
What’s she talking about?

877
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:38,700
还有多少敌人？
How many are left?

878
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,500
长官，我们得赶快走
Sir, we need to leave.

879
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,000
贝慈，我们撤了
Bates, we’re on the go.

880
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:01,000
- 我们就在这，萨姆勒上校呢？
- 没有救出来
- So are we. Colonel Sumner?
- Negative.

881
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:05,500
韦尔博士
Dr. Weir!

882
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,700
我们接到了来自整个城市的报告
We’re getting reports in from all over the city.

883
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:11,000
一些，很有趣的东西
Some… uh… pretty interesting stuff.

884
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,500
我们只能给部分地区供应能量
We’ve only been able to provide
power to certain sections,

885
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:18,500
但是即使那样，即将发生的…
but even then,
the things that are coming up are just-

886
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
我不应该让他们去
I should never have let them go.

887
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,200
因为不值得？
For what it’s worth,

888
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:30,200
你的决策是正确的
you made the right decision.

889
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:35,200
给他们时间
Give them time.

890
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:39,700
少校
Major,

891
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:41,500
现在汽艇很安全
the Jumper is secure for the moment,

892
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,000
但我们有大麻烦了
- but we have a big problem.

893
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,100
中尉，带这六个人走
- Lieutenant, take our six.

894
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:47,300
我把他们带到汽艇上去
I’m gonna take them back to the Jumper.

895
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:52,300
我就跟在你后面
Be right behind you.

896
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,500
那什么都没有
There’s nothing there.

897
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,700
我确定我看见什么了
I was sure I saw something.

898
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,500
只有幻影族想让你看到的东西
Only what the Wraith wish you to see.

899
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,000
开火会暴露我们的位置
Firing your weapon will reveal our position.

900
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,000
走吧
Come on.

901
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:31,100
快进去！
Get in!

902
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,500
谢谢你，长官
Thank you, Sir.

903
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:05,500
不要总这样好吗？
Let’s try not to make a habit of this.

904
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:20,300
我们赶快进去！
We have incoming!

905
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:25,300
天啊，现在我该想什么？
Okay, now what am I thinking?

906
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:33,900
你们都还好吗？
Everybody okay back there?

907
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:38,900
我们很好
We are well enough.

908
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,000
希望刚才那是最困难的部分
Hope that was the hard part.

909
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:53,200
该死！
Crap.

910
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:58,200
我觉得我们还没到最困难的一关
I don’t think we’ve gotten to the hard part yet.

911
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:06,800
我们怎么办？
What can we do?

912
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,900
只要他们看不见我们，我们就安全了
We’re safe as long as they can’t see us.

913
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:10,200
他们不用看见我们，
我们只有一条道可走
They don't have to.
There’s only one way for us to go.

914
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,200
只要我们一启动星门，
他们就会盲目射击
The minute we activate the stargate
they could start shooting blind

915
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:17,200
我们一靠近星门，
他们就会把我们射下来
and blow us away on our approach.

916
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,000
那我们怎么穿越星门？
Then how can we get through?

917
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,000
我们必须把他们引开，然后再返回来
We have to draw them away
from the gate and double back.

918
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,000
我一下命令，你们就准备拨号
Be prepared to dial the gate on my mark.

919
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,800
你看见那有个
好像武器操纵台的东西吗？
You see anything like a weapons console over there?

920
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,600
试着再次隐身
Try and go invisible again.

921
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:12,600
我试了，但好像坏了，启动星门
I tried, it must be damaged.
Dial the gate.

922
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:19,200
星际之门打开！
Gate activation!

923
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:24,200
打开防御系统！
Raise the shield.

924
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,700
在下一次经过时准备按下身份码
Be ready to punch in your code on the next pass.

925
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:37,500
这个东西覆盖的距离有多远？
What’s the range on these things?

926
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:42,500
收到身份验证码了吗？
Do we have an identification code?

927
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:48,700
还没有
Nothing yet.

928
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:51,400
输入验证码
Enter your code.

929
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,600
坚持住
Hang on.

930
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,600
我收到了福特中尉的身份验证码
I’m reading Lt. Ford’s IDC.

931
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:01,600
让他进来
Let him in.

932
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:23,600
再多等几秒钟
Give them a few more seconds.

933
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,500
我们开的太快了
We’re going too fast.

934
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:30,500
我知道
I know.

935
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:42,400
再次启动防御系统！
Reactivate the shield!

936
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,100
女士们先生们
Ladies and Gentlemen,

937
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,000
欢迎来到亚特兰蒂斯
Welcome to Atlantis.

938
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,800
请一直坐在这里
Please remain seated

939
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,800
直到小汽艇完全停下来
until the Puddle Jumper
has come to a full complete stop.

940
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:27,000
我猜这就是家了
- I guess this is home now.

941
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,000
大概是吧
- Guess so.

942
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:35,900
我在想一个有海景的小地方
I’m thinking of a little place with an ocean view.

943
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,400
很不一般
Out of the way.

944
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:43,000
少校
Major,

945
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,700
中尉
Lieutenant,

946
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:48,500
我认为现在这个时候最值得打开它
I thought the occasion merited opening this.

947
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,500
奥尼尔将军的奖赏
Compliments of General O’Neill.

948
01:24:55,400 --> 01:25:00,400
干杯
Cheers.

949
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,800
你做得很棒，约翰
You did good, John.

950
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,700
我不这么认为
I don’t know about that.

951
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:10,700
嗨，你没有办法拯救萨姆勒上校
Hey, there was no way you
could have saved Colonel Sumner.

952
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,200
我必须承受这个结果
I have to live with it.

953
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,500
我开始觉得你是正确的，
我让事情变得更糟
I’m beginning to think you were right,
I have made things much worse.

954
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,000
我没有让大家交更多的朋友
I haven’t made us many more friends out there.

955
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
没有吗？
No?

956
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
看看你周围
Look around you.

957
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:41,900
谢帕德少校，她说的对
I agree, Major Sheppard.

958
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:58,000
你已经赢得了我的友谊
You have earned both
my friendship

959
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,900
还有我族人的
and that of my people.

960
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:05,900
在我们的帮助下，
你们可以交更多的朋友
With our help you will make many more friends.

961
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,200
我怎么不能像他那样交朋友？
How come I never make friends like that?

962
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,900
你需要多多外出
You need to get out more.

963
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:19,300
但我们在另一个星球上，
你能多出去多少次呢？
We’re in another galaxy.
How much more out can you get?

964
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:24,300
这东西里有柠檬吗？
Is there lemon in this?

965
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,900
还有一件事情，少校
One more thing Major.

966
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,500
有些问题需要你考虑一下
It’s something I’d like you to sleep on.

967
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,100
我已经想过了，但是......
- I have a few thoughts for it myself, but-

968
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:32,800
想过什么？
- Thoughts for what?

969
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,300
谁会是你队伍中的成员？
Who the members of your team might be?

970
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,100
我的队伍？
My team?

971
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:41,200
现在你已经是有头衔的军官了
Well you are the ranking military officer now,

972
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:46,000
或者你需要我提醒一下那件事？
or do you need to be reminded of that?

973
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,300
我们需要从这里回去
We need to get back out there;

974
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:53,200
好好去做我们该做的事情
do what we came to do.

975
01:26:53,200 --> 01:27:03,200
你确实意识到我能把大家带进各种... 麻烦 对吗？


You do realize I could get us into all sorts of
… trouble. Ya ready?
