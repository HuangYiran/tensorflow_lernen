{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Blackwood?

3
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir?

4
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:39,068
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Blackwood, I'm sorry.
You did ring, sir?

00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:40,732
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come down.

00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so...

7
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,245
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So very sorry.

8
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't see the steps.

9
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They made me do it.

10
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't...

11
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I want to see my child again,

12
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:45,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I must comply.

13
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Blackwood.

15
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Precious teeth. Beautiful teeth.

16
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ransom for my boy.

17
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I brought you something more to eat.

18
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,221
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not children's teeth like you wanted,

19
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,441
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but please accept them

20
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,318
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in exchange for him.

21
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Children's teeth.

22
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, that's the best I could do.

23
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,493
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And they're my own. You see?

24
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My own.

25
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please. Give me back my son!

26
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:44,254
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, your son is down here.
Reach for him.

27
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,885
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son? Son!

28
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,546
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son!

29
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grab my hand!

30
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,391
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's landed.

31
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,765
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think? Too much?

32
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's perfect. Just like you.

33
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,688
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's my girl.

34
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:13,815
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally?

35
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow! Look how tall you are!

36
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,787
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you, 17 now?

37
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, you know how old I am.

38
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. I'm being silly.

39
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey.
- Good morning, sir.

40
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

41
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

42
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,416
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, this is Kim. Kim, Sally.

43
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,009
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Sally. It's nice to meet you.

44
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you. I love you.

45
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

46
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,015
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about a picture?
You got your camera?

47
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's good to see you.

48
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,276
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning, Rhode Island!

49
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

50
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got fog this morning
and a slight chance of a shower later on.

51
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:00,988
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smell that fresh air, kiddo?

52
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure beats the smog of LA, huh?

53
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,384
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to call Mom now.

54
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,968
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just press one and the green.

55
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:27,606
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, you've called Joanne
and the magical Sally! Leave us a message.

56
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:08,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}L.C. delivered the flooring.
If it rains, I'm afraid it's going to warp.

57
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,436
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, just put it in the garage.

58
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, say hello to Mr. Harris.

59
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,855
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice to meet you.

60
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come take a look at the house.

61
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Harris. Mr. Harris,
would you give me a hand...

62
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,965
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How's it going?
- Good.

63
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- When do you think you'll be finished?
- No problem.

64
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good, huh?

65
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It smells funny.
- You should have smelled it before.

66
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They had moldy newspapers everywhere,

67
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,011
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and dead pigeons all over the floor
and poop.

68
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Lots of it.
- It's Jacoby's office.

69
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Jacoby.

70
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, hey, Michelle. Sorry.

71
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Hold on. I'll check.

72
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got the photographs?

73
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,085
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like to draw, too.

74
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You work here?

75
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,219
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Sally, I live here.

76
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,094
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the interior designer.
Do you know what that is?

77
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course you do.

78
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,892
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see all the animal
paintings and friezes?

79
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're by Emerson Blackwood,
a man who once lived here.

80
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was a very famous wildlife painter.

81
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Sally, look.

82
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to try?

83
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,626
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you have there?

84
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I found it.
- That's mine.

85
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,794
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was my grandmother's.
When I was little, my mother gave it to me.

86
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom gave me to my dad.

87
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:48,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally?

88
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to see your room?

89
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think?

90
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,839
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kim and I worked really hard
to get it ready. Check this out.

91
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's pretty great, huh?

92
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,058
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It looks better at night.

93
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long am I staying here?

94
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,776
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did your mother tell you?

95
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:47,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She told me I was coming to visit.
But then she packed all my clothes.

96
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She didn't explain anything to you?

97
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,161
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No.
- Sally.

98
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,206
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your mother and I are worried about you.

99
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She thinks that maybe you're feeling sad

100
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:02,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and she thought that...
Well, we thought that perhaps a change

101
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,963
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}might be good for you and that you could
come and live here with Kim and me

102
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}until we finish the work on the house
and sell it.

103
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we could move
somewhere else and...

104
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally? Come on. Open the door.

105
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Let me in.

106
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you going to marry her?

107
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's between Kim and me.

108
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,616
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom said you only liked her
because she was young.

109
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,373
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But she isn't. She's old.

110
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally.

111
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,001
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open the door.

112
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:45,503
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, sweetheart. Open the door.
Sally, please, let's talk about this.

113
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I know...

114
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know it must be tough.

115
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:01,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've had a long flight,
and it's strange being in a new house.

116
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to go to bed now.

117
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,144
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

118
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't forget to brush your teeth.

119
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,757
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'd be a terrible poker player.

120
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've been ironing that shirt
for half-an-hour.

121
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,811
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She sure didn't take to me.

122
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't take it personally.
She's like that with everybody.

123
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those pills she takes, what are they?

124
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Adderall, I think.

125
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,529
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus.

126
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:58,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's her mother for you.
That woman medicated our dogs.

127
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what about Jacoby?

128
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His assistant said he still
hasn't looked at the new photographs yet.

129
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's had them for a week.
- I know.

130
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're still in the running,
and he's still coming to the dinner.

131
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He should just give us the cover.
- Yes, he should.

132
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He gave it to the Spencer restoration
two years ago

133
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,304
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you have done miracles here.

134
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,687
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have done miracles here.
It's not all about me.

135
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,182
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

136
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are new?

137
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,103
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah.
- Great.

138
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we get the cover of
Architectural Digest,

139
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we won't need to take
out another bank loan, will we?

140
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,704
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what your
daughter told me today?

141
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

142
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said your wife gave her to you.

143
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kids say all kinds of
things they don't mean.

144
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It couldn't have gone any worse today.

145
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,051
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel like the evil stepmother.

146
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:05,642
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The evil and very old stepmother.
Let's not forget the old part.

147
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:10,101
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I was kind of thinking
you were looking a little ancient.

148
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,606
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

149
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,445
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The stuffed bear? What was I thinking?

150
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. It's great. She likes it.
I saw it in her room.

151
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On her bed?

152
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, above the bed. Hanging by a noose.

153
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's okay.
Nice sign of affection, I think.

154
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:20,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally. Her name is Sally.

155
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally!

156
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think?

157
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,316
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Looks great.

158
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Have you seen Sally?
- Yeah, she's on the bench.

159
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally!

160
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is not safe for you back here.

161
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,817
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. What's going on? Everything okay?

162
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep her out from the back of the house.

163
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,983
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She could fall in.
We'd be in a hell of a mess.

164
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,861
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't do anything.

165
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:11,698
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's pits. Old wells.
It's dangerous for a child.

166
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Harris is right, Sally. He knows.
His grandfather worked at the house.

167
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You shouldn't be back here.
- But I found a basement.

168
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is no basement.

169
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy, Harris. I'll take her. It's okay.

170
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's there! It's right there!

171
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a reason
this house is called Fallen Mill.

172
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The English had a mill here,
and it fell into a sinkhole.

173
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why most of the houses around here
don't have basements.

174
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This one does.

175
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:42,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You may want to check this out.
- It's unsafe for a child.

176
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,229
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pull on that.

177
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look! I told you it was here!

178
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you believe this?

179
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is definitely hollow.

180
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to get some tools.

181
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You sure you want to do this now?
- Of course! You kidding?

182
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,968
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can fix this easy if we have to.

183
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You may want to step back.

184
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Hurst, I...

185
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a door in here.

186
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,788
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you put the old house keys?

187
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're in your junk drawer in the office.

188
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

189
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,174
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have a look.

190
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,364
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, wow.

191
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,204
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You be careful, Sally. Okay?
- Okay.

192
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,581
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How the hell did we miss this?

193
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That must be the garden window.

194
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,313
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all of his paints and old
color pencils. This is amazing.

195
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,665
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. Alex, look at this.

196
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,507
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Harris, did you know about this?

197
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This place isn't safe. Especially for kids.

198
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,051
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. I'll keep an eye on her.

199
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This must be where Blackwood worked.

200
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found another door.

201
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look at these sketches.
- It's an ash pit, I think.

202
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,854
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. It's bolted shut.

203
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These are incredible.

204
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Let's go, Sally.

205
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,635
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Sally. Let's go.

206
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:58,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, come on.

207
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This must be like King Tut's tomb for you.

208
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:07,146
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which is why we shouldn't be touching
anything. This stuff must be valuable.

209
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,558
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She's gone.
- No, she will come back.

210
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They always do.

211
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, they always do.

212
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,021
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think that's important, Alan.

213
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I just need to make sure I get
the paintings and furniture

214
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,614
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}back in time for the dinner.

215
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You told me you could.

216
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,494
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.
How long have we known each other?

217
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll write you a post-dated check.

218
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,454
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on.

219
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:15,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's either walnut or mahogany,
I think. Yeah.

220
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,962
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you are.
I thought maybe we could bake scones.

221
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:25,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promised Mrs. Underhill
we wouldn't make too much of a mess.

222
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. That's all right.

223
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,641
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have you got there?

224
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My doll. And my drawing stuff.

225
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:44,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like it's just you and I
baking scones today.

226
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,911
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I made sandwiches for everyone.

227
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,548
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, open the grate.

228
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:44,128
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, open the grate. Set us free.

229
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:51,643
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

230
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,271
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you look like?

231
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,808
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've been locked up for so long.

232
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Set us free.

233
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,947
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come down.
You'll see what it's like down here.

234
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,618
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute, will ya?

235
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's other children down here.
They're just like you.

236
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come and play with them.

237
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,494
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally?

238
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally.

239
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,961
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing down here?

240
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I heard something.
- Rats, probably. It's time for dinner.

241
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It was a voice.
- Really smart rats, then.

242
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Listen.

243
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,539
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing. Come on. Let's go, kiddo.

244
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,806
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I forgot my bag.
- Hurry it up, then.

245
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,053
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, now!

246
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can get this tomorrow. We can't
get the rest of these for two weeks.

247
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,461
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the burnt umber?

248
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's much warmer,
and we can get it for half the price.

249
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,551
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You not hungry? Sally?

250
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,771
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you like rice?

251
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,979
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Underhill made apple pie for dessert.

252
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,528
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple pie has gluten, and Mommy says
gluten is bad for my concentration.

253
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, come on. You love apple pie.

254
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,358
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can worry
about your concentration tomorrow.

255
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy says no gluten.

256
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your mother filling your head with?

257
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How about some chocolate milk?
- No.

258
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,286
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll make something else.
- Hold on.

259
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,289
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, you need to eat this,
or you can go to your room. Okay?

260
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, Dad.

261
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,263
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

262
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did that work on you when you were a kid?
- She's testing us, Kim.

263
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what kids do.
Who's the parent here?

264
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,184
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Certainly not me.

265
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,814
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't mean that.

266
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,897
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. You're right. I'm not a parent.

267
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We talked about this, remember?
- No, you told me about this, Alex.

268
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,113
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not sure
I'm ready to be anybody's mother.

269
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,699
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had a hard enough time
getting over my own childhood

270
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to have to deal with somebody else's.

271
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, will you help me with this, please?

272
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I realize this is terrible timing,
but I don't have a choice.

273
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,668
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't just send her back.

274
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not what I'm asking you to do.

275
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apple pie.

276
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

277
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,363
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello?
- Hi, Alex. It's Joanne.

278
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,994
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hi, Joanne.
- Can I speak to Sally?

279
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, you can't.
- Why not?

280
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,453
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because she's asleep.
We're three hours ahead, remember?

281
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:09,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What were you thinking not telling her
she was going to be living here?

282
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:18,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and I had a conversation.
I asked you if you wanted me to tell her.

283
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,093
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the one who wanted her here.

284
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:21,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you. I love you.

285
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you just speak to me?

286
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:35,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you. I love you.

287
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you.

288
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you.

289
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you.

290
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,058
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you.

291
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,396
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The light, it hurts us.

292
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Turn out the light.

293
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:03,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you.

294
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn out the light.

295
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We want to be friends.

296
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,549
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's my doll?

297
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:23,045
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With us. Sally's doll is with us.

298
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,264
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

299
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're your friends.

300
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,021
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Friends?

301
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:35,973
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where?

302
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,019
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come down to the basement
and play with us.

303
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,445
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you?

304
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,421
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you?

305
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:08,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hungry.

306
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hungry.

307
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,011
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very hungry.

308
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have food.

309
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me see you.

310
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,026
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't hurt you, I promise.

311
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,154
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally?

312
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you doing under there?
- I'm looking for my doll.

313
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,582
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Looking for what?
- I'm looking for my doll.

314
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about Teddy instead?

315
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. That's all right.

316
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did you lose a tooth?
- That's not mine.

317
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,769
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I found it.
- You found it? Here in the house?

318
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

319
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I call Mommy now?

320
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's too late. She's probably asleep.

321
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think you should keep this.
It's not very sanitary.

322
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about this light? Should I...

323
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:15,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave it on, please.

324
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,326
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, well, sleep well.

325
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,923
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, would you do me a favor?

326
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you try to, maybe,
be friends with Kim?

327
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes.
- Thanks, kiddo.

328
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,583
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kim, have you seen my razor?

329
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to leave in five minutes.

330
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. Have you seen my razor?
- Here, take mine.

331
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Five minutes.

332
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My dress.

333
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:54,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally. I want to talk to you downstairs
right now.

334
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I cannot believe you cut up Kim's clothes.

335
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't do it.

336
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,815
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I didn't do anything. I swear.
- Stop lying.

337
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,819
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a horrible thing to do.
And it was dangerous.

338
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,363
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could have cut yourself.
What did you use, my razor?

339
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me see your hands.

340
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's mine.
- What is this?

341
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,576
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you get this?

342
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,408
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let me go home.
- You can't go home.

343
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just let me go home.

344
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:22,917
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry about this.

345
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:27,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's never done anything like this before.
She's obviously very angry about something.

346
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alex, that is not anger. That is fear.

347
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to go. Mrs. Underhill,

348
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kim and I have an appointment
at the historical society.

349
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll be back this afternoon.

350
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,348
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, we're going out.

351
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,431
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to Mrs. Underhill
and do what she says.

352
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,183
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you think about
what you need to say to Kim, okay?

353
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally.

354
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,716
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you there?

355
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,054
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you cut Kim's clothes?

356
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,771
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have my dad's razor?

357
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,067
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to tell me the truth.

358
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,237
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you want to be friends.

359
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,624
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't be angry.

360
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,329
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally's not angry.

361
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,918
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're angry.

362
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,467
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm not angry.

363
00:41:55,388 --> 00:42:00,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't want to, but we do.

364
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,727
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come down here, Sally.

365
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,348
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come down and play.

366
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,111
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said you were hungry.

367
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,621
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you like raisins?

368
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We said we liked them.

369
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,046
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See? Delicious.

370
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,933
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Delicious. Yeah.

371
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,469
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So delicious.

372
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,223
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you do something bad?

373
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to answer if
you want to be friends.

374
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,278
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, friend.

375
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally?

376
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing
down here in the dark?

377
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Were you talking to someone?

378
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:10,998
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there someone here with you?

379
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I'm all alone.

380
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,375
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nobody here.

381
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:24,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you go help Mrs. Underhill
make lunch?

382
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,851
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on. Off you go now.

383
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:31,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right. Up those steps!
Quick as you can, now!

384
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,325
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Harris. You old fool.

385
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:41,376
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear. I didn't tell them anything!

386
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,366
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

387
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, please!

388
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,198
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get away!

389
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:50,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had an accident! Call for help!

390
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,775
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't look.

391
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,821
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could hear screams down there.

392
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Noises.
- Did you see anything?

393
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He asked me to leave the cellar.

394
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was so dark in there,
he must have stumbled.

395
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,616
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mr. Hurst, thank God!
- What happened?

396
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:39,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you William Harris' employer?
- Yeah.

397
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's been an accident.

398
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:45,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you okay? Where's Sally?
- I'm sorry. She saw him.

399
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,213
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried to cover her eyes,
and I was too late.

400
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:48,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where is she?
- She's in the garden.

401
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,471
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am sorry!

402
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally?

403
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:14,574
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi.

404
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you scared?

405
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:23,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want to talk about it?

406
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is Mr. Harris going to die?

407
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,008
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Sally.

408
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,845
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is going to be okay.

409
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I show you something?

410
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is my favorite part of the house.

411
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,234
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blackwood loved nature.

412
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:32,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He imported these fish from Japan.
And so did we.

413
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:34,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're called koi.

414
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:37,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're considered magical.

415
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Badgers can spot them
against the mud at the bottom

416
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:43,538
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because of their bright colors.

417
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:50,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what makes them special
is also what makes them vulnerable.

418
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They have to be tough.

419
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:56,464
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you, too, Sally.

420
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:03,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't touch your clothes.

421
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,267
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I swear to God, I never touched them!

422
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:12,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I didn't touch them.
- Sally.

423
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:16,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't! Didn't cut them, I promise.

424
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:19,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't care about my clothes.

425
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't really tell. 1804, I think.

426
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's hard to see.
The coin is pretty worn down.

427
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,383
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She probably found it
in Blackwood's studio.

428
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,637
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want her
going down there anymore.

429
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm worried about her, Kim. It's not safe.

430
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is Joanne.
- Mommy?

431
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:58,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, sweetie, it's you! How are you?

432
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I come home?

433
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:04,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to come...
The sashimi. Stuart, the sashimi.

434
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,492
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't like it here.
- You what?

435
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:11,505
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, don't fret. It's so beautiful there.
You just need to get used to it.

436
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's cold.

437
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,585
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Honey, what?
- My bed is too big.

438
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,845
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sweetheart.
- And I think I'm getting sick.

439
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not getting sick.

440
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:24,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It will take a little tiny bit of getting used to,
but you are going to be so happy there.

441
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,684
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay? I promise. You'll get used to it.

442
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:31,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got to go, honey. Mommy's got to go.

443
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,769
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see you soon. Bye!

444
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:31,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kim?

445
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,464
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Don't leave.
- What's wrong?

446
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:46,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even when I'm asleep.

447
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And don't turn off the lights.

448
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be right here.

449
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

450
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:24,986
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kim?

451
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:39,163
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you. I love you.

452
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:39,898
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy! Daddy!

453
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy, please!

454
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:43,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy!

455
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:47,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, what's the matter?

456
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want them to come anymore.

457
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:57,616
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who, Sally?

458
00:54:58,504 --> 00:54:59,619
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The little things.

459
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They live in the basement.
They gave me the silver dollar.

460
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:09,428
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They said they wanted to be my friend.
But they're horrible and mean.

461
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You just had a nightmare.
- Don't say that!

462
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,677
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay.

463
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:20,059
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My bear.

464
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:23,107
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look what they did to my bear.

465
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:58,394
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your dad tells me art is your
favorite subject. I wish I could draw.

466
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,929
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drawing is easy.

467
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The other kids can't do feet and hands.

468
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you say "the other kids,"
do you feel they're different from you?

469
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My doctor back home asked me that.

470
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:12,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was your answer?

471
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:20,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Let's start with something easier.

472
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your favorite color?

473
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is that? Purple?

474
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,789
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Black.

475
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:33,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about these little things you saw?
What do you think they are?

476
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:42,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fairies.

477
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,015
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or gnomes.

478
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:46,353
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But scary ones?

479
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:51,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you say they know your name?

480
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:58,324
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They talk to you?

481
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:00,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

482
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do they say?

483
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They want to play with me.

484
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:11,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that all?

485
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They say my parents don't love me.

486
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,558
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I go now?

487
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a few more questions, okay?

488
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:49,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is a lot of anxiety in that little girl
and a deep belief that she's not wanted.

489
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe that's what's triggering
these fantastic episodes.

490
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:56,883
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She told me she found a little tray filled
with teeth right inside that fireplace.

491
00:57:57,057 --> 00:58:00,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. She found a tooth,
but that doesn't mean anything, does it?

492
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:05,721
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's constructing this elaborate fantasy
about wrinkles, claws, fangs.

493
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:08,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's individuated
each one of those things,

494
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}her imaginary world, its inhabitants.

495
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's as detailed as any
I've ever encountered.

496
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:15,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do we do?

497
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to try her on a
stronger medication, for a start.

498
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,327
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll ask her doctor in LA to send me a copy
of her charts.

499
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You call my office,
make another appointment.

500
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,446
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, great.

501
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:25,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meanwhile, I'll give you something
to help her sleep.

502
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to be late. I can't believe it.

503
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:38,296
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we don't get the extension on this loan,
we're not going to get the paintings

504
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or the furniture back on time.

505
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We forgot the invitations
for the historical society.

506
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:47,179
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we should just
postpone the dinner.

507
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:50,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kim, it's Architectural Digest.
We have to get the house on the cover.

508
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:51,899
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I know.
- If we don't,

509
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm never going to get my career back,
and we're not going to sell the place.

510
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How often have we talked about this?
- What about what's been happening?

511
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,524
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Harris? That was an accident.

512
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm talking about Sally.
- It's all in her head!

513
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's real to her.
It doesn't matter if we see it.

514
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on!
- Calm down!

515
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,499
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to walk. It'll be faster.
I'll see you back at home.

516
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:39,652
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not sure how lucid he'll be.
He's pretty heavily sedated.

517
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,691
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Harris, I know this is difficult,

518
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:17,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I need to understand something.

519
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:21,323
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to know what Sally saw
so that I can help her.

520
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:26,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is she out of the house?

521
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:28,738
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

522
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out.

523
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:36,372
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She needs to be out of there.

524
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

525
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,714
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why was that room sealed up?

526
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandfather.

527
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:54,723
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your grandfather closed it up?

528
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,562
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes.
- Why?

529
01:00:58,613 --> 01:00:59,728
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After...

530
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:02,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After...

531
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:07,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After what?

532
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:10,913
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blackwood.

533
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about Blackwood?

534
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:22,259
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lot 1134.

535
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Public library.

536
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:31,559
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get her out of the house.

537
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:03,466
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The library will be closing in 15 minutes.

538
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:07,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The library will be closing in 15 minutes.
Thank you.

539
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:10,931
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me.

540
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:14,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for the librarian.

541
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:18,811
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lot 1134.

542
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Emerson Blackwood, Special Collections.
One sec.

543
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right this way.

544
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:53,433
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't remember the last time
anyone requested these. They're beautiful.

545
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,977
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a designer.
I've been working at Fallen Mill.

546
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,521
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow. Now, that's a privilege.

547
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:02,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Personally, I think Emerson Blackwood
rivaled Audubon.

548
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,361
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come across his mural?

549
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,689
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A mural? Where?

550
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:11,276
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There in the house, supposedly.
If you do, I'd love to see it.

551
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:47,854
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

552
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:11,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, it's pretty ironic, really.

553
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:15,974
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For a committed realist, someone who
insisted on drawing only from nature,

554
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:18,302
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to do these at the end of his life.

555
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:21,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've looked at everything by Blackwood,
and I've never seen any of these.

556
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:24,183
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wouldn't.
The family made it a restricted donation.

557
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- These may never be published.
- Is it possible to get copies?

558
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,442
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll see what I can do.

559
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:33,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Wrinkles, claws, teeth?"

560
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you ever read Machen?

561
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Arthur Machen. Welsh.

562
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:39,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He believed in fairy folk,

563
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:44,161
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}these ancient entities
from the netherworld, predating mankind.

564
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:48,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blackwood quotes him extensively.
Here, that line. There.

565
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"One life must be taken."

566
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:54,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These creatures had to take one human life
every time they emerged.

567
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:55,505
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to replenish their ranks.

568
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,889
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Many of these creatures fed on the bones,
the teeth of young children.

569
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then there's a truce, a pact of sorts,

570
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,561
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}between Pope Sylvester II
and these ancient beings

571
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the year 999.

572
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:12,985
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In exchange for human teeth, they start
leaving silver pieces under the pillow.

573
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:23,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, this is the last known drawing
by Emerson Blackwood,

574
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:28,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}made shortly before his disappearance
and the loss of his child.

575
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:30,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His child?

576
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blackwood's only son vanished, lost.

577
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:37,722
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not long after, Blackwood himself
disappeared without a trace.

578
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

579
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:40,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No! Please!

580
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,005
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

581
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:14,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, what's wrong?

582
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:16,904
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, open the door!

583
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God!

584
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:43,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dear, thank goodness you're home.

585
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:46,134
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where is she?
- I put her to bed.

586
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She wouldn't stop screaming.

587
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:00,986
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally?

588
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:44,491
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kim!

589
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:46,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's not down here.

590
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:49,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think she's run away.
She's done it before.

591
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:55,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once she tried to walk all the way back
to LA from our family home in Boston.

592
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't be surprised
if that's what she's doing.

593
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,886
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I went and visited Harris today.

594
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:14,893
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blackwood had a son. Did you know that?

595
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,225
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when he was eight, he disappeared.

596
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,185
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Blackwood vanished a few days later.

597
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you telling me this?

598
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:23,197
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A lot of what Blackwood wrote
at the end of his life,

599
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:27,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's awfully close to Sally's story,
gnomes, creatures, all of it.

600
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:28,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kim, don't tell me you believe this.

601
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:30,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something terrible happened
in that basement.

602
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We need to leave.
- What are you talking about?

603
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:35,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put a million miles
between us and that house.

604
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:39,005
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every cent I have is in that house.
And you're saying that we just walk away?

605
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:42,175
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I accept that
my daughter has problems, okay?

606
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,126
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. We all know that.

607
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,508
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they do not involve
monsters in the basement.

608
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:48,973
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There she is.

609
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:06,449
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Sally. Get in the car.

610
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:14,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, please, just tonight,
and after the party we'll talk, okay?

611
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:44,321
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Four, three, two and one.

612
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:46,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There.

613
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After the party, I will get you out of here.

614
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:53,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No matter what. I promise.

615
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,167
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sally!
- No.

616
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,626
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I took it from them.

617
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:06,376
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You can't have this.
- They stole it. You don't understand.

618
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:08,712
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I need it to fight back.
- Absolutely not.

619
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:09,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please!

620
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,221
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody believes me.

621
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally, I trust you,

622
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:23,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you can tell me anything at all.

623
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:33,823
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't like bright lights.Those things.

624
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,529
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't?

625
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:41,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I have a good idea.

626
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,635
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Jacoby, I am so
glad you could make it.

627
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Alex, call me Charles.
- Charles.

628
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:53,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- My wife, Evelyn.
- Hello, Alex.

629
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:54,803
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a pleasure. Come on in.

630
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:58,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The house looks absolutely fantastic.

631
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:00,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've done a remarkable job.

632
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:02,398
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, thank you.

633
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,605
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We'd love the nickel tour.
- Of course. That's the whole point.

634
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The foyer, obviously.

635
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:09,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The mahogany, we shipped from
the very same vendor

636
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:13,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that Blackwood used in London.
It's been in business since 1865.

637
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:16,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know Bill from the heritage board.

638
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:19,453
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Easy, Sally. Not everybody
wants to have their photograph taken.

639
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,092
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, Alex, where's Kim?

640
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:39,602
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think she's still upstairs.

641
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:43,682
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you step into the library,
grab a drink, and I'll join you in a moment.

642
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:11,884
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kim, hey, what's going on?

643
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:15,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her drawings.
They're exactly Blackwood's sketches.

644
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm sure she probably saw
your photographs and copied them.

645
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, she didn't.

646
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,645
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kim, please, Jacoby's here.

647
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:25,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Alex, this is your daughter!
- I know.

648
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,143
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is serious!

649
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:30,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just because you keep denying it
does not mean

650
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:32,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- it's not happening.
- Kim, I can't do...

651
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:35,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me, Mr. Hurst.
When should we serve dinner?

652
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:38,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ten minutes, please. Kim, everybody
is waiting. Will you come downstairs?

653
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:41,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We can talk about this later.
- No.

654
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:56,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I have proof, Dad. Look!
- Not now, honey.

655
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,842
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Please!
- Not now. Come on!

656
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:04,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome, everybody.

657
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:06,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, have a seat.

658
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:13,563
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I could just say a few words
to all of you friends of Fallen Mill,

659
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}both big and small.

660
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:19,444
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for joining us this evening.
It means a great deal to us.

661
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:24,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every aspect of this restoration
has followed the exact specifications

662
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:28,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and materials used
in the original construction of the house,

663
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:32,256
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}including the wood assembling techniques,
the layout in the kitchen,

664
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:34,587
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}even the lacquering process
for all the timber.

665
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:38,175
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's something Kim and I are very proud of,
and I'm sure all of you,

666
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:43,343
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with your vast array of expertise,
will appreciate the attention to detail.

667
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:47,062
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The art you see on the walls, the friezes,

668
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:50,186
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}even the furniture that you're sitting on,

669
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:56,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}has all been meticulously chosen,
reassembled or restored,

670
01:14:56,575 --> 01:15:00,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to, I think, truly represent the essence
of the Blackwood collection.

671
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:06,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, thank you to the heritage board
for their assistance,
and to the historical society

672
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:11,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and, of course, to our guest of honor,
Charles Jacoby.

673
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:17,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your interest in our projects is nothing
short of inspirational. So, thank you.

674
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And finally, to the house itself.

675
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May its newly restored life be long
and happy.

676
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,776
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess not everybody is a fan
of tonight's menu.

677
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:02,426
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Poor Sally. No one believes you.

678
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:21,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want?

679
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:24,465
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please just tell me what you want!

680
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:25,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We want you!

681
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:32,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy! Daddy, please!

682
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:37,774
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy!

683
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:41,521
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally?

684
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:43,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Daddy!
- Sally?

685
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:53,825
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Daddy, they're in here!

686
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:55,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open the door!

687
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,176
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Charles.
- What's going on in there?

688
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,314
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Get off of me! Stop it!

689
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:55,719
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally!

690
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:02,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sally. Sally.

691
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:04,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at me. Sally, look at me. Look at me.

692
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:08,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Picture, I took a picture.

693
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:20,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I think we better call it a night.
- I think we should.

694
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:31,096
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. It's okay.

695
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:02,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alex, can I talk to you?

696
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel like I have no idea what to do.

697
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love my daughter, Kim,

698
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:27,736
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I love you.

699
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:32,653
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you, too.

700
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should go, right?

701
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,915
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll get Sally ready.
- I'll get the car.

702
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:08,102
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Will you put this in the car?
- Yeah.

703
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kim?

704
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:42,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi.

705
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:45,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are we going?
