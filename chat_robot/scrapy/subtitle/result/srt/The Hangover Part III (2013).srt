菲爾，我發誓我不知道，我幾個月沒跟周聯絡了

Did you hear that guy?

第一天遇見他我就這麼覺得

你得幫我，我一個人沒法做

這上面寫的是周，你又怎麼不知道是周發的？{\i1\i}

394
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,652

那時候我以為是“Ciao”（義大利語），再見的意思

395
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,482
You know, like, <i>"Chow, arrivederci."</i>
你懂的啊，就好像，“再見，拜拜~”（均為義大利語）

Do you even know what's going on?
你們知不知道你們在幹嘛？

403
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,610

然後我們把周約出來-約出來？
