00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,200
{\a10}{\fs18}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\3c&H000000&}{\bord1}周六\N下午5点\N　\N

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,200
{\a10}{\fs18}{\c&HFFFFFF&}{\3c&H000000&}{\bord1}婚礼前25小时

3
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,536
马修和马尔文坐着公交车
Marshall and marvin were taking the bus

4
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:07,139
正赶着和我们相见于长岛的旅社
On their way to long island to meet up with us.

5
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,540
好啦 好啦 马尔文
there, there, little marvin.

6
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,142
不要再哭啦
Let no more tears fall.

7
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:13,812
我们很快就能见到妈妈啦
We're gonna see mommy in no time at all.

8
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:16,048
大家好 很抱歉孩子的吵闹给你们添堵
Hello there. I'm sorry for all of the noise.

9
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,183
艾瑞克森家的男人们今天颇为辛苦
It's been a long day for the Eriksen boys.

10
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,352
这押韵是怎么回事
Uh... What's with the rhyming?

11
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,720
这问题真是问得好
I'm glad that you ask.

12
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:24,690
哄我儿子睡觉可不好搞
To get my son sleeping is no easy task.

13
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,059
几周前 我老婆担起了重任
A few weeks ago, the job fell to my wife.

14
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:29,728
我儿子哭得让人心疼得很
And as the poor baby cried out for dear life,

15
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,965
她把每本童话书都试了一遍
She read every book, but all were no use

16
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:36,135
最终找到一位鹅妈妈才结束灾难
Until she arrived at a mother named goose.

17
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:36,135
{\a6}鹅妈妈童谣是一本英国民间童谣集

15
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:38,137
-为什么呢 马尔文  -她发现
-Why, marvin... -She noted.

18
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:39,972
这些押韵让你恹恹欲睡
...These rhymes make you tired!

19
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:42,041
从此 小马尔文有了心水
And ever since then, all young marvin's required

20
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:44,309
只需这书有押韵 他便能安静熟睡
Is one book of rhymes, and to dream land he goes.

21
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,911
好啦 现在咱读什么呢
Now, what shall we read?

22
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:48,380
不好了 我把书落在那辆车上了
Oh, crap, I left his book in the car!

23
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:51,483
那可真衰
That blows.

这是什么狗屎运啊
What craptastic luck!

30
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:12,004
没了马尔文的押韵书 这趟旅程注定艰苦
Without marvin's rhyme book, this ride's gonna suck!

31
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:14,006
车上有谁带了本诗集吗
Does anyone here have some poetry maybe?

32
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,040
或者出个主意
Or any advice? 

33
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,742
有 别生娃就行了呀
Yeah! Don't have a baby!

34
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,612
要是不让小马尔文醒过来
I guess if I don't want young Marvin to wake up,

35
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,382
我只能自己把韵押起来
The rhymes will just have to be ones that I make up.

36
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:26,452
出口成章 七步成诗什么的都是我的菜
I'll whip up some poetry in seconds flat!

37
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:32,458
有了
Oh, I know!

38
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,993
这故事就叫莫斯比击球不长眼
This story's called Mosby at the bat!

39
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,935
泰德情路多料峭
The outlook wasn't brilliant for poor Ted's romantic life.

40
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:46,939
三十好几没人要
He was deep into his thirties, and yet, still he had no wife.

41
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:48,607
有天正把论文批
But then, one day whilst grading papers,

42
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,109
生活还让他不如意
Life sent him a whammy.

43
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,144
一个物理教授叫丽萨
A physics prof named Lisa

44
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:53,545
不久前刚到 来自迈阿密
Who'd just moved here from miami.

45
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:54,746
教授
Professor?

46
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,048
她面露羞涩之意
She asked timidly.

47
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,050
他答道 叫我泰德就行
He answered: Call me ted. Oh.

48
00:01:58,052 --> 00:01:59,384
希望没有打扰到你
I don't want to bother you.

49
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:00,886
-没事 请坐吧  -他说道
-Please, have a seat. -He said.

50
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:04,423
我教书时间不太长 希望有经验能给分享
I'm fairly new to teaching, and I'm looking for advice.

51
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:07,626
我每晚练习做讲座 有时还要练两场
Every night I practice giving lectures, sometimes twice.

52
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:12,097
每当我讲到磁力 呆滞目光遍全场
But when I teach magnetic force, I just see eyeballs glazing.

53
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:17,503
我问了一圈啥情况 大家都说你教得最棒
I asked around, and people say your lectures are amazing.

54
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:18,904
超级无敌屌炸棒
Which is really saying something,

55
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:20,939
毕竟你教的是建筑学嘛 无聊
Because, architecture? Yawn.

56
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,908
泰德想着
And ted thought...

57
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,144
是啊 就跟物理有多好玩一样
Psh, yeah, 'cause physics is so interesting.

58
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:26,512
接着说
Go on.

59
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,080
就是说你这么会教书
It's just that you're so skilled,

60
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:29,915
我现在还羽翼未丰
And I'm a relative beginner.

61
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:33,919
如果不麻烦的话 咱能一起吃顿饭可成
If it isn't too much trouble, can I take you out to dinner?

62
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:37,523
我希望能收获些技巧 不会耽误你太晚的
I'd love to get some pointers, and I shouldn't keep you late.

63
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,124
你怎么看呀
What do you say?

64
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,526
我怎么看呀
What do I say?

65
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:42,261
西区泰迪有约会啦
Teddy Westside's got a date!

66
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:44,196
-好啊  -我们欢呼道
-Hooray! -We cheered.

67
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,264
泰德不坐冷板凳了
Ted's off the bench!

68
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:46,765
咱家小子重回情场
Our boy's back in the game!

69
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,300
感谢上帝 离上次泰德和女人有约
Thank god, it's been a hundred years

70
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,668
得有一百年过去了吧
Since mosby scored a dame.

71
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,537
上次泰德看到胸部的时候
The last time he saw boobies was

72
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,938
就是在«名扬四海»里的试镜那场戏里了
The screen-test scene in Fame.

73
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,206
泰德前任女朋友
The last girl he dated,

74
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,108
名字好像是右手
I think "Righty" Was her name.

75
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,943
淡定 咱别过分激动
Hold it. Let's not all go crazy

76
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,811
别跟狂暴化了似的
Like some wild berserkers.

77
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:02,648
如果这只是两个同事一起吃顿饭呢
What if this is just a business meal between co-workers?

78
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,683
泰德想起来以前几次失败的约会
Ted thought back on past failed dates.

79
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,818
天呐 他说得对
Oh, god, that could be true.

80
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,022
有多少次我带着失望的蛋蛋回家睡
How many times have I come home to find my balls are blue?

81
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:13,192
这全取决于泰德和他那位
It all depends where Ted and his new fetching young Floridian

82
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:16,061
佛州女士在那条线上的站位
Are standing in relation to that puzzling meridian

83
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:18,063
国际约会线
Called "The international date line."

84
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,565
你没听错 新学说
That's right, new theory.

85
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,633
-你们问 "那是什么"  -没人问
-"What's that," You ask? -Nobody did.

86
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,136
我就大发慈悲的告诉你们 约会线
I'll now address your query! The date line

87
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:27,306
也就是欢乐与悲伤的分界
Is the border betwixt happiness and sorrow.

88
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,575
要是在这里 你今晚就回家
On this side, you go home tonight.

89
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:32,578
要是这里 你就在外过夜
On this side, home tomorrow.

90
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,148
然后 巴尼做的手势太粗鲁
And then, as Barney made some gestures that were rather rude,

91
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,084
泰德离去寻丽萨 心中疑惑止不住
Ted left to go meet Lisa, in a rather puzzled mood.

92
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,019
这算个约会吗
Was this a date?

93
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,888
他不知道自己将要面对什么考验
He simply couldn't tell how he was faring.

94
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,022
然后丽萨出现
Then Lisa showed up.

95
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:47,526
泰德很高兴看到她衣着惊艳
Ted rejoiced to see what she was wearing.

96
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,927
因为要是出席工作晚餐
For girls at business dinners

97
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:51,063
女人们不会把事业线开那么低
Don't have necklines that revealing!

98
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,370
但是一个友好的握手让泰德
But then a friendly handshake gave poor Ted

99
00:03:58,372 --> 00:03:59,972
心情跌到谷底
A sinking feeling.

100
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,011
于是 晚餐开始了
And so, the night were on.

101
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:08,247
然后这个球就这么转啊转啊转
And back and forth, the globe rotated.

102
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:11,917
泰德的好奇心就这么晃啊晃啊晃
But still, Ted's curiosity was never fully sated.

103
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,385
什么时候是个头
How long could this continue?

104
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,254
他简直就是命运的棋子
He was truly fortune's pawn.

105
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:17,256
然后丽萨看到了电视
Then Lisa saw the tv.

106
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:18,890
嘿 洋基队的比赛开始
Hey, the yankees game is on!

107
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,592
-关于棒球  -泰德眼尖注意到
-Of baseball... -Ted observed...

108
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,528
美人似乎颇有料 一手资料皆通晓
...You seem to have some firsthand knowledge.

109
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,197
美女微笑耸肩道
To which the lady shrugged and said...

110
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,765
大学时光多荣耀 垒球娇娃姐之号
I played softball in college.

111
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,470
垒球不过陈腔调 不过如此无夸耀
Now the age-old softball stereotype's just that,

112
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,105
无夸耀
And nothing more.

113
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,606
-漂亮  -洋基跑垒草上飞
Yeah! But as the yankees got a run,

114
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,808
泰德心忧难上垒
Ted feared he wouldn't score.

115
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,577
一朝踏入分界线
For while the date side of the line's

116
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,812
插翅难飞泰德怨
The one we all might guess he's in,

117
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,448
美女投球好手段 小泰无力难称愿
There'll be no joy in tedville if our lisa is a...

118
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,083
漂亮 赢了耶
Yes! We win!

119
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,419
丽萨小酌 轻言道
Then lisa took a drink and said...

120
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,488
此事言及颇轻佻
This may sound kind of random,

121
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,157
小女恋球有蹊跷 若问奴家痴为何
But there actually is a reason for my rabid yankee fandom.

122
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,126
听我一片冰心玉壶道
I guess I'll just be honest here,

123
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,961
座上看官莫讥诮
Though crazy it may seem.

124
00:04:55,963 --> 00:05:00,165
初到宝地事难料 队中一人共春宵
My first week in new york, I dated someone on the team.

125
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,400
队里的谁
Which player?

126
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,934
-人家才不说  -说嘛
-I'm not saying.  -Please?

127
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,403
干嘛八卦 你是记者啊
What are you, a reporter?

128
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,971
泰德心绪飘天边
Ted's mind began to race.

129
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,606
恰逢小二来拿单
The waiter came to take their order.

130
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,007
丽萨朱唇轻启动
As lisa said...

131
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,976
大快朵颐奴不愿 只求意大利式海鲜面
I might like the spaghetti marinara.

132
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,511
可怜泰德心难平 此面莫非另有名
Poor ted just wondered silently...

133
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:15,113
洋基队版加藤鹰
Mariano rivera?

134
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:15,113
{\a6}马里安诺•李维拉 洋基队的王牌终结者 获奖无数
加藤鹰 最有名的岛国动作大片男星

135
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,114
美人此时话未终
And as she said...

136
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,283
此店美味有风评 意式炸鸡传美名
I read this place has great chicken milano.

137
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,519
言者此语无它意 听者闻言有别心 
All ted could bring himself to think was:

138
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,454
阿方索•索里阿诺
Alfonso soriano?

139
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,454
{\a6}阿方索•索里阿诺 洋基队左外野手

140
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:23,989
等闲小食难填我
I want something hearty.

141
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,291
碳烤味噌鳕鱼又如何
How about blackened miso cod?

142
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,526
是乔•吉拉迪吗
Is it joe girardi?

143
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,526
{\a6}乔·吉拉迪 扬基队主教练

144
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,995
我的神啊 是强棒罗德里格斯吗
Holy crap, is it a-rod?!

145
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,995
{\a6}罗德里格斯 全垒打王 曾因与麦当娜有染而天价离婚

146
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,596
好吧 泰德 冷静下来
Okay, ted, calm down.

147
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,131
打起精神来
You've got to get yourself together.

148
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,866
微笑 耍帅
Just smile, be charming,

149
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,035
教授气场 闲淡扯起来
Ooze charisma, talk about the weather.

150
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,503
这个可能是约会呦
For this might be a date,

151
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,772
所以还是有可能偷个情
Which means there might be hanky-panky.

152
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:44,109
所以老兄 千万一定 冷静 千万不要...
So, dude, be cool, relax, don't even...

153
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,844
快告诉我是哪个货
Just tell me which yankee!

154
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,448
我本来不想说起这个的
I'd rather not discuss this here.

155
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,283
不过既然这样 我也不希望会
But then again, I'd hate...

156
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:54,353
是这个傻傻的秘密毁了这个约会
To let a silly secret ruin such a lovely date.

157
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:57,022
既然没什么好回避的
If there's an elephant in the room

158
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,056
我干脆告诉你得了
Why don't we just remove it?

159
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,391
德瑞克•基特
I dated derek jeter.

160
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,391
{\a6}德瑞克•基特 纽约洋基队队长

161
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:00,992
有图可作证的
Here's a picture that'll prove it.

162
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,228
泰德小眼屏幕瞟 事出反常必有妖
As ted looked at that cell phone pic,

163
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,996
大石两块落心底
There were two things he reckoned.

164
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,998
确为约会能有炮
This definitely was a date,

165
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,568
此女却非常人消
But there wouldn't be a second.

166
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,870
睁眼看 效果显
See? It worked.

167
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,905
老爸押韵词款款 送我小宝梦甜甜
I said some rhymes, and out my boy did conk.

168
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,241
路漫漫 心安安
Now let's enjoy the ride.

169
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,044
会开车不 傻逼
Move, jackass!

170
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,552
可悲峰转又路回 重做新词再入睡
Okay, I need a brand-new tale to silence marvin's chatter.

171
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,555
才送清风歌一曲 轻渡舟楫君难为
I don't know, that last one had some sketchy subject matter.

172
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,692
言直情真君莫怪 吞云吐雾实不该
Forgive me, but before you got here, did you smoke a joint?

173
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:36,061
淼淼烟熏儿难耐
You don't tell kids a tale that crass!

174
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,496
老爸手指轻点赞
I guess he had a point.

175
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,731
老父此事也了然
I know, I said some things that were,

176
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,867
如君语 狭媚之事不宜言
As you say, kind of questionable.

177
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,935
肺腑之言 马文是小男
The truth is, children marvin's age

178
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,737
尚且年幼记忆浅
Aren't really that impressionable.

179
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,173
如你我 也枉然
Do you remember anything from when you were this small?

180
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:51,276
小时多健忘 唯不忘相思 恰如我小时 唯记南瓜拾
Pumpkin picking at age three is the first thing I recall.

181
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,611
嗯哼
Hmm. Huh.

182
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,912
此时确难记 我同意
He won't remember this. I guess it's true.

183
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,180
如我心意
It better be.

184
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,448
否则他日需求医 
Or else we'll end up paying

185
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,083
有道是 多花米
Through the nose for marvin's therapy.

186
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,952
你我二人多戏谑 在下周公尚有约
Okay, buddy, nice chat, but I think I need a break.

187
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:01,920
正解
Great idea.

188
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,055
此事尚未完
After this story!

189
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,757
罗宾蛋糕盘
Robin takes the cake.

190
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,098
吃相略难堪
Once in an east side bakery,

191
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,101
众人围观围一团
Your debonair aunt robin was making other customers think,

192
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,103
谁家有女难嫁汉
"Geez, who let this slob in?"

193
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,039
云淡风轻爱看看 罗宾猛塞才不管
She didn't care about their stares, or who was looking on.

194
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,474
落花流水谁无意
She'd just broke up with...

195
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:23,742
凯文
Kevin.

196
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:26,211
不对 是盖尔 还是史酷比
No, gael. Or scooby?

197
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,147
还是唐
Don?

198
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,949
若说罗宾吃相赞
Now, sometimes,

199
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,284
遥看瀑布挂前川
When it rains it pours,

200
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,618
已惊岩下雪如尘
And sometimes, it starts snowing,

201
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,121
大珠小珠落玉盘
For as cream filling hit her shirt...

202
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,556
好久不见
Hey, robin, how's it going?

203
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,491
罗宾抬头定睛看 正是西蒙混帐男
'twas simon, her ex-boyfriend

204
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,960
此君来自加拿大 青梅竹马有前缘
From her younger days in canada,

205
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,495
士别三日刮目看 此刻西蒙
But now, he looked quite different...

206
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:46,097
呃
Um...

207
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,332
押韵
Rhyme.

208
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,935
呃 我想想
Uh... Thinking. Uh...

209
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:52,337
刚刚我文思泉涌停不下来啊
I've just been handed a news flash.

210
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,939
"加拿大"这个词不押韵啊
The word "Canada" is unrhymeable.

211
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,574
随便说上一句话
It's easier to-- I don't know--

212
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,509
喝醉酒骑头牛都比押韵简单啊
get drunk and try to climb a bull.

213
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,978
但是加拿大 哎呀 芸芸众生你随便问吧
But canada, damn it, ask any man on the planet

214
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,313
你且看他结结巴巴
and watch their stammerin' stamina

215
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:04,015
想方设法把"加拿大"塞进他的话
as they clamor and cram it into the middle of a sentence.

216
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,517
但他就是不得其法
For a shot at repentance,

217
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,953
再悔恨也没办法 只能将此难题留给后人解答
pass the problem on to all their non-rhyming descendants.

218
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:10,255
我至今都没见过谁能把韵脚押上"加拿大"
I've never met anyone who could clean up after Canada,

219
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,090
但我那家住布朗克斯的叔叔托尼做到啦
except my uncle tony from the bronx.

220
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,091
他只是个门卫哪
He's a janitor.

221
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,998
臭显摆
Show-off.

222
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
西蒙 见到你真高兴
Simon. Nice to see you.

223
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,135
你来纽约干嘛啊
So, what brings you to New York?

224
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,537
-我搬到纽约来了  -是吗 真的啊
-I live here now. -What? Really?

225
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,005
-是呢  -真好
-Yeah. -That's great.

226
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,640
能给我把叉子吗
Can I get a fork?

227
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,141
尽管西蒙终日游手好闲
He'd always been a deadbeat

228
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,877
不修边幅 说话办事不着边
and your classic hoser phony.

229
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,846
可罗宾眼见今日的西蒙衣着光鲜不似从前 心中顿生许多愁念
But seeing simon all cleaned up hit robin like a zamboni.

230
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,015
她将他仔仔细细上下打量
And as she looked him up and down,

231
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,350
罗宾年轻的心不禁一阵悲伤
young robin felt a tingle.

232
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,185
西蒙是否终于脱胎换骨
Had simon blossomed finally?

233
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,120
若果真如此 我和他又能否将破镜修补
And if so, was he single?

234
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,722
真是太好了
So great.

235
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,991
她柔声细语身姿婀娜 媚眼狂送秋波
She purred, whilst batting her eyelashes like a flooze.

236
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,126
是很好 我跟露易丝•马什订婚了
Yup, I'm engaged to Louise Marsh,

237
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,995
我们家里有超豪华按摩浴缸呢
and our pad's got a jacuzz!

238
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:52,197
糕点店瞬间天旋地转 罗宾好似走在云端
The bakery spinned, the floor dropped out.

239
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,965
空气都被冻结 充满不安
The air was thick as syrup.

240
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,967
罗宾只觉头晕目眩 呼吸困难
Poor robin swooned, she couldn't breathe.

241
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,836
泪水即将决堤
Her eyes began to tear up.

242
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,838
正当她欲鼓起勇气逃离此地
And as she tried to stammer some excuse

243
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,573
西蒙一语 让她跌到谷底
to get away, simon said:

244
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:04,042
我们的结婚蛋糕是不是超级牛逼
Our wedding cake is pretty bitchin', eh?

245
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,479
此时 罗宾心中腾升起无限恨意
And so was born the worst idea poor robin's ever had.

246
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:10,015
门扉轻叩 泰德应门
And on ted's door there came a rapping.

247
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,083
我干了件非常不好的事
I did something bad.

248
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,685
罗宾将事件原委一一道来
As robin told her tale,

249
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,820
泰德便知 她犯了何等严重的错误
Ted knew she'd made a massive boo-boo,

250
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:20,025
因为偷拿别人的结婚蛋糕是多么地无可饶恕
for stealing someone's wedding cake is terribly bad juju.

251
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:22,527
罗宾 你变成现在这样 我真是看不下去
Robin, I'm beside myself to see what you've become!

252
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,396
你必须马上把蛋糕还回去
You must return this cake at once!

253
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,397
-我做不到  -怎么做不到
-I can't! -Why not?

254
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,765
因为...
'cause...

255
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,233
好吃
Yum.

256
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:32,370
泰德无语叹息 他从未见过比这更恶毒的行为
Ted gasped, for he had never seen a brazen act so vicious.

257
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,172
罗宾虽然懊悔 但是...
Robin felt remorse, and yet...

258
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,341
我的天 太好吃了我停不下嘴
Oh, god, this is delicious!

259
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:40,045
于是一生二 二生三 三生无穷 罗宾已经吃了17口蛋糕
So one piece led to two, then three, then five, then 17.

260
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:44,182
她就像只饥肠辘辘的狼人 蛋糕在她口里被瓦解掉
She savaged that poor cake like some rapacious wolverine.

261
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,185
她吃 她吞 她咬 她嚼 一个疯狂的晚上就此来到
Eating, gobbling, munching, so the frenzied night wore on.

262
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,087
妈妈尚未赶到
And by the time your mom arrived,

263
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,022
已经没了一半蛋糕
the cake was halfway gone.

264
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,724
我收到消息立刻就过来了
I came as soon as I got word.

265
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,526
情况有多糟糕
So how bad is the damage?

266
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:58,730
你自己看吧 她正在上演"疯狂的食道"
See for yourself the product of her cake-in-gullet crammage!

267
00:09:58,732 --> 00:09:59,931
我已经吃了半个蛋糕了吗
Half a cake?

268
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,399
我都干了什么啊
What have I done?!

269
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:03,568
我的行为不会被世人原谅
The world shall not forgive it!

270
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,236
这罪恶的一天将永远留在耻辱柱上
This day will live in infamy.

271
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,472
我一生都不能摆脱这个罪状
I never shall outlive it!

272
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,974
我已堕落至此
For I have become

273
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:12,077
我化悲愤为食量 一口一口吃掉忧伤
the girl that eats her feelings, don't mistake it.

274
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,246
在我坐坏这把椅子之前 我最好还是立刻离场
I think I need to get out of this chair before I break it.

275
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,949
瞎说 瞎想 别乱讲
Nonsense! Hogwash! Balderdash!

276
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,618
你妈妈的热心一如既往
Said mommy, with great fervor.

277
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,420
你不能现在停下 难道你不明白吗
You can't stop now, for don't you see?

278
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:26,257
对不知情的人来讲 你并非什么青春疼痛文学里
To the uninformed observer, you're not some sad cliche,

279
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:29,461
满心伤痛的怨女
some loser from a chick-lit story.

280
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:33,164
你是罗宾 吃完剩下的半个蛋糕 荣誉就属于你
You're robin, and you're half a wedding cake away from glory!

281
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,001
你要是现在停下 那西蒙就是赢家
If you quit now, then simon wins.

282
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,069
而故事的结局就是
The tale comes to a stop

283
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,605
罗宾偶遇旧爱 惊慌失措
at how you saw an ex, freaked out,

284
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,273
还偷了糕点 犯下过错
and robbed a pastry shop.

285
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,943
你要是狠狠心 亲爱的
If you have the guts, my dear,

286
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:47,078
现在就是时候火力全开
it's time to get empowered

287
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,280
把蛋糕吃光
and be remembered for this

288
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:52,117
让你的英名千古流芳
sweet behemoth you devoured.

289
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,184
多年以后
And years from now,

290
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,187
游吟诗人会为你作诗吟唱
the troubadour will raise his voice and sing

291
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:59,124
歌颂罗宾是如何偷拿蛋糕
of the time that robin took the cake.

292
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:00,992
并且把这东西
and ate the whole...

293
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,293
吃了个
damned...

294
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,962
精光
thing.

295
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,431
罗宾再一次深深深呼吸
Once more into the breach she surged,

296
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,033
泰德和妈妈给她加油打气
as ted and mommy cheered

297
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:11,970
一口又一口 那罪恶的蛋糕塔 高度越来越低
and bite by bite the towering confection disappeared.

298
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:13,705
有朋自远方来目睹这场战役
Some friends were called to come and watch.

299
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,206
无人需要多做努力
And no one had to beg,

300
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,541
吃蛋糕派对的声名便远播千里
it soon became a party.

301
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,610
巴尼甚至搬来了一桶酒 此乃助兴神器
Barney even got a keg.

302
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:21,713
左一叉右一勺 罗宾狂吃法式香草
Forkful after forkful, Robin guzzled french vanilla,

303
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,149
那动静简直就像是猩猩般狂躁
making noises not unlike those made by a gorilla.

304
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,017
加油啊 罗宾 吃了它
Come on, Robin, finish it.

305
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,687
你妈妈的谆谆教诲回荡在罗宾的耳旁
Mom's exhortations rang

306
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:32,223
就像阿波罗在洛基对战克鲁伯•朗时一直在旁指导一样
like Apollo coaching Rocky 'gainst a frosted clubber lang.

307
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,958
啊 «洛基4» 我的最爱
Oh, Rocky iv, my favorite.

308
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,527
不对 第四部是跟俄国人打的
No, no, iv is with the russians.

309
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,362
不对 第四部是洛基因为脑震荡
No, iv's the one where he talks weird

310
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,997
整个人说话都怪怪的
because of his concussions.

311
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,331
-他好像在每部电影里都那样  -打住
-I think that's all of them. -Hey now,

312
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,168
不要争了 就是第四部
no need to be discordant. It's rocky iv.

313
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,903
-不 是第三部  -错 是第二部
-No, iii. -No, ii.

314
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,871
管它哪部不哪部
It's really not important.

315
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,642
最后时分人共鉴 最后一块举嘴边
At last young Robin raised the final bite up to her lips.

316
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,043
人群顿时寂无言
The crowd grew still.

317
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,547
只闻巴尼吃薯片
The only sound was barney eating chips.

318
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,050
蛋糕剩最后一口
Just one bite left.

319
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,053
这一幕就如«铁窗喋血»中的硬汉老卢
Hey, this is like that scene from cool hand luke. 

320
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,089
五十鸡蛋轻轻松松吃下肚  
You know, "My boy can eat 50 eggs." Right?

321
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,924
分分钟都要吐
She's gonna puke.

322
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,226
但罗宾没有吐
But robin did not puke.

323
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,361
她吃完那口直立而起 面带骄傲
She ate that bite and stood up, proud.

324
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:16,034
等下 我还没完呢
Wait. I'm not done yet.

325
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,869
对着惊魂未定的人群 大声嘶喊道
She shouted, to the startled crowd.

326
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,671
我秒杀了这个婚礼蛋糕
I've bested this here wedding cake.

327
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,372
我非常乐意获此荣耀
I'll gladly wear that crown.

328
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:22,540
既然挑战已经做到
But now that I have done that task,

329
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,076
那也是时候将它冲刷掉
It's time to wash it down.

330
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,178
今晚实在太美好
For it's been such an awesome night,

331
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,748
只有一个办法画上句号
There's just one way to cap it.

332
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,016
我要把这桶酒全都喝掉
I'm going to drink this entire keg.

333
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,019
巴尼 把酒开好
Okay, barney, tap it.

334
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,187
哦 哇噢
Oh! Wow.

335
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,125
嘿咻 嘿咻
Hup. Ho-o, oh.

336
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:43,595
当晚大家记住的 不再是罗宾被抛弃
And now that night's remembered not for robin getting dumped

337
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,831
而是我们送她去洗胃的记忆
But as the night we took her in to get her stomach pumped.

338
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,033
快看啊
And look at that,

339
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,436
小天使睡过去了 大家
The little angel's sleeping soundly, gus.

340
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,971
看起来我们的问题像是...
Looks like our problems...

341
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:53,972
别一车占俩道
Pick a lane!

342
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:58,643
我恨这巴士恨到家
I hate this stupid bus.

343
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,716
马尔文 恐怕今晚要彻底沦陷
Marvin, I'm afraid this night is not much of a winner.

344
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:08,453
我们堵在半路 还得错过整个预演晚宴
Stuck in traffic, now we've missed the whole rehearsal dinner.

345
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,422
我希望我是对的 你对这段事情没有记忆
I pray that I was right and that you'll have no memory

346
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:14,659
{\a6}LIE即Long Island Expressway 

347
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:14,659
地狱般的长岛高速乘车记
Of this godforsaken ride down the congested LIE.

348
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,795
至少有一点我能肯定
At least we know one thing for sure:

349
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,496
今天也不可能更倒霉了吧 想必
Things can't get worse, I swear.

350
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:21,099
永别了 堵死马桶的卷饼 爽啊
Adios, truck stop burrito. Ooh!

351
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,734
洗手间别去
Do not go in there.

352
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:26,905
好吧 再给你说一个 我试着好好讲
Okay, one more story, and I'll try to tell it pretty.

353
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,940
巴尼•斯丁森的传说
The tale of barney stinson,

354
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,042
纽约城花花公子之大帝
Player king of new york city.

355
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,350
很久以前 我们去酒吧怡情小酌
Once upon a time, we all went out to get our drink on.

356
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,085
此时进来了一个女孩
When who should walk in but a girl

357
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,488
粉色毛衣紧身惹火
With sweater tight and pink on.

358
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,689
她点了一杯啤酒
She ordered up a beer.

359
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,491
想必你也已经知道结局
I think you see where this is going.

360
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,693
如同巴尼意味深长的一句
As barney put it, oh so eloquently:

361
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,528
遇玉欲御
Boy-oy-oy-oing.

362
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,965
他起身走向女孩准备下手
He rose to go approach this girl commanding such intrigue

363
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,466
你妈妈突然打断说
When mommy interrupted:

364
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,635
哥们 你完全不是她的对手
Dude, she's way out of your league.

365
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:01,539
{\a6}美国Hooters餐厅 小孩子去了一定把持不住

366
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:01,539
她没穿小热裤 也没套挤胸衣
She's not in daisy dukes, nor squeezed into a hooters tee.

367
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:05,043
而且她钥匙链上也没挂什么健身VIP
And I don't see a curves membership dangling from her key.

368
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,144
她不用古铜喷雾
She has no glaring spray tan,

369
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:09,514
也没纹独角兽
no unicorn tattoos.

370
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:13,718
她在品啜夏敦埃 没在猛灌樱桃味酒
She's sipping chardonnay, not pounding cherry-flavored booze.

371
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,721
她没花枝招展 也没在拨弄头发
Her makeup isn't running, she's not playing with her hair.

372
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,824
她几乎不可能让你把那家伙放进那
There's very little chance she'll let you put it anywhere.

373
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,893
我接受你的挑战 莉莉
Your challenge is accepted, lil.

374
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,895
不存在小妞太过漂亮
There is no girl too pretty,

375
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,864
因为我是巴尼•斯丁森
For I am barney stinson,

376
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,166
纽约城花花公子之大帝
Player king of new york city.

377
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:30,635
你不能自封为帝
You can't anoint yourself the king,

378
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,570
就像那个混蛋 勒布朗
Just like that jerk, lebron.

379
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,839
他都离开骑士队三年了
He left the cavs three years ago.

380
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,507
兄弟 放下吧 忘掉过往
Bro, give it up, move on.

381
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:39,143
所以 为什么我是大帝 问得好
So why am I king? Glad you asked.

382
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,011
-我们没有  -从没问过
-We didn't. -Never do.

383
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,146
我要讲述这一切的源头
It's origin story time.

384
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,849
相信我 字字是真不会错
And trust me, every word is true.

385
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:48,186
很早之前的清晨 我从一个猎物身边醒来
One morning long ago, I woke up next to a conquest.

386
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,421
如此多的闪光 她的咪咪
So many great things 'bout this girl: Her boobs,

387
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,091
她的胸部 她的大奶
Her rack, her chest.

388
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,893
她饥渴难耐
She had a thirst for action,

389
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,995
年轻的巴尼填满了她欲壑
And young Barney was a-quenchin' it.

390
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,196
这和剧情有关吗
Is this important to the story?

391
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,098
没啊 顺便一提图个乐
No, just thought I'd mention it.

392
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,434
当我甩掉大波辣妹 正要离开
As I departed, having bid this busty babe buh-bye,

393
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,403
我驻足观望 不禁疑惑起来
I stopped and looked around, and wondered:

394
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,000
妈现在在哪儿
Where the hell am I?

395
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,407
路牌写着22街 疑惑瞬间拜拜
The sign read 22nd street, and my concern decreased

396
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:13,912
直到阴风将树枝吹向一旁 露出"东"字牌
Until a cold wind blew a branch aside, Revealing: "East."

397
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,247
在东边 不要啊
The east side. No.

398
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,582
我都做了些什么
Wh-what have I done?

399
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,950
我结结巴巴的说着
I stammered with chagrin.

400
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:20,852
接下来一个黑色的轿车停在我面前 
Just then a black sedan pulled up...

401
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,420
-你是巴尼  -是
-You barney? -Yeah.

402
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,055
上车
Get in.

403
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,223
有一句真的吗
Is any of this true?

404
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,393
当然 现在 坐稳了朋友们
Of course. Now, hang on to your "Chayers."

405
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,929
那一天我被召至
For that day I was called before...

406
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,398
花花公子最高议会

先生们 十分感谢大家的出席
Gentlemen, for your attendance here, our deepest thanks.

408
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:40,972
我很遗憾地说 议会的队伍中混入了偷猎者的踪迹
I'm sad to say, this council has a poacher in its ranks.

409
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,573
这位巴尼
For barney here

410

411
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:45,810
东区
The east side

412
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,412
是燕尾服查理的领地
Is tuxedo charlie's turf.

413
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:48,579
他生气了呢
He's mad.

414
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,114
真实的故事
True story.

415
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:53,551
2004年的协议清楚地规定
The agreement of 2004 quite clearly did define

416
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,621
第五大道是我们猎场的分界线
Fifth avenue to be our hunting grounds' dividing line.

417
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:01,059
你西区里的学生妹我毫不染指
Your west side college girls are not the slip I park my boat in.

418
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,460
所以你应当知道
So you should know

419
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:06,397
我东区里初涉世事的少女对你严格禁止
My east side debutantes are quite verboten.

420
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,499
议会成员们

421
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,169
兄弟们... 谁都不希望硝烟四起

422
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:14,339
我当然没有忘记04年的协议
Of course I've not forgotten the agreement of '04.

423
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,107
但我能说什么呢 一次失足而已
What can I say? A bonehead move.

424
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,976
为此申辩吗 我无能为力
Defend it? I'm not able.

425
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,345
但是 兄弟们 我难道没有
But, bros, have I not been a bro

426
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:22,113
对在座的各位兄弟尽忠尽力
To each bro at this table?

427
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,115
我来自布鲁克林的小伙伴 泡菜坛•鲍勃
My friend from brooklyn, pickle jar bob,

428
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,084

429
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,151
记得那个年轻的游客吗

430
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,821
寻找宾州车站的那一位
Who was looking for penn station?

431
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,590
她刚从波士顿前来 拥有魔鬼般的身材
She'd just come in from boston, had a wicked good-in-bed look.

432
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:36,594
{\a6}红钩 位于纽约布鲁克林 

433
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:36,594
我给她错误的指引 让她走向了红钩地带
I gave her bad directions and she ended up in Red Hook.

434
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,463
-闭嘴 巴尼  -悠着点 布朗克斯•多尼
-Shut up, barney. -Whoa, bronx donnie,

435
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,131
咱们不要激动着急
Let's not get excited.

436
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:43,501
燕尾服查理不是这里唯一一枚受害者
Tuxedo charlie's not the only one here who's been slighted.

437
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,971
你告诉她你是基特 好将她诱至你的床第
You told her you were Jeter in your quest to lie upon her.

438
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,971
{\a6}德瑞克•基特 美国职棒大联盟选手 纽约洋基队队长

439
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:49,507
假扮洋基队员是我的专利
Impersonating yankees is my thing.

440
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,142
你难道没有一点信誉
Have you no honor?

441
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,177
先生们 请安静 咱们不要把
Gentlemen, please, let's not blow

442
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,046
这缓和的关系弃之谷底

在我那从61街和伍德赛德启程的漫长地铁里
And on my long-ass subway ride from 61st and Woodside,

451
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:13,031
我想到了让大家和睦相处的妙计
I came up with a plan to keep you on each other's good side.

452
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,366
巴尼 你委屈了这两位兄弟

453
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,834
对于这个他们快输了的游戏
So, for the game they're losing,

454
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,970
你必须为其每人提供

455
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:21,472
一个他们喜欢的西区美女
A west side hottie of their choosing.

456
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:22,540
开什么玩笑你
You're kidding.

457
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,908
这就是最后决议
That's the settlement?

458
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,277
别这样 这也太过傻比
Come on, that's rather silly. 

459
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,045
先生们 你们怎么说

搞笑呢 布朗克斯•多尼
Please. Bronx donnie?

463
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,317
想与我同床根本没戏
No chance he could get me in the sack.

464
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,187
告诉那个黑手党 有地儿让他抽人去
Tell that mafioso I know something he can whack.

465
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,755

你们的淑女之腿可放心紧闭

469
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,198
看样子我多说无益
It seems there's nothing I can say to sway you.

470
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,666
查理 多尼

卡洛塔 上香槟

你的小故事戳中了我们的笑点
Your little story tickled all our ribs.

485
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,052
但你犯了一个错误 先生
But one mistake you made, sir,

486
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:43,454
那就是忘了预定在先
Was forgetting to call dibs.

487
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,556
不 这不公平
No! Not fair.

488
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,291
我才是玩家大帝
But I'm the king.

489
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,927
-打扮也帅得多  -不好意思啊兄弟

492
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,934
再喝一轮吧
Let's have another round.

493
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,102
你妈妈说道
Your mommy said.

494
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,904
我们又喝了几许
And so we had one.

495
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:01,739
夜晚还在继续 我必须要说
The night wore on, and I must say,

496
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,774
这是个不错的经历
It wasn't a half bad one.

497

如此的回忆 我们年轻快乐的心

499
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,816
那些日子仿佛发生在上个世纪
Feels like a lifetime since those days.

500
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,620
抱歉同志们
Sorry, folks,

501
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,021
爆胎了
Flat tire.

502
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,589
哦 别这样啊
oh, come on.

503
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,958
这下我再也到不了南塔克特岛了
Now I'm never gonna make it to nantucket.

504
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,868
看 烟花在空中绽放
Oh, look a fireworks display.

505
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,303
小火箭发出耀眼红光
Some rockets red glare action.

506
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,671
谢天谢地
Thank god.

507
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:37,175
我还以为是我青光眼滴眼液的作用呢
Thought my glaucoma drops were causing a reaction.

508
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:41,279
马尔文 抱歉整个旅行像屎一样
Marvin, I'm so sorry this whole journey's been a bummer.

509
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:46,517
很快你就能回到妈咪的怀抱 温暖如夏日阳光
Soon you'll be right back in mommy's arms, as warm as summer.

510
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,987
不幸的是 当我们登记入住酒店的那刻开始
But sadly while your troubles stop once we get to the inn

511
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:53,357
你的烦恼烟消云散 而我的麻烦却刚刚开场
The moment we arrive is when my troubles will begin.

512
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,893
有时爸爸做事荒唐
Sometimes daddies screw up,

513
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,729
有时妈妈脾气暴涨
Sometimes mommies get upset.

514
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:02,166
但我真心希望这个周末的记忆 能让你快快遗忘
I really hope this weekend is a memory you'll forget.

515
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:05,870
快抬起头吧 看看烟花绽放 余烬飞扬
So look up at those fireworks, enjoy the falling embers...

516
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:12,610
孩子们 这就是你们马尔文哥哥记忆中的第一件事
And that, kids, is the very first thing your cousin marvin remembers.

517
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,883
女士们先生们 还有一个小时...
Gentlemen and ladies, it'll be an hour or so...

518
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:22,520
卡车就能来到这儿牵引大巴了
before the truck gets here to give our broken bus a tow.

519
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:26,090
与此同时呢 我们还是轻松惬意点吧
So in the meantime I suggest we all get nice and cozy.

520
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,659
我们还得在这待会儿
We're gonna be here for a while.

521
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,830
{\a6}英语儿歌 同时也是一种儿童玩的游戏

522
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,830
围着玫瑰绕圈圈吗
Uh, ring-around-the-rosy?

523
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,865
好啊
Yeah!

524
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:38,002
你觉得这儿离远汉普顿旅馆有多远呢
How far do you suppose it is to the farhampton inn?

525
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,004
我觉得还有五英里吧
I'd say about five miles away.

526
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,872
不要啊
Oh, no.

527
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,441
你奸笑是什么意思呢
What's with the grin?

528
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,409
然后马修仰望天空
Then Marshall looked up heavenward,

529
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,445
以夜空中第一颗星为名庄严发誓
And swore by night's first star

530
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,847
说出了他马上就会后悔的五个字
Five simple words he'd soon regret:

531
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,915
我能走到那
I can walk that far.

532
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:55,915
