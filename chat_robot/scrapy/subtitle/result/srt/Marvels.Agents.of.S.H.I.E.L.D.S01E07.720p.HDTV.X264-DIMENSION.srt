30
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:39,660
你先上
Go.

31
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,780
好
All right.

32
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,350
雪橇狗在哪
Um, where are the dogs?

33
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,960
别逗了  用不着
Don't be ridiculous.

34
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,130
通常情况下  我敢说是你拿着这种东西
I bet you're usually the one holding something like this.

35
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,970
别担心
Don't worry. 

36
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,530
她知道自己在干什么
She knows what she's doing.

37
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,830
不要呼吸哦
Whatever you do, don't breathe.

38
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,950
开玩笑啦
That was a joke.

39
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,610
你当然可以呼吸  如果你觉得需要的话
You should, of course, feel comfortable breathing if you need to,

40
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,890
别用鼻子就行
Just not through your nose.

41
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,970
用嘴呼吸也要幅度很小
And very minimally through your mouth.

42
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,430
拿到了
There we are.

43
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,790
这是你获取的所有情报吗
That's all the intel you recovered?

44
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,370
我当然希望是
I certainly hope so.

45
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,790
谢谢你  肖特工
Well, thank you, Agent Shaw,

46
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,510
安全地保管情报
for keeping it safe up there.

47
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,530
我们会把它送回中心
We'll push this through to the Hub.

48
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,660
事实上  我们正开往那里  把你留在那
In fact, we're headed there now to drop you off.

49
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,160
换套衣服  吃顿像样的饭
Get you a change of clothes, a proper meal --

50
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,530
你会马上调整好状态的
You'll be good as new.

51
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,180
中心  真的吗
The Hub? Really?

52
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,590
好激动  好久没去了
How exciting. It's been ages.

53
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,780
很好
Good.

54
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,900
鼻旁取出已经完成了
Done with that paranasal extraction nonsense.

55
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,950
你需要我来分析这数据吗
Do you need me to analyze the data?

56
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,800
不必
That won't be necessary.

57
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,950
如果加密了  我可以帮他搞定芯片
If it's encrypted, I can mine the chip for him.

58
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,040
恐怕这个任务是机密的
I'm afraid this mission's classified.

59
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,690
权限等级8
Clearance level 8.

60
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,890
等等  什么
Wait. What?

61
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,290
他一句话就可以让我们不闻不问吗
He can just shut us out of the process like that?

62
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,350
他说过任务是等级8了
Well, he did say the mission is level 8.

63
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,820
我们没那权限  所以我们没法知道
And we're not, so we can't know about it.

64
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,120
但这通常是
Right, but this is normally the part

65
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,340
我们围站在操作台前  获取情报的时候
where we all stand around the holocom and we learn about stuff.

66
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,350
我是说  我们是一伙儿的  不是吗
I mean, aren't we all on the same team?

67
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,990
用不着搞你那套社会主义理论了
No need to get started on one of your socialist riffs.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,160
神盾局的基础结构是基于等级制度
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s whole infrastructure is based on the hierarchy

69
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
和情报的等级划分
and compartmentalization of intelligence.

70
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,780
每个任务的情报不能让每个特工都知道
Every agent can't have the intel on every mission.

71
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,650
那会让整个组织变得很脆弱
Makes the entire organization vulnerable.

72
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,410
好吧  但是如果我刚从
Okay, fine, but if I just fought my way out

73
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,870
西伯利亚的地下监狱逃出
of an underground Siberian prison,

74
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,480
我会希望知道行动是为了什么
I'd kind of want to know what for.

75
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,220
科尔森让你习惯了飞机上的套路
Coulson's got you used to the plane,

76
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,710
我们在这里行动的方式
The way we do missions here.

77
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,830
中心的工作方式可完全不同
The Hub is different.

78
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,280
中心
The Hub?

79
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,540
中心是什么
What's the Hub?

80
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,620
{\an8}中心
地点: 机密

81
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,470
没想到大本营有这么大
Didn't realize big brother was this big.

82
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,680
这不算什么
Oh, this is nothing.

83
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,910
等你看到三叉戟总部时  那才叫大呢
wait until you see the Triskelion.

84
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,480
所有人都穿同样的服装
Everyone's wearing the same suit.

85
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,810
谁能告诉我为什么
Someone tell me why, please.

86
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,320
有我的吗
Do I get one?

87
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,440
那是你的"胸章"
That's your badge,

88
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,720
意味着你即便要想达到等级1  还有很长的路要走
which means you've got a long way to go to even make level one.

89
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,200
收到
Copy that.

90
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,550
这是不是意味着我不能用这里的任何一台电脑
Does that also mean no access to any computers here whatsoever?

91
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,170
我可以查神盾局关于我父母那个编辑过的档案
I could run a search on the redacted S.H.I.E.L.D. file on my parents.

92
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,270
斯凯
Skye. 

93
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,400
但...
But it just --

94
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,420
这里看起来就像是他们被关着的地方
It seems like the place they'd keep them, right?

95
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,510
我会调查的
I'll look into it.

96
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,310
但现在  我们手头上有更紧迫的事情
But right now, we've got more pressing matters at hand.

97
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,660
西特韦尔特工
Agent Sitwell.

98
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,780
科尔森特工
Agent Coulson.

99
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,420
很高兴看到你好转了
Good to see you feeling better.

100
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,500
汉德特工在局势分析室里等你
Agent Hand's waiting for you in the situation room.

101
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,590
她不太喜欢等人
And she doesn't like to wait.

102
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,550
你认识她吗
So you know her?

103
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,160
只是听说过
Only her reputation.

104
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,730
你先请
After you.

105
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,530
你的七级特工可以来简报室里一起听
Your level 7s can join us in the briefing.

106
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,090
笑一个
Say cheese.

107
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,380
维多利亚・汉德
Victoria Hand...

108
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,820
在这里
Is here.

109
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,990
你用这么精妙的方法告诉我不能跟过去吗
Is this your subtle way of saying I can't come with?

110
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,220
我们马上回来
We'll be back.

111
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,530
什
Wha--

112
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,970
我们应该去一下技术走廊了
We should probably head over to the tech corridor.

113
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,250
-我迫不及待想看新化学装备了  -是啊
- Oh, I can't wait to see the new chem-kit. -Yeah

114
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,040
这地方肯定不喜欢我
I don't think it likes me here.

115
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,700
汉德特工
Agent Hand.

116
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,150
科尔森特工
Agent Coulson.

117
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,980
很高兴终于见到你本人了
Nice to finally put a face to the name.

118
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,820
彼此彼此
Likewise.

119
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,640
这是梅特工和沃德特工
These are agents May and Ward.

120
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,090
介绍就到此为止吧
Well, now that we've gotten that over with,

121
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,690
这是你们所能掌握的情报
Here's what you can know.

122
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,760
你们从肖特工手上得到的情报
The intel you recovered from agent Shaw

123
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,820
告诉我们一个南奥塞梯的独立组织
tells us that a separatist group from South Ossetia

124
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,390
制造了一件叫做"艾斯比图米特"的武器
has built a weapon called Ezbiitometer.

125
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,720
是一种超强杀伤性装置吗
The overkill device?

126
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,040
以我的口味看  略显做作
A little dramatic for my taste.

127
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,520
我想可能是名字在翻译过程中遗漏了什么
I imagine something was lost in translation.

128
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,130
我们从拦截到的信号中得知
We've intercepted chatter that tells us

129
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,510
他们打算在接下来的24小时内靠这武器
they plan to use the weapon in the next 24 hours

130
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,350
宣布从俄罗斯和格鲁吉亚那里独立
to declare their independence from Russia and Georgia.

131
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,630
我们认为它会引起音波振动
We believe it creates sonic vibrations

132
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,690
其威力足以在远距离触发武器
Powerful enough to trigger weapons from a great distance --

133
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,090
从直升机上的导弹
Anything from the missiles on a helicopter

134
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,270
到发射井中的核弹头都能触发
To a nuclear warhead sitting in its silo.

135
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,670
所以如果我们对他们动武
So if we move on them,

136
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,780
他们就用我们的武器来对付我们
They could use our own weapons against us.

137
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,810
没错
Exactly.

138
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,610
所以我需要一支二人小队
That's why I need a two-man team

139
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,290
偷偷穿过争议边界
to sneak across the disputed border undetected,

140
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,050
闯进独立组织的要塞
break into the separatist stronghold,

141
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,470
在24小时内让这武器瘫痪
and disable the weapon in the next 24 hours.

142
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,760
而你正好有两个人适合这工作
And you have two people who fit my bill.

143
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,860
没问题
Not a problem.

144
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,170
我参与过08年的格鲁吉亚战争
I was in Georgia during the incursion in '08.

145
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,130
我现在仍与南奥塞梯的边境有联系
I still have contacts on the South Ossetian border.

146
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,330
你们到时必须要操作它们
And you'll have to use them.

147
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,060
但我们没有那仪器方面的专家
But we don't have specs on the device,

148
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,870
所以我需要你们团队中
so I need someone on the team

149
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,590
一个可以到现场识别出并拆除它的人
who can identify and dismantle it on-site.

150
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,040
你的意思是...
Do you mean...

151
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,660
我想就是那意思
I think she does.

152
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,380
我找到一个小范围电磁脉冲
I found a localized E.M.P.,

153
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,950
还有一些其他工具
plus a few other party favors.

154
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,980
拜托  这
Oh, come on. What the...

155
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,100
开门啊
Open.

156
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,490
卡住了
It's stuck!

157
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,330
小车被卡住了
The cart's stuck.

158
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
太难以置信了
That's unbelievable.

159
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,880
这什么情况啊
What the hell?!

160
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,260
谁设计的
Who designed this?!

161
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,300
在中心到处都是
In the hub, of all places.

162
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,470
这...
Oh, that's...

163
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,270
你没开玩笑吧
Seriously?

164
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,270
我只是无法想象你要参与
I just can't believe you're going in 

165
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,290
那里漆黑一片
dark,

166
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,950
又是敌方领土  不带通讯工具
in hostile territory, without comms,

167
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,300
而你手无缚鸡之力
lacking any real physical strength.

168
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,660
我不会有事的
I'll be fine.

169
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,220
抗蛇毒素我给你了吗
Did I give you an antivenin pack?

170
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,240
高加索有很多当地独有的蜘蛛物种
The caucasus have a plethora of highly endemic spider species.

171
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,620
珍玛  别  别再替我担心了
Jemma, stop. Stop worrying about me.

172
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,310
我没问题的
I can do this.

173
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,850
谢谢
Thank you.

174
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,490
我不在的时候你不要做什么傻事
And don't you do anything rash while I'm gone...

175
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,390
比如说从飞机上跳下去什么的
...like jump out of an airplane.

176
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,260
你要小心
Well, you'll be careful.

177
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,740
更糟糕的情况我都处理过
Yeah, I've handled worse.

178
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,700
差点忘了  我给你做了这个
Oh, I almost forgot. I made you this.

179
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,120
你最爱的三明治
Your favorite sandwich.

180
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,670
意式熏火腿加水牛芝士
Prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella.

181
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,030
加你自制的蒜泥蛋黄酱了吗
With your homemade pesto aioli?

182
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,480
加了一点
Just a hint.

183
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,400
你要的是这个吗
Hey, is this what you wanted?

184
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,800
还有  这是什么
Also, what is this?

185
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,360
菲兹
Oh, Fitz.

186
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,010
全尺寸的弹匣袋
A full-sized mag pouch?

187
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,370
只是我必须做出的一个战术决策而已
Just one of the many tactical decisions I've had to make already.

188
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,120
是沃德说我们需要这个的
And Ward said we needed it.

189
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,070
你们得在明早六点之前解除这个大杀伤力武器
You need to disable the overkill device by 0600 tomorrow

190
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,510
以阻止独立派的攻击
in order to prevent the separatist attack.

191
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,570
你们一给神盾局发信号
Once you signal S.H.I.E.L.D.,

192
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,920
救援小队就会马上带你们撤离
the extraction team will get you both out.

193
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,790
照顾好他
Take care of him.

194
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,610
是  长官
Of course, sir.

195
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,440
少说话多做事  沃德特工
More moving, less talking, Agent Ward.

196
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,770
我们时间可不多
Time's not on our side.

197
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,370
你觉得这样没问题吗
Does this feel okay to you?

198
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,300
我们不该跟他一起去吗
Shouldn't we be going with him?

199
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,270
参与本次行动的人员
The people who put these ops together

200
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,100
都是精英中的精英
are the best of the best.

201
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,640
他们很清楚自己在做什么
The know what they're doing.

202
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,150
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}高加索山

203
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,100
西蒙斯这会儿还什么都不知道呢
So Simmons, by this point, does not have a bloody clue.

204
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,690
我们在后面憋着笑
You know, we're in the back, trying to contain our laughter.

205
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,640
西蒙斯走进了真空室
So Simmons goes into the vacuum chamber wearing -- 

206
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,740
穿着兔子装
wearing a-a bunny suit.

207
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,200
我们这么叫是因为
Um, we just call it that because it

208
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,970
她全身都是
it covers your whole body.

209
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,600
她走进真空室
So she's in the vacuum chamber,

210
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,370
摘下面具要跟我说话
but when she takes her mask off to speak to me,

211
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,510
却把喷嚏都打在了法拉第杯上
she sneezes all over the Faraday cup...

212
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,880
多好笑
which is funny.

213
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,510
带信标了吗
Do you have the beacon?

214
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,290
带了
Yeah.

215
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,600
很好笑啊  因为真空室很干燥
But it's funny because vacuum chambers are so dry,

216
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,640
而这个仪器本来是要上太空的
and this instrument was actually supposed to go into space.

217
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,660
里面有高度灵敏的化学成分
It had sensitive chemical components.

218
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,280
西蒙斯说这故事效果比我要好得多
Simmons actually tells it a lot better than I do.

219
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,200
我的线人叫尤里・杜波斯基
Listen. My contact's Uri Dubrovsky.

220
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,610
我们付钱让他带我们过边境
We'll pay him to get us across the border.

221
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,190
我们认识很久了
We go back, 

222
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,350
但他不喜欢新人
but he doesn't like new people,

223
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,560
所以闭嘴低头
so keep your mouth shut and your head down.

224
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,790
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}晚上好

225
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,080
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}两杯纯伏特加酒

226
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,790
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}一杯我的

227
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,820
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}一杯给我朋友尤里

228
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,380
能问问他们有什么现成的酒吗
Um, can you ask what beers that they have on tap?

229
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,260
尤里是你朋友吗
Uri is your friend?

230
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,380
是的
Yeah.

231
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,710
尤里已经死了
Uri's dead.

232
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,150
你在这里没朋友
You have no friends here.

233
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,780
别别别
Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no.

234
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,440
请小心点
Please be careful.

235
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,390
你能想象要是菲兹回来发现
Can you imagine what Fitz would do

236
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,990
他的"晚安  宝贝"坏了会干出什么事来吗
if the night-night gun was broken when he came back?

237
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,950
他出外勤会没事的  对吧
Surely he'll be okay out there, right?

238
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,720
梅特工有七级权限
Well, Agent May is level 7.

239
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,470
也许她能透露一点任务的消息给我们
Maybe she can give us an update on their mission.

240
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,520
你这样是说
Does that mean

241
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,160
你知情  但不能透露给我们
that you do know something and you can't tell us,

242
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,560
还是你也不知情
or that you don't know anything?

243
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,850
这样面无表情是什么意思
Which non-expression is this?

244
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,280
我们只要知道应该知道的
We know what we're supposed to.

245
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,350
有更多信息  我们就会作出反应
When we have more information, we'll react.

246
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,980
好了  清场
All right, clear out.

247
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,430
我要做些检查诊断  然后重启
I need to run some diagnostics, then reboot.

248
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,740
你俩也是  都出去
That means you two. Off.

249
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,010
也许你们可以容忍不明不白
You guys may be okay with being in the dark,

250
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,000
我可不行
but I'm not into it.

251
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,710
我要答案
I need answers.

252
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,370
而我知道谁有
And I know just the person who has them.

253
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,670
谁
Who?

254
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,290
科尔森
Coulson.

255
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,340
当然是科尔森
I'm obviously talking about coulson.

256
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,680
我还需要三支空降兵在边境待命
I'm going to need three more chalks queued up at the border.

257
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,790
第四支在亚美尼亚待命吗
And a fourth standing by in Armenia?

258
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,300
好主意
Great minds.

259
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,080
从那架飞机上下来感觉一定很好吧
It must be nice to be off that plane.

260
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,600
我知道你已经差不多康复了
I understand you're almost through your recovery.

261
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,090
那架飞机跟我的康复没有任何关系
The plane has nothing to do with my recovery.

262
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,970
我只知道档案里的信息
I only know what I've read.

263
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,860
弗瑞似乎对他喜欢的人很关照嘛
Seems Fury has a soft spot for his favorites.

264
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,660
不是所有人都会被送去塔希提岛
Not everyone gets sent to Tahiti.

265
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,890
那是个充满魔力的地方
It's a magical...place.

266
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,150
我的意思是回到大部队的感觉一定很好
All I meant was it must feel good to be back in the big leagues.

267
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,030
我的两个特工是这次行动的关键
Two of my agents are the key to this operation.

268
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,730
我从来没离开过大部队
I never left the bigs.

269
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,360
希望他们像你说的那么好
Let's hope they're as good as you think they are.

270
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,260
发生了什么事
What's happening?

271
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,900
为什么他们还不杀掉我们
Why haven't they killed us yet?

272
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,280
我是说  我很高兴他们还没杀掉我们
I mean, I'm glad that they haven't killed us yet.

273
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,230
他们在等他们的头儿
They're waiting for their boss,

274
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,580
他来之前  我们得做个计划
so before he gets here, we need a plan.

275
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,490
你能在水下屏气多长时间
How long can you hold your breath underwater?

276
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,760
我不知道
I don't know.

277
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,890
你知道"强棒出击"这个词吗
You familiar with the term "slam and cram"?

278
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,010
不  我也不想知道
No, and I d-- I don't think I want to be.

279
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,260
你的小指对你有多重要
How attached are you to your pinky?

280
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,400
非常非常重要  而且在你问出
Very, very attached, and before you ask

281
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,440
下一个吓死人的问题之前
another terrifyingly vague question,

282
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,620
让我把话说清楚
let me be clear.

283
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,070
任何需要牵扯到暴力的计划
Any plan that involves even one of those scenarios

284
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,490
对我都没用
isn't going to work for me.

285
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,330
实际上  我
As a matter of fact, I've --

286
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,750
听说你在找你的朋友尤里
I heard you were looking for your friend Uri.

287
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,620
尤里是分裂主义者的朋友
And Uri was friends with separatists.

288
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,440
你是分裂主义者吗
Are you separatists?

289
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,520
不
No. 

290
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,400
我们是来阻止他们的
We're here to stop them.

291
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,840
绝对是来阻止他们的
Definitely here to stop them.

292
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,120
相信我
Trust me.

293
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,780
如果你能帮我们越过边境
If you could just help us get across the border --

294
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,820
{\an8}真想回去看比赛

295
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,680
你在浪费我的时间  我把话说明吧
You're wasting my time, so let me be clear.

296
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,190
你没有给我信任你的理由
You've given me no reason to trust you.

297
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,880
信任对我来说就是一切
And trust is everything to me.

298
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,620
你好  很高兴在这里见到你
Hey. Fancy seeing you here.

299
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,920
斯凯
Skye, 

300
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,260
我说过我会查你父母的档案的
I told you I'd look into the file about your parents.

301
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,160
我知道  我不是为那事儿来的
No, I know. That's not why I'm here.

302
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,410
我想知道更多关于沃德和菲兹的任务的事
I wanted to know more about Ward and Fitz's mission.

303
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,380
菲兹不在  西蒙斯已经快抓狂了
Simmons is seriously starting to unravel without Fitz.

304
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,310
我知道这话不好听
I know it's hard to hear,

305
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,320
但是你没有权限
but you don't have the clearance.

306
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,220
但我有眼睛啊
But I have eyes.

307
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,650
我看见六支全副武装的小队
I saw six squads in full tactical gear,

308
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,100
三箱火箭炮
three crates of RPGs,

309
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,590
还有一整队分析员指挥行动
and a full crew of analysts head to operations.

310
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,640
你真的打算告诉我
Are you really telling me

311
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,110
这些都跟沃德和菲兹的任务没关系吗
that has nothing to do with Ward and Fitz's mission?

312
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,390
如果我是对的
If I'm right,

313
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,550
你不用说话  给个信号就行
give me a signal by not saying anything.

314
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,310
要相信组织
Trust the system.

315
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,240
进展如何
How did it go?

316
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:56,810
一无所获
Nothing.

317
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,100
他现在就好像是个机器人一样
He's acting like a robot version of himself right now.

318
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,750
如果我们想知道真相
If we want the truth,

319
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,480
就得自己去找
we've got to get it ourselves.

320
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,390
好吧
Okay.

321
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,070
那你的建议是...
How would you suggest --

322
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,320
等等  不
Oh, wait. No. No.

323
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,610
-是的  -不
- Yes. - No!

324
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,110
我可不能成为你坏女孩恶作剧的一部分
I can't be a part of your bad-girl shenanigans.

325
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,370
我喜欢循规蹈矩  该做什么做什么
I like following the rules and doing what's expected of me.

326
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,510
这让我觉得安心
It makes me feel nice.

327
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,390
西蒙斯  醒醒吧
Simmons, wake up!

328
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,310
沃德和菲兹去执行绝密两人任务了
Ward and Fitz went on a top-secret, two-man operation,

329
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,190
而且你看
and look.

330
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,330
人越来越多
There are more men.

331
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,410
所以要么就是有什么大事件他们没告诉我们
And either it's a bigger deal and they're not telling us,

332
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,940
要么就是出什么问题了
or something went wrong out there.

333
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,240
也许我们帮不上什么忙
And maybe there's nothing we can to do help,

334
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,540
但如果能帮上忙  那就要先知情才行
but we got to know if there is.

335
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,240
万一他们受伤了或是正在被拷打怎么办
What if they're injured or being tortured somewhere right now?

336
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,740
菲兹
Fitz.

337
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,440
被严刑拷打
Tortured.

338
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,240
说说你的计划是什么
What exactly do you have in mind?

339
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,630
好了  够低了
Okay! Enough!

340
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,680
好吧
Okay.

341
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,970
稍微往左一点  弗拉基米尔
A little to the left, Vladimir.

342
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,500
慢点
Gentle!

343
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,990
慢点
Gentle.

344
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,680
就是这样  好了
That's it. Okay.

345
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,350
能再给我点照明吗  玛塔
Can I get a little more light down here, Marta?

346
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,790
当然  米什卡[俄语]
Of course, mishka.

347
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,530
谢谢你  亲爱的
Thank you, sweetheart.

348
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,230
你叫他熊宝宝
Little bear?

349
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,570
我喜欢看他干活的样子
I like watching him work,

350
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,240
那只熊宝宝
That little bear.

351
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,920
搞定了
Okay.

352
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,180
小事一桩
It's nothing.

353
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,390
真的
Really.

354
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,990
我只是个普通人而已
I'm just a man.

355
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,280
给这位普通人来杯酒
Get this man a drink.

356
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,330
不用了  好  喝就喝吧
Oh, no. Here we go.

357
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,400
咸咸的
Salty.

358
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,560
现在...
So...

359
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,740
我们来谈谈正事吧
Let's talk business.

360
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,520
你花了两百万卢布吗
Two million rubles?

361
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,000
看来你得好好学学谈判技巧了
We need to work on your negotiation skills.

362
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,090
我以为卢布跟比索一样不值钱
I thought they were like pesos.

363
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,200
再说了
And anyway, 

364
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,260
你该感谢我
you should be thanking me.

365
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,590
在我们被绑着的时候是我用小型电磁脉冲
I shorted the fuse box with my localized E.M.P.

366
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,260
才让保险丝盒短路的
when we were tied up.

367
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,580
真的吗
Really?

368
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,010
没错  而我的计划也成功了
Yes, and my plan worked

369
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,660
现在我们不是越过边境了吗
Because we're over the border now, aren't we?

370
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,220
我们停下来了  为什么会停下来
We're stopping. Why are we stopping?

371
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,830
别出声
Quiet.

372
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,790
待在这里  我去看看什么情况
Stay here. I'll check it out.

373
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,970
好吧
Okay.

374
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,680
我们还是都先待着好了
Maybe we'll both stay here.

375
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,160
菲兹  更多边境巡逻的人来了
Fitz! More border patrol.

376
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,180
我已经开溜了  快跟上
Already moving! Hurry up!

377
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,490
抱歉  我打扰到你了吗
Sorry. Am I disturbing you?

378
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,850
知道吗  我喜欢这架飞机
You know, I like this plane.

379
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,930
我喜欢这里的工作方式
I like the way we do things here.

380
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,400
大家都对情况一样了解  没有机密
Everyone's on the same page, no red tape.

381
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,430
目前看来  这种方式挺适合我们的
So far, it's working for us.

382
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,960
至少对大部分人来说
Most of us.

383
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,290
或许我比以前优柔寡断了
And maybe I'm getting soft,

384
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,500
但我不喜欢对我们的队员有所隐瞒
But I don't like keeping things from our team.

385
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,120
如果你知道...
If you knew --

386
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,290
不  你是对的
No. You're right.

387
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,700
8级特权
Level 8.

388
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,090
但是...
But --

389
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,650
我懂的
I know.

390
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,590
相信组织
Trust the system.

391
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,610
梅
May?

392
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,910
谢谢你
Thanks.

393
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,050
笑一个
Say cheese.

394
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,750
{\an8}准许进入  珍玛・西蒙斯
5级特工

395
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,550
闪存在你手上了  去吧
Okay, you have the flash drive. Go

396
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,850
我编写了一个伪装搜索程序
I programmed it with a decoy crawler.

397
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,420
它会用我的网页浏览记录
It'll use my browser history

398
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,000
来模拟我平时的上网活动
to simulate my usual online activity.

399
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,880
所以当神盾局以为我在用你给我的电脑
So while S.H.I.E.L.D thinks I'm trolling Reddit and Facebook

400
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,580
上无聊的社交网站时
with the laptop you gave me --

401
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,270
你其实正在偷取沃德和菲兹的任务文件
You'll be hacking the files for Ward and Fitz's mission.

402
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:36,970
没错
Right.

403
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,430
记住  一旦你插入闪存
And remember, once you plug it in,

404
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:38,950
你只有...
you'll only have about --

405
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,650
三分钟的时间不被神盾局察觉
Three minutes before S.H.I.E.L.D. catches on.

406
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,860
你发现了吗  你一直在接我的...
Do you realize that you keep finishing my sent--

407
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,200
你的句子  我知道
Your sentences. I know.

408
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,840
抱歉  我一紧张就这样
I'm sorry. Bad habit.

409
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,640
这还挺刺激的
This is actually a bit thrilling.

410
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,300
那真不错  你开心就好
Ah, good. I'm glad.

411
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,110
现在我们得想个法子把面板打开
Now we've just got to figure out a way to get the panel open.

412
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,470
别担心  我有特制工具
Don't worry. I made a special something.

413
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,090
我就是干这行的
It's what we do.

414
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,710
搞定了
All done.

415
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,040
真的吗  好厉害
Really? Wow. Okay.

416
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,250
现在只要找到一个USB插口就好
Uh, now just find a USB port.

417
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,210
好的
Okay.

418
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,830
西蒙斯特工
Agent Simmons?

419
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,640
没事  淡定
It's fine. Just play it cool.

420
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,900
你好  西特韦尔特工先生
Hello, Mr. Agent Sitwell, sir.

421
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,740
需要我帮忙吗
May I help you?

422
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,990
排污管
Drainage pipe.

423
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,790
我们在那里等他们出来
We'll wait them out over there.

424
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,570
我们不能等太久
We can't wait too long.

425
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,300
如果他们使用超强杀伤性武器
If they use the overkill device,

426
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,100
边境的所有人都有危险
everyone on the border's in danger.

427
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,960
我知道
I'm aware.

428
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,090
也包括玛塔和弗拉德
And that includes Marta and Vlad.

429
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,670
你跟他们已经熟到直呼其名了啊
Oh, you're on a first-name basis now?

430
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,240
我就是说
Yeah, well, I'm just saying,

431
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,190
他们现在也有生命危险
their lives are on the line, too,

432
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,120
所以我们还是别太安逸了
so let's not get too comfortable.

433
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,740
叫我贾斯珀
Call me Jasper.

434
00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:00,080
这么晚了  什么风还把您吹到这机密走廊来了
What brings you to this restricted hallway so late at night?

435
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,920
我也想问你这个问题呢
I could ask you the same thing.

436
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,550
别  别问
No. Don't.

437
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,830
西蒙斯  专注  编个理由就可以了
Simmons, focus. Just make up an excuse.

438
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,730
我就是要去厕所
I was just on my way to the loo.

439
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,660
我敢肯定是右转右转再左转啊
I could swear it was two rights and a left,

440
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,960
但不在这里吗
but is that it here?

441
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,420
这是个墙面电脑板
That's a wall panel.

442
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,910
你摆弄这个干什么
Why are you accessing it?

443
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,980
别犹豫  说点什么  随便什么
Don't spiral. Just say something. Anything.

444
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:27,220
你脑袋长得真英俊啊
You certainly have a gorgeous head, don't you?

445
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,620
什么
What?

446
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,180
我就喜欢跟我差不多高
I like men that are about my height,

447
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,520
但是比我壮的男人
but heavier than me.

448
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,630
别说话了  停
Stop talking. Stop.

449
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,660
西蒙斯特工
Agent Simmons,

450
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,690
你有操作这个电脑板的许可吗
do you have authorization to access that panel?

451
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,130
说是的  说你有
Say yes. Say you do.

452
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,320
是...当然了
Y-- of course.

453
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,790
-很好  对  -当然了
- Great. Yeah. - Of course.

454
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,470
我肯定就放在我包里呢
Um, I certainly have it right here in my bag.

455
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,320
他盯上我了
He's onto me.

456
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,160
别跟我说话  他能听到
Stop talking to me! He can hear you!

457
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,940
你是在跟人通讯吗
Are you on comms with someone?

458
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,260
我是西特韦尔特工  我需要一名警卫
This is Agent Sitwell. I need an escort.

459
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,680
对不起
Aah! I'm sorry!

460
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,870
我的天呐  我的天呐
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

461
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,950
好吧  好吧
Okay. Okay.

462
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,420
我干净利落地射晕了西特韦尔特工
I've definitely shot Agent Sitwell.

463
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,690
不错不错不错
Good, good, good.

464
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,930
刚才还好吧
Was that all right?

465
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,250
是非常糟糕
That was terrible.

466
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,180
你做这个实在弱爆了  那完全是个灾难
You are terrible at this. That was a total meltdown.

467
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,900
晚安枪就在这  我就...
The night-night gun was right there, and I

468
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,910
我们需要帮助  你得去找梅过来
We need help. You need to go get May.

469
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,760
梅  不要
May?! No!

470
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,270
听着
Listen.

471
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,380
闪存盘只能给我
That flash drive will only give me

472
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,440
几分钟时间访问中心的主机
a few minutes of access to the Hub's mainframe

473
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,830
查清我们的人发生了什么事
to find out what happened to our boys...

474
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,210
所以你快去找梅  好吗
...so just go get May, okay?

475
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,740
就跟她说这是个意外
Just tell her it was an accident.

476
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,070
我要上军事法庭了
I'm going to be court-martialed.

477
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,560
希望这个能成功
I hope this works.

478
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,320
你觉得神盾局为什么只派我们两个
Why do you think S.H.I.E.L.D. sent in just the two of us?

479
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,250
我不知道
I don't know.

480
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,980
他们说需要一个你这样的和一个我这样的
They said they needed a guy like you and a guy like me.

481
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,500
那是三明治吗
Is that a sandwich?

482
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,370
西蒙斯做的
Simmons made it.

483
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,820
我的最爱
My favorite.

484
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,960
熏火腿野牛肉和奶酪
Prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella

485
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,850
再加一点点蒜泥蛋黄酱
with a hint of pesto aioli.

486
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,120
给  可以分你一半
Here. You can have half.

487
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,030
搞什么鬼啊
What the hell?

488
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,590
有狗在追踪我们
There are dogs tracking us,

489
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,920
你还带个火腿三明治
and you bring a prosciutto sandwich.

490
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,960
真不敢相信你刚做了什么
I can't believe you just did that.

491
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,720
这是在执行任务  不是野餐
This is a mission, not a picnic.

492
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,600
我很清楚这不是野餐  救世主先生
Oh, I'm well aware it's not a picnic, Mr. Save the Day.

493
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,040
这话是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

494
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,740
拜托  你显然乐在其中
Oh, come on. You obviously get off on it,

495
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,490
做为一个常胜将军
being the guy who always gets to throw the last punch,

496
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,400
每次都能从天而降英雄救美
who always swoops in to save the girl.

497
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,320
现在你又摧毁了
And now you've destroyed

498
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,800
世上最危险的三明治
the world's most dangerous sandwich.

499
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,790
恭喜啊
Congratulations.

500
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,280
我跟你说
Well, I'll tell you something.

501
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,140
我不需要什么人救我  格兰特・沃德
I don't need to be rescued by anyone, Grant Ward.

502
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,490
-好...  -仔细听
- Yeah. - Oh, and listen.

503
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,360
我们出发前
Before we left,

504
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,540
科尔森让我照顾你
Coulson told me to take care of you.

505
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,040
所以我只负责照顾你  不多不少
That is what I am doing. Nothing more, nothing less.

506
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,040
给你
Here.

507
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,560
饿了的话先吃这个吧
If you're hungry, eat this.

508
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,200
是没有气味的
It's odorless.

509
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,240
好了
All right, boys.

510
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,940
来看看你们到底在哪里
Let's find out where you really are.

511
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,750
{\an8}神盾局中枢主机

512
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,710
{\an8}当前任务

513
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,360
已编辑文件
"Redacted documents."

514
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,750
{\an8}已编辑文件

515
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,510
好
Okay.

516
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,310
89.4.26

517
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,480
好
Okay.

518
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,050
找到了  要是能看到原始文件就好了
There it is...if I could just access the raw file.

519
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,960
糟了  时间不够了
Oh, crap. I don't have any time.

520
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,680
{\an8}神盾局中枢主机
当前任务

521
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,870
{\an8}南奥塞梯

522
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,550
{\an8}神盾局任务

523
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:34,430
{\an8}"赶尽杀绝"行动
南奥塞梯
军队地点

524
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,610
{\an8}状态  两人小队
时刻表  8:00
营救计划  无

525
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,660
天哪
Oh, my God.

526
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,190
无营救计划
No extraction!

527
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,700
我是怎么跟你说的
What did I tell you?

528
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,110
你让我相信组织
You told me to trust the system.

529
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,270
可组织却让沃德和菲茨去送死
And the system sent Ward and Fitz in there to die.

530
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,290
这年头当老鼠真好
Good day to be a rat.

531
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,210
老鼠可以只管自己的事
I mean, there you are, minding your own business,

532
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,030
散播污秽和疾病  自己去找虫子吃
spreading filth and disease, scavenging for grub worms

533
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,490
或者是烂水果
or rotten fruit,

534
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,500
你瞧  突然就看到了
When lo and behold, you see it --

535
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,420
火腿牛肉奶酪三明治
a prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella sandwich...

536
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,700
菲茨
Fitz.

537
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,760
上面还有蒜泥蛋黄酱
...with just a hint of pesto aioli.

538
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,280
安静
Quiet.

539
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,430
感觉到了吗
Feel that?

540
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,070
是卡车
A truck.

541
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,510
马上过来了  快把袋子拉好
It's coming. Zip up the mag pouch.

542
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,820
我说过会帮你找你家人的信息的
I told you I'd get answers about your family.

543
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,560
我不是在找我家人的信息
That's not what I was looking for!

544
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,400
我是想看看
I was trying to find out

545
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,290
沃德和菲茨到底是去干什么了
what was happening with Ward and Fitz.

546
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,670
那是机密行动
That's a classified operation.

547
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,560
明明是自杀行动
It's a suicide mission!

548
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,420
我都看到了
I saw it all --

549
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,290
军队布置还有空袭安排
The troop placements, the aerial assault.

550
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,720
一旦沃德和菲茨解除装置
Once Ward and Fitz disable that device,

551
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,140
那里就会发动大规模进攻
there's going to be a huge attack on that compound,

552
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,170
但是没有营救计划  你却没跟我们说
with no extraction plan, and you hid that from us.

553
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,280
我没瞒你什么
I didn't hide anything from you.

554
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,190
你是没有权限了解详情
You don't have the clearance to know that.

555
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,220
神盾局就是这样吗
Is that really what S.H.I.E.L.D.'s all about?

556
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,610
八级权限者的命比五级权限的值钱
Level 5s are more expendable than level 8?

557
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,050
我们对你来说就只是数字吗
Is that all we are, just a number to you?

558
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,150
你说完了吗
Are you done?

559
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,350
我不知道  你说呢
I don't know. Am I?

560
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,740
如果神盾局没跟你说明
If s.H.I.E.L.D. keeps a secret from you,

561
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,700
那肯定是有原因的
it's for a good reason.

562
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,800
-秘密都只有自己知道吗  -不要打断我说话
- So they can hold all the secrets. - Don't interrupt.

563
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,220
你刚才黑进了八级权限的服务器
You just hacked a level-8 secure server,

564
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,630
看到了自己不该看的行动计划
saw operational plans that you have no context for.

565
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,660
如果一旦泄露
If details get out,

566
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,370
整个行动可能因此失败
the whole operation could be compromised,

567
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,170
会有人因此丧命  包括沃德和菲茨
lives could be lost, Ward and Fitz among them.

568
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,140
我知道  那两个人正是我们担心的
I know. Those are two people we care about.

569
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,970
在飞机上时  你一直跟我说
On the plane, you're always telling me

570
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,310
要跳出思维定势  所以我才违反规定
to think outside the box, so I went off book

571
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,910
因为我想帮他们留意着点保护他们
'cause I was trying to watch their backs.

572
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,180
我们的团队可以违反规定是因为有规定可循
Our team can go off book because there is a book.

573
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,440
一个中心
A hub.

574
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,230
一个可以作为坚强后盾的组织
An organization watching our backs.

575
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,240
你说你想成为其中的一员
You claim that you want to be a part of that,

576
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,480
成为一名神盾局的特工
a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

577
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
不是么
Do you?

578
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,300
是的
Yes.

579
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
因为未来的某一天
Because someday,

580
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,120
我可能会让你背负一个秘密
I may have to trust you with a secret,

581
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,600
但那之前我需要确定你可以保守那个秘密
and I need to know that you can keep it.

582
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,060
我可以问你个问题么
Can I ask you one question?

583
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,330
什么
What?

584
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:24,770
你知道根本没有沃德和菲兹的营救方案么
Did you know there was no extraction plan for Ward and Fitz?

585
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,420
这是机密信息
That's classified.

586
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,210
好了  快快
Okay. Go. Go. Go.

587
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,010
快  快  快
Go, go, go.

588
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,020
我来发撤离讯号
I'll signal extraction.

589
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,310
好的
Okay.

590
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,220
西蒙斯管这个叫"魔术窗"
Simmons calls it "The magic window."

591
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,820
你可能会问  这是X射线技术么
You'd probably guess, "Is that x-ray technology?"

592
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,530
实际上这张纸里嵌入了
There are actually s-band microwave antennae

593
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,980
S频段微波天线
embedded in this sheet.

594
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,470
工作原理更像是个雷达系统
Works more like a radar system, really.

595
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:24,970
好吧
Okay.

596
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,170
我们来看看
Let's see.

597
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:33,200
西边墙壁有两个守卫
Okay, we have two guards on the west wall.

598
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,770
两人都配备了自动武器
Both carrying automatic weapons.

599
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,760
纠正一下  是三个守卫
Correction. Make that three guards.

600
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,400
我们现在需要面对三个守卫了
We have three guards now.

601
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:41,860
天哪
Oh, my God.

602
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,090
天哪  沃德  那个人在袭击另两个人
Oh, my God, Ward. He's attacking the others.

603
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,740
他朝我们过来了
He's coming straight for us.

604
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,750
沃德
Ward.

605
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,920
沃德
Ward?!

606
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,760
快点  进来
Hurry. Inside.

607
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,680
现在我明白了
That makes sense now.

608
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,060
一定就是这个了
This must be it.

609
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,960
好怪
Weird.

610
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,630
内核一定在里面  那才是最重要的部分
Core must be inside here. That's what's important.

611
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,320
周围的这些管道只是为了增强和定位声音
The piping around it just serves to amplify and direct the sound,

612
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,320
以便远距离引爆炸药
to trigger munitions from a distance.

613
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,890
看起来不像是个能把飞机炸下来的东西
Doesn't look like it could take a jet out of the sky.

614
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,000
沃德特工  你现在你应该明白的
Well, you should know by now, Agent Ward,

615
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,670
人不可貌相
that looks can be deceiving.

616
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,810
好了么
Good?

617
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,770
好了
Yeah.

618
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,270
这可能要费点时间
This is gonna take a while.

619
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:53,780
给你十分钟
You have 10 minutes.

620
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,420
我以为你会说五分钟
I thought you'd say five.

621
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,830
西特韦尔特工现在在医务室
Agent Sitwell is in the infirmary.

622
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,020
很显然  你的一名队员
Apparently, a member of your team

623
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,190
把他给打晕了
rendered him unconscious.

624
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,330
只是个误会
A misunderstanding.

625
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,640
我会内部解决的
I'll handle the matter internally.

626
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,370
击晕一名特工不能算是误会
Tranquilizing an agent does not qualify as a misunderstanding.

627
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,420
你说得对
You're right.

628
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,180
但在没有营救小组的情况下
But being told there's an extraction team in place

629
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,440
却声称有
when, in fact, there isn't,

630
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,410
这就算误会了吧
that does.

631
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,720
我是八级权限
I'm level 8.

632
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:22,100
我有权知道关乎我小队安危的信息
I'm entitled to information regarding the welfare of my team.

633
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,180
你应该告诉我
You should have told me.

634
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,640
看来我用不着说了
Seemed I didn't have to.

635
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,200
知道了又能怎样呢  科尔森特工
And what would that have changed, Agent Coulson?

636
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,150
你自己也设计了很多这样的任务
You yourself have designed dozens of operations like this.

637
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,120
你知道这是什么情况
You know how this works.

638
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,660
通常我们都有个营救计划
Usually with an extraction plan.

639
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,600
巴顿[鹰眼]  罗曼诺夫[黑寡妇]
Barton, Romanoff --

640
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,000
他们从来没有营救计划
they never have an extraction plan.

641
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,640
但他们一开始就已经知道这种情况了
They know that going in.

642
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,720
菲兹特工根本没有实战经验
Agent Fitz is unproven in the field,

643
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,210
知道实情只会分散他的注意力和勇气
and knowing would have caused him to lose focus or courage.

644
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,890
那也应当由我来决定
That should have been my call.

645
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,890
我不确定你会答应
I wasn't sure you'd comply.

646
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:47,450
你的队伍里面包括一个带着电子号牌
Your team includes an electronically tagged non-agent

647
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,750
以走漏风声出名的非特工人员
who is notorious for leaking secrets,

648
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,560
这也提醒了我
which reminds me --

649
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,130
你是怎么得知这些信息的
how did you get this information again?

650
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,780
我知道一千人性命的价值
I know what the safety of a thousand men is worth.

651
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,470
我也知道销毁这个超强杀伤性武器的重要性
I know the importance of taking the overkill device out of play.

652
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:02,520
但我也了解我的人和他们的价值
But I also know my men and what they're worth!

653
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,580
参加与否应该由他们自己来决定
The decision to go in should have been theirs to make.

654
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,200
也许吧
Perhaps.

655
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,250
但是你要相信组织  科尔森特工
But you need to trust the system, Agent Coulson.

656
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,060
好了
All right.

657
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,140
告诉我使这玩意失效的最后步骤吧
Show me the final steps to disable this thing.

658
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,240
我会去搞定的
I'll get it done.

659
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,220
不  我们要坚持撤离方案
No, we stick to the extraction plan.

660
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,670
还有一分钟我就搞定了
I'll be done in a minute.

661
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,490
撤离方案搞砸了
The extraction plan's a bust.

662
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,770
说啥
What?

663
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,850
撤离部队没联系上
Exfil team didn't make contact.

664
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,130
一旦你把那东西拆了
Once you take that thing apart

665
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,640
我就发出远程信标  我们就只能靠自己了
and I set off the remote beacon, we're on our own.

666
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,000
你该走了
You should go.

667
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,780
我不走
I'm not leaving.

668
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,330
菲兹  没时间争论了
Fitz, there's no time to argue.

669
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,790
你认为我搞不定这些吗
You don't think I can't handle this?

670
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,880
不是  我只是想保护
No, I am trying to protect --

671
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,090
你认为我是个胆小鬼  是吧
Ah, you think I'm a coward. Is that it?

672
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,410
什么  当然不是
What? No.

673
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,230
我和你一样是一名神盾局特工
I am every bit the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent that you are.

674
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,240
你不必去证明给别人看
You don't have anything to prove.

675
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,510
你说我总是喜欢在最后时刻救人
What you said about me always needing to swoop in --

676
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,620
我知道换做是你  也会跳下飞机救西蒙斯
I know you would have jumped out of the plane to save Simmons,

677
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,770
她也知道这点
and she knows that, too.

678
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,870
我并不是想向任何人证明任何事
I'm not trying to prove anything to anyone.

679
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,910
好吗  在我们离开之前
Okay? Before we left, you're not the only one

680
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,630
科尔森也找过我
that Coulson talked to, okay?

681
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,630
他也叫我照顾你
He told me to take care of you, too.

682
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,140
这正是我要做的
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

683
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,000
我哪儿也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

684
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,170
你明白吗
You understand?

685
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,900
而且我快饿死了
And I'm bloody starving.

686
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,360
你拿到情报了  我们要做出反应
You got the information. Now we react.

687
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,380
我们要去接我们的队员
We're gonna get our guys.

688
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,330
总得有人去做
Somebody has to.

689
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,510
那神盾局的袭击呢
What about the S.H.I.E.L.D. assault?

690
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,170
我们不会去干预
We won't interfere.

691
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,160
撤离行动不需要一个军营
You don't need a battalion for an extraction.

692
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,110
三人就能全身而退
Three can pull it off.

693
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,350
四个会更好
Four's better.

694
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,130
你来吗
You're in?

695
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,540
我以为我们要到八级权限才能讨论这件事
I thought we all had to be level 8 to discuss this.

696
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,180
我们什么也不讨论
We're not discussing anything.

697
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,530
菲兹  最后一次机会
Last chance, Fitz.

698
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,480
你确定你不想先撤退吗
Are you sure you don't want a head start?

699
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,760
因为在你扯掉最后一根电线那刻
Because the second you pull that final wire --

700
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,920
轮到你了
Your turn.

701
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,210
信标接通了  装置关闭了
Beacon's hot. The device is disabled.

702
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,390
开始行动
Mission's a go.

703
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,580
我们走吧
Let's go.

704
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,850
我们要在他们发现这装置关闭之前
We need to slip out of here before they notice

705
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,320
逃出去
the device is powered down.

706
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,630
明白
Got it.

707
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,600
我们需要一个新的计划
We need a new plan.

708
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,520
-你确定这能行吗  -能
- Are you sure this is gonna work? - Yes.

709
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,040
理论上来说
Theoretically.

710
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:58,850
拿着
Hold it.

711
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,970
好了  完成
Okay. Finished.

712
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,810
刚才那是怎么回事
What was that?

713
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:10,150
是神盾局
S.H.I.E.L.D.

714
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,990
他们已经开始攻击了
They've started their attack,

715
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,990
这意味着在他们炸毁基地之前
which means we don't have much time

716
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,700
我们的时间不多了
before they crush the compound.

717
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,580
爬到上面去  用这玩意
Get up there and take out

718
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,450
尽可能多地击落他们的武器
as many of their weapons as you can with that thing.

719
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,280
菲兹  就是现在
Fitz!

720
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,350
在你后面
Behind you!

721
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,750
我把他击晕了
I just did that.

722
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,480
好了  我们走吧
Okay. Let's go.

723
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,200
你说他们需要像你我这样的人是吗
You said they needed a guy like me and a guy like you, right?

724
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,440
是的
Right.

725
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,780
撤离部队来了
It's the extraction team!

726
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,190
来了更好的
Better.

727
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,460
是铁骑
It's the Cavalry.

728
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,900
就是喜欢看这种场面
Never get tired of seeing that.

729
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,360
科尔森的手下脱险了吗
Are Coulson's people clear?

730
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,370
脱险了
They are.

731
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,770
我没想到会有撤离行动
I thought there wasn't gonna be an extraction.

732
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,680
我们的所有人力需要用在别处
All our resources were needed elsewhere.

733
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,830
再说这是科尔森特工的队伍  他们不需要
And it's Agent Coulson's team. They didn't need one.

734
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,370
好了  去善后吧
Okay. Let's mop up.

735
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,090
谢谢来接应我们  长官
Thanks for coming to get us, sir.

736
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,080
我们自己人要照顾好自己人
We take care of our own.

737
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,620
干得好  菲兹
Well done, Fitz.

738
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:47,980
很高兴你安然无恙
So glad you're all right.

739
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,440
是啊
Yep.

740
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,880
再见到你也很高兴
Good to see you, too.

741
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,250
那个三明治...怎么样
The sandwich...how was it?

742
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,710
蒜泥蛋黄酱太多了吗
Too much aioli?

743
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,190
很美味
It was delicious.

744
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,890
曾经有那么一秒
You know, for a second there,

745
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,530
我还以为自己得找一个新监管人员了
I thought I'd have to find a new supervising officer.

746
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,040
抱歉让你失望了
Sorry to disappoint.

747
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,550
事实上  我被照顾得很好
Truth is, I was in good hands.

748
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,820
我一直在照看着沃德
I had Ward's back the whole time.

749
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,800
是啊
Yeah.

750
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,460
差不多把他从一伙俄罗斯暴徒手中救了出来
Pretty much saved him from a gang of Russian mobsters

751
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,240
还撂倒了几个家伙
and kicked a few guys' heads in.

752
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,850
不过关于任务的事情说得够多了
But enough mission talk already.

753
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,820
中心有什么激动人心的事情发生吗
Um, anything exciting happen at the Hub?

754
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,590
我向一位上级长官胸口开了一枪
I shot a superior officer in the chest.

755
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,750
我在想今天的事  我非常抱歉...
I was thinking about today, and I'm really sorry...

756
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,130
我只是想让你知道我没有忘记
I just wanted to let you know that I didn't forget

757
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:57,200
你在中心要求我的事情
about what you asked me back at the Hub.

758
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,580
什么意思
Uh, what do you mean?

759
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,480
关于你过去的未编辑档案
The un-redacted file about your past.

760
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,200
我找到了
I found it.

761
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,910
上面说了什么
Uh, w-what did it say?

762
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,050
文档不是直接关于你的
The document wasn't about you directly.

763
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,200
是关于把你
It was about the person

764
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,270
放在孤儿院的那个人的
who dropped you off at the orphanage.

765
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,010
结果发现那个人是一名神盾局特工
Turns out, it was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

766
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,190
一名神盾局特工吗
A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?

767
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,500
为什么  我是说  是谁  那是什么意思  我...
Why? I mean, who? What does that mean? I --

768
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,300
特工身分不明
The agent was unidentified.

769
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,200
我们不知道她是你的母亲
We don't know if she was your mother

770
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,520
还是只是在门口捡到了你
