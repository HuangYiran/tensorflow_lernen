00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if I were in your shoes I'd probably feel the same.

261
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was hoping you would explain my father's side of it

00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your crime is that you use people!

01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:35,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. He's autistic.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not familiar with that.

1010
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:40,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is the exact nature of the problem?

1011
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:43,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He lives in a world of his own.

1012
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:47,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry but what's wrong with him?

1013
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do a little of "What's on First?" for her.

1014
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's on first. What's on second.

01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:07,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where a Pony Express would ride for approximately 20 miles...

1017
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:12,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What am I supposed to do? There's gotta be something I can do.

1018
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not a psychiatrist

01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I do know that his brain doesn't work like other people.

1020
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:20,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What he does isn't intended to be annoying.

1021
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:23,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he's getting on your nerves just take a break.

1022
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:26,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Spend time away from him. - Sure I'll just send him back.

1023
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sorry? - Nothing it's an inside joke.

1024
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:31,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're telling me I just have to deal with this?

1025
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just gotta deal with this stuff?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah that's about it.

1027
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:39,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out of curiosity does he have any special abilities?

1028
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:43,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well he's got a pretty good memory.

1029
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:45,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He counts toothpicks.

01:43:18,950 --> 01:43:21,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not right what you're doing to Raymond.

1613
01:43:22,290 --> 01:43:23,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's fine.

1614
01:43:23,590 --> 01:43:24,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know he's fine...

1615
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:28,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he's in Las Vegas in a suit in a big room.

1616
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:29,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It makes me sad.

1617
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:31,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Six minutes to my date.

1618

1620
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:41,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Raymond it'd be nice if you didn't carry that television everywhere.

1621
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:44,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you gotta bring a Watchman for on your date?

1622

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The man's dancing.

1623
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:48,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what does your date look like?

1624
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:52,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's very sparkly. She looks like a holiday.

1625
01:43:54,690 --> 01:43:56,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think I've heard that one before.

1626
01:43:57,820 --> 01:43:59,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Kelso would like to see you.

1627
01:43:59,730 --> 01:44:01,160

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure. Susanna why don't you stay with Raymond?

1630
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right this way sir.

1631
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:13,260


1632
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:15,570


1633
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:17,770


1634
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:24,470


1635

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Congratulations Mr. Babbitt.

1640
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Counting into a six-deck shoe is quite a feat.

1641
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:45,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid I don't understand what you're talking about.

1642
01:44:45,370 --> 01:44:49,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We make videotapes Mr. Babbitt and we analyze the tapes

1643

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we even share some of the information with the other casinos.

1644
01:44:51,950 --> 01:44:55,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These tapes suggest that you should take your winnings and leave the state.

1645
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:57,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone has a good day at the tables

1646
01:44:58,020 --> 01:45:00,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you accuse them of illegal activities?

1647
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:02,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this how you treat all your guests?

1648
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:05,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All you have to do is close your mouth and go home.

1649
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:08,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those are the best odds you're gonna see for a while.

1650
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd take'em.

1651
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:21,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you want to dance on your date?

1652
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:24,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There'll be other chances.

1653
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:26,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Many pretty girls would love to dance with you.

1654
01:45:27,450 --> 01:45:28,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna be okay.

1655
01:45:46,830 --> 01:45:49,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I like this music Ray. - Elevator stopped.

1656
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:50,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay.

1657
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:54,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think you could show me the way you were going to dance with Iris?

1658
01:45:54,670 --> 01:45:55,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes?

1659
01:45:55,910 --> 01:45:57,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you like to dance with me?

1660
01:45:57,810 --> 01:46:00,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Elevator's on hold. - It's okay. Give me this.

1661
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:06,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Show me. Show me how.

1662
01:46:06,890 --> 01:46:08,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Charlie Babbitt taught me.

1663
01:46:12,490 --> 01:46:14,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dancing in the elevator.

1664
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:16,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's nice.

1665
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:21,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're very good.

1666
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:37,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Iris missed a beautiful dance.

1667
01:46:39,850 --> 01:46:41,680

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Have you ever kissed a girl? - I don't know.

1669
01:46:46,890 --> 01:46:48,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know?

1670
01:46:50,630 --> 01:46:52,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open your mouth. Open.

1671
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:55,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like this.

1672

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like this.

1675
01:47:06,950 --> 01:47:08,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Close your eyes.

1676
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:16,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay Ray.

1677
01:47:26,330 --> 01:47:27,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How was that?

1678
01:47:27,570 --> 01:47:28,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wet.

1679
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:31,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we did it right.

1680
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:33,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Elevator's definitely stuck.

1681

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Babbitt why don't you go to that side of the table.

1809
01:57:28,770 --> 01:57:30,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Raymond right here. Have a seat.

1810
01:57:30,570 --> 01:57:32,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Raymond right here. Take this seat.

1811
01:57:32,940 --> 01:57:34,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ray put your knapsack on the floor.

1812
01:57:34,970 --> 01:57:38,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a good opportunity to be honest with one another...

1813
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:40,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ray the TV. On the floor.

1814
01:57:40,850 --> 01:57:42,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

1815
01:57:42,510 --> 01:57:45,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know any easy way to say this Mr. Babbitt...

1816
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:47,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say what? Have I lost already?

1817
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:50,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No you haven't. I'm not the judge and jury.

1818
01:57:50,260 --> 01:57:52,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a doctor making a recommendation to a court.

1819
01:57:52,820 --> 01:57:56,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I must tell you that Dr. Bruner is a very respected professional.

1820
01:57:56,330 --> 01:57:59,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Raymond's case has been meticulously documented

1821
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:02,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and Wallbrook is one of the finest institutions in this country.

1822
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:05,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've made up your mind. I'll see you in court.

1823
01:58:05,170 --> 01:58:06,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one's your enemy.

1824
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:08,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My brother came further with me in a week

1825
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}than he did with you in 20 years.

1826
01:58:10,710 --> 01:58:13,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think it's necessary to challenge Dr. Bruner.

1827
01:58:13,550 --> 01:58:14,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

1828
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:17,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly what happened this past week Raymond?

1829
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:19,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well we got... - I was asking Raymond.

1830
01:58:19,780 --> 01:58:22,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Raymond what happened this past week?

1831
01:58:23,290 --> 01:58:25,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What did you do? - Counted cards.

1832
01:58:25,190 --> 01:58:27,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Counted cards in Las Vegas.

1833
01:58:27,090 --> 01:58:31,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Your brother took you to Las Vegas? - $3000 on the wheel of fortune.

1834
01:58:31,230 --> 01:58:33,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He gave you $3000 to gamble with?

1835
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:36,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lost $3000 on pitiful 20.

1836
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:38,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What else did you do? - Bet on number 20.

1837
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:41,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What else did you do? - Danced with Charlie Babbitt.

1838
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:44,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Danced with your brother? - He wanted to learn...

1839
01:58:44,310 --> 01:58:45,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Danced with Susanna.

1840
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:48,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Kissed Susanna. - Kissed Susanna?

1841
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:49,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. In the elevator.

1842
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:51,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you enjoy kissing a woman?

1843
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:52,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

1844
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:53,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did it feel?

1845
01:58:53,850 --> 01:58:55,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It felt wet.

1846
01:58:55,090 --> 01:58:56,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wet?

1847
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:57,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quite a trip.

1848
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:02,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You enjoy being on the road? - I'm an excellent driver.

1849
01:59:02,460 --> 01:59:03,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You drove?

1850
01:59:04,660 --> 01:59:06,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your brother let you drive on the highway?

1851
01:59:06,970 --> 01:59:09,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Slow on the driveway. - He didn't drive on the highway.

1852
01:59:11,870 --> 01:59:14,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did he have any emotional outbursts? - What do you mean?

1853
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:16,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Things they tend to do.

1854
01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:18,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inflicting bodily harm on themselves...

1855
01:59:18,710 --> 01:59:21,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Okay a couple of times. - A couple of times?

1856
01:59:21,450 --> 01:59:23,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay he had what you call an outburst at the airport

1857
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:25,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because he didn't want to fly so we didn't fly.

1858
01:59:26,050 --> 01:59:27,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When was the last outburst he had?

1859
01:59:27,890 --> 01:59:30,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This morning. - This morning?

1860
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:31,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is bullshit.

1861
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:34,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could tell you anything I could tell you nothing

1862
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:35,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you'd never know.

1863
01:59:35,390 --> 01:59:37,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The smoke alarm went off.

1864
01:59:37,330 --> 01:59:39,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He got a little nervous but he's fine.

1865
01:59:39,460 --> 01:59:41,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't feel as though I'm placing any blame.

1866
01:59:41,770 --> 01:59:44,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We went out for pancakes. Look at him... he's fine.

1867
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:46,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have to be defensive.

1868
01:59:46,270 --> 01:59:48,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm being honest. - You're missing the point.

1869
01:59:48,570 --> 01:59:50,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're missing the point. I'm being truthful.

1870
01:59:50,980 --> 01:59:53,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The point is I'm not placing any blame...

1871
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:56,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had a father I hardly knew a mother I didn't know at all

1872
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:59,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I find out I have a brother and I'm supposed to give him up?

1873
01:59:59,820 --> 02:00:01,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one is saying anything.

1874
02:00:01,220 --> 02:00:03,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't hurt him he's not hurting me

1875
02:00:03,350 --> 02:00:06,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we're not hurting you so why are you interfering with my family?

1876
02:00:06,860 --> 02:00:09,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Do you understand? - I understand that.

1877
02:00:10,030 --> 02:00:11,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do have a brother

1878
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:13,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but he's not capable of having a relationship with you.

1879
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:15,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's your opinion.

1880
02:00:15,130 --> 02:00:18,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you spend 24 hours a day seven days a week with him?

1881
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:21,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You cannot take on this responsibility without professional guidance.

1882
02:00:22,010 --> 02:00:24,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's your opinion. - Yes it's my opinion.

1883
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:26,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a couple of things I'd like to go over.

1884
02:00:26,610 --> 02:00:29,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dr. Bruner states that you stole Raymond out of the institution

1885
02:00:30,010 --> 02:00:33,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're willing to trade him for $1.5 million. Is that correct?

1886
02:00:33,350 --> 02:00:36,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father died. I was upset. Okay? That was wrong.

1887
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:39,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So last week you were upset and this week you suddenly

1888
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:40,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}found some devotion to your brother

1889
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:44,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you want to take care of him the rest of your life?

1890
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:47,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So in the beginning it was like a kidnapping.

1891
02:00:48,370 --> 02:00:51,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kidnapping... that's very strong. I didn't kidnap my brother.

1892
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:53,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But in the course of the week

1893
02:00:53,070 --> 02:00:55,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you came to have an understanding with him.

1894
02:00:55,370 --> 02:00:56,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

1895
02:00:56,440 --> 02:00:58,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That... - Yes?

1896
02:00:58,740 --> 02:01:01,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lunderstand that this sounds irrational to you.

1897
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:03,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes when it started out it had...

1898
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:06,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't feel compelled to be defensive.

1899
02:01:06,120 --> 02:01:07,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can I talk? - Yes you can.

1900
02:01:07,690 --> 02:01:09,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to talk. Thank you.

1901
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:11,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no accusations.

1902
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:12,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead.

1903
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:14,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no accusations?

1904
02:01:15,830 --> 02:01:19,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to understand that when we started out together

1905
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:22,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that he was only my brother...

1906
02:01:22,270 --> 02:01:23,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in name.

02:01:49,730 --> 02:01:52,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but the purpose of this meeting is to determine
