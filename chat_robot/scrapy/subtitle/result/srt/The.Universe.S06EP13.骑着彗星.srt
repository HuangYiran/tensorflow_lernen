1
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:02,250
混沌初世，一片黑暗
male narrator: In the beginning, there was darkness,

2
00:00:02,305 --> 00:00:03,944
接着，发生爆炸
and then, bang,

3
00:00:04,453 --> 00:00:07,083
产生了无边无际的
giving birth to an endless
expanding existence

4
00:00:07,146 --> 00:00:09,222
时间、空间和物质
of time, space, and matter.

5
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:13,152
有一个地方，每天都有新发现
Every day, new discoveries are unlocking the mysterious,

6
00:00:13,194 --> 00:00:15,597
但它依然极端神秘，让人饶有兴趣
the mid-blowin, the deadly secrets

7
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:18,541
它就是宇宙
of a place we call The Unierse.

8
00:00:21,597 --> 00:00:24,416
彗星以一往无前的气概
Chart a daring course with comets,

9
00:00:24,444 --> 00:00:27,791
在宇宙里进行着漫长的旅行
the cosmic time travelers of the skies.

10
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:30,763
这些神秘物体曾被视为异兆
- These mysteious objects have been agents of change.

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,222
它们曾被认为是灾星
They've been agents of destruction.

12
00:00:33,638 --> 00:00:36,207
这些天体携带着以前的秘密
narrator: Discover why these celestial bodies

13
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:38,485
如果了解其中原因
carry secrets from our past

14
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:41,430
就可以让我们把握未来
and cast doom over our future.

15
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:44,032
如果它冲着我们而来
- If it's getting into our on-ramp,

16
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,457
我们就得提心吊胆
we need to worry about it.

17
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:47,374
除了发射巨型原子弹
- There's very little we can do

18
00:00:47,402 --> 00:00:49,582
让它们偏离方向
other than sending a giant bomb toward them

19
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,179
我们别无选择
and trying to deflect them.

20
00:00:51,874 --> 00:00:53,943
让我们迎上这些冰冷的
narrator: Brace yourself as we rendezvous

21
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,777
来自宇宙深处的不速之客
with the frozen intruders
from the great beyond

22
00:00:56,943 --> 00:00:59,888
展开壮丽的“与彗星同行”之旅
on an epic journey to "Ride the Comet."

24
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:10,501
《宇宙之与彗星同行》

25
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:15,770
它们悄然出现
They appear out of nowhere,

26
00:01:16,263 --> 00:01:19,530
缓缓地划过漆黑夜空
gliding slowly across the nighttime sky

27
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,330
然后消失在视线之外
and then disappearing from sight.

28
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:26,956
许多古文明认为
Throughout human history, ancient cultures

29
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:29,332
这些不速之客
believed these celestial intruders

30
00:01:29,545 --> 00:01:32,238
拥有上帝赋予的特殊力量
carried special powers from the gods,

31
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:37,065
蕴藏着生与死的神秘信息
mystical messengers of life and death.

32
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:38,905
科学家认为
- Scientists like to think

33
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,372
彗星相当神秘
that comets are fairly mysterious objects,

34
00:01:41,398 --> 00:01:43,654
这是因为它们非常古老
because we know that they're very old.

35
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,760
好象是来自太阳系诞生时期
They're like frozen time capsules

36
00:01:45,787 --> 00:01:48,027
把时间冻结起来的密封舱
from when our solar system was first formed.

37
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:51,480
彗星耀眼夺目
- Comets are a bit of show-offs.

38
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,336
在夜空里，来无影，去无踪
They come into the night sky unannounced, unpredicted.

39
00:01:57,536 --> 00:02:00,776
它们在中世纪被认为是
In the Middle Ages, they were thought to be fireballs

40
00:02:00,802 --> 00:02:01,976
怒火中烧的上帝
thrown at a sinful Earth

41
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:03,976
掷向罪恶地球的火球
from the right hand of an avenging god.

42
00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:09,509
被视为畏惧之物，或是诡秘的东西
And so they've always been feared or seen as mysterious.

43
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:12,871
让我们勇敢地
narrator: We're going to hitch a ride

44
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:16,458
踏上茫茫旅程，去了解太阳系里
on a bold, uncharted journey through the secret life

45
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:18,991
彗星的秘密生活
of our solar system's comets.

46
00:02:20,778 --> 00:02:24,993
我们坐着时光穿梭机
Our daring quest begins 4.5 billion years ago,

47
00:02:25,126 --> 00:02:28,246
从45亿年前太阳系诞生的时候
as our futuristic spacecraft time-travels

48
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,100
开始我们的无畏之旅
back to the birth of our solar system.

49
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,008
我们曲折地穿过碎石群
We zigzag through a maelstrom of debris

50
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:41,742
去开始研究
to catch our first glimpse of comets,

51
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:45,928
这些自由任性，不肯与行星结合的石头堆
the wayward rocks that didn't meld into planets.

52
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,382
彗星其实是肮脏的雪球
- Comets are basically dirty snowballs

53
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:50,997
或者结冰的脏球
or icy dirtballs.

54
00:02:51,157 --> 00:02:54,690
它们是由岩石、灰尘和脏东西
They consist of rocks and dust and dirt

55
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:56,664
在冰块的作用下混合而成
held together by ices-

56
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,250
冰块里包含有水、氨、甲烷和二氧化碳干冰
water ice, ammonia, methane, carbon dioxide, dry ice.

57
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:02,477
它就象是胶水
That's sort of like the glue

58
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:03,866
把小石头和尘埃
that holds all these little pebbles

59
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,852
牢牢地粘在一起
and particles of dust together.

60
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:12,119
这些冰团最主要的部分是彗核
narrator: The heart of these
cosmic icebergs is the nucleus,

61
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:15,546
彗核也叫中央核心，它们的直径
or central core, which averages in size

62
00:03:15,652 --> 00:03:20,001
有的长半英里，有的象一个现代城市这么大
from a half mile wide to as big as a modern city.

63
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,054
通过近距离观察
- One of the things we've learned

64
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:26,841
我们发现彗核
by flying close by and observing
the nuclei of comets

65
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:28,910
它们是奇怪的
is that they're these strange

66
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,603
冰和岩石的聚合物
sort of compacted conglomerates of ice and rock.

67
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,696
彼此不相同
They're not uniform.

68
00:03:33,723 --> 00:03:35,163
它们不是紧密的聚合体
They're not perfectly mixed.

69
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,990
非常粗短，形状古怪
They're quite chunky and oddly shaped.

70
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:41,563
彗核...
- The nuclei of comets are...

71
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:43,790
非常易碎
very fragile entities.

72
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,803
如果手里有一块
If you had a chunk,

73
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,685
你能轻而易举地折断它
you could probably break it
easily in your hands.

74
00:03:50,192 --> 00:03:53,498
准确来讲，与其说彗星象超大号雪球
narrator: Up close, comets look like bland chunks of charcoal

75
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,178
不如说它象大木炭
rather than supersized snowballs.

76
00:03:57,525 --> 00:03:59,338
它们与我们在漆黑天空里
They don't even remotely resemble

77
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,207
见到的发光圆形天体
the glowing orbs we see

78
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:03,274
相去甚远
in our pitch-black skies.

79
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,300
我们认为绝大多数彗星
- We think that most comets are extremely dark

80
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:09,260
其表面非常黑，覆盖着
on their surfaces, that the surfaces are covered

81
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:11,247
类似于烧烤烟灰的东西
with something kind of like barbecue soot,

82
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:13,354
这种物质黑色无光
this really dark, black material

83
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,342
让彗星非常难被观察到
that makes them very difficult to see.

84
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,169
由于它们的远亲小行星
narrator: While their asteroid cousins

85
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:21,662
也拥有类似的物质，比如岩石和金属
share similar properties, such as rock and metal,

86
00:04:22,222 --> 00:04:25,369
科学家们怀疑彗星产生于更遥远的
scientists suspect that comets
were born farther out,

87
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:27,358
毗邻着气态巨行星的地方
near the gas giant planets,

88
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:29,131
那里寒冷至极
where it's much colder,

89
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:33,504
所以它们有很多的冰和易挥发成分
so they possess more ices and volatile elements.

90
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:39,703
大约38亿年前，在寒冷的柯伊伯带
About 3.8 billion years ago, many of these icy bodies

91
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:43,940
这个与太阳系最外侧的海王星相毗邻的区域里
were whisked away to the Kuiper belt, a frigid neighborhood

92
00:04:43,953 --> 00:04:46,842
许多冰团被甩了出来
just beyond the outermost planet, Neptune.

93
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:51,986
柯伊伯带里的冰团或许会飞向太阳
- Icy objects in the Kuiper belt probably formed

94
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:54,935
但那里有许多巨型行星
closer in toward the Sun, where the giant planets are,

95
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:58,522
巨型行星们联手施加万有引力
but then gravitational interactions with those giant planets

96
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,548
从而让它们逃出了太阳的魔爪
made those icy objects migrate outward.

97
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,964
我们飞船所穿越的
narrator:
Our spacecraft navigates

98
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,337
这一片黑暗的圆盘状区域
through this dark, disklike region,

99
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,497
大约20亿英里宽
which is almost 2 billion miles wide

100
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,910
估计里面的彗星超过60亿颗
and is estimated to hold over 6 billion comets.

101
00:05:20,177 --> 00:05:25,206
我们最后降落在其中一块冰团的表面
We eventually touch down on the surface of one of these icy boulders.

102
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,832
登陆彗星相当棘手
- Landing on a comet would be a pretty tricky affair.

103
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:33,886
在肮脏的冰雪下面
So you could kind of imagine dirty snow

104
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:35,432
是气体
that's covered with exhaust,

105
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:37,208
如果在上面行走
and if you step on it, in places,

106
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:39,408
许多地方的表层不堪负荷
you can punch through to places where there's more

107
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:40,861
就会被穿透
fresh material underneath it.

108
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:43,954
柯伊伯带里的物体
narrator: The Kuiper belt objects

109
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,421
其轨道相当稳定
appear to have fairly stable orbits,

110
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:49,410
用来做顺风车没有太多意思
so they won't be that much fun to ride.

111
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,023
所以我们再次起飞
We lift off in search of a comet

112
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,010
去寻找穿越太阳系的彗星
that will cut a more exciting path

113
00:05:56,036 --> 00:05:57,570
共赴激情之旅
through our solar system.

114
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:00,970
我们飞向更遥远的
We navigate farther out

115
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:04,852
行星稀少的“离散盘”
to a sparsely populated region
called the scattered disc,

116
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:09,438
那里是冰团的家园，其轨道椭而长
which is home to icy bodies
with long, elliptical orbits.

117
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:13,972
最细微的扰动也能让这些不稳定的物体
The slightest disturbance
can send these unstable objects

118
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,345
猛冲进内太阳系
careening into the inner solar system,

119
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,560
成为我们所说的每20年至200年
where they become known as short-period comets,

120
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:25,480
环绕太阳一次的“短周期彗星”
those which orbit the Sun every 20 to 200 years.

121
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,254
那里行星稀少
- The scattered disc region

122
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,427
被认为是短周期彗星的
is thought to be the primary source

123
00:06:30,494 --> 00:06:32,016
主要发源地
of the short-period comets.

124
00:06:32,136 --> 00:06:34,589
它们之所以被踢进内太阳系
They are kicked into the inner solar system

125
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:36,562
是因为海王星或路过的天体
either by interacting with Neptune

126
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:38,842
对它们施加影响的缘故
or possibly passing stars.

127
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,578
飞船里的我们
narrator: Our spacecraft witnesses

128
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:44,431
亲眼目睹了海王星的万有引力
Neptune's gravitational influence at work,

129
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:48,791
把一颗彗星甩出了离散盘
dislodging a comet out of the scattered disc.

130
00:06:49,818 --> 00:06:52,818
登陆眼前的彗星，实在是太危险
This comet would be too dangerous to land on,

131
00:06:53,218 --> 00:06:55,151
我们只能紧跟其后
so we'll track alongside it

132
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:59,020
去一睹其穿越太阳系的新生之旅
on its transformational flight
through our solar system.

133
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,713
如果它飞向太阳，会发生什么情况？
- So what would happen if it
was on a journey toward the Sun?

134
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:07,473
一开始，它象黑色的行星
Well, it would start off looking like a dark asteroid.

135
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,286
什么都没有发生
Nothing much is happening.

136
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,528
它的周围没有大气
It doesn't have an atmosphere around it.

137
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:15,102
一到了内太阳系
- As you start to travel toward
the inner solar system,

138
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:17,888
接近木星，或是离太阳更近的时候
get up to Jupiter or even closer to the Sun,

139
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:20,515
彗星会开始变得活跃
the comet would start to become active.

140
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,675
太阳的温暖让彗星开始变热
- The warmth from the Sun
starts to heat up the comet,

141
00:07:24,915 --> 00:07:27,704
其内部的冰冻物质
and all the frozen material
that's trapped on the inside

142
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,344
开始从冰转化为气态
starts to convert from ice into gaseous material,

143
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,970
穿透彗星的外层
and so these gas jets can actually punch through

144
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:36,410
形成喷射气流
the crust of the comet and form jets.

145
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,997
喷射气流离开表面时
As these jets flow away from the surface,

146
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:41,679
会把尘埃和石头一起冲出
they can start to pull dust and rocks with them,

147
00:07:41,772 --> 00:07:45,066
形成了笼罩彗核的烟雾
and this forms a kind of hazy atmosphere around the comet's nucleus.

148
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:46,906
我们称之为“彗发”
We call this the coma.

149
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,519
从地球上观测
narrator: As it zooms by Earth,

150
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:52,599
彗发会渐渐变得
the coma of a comet can grow to be larger

151
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:54,908
比太阳的直径还要大
than the diameter of our Sun.

152
00:07:56,428 --> 00:07:59,961
最后，太阳辐射把光环加在彗核后面
Solar radiation eventually pushes this cosmic halo

153
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:03,894
形成两条明亮的尾巴
behind the nucleus, forming two bright tails:

154
00:08:04,148 --> 00:08:07,803
一条尘埃的，一条气体的
one of dust and the other of gas.

155
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,576
尾巴将会越长越大
- There will be a tail growing
and growing and growing,

156
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,683
而紧随其后的你
and you would eventually become engulfed

157
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:17,550
被包裹在夹杂尘埃的石头和冰块当中
in just a really rocky, icy, particle-filled environment.

158
00:08:17,576 --> 00:08:19,883
你的飞船将难以飞行
It would be very difficult on your spacecraft

159
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:22,725
就好象是在暴风雪中穿梭
because it'd be like flying through a blizzard.

160
00:08:24,698 --> 00:08:28,418
有些尾巴会延伸至1亿英里长
narrator: Some tails can stretch for 100 million miles,

161
00:08:28,472 --> 00:08:31,578
这意味着，在朝太阳进发的时候
more than the distance between the Sun and the Earth,

162
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:34,247
彗尾比太阳和地球的间距还要长
as it travels towards our home star.

163
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:38,540
这是太阳系里最壮丽的奇观之一
It's one of the most spectacular
spectacles of our solar system.

164
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,140
现在，我们一起看看
- Today we're going to see what happens

165
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:44,940
如果让位于寒冷、漆黑的太阳系外围
when we take a comet that's been in the cold, dark,
icy outer reaches

166
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:46,207
被冰封的彗星
of the solar system,

167
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:48,862
向着近日点，即是最接近太阳的点逼近
and we're going to send it
inward towards its perihelion,

168
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:51,209
会发生什么情况
or the point of closest approach to the Sun.

169
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:53,889
干冰是冰冻的二氧化碳
Now, dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide,

170
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,902
它是彗星非常普遍的成份
and this is a very common constituent of comets.

171
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:58,236
请注意了
Let's see what happens.

172
00:08:58,276 --> 00:08:59,849
我们把干冰
When we take this piece of dry ice,

173
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:01,864
放进温暖的水中
and we drop it into the warm water,

174
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:03,744
它开始升华
the dry ice starts
to sublimate.

175
00:09:03,784 --> 00:09:06,678
这说明它直接从冻结的固态
That means it converts directly
from a solid, frozen state

176
00:09:06,704 --> 00:09:08,171
转变为气态
into a gaseous state.

177
00:09:08,344 --> 00:09:10,598
而由于干冰的某些部分
And as the water starts to warm up

178
00:09:10,624 --> 00:09:12,638
首先被水加热
certain parts of the dry ice first,

179
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:15,746
所以开始出现微小的喷射流
you can start to see that
little jets kind of form on it,

180
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:18,880
形成了被称为“彗发”的雾气
and this forms a hazy atmosphere called a coma.

181
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,773
在升华的过程中
You can see that the little chips of dry ice

182
00:09:21,786 --> 00:09:24,626
干冰小碎片不停地变化着
are constantly changing as they sublimate away.

183
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,840
时而加速
Sometimes they speed up.

184
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,266
时而慢下来
Sometimes they slow down.

185
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:28,935
所以，如果它是彗星
So if this was a comet,

186
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:32,042
你能想象得到，当彗星接近太阳
you can get the idea that,
as the comet approaches the Sun,

187
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:34,295
不稳定的物质会开始蒸发
and the volatiles start to vaporize,

188
00:09:34,348 --> 00:09:36,508
彗星的运行状态会发生改变
this can actually change the comet's rotational state

189
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,212
甚至轨道也会改变
and even its orbit.

190
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:42,508
在最靠近太阳的时候
narrator: Comets are brightest and fastest

191
00:09:42,535 --> 00:09:44,364
彗星最明亮，最快
when they're closest to the Sun.

192
00:09:45,137 --> 00:09:48,324
太阳的灼热和巨大的万有引力
The searing heat and immense
gravity of our mother star

193
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,470
可以让彗星加速至
can accelerate a comet's speed

194
00:09:50,697 --> 00:09:53,817
每小时将近2百万英里
to nearly 2 million miles per hour.

195
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:57,129
太阳使它的速度大幅增加
- The speed increases a lot,
and it whips around the Sun,

196
00:09:57,157 --> 00:09:59,143
而且越来越快
so it goes zoom, like that,

197
00:09:59,393 --> 00:10:02,615
如同一辆冲向低处的巨型过山车
like being propelled at the bottom of a giant roller coaster.

198
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,976
过山车刚从高处下落时，非常慢
A roller coaster starts out high, very slowly,

199
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:08,379
重力作用使它速度加快
picks up speed due to the gravity,

200
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,601
风驰电掣地通过低处
goes zooming past the bottom,

201
00:10:10,656 --> 00:10:13,795
然后又再次慢下来
and then slows down again
on its outward journey.

202
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,087
彗星最终会离太阳而去
- Eventually, as our comet leaves the vicinity of the Sun,

203
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:21,328
返回到遥远的太阳系深处，继续不变的旅程
it's going to travel back out into the far reaches of the solar system.

204
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:23,004
一切会平息下来
Everything's going to quiet down.

205
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:26,170
所有的气体和尘埃将重新沉积回表面
All of the gas and dust is going to settle back onto its surface.

206
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:28,876
最后，整个彗星将没入宁静的黑暗中
And eventually, it'll cruise away into the quiet dark.

207
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,420
彗星回到寒冷的离散盘
narrator: Back in the cold region of the scattered disc,

208
00:10:35,503 --> 00:10:37,017
再次变成
a comet transforms

209
00:10:37,045 --> 00:10:40,225
晦暗无光的石头和冰
back into a dull, black lump of rock and ice

210
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:43,985
直到它再次去环绕太阳
until it makes its journey around the Sun once again.

211
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:50,878
哈雷是最著名的短周期彗星
Haley, the most famous short-period comet,

212
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:53,880
每76年经过地球一次
was first recorded in 240.C.

213
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:57,850
在公元前240年被首次记录下来
and has passed by Earth every 76 years.

214
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,086
家喻户晓的它
Estimated to be the size of Manhattan,

215
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:04,239
估计有曼哈顿那么大，非常明亮
this superstar comet is sometimes so bright,

216
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:06,749
在大白天也能看到
it has been seen in broad daylight.

217
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:09,697
在历史上
Throughout history,

218
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:13,239
哈雷的出现都会引起
the appearance of Haley has inspired awe and dread

219
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:15,475
地球人的敬畏和恐惧
among earthly observers.

220
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,711
在1910年，人们为此惊恐万分
- In 1910, it was feared,

221
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:21,378
刚创立不久的光谱学
because spectroscopy had just been introduced,

222
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:24,964
让人们认为，彗星含有氰
and they had determined that comets contain cyanogen,

223
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:28,124
氰是一种无臭的有毒气体
which is an odorless and poisonous gas,

224
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:30,818
所以天文学家预测，这种毒气
and so astronomers predicted that there'd be problems

225
00:11:30,844 --> 00:11:32,980
扫过地球时会带来麻烦
because of this poisonous gas sweeping the Earth,

226
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:36,020
给人类造成浩劫
and so there were actually
comet pills manufactured.

227
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:39,180
当时的保险就删除了有关彗星的内容
Life insurance policies on the comet were taken out.

228
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:43,460
在彗星被认为是
narrator: While comets have been thought to be

229
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:45,953
天外死亡预言的同时
extraterrestrial harbingers of doom,

230
00:11:46,353 --> 00:11:49,808
天文学家思考着，是否这些发光的石头
astronomers have long wondered if these glowing rocks

231
00:11:49,822 --> 00:11:53,835
蕴藏着关于我们过去的珍贵信息
contain precious information about our past.

232
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,675
在21世纪，美国航天局 (NASA) 筹划了
By the 21st century, NASA was ready to ignite

233
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:02,117
一次异常大胆的撞击
a bold offensive strike,

234
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,344
希望可以对
one that would hopefully expose

235
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:08,037
被誉为行星科学终极目标之一的彗星进行揭秘
one of the holy grails of planetary science.

236
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:11,250
这些星际流浪者
Could these interplanetary vagabonds

237
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:14,226
曾经是宇宙生命的传递者吗？
have been the cosmic transporters of life?

238
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:23,186
迄今为止，我们与彗星一起
So far, we've traveled with comets

239
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:27,241
从寒冷、偏远的柯伊伯带和离散盘出发
from the frozen hinterlands of the Kuiper belt and scattered disc

240
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:30,721
飞赴激情的环绕太阳之旅
to an exhilarating orbit around the Sun.

241
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:33,921
在它形成明亮的彗发和彗尾的时候
We've watched these dark bodies come alive

242
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:37,441
我们看到了彗星爆发的活力
as they formed brilliant comas and tails.

243
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,041
但科学家们仍然
But scientists are still puzzled

244
00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:44,576
对彗星内部有什么东西，感到困惑
about what's really inside these cosmic interlopers.

245
00:12:45,936 --> 00:12:48,683
我希望了解彗星内部
- Man, I wish I knew what the interior of a comet looked like.

246
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:52,656
很想看到彗核里的东西
You would love to be able
to look inside the nucleus of a comet,

247
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:55,885
看看是不是块状，是不是千篇一律
to see if it's clumpy, if it's uniform.

248
00:12:56,312 --> 00:12:57,712
有结晶的冰吗？
Is there crystalline ice?

249
00:12:57,738 --> 00:12:59,432
有玻璃状的冰吗？
Is there glassy ice?

250
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:06,845
我们的神奇飞船
narrator: Our protective spacecraft

251
00:13:06,872 --> 00:13:09,687
穿越时空，回到2005年
time-travels back to 2005

252
00:13:10,194 --> 00:13:13,674
与NASA执行撞击彗星任务的
and meets up with NASA's Deep Impact space probe

253
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,540
“深度撞击号”相会
on a comet-hunting mission.

254
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:21,060
它撞击的目标
It zeroes in on a short-period comet named Tempel 1

255
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:23,529
是坦普尔1号短周期彗星
with an aggressive plan of attack.

256
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,942
深度撞击号向擦肩而过的彗星
We hover at a safe distance as Deep Impact

257
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:33,862
发射了一个800磅重的撞击器
launches an 800-pound projectile into the passing comet.

258
00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:40,384
撞击器轰出一个弹坑
Debris sprays out for thousands of miles

259
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:43,024
碎片飞溅数千英里高
as the impactor excavates a crater

260
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:48,424
数以吨计的气体、岩石和尘埃被抛入太空
and sends tons of blinding gas, rocks, and dust into space.

261
00:13:48,918 --> 00:13:50,893
在人类历史上
or the first time in history,

262
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:53,800
这或许是科学家首次能够
scientists are able to peer inside

263
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:57,146
仔细观察彗星内部的冰封世界
the icy, muddy interior of a comet.

264
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,853
在撞击后
- Right after the impact,

265
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:02,786
硅酸盐颗粒强烈反光，极为明亮
you could see silicate grains fluorescing and glowing.

266
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:06,162
这就说明，彗星是非常原始
This tells us that comets are very primitive material

267
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:09,228
它们让物质基本保持了
and that they pretty much do preserve in pristine state

268
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:12,735
恒星形成最初期的原始状态
the materials that we find
in the youngest star-forming systems.

269
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:15,522
所以，它们是时间的密封舱
So indeed, they really are time capsules

270
00:14:15,548 --> 00:14:17,777
能让我们追溯到
that let us look back on our own solar system

271
00:14:17,804 --> 00:14:19,297
太阳系的最早期
at the very beginning.

272
00:14:22,377 --> 00:14:23,550
在深度撞击号
narrator: While Deep Impact

273
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:26,497
对彗星内部一窥究竟的时候
captures a rare glimpse of a comet's interior,

274
00:14:27,244 --> 00:14:30,364
由于碎片太多太细，景象模糊不清
it is unable to snap clear images of the crater,

275
00:14:30,657 --> 00:14:34,299
它未能得到清晰的弹坑照片
which was obscured by an enormous plume of debris.

276
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:39,446
在2011年2月
In February 2011,

277
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:42,566
另一艘宇宙飞船"星尘-延续任务号"
another spacecraft, named Stardust-NExT,

278
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:44,379
追赶上五年绕太阳一次的
catches up to Tempel 1

279
00:14:44,472 --> 00:14:47,968
坦普尔1号彗星
as it completes its five-year orbit around the Sun.

280
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:52,808
让每个人都吃惊的是
To everyone's surprise,

281
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:56,634
五年前历史性的撞击
the impact crater is much
smaller than had been expected

282
00:14:56,661 --> 00:15:00,290
所留下的弹坑比预料的小得多
from the historic smash-up that
occurred five years earlier.

283
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,703
真奇怪...
- Amazing...

284
00:15:02,956 --> 00:15:05,170
弹坑看起来比较小
But the crater looked like it was small.

285
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,970
由此引发了一个争议
So this now creates this issue:

286
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:08,930
弹坑总是这么小吗？
Was the crater always small?

287
00:15:09,036 --> 00:15:12,038
弹坑与我们预想的不同
We know the crater isn't what we expected.

288
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:14,692
所以要进行一些实验
So we're going to do some experiments

289
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:18,572
看看能否解释个中原因
to see if we can explain why
the crater looks like it does.

290
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:20,065
太阳灯来了
- Sunlamp's coming on.

291
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:22,665
可以上移一点吗？
- Can we move it up a bit?

292
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:26,854
在NASA的艾姆斯垂直射击靶场
narrator: At NASA's Ames Vertical Gun Range,

293
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:30,360
"星尘-延续任务"的负责人皮特.舒尔茨
Stardust-NExT coinvestigator Pete Schultz

294
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:33,720
正在安排高速撞击试验，以便弄明白
is conducting high-velocity impact experiments

295
00:15:33,907 --> 00:15:38,094
深度撞击号留下的弹坑怎么那么小
to find out why Deep Impact produced such a tiny crater.

296
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:43,642
他将会用一支巨大的点30口径高速气枪
He will use a massive .30-caliber high-velocity gas gun

297
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:47,536
发射细小的子弹
to fire tiny projectile beads at various targets

298
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:50,336
打向真空室里的目标
located inside a vacuum chamber.

299
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:57,271
我们正试图模拟
- We're trying to simulate

300
00:15:57,551 --> 00:16:01,231
9P/Tempel 1 彗星的真实表面
what the nature of the surface
of comet 9P/Tempel 1 is like,

301
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:02,964
所以我们放入珍珠岩
so we're putting in perlite,

302
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:05,404
这种低密度的园林材料
which is this low-density material
that you find in gardens,

303
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,460
再加入中空的小球粒
then we're adding in hollow microspheres,

304
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:11,846
让它更加类似于真实的彗星表面
and this also resemble what
the nature of the comet is like.

305
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,273
实验的目的是
The purpose of the experiment is to see what happens

306
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,926
观察弹坑的形成
to the crater after formation.

307
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,033
会有弹坑吗？它会坍塌吗？
Does it stay there? Does it collapse?

308
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:21,542
实验之后，将真相大白
With this experiment, we should be able to find out.

309
00:16:22,688 --> 00:16:24,235
好了，我走出箱子了
Okay, I'm out of the tank.

310
00:16:24,262 --> 00:16:25,555
准备开始
Lock and load.

311
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:29,355
高速摄影机遍布真空室四周
narrator: High-speed cameras mounted around the vacuum chamber

312
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:31,462
将对撞击进行记录
will document the impact.

313
00:16:31,835 --> 00:16:33,248
我们象离弦的箭
- We've got this one covered.

314
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:35,837
只能命中目标
We just have to hit the target.

315
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,610
好了
Okay.

316
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,757
让我们动手吧
Let's shoot this puppy.

317
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:41,904
J.P.，好了吗？
J.P., are you ready?

318
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,024
好了
- Yeah.

319
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:47,919
焦急等待的时候
narrator: As the crew anxiously awaits in the control room,

320
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:51,532
皮特做出了一个迷信的举动
Pete mixes science with a little superstition.

321
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:53,612
风险始终存在
- There's always a risk.

322
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,812
有时会失败，有时会成功
Sometimes you miss. Sometimes you hit.

323
00:17:02,441 --> 00:17:03,588
噢，天哪
- Oh, sweet.

324
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:06,361
它塌了下来
The whole thing sort of collapses in on itself.

325
00:17:06,388 --> 00:17:07,801
变小了
It's getting smaller now.

326
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:09,788
开始大，现在小
It was bigger. Now it's getting smaller.

327
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:13,748
许多尘埃和喷射物飞溅起来
So what we see here is that
there's a lot of dust and ejecta

328
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:16,590
填充了弹坑
sent upwards, and that blocked the view.

329
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:18,416
弹坑不成样子
We couldn't see the crater forming.

330
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:21,230
因此，美丽的弹坑在眨眼间
So what started off being a nice-looking crater,

331
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:22,563
不见了
it just doesn't stay there.

332
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:24,016
它自我恢复了
It just simply heals itself.

333
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,670
所以，9P/Tempel 1彗星可能也是如此
So what may have happened for 9P/Tempel 1,

334
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:31,392
对弹坑进行了自我恢复
the nucleus, is that that crater healed itself.

335
00:17:31,432 --> 00:17:34,498
也就是说，彗核自我治愈了
The nucleus healed itself from the scar created

336
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:36,592
深度撞击号带来的创伤
by us with Deep Impact.

337
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:38,352
让我们去看看
Let's see what we did.

338
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,034
这个结果很奇怪
So the results were fantastic.

339
00:17:46,154 --> 00:17:48,554
我们检查了原来的计划
We got to see just what we planned to.

340
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:50,274
发现不是这么简单
There may be more to the story,

341
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,900
所以还要做另一个不同的实验
so we're going to try a different experiment as well.

342
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:55,607
皮特有一个预感
narrator: Pete has a hunch

343
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:58,729
深度撞击任务有疏漏之处
there's a missing piece to the Deep Impact mission.

344
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:01,889
他现在想知道，航天探测器
He now wants to see if the space probe

345
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:05,182
是否因为坦普尔1号核心的构造
created a different type of crater on Tempel 1,

346
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:08,609
而产生一个不同类型的弹坑
due to the makeup of the comet's nucleus.

347
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:11,784
眼下，我们将在
- So this time, we're going to put

348
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:16,291
珍珠岩下面放一层密度大的东西
a denser layer below that perlite,

349
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:18,611
去确认一下
so we want to find out whether or not

350
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:20,198
能否得到一个不同类型的弹坑
we'll get a different type of crater

351
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,731
如果我们使用上软下密
if we have two different types of material:

352
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:27,000
这两种不同类型的材料的话
one very soft on top and one denser on the bottom.

353
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,306
皮特和队员回到控制室观察
narrator: Pete and his crew return to the control room

354
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,346
底下铺着厚厚一层沙子的珍珠岩
to see what happens to the new target of perlite

355
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,666
这个新靶子
poured over a heavier layer of sand.

356
00:18:44,162 --> 00:18:47,415
这次在珍珠岩上形成了一个大弹坑
Now, that formed a big crater in the perlite.

357
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,093
请仔细看
Boy, look at that.

358
00:18:49,748 --> 00:18:53,510
噢，哥们，太棒了
Oh, oh, man, that is gorgeous.

359
00:18:53,937 --> 00:18:54,897
好
Okay.

360
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,924
子弹钻进深处
The projectile went deep,

361
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,790
击起了无数的碎片
and now the stuff is coming back out that hole,

362
00:18:59,977 --> 00:19:03,190
向洞外四处飞溅
while, on the surface, it's excavating debris.

363
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:06,246
砰！好！
Pow! Okay.

364
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,872
双层靶子产生的不是一个
narrator: The double-layered target created not one

365
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,566
而是两个弹坑
but two craters,

366
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:14,828
小的弹坑是在大而浅的弹坑内部
a small crater inside a larger, shallower crater.

367
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:18,828
在9P/Tempel 1彗星上也会如此
- This could be what happened for 9P/Tempel 1.

368
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:21,328
射弹钻进彗核很深的地方
It went so deep into the nucleus,

369
00:19:21,842 --> 00:19:25,050
然后引起坍塌
and then it just simply collapses away,

370
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:27,842
我们在外面只能看到非常不起眼的圆环
and we're left with just this very, very faint rim

371
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,800
其中心也只是一个小凹点
on the outside with a small pit in the center.

372
00:19:31,731 --> 00:19:33,300
这些撞击实验
narrator: These impact experiments

373
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:37,258
为研究坦普尔1号彗星提供了意外的线索
yield surprising clues about the interior of Tempel 1

374
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,217
甚至可能适用于所有的彗星
and perhaps all comets.

375
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,842
彗星历史悠久
- Now we know that comets have history.

376
00:19:43,328 --> 00:19:44,578
由不同的层组成
We see layers.

377
00:19:44,606 --> 00:19:46,925
但我不清楚彗核
I don't know if these layers go all the way

378
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:48,592
是通体如一
through the nucleus,

379
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:50,717
还是各层相互不同？
or are they only in one part?

380
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:53,897
解开彗星内部之迷
narrator: Unraveling the secrets

381
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:57,411
将有助于科学家去了解
of what's inside comets will help scientists understand

382
00:19:57,439 --> 00:20:00,911
是什么使得它们行为怪异
what causes them to exhibit some really bizarre behavior.

384

我们的飞船追随着EPOXI任务的步伐
（注：太阳系外行星观测与深度撞击扩展研究）
Our spaceship now shadows NASA's EPOXI mission

385
00:20:12,105 --> 00:20:14,147
去与哈特利2号见面
as it encounters Hartley 2,

386
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:18,049
那是一颗快速旋转的彗星
a fast-spinning comet that tumbles through space

387
00:20:18,077 --> 00:20:20,952
好象一颗在太空里不停翻转的花生
like a hyperactive cosmic peanut.

388
00:20:21,758 --> 00:20:23,244
哈特利2号比较小
- Hartley 2 is a smaller comet.

389
00:20:23,272 --> 00:20:25,161
直径只有大约一英里
It's only about a mile or so across,

390
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:27,771
因此它异常活跃
and so it's kind of a surprise that it's so active.

391
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,549
它喷射出大量的二氧化碳和氰气流
It's putting off huge amounts of CO2 and, actually, cyanide gas.

392
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:34,174
但问题是，是所有小彗星都如此活跃
And the question is, are all small comets active like this

393
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:35,271
还是少数？
or only a few?

394
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:37,355
还有，是什么让它们如此活跃？
And what makes them so active?

395
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:42,146
这里有一个小塑料瓶
I've got a peanut-shaped plastic bottle here

396
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,563
假设它是哈特利2号
that's supposed to represent comet Hartley 2.

397
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,646
它里面装满了干冰和热水
It's full of dry ice and warm water,

398
00:20:46,674 --> 00:20:47,618
可以看到
and as you can see,

399
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,202
热水开始让干冰升华
as the warm water starts to make the dry ice sublimate,

400
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:51,771
并从瓶子上的洞
it shoots out these jets

401
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,660
喷射出气流
through the holes that
we've got poked in the bottle.

402
00:20:53,743 --> 00:20:55,382
如果我把它放到水里
If I drop it into the water,

403
00:20:55,438 --> 00:20:57,340
不再用手拿着
instead of holding it fixed in space,

404
00:20:57,577 --> 00:20:59,299
喷射气流会立即让瓶子
you can see that the jets actually start

405
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:00,521
发生旋转
pushing the bottle around,

406
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:02,938
这就是彗星运行状态改变的原因
causing the comet's rotational state to change.

407
00:21:02,965 --> 00:21:06,257
它非常类似于哈特利2号的情形
This is very similar to what's going on
on the surface of comet Hartley 2.

408
00:21:06,438 --> 00:21:09,618
二氧化碳喷射流改变了彗星的运行
The CO2 jets are actually changing the rotational state

409
00:21:09,646 --> 00:21:12,354
导致它时快时慢
of the comet, causing it
to speed up and slow down.

410
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,076
跟踪哈特利2号的时候
narrator: When tracking Hartley 2,

411
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:20,660
我们的飞船遇上了宇宙里的暴风雪
our spacecraft gets caught in a cosmic blizzard

412
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:24,118
这颗彗星神经质地喷出冰冻的雪球
as the spastic comet burps and belches out

413
00:21:24,146 --> 00:21:29,521
在宇宙间绵延数百万英里
a trail of frozen snowballs that
extend for millions of miles.

414
00:21:30,771 --> 00:21:32,534
哈特利2号带来的惊奇之一
- One of the big surprises about Hartley 2

415
00:21:32,562 --> 00:21:36,437
是环绕着它的一群微型彗星
is that it was surrounded by this posse of mini comets.

416
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,687
那是喷发出来的冰雪球
This is simply ices that are coming off,

417
00:21:39,937 --> 00:21:42,826
尺寸甚至有篮球这样大
about the size of a snowball
all the way up to a basketball.

418
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:46,826
科学家怀疑这些雪球大小的碎块
narrator: Scientists suspect the snowball-sized debris

419
00:21:46,854 --> 00:21:49,326
下雨般回落到哈特利2号上
rains back down on Hartley 2,

420
00:21:49,812 --> 00:21:54,409
形成弹坑和高峰无数的奇异景观
producing its unusual landscape of craters and towering spires.

421
00:21:55,756 --> 00:21:57,951
这些彗星的引力非常小
- Because these comets have very little gravities,

422
00:21:57,978 --> 00:21:59,881
绝大多数气体被刮进了宇宙
most of the gas is blown out into space,

423
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:02,825
只有非常少的一部分再沉积回表面
but a very small fraction can actually redeposit

424
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:05,839
在那里形成非常平滑的结构
on the surface, generating very smooth textures,

425
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,325
而在其它的地方，或是坑洼不平
and on other locations, generating these very bumpy

426
00:22:08,353 --> 00:22:10,020
或是高峰林立
or spire-like texture.

427
00:22:10,423 --> 00:22:11,839
告别了哈特利2号
narrator: From Hartley 2,

428
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:15,909
我们向太阳系的最外沿进发
we blast off to the extreme outer edge of our solar system,

429
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:18,978
那里空旷阴森
a vast, eerie place,

430
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:22,242
太阳的万有引力鞭长莫及
barely within the gravitational grasp of our Sun

431
00:22:22,603 --> 00:22:26,367
即使凭借现代化的望远镜，也难以看到
and impossible to see, even with modern telescopes.

432
00:22:27,645 --> 00:22:30,422
我们在银河邻居这里
Here, we come upon the largest

433
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,992
已经邂逅了
and perhaps most elusive

434
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:35,728
最大的、可能是最不可捉摸的冰团
icy bodies in our galactic neighborhood.

435
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:43,756

00:22:44,061 --> 00:22:47,103
迷人的彗星世界
Our journey through the fascinating world of comets

437
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,130
给我们的旅程增添了无限惊喜
has provided us a ringside seat to some of the greatest

438
00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:55,116
让我们欣赏到了不少精彩的宇宙表演秀
cosmic shows observed from Earth and space.

439
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:02,130
我们现在改变航线
We now change course and travel

440
00:23:02,158 --> 00:23:06,505
去跨越比地球到太阳还远5万倍的距离
over 50,000 times the distance between Earth and the Sun

441
00:23:06,713 --> 00:23:10,033
奔向我们太阳系的最外沿
to the outermost edge of our solar system.

442
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:13,866
我们抵达了奥尔特云
We arrive at the Oort cloud,

443
00:23:13,963 --> 00:23:16,810
一个非常大的彗星云集地
an even larger fraternity of comets,

444
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:19,310
其数量可能超过一万亿个
perhaps over a trillion of them.

445
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:22,644
如果我们的飞船
- If we'd actually got in a spaceship

446
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:25,185
想游览整个奥尔特云
and tried to go out and, say, visit the Oort cloud,

447
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,491
那将会是一段漫长旅程
this would have been a long journey.

448
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,755
那里的物体不可计数
There's billions and billions of these objects,

449
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,755
彼此间相隔遥远
and there's a lot of space in between them.

450
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:39,713
与柯伊伯带和离散盘相似
narrator: Like the Kuiper belt and scattered disc,

451
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:43,685
奥尔特云物体和太阳的形成时间可能很接近
the Oort cloud objects may have formed closer to the Sun,

452
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:48,713
但在太阳系形成大约8亿年后
but about 800 million years after the solar system was formed,

453
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:52,824
气态巨行星的引力
the gravitational influence of the gas giant planets

454
00:23:53,213 --> 00:23:54,393
把这些彗星
flung these comets

455
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:57,268
扔到了寒冷的太阳系外沿
out to the frigid edge of our solar system.

456
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:02,657
一些物体以非常椭的轨道，被往外扔到了
- Some of these objects were flung
into very highly elliptical orbits

457
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:03,963
奥尔特云
out into the Oort cloud.

458
00:24:04,074 --> 00:24:06,199
路过的星体使它们的轨道变圆
Passing stars could circularize those orbits,

459
00:24:06,226 --> 00:24:08,893
并让它们在一定程度上稳定下来
making somewhat stable orbits for them.

460
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,726
大多数奥尔特云物体
narrator: Most of the Oort cloud bodies

461
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:13,435
自从太阳系诞生之后
have been in frozen hibernation

462
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:15,810
一直处在寒冷的冬眠世界里
since the birth of our solar system.

463
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,698
只有在轨道受到影响的时候
They only become long-period comets

464
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:21,365
它们才会变成长周期彗星
when they get sucked into orbits

465
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:25,240
冲向太阳系内的行星和太阳
that carry them inward towards the planets and the Sun.

466
00:24:27,087 --> 00:24:29,143
科学家们还没有得到过
Scientists have never actually captured

467
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:30,712
奥尔特云的影像
an image of the Oort cloud,

468
00:24:31,143 --> 00:24:33,976
但他们很有理由相信它在那里
but they have good reason to believe it's there.

469
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,462
即使距离太远，看起来模糊不清
- Even though scientists can't
directly observe the Oort cloud

470
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,879
科学家不能直接研究奥尔特云
because it's so far away and so faint,

471
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:42,504
但他们能够推断它的存在
what they are able to do is infer its existence

472
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:43,629
因为我们能研究
because we can look at

473
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:46,740
那些从四面八方游弋而来的
where all these long-period comets come from on the sky,

474
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:48,656
长周期彗星
and they seem to come from all different directions.

475
00:24:48,684 --> 00:24:51,489
它们到来的方向不太一样
There doesn't really seem to be
a preferred direction for them.

476
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:53,364
这就说明奥尔特云很可能
This suggests that the Oort cloud,

477
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:56,031
大致是圆的，如果它存在的话
if it exists, is probably roughly spherical.

478
00:24:58,406 --> 00:25:00,170
一个巨大的疑问是
narrator: One of the big mysteries

479
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:03,350
到底是什么东西横蛮地撞击这些冰团
is what knocks these icy bodies off course

480
00:25:03,614 --> 00:25:07,225
让它们游弋到了地球附近
and sends them cruising by our neighborhood of Earth.

481
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:13,281
奥尔特云的彗星很容易受到太阳系外
- The comets in the Oort cloud are very susceptible
to gravitational pulls from other things

482
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:14,934
其它物体引力的影响
outside the solar system.

483
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:16,975
其中一种是路过的星体
One thing is passing stars.

484
00:25:17,003 --> 00:25:20,003
如果一个星体碰巧靠近太阳
If a star happens to come close to our Sun,

485
00:25:20,058 --> 00:25:23,545
它会把彗星从奥尔特云外围驱散
it can scatter comets from the outer Oort cloud.

486
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:28,378
在太阳系经过银河系某一颗行星时
- Icy objects in the Oort cloud can also be dislodged

487
00:25:28,517 --> 00:25:30,836
奥尔特云的冰团
by gravitational perturbations that occur

488
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:33,655
会因为受到引力而发生移动
when the solar system goes
through the plane of our galaxy.

489
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,086
太阳系主要围绕银河系中心运转
So the solar system is basically orbiting
around the center of our galaxy,

490
00:25:37,128 --> 00:25:39,336
但它也会周期性地往上或往下
but it's also oscillating up and down,

491
00:25:39,447 --> 00:25:41,155
当它经过某一颗行星时
and when it goes through the plane,

492
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:44,308
万有引力会扰动奥尔特云物体
then gravitational interactions can perturb objects

493
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:47,377
进入到内太阳系
from the Oort cloud into the inner solar system.

494
00:25:48,586 --> 00:25:50,419
一些长周期彗星
narrator: Some long-period comets

495
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:52,836
需要花费大约三千万年
take up to about 30 million years

496
00:25:52,864 --> 00:25:55,822
才能完成绕太阳一周
to complete one round trip around the Sun.

497
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,211
我们的飞船尾随着
Our spacecraft tracks a long-period comet

498
00:26:02,238 --> 00:26:04,724
一颗长周期彗星长途跋涉
for hundreds of thousands of miles

499
00:26:04,752 --> 00:26:07,349
来到了地球的附近
until we approach planet Earth.

500
00:26:08,794 --> 00:26:10,877
随着它张开冰冷的尾巴
As its icy tails unfurl,

501
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:13,433
一阵尘埃和冰雪
a layer of dust and ice zips through

502
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,308
在地球稀薄的大气里尖啸
our planet's thin atmosphere,

503
00:26:15,655 --> 00:26:19,030
人们把这种景象称为流星雨
Leaving visible trails known as a meteor shower.

504
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,391
我认为
- I like to think of comets

505
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:25,391
彗星相当于太阳系的猪窝
as sort of the pigpens of the solar system,

506
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,377
在绕行太阳的时候
because, as they orbit around the Sun,

507
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:29,585
留下了大量凌乱的残渣
they leave a big, messy trail of debris.

508
00:26:29,613 --> 00:26:31,696
当地球横穿过其中一些尘埃团
But sometimes the Earth's orbit can intersect some of these dust bands,

510
00:26:33,363 --> 00:26:36,488
我们就能看到流星雨的出现
and when it does, we can sometimes see meteor showers.

511
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:38,390
这些划破夜空
Those beautiful bright streaks of light

512
00:26:38,418 --> 00:26:40,029
美丽耀眼的光芒
that you see coming through the night sky

513
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,488
其实只是
are actually produced by particles

514
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:43,960
砂粒般大小的颗粒所产生的
that are most often no bigger than a sand grain.

515
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:48,821
随着不断研究
narrator: While long- and short-period comets

516
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:51,557
各种长短周期彗星
make up the bulk of comets
that have been observed,

517
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:55,876
有新证据表明，不是所有的冰团
new evidence suggests that not all icy bodies

518
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:59,654
都来自于太阳系里零下温度的地方
come from the subzero suburbs of our solar system.

519
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:02,835
有一些是偷偷地躲藏在
Some have secretly taken up residence

520
00:27:02,862 --> 00:27:04,932
非常暖和的区域里
in a much warmer neighborhood.

521
00:27:09,876 --> 00:27:12,029
科学家们现在已发现
Scientists have now discovered

522
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:15,779
在木星和火星之间的小行星带里
there are comets masquerading as asteroids

523
00:27:15,973 --> 00:27:20,668
存在着伪装成小行星的彗星
in the asteroid belt, located between Jupiter and Mars.

524
00:27:23,695 --> 00:27:27,320
主带彗星的产生只有一个原因
- The only reason that we've discovered these main-belt comets

525
00:27:27,334 --> 00:27:28,765
那就是在偶然间
is because, occasionally,

526
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:32,695
太阳温暖的射线进入彗星内核
the warming rays of the Sun get into the interior,

527
00:27:32,848 --> 00:27:34,362
使冰块汽化
vaporize the ices,

528
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:37,473
彗星不一会就突然爆裂
and so the comet just bursts forth for a while,

529
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:41,917
然后它们重新成为不活跃的物体或者小行星
and then they go back to being inactive objects or asteroids.

530
00:27:43,181 --> 00:27:45,903
科学家以前曾认为，行星和彗星
- Scientists used to think that there were strong distinctions

531
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:47,653
有很大的差别
between asteroids and comets

532
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:50,375
它们是两种完全不同的物体
and that they were two totally different types of objects,

533
00:27:50,584 --> 00:27:52,070
但现在人们发现
but what we're finding nowadays is,

534
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:54,820
一些行星具有象彗星一样的特性
there are some asteroids that have comet-like properties,

535
00:27:54,848 --> 00:27:57,334
而有一些彗星
and there are some comets
that eventually kind of look

536
00:27:57,362 --> 00:27:58,639
极象小行星
like asteroids.

537
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,847
一些科学家认为主带彗星
narrator: Some scientists think main-belt comets

538
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:07,597
可能把水和孕育生命的物质
may have delivered water to early Earth

539
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,736
带到了早期的地球
and the materials to create life.

540
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,583
我们回到2004年的1月份
We blast back to January 2004

541
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:19,611
跟随NASA的“星尘号”飞船去执行
and follow NASA's Stardust spacecraft

542
00:28:19,972 --> 00:28:21,861
一项史无前例的任务
on an unprecedented mission

543
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:25,583
到太空里收集未受污染的彗星尘埃
to collect pure comet dust in space.

544
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:29,472
就在火星的附近
Just beyond the planet Mars,

545
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:32,889
我们遇到了“野生2”彗星
we meet up with a comet named Wild 2.

546
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,889
在靠近它的彗发时
Upon approaching its enormous coma,

547
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:39,486
星尘号伸出一个网球拍状
Stardust flips open a paddle-shaped collector tray

548
00:28:39,986 --> 00:28:44,472
由牢固的泡沫气凝胶制成的收集器
filled with a durable foam-like substance called aerogel.

549
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:50,013
比尘粒还小的彗星微粒
Cometary particles no bigger than specks of dust

550
00:28:50,444 --> 00:28:54,972
以6倍于出膛子弹的速度飞进气凝胶里
fly into the aerogel at six times the speed of a rifle bullet.

551
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:59,874
此任务的特别之处，是要保护好微粒的完整
The mission's task is to preserve the precious particles

552
00:28:59,985 --> 00:29:02,124
不能破坏或改变它们
without damaging or altering them.

553
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:07,708
如果想在地球上把这演示出来，可不是容易的事
But this is no easy feat, as we show here on Earth.

554
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,819
在我身边的是康诺特.布鲁尔中士
- We're here at a firing range with Sergeant Connacht Brewer,

555
00:29:12,846 --> 00:29:14,194
他以前是伞兵
a former army paratrooper,

556
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:16,332
他将使用小号铅弹
who is going to demonstrate for us what happens

557
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,180
去射击巨大的粘土模型
when this birdshot strikes
a large block of modeling clay.

558
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:21,444
这非常类似于
This is an excellent analogy for what happened

559
00:29:21,652 --> 00:29:24,138
彗星微粒撞击到
when cometary particles impacted the aerogel

560
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:25,610
星尘号上的气凝胶
on the Stardust spacecraft.

561
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:27,499
略有不同的是
Except there, the particles were moving

562
00:29:27,527 --> 00:29:29,957
微粒移动的速度比这种小号铅弹快50倍
about 50 times faster than this birdshot.

563
00:29:30,054 --> 00:29:30,985
准备好了吗？
Ready to give it a go?

564
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:31,943
准备好了
- Yes, I am.

565
00:29:31,957 --> 00:29:34,318
请戴好护目镜，戴上耳塞
Go ahead and put on your eye protection and your earplugs.

566
00:29:34,401 --> 00:29:35,471
我们将使用
What we're using for this today

567
00:29:35,485 --> 00:29:38,346
雷明登12号1100型猎枪
is a 12-gauge Model 1100 Remington shotgun

568
00:29:38,374 --> 00:29:40,415
射击大约35码外的目标
at a distance of about 35 yards.

569
00:29:41,221 --> 00:29:43,888
即是说，我装填12号子弹
Basically, I'm just gonna load a 12-gauge shot shell

570
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:45,864
到猎枪里...
into the shotgun...

571
00:29:46,304 --> 00:29:47,471
然后开枪
And we're hot.

572
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,165
粘土模型千疮百孔
It really did some damage to that clay.

573
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,151
想看看吗？
You want to go take a look?

574
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:57,262
求之不得
- Yeah, we're clear.

575
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,290
好
- All right.

576
00:30:01,096 --> 00:30:03,443
哇，千疮百孔
Wow, look at the damage it did to the clay.

577
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,845
每一颗子弹都形成了一个洞
- Each pellet created one of these holes.

578
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:08,290
我们把它切成几块，好吗？
So what do you say we cut this open and try to find some pieces?

579
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,720
－这主意不错　－好的
- Sounds good. - All right.

580
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:17,123
看，粘土里的弹迹
So you see, the trail here
that's formed inside the clay

581
00:30:17,151 --> 00:30:20,929
能让你找到小号铅弹
is going to lead you, ultimately,
to where the birdshot pellets are located.

582
00:30:21,276 --> 00:30:23,359
通过眼前的实验，你能想象到
You can imagine how difficult it would have been

583
00:30:23,387 --> 00:30:24,637
星尘号的科研团队
and how time-consuming

584
00:30:24,748 --> 00:30:27,401
解决彗星材料微粒的捕捉问题
for the Stardust team to locate these microscopic pieces

585
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:29,956
是如何困难，如何旷日持久
of cometary material inside the aerogel.

586
00:30:33,526 --> 00:30:35,901
当星尘号回到地球
narrator: Upon Stardust's return to Earth,

587
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:39,914
科学家从气凝胶里找到了1万多块
scientists recovered over 10,000 cometary fragments

588
00:30:39,928 --> 00:30:41,234
彗星碎片
from the aerogel.

589
00:30:42,595 --> 00:30:45,414
通过化学分析，发现在微粒里
Chemical analysis revealed that the particles

590
00:30:45,442 --> 00:30:48,289
含有机化合物甘氨酸
contained the organic compound glycine,

591
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,428
这是生命的基础主材之一
a fundamental building block of life

592
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:55,567
在40多亿年间，一直被保存在冰块里
that had been preserved in ice for over 4 billion years.

593
00:30:56,928 --> 00:30:59,914
彗星里有机化合物的发现
- The discovery of organic compounds in comets

594
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,414
说明了有机化合物很容易形成
suggests that organic compounds can form pretty easily.

595
00:31:03,747 --> 00:31:06,733
它不能说明在彗星上有过活着的生命
Now, it doesn't mean that there was ever anything truly alive

596
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:10,247
但至少说明了生命的基础材料
in those comets, but at least the building blocks of life

597
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,289
曾在彗星上形成过
could have been built in comets.

598
00:31:14,983 --> 00:31:17,525
彗星似乎能保留非常宝贵的
narrator: Comets appear to hold invaluable information

599
00:31:17,553 --> 00:31:19,914
关于太阳系起源的信息
about the origin of our solar system

600
00:31:20,636 --> 00:31:22,997
可能还有它本身起源的信息
and perhaps life itself.

601
00:31:23,872 --> 00:31:25,441
但天文学家发现
But astronomers have discovered

602
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:28,386
这些冰团并非亘古不变
that these icy bodies are not immortal.

603
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:33,705
现在最先进的卫星拍摄到
Now state-of-the-art satellites have captured images

604
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:37,330
一群彗星将会踏上
of a select group of comets that will end their life

605
00:31:37,386 --> 00:31:39,830
自杀之旅
in a suicidal death dive.

606
00:31:47,483 --> 00:31:49,483
我们觉得与彗星的同行
While our journey with the comets

607
00:31:49,621 --> 00:31:52,788
就象一个无穷尽的过山车游戏
has felt like an endless cosmic roller coaster ride,

608
00:31:53,969 --> 00:31:57,524
但这些冰团却不会永远绕着太阳飞行
these icy objects will not orbit our Sun forever.

609
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:02,538
绝大多数还会飞行数千年
Most will make the voyage for several thousand years

610
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:06,219
直到它们被蒸发掉，只剩下尘埃颗粒
before evaporating into specks of dust.

611
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:12,302
甚至巨型彗星，比如哈雷彗星
Even massive comets, like Haley,

612
00:32:12,468 --> 00:32:15,413
也只有150,000年的生命
only have 150,000 years left.

613
00:32:16,246 --> 00:32:21,315
这是因为，彗星每一秒都会失去数吨的冰
That's because, every second, a comet loses tons of ice.

614
00:32:22,552 --> 00:32:25,496
彗星会渐渐萎缩或湮灭
- Comets gradually wither away or fade away,

615
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:27,968
因为在临近太阳的每一刻
because every time they pass close to the Sun,

616
00:32:28,065 --> 00:32:29,871
它们都会失去一些冰块
they lose some of their ices.

617
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:31,371
它们被蒸发了
They evaporate away.

618
00:32:31,635 --> 00:32:34,315
最后，只有很少的冰块留下
Eventually, there's very little ice left,

619
00:32:34,343 --> 00:32:37,551
以至于形成不了彗发和彗尾
and so the comet coma and tail doesn't form.

620
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:39,607
这时的它象小行星
It just looks like an asteroid.

621
00:32:39,787 --> 00:32:43,037
或者甚至会破碎为许多小物体
Or it may even break apart into a whole bunch of little objects

622
00:32:43,121 --> 00:32:45,885
因为冰的胶合力已不复存在了
because the icy glue is no longer there

623
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,954
或者是潮汐的影响使它发生破裂
or because tidal effects actually break it apart.

624
00:32:51,093 --> 00:32:54,398
但不是所有彗星都会平静地消失在阳光里
narrator: But not all comets quietly fade into the sunset.

625
00:32:58,051 --> 00:33:01,384
我们现在正穷追着一群彗星
We're now in hot pursuit of a group of comets

626
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,301
它们被称为“掠日彗星”
called sungrazers

627
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:05,801
其生命匆匆，分外短暂
that live fast and die young.

628
00:33:08,204 --> 00:33:11,495
当彗星沿着非常狭长的轨道
Inside our spacecraft, we feel the heat

629
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,579
带我们去到离太阳很近
as the comets' extremely elongated orbits

630
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,203
相隔只有数十万英里的地方...
bring us very close to the Sun...

631
00:33:17,606 --> 00:33:20,120
飞船里的我们感受到了太阳的炽热
within a few hundred thousand miles.

632
00:33:22,342 --> 00:33:24,565
在这个危险区域里，我们不时看到
As we enter this danger zone,

633
00:33:24,981 --> 00:33:27,787
有一些彗星象日本神风队一样
we see that some of these kamikaze comets

634
00:33:27,815 --> 00:33:30,814
径自冲向太阳
occasionally plunge right into our home star,

635
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,884
上演了一场残忍的告别演出
creating a ferocious spectacle.

636
00:33:37,078 --> 00:33:39,870
掠日彗星的诞生与普通彗星相同
- Sungrazer comets start out their life as normal comets.

637
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:41,648
它们或是居住在奥尔特云
They probably live either in the Oort cloud,

638
00:33:41,675 --> 00:33:43,398
或者本来就是短周期彗星
or they're short-period comets,

639
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:45,925
但它们的不幸在于，遇上了一个行星
but they've had an unlucky encounter with another planet,

640
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:47,286
可能是木星
probably Jupiter.

641
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:50,175
如果它们非常、非常幸运
If they're really, really lucky,

642
00:33:50,203 --> 00:33:52,870
就可以逃脱，从而避免
they might just escape and be able to get away

643
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,897
经过太阳时过于靠近它
with one close passage by the Sun,

644
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:57,800
如果运气不好，太阳会让它们彻底地灰飞烟灭
but if they're not lucky, they just get swallowed up whole by the Sun.

645
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:05,258
太阳和太阳风层探测器，简称SOHO
narrator: The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory,or SOHO,

646
00:34:05,717 --> 00:34:07,300
是一颗太空卫星
or SOHO, is a space satellite

647
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:11,328
已经发现了2,000颗正在自杀途中的彗星
that has observed 2,000 comets on suicidal orbits.

648
00:34:14,397 --> 00:34:17,730
最著名的掠日彗星是克鲁兹族彗星
The most famous sungrazers are the Kreutz family,

649
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,925
它们是由一颗巨型彗星
which originated from one giant comet

650
00:34:21,078 --> 00:34:23,716
破裂而成的许多碎片
that broke up into many smaller pieces.

651
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:28,050
目睹来自外太阳系的彗星
- It's a kind of cool thing to think of a comet

652
00:34:28,063 --> 00:34:29,591
一直坠落
that's lived in the outer solar system

653
00:34:29,605 --> 00:34:32,442
在太阳里粉身碎骨
just falling all the way and smashing into the Sun,

654
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,536
感觉真爽，屡看不厌
but they do. We see them all the time.

655
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:42,744
有些彗星不只是想自杀
narrator: And some comets do more than self-destruct.

656
00:34:43,605 --> 00:34:46,799
它们还梦想成为超级杀手
They become the messengers of mass destruction.

657
00:34:48,813 --> 00:34:51,105
巨型彗星撞击地球
It's estimated that a large comet

658
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:55,007
据估计，大约每4千万年可能发生一次
may have struck Earth roughly every 40 million years,

659
00:34:55,257 --> 00:34:58,424
以至于如今的地球还残留许多明显弹坑
based on the amount of craters still visible on our planet.

660
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:04,785
彗星也许要对地球史上
A comet may have even been responsible

661
00:35:04,882 --> 00:35:08,424
最著名的灭绝事件负责
for the most famous extinction event of all time.

662
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:14,702
在白垩-第三纪时期发生的
- For the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event,

663
00:35:14,757 --> 00:35:16,216
6千5百万年前恐龙灭绝
the one that took out the dinosaurs

664
00:35:16,243 --> 00:35:19,257
其原因至今没有定论
65 million years ago, the jury is still out.

665
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,063
人们认为是一个直径10公里的物体
That was thought to be a 10-kilometer-sized object,

666
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:25,313
但在地球附近，没有小行星
and there are no asteroids in near-Earth space

667
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,813
可以把地球撞击得如此惨烈
that are that large that could impact the Earth,

668
00:35:29,118 --> 00:35:32,118
却有为数不少的巨型彗星
and there are a number of comets that are that large.

669
00:35:32,438 --> 00:35:35,007
况且那是发生6千5百万年前
And since it occurred 65 million years ago,

670
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:37,035
而彗星撞击
and you would expect a cometary impact

671
00:35:37,062 --> 00:35:39,965
大约是每4千万年一次
every 40 million years or so,

672
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:42,187
所以它可能就是彗星
it may well have been a comet.

673
00:35:43,826 --> 00:35:46,146
由于彗星在过去
narrator: While comets likely slammed into Earth

674
00:35:46,173 --> 00:35:48,409
有可能无数次撞击过地球
countless times in the past,

675
00:35:49,034 --> 00:35:50,520
所以很难以判定
it's been difficult to determine

676
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:54,951
一个撞击坑是由彗星还是小行星产生的
if an impact crater was made by a comet or asteroid

677
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:57,868
毕竟这两种物体很类似
because the two bodies appear to be similar.

678
00:36:00,382 --> 00:36:02,326
我们通过研究化石
- When we study the fossil records,

679
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,923
发现了大量的罕见材料
a lot of the material is gone,
and just-we simply can't find it,

680
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,465
但彗星与小行星有许多共同的原材料
and it turns out that asteroids and comets
have a lot of materials in common,

681
00:36:09,576 --> 00:36:12,312
所以，即使你发现了外星物质
so even if you do find extraterrestrial material,

682
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,451
也难于分清楚
it's really hard to tell

683
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:15,923
它到底来自于小行星，还是彗星
whether it came from an asteroid or from a comet.

684
00:36:17,673 --> 00:36:19,353
彗星撞击地球
narrator: And to complicate matters,

685
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:22,714
引发灾难的话题
a comet doesn't even have to impact Earth's surface

686
00:36:22,742 --> 00:36:24,603
一直众说纷纭
to ignite a catastrophe.

687
00:36:27,506 --> 00:36:31,714
在1908年，一个火球在西伯利亚
In 1908, a fireball exploded in the atmosphere

688
00:36:31,742 --> 00:36:34,798
通古斯地区的荒野上空爆炸
above the Tunguska wilderness in Siberia.

689
00:36:35,478 --> 00:36:37,548
空中爆炸所产生的温度和能量
The heat and energy from the airburst

690
00:36:37,575 --> 00:36:40,770
象热旋风一样往下推进
propelled downward like a hot tornado.

691
00:36:41,464 --> 00:36:43,978
它横扫丛林
It propagated across the forest,

692
00:36:44,075 --> 00:36:47,811
把方圆800英里森林夷为平地
flattening over 800 square miles of trees.

693
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:52,603
在一个世纪之后，一些科学家猜想
For over a century, some scientists have wondered

694
00:36:52,631 --> 00:36:57,547
这位不速之客是不是彗星或者小行星
if the cosmic intruder was a comet or an asteroid.

695
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:00,394
如果是彗星
- If it were caused by a comet,

696
00:37:00,436 --> 00:37:02,492
你就会在沉积物中
you would imagine you'd find in the sediment

697
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,783
找到一些不寻常的迹象
some record of unusual things,

698
00:37:04,811 --> 00:37:07,978
比如氦-3和氦-4的比例
like a ratio of helium 3 to helium 4.

699
00:37:08,075 --> 00:37:10,700
这才能够说明它可能是彗星
That could be an indication that it may have been a comet.

700
00:37:10,783 --> 00:37:12,852
或者是
Now, another possibility is if you find

701
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,866
在湖里找到奇异的同位素
some strange isotope buried in a lake somewhere.

702
00:37:16,214 --> 00:37:18,269
但这无异于大海捞针
That's tough. This is not easy.

703
00:37:21,144 --> 00:37:22,325
虽然难以证明
narrator: While it's been difficult

704
00:37:22,352 --> 00:37:25,477
彗星是否曾撞击地球
to substantiate cometary impacts on Earth,

705
00:37:28,297 --> 00:37:30,352
但有物理证据表明
physical proof of their colossal power

706
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,991
它们在巨型气态行星上威力强大
exists on the gas giant planets.

707
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:38,060
对地球来说，这些事件是严重的警告
And these dramatic events warn that far worse collisions

708
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,463
在未来的日子里
loom in the future,

709
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:43,588
极为糟糕的撞击在步步逼近
with Earth as the potential bull's-eye.

我们已经尾随着彗星
As we have followed the trail of comets through space,

712
00:37:55,157 --> 00:37:57,088
穿越了太阳系里
we have passed through the chilliest

713
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:00,060
极寒冷和极暖和的地方
and warmest places in our solar system.

714
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:03,838
我们还调查了这些冰团
We've also investigated whether these icy bodies

715
00:38:03,852 --> 00:38:07,852
是否曾经传递和毁灭生命
have been deliverers and destroyers of life.

而且有新证据表明，许多这样的古老物体
And new observations prove many of these ancient bodies

718
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:19,282
安享晚年
of our solar system.

719
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:24,949
那里有一些晚期的彗星
- We think there are several possible end states for comets.

720
00:38:25,101 --> 00:38:28,490
它们一是可能被扯向太阳
In one case, they can actually get pulled right into the Sun.

721
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:30,462
二是可能被某一个行星
In other cases, they can actually get scattered

722
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,448
强行赶出去
by one of the planets and kind of get kicked out,

723
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,198
或许回到奥尔特云，永远都见不到
maybe back into the Oort cloud and never seen again.

724
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:38,421
最后一种可能是，它们撞上某个行星
And finally they can also actually impact a planet.

725
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,865
我们现在飞回到1994年的7月
narrator: We now shuttle back to July 1994.

726
00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:51,268
我们去追随
We follow a string of

727
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:55,226
有着21块碎块的苏梅克-列维彗星
21 comet fragments called Shoemaker-Levy 9

728
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:58,892
观察它们因重力的影响而坠入
as they're gravitationally pulled toward the gas giant

729
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:00,851
巨型气态行星－木星
planet Jupiter.

730
00:39:01,892 --> 00:39:02,934
如果我们
- If we were riding on

731
00:39:02,962 --> 00:39:05,948
和苏梅克-列维彗星碎块一起飞行
one of the fragments of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9,

732
00:39:06,142 --> 00:39:07,809
就会看到非常壮观的景象
it would have been truly spectacular

733
00:39:07,837 --> 00:39:09,962
因为随着我们的逼近
because we're heading toward Jupiter,

734
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,948
木星这颗巨星变得巨大无比
and this giant planet is looming ever bigger,

735
00:39:13,114 --> 00:39:14,309
接着啪哒作响
and then-splat!

736
00:39:14,337 --> 00:39:15,600
我们撞上它了
We crash into it.

737
00:39:15,628 --> 00:39:20,767
一团烟幕腾空而起
We throw up a whole bunch of material from the insides.

738
00:39:20,864 --> 00:39:23,031
令人叹为观止
It would be really an amazing journey.

739
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:25,739

narrator: Shoemaker-Levy 9 left impact scars

743
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,489
如同地球般大小
the size of Earth,

744
00:39:39,225 --> 00:39:41,211
如果它撞击地球
driving home the scale of violence

745
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:45,364
后果将不堪设想
that comets can produce if they slam into our planet.

746
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,864
如果这些碎块的任何一块撞击地球
- If any of those fragments had hit the Earth

747
00:39:49,892 --> 00:39:52,933
与木星不同，我们会陷入极度危险
rather than Jupiter, we'd have been in serious trouble,

748
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:56,586
因为它们都是大块头，而且来势迅猛
because they were large and they were coming in extremely rapidly.

749
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,503
但幸运的是，老大哥木星
But fortunately, big brother Jupiter

750
00:39:58,516 --> 00:40:00,850
代我们接受撞击
took all the hits for us and didn't seem to

751
00:40:00,878 --> 00:40:02,530
而且若无其事
suffer much in the way of damage.

752
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:07,155
但是，尽管有木星这块行星盾牌
narrator: But even with Jupiter acting as a planetary shield,

753
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,252
还是会有漏网之鱼
comets still sneak by the gas giants

754
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:13,780
突如其来地接近地球
and have close encounters with Earth.

755
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,586
好消息是
- The good news is,

756
00:40:15,641 --> 00:40:18,502
在近地空间里，袭击地球的
asteroid impacts are far more likely to occur

757
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:21,947
更多时候是小行星，因为它们的数量
because asteroids outnumber comets 100 to 1

758
00:40:21,974 --> 00:40:23,419
比彗星多100倍
in near-Earth space.

759
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:25,558
坏消息是，如果彗星沿着
The bad news is, if we do find a comet

760
00:40:25,585 --> 00:40:27,697
撞击地球的轨道飞行
on an Earth-impacting trajectory,

761
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:29,294
我们不会有所察觉
we wouldn't realize it

762
00:40:29,322 --> 00:40:31,766
除非它在进入木星轨道时
till it got inside the orbit of Jupiter,

763
00:40:31,794 --> 00:40:34,197
会开始喷发气体和尘埃
when it started throwing off gas and dust.

764
00:40:35,544 --> 00:40:37,710
虽然彗星接近地球不太可能
- In the very unlikely event that a comet

765
00:40:37,724 --> 00:40:39,613
但你要考虑它
could get close to the Earth, you would worry about it

766
00:40:39,641 --> 00:40:43,419
因为其平均速度要高于小行星
because they tend to have high average velocities
relative to an asteroid,

767
00:40:43,502 --> 00:40:45,363
达到每秒几十英里
as high as tens of miles a second.

768
00:40:45,655 --> 00:40:48,043
也就是说，它们出拳凶猛有力
So in other words, they would pack a bigger punch.

769
00:40:49,224 --> 00:40:51,807
邻近地球的小行星数量众多
narrator: While the frequency of near-Earth asteroids

770
00:40:51,835 --> 00:40:53,766
袭击地球的可能性很高
heightens the risk of impacts,

771
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:56,766
但彗星的速度同样令人不安
the speed of comets is equally troubling.

00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:06,001
（询问宇宙）

775
00:41:06,557 --> 00:41:11,821
对人类更有危险的，是小行星还是彗星？
What poses a greater hazard to humans: asteroids or comets?

776
00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:14,113
罗宾，这问题非同小同
- Robin, that's an important question.

777
00:41:14,363 --> 00:41:16,182
小行星数不胜数
The asteroids are more numerous,

778
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,223
很多都有可能撞击我们
so there's more of them that could hit us.

779
00:41:18,348 --> 00:41:20,543
但我们能跟踪它们的轨迹
But we can track their trajectories

780
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:23,529
对即将到来的撞击采取措施
and maybe do something about one that's gonna hit us,

781
00:41:23,571 --> 00:41:25,098
比如让它转向
deflect it for example.

782
00:41:25,515 --> 00:41:27,293
彗星相对较为罕见
The comets are more rare,

783
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,515
但我们难以觉察它们的到来
but we have very little warning when they come in.

784
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:33,418
而且，它们的速度比小行星快得多
And also, they move much faster than asteroids,

785
00:41:33,445 --> 00:41:36,459
撞击地球的能量更大
so there's more energy impacting Earth.

786
00:41:36,598 --> 00:41:39,584
所以我认为，彗星最危险
So I would say comets are the most hazardous objects.

787
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,765
（询问宇宙）

788
00:41:43,612 --> 00:41:46,737
NASA很认真地对待彗星的威胁

789
00:41:47,473 --> 00:41:49,417
迄今为止，负责跟踪的卫星
So far, tracking satellites

have tagged 84 near-Earth comets,

791
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:56,487
其轨道是在地球绕太阳公转路线的
objects with orbits that come within 28 million miles

792
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:58,681
2千8百万英里范围内
of Earth's path around the Sun.

793
00:41:59,834 --> 00:42:01,306
眼下还没有
- There are no periodic comets

794
00:42:01,334 --> 00:42:03,723
喜欢上地球的周期彗星
that currently have Earth's name written on them.

795
00:42:04,153 --> 00:42:06,195
但木星和其它的巨型行星
But Jupiter and the other giant planets

796
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,764
偶尔会扰乱彗星的轨道
occasionally perturb the orbits of comets.

797
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:11,851
所以未来应该会有一颗周期彗星
So there could be a periodic comet in the future

798
00:42:11,973 --> 00:42:13,750
与地球相撞
that will collide with Earth.

自有史记载以来
narrator: Since the beginning of recorded history,

801
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:28,639
被发现的彗星超过 4,200颗
over 4,200 comets have been observed,

802
00:42:29,472 --> 00:42:33,445
但这只是这些冰团的一小部分
a mere fraction of the total number of these icy bodies.

803
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,278
这意味着数百万的未知彗星
This means billions of unknown comets

804
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:41,055
还在外层空间潜伏着、等待着
still lie in wait in the outer reaches of space.

805
00:42:41,944 --> 00:42:46,014
某一天，一颗末日彗星会被推出来
One day, a doomsday comet could be nudged out

806
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:48,972
踏上与地球相撞的旅程
and sent on a collision course with Earth.

807
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:54,041
假设我们是在宇宙里的高速公路上
- If we're on that cosmic highway,

808
00:42:54,152 --> 00:42:56,361
而它开进了我们的车道
and it's getting into our on-ramp,

809
00:42:57,194 --> 00:42:58,389
我们需要提防它
we need to worry about it.

810
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:01,208
但我们只有非常短的反应时间
And we need to worry about it
with very little lead time.

811
00:43:02,027 --> 00:43:03,666
我们别无选择
- There is very little we can do,

812
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,833
只能向它们发射巨型原子弹
other than sending a giant bomb toward them

813
00:43:05,861 --> 00:43:07,222
设法让它们转向
and trying to deflect them.

814
00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:08,708
但非常棘手的是
But that's very difficult

815
00:43:08,736 --> 00:43:10,499
我们只有几个月的预警时间
when there's only a few months' warning.

816
00:43:12,374 --> 00:43:15,486
正如彗星让我们的祖先
narrator: Just as comets have inspired awe and fear

817
00:43:15,513 --> 00:43:17,527
感到无比的敬畏和害怕
among our ancestors,

818
00:43:18,236 --> 00:43:21,041
它们今天依然不可藐视
they remain a force to reckon with.

819
00:43:21,749 --> 00:43:24,916
通过持续追踪它们的尘埃尾巴
By continuing to track their tails of dust,

820
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:29,402
我们也许能发现关于我们遥远过去的
we may uncover more clues about these frozen artifacts

821
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,680
更多线索
of our ancient past.

822
00:43:32,596 --> 00:43:34,443
你会觉得它很不寻常
- It's pretty remarkable if you think about it.

823
00:43:34,471 --> 00:43:37,443
在数百年前，我们不知道它们是什么
Just a few hundred years ago, we had no idea what they were.

824
00:43:37,471 --> 00:43:38,943
不知道它们的意义
We had no idea what they meant.

825
00:43:38,985 --> 00:43:41,430
但现在我们已经去到了彗星表面
And now we've actually been to the surfaces of comets.

826
00:43:41,457 --> 00:43:44,194
近距离地观察它们，去研究
We've seen up close and personal what they're really like

827
00:43:44,263 --> 00:43:45,402
它们的组成
and what they're made out of.

828
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:48,124
总之，这些神秘之物对人类
So these mysterious objects have meant a lot to humans

829
00:43:48,152 --> 00:43:49,207
意义非同凡响
throughout our history.

830
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:50,929
它们曾被视为异兆
They've been agents of change.

831
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,263
它们有时被当作灾星
They've been agents of destruction sometimes.

832
00:43:54,652 --> 00:43:56,665
它们也许曾是造物使者
They've maybe been agents of creation.
