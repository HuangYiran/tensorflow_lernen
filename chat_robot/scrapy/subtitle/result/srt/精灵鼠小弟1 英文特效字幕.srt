00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,530
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could we possibly...?

33
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,920
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Choose? I know.

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,490
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wonderful is...

37
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,590
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...how you both know what the other one is gonna say...

00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,630
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...before you even say it.

39
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,960
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not that it's any of my business.

40
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,100
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, that happens when you've been together as long as we have.

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,670
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From being a family.

42
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,710
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Family. Wow.

43

{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we can find just what you're looking for.

46
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,450

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,630
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or maybe you wanted a boy.

49
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,260
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, I think we were leaning towards a boy.

50
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,990
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, in that case...

54
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,170
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You certainly know a lot about everyone.

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,670
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what happens when you've been here as long as I have.

56
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,600
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's face it.

57
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,680
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not everyone wants to adopt someone like me.

58
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,080
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You shouldn't worry about choosing.

59
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,080
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It happens the same way every time.

60
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,280
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First, you won't know what to do. You'll be a bit scared.

61
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,220
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you'll meet one of them.

62
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,020
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll talk to him.

63
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,460
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somehow...

64

{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you just know.

65
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,000
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you quite certain you're prepared to handle his uniqueness?

66
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,370
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my, yes.

67
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His uniqueness is a perfect fit for the Little family.

68

{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. and Mrs. Little,

00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we try to discourage couples...

70
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,960
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...from adopting children outside their own...

71
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,460
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...species.

72
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,930
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It rarely works out.

73
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,260
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it will in this case.

74
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,070


75
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,460

00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,440
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even if they've never been here.

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,420
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have any money.

95
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,060
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's Uncle Crenshaw, Cousin Edgar, Grandpa Spencer.

96
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,820
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's Aunt Beatrice...

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,440
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You spit Stuart out this instant.

{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart is family now.

108
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,160
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We do not eat family members.

109
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,330
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, Dad, I'm home!

110
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,630
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is he here? Is my brother here?

111
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,960
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He certainly is. -Where is he?

112
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,840
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's here. Stuart, this is George.

113
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,850
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}George, this is Stuart, your new brother.

114
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,750
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Really?

115
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really, George. This is your new brother.

116
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,080
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look somewhat like a mouse.

117
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,090
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, well, I am somewhat like a mouse.

118
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,790
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see.

119
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,590
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to go.

120
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,340
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it just me, or did he seem a little disappointed?

121
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,380
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, he's always a little tired after school.

122
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,640
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perks up around dinnertime.

123
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,460
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Meat loaf is delicious, dear.

124
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,990
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cajun.

125
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,960
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shall we get to know each other a little?

126
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,140
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}George? Don't you have anything you wanna ask Stuart?

127
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,240
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure, George. Go ahead. I'm an open book.

128
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,540
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ask me anything, the first thing that pops into your head.

129
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,540
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you pass the gravy?

130
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,240
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Your new bedroom. -We hope you like it.

131
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure is roomy.

132
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,390
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, Mom.

133
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,400
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, Dad.

134
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,660
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, son.

135
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,670
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good night, sweetie.

136
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,760
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice kitty.

137
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,600
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice kitty. Pretty kitty.

138
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,700
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you cozy?

139
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,280
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, thanks. I'm quite comfortable.

140
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,380
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All I've got to sleep on is a rag, you little rat!

141
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,250
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You seem tense.

142
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,610
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tense? I'm way past tense.

143
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,720
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, maybe I can help.

144
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,120
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you like? Can I scratch your ears?

145
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,160
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could rub your tummy.

146
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,490
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd you like to rub it from the inside?

147
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,030
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, I'm confused.

148
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,560
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought that's what you do with a pet.

149
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A pet? I am not your pet!

150
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,830
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a cat. You're a mouse. You should live in a hole.

151
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,730
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is my family.

152
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,580
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't we share them?

153
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,010
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Read my furry pink lips: No.

154
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,010
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe this. I'm arguing with lunch.

155
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,780
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay away from the windows.

156
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,680
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The other cats find out about this, I'm ruined.

157
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,190
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gotta relax. Where's my tinkle ball?

158
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,560
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}George?

159
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,390
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Time to get up. -Okay, Mom.

160
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart, you too.

161
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,660
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Mom.

162
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,760
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}George, I'm trying to get the laundry started.

163
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,320
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the laundry chute, please!

164
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,000
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

165
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:02,780
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dear.

166
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,280
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom! Hello! Mom!

167
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,880
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Stuart! I'm in the washing machine. Mom!

168
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,850
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, Mom!

169
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,600
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you going?

170
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,540
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That's odd. -What is?

171
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,510
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought someone was at the door.

172
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,440
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look beautiful, dear.

173
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,710
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, should we talk to George before you go?

174
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-About what? -About Stuart.

175
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,150
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He hasn't exactly embraced the situation.

176
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,630
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snowbell! Thank goodness you're here. I'm locked in the washer!

177
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,730
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you help me? Can you turn this thing off?

178
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,160
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would I turn it off?

179
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,810
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my favorite show.

180
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,240
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's funny. That's funny, Snowbell.

181
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,780
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You can't leave me! -Talk to the butt.

182
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,310
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you going?

183
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,110
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've gotta stare at traffic, yawn, lick myself.

184
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,250
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And believe me, that could take hours if you do it right.

185
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,790
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ciao!

186
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,320
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure that Stuart is happy here?

187
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,390
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's having the time of his life.

188
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,760
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help! Somebody, please help me!

189
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,380
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Stuart.

190
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart, where are you?

191
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,790
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart, are you all right?

192
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,730
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm okay, Mom. I'm...

193
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,920
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is he gonna be all right?

194
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,820
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, a lad that size swallowing all that detergent...

195
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,020
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Amazingly, I think he's gonna be fine.

196
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Also, he's very clean.

197
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,900
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Glad you're feeling better. -Me too.

198
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,540
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll pick out a whole new wardrobe.

199
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,610
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you go.

200
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,570
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, George. This'll be fun.

201
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,690
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna go shopping with Stuart.

202
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,410
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You should... Talk to him. -You're right.

203
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,820
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, George, I wanted to talk to you about Stuart.

204
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,590
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want you to know that if you and he were to spend...

205
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,170
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...some real time together, brother time...

206
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,700
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that one.

207
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,010
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, George. You have a boat, a beautiful one.

208
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,570
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not finished.

209
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,080
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You better get moving. The race is soon.

210
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,710
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So?

211
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,710
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you wanna race your boat?

212
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,890
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm not so good at the racing part. -So what?

213
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,890
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't matter about winning. You try like heck, and you have fun.

214
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,450
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's fun to finish last?

215
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,460
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something formal, I should think.

216
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,490
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something formal, I should think.

217
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,390
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not sure of the fabric, but it should breathe.

218
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,730
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has a tendency to burrow and climb...

219
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,000
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and generally scurry about.

220
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,510
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm sure we can find something to suit your particular need.

221
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,310
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we have Barbados Ben.

222
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,240
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Chef Ben.

223
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,850
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lumberjack Ben.

224
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,650
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, of course, Gladiator Ben.

225
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,830
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does Ben always dress like this?

226
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, madam.

227
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,360
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are many moods of Ben...

228
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,660
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and it all depends on the occasion.

229
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,340
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what if the occasion were a simple family party?

230
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,010
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I have just the thing.

231
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,350
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There they are.

232
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,650
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}George?

233
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,450
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shopping.

234
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,530
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Everything all right in there? -Don't come in.

235
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,400
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shy.

236
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,400
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do I look?

237
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,570
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Fantastic. I hardly recognize you. -Very smart.

238
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,300
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look just like a Little.

239
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,570
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do?

240
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,370
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

241
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,300
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was worried I was gonna look just like Ben.

242
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, auntie.

243

244

{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frederick!

245
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,790
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little high, Little low.

246
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,160
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little hey, Little ho!

247
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,930
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We come bearing gifts for young Stuart.

248
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,760
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, where is my new nephew?

249
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,570
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Little family's getting bigger and bigger.

250
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,040
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boy.

251
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,240
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a lot of Littles.

252
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,570
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uncle Crenshaw!

253
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,760
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's my favorite little nephew.

254
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,190
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't say that anymore, Crenshaw.

255
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,060
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right. Now we have two favorite little nephews.

256
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,490
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is the lad?

257
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,600
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has a lot of gifts to open.

258
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,700
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are any of those for me?

259
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,280
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Attention, everybody. We'd like to introduce you to someone.

260
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,840
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Stuart.

261
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,380
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello, everyone.

262
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,530
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He's a, a... -...dorable!

263
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,670
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Adorable. -Yeah, that's right.

264
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,460
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't think of the word.

265
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,600
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Stuart, look.

266
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,040
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that.

267
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,740
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a real Schmelling.

268
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,580
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Those are the best kind. -You know what they say:

269
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,880
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-"If it ain't Schmelling..." -"It ain't bowling."

270
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,710
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look here, Stuart.

271
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,920
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Climb on up here, son. Plant your caboose right up here.

272
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,500
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He may have to grow into it.

273
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,470
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think he's grown a little since we've been here.

274
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,870
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what happened to me. One summer, I just shot right up.

275
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,880
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May I say something?

276
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,150
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the orphanage, we used to tell fairy tales...

277
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,450
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...of finding our families and having a party like this.

278
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A party with cakes and presents

279
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,590
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and all varieties of meat loaf.

280
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,020
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A party with a big family who came from far away just to wish us well.

281
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,760
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know much about families...

282
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,800
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but this must be the nicest family in the world.

283
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,000
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I just wanted to thank each of you.

284
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,040
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because now I know...

285
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,370
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...fairy tales are real.

286
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,810
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fairy tales are real?

287
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,880
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I'm gonna cough up a furball.

288
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,280
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now it's time for the best present of all.

289
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's something for you and George.

290
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,560
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stand next to Stuart.

291
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,320
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is something that gave your father and me...

292
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,260
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...hours of enjoyment when we were young brothers...

293
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,990
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...just like you and Stuart.

294
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,340
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This ball...

295
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,470
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...belonged to your great-great-grandfather...

296
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Jedediah Little.

297
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,460
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, Frederick,

298
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,380
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}those long summer days playing catch?

299
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take your brother outside and toss around the old horsehide.

300
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,430
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, what do you say, George? You ready?

301
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,420
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you all nuts?

302
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,660
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bicycles and bowling balls?

303
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,030
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's he gonna toss a baseball?

304
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,330
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's he gonna do any of those things?

305
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,970
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not my brother. He's a mouse.

306
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,040
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Time to go. -Excellent idea.

307
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,090
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, what? Where?

308
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,970
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did I hurt you? What's the matter?

309
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,210
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted to ask you something, but you were already asleep.

310
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,810
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What did you wanna ask? -About my real family.

311
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,080
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, the ones I look like.

312
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,080
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He hates us.

313
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,190
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've never been hated before.

314
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,220
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's not that. It's not that at all.

315
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just that...

316
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,190
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...something's missing.

317
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,990
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel an empty space inside me...

318
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,560
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and I want to know what was there before.

319
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,160
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have an empty space.

320
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,670
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's so sad.

321
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,370
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dear. I hope I haven't left you dismayed and disappointed.

322
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,270
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No, don't, no. -No.

323
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,350
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't feel dismayed and disappointed.

324
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,140
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not at all.

325
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,510
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure?

326
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,090
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're certain, Stuart.

327
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,260
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if you want us to, we'll find out about your real parents.

328
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,550
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, good night, then.

329
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,740
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out of the question. It's against the rules.

330
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,470
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides, it's very hard to track mouse families.

331
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,050
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're not very good with paperwork.

332
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,710
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he has an empty space.

333
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,040
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are there problems with Stuart?

334
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,660
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Problem...? No, not at all.

335
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,490
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Well, there's been a few... -Difficulties.

336
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,730
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Difficulties?

337
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,960
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, like the cat trying to eat him when we first brought him home.

338
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,290
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He spat the boy out, of course, in one heck of a jiffy.

339
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,310
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Keeper...

340
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,810
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wants to know about his family.

341
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,400
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any child would have questions about that.

342
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,780
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

343
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,830
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Snow?

344
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,100
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that you and I got off on the wrong paw.

345
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,210
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted to see if we could start out fresh.

346
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,930
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know? Clean slate.

347
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,740
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you say? Wanna be friends?

348
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,870
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

349
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,550
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, then.

350
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,960
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's playing with my head. He's trying to psych me out.

351
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,490
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sick little rodent!

352
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,220
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snow, let me in!

353
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,260
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm starving! What's in the dish?

354
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,430
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. Monty the Mouth.

355
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,730
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he sees Stuart, it'll be all over the neighborhood.

356
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,130
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go away! There's no food.

357
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,460
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please.

358
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,240
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not picky, as long as it ain't meat loaf.

359
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,740
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That stuff gives me gas, something awful.

360
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,540
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, it's meat loaf.

361
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,810
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beggars can't be choosers. Load me up and light a match.

362
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,380
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Monty. Stop. You don't wanna do that.

363
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,180
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I eat from garbage cans, drink from public toilets.

364
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,190
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like a little gas will bother me.

365
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, wait. Don't!

366
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,560
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, great. What am I gonna tell him now?

367
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,000
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Monty, I can explain.

368
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,500
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Explain what?

369
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,500
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Explain that you should stuff your face.

370
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, thanks.

371
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,870
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna rush you, but you have to leave.

372
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Littles are due back,

373
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,780
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they don't like strange cats in the house.

374
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,750
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not that you're strange.

375
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snow, what's wrong with you?

376
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,420
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing.

377
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,700
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the one acting strange.

378
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,650
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it? Worms? Fleas?

379
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,520
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you look pale.

380
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,530
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you should see a vet.

381
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,100
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A vet? What a swell idea.

382
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,460
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know one? I'm not happy with mine.

383
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,970
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He makes us wait, and his hands are cold.

384
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,210
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that?

385
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,510
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was what?

386
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,610
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that... What?

387
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,540
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I hate to eat and run.

388
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,840
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, please. By all means, run.

389
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,540
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run like the wind!

390
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,110
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Phew, that was gross.

391
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,780
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snow, I almost forgot to thank you.

392
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,720
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the...?

393
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,060
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

394
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,470
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my pants.

395
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,200
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're putting some wild prizes in there.

396
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,710
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello. You must be a friend of Snowbell's.

397
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,320
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'm Stuart. -Aren't you gonna run?

398
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,750
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

399
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,550
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because you're a mouse.

400
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,660
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not just a mouse.

401
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,020
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm also a member of this family.

402
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A mouse with a pet cat.

403
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,770
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A mouse with a pet cat!

404
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,740
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess that is pretty funny.

405
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,410
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pretty funny?! I'm gonna wet my fur!

406
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,280
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A mouse with a pet cat!

407
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,040
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your new little master.

408
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,550
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait till the boys hear about this.

409
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,450
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The humiliation.

410
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna kill you!

411
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come back here!

412
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,650
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. No more Mr. Nice Kitty.

413
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,990
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You!

414
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,090
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't go in there.

415
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,760
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's George's room! Come back. Come on out.

416
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,160
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't hurt you.

417
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,490
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanna show you something.

418
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,720
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing here?

419
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,690
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just thought I'd drop in.

420
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,590
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you build these?

421
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,560
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me and my dad.

422
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,100
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is incredible. It's like being in a real live Western.

423
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,970
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Howdy, partner.

424
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,200
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Draw, you lily-livered, yellow-bellied son-of-a-one-eyed-prairie-dog.

425
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,610
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm trying to concentrate.

426
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,210
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

427
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,210
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that a train?

428
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,720
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's it look like, picklehead?

429
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:24,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could we play with it? Please, please, please?

430
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,300
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help! Somebody help me!

431
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,040
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help! Please!

432
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,870
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somebody help me!

433
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,510
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Thank you very much. Thank you. -You're crazy.

434
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,580
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have an idea.

435
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,700
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hop in.

436
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,610
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A roadster.

437
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:16,280
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead, check it out.

438
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,350
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart, what's wrong?

439
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,620
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing...

440
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,660
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the first time I've fit in since I got here.

441
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,790
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?

442
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,140
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that.

443
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,770
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the Wasp.

444
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,580
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She is beautiful.

445
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,010
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-But she's not finished. -When are you gonna finish it?

446
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:58,160
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, me and my dad were building her, but I decided to stop.

447
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,480
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How come?

448
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,590
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm too little for a race like that.

449
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,090
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little? You're not little.

450
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,560
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, not to me.

451
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,300
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart, you've never seen one of these races.

452
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,440
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's hundreds of people there. Everybody from school.

453
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,840
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean...

454
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,840
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...what if you lost?

455
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,650
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least you'll have been somewhere.

456
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,510
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, George. What do you say?

457
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,580
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get started.

458
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,050
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know...

459
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,620
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I'm not sure I want a brother.

460
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,460
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about a friend?

461
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,190
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I can always use a friend.

462
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,800
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-George? -Yes, Dad?

463
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,300
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you seen Stuart?

464
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,560
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's down here with me.

465
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,370
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing to him?

466
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,540
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's helping me finish the Wasp.

467
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,640
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's wonderful, son.

468
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,110
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's terrific.

469
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,550
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't race her like this. Right, George?

470
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,620
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

471
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,620
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-When's the next race? -Two days.

472
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:05,990
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two days?

473
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,660
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll be ready.

474
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,160
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Let's all go together. -A wonderful idea.

475
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-That would be great. -All of us together.

476
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,560
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The whole family.

477
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,800
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The whole family.

478
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,640
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm telling you, Snowy, this guy can fix anything.

479
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,710
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they're alley cats: mean, vicious and all hopped up on catnip.

480
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,260
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quit being a scaredy-cat.

481
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,910
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna get rid of the mouse?

482
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,110
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course I do.

483
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,620
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, then.

484
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,150
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Smokey!

485
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,190
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smokey, it's me. It's me, Monty.

486
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,260
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it?

487
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,150
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, my friend Snowbell here needs a favor.

488
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,690
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snowbell?

489
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,730
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a manly name.

490
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:49,370
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, sir, I've got this mouse at home I can't eat.

491
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,930
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sensitive stomach?

492
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,910
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. I can't eat him, because he's a member of the family.

493
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,870
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A mouse with a pet cat?

494
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,670
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't that funny?

495
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,670
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not funny.

496
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,280
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's sick.

497
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,780
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A cat can't have a rodent for a master.

498
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,920
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, it's against the laws of nature.

499
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,920
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Word of this gets out, it'll be bad for cats all over.

500
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,390
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you help me?

501
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,290
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Consider it done.

502
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,190
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you hear that, Monty? Thank you, Mr. Smokey, sir.

503
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll never forget this. Really.

504
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,040
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, Tinkerbell. I'm all over it.

505
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,340
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tinkerbell. He called me Tinkerbell.

506
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,410
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You're a funny guy. -Whatever.

507
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,840
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jeez, house cats.

508
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,340
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll keep this hush-hush?

509
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,170
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You kidding?

510
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:39,050
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cat's got his tongue. Get it?

511
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,280
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cat's got his tongue because he's a cat.

512
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,350
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Shut up. -Okay.

513
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,490
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ahoy, fellow yachtsmen.

514
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,560
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And welcome, everyone, to the 92nd annual...

515
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,760
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Central Park Boat Race...

516
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:57,840
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...undoubtedly model racing's most prestigious event.

517
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,300
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Children from all over New York gather here every year...

518
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,480
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...to see whose boat will prevail.

519
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,140
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who will win the race and take home the magnificent trophy?

520
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,320


521
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,850
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Anchor up? -Check.

522
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,780
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Stays all battened? -Check.

523
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,050
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Rudder? -Check.

524
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,290
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Sail? -Check.

525
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,450
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're doing checks.

526
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,930
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}George, Stuart, would you like a hot dog?

527
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,300
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check.

528
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,030
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And from Manhattan's Upper West Side...

529
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,360
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the Wasp, piloted by George Little.

530
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,640
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything appears to be in shipshape.

531
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:39,000
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But to be on the safe side, I'll check the hull for leaks.

532
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,650
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. Anton.

533
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,440
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gee, George,

534
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what did you do? Get that out of a cereal box?

535
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,150
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm glad you're here, George.

536
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,790
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone's gotta finish last.

537
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,560
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't like that child.

538
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,000
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All set to get under way.

539
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,100


540
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,540
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's time to get those boats in the water and grab your remote.

541
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,010
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart, get the remote.

542
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,010
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye-aye, captain.

543
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,600
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't she look great?

544
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,540
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?

545
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,770
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Maybe we should go home. -Why?

546
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,020
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not wearing my lucky underwear.

547
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,080
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have lucky underwear.

548
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:57,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we should get some and then come back for another race.

549
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,470
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, I know how worried you are about losing, believe me.

550
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,670
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you know what we say? The thing that matters...

551
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,810
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is to never stop trying. Okay?

552
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,410
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the spirit.

553
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone to your places. The race is about to start.

554
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,360
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Stuart?

555
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,360
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look out, sir!

556
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,060
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart, are you hurt?

557
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,760
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What happened? -It was my fault. I couldn't grip it.

558
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,770
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice going, Captain Loser.

559
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,510
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}George, wait.

560
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,750
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, honey. Everything will be all right.

561
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,720
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it won't.

562
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:10,360
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we could fix it. A little glue. Who'll know?

563
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom.

564
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,070
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is awful. Our first family outing.

565
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,970
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I ruined everything.

566
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,540
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you know, Stuart...

567
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,930
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...these things happen.

568
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:27,080
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what about George?

569
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,380
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be right back.

570
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,790
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}George, you know what?

571
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,580
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because we can't be in the race

572
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,400
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}doesn't mean our family outing has to be ruined.

573
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:51,660
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All boats to your marks. Ready, and...

574
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,400
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the race is on.

575
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,000
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we should just go home.

576
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,470
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sails are full and...

577
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,410
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a mouse on that boat?

578
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,820
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

579
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,080
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sailing. I hope.

580
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,590
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart, come back here.

581
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,200
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I can't. -Why not?

582
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know how!

583
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,970
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The players are jockeying for position.

584
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,360
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frederick, I don't like this one bit.

585
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,400
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your mother doesn't like this.

586
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,470
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm okay, Mom!

587
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,940
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go, Stuart!

588
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,510
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tighten the mainsail!

589
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,180
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's a mainsail?

590
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,620
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move!

591
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,390
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Stuart!

592
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,720
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Gee, George, you all done crying? -Yeah.

593
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-You all done being a jerk? -No.

594
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,630
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, George! I won't let you down!

595
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:56,670
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Away those boats are sailing...

596
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,850
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frederick, what if he falls?

597
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,540
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, he's quite a fine swimmer.

598
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,440
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's cheating. You can't do that.

599
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,770
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I just did.

600
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,810
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dear.

601
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:23,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What is he doing? -I think he's hiking out.

602
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,160
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hope that mouse can swim.

603
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,040
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Wasp is taking the lead. -Stuart, look out!

604
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,350
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That can't be good.

605
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look what that stupid mouse did to my sail.

606
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,680
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not a stupid mouse.

607
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,160
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right. He's a stupid rat.

608
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,540
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Hey, come on. -Get off me. Get off!

609
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something's wrong.

610
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,570
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's happening?

611
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,140
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is that mouse anyway?

612
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,170
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's no mouse. That's my brother.

613
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,190
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little high, Little low!

614
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,260
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little hey, Little ho!

615
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:51,030
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frederick, look at them.

616
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,370
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what?

617
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,810
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This calls for a picture.

618
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,780
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong?

619
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,720
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's just...

620
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,190
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you four look great together.

621
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,060
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the happiest moment of my life.

622
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,390
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel 1 0 inches tall.

623
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,200
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll get that.

624
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,710
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Mr. Little. -Yes?

625
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,310
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Down here.

626
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very sorry to disturb you at your lovely abode.

627
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,380
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope we're not intruding.

628
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:45,720
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name's Reginald Stout. This is my wife, Camille.

629
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,650
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An extreme pleasure.

630
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,690
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're looking for Stuart.

631
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,790
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you friends of his?

632
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,090
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, not exactly.

633
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,790
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Fellow yachtsmen? -Guess again.

634
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,730
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Reggie, just tell them.

635
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,770
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're his parents.

636
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,020
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Reggie, stop it!

637
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,690
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's so good to see you again, Stuart.

638
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:25,720
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's so much we have to catch up on.

639
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,360
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why didn't you want me?

640
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,760
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It shames me to say this, but you weren't born into a prosperous home.

641
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:38,270
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right. We couldn't feed you, dear.

642
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,810
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couldn't feed him? How much could he eat?

643
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:42,280
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}George, please.

644
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,420
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Letting you go was the toughest choice we ever made.

645
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:48,620
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-It was? -Yes.

646
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,220
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now we can be a family again.

647
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Absolutely. Are these salted?

648
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,390
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dear.

649
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The children.

650
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,770
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}George, Stuart, I think we need to talk to the Stouts alone.

651
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,510
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry. Mom and Dad will take care of it.

652
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,270
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid there's been a mistake.

653
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,280
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart can't leave with you. He's...

654
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,180
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-One of the family. -Exactly.

655
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,710
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You may feel like he's family,

656
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,830
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but he'll never really be family.

657
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:31,400
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You may not realize it, but I'm sure he does.

658
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,550
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's something you'll never be able to give him,

659
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,590
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because you're human.

660
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,330
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a place that you'll never be able to fill.

661
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,470
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An empty space.

662
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,070
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom...

663
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,350
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Dad, you want me to leave?

664
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,450
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

665
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:52,280
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dear, we just want what's best for you.

666
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,350
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Stuart lives here.

667
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:56,890
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}George, come on. This is hard for all of us.

668
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:58,450
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This stinks!

669
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,290
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand.

670
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,360
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought I was in a fairy tale.

671
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:10,900
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fairy tales are made-up stories, Stuart.

672
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,940
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is real. This is about where you belong.

673
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:17,610
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please come home, Stuart. Your real home.

674
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:21,040
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're gonna love it, son. We live on a golf course!

675
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,220
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We look right over the ninth fairway! -It's beautiful.

676
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,910
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beautiful.

677
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,920
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taxi!

678
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:34,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's a mouse have to do to get a cab in this city?

679
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,030
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll speak to George for me, won't you?

680
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,100
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd hate to say goodbye to a basement door.

681
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,440
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course.

682
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,010
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taxi!

683
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,770
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, taxi!

684
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:00,610
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time to go, Stuart!

685
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,190
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye.

686
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,790
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We love you.

687
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,840
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you too, Mom.

688
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Little.

689
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,170
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boy, that looks heavy.

690
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:05,450
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need some help with that? Camille?

691
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:10,050
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frederick, let's do something.

692
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,190
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

693
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:15,260
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just make them go away. We're bigger than they are.

694
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,290
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll say, "Go. Shoo." We'll scare their little whiskers off.

695
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,460
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eleanor, you're not being rational.

696
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,930
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rational, shmational.

697
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,040
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something about this is not right. I just know it.

698
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,330
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at them. They just fit.

699
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:29,850
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So what? I have shoes that fit

700
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,010
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I hate them! As Stuart's mother...

701
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,730
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you're not.

702
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,240
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She is.

703
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,490
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait!

704
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:53,300
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to have this.

705
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,310
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not the roadster, George.

706
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,870
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You love this car. I couldn't.

707
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,570
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you to.

708
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,900
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks, George.

709
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,040
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish you didn't have to go.

710
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,870
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna miss you.

711
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,070
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll miss you too, George.

712
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:32,620
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When the moon hits your eye Like a big pizza pie

713
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:34,770
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's amore

714
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,020
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sing with me, Stuie.

715
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,200
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When the world seems to shine Like you had too much wine

716
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:49,710
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll have to tell me your favorite foods so I can fix them for you.

717
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,540
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What for? You can't cook.

718
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,810
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I can learn. We're a family now.

719
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:58,420
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And there's adjustments we'll have to make. Right, Reggie?

720
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,090
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, Camille.

721
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,620
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, here we are, Stuie, the family home.

722
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,560
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The family home.

723
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,360
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The family home.

724
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,530
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mind you, this is just our summer place.

725
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,820
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Winter, we live in a crawlspace above a delicatessen.

726
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,730
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You like corned beef?

727
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,670
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How's it prepared? -Prepared?

728
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,970
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It drops out of a fat guy's mouth, we grab it and run.

729
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:18,640
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sounds like an acquired taste.

730
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:22,350
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Acquired taste? I love this kid!

731
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,640
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your new bedroom, Stuart.

732
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,440
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We hope you like it.

733
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,350
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, good night. Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite.

734
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:38,790
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm serious about those bedbugs. Keep an eye open.

735
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:29,010
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's very kind of you to check on us like this.

736
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:32,510
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, I had something to tell you.

737
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:36,510
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But first, how are things going?

738
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,210
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been difficult.

739
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,390
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Difficult?

740
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,920
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, very difficult.

741
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,390
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very difficult?

742
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:43,420
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Worse.

743
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:44,960
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Worse than very difficult?

744
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,630
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Yes, it's been almost... -Unbearable.

745
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:50,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just the word I was looking for.

746
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:53,900
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe this isn't a good time then.

747
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,770
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, I came over to give you some news.

748
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:58,100
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What type of news?

749
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:01,270
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They had an accident.

750
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,440
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who?

751
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:03,770
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart's parents.

752
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,380
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My goodness. Well, are they all right?

753
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:10,380
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. They didn't make it.

754
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,220
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. Oh, my!

755
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,650
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What happened? -Well, apparently...

756
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,800
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...they were grocery shopping, canned-food aisle.

757
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,300
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was an unsteady pyramid of cans and it collapsed.

758
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,490
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Took three bag boys to dig them out.

759
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They had to identify them by their dental records.

760
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:28,440
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, how horrible!

761
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:32,070
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cream of mushroom soup. Two-for-one sale.

762
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,400
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a very heavy soup.

763
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:36,480
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How is Stuart taking it?

764
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, he doesn't know.

765
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean no one's told him?

766
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,110
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does he have to know?

767
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,000
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Six months after they don't come back,

768
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,960
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}won't he wonder where they went?

769
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:48,350
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they've been gone for years.

770
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,430
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Years? How is that possible?

771
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,610
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because they died years ago.

772
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:55,190
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which part is confusing you?

773
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,830
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart's parents took him away three days ago.

774
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,130
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Three days ago?

775
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,460
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart's parents died

776
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,740
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in a tragic cream- mushroom-soup incident years ago.

777
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,170
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just told you.

778
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:07,680
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to take this up with the police.

779
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,120
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Little?

780
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:25,460
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Detective Sherman. This is my partner, Detective Allen.

781
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,360
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We understand your son is missing.

782
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:28,830
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for coming.

783
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,630
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They know about the Stouts!

784
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,970
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The jig is up! What will we do?

785
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:35,270
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get ahold of yourself.

786
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:38,410
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm in big...! I'm in deep poopy-do!

787
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:41,410
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calm down. Calm down. Don't get your fur in a bunch.

788
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:42,940
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All we need is a new plan.

789
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:46,410
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We do what we should've done in the first place.

790
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,320
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We scratch him out.

791
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,350
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Scratch him out?

792
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:50,450
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, Smokey!

793
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:51,600
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The police are involved.

794
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,320
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna get kicked out of my house.

795
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,460
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not a street cat. I'm a house cat.

796
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:59,260
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't wanna lose my furry basket or my tinkle ball!

797
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,360
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buddy, pull yourself together.

798
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:03,000
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's settled.

799
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,760
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart Little gets scratched tonight.

800
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:12,670


801
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,580
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Very good.

802
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,050
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. and Mrs. Little, you'll have to come downtown.

803
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:37,290
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Detective Sherman, what are our chances of seeing Stuart again?

804
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,830
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want it straight?

805
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:43,330
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-No. -Absolutely not.

806
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:46,340
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, in that case...

807
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,550
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Stuart's probably home right now waiting for you.

808
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:56,240
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we should hear it a little straighter than that.

809
00:54:58,090 --> 00:54:59,560
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In a case like this...

810
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,780
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...if the kidnappers have not called by now...

811
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:05,490
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...then they're not interested in money.

812
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:08,090
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-What are they interested in? -Kicks.

813
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,160
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly.

814
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,490
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my guess these two sickos...

815
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:15,610
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...are on some kind of cross-country mouse-killing spree.

816
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:18,000
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, thank you.

817
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,710
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can kiss this boy goodbye.

818
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,240
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

819
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:24,240
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's over. The things I've seen.

820
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:27,320
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Phil, where is that book on the grisly photos?

821
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,180
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Believe me, you don't want to see this.

822
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:32,180
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It'll only take a second.

823
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,690
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right off the bat. Look at this one.

824
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,760
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This one kept me awake for weeks.

825
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,140
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did they want?

826
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:04,050
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's the boy?

827
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:05,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

828
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart, wake up.

829
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,690
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Get dressed. -Why?

830
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,200
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We're taking you for a ride. -Where are we going?

831
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,390
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some friends of ours have gathered to meet you.

832
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,330
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A gathering? What should I wear?

833
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:24,440
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't matter. Wear anything.

834
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,740
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Is it formal? -Just put something on!

835
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,750
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is Mom crying?

836
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:37,220
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom? I'm not angry at you for putting me up for adoption.

837
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,130
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now that I'm a Stout again,

838
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:43,050
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll always be here to take care of you.

839
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:47,590
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because that's what families do.

840
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,100
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, they take care of each other.

841
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,970
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell him the truth!

842
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,310
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You made a deal with a cat?

843
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:03,880
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He had us cornered at the bottom of the cup.

844
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,070
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was curtains.

845
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,380
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you agreed to pose as my parents?

846
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:10,520
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You lied and cheated?

847
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:15,220
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You took me away from the Littles just when we were all so happy?

848
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:16,330
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

849
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,820
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's wonderful.

850
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,300
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you missed something.

851
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:25,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why I've been feeling sad. That's why I keep thinking of them!

852
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,200
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not a Stout, I'm a Little!

853
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,000
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Stuart Little!

854
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:34,170
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Stuart Little!

855
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:38,280
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart, please. You have to listen to us.

856
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,380
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The cats have decided you're too risky to keep around.

857
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:43,580
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They ordered us to hand you over to them.

858
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,320
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As your fake father, I order you to run.

859
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:48,820
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-I'll go home. -Home?

860
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:52,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's miles from here. And every cat in the city is looking for you.

861
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,070
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides, you could get lost.

862
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,270
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I can't.

863
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:00,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every Little in the world can find the Little house.

864
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,100
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye, fake father!

865
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:06,840
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye, fake mother!

866
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,540
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye, fake son.

867
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:09,840
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye, Stuart.

868
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,780
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna miss that boy.

869
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:15,140
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna miss that car.

870
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:25,790
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Well, I think we have to... -Tell him.

871
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,400
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Who has the glue? -I'm the glue man.

872
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:37,200
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on?

873
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,610
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-We're making posters. -We'll put them up all over the city.

874
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:43,250
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They describe Stuart and offer a reward.

875
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,710
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Isn't it wonderful?

876
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was all George's idea.

877
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:57,630
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never stop trying. Right, Dad?

878
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,730
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, I'm afraid this isn't gonna work.

879
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:03,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not?

880
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:06,800
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Frederick.

881
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:12,510
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because there's no picture. We need a picture of Stuart.

882
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,080
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The family photo.

883
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,920
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smokey. Hey, Smokey.

884
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:30,360
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep it down.

885
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,090
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's me, Lucky.

886
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,990
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just heard from the Brooklyn cats. Bad news. The Stouts squealed.

887
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,830
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew those mice were rats.

888
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,130
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The kid's on his way home. What do we do?

889
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,170
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No problem. He's got to go through the park, right?

890
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:45,470
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's meet him and have ourselves a little picnic.

891
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:47,410
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. I'll bring herring.

892
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:50,880
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Moron! The mouse is the picnic.

893
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:14,760


894
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,780
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every Little in the world can find the Little house.

895
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:01,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a Little. I'm a Little.

896
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:03,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a little lost.

897
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:24,060
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How you doing?

898
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:25,740
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must be Stuart.

899
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:29,240
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, I must be going.

900
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:30,780
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's your hurry, Murray?

901
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,340
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, where are you going, Murray... Stuart?

902
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,540
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's his name?

903
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,510
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come back here, you little rat!

904
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,320
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's getting away!

905
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lucky, Red, get him!

906
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,630
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He's going backwards! -He's a hell of a driver!

907
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:46,390
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Go, go, go, go! -We got him!

908
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,900
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got him, Smokey. Yeah, I got him.

909
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:52,730
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only thing that you guys got are big mouths.

910
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So shut up and run!

911
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:02,480
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Geronimo! -Banzai!

912
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,880
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got him now!

913
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,830
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got him! I got him!

914
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:15,620
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him, Red!

915
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:28,000
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope he runs out of gas!

916
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,070
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you do.

917
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,280
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Why don't you run in the back? -I can't help it.

918
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:32,940
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a nervous stomach.

919
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,610
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I have an empty stomach! Now, get that mouse!

920
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:50,920
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you see that? Damn.

921
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:53,150
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody could've survived that. Right, boss?

922
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,890
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, the mouse is sleeping with the fishes.

923
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,070
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Long, wet nap.

924
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,660
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sewer rat's alive! After him!

925
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:04,310
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No way. I'm a cat. I don't do water.

926
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:05,700
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Red, you go.

927
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,210
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. You want to do water, hire a spaniel.

928
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,580
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe this.

929
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:12,440
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you guys, a bunch of house cats?

930
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,560
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no! Oh, dear.

931
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,100
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dear.

932
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:43,710
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crenshaw, Tina, Uncle Stretch, you go uptown.

933
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:45,850
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cover as many streets as you can.

934
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:48,570
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Edgar, Beatrice, Spencer,

935
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:50,010
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you take downtown.

936
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:52,280
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every side street and back alley.

937
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:54,560
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Estelle.

938
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:57,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You better go with them.

939
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:01,430
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do I go?

940
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,530
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You come with us. We'll circle the park.

941
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:26,820
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I made it.

942
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:30,520
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe it. I'm home.

943
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,220
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom! Dad!

944
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:34,090
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm coming!

945
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:53,350
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's me, Stuart! I'm back!

946
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,790
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is everybody?

947
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:03,520
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nobody else here.

948
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,450
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just you and me, kid.

949
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:08,020
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where'd they go?

950
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:10,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Movies, I think.

951
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,030
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Movies?

952
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,400
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ever since you left,

953
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,110
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's just movies, parties...

954
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:17,810
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...roller-skating, amusement parks.

955
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,600
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're having the time of their lives.

956
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,970
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-They are? -Oh, sure.

957
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:28,140
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate to have to tell you this, but they're celebrating.

958
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:30,020
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Celebrating what?

959
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:31,210
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't you guess?

960
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:32,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

961
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,680
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were just so happy to get rid of you.

962
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:39,560
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a lie! I don't believe that.

963
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,250
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, boy.

964
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:45,870
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish I could spare you this. This is gonna break your heart.

965
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,400
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look up there.

966
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,270
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At what?

967
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,510
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See for yourself.

968
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,490
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They did that right after you left.

969
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:23,140
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Little said, "Who wants to look at that face anymore?"

970
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,330
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-She did? -Yeah.

971
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:29,410
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-And George? -She gave it to him, and he tore it up.

972
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:31,510
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-He did? -Yeah.

973
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,370
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd give you the pieces,

974
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:34,840
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but Mr. Little set them on fire.

975
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:39,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I tried to warn you, Stuart. I told you it wasn't gonna work out.

976
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,890
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should've known.

977
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:44,390
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was too good to be true.

978
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,520
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What're you going to do now?

979
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:48,630
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. I guess I'll...

980
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:50,770
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave immediately? Good idea.

981
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:52,670
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll tell the family you dropped by,

982
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:55,700
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}although it'll probably make them sick.

983
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,380
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye, Snowbell.

984
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:16,890
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye, buddy.

985
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,490
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is killing me.

986
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:25,360
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm almost done.

987
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:28,040
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, it's getting late. Time to go home.

988
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,970
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think I missed a single tree.

989
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:31,370
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did a great job.

990
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:33,270
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a good idea, wasn't it?

991
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:35,000
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You bet it was.

992
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:37,340
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a really good picture of Stuart.

993
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:40,520
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think you could take a bad picture of Stuart.

994
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,680
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now all we have to do...

995
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:44,570
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is wait until somebody calls

996
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:47,260
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and tells us where Stuart is.

997
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

998
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:44,140
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we don't find Stuart, it's gonna break his heart.

999
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,420
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Snow!

1000
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:52,420
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A guy spotted Stuart in the park. Smokey sent me to get you.

1001
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:55,720
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gee, Monty, I'm in for the night. It's late.

1002
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:59,050
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides, Stuart is gone. Can't we just give the kid a break?

1003
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,700
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We could give him a break.

1004
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:04,890
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First we'll break his arms, then his legs, and then we'll take a break.

1005
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,700
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First we gotta find him. Come on, we gotta run!

1006
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:10,870
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do we have to run? What is it, festival seating?

1007
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,070
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! I think we're getting closer.

1008
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:16,340
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can smell him.

1009
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:18,010
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, Smokey, that was me.

1010
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,480
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't your mothers warn you

1011
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,310
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not to go into Central Park at night?

1012
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,450
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mother was the reason

1013
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:24,450
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you didn't go into Central Park at night.

1014
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:26,620
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you tell them, Smokey.

1015
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:29,880
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-She was one tough broad. -She was a saint.

1016
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:34,360
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quick question. Who knows CPR?

1017
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:37,330
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mouse prints are going everywhere.

1018
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:39,370
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-How will we find him? -We'll split up...

1019
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:42,370
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and go in different directions. What a brain.

1020
01:09:42,610 --> 01:09:44,670
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is why he is gatto di tutti i gatti.

1021
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,810
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys go ahead.

1022
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:50,010
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll just collapse right here.

1023
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,530
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart, is that you?

1024
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:07,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing up there?

1025
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:09,500
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm settling in.

1026
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:11,740
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart, you got to get out of here.

1027
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:13,430
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Central Park. It's dark.

1028
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:15,370
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are hungry cats all over the place.

1029
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:17,670
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Where are you? -Look. It's your pal, Monty.

1030
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:19,210
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's he doing here?

1031
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:20,300
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll hear you.

1032
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,880
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why shouldn't he hear me?

1033
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:26,440
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snowbell! Buddy! What're you doing up there?

1034
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:29,240
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. Perfect.

1035
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:34,720
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You found him. Attaboy! Hey, everybody!

1036
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,420
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Over here! Hey, guys!

1037
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:38,390
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snow found him!

1038
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,190
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice going, house cat.

1039
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:43,870
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just for that, when we carve up the mouse, you'll get the big half.

1040
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:47,160
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big half? Snowbell, what's he talking about?

1041
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,500
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know those cats?

1042
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:50,610
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not really.

1043
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:51,830
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We went to a few parties, but...

1044
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:53,370
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the matter?

1045
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:54,770
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you waiting for?

1046
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,280
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring him down! I'm starving!

1047
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:02,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, kid.

1048
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:04,750
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, no! Stop!

1049
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,220
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put me down!

1050
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:09,820
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hit me! I'm open! I'll break his fall with my mouth!

1051
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:11,720
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess you do know them.

1052
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let him go! I can almost taste him!

1053
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,230
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you waiting for?

1054
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:17,790
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you going?

1055
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,870
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's hogging the mouse.

1056
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:20,730
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him!

1057
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:22,100
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's getting away!

1058
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:23,970
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Let's get him! -Go! Go!

1059
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:27,570
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snowbell. Watch it, watch it. Where are you going?

1060
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:29,240
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold that branch for me.

1061
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:31,070
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of my face.

1062
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,410
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him!

1063
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,710
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You saved me?

1064
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:44,790
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get one thing straight. I'm doing this for the Littles.

1065
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,050
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They love you. George loves you.

1066
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:49,760
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're all miserable without you.

1067
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,090
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, Snowbell, you said...

1068
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:53,700
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know what I said.

1069
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:57,970
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I lied, okay? Welcome to Manhattan.

1070
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,940
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the one that hates you.

1071
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:04,680
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do care.

1072
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:12,650
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, okay. That's enough.

1073
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:14,620
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snow, what's he doing to your leg?

1074
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't help but think this is wrong.

1075
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:20,460
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell's going on?

1076
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:25,160
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, Smokey, call me fickle, but...

1077
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:28,100
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I want to call this whole thing off, okay?

1078
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,870
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too late.

1079
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:31,790
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Smokey.

1080
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:33,840
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't we talk it over?

1081
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,150
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuart's not so bad

1082
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:36,210
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}once you get to know him.

1083
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:38,110
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he's got his own car.

1084
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,580
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Careful, house cat. You're asking for it.

1085
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:42,240
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snow, what are you doing?

1086
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,120
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! He's just a mouse.

1087
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,980
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not "just a mouse." He's...

1088
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:50,290
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...he's...

1089
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:52,720
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...he's family.

1090
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:56,660
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could see the resemblance.

1091
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,480
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that what you think?

1092
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,630
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to look alike to be family?

1093
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:06,010
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have to look alike.

1094
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:08,680
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have to like each other. Look at him.

1095
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,810
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He hates me. And still, he's trying to save me.

1096
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,020
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure, you'll probably scratch him up pretty bad.

1097
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:19,450
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You may even kill him, but Snowbell will not run away.

1098
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:23,150
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that is what family is all about.

1099
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,590
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right?

1100
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:29,730
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe "family" is too strong a word.

1101
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:31,760
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Scratch them both. -Both?

1102
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,830
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's me you want! Come and get me!

1103
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:38,800
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go!

1104
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:42,880
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him!

1105
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:47,520
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out of my way!

1106
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:51,850
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him! He's getting away!

1107
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:04,930
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is he? Did he fall in the water?

1108
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,470
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw something hit.

1109
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:10,130
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, did you see that? Gone. He just disappeared.

1110
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:11,370
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he is!

1111
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,080
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Up there!

1112
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:16,070
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's too far. I can't reach him.

1113
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:21,010
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In that case, you can all go home. Prowl safely.

1114
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:24,890
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here you go, boys. Dinner's served.

1115
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:26,580
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, Smokey. Way to go!

1116
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:28,090
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, dear.

1117
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,890
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look. It's mouse on a stick. I love mouse on a stick.

1118
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:35,960
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A little further. Keep him coming. Keep him coming.

1119
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:37,500
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can almost reach him.

1120
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:39,070
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep it coming.

1121
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:40,670
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got him. He's mine.

1122
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,670
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The branch is gonna...

1123
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:50,010
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what have we got here?

1124
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:52,510
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Snow, don't come out here! The branch is breaking!

1125
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:57,150
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}-Are you all right? -Yeah, I'm okay.

1126
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:59,250
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just hang on. I'll take it from here.

1127
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:00,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take what?

1128
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,260
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Snow. You wouldn't do this to me.

1129
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:10,170
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not your old buddy.

1130
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:13,860
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, buddy. I'm sure you'll...

1155
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:45,350
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beaten by a mouse and his pet cat.

1156
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,460
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What could be worse?

1157

{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about not kicking me in the sides? I'm beginning to bruise.

1163

{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. I was getting excited.

1164
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:13,150
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never ridden a cat bareback before.

1165
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,950
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, don't get used to it.

1166
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,850
{\fnCambria\fs21\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on, cowboy.

1167
