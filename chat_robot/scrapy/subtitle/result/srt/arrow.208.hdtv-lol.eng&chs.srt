1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,170
我叫Oliver Queen
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,960
经历岛上地狱般的五年后
After five years on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,300
我回来了 心怀一个目标...
I have come home with only one goal...

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,460
拯救这座城市
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,700
但为此我不能再像以前一样杀戮
But to do so, I can't be the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:22,030
为了祭奠我的好友 我必须重塑自己
To honor my friend's memory, I must be someone else.

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:21,500
{\an8}Thomas Merlyn之墓 1985-2013

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,760
我必须伪装自身
I must be something else.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,200
"绿箭侠"前情提要...
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,630
被告人被判定无罪
The defendant is found not guilty.

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,460
你好 Moira
Hello, Moira.

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,730
Malcolm 你到底想怎样?
What do you want, Malcolm?

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,900
Thea是我的女儿
Thea is my daughter.

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,500
这些人找一艘七十年前的潜艇干什么?
What do these guys want with a seven year old sub?

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,430
它运载的东西 能够拯救人类
What's on it, it'll save the human race.

16
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,000
能拯救他吗?
Will it save him?

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,660
长官 事情有进展
Sir, there's been a development.

18
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,430
Cyrus兄弟...
Brother Cyrus...

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,930
感觉如何?
How do you feel?

20
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,760
更加强壮了
Stronger.

那是什么?
What was that?

24
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,160
绿箭侠 第二季 第八集

25
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,460
Queen夫人 欢迎回到公司
Mrs. Queen, welcome back to the company.

26
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,160
- 谢谢  - 你今天真美
- Thank you.  - You look fabulous.

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,230
真的 比以前更美了 你做了头发吗?
Really, better than ever. Did you do something to your hair?

28
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,960
是的 没有狱友和守卫的监视
Yes, I shampooed it without eight women

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,330
我痛快地洗了个头发
and a guard watching me.

30
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,630
我是不是不该笑? 有人告诉我
Is it ok to laugh? Because I was ordered

31
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,400
为了避免尴尬 不要和你提坐牢的...
not to say anything about you being in prison, just to avoid any awkward...

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,860
- 事情  - 这就很尴尬了
- exchanges.  - Like that one.

33
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,260
好吧
Right.

34
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,300
在财政赤字之前 我们应该研究一下这些数据
We need to drill down on these numbers before the earnings call.

35
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,030
Oliver 我不知道
Oliver. I didn't realize

36
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,060
你母亲今天会到访
your mother was stopping by for a visit today.

37
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,360
她不是来访问的 这也是她的公司
Well, it's not a visit. This is her company, too.

38
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,600
当然了
Of course.

39
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,860
你好吗 Moira?
How are you, Moira?

40
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,600
平安回来了 Isabel
Back, Isabel.

41
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,560
Queen先生 能借一步说话吗?
Mr. Queen, may I speak to you for a minute?

42
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,600
如果我们再把Queen实业
What sort of message does it send

43
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,830
交给你母亲领导
to the investment committee, to the city,

44
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,830
调查委员会和市民们会怎么想?
if we hand Queen consolidated right back to your mother?

45
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,400
- 她被无罪释放了  - 陪审团说她无罪
- She was acquitted.  - By a jury.

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,060
市民们可不这么想 Oliver
Not by the city. Oliver.

47
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,600
你不仅是一个儿子
Stop thinking like a son

48
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,400
更是这家公司的首席执行官
and start thinking like a CEO.

49
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,760
Oliver啊
Oliver.

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,100
有抢劫发生
There's been a break-in.

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,400
该死!
Damn!

52
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,060
这扇门是用超强钛合金制成的
This door is made of expanded reinforced titanium.

53
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,130
他们是怎么弄破的?
What did they use to do this?

54
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,630
还不清楚 没有爆炸的痕迹
Not sure yet. No sign of any explosives.

55
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,700
也许是用吊车 或是铲车
Maybe a crane, maybe a forklift.

56
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,260
我猜测他们至少有三个人 也可能是四个
I'm guessing there was at least three of them, maybe four.

57
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,100
而他们进出的时间说明...
And given how quick they got in and out of here...

58
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,360
他们手法很快
they were fast.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
哇 嘿 等一下!
Whoa, hey, stop, wait!

60
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,500
怎么回事啊?
What's wrong there?

61
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,300
你知道他们为什么那么热衷于抢劫吗?
Any idea what these guys were so hot to break in here for?

62
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,100
你把一台空闲的地震仪放在这里
You didn't happen to leave a spare earthquake machine

63
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,230
肯定有目的吧?
lying around, did you?

64
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,030
不好意思
Sorry.

65
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:16,060
这是监控录像里的片段
This is what we're able to pull off the security cameras.

66
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,630
我们只拍到了他自己
He was the only guy we got on video.

67
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,760
他的同伙应该随后才到
The rest of the crew must have come in after him.

68
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,860
其实 只有一个人
Actually, it was only one guy.

69
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,130
不好意思 我来晚了
Ah, sorry I'm late.

70
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,330
因为第二辆火车晚点了
But actually, my train was late. Well, the second one.

71
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,500
第一辆我没赶上 都怪那个出租车司机
The first one I did miss, but that was my cab driver's fault.

72
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,700
我查了电子地图...
I've got this great traffic app, and...

73
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,000
但是司机坚持说他才是对的
but he thought that he was right.

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,960
不过谢天谢地 我来了
I'm here now, though. So.

75
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,430
好极了 你是谁啊?
Great. Who the hell are you?

76
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,960
你父母知道你来这里吗?
And do your parents know that you're here?

77
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,730
我是Barry Allen
I'm Barry Allen.

78
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,000
来自警察厅总部
I'm from the central city police department.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,700
我是犯罪现场调查科的
I'm with the crime scene investigation unit.

80
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,230
我们在查一个案子
We're working on a case with some similar

81
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,700
中心城发现了一些类似的神秘元素
unexplained elements in central city,

82
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,230
所以当在系统里看到这里抢劫案的记录
so when the report of your robbery came over the wire,

83
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,660
我的上司就把我派来了
my captain sent me up here.

84
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,400
你以为这扇们就像锡纸一样
And you think one guy ripped through this door

85
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,060
一个人就能进去?
like it was tin foil?

86
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,100
一个很强壮的人就能进去
One very strong guy, yeah.

87
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,960
扭断一个人的脖子需要大约
Uh, it takes about 1,250 foot pounds of torque

88
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,900
1250尺磅的力量
to break someone's neck.

89
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,630
你们看到门卫脖子上的伤痕了吗?
You see the marks on the guard's neck?

90
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,760
上面的淤青表明 凶手仅用一只手就把他掐死了
The bruising pattern suggests the killer used only one hand.

91
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,260
我猜你肯定不知道
I'm guessing you don't know how hard it is

92
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,460
扭断一个人的脖子有多不容易
to break someone's neck.

93
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,700
嗯? 不 我不知道
Hmm? No. No idea.

94
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,660
我们需要一份物品清单
Uh, we're going to need a list of the entire inventory here

95
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,060
对照确认一下丢失的物品
to figure out exactly what was stolen.

96
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,830
事实上我知道什么丢了
Actually, I think I know what was stolen.

97
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,830
是一台离心机 工业用离心机
A centrifuge. An industrial centrifuge.

98
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,800
有可能是核心企业2BX 900型号的
Probably the Cord Enterprises 2BX 900.

99
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,400
也许是第六代的
Maybe the six series.

100
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,130
都是三缸系统
Both have a three column base.

101
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,400
看这 有三个被弄坏的螺丝钉
Here, you can see the three sets of broken bolts

102
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,300
小偷... 直接把他们拔了下来
Where the thief just... ripped it out of the ground.

103
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,100
离心机是干什么用的?
And what exactly is a centrifuge?

104
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,730
它能够分离液体
It separates liquids.

105
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,800
不同的向心力使密度大的液体
The centripetal acceleration causes denser substances

106
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,260
向转轴外部移动
to separate out along the radial direction.

107
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,360
这样密度小的液体就被分离出来了
And lighter objects move to the top.

108
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,300
你刚才说你叫什么来着?
What did you say your name was again?

109
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,830
我叫Barry 姓Allen
Barry. Allen.

110
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,800
我是Felicity 姓Smoak
Felicity. Smoak.

111
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,730
裂缝一直
Um, you can see the cracks

112
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,600
延伸到门口 还有脚印
heading towards the door. Footsteps.

113
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,130
只有一个人
One guy.

114
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,200
但这只是我的猜想
Anyway, it's just a theory.

115
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,100
很多证据都说明只有一个人
One backed by a lot of evidence.

116
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,360
肯定还有其他解释
There has to be another explanation.

117
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,560
嗯 你说得对
Yeah. I'm sure you're right.

118
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,830
你可以去通知一下咱们的朋友吗
You might want to fill our mutual friend in on this.

119
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,030
嗯 别担心
Yeah. Don'worry.

120
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,600
我想他已经开始调查了
I'm sure he's already on it.

121
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,630
我们得换个方向
We need to change directions

122
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,260
- 往南10度  - 我们得休息一下
- 10 degrees north.  - We need to rest.

123
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,630
如有Ivo和他的手下没有死光
If Ivo and any of his men survived that blast,

124
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,900
他们肯定在找我们
they'll be tracking us.

125
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,330
我们得接着走
We keep moving.

126
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,860
就停五分钟
Five minutes.

127
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,460
你来照顾一下他
You watch him, please.

128
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,860
好的
Of course.

129
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,860
你相信他们吗?
Do you believe them?

130
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,360
这个回转石能让我们找到那艘破潜艇?
That this hosen will lead us to a wrecked Japanese sub?

131
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,200
这是Ivo的想法
Ivo seems to think so.

132
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,530
我只希望能在潜艇上
I just hope whatever miracle serum

133
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,300
找到那个万能血清
they're after is actually onboard.

134
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,300
他很需要
For his sake.

135
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,130
你了解那个女孩吗?
How do you know that girl?

136
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,360
在我爸的船上...
Sara was on my father's boat...

137
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,400
Sara和我在一起
with me.

138
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,100
那照片上的那个女孩呢?
What about the girl in the picture?

139
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,660
是叫Laurel吗?
Laurel?

140
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,230
你说你很爱的那个女孩
The girl you told me you were in love with.

141
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,030
Sara是她妹妹
Sara is her sister.

142
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,660
我想去走走
I feel like taking a walk.

143
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,730
谁想一起去?
Anyone care to join me?

144
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,760
看来这些年发生了不少事情
I guess a lot's happened in the last year.

145
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,200
Oliver啊
Oliver.

146
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,660
从应用科学部拿到了物品清单
Got the final inventory from Applied Sciences.

147
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,730
那个中央警局犯罪调查科的人说的没错
That CSI from central city was right.

148
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,030
只有一样东西被偷 离心机
The only thing missing is a centrifuge.

149
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,530
看看这个 我从应用科学部对街的
You have to see this. I pulled up CC traffic camera footage

150
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,830
监控录像里找到的
from across the street of Applied Sciences.

151
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,130
这是警报器响了三分钟的时候
This is three minutes after the alarm went off.

152
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,900
有什么能帮你的吗 警官?
Can we help you with something, detective?

153
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,400
哦 犯罪科的人算不上是警官
Oh, CSIs aren't actually detectives.

154
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,600
我们都不配枪
We don't even carry guns.

155
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,460
只有一些塑料设备
Just some plastic baggies.

156
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,360
哦 我的设备该放在哪里?
Uh, where should I set up my equipment?

157
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,630
- 我带你去  - 这是什么情况?
- I'll show you.  - What's going on?

158
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,960
你的助手说
Your assistant said that you preferred

159
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,430
你想要在室内进行调查
to keep the investigation in house,

160
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,560
所以我和副巡长清理了现场来帮忙
So I cleared it with my captain to give you a hand.

161
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,260
你在搞什么呢?
What are you doing?

162
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,200
我们要找出入侵者
We need to find this intruder.

163
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,730
而他看起来比我们对此案更了解
And he seems to know more about it than any of us.

164
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,300
鉴证科不是我的专长 所以...
Forensic science isn't exactly my forte, so...

165
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,030
我们需要他的帮助
I'd say we need him.

166
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,660
不是吗?
Wouldn't you?

167
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,300
好吧
Mm-hmm.

168
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,760
我带你转转
I'll show you around.

169
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,000
我怎么觉得你比Felicity的这位新朋友知道的更多呢?
Why am I getting the feeling you know more about this than Felicity's new friend?

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,500
希望我想错了
Pray I'm wrong.

171
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,530
嗨 今早在办公司发生的事
Hi. I'm sorry about what happened

172
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,200
我很抱歉
at the office this morning.

173
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,030
很多人都认为我是侥幸逃过谋杀罪的处罚 Oliver
There are a lot of people who think I got away with murder, Oliver.

174
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,360
可能是吧
Maybe I did.

175
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,860
妈妈 无论是审判 还是所谓的阴谋"大事业"
Mom, the trial, the Undertaking,

176
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,900
还有Malcolm merlyn之类的 这些事情都过去了
Malcolm merlyn, all of that is behind us now.

177
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,430
我们要让别人明白这些
And we need everyone to see that.

178
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,430
- 我们能做什么呢?  - 举办宴会
- How are we going to do that?  - We throw a party.

179
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,530
嗨 Thea 
Thea.

180
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,230
嗨 Roy
Roy.

181
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,000
我好像听到你们在谈论举办宴会的事情 是吧?
Did I hear you guys say something about a party?

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,900
为妈妈举办的宴会 欢迎她回到Queen企业
A welcome back to Queen consolidated party for mom.

183
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,200
我不想举办宴会
I don't think so.

184
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,230
要想让一切回归正轨
If things are going to get back to normal,

185
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,460
那我们就得先回归正常的生活
then we need to start acting normal.

186
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,700
正常的生活就需要举办一场盛宴
Normal for us is a lavish party.

187
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,200
哦 抱歉 Queen夫人 我不能留下来吃早午饭了
Oh. I'm sorry, Mrs. Queen, I can't stay for brunch.

188
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,460
我们要出去一下
I guess we got to go.

189
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,600
回见
Bye.

190
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,460
一切交给我来搞定
I'll take care of everything.

191
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,430
你到底在找什么?
What exactly are you looking for?

192
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,060
入侵者的鞋底接触过地面
Your thief's shoes touched the ground,

193
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,830
这就意味着 他会留下蛛丝马迹
which means he tracked in dozens of clues

194
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,700
让我们能查出最近几天他去过的地方
as to where he's been the past few days.

195
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,460
找到了
Got ya.

196
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,530
马上就好
Shouldn't take long.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,360
你见过他 是吧?
So you've seen him, right?

198
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,430
治安维持者?
The vigilante?

199
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,130
据说他救过你
I read that he saved you.

200
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,200
他长什么样?
What was he like?

201
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,500
一袭绿色装备
Green.

202
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,160
绿色
Green.

203
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,300
很有趣 不是吗?
That's interesting, right?

204
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,200
我是指 他为什么选择绿色呢?
I mean, why green?

205
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,830
黑色能够更好的掩饰身份
Black would be better for stealth,

206
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,400
而迷彩色呢
and urban camouflage.

207
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,960
我个人认为
Me, personally,

208
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,160
他可能是在森林
I think that he trained in some sort of like forest

209
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,830
或者丛林里训练过
or jungle environment,

210
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,000
绿色就是这个象征
and the green is a nod to that.

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,230
我没仔细想过关于治安维持者的事情
I don't give the vigilante much thought.

212
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,330
警察调查显示他用碳钢的箭
Police reports show that he uses carbon arrows,

213
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,360
要是他换成铝碳合金的箭
but if he switched to an aluminum carbon composite,

214
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,560
他的射程能更远
he would have far better penetration.

215
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,800
也许他觉得这样的射程足够了
Maybe he thinks he penetrates just fine.

216
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,000
还想知道更多吗?
Do you want to know something else?

217
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,560
我觉得他有搭档
I think that he has partners.

218
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,730
他的搭档一定很精通计算机技术
Definitely someone with a background in computer sciences.

219
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,030
可能吧
Yeah.

220
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,230
为什么你对治安维持者这么感兴趣?
Why are you so interested in the vigilante?

221
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,760
在我十一岁的时候 妈妈被人谋杀
When I was 11, my mom was murdered.

222
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,060
抱歉
I'm so sorry.

223
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,900
凶手却一直逍遥法外
They never caught the guy who did it.

224
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,830
也许他能将凶手绳之以法
Maybe he would have.

225
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,560
土壤成分... 含有晶状结构
The soil... there's a crystalline structure in it.

226
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,830
真奇怪
That's weird.

227
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,560
哪里不对了?
What's weird?

228
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,900
是糖
It's sugar.

229
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,960
Sin 你说有紧急状况
Sin, you said this was an emergency.

230
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,500
无意冒犯 不过Thea不该来这里
No offense, but Thea, you shouldn't be here.

231
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,160
我为什么不能来我家俱乐部的小巷?
In the alleyway of the club I own?

232
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,360
是关于我朋友Max的事
It's my friend Max.

233
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,730
他失踪了 我们足足一周都没见过他
He's missing. I haven't seen him for a week, no one has.

234
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,600
他一定出了什么事
Something happened to him.

235
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,530
我猜你也许认识能帮上忙的人
I figured you knew someone who could help.

236
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,060
Roy会帮忙的
Roy can help you.

237
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,500
我还以为你不希望我参与这些事呢
I thought you wanted me to stay out of trouble.

238
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,960
我还挺喜欢你路见不平拔刀相助的个性
I kind of like that you never turn away from someone who needs help.

239
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,100
我找人照看一下俱乐部
I'll just get someone to cover the club.

240
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,630
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

241
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,960
哦 我要和你一起行动
Oh, I'm coming with you.

242
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,530
听说你要举办宴会
I hear you're throwing a party.

243
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,860
可是我没收到邀请
I didn't get my invite.

244
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,300
我要到哪里去邀请你呢?
Where exactly should I have addressed it?

245
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,230
Starling市公墓吗?
Starling city cemetery?

246
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,560
我知道 你巴不得我在墓地里腐烂呢
I know that's where you wish I was right now.

247
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,030
我对自己的儿子说谎
Lying beside my son.

248
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,900
难道还要我为你感到难过吗 Malcolm?
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you, Malcolm?

249
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,430
是你害死了Tommy
You killed Tommy.

250
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,360
你害死了自己的儿子
You killed your son.

251
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,330
- 你不能抢走我的女儿  - 是我们的女儿
- You cannot have my daughter.  - Our daughter.

252
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,430
我觉得那一晚我们都很需要人陪
I think we both needed someone that night.

253
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,630
我为做了对不起Rebecca的事情内疚
I felt so bad about betraying Rebecca's memory

254
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,330
于是离开了Starling市
that I left Starling.

255
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,960
离开了Tommy
Left Tommy behind.

256
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,460
我就是那时候去的南峰
That's when I made my way to Nanda Parbat,

257
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,100
在那里我找到了人生新目标
where I found my new purpose.

258
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,300
不得不说 Moira
In a way, Moira,

259
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,330
是你造就了如今的我
You made me the man I am today.

260
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,960
Thea是无辜的
Thea is innocent.

261
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,500
她很爱Robert
She loved Robert.

262
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,000
请你不要把她牵扯进来
Please don't take that away from her,

263
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,460
求求你了
I'm begging you.

264
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,660
Thea是我唯一的牵挂了
Thea is all I have left.

265
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,330
告诉她真相
Tell her the truth,

266
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,830
马上就告诉她
and tell her soon.

267
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,600
有进展吗?
You found something?

268
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,230
我们有新发现
We found something.

269
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,900
在入侵者的鞋印里
There were trace amounts of sucrose

270
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,430
我们发现了一些蔗糖和特殊的污泥成分
and a spec of dirt the killer dragged in here on his boot.

271
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,400
我突然想到  一公里之外有个炼糖厂
Which got me thinking. There is a sugar refinery

272
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,960
在它附近的岛上
two miles from here. The land around it

273
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,830
到处都有废糖料 于是我开始顺藤摸瓜
is suffused in waste sugar. So I checked.

274
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,530
发现几天前 他们有台运输车被盗走了
They had a delivery truck stolen a few days ago.

275
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,230
他们被盗卡车的规格型号
Their truck matches the make and model

276
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,660
与入侵者偷走离心机时用的卡车是一样的
of the truck the thief used to steal the centrifuge.

277
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,300
- 能追踪到那辆车吗?  - 正在追踪
- Can you track the vehicle?  - We've been trying.

278
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,360
那是什么?
What was that?

279
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,530
你一定会震惊的
You're not going to believe this.

280
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,630
那辆被盗的卡车 刚才被用来抢劫血库了
The truck, it was just used to rob a blood bank.

281
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,130
- 你确定吗?  - 确定 
- Are you sure?  - Yeah. Our guy

282
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,130
那家伙刚刚抢劫了三万毫升的阴性O型血
just made off with 30,000 ccs of o-negative.

283
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,460
什么 难道他不仅力大无穷 而且还吸血?
What, he has super strength, likes blood?

284
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,960
别告诉我是吸血鬼现身了
Please don't tell me we suddenly believe in vampires.

285
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,500
我们应该把这个情况报告给警局
We should give this information to the local police.

286
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,030
我... 我去报警 
I'll... take care of that. 

287
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,300
你在中心城也处理过类似的案件吗?
Did you say that you were working a similar case in central city?

288
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,860
差不多
Oh, yeah, um...

289
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,330
是类似的案件
Yeah, you know, it's similar.

290
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,660
线索类似
Has similar elements.

291
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,160
有很多共同点
A lot of similarities.

292
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,830
好吧
Right. Yeah.

293
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,960
帮我查查这个孩子的背景?
I want you to look into this allen kid.

294
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,700
他隐瞒了不少事
There's more to him than he's letting on.

295
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,200
我觉得他图谋不轨
His intentions seem pretty clear to me.

296
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,830
那就交给你了 
Just do it, please.

297
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,330
Oliver 你打算什么时候
Oliver, when are you going to tell me

298
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,900
告诉我事情的内幕?
what exactly we're up against?

299
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,660
哎唷!
Yeooww!

300
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,800
抱歉
Sorry.

301
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,200
啊
Ahh.

302
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,500
谢谢
Thank you.

303
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,700
你猜对了 我是了解一些内幕
You were right to ask if I knew more than I was letting on.

304
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,260
以前 我见过像他这样力大无的人
I've seen men with abilities like that before.

305
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,500
你见过?
You have?

306
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,200
在哪?
Where?

307
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,300
岛上
The island.

308
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,760
我在那逃亡的第二年 我们...
My second year marooned there, we...

309
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,600
我无意中发现了一个
I came across the remains

310
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,030
二战时的日本军事设施
of a japanese world war II military project.

311
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,860
这是一个旨在制造人体武器的血清
It was a serum designed to create human weapons.

312
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,060
人体武器 我去 然后就是外星人了?
Human weapons. My god, what's next, aliens?

313
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,360
这是真的 Diggle
This is real, Diggle.

314
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,000
我在岛上的那五年
Those five years that I was away,

315
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,030
遇见了很多...
I came across things that just...

316
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,660
无法解释的事
defy explanation.

317
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,660
当时有个医生叫Ivo
There's a doctor, his name is Ivo,

318
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,530
他到岛上来
and he came to the island

319
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:50,130
在人身上测试血清
to test the serum on people.

320
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,860
那些活下来的人 他们的忍耐力
The ones that survived, their endurance,

321
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,060
反应和力量都有所提高
reflexes and strength were all enhanced.

322
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,100
你觉得Ivo在starling市?
And you think this Ivo's in starling city?

323
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,330
他已经死了
He's dead.

324
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,560
所有他注射过血清的人都死了
And so is everyone that he injected with the serum.

325
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,200
最后一个... 是我烧死的
The last of which... I burned.

326
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,800
你觉得有人找到了配方
You think someone found the recipe.

327
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,500
那离心机和大量的血液
The centrifuge and a large supply of blood.

328
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,330
我觉得有人想造出更多的血清
I think someone wants to make more of it.

329
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,600
非常多
A lot more.

330
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,830
你咋不接着在阿鲁巴岛上逃亡
Why couldn't you have been marooned on Aruba?

331
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,100
还有第三种组成... 强效镇定剂
There's a third component... a strong sedative.

332
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,600
我还是喜欢你把这玩意
I think I preferred it

333
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,700
留在别人身体里
when you left these in people.

334
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,360
你去分析箭头上的血液
I need you to analyze the blood on the arrowhead.

335
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,500
如果我们找到他们用的是哪种镇定剂
If we can figure out which sedative they're using...

336
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,700
我们就能找到下次劫案会在哪
We can figure out where the next robbery will be.

337
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,200
我和Barry会立即着手
Barry and I will get right on it.

338
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,460
看来她已经被迷住了
I think our Miss Smoak is smitten.

339
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,560
Diggle 你查到Allen的底细了吗?
Diggle, what did you find out about Mr. Allen?

340
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,960
他说了谎
He's not who he says he is.

341
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,400
你还好吧?
How are you holding up?

342
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,100
我想要个更好看的拐杖
I could do with a better looking crutch.

343
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,600
看起来你俩很亲密啊
You two seem like you've gotten pretty chummy.

344
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,400
我们到了
We're here.

345
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,830
水线之下一定有个裂缝
There must be a fissure in the island

346
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,600
才能让它进来那么深
below the waterline for it to come that far inland.

347
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,460
不可思议
Unbelievable.

348
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,600
他们把硝酸放在氨旁边?
They have nitric acid next to hydrazine?

349
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,400
高锰酸放在丙酮上边?
Permanganates on top of acetone?

350
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,930
危险这个词就是这么来的啊
This is the definition of dangerous.

351
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,200
既然这么危险 就别动它们了
If it's so dangerous, maybe you shouldn't be touching them.

352
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,730
Barry啊
Barry.

353
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,730
我从警察局那里拿到
I managed to get a sample

354
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,230
凶手的血样
of the perpetrator's blood from the police department.

355
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,930
我们需要把血液里的血清分离出来
We need to isolate a sedative in the blood.

356
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,130
也许这样能找到那些小偷
It could lead us to the thief.

357
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,560
警察怎么搞到的?
How did the police get it?

358
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,000
很明显绿箭侠用箭射中了他
Apparently the vigilante shot him with an arrow.

359
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,330
真的假的
You're kidding.

360
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,660
你知道这意味着什么吗?
You know what this means, right?

361
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,430
说明绿箭侠在和我们同一个案子!
This means the vigilante's working the same case we are!

362
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,930
自己想象吧
Heh. Go figure.

363
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,760
你又是怎么弄来的?
How did you get it?

364
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,800
Oliver有很多关系
Oliver has a lot of connections.

365
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,960
好吧
Wow.

366
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,800
为一个亿万富翁工作可真方便
Pays to work for a billionaire.

367
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,160
其实我带回家的也没什么特别
Actually my take home's nothing special.

368
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,560
尤其是我很少在家
Especially given I am rarely at home,

369
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,700
每天晚上都和他在一起
since I'm with him every night.

370
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,830
啊 我没注意到你和他...
Ah. Well, I didn't realize you and he were...

371
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,000
不是
Oh, no.

372
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,160
是工作 他... 和我
Work. He... and I

373
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,360
不是 我不喜欢Oliver
are not, no, I do not like Oliver.

374
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
我收到了一个
Um, I was invited

375
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,360
工作站的邀请
to a work function.

376
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,330
是个派对
It's a party.

377
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,130
我能带一个伴一起去
And I have a plus-one.

378
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,630
我觉得带你去...
I was thinking you would make

379
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,830
会很好
a really good... plus-one.

380
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,500
不用跳舞吧?
There's not going to be dancing, is there?

381
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,160
我跳舞实在太丑了
I'm not just not too good on my feet.

382
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,760
哦
Ohh.

383
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,560
一股恶臭
It reeks in here.

384
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,500
我猜你的朋友不是很爱画风景
I guess your friend wasn't too into painting seascapes.

385
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,430
Max和别的饥饿艺术家没什么区别...
Max is like any starving artist...

386
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,060
饥饿
Starving.

387
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:20,160
我没地方去的时候 就来他这
But I could always crash here when I didn't have a place to stay.

388
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,230
这献血是一周以前的事了
Hey, this blood drive was a week ago.

389
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,860
你说他什么时候失踪的?
When did you say he went missing?

390
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,200
就是那天
That day.

391
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,900
我是Daily
It's Daily.

392
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,230
有人在找Mxwell Stanton
Someone's looking for Maxwell Stanton.

393
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,460
他们会找到他的
And they should find him.

394
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,560
明白 Blood兄弟
Yes, Brother Blood.

395
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,100
血液维持着生命
Blood provides life.

396
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,060
血液带来权力
Blood provides power.

397
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,330
有了权力...
And with power...

398
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,660
我就可以为所欲为
there's no limit to what I can do.

399
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,960
中心城还有一天就会创造历史
Central city is just a day away from making history

400
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,960
充满争议的S.T.A.R.实验室的粒子加速器
when the controversial S.T.A.R. Lab's particle accelerator

401
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,060
马上就要启动了
is finally turned on.

402
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,830
很棒吧?
Pretty cool, right?

403
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,800
你知道强子对撞机启动以后
You know there's been a hundred percent increase

404
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,230
地震的频率高了一倍吧
in earthquakes since they've turned on the large hadron collider.

405
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,460
- 这都是误解  - 是吗 说说
- That data is misleading.  - Oh, do tell.

406
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,430
你知道什么是误解 对吧?
You know about misleading, don't you?

407
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,100
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

408
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,660
他不是CSI的人 他只是一个助手
He's not from CSI, he's an assistant.

409
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,760
你的上司还不知道你在Starling市
Whose bosses don't know you're in Starling.

410
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,330
中心城也没有类似的案件

411
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,930
说说吧 Barry...
So tell me, Barry...

412
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,960
你到底想干嘛?
What are you really doing here?

413
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,000
我告诉过你我妈被谋杀了
I told you my mom was murdered.

414
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,760
是你父亲干的
By your father.

415
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,660
他没有
He didn't do it.

416
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,900
你说警察没有找到凶手
You said that the police didn't find the man who killed her.

417
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,800
警察觉得是他干的
The police think they did.

418
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,560
我爸被判了终生监禁
My dad has been serving a life sentence.

419
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,800
他们不相信我
They didn't believe me.

420
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,460
不相信什么?
About what?

421
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,700
我当时11岁
I was 11.

422
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,530
有一天晚上...
One night...

423
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,830
有人闯入了我家 像一阵飓风
something just came into our house, like a tornado.

424
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,330
一团迷雾
A blur.

425
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:33,560
从那迷雾里 我看见一个人
Somewhere inside the blur, I saw a person.

426
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,700
我爸爸和他搏斗
My dad went to fight it.

427
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,530
我想靠近他们 但是突然...
I tried to get 'em when suddenly...

428
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,060
我就在20个街区之外了
I was 20 blocks away from our house.

429
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,600
没有人相信我
Nobody believed me.

430
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,230
他们觉得我是在庇护我爸爸
They thought I was trying to cover for my father.

431
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,460
但我那天晚上看见的
But what I saw that night

432
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,500
千真万确
was real.

433
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,400
和有人赤手空拳
As real as the man that ripped down

434
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,960
撕下那扇铁门一样千真万确
that metal door with his bare hands.

435
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,330
这就是为什么我想介入这样的案子
That's why I look into cases like this.

436
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:16,600
没有人相信的案子
The ones nobody believes are possible.

437
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,530
如果我能搞清楚这样的一个案子
Maybe if I can just make sense of one,

438
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,200
也许就能找到杀我妈妈的凶手
I might be able to find out who really killed my mother.

439
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,930
让我爸爸重获自由
And free my dad.

440
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,900
对不起我骗了你
I am sorry I lied to you.

441
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,930
再找一个伴吧
Better find another plus one.

442
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,730
他喜欢自己冒充的身份
He did like about who he really was.

443
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,030
我们每天都在干什么?
And what do we do everyday?

444
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,360
嘿
Hey.

445
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,500
这里进展如何?
How's everything going in there?

446
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,200
晚上好 Queen氏家族
Good evening, Queens.

447
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,260
- 能借一步说话吗?  - 好的
- Can I have a word?  - Yeah.

448
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:25,660
对不起啊 之前我反应过度了
I'm sorry if I overreacted a little bit earlier.

449
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,600
你也知道?
Oh, you think?

450
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,560
现在你得向你妈妈道歉 不是我
Look, right now, you need to apologize to your mother. Not me.

451
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,930
道什么歉?
For what?

452
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,330
因为你错了
Your being wrong.

453
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:44,500
想来只有在因为谋杀受审的时候
I guess these days, I only draw a crowd

454
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,330
我才能吸引点人吧
when I'm on trial for murder.

455
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,060
妈 你没必要...
Mom, you don't have to...

456
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,400
有客人来就好
We have guests.

457
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,700
不管来得多少
However few of them there are.

458
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,260
这不是你的错 Ollie
This is not your fault, Ollie.

459
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,900
你妈妈怎么样?
How's your mom doing?

460
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,500
我们Queen家族的女人... 没什么会难倒我们
Oh, you know us Queen women... Nothing gets to us.

461
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,100
你可真有你爸的范
You must take after your dad.

462
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,400
抱歉
Sorry.

463
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,830
Sin 什么事?
Sin. What's up?

464
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,260
- 我找到Max了  - 在哪儿?
- I found Max.  - Where?

465
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,160
- 我这就来  - 找到Max了?
- I'm on my way.  - They find Max?

466
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,560
呃 不 
Um, no.

467
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,460
她只是想让我过去下
She just wants me to stop by.

468
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,760
我和你一起去
I can come with you.

469
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,430
你应该待在这 你妈妈需要你
You should stay here. Your Mom needs you.

470
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,130
好了 我迟点打给你
Ok, I'll call you later.

471
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,530
要跳舞吗?
Time for a dance?

472
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,560
不太想和你跳 Oliver
Not really feeling like dancing with you, Oliver.

473
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,760
我懂的
I know.

474
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,400
所以我叫他来了
And that is why I called him.

475
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,360
温馨提示...
FYI...

476
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,900
他会受到公开审问
They will card him at the bar.

477
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,700
- 嗨  - 嗨
- Hi.  - Hi.

478
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,360
说真的我不会跳舞
I was serious about not being able to dance.

479
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,130
但我会牵着你的手晃起来
But I'll hold your hands and sway.

480
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,430
- 同意  - 好的
- Sold.  - Ok.

481
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,460
我警告过你了
I tried to warn you.

482
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,900
我忽略你了
I tried to ignore you.

483
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,760
抱歉 Oliver
I am sorry, Oliver.

484
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,630
好吧
Yeah.

485
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,030
Oliver帮你办了个愉快的聚会
Oliver threw you a lovely party.

486
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,560
Oliver是个孝顺的儿子
Oliver's a good son,

487
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,230
虽然看人不是很准
if not the best judge of character.

488
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:19,260
一切还好吧?
Is everything ok?

489
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,960
一切都很完美
Everything's going perfectly.

490
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:48,930
他命不长了
He doesn't have long.

491
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,430
如果这种特效药在船上 我们必须马上找出来
If this miracle drug is onboard, then we need to find it now.

492
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,960
Slade 我们很快就回来 好吗?
Slade, be back in a few minutes, ok?

493
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,460
我会没事的
I'll just get comfortable.

494
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,160
这边
Come on.

495
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,530
在那
There.

496
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,400
特效药
Mirakuru.

497
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,460
特效药
Miracle.

498
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,760
我从不相信是真的
I was never sure it was real.

499
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,400
如果给Slade吃会怎样?
What happens if we give it to Slade?

500
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,760
他需要先打血液镇定剂
He needs a sedative in his bloodstream first.

501
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,900
他们可能有溴化钾或者巴比妥
They might have potassium bromide or barbital.

502
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,530
喔
Ohh.

503
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,200
是空的
It's empty.

504
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,460
如果不打镇静剂会怎样?
What happens if we give it to him without the sedative?

505
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,400
会怎样 Sarah!
Sarah!

506
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,260
他肯定会死掉
He'll die, for sure.

507
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,530
反正他迟早都会死
He's going to die anyway.

508
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:48,930
什么声音?
What was that?

509
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:52,930
Ivo和他的手下 他们在潜艇上
Ivo and his men. They're on the sub.

510
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,630
- 你联系了吗?  - 联系过了
- Have you made contact?  - Yes.

511
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:04,200
他说接受并感谢你的信息
He said to tell you that your information was gratefully accepted.

512
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,960
谢谢
Thank you.

513
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,630
那是谁?
Who was that?

514
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,260
不用担心
Nothing to worry about.

515
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,760
今晚谢谢你 Oliver 晚会很开心
Thank you for tonight, oliver. It was a lovely party.

516
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,200
对不起 我让你难堪了
I'm so sorry that I put you through that.

517
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,500
听着 我不在乎这座城市的其他人怎么看我
Oh, listen, I don't care what anyone else in this city thinks of me.

518
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,330
我只在乎你俩对我的看法
I only care what you two think.

519
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,460
我要回办公室了 失陪
And I have to get back to the office. Excuse me.

520
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,730
对了 Thea
Thea.

521
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,160
我有件事想告诉你
There's something I need to tell you.

522
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,730
好啊 什么事?
Sure. What is it?

523
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,730
我爱你
I love you.

524
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,260
我也爱你
I love you, too.

525
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,760
是的
Yes.

526
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,000
是的 长官 我...
Yes, sir. I...

527
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,830
是的 主管 我知道这不是第一次了
Yes, Director, I know that this is not the first time.

528
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:14,660
是的 长官 我真的很重视我的工作 非常重视
Yes, sir, I do value my job, very much.

529
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,200
我会搭下一班火车回去
Look, I will be on the next train.

530
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,700
嗯 我今晚就回去 好的
Mmhmm. I'll be back tonight. Ok.

531
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,560
谢...
Thank...

532
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:28,330
我上司知道我没有食物中毒
Well, my boss found out I don't have food poisoning.

533
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,830
如果想保住工作的话 
I need to get back to central city

534
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,860
我要马上回中心城了
If I still want to be employed.

535
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,100
我不想失业
Which I do.

536
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,360
告诉Starling市警察局 小偷血中的镇静剂
Tell the SCPD that the sedative in the thief's blood

537
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,230
是克他命 是管制药物中的第三类
is ketamine. It's a schedule three controlled substance.

538
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,630
应该不难找到
It shouldn't be too hard to track.

539
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,160
好的 我会确认他们找得到
Yeah, I'll make sure they get it.

540
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,030
- 谢谢  - 和你共事...

542
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,360
没有你 任何事情...
Everything, we couldn't have done it...

543
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,230
都完成不了
without you.

544
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,230
再见 Felicity
Good bye, Felicity.

545
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,830

Good bye.

546
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,100
Max啊!
Max!

547
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,730
- 放开 放手!  - Max! 放开我! 
- Get off, let go!  - Max! Get off of me!   

548
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,730
喂! 放开她
Hey! Let her go.

549
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,160
住手!
Cut it out!

550
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,700
笨蛋警察
Stupid cops.

551
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,800
他们说Max过量吸毒了
They're saying Max oded.

552
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,100
- 他有吸毒吗?  - 没有!
- Was he using?  - No!

553
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,530
他靠献血赚钱
He made extra cash donating blood.

554
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,800
如果他过量吸毒 你觉得医院
You really think the hospital would let him

555
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,000
会让他献血吗?
be a donor if he was an addict?

556
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,400
喂 别待在这 小子
Hey. Can't be here, kid.

557
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,830
走吧
Let's go.

558
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,700
他们发现小偷的血液中有微量克他命
They found trace amounts of ketamine in the thief's blood.

559
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,060
这是一种用盐酸盐做的普通外科麻醉剂
It's a common surgical anesthesia derived from hydrochloric salt.

560
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,700
你可以用这找到他吗?
Can you use that to track him?

561
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,560
根据目前血液取样中的浓度比例
With the current concentration ratio in the blood sample,

562
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,260
只有一个地方可能有足够浓度的镇静剂
there's only one possible location with a large enough quality of the sedative

563
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,730
与血液量一一对应
that correlates with the amount of blood

564
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,030
偷来的离心机可以处理
The stolen centrifuge can process.

565
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,430
那是什么? 没有标志
What is it? There's no sign.

566
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,860
阿格斯可不爱打广告
ARGUS doesn't like to advertise.

567
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,860
那是个避难所 在棕榈湖的边上
It's a disaster bunker. Right on the edge of the glades.

568
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,460
阿格斯在全国各地都设了这些仓库
ARGUS has them all over the country.

569
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,760
他们储备救援物资...
They store relief supplies...

570
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,930
食物 衣服... 药品
Food, clothing... medicine.

571
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,530
我这就去
I'm on my way.

572
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,060
Oliver啊...
Oliver...

573
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,800
我说的话连我自己都不信
I can't believe I'm actually saying this.

574
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,930
根据剪头的弯曲程度...
The way this arrowhead is bent...

575
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,600
意味着这个贼的肌肉密度
It means our thief's muscle density

576
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,500
至少达到了每立方英尺120磅的密度
is at least 120 pounds per cubic foot.

577
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,260
等同于普通混凝土的密度
That's almost the same density as common concrete.

578
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,660
你的箭也许能割伤他 但阻止不了他
Your arrows may cut this guy, but they will not stop him.

579
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,930
Felicity 我之前打败过这种人
Well, I've beat someone like this before, Felicity.

580
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,960
我可以再赢一次
I can do it again.

581
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,500
如果你不能呢?
What if you can't?

582
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,600
Oliver啊
Oliver.

583
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,930
现在这个针剂可以救你...
Now this, it could save you...

584
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,060
也有可能杀了你
or it could kill you.

585
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,760
看你的表情
By the looks on your faces,

586
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,600
横竖都是死
I'm going to die anyway.

587
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,900
抱歉
Sorry.

588
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,700
抱歉什么?
For what?

589
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,960
抱歉我说不出我有多难过
For not telling you how I really feel.

590
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,060
打吧
Do it.

591
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,130
不!
No!

592
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,000
什么?
What?

593
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,500
我需要你帮我
I need your help.

594
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,360
我朋友的一个朋友
A friend of mine's friend, well,

595
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,430
警察判断他吸毒过量致死 但我们觉得
the cops think he oded, but we think

596
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,630
- 是谋杀  - 怎么说?
 
592
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,000
Well, he wasn't an addict, for starters. And this...
首先他之前不是瘾君子 还有...
- He was murdered.  - Why?

597
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,760
这种死状和我见过的吸毒过量的死状不同
This doesn't look like any od I've ever seen.

598
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,400
你别管了
Stay away from that.

599
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,100
你知道什么?
You know something?

600
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,100
他到底发生了什么?
What happened to him?

601
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,660
是你让我在这个城市做你的眼线
You're the one who told me to be your eyes and ears on the streets.

602
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,930
你知道吗 这样还不够
You know what, that is not good enough for me anymore.

603
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,960
行 那咱们就掰了吧
Fine. Then we're done altogether.

604
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,860
我不跟你了!
I don't need you!

605
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,060
我朋友他们会帮我的
I have friends that can help me.

606
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,530
你阻止不了我们的
You can't stop us.

607
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,860
自找的
Slow you down.

608
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,560
我以为增加保安就没什么事了
And I thought it couldn't hurt to add extra security guards.

609
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,430
对他们有事
It hurt them.

610
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,700
真糟糕
Badly.

611
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,900
你把Thea保护起来了?
Have you prepared Thea?

612
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,030
没有
No.

613
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,430
你根本就靠近不了Thea 也没有机会跟她说话
You will not go near Thea, you will not speak to her

614
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,900
你再也踏进不了这栋房子了
and you will never set foot in this house again.

615
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,560
Moira 我放过你
I set you free, Moira.

616
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,460
你的命在我手里
Your life belongs to me.

617
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,260
我一直害怕你
I am through being afraid of you.

618
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,230
你觉得你能阻止我?
You think you can stop me?

619
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,300
那绿箭侠都杀不了我
Even the vigilante couldn't kill me.

620
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,930
是 他杀不了
No, he couldn't.

621
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,030
但我知道谁能
But I know someone who can.

622
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:51,030
雷霄古可以
Ra's Al Ghul.

623
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,330
你怎么知道这个名字?
How do you know that name?

624
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,230
我以前不知道
Well, I didn't.

625
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:59,100
不过你提到南峰我就知道了
Until you mentioned Nanda Parbat.

626
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,900
影武者联盟 不管他们的目标多变态
The league of assassins, however twisted their aims,

627
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,660
其成员都必然听从联盟的命令
believes very deeply in a code of honor.

628
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,360
你正在背叛联盟的命令
Your undertaking betrayed that code.

629
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,800
你告诉雷霄古我还活着?
You told Ra's I'm still alive?

630
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,230
他很高兴听到你没死
He was so grateful to hear it.

631
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:19,630
他特别希望亲手杀了你
Because he so very much wants to kill you himself.

632
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,500
Malcolm 我建议你...
So my advice to you, Malcolm...

633
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,330
跑路吧
Run.

634
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,960
Moira 咱们没完
This isn't finished, Moira.

635
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,360
你是谁?
Who are you?

636
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,800
跑龙套的
Merely a follower.

637
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,560
- 谁的手下?!  - 我兄弟
- Of who?!  - My brother.

638
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,200
他给你吃特效药了?
Did he give you the mirakuru?

639
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,530
他给你打了那种药吗?!
Did he inject you with it?!

640
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,730
没有 他用那药救了我
No. He saved me with it.

641
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,260
不
No.

642
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,600
醒醒
Please.

643
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,560
醒醒!
Please!

644
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,800
醒醒
Please.

645
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,130
- Oliver啊!  - Oliver啊!
- Oliver!  - Oliver!

646
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,560
- Oliver啊!  - Oliver啊!
- Oliver!  - Oliver!

647
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,560
他还活着吗?
Is he alive?

648
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,030
他脉搏很弱 但还有气 Oliver啊!
His pulse is weak, but it's there. Oliver!

649
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,300
听得见我说话吗?
Can you hear me?

650
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,030
他瞳孔张开了!
His pupils are dilated!

651
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,860
这是什么?
What the hell was that?

652
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,960
我不知道 加密了
I don't know, it's coded.

653
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,160
该死 该死!
Damn it. Damn it!

654
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,530
我进不了医疗站的程序
I can't break into the dispensary files.

655
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,130
我不知道他被打了什么药!
I have no idea what he was injected with!

656
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,000
什么毒
Poisoned with.

657
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,830
- 好吧 我们别无选择了  - 你干嘛?
- All right, we have no choice.  - What are you doing?

658
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,360
快叫救护车

659
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,500
- Dig 等等!  - 不能再等了!
- Dig, wait!  - Can't wait!

660
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,660
我们怎么解释这一切?
How are we supposed to explain this?

661
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,130
所有人都会发现Oliver是绿箭侠!
Everyone's going to find out Oliver's the vigilante!

662
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:22,560
如果他死了就什么都没意义了
Which won't matter if he's dead.

663
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,460
Felicity 我们救不了他!
Felicity, we can't save him!

664
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,860
我懂 你说的对...
I know, you're right...

665
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,830
我们不能
We can't.

666
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,560
去中心城的单程票

668
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,760
果然还是晚了
Of course it did.

669
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,230
下一班什么时候?
When is the next one?

670
