1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,466
你有没看上这里的谁？
You got your eye on anyone?

2
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:11,094
嗯，还没
Em, not really.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,805
其实刚才我在跟老鼠说话
Actually, I was talking to the mouse.

4
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:17,559
既然提到这一点
这里有几个女人长得还真是火辣
But now you mention it,
some of those women are pretty hot,

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,896
我们刚把她们从幽灵那里救出来
在他们还没发现我们不是很酷之前
我们得好好利用这一点
and we did just save them from the Wraith,
and we gotta trade on that while we can,
before they discover that we're not that cool.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,982
坐下  我准备好
Sit down, I'm ready.

7
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,406
现在你仍然十分热情地当志愿者
令我感到惊奇
I'm surprised you're still eager to volunteer for this Rodney.

8
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,825
你也是知道的
我一向乐于助人
Well you know me. Always eager to help.

9
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:39,914
好的  你对这个过程有什么疑问的？
怎么说你也是个科学家
Right. So do you have any questions about the process?
I mean you are a scientist.

10
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:45,503
呃  恕我冒昧  医学不单是门科学
而且也有些巫术的成分？
Uh, yeah. I'm sorry, medicine is about as much of a science as,
I don't know, voodoo?

11
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:51,593
我感兴趣的是  这样我就可以像Sheppard少校和你一样
使用古代的科学技术了
All I need to know is that, that will enable me to use Ancient technology,
like Major Sheppard or yourself.

12
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,013
也许吧  你是第一个临床实验者
Yes, hopefully. You are the first human trial.

13
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,598
那为什么不现在？
Well why now?

14
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,642
我是说  如果可能的话  我们需要
尽可能多的人类基因
I mean, if it's possible,
we need as many people with the gene, as we could get.

15
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,688
事实上  没有食品药物管理署的批准
我们不可能在地球上……
Well actually, without proper FDA approval,
virtually impossible on Earth to...

16
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,193
这么说吧  在这飞马星系
这么做是合法的
Let's just say, it's legal here, in the Pegasus Galaxy.

17
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,527
并且十分安全的
And completely safe.

18
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:15,867
我只是在目前基因治疗技术的水平下
对你的DNA进行操作  开始吧
As far as experimental gene therapy goes.
I am manipulating your DNA. Here we go.

19
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,285
等等  也许你该解释得清楚些
Maybe you should tell me more.

20
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:23,792
我们认为ATA  也就是古代科技激活
是由一个始终在起作用的基因造成的
We believe ATA, or Ancient Technology Activation,
is caused by a single gene that's always on.

21
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:28,004
它指导身体各个部位的细胞
产生一系列的蛋白质和酶
Instructing various cells of the body
to produce a series of proteins and enzymes,

22
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:32,008
并与皮肤  神经系统  大脑
互相影响
that interact with the skin,
the nervous system, and the brain.

23
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,595
我将通过注射鼠类逆转录病毒
为你的细胞添加遗失的基因
In this case we're using a mouse retro virus
to deliver the missing gene to your cells.

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,888
鼠类逆转录病毒？
A mouse retro virus

25
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,181
已经被抑制了的
It's been de-activated.

26
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,141
有什么副作用吗？
Well are there any side effects?

27
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:45,105
嘴唇干燥  头疼
不可抑止的向轮子冲过去的冲动
Dry mouth, headache,
the irresistable urge to run on a small wheel.

28
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,400
还真有趣  什么时候会生效？
Oh that's very amusing. So how long till it starts working?

29
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,193
需要一些时间  那是什么
It could take some time. What is that?

30
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:56,157
这是我在一个实验室里找到的
是一个古代人用来做实验的东西
It's something I found in one of the research labs.
Something the Ancients were experimenting with.

31
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,909
你知道这是什么吗？
Do you know what it is?

32
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,204
当然
Pretty sure.

33
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:05,542
我们可以将海水淡化  存在大的储水槽里
城市的供水就能解决了
Desalinizing the sea water and storing it in
tanks big enough to supply the whole city.

34
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,711
好啊  那淡水问题就不存在了
Good. So fresh water, won't be a problem.

35
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,880
现在看来有些古代科技需要使用者
携带那些基因
It seems some Ancient technology requires
the user to have the gene.

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,718
其他的只需要初始化一下
一旦被激活  就像控制室一样
Other things merely require initialisation.
Once activated, like the control room.

37
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,636
任何人都可以通过按钮使它工作
Anyone can push the buttons to make them work.

38
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,013
早晨好  Weir博士
Good morning Doctor Weir.

39
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:23,268
早晨好  小心点！
我觉得我们需要划出专门的休闲区域了
Morning. Careful!
I think we need to designate some recreational areas.

40
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,227
是啊
Yes.

41
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,981
我们必须把走廊清理一下
尽快把东西都放好
We certainly need to clear the hallway
and have everything put away as soon as possible.

42
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,693
那些万年古植物会有位置吗？
And can we lose the ten thousand year old dead plants?

43
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,488
当然  我们仍然在给大家分配居住区
Of course. We're still in the process of making
sure everyone's been assigned living quarters.

44
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,700
Sheppard少校正花时间来腾出空间来
Major Sheppard seems to be taking his time locating enough space.

45
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,577
这次探险的安全问题…………
Well the safety and security of this expedition...

46
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:41,911
好了  我准备好了
Ok, I'm ready!

47
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,373
我的天啊
Oh my God!

48
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,542
你看见了吗？
Did you see that?

49
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,501
看见了  你们……
Yes! what that...

50
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,794
我没事
I'm fine.

51
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,302
看  Becketts的基因治疗成功了
Look, Becketts gene therapy worked!

52
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,181
我可以激活它
这简直就是个金钟罩
I was able to activate this.
It's a personal shield, that acts like a protective skin.

53
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,226
而且这有减少惯性的能力
因为我一点感觉也没有  看着
They must have inertia dampening properties too
because I didn't feel a thing. Watch this.

54
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,811
打我
Hit me.

55
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,229
嗷！天啊！
Ow! God!

56
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,610
你没必要出这么重的拳
我注意到他一点也没犹豫
You didn't have to swing so hard.
And I notice that he didn't even hesitate.

57
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:19,157
我仍然不能理解  你为什么要让人把你
从阳台上扔下来作为测试
I'm still trying to understand,
how you thought it was a good idea to test this device,
by having someone throw you off a balcony.

58
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,493
信不信由你
刚才那个不是第一次了
Oh believe me.
That's not the first time we tried it.

59
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,828
我对他开枪…………
I shot him.....

60
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,081
是腿！
In the leg!

61
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,708
我刀枪不入了
I'm invulnerable.

62
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:34,381
你以前不是一直鼓吹科学实验要
恰当而安全的一步步进行么？
Aren't you the one who's always spouting off about
how proper and careful scientific procedure must be adhered to?

63
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,799
刀枪不入
Invulnerable.

64
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,843
好吧  不说这个了
我们去开会吧
Alright, take it off. Let's go have this meeting.

65
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:39,844
她是在嫉妒我
She's jealous.

66
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,513
是啊  脸都绿了
Oh yes, green with envy.

67
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:49,020
有问题  我自己都进不去
This could be a problem. I can't get at it.

68
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,531
只是试一试
Just checking.

69
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:59,247
第三集：捉迷藏
Episode 3 : HIDE AND SEEK

70
00:05:08,832 --> 00:05:10,709
常胜将军怎么样
I'm thinking Mr Invincible.

71
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,377
不可触摸的船长
Captain Untouchable.

72
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:14,004
哇  这不错
Ooh, that's good.

73
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:15,505
你们好了吗？
You guys done?

74
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:22,220
我已经为这个基因治疗忙了好几个月了
请原谅我现在有些激动  因为第一个临床实验成功了
I've been working on this gene therapy for months,
forgive me for wanting to celebrate the fact that it worked,
on the first human trial.

75
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,430
那我们开始狂欢吧
Oh, let's all have a toast.

76
00:05:28,184 --> 00:05:32,022
随便说说  你在做完手术后
有没吃过东西？
Just a thought here, but have you tried eating
or drinking anything since you put that on?

77
00:05:50,498 --> 00:05:51,541
太好了
That's great.

78
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:55,879
这比我猜想的还要严重
This may be more serious than I suspected.

79
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:58,006
哦  谢谢  我现在饿了
我该怎么办？
Oh thankyou. I'm hungry already. What am I going to do?

80
00:05:58,006 --> 00:06:00,050
如果我不把这东西取下来
今天我就会饿死
If I don't get this stupid thing off, I'll be dead by the end of the day.

81
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,427
放松  人没有水可以活3，4天
Relax. You can live three or four days without water.

82
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,595
我是说吃的
I'm talking about food.

83
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:06,598
你读过一些关于这个设备的文献
上面说应该怎么把它取下来？
You found some Ancient text with the device.
What did it say about taking it off?

84
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:09,601
没错  是有详细的说明
但我全都跳过了
Oh yeah, there were some explicit instructions,
which I chose to completely ignore.

85
00:06:09,684 --> 00:06:12,729
一些古代科技可使用
心理方面的东西进行控制
Well, some Ancient technology uses
a mental component for operation.

86
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:14,230
闭嘴  我在想东西
Just shut up, I'm thinking.

87
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,322
有没可能基因治疗的效果不是永久的？
Is there any chance that
the gene therapy isn't permanent?

88
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:24,699
可能
It's possible.

89
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:26,451
我死定了
Oh, I'm a dead man.

90
00:06:26,993 --> 00:06:30,997
以现有的人力资源
我们应该可以保持这一地区的安全
We can probably maintain security in this area,
with the limited number of personnel we have.

91
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:32,749
我们可以帮忙
My people can help.

92
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:37,087
谢谢  Teyla  这一次我们会
考虑Ethosian人其他可以帮忙的方式
Thankyou Teyla. For the time being
we'll find other way's that the Ethosians can contribute.

93
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:38,838
你们不相信我们？
You do not trust us?

94
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,135
不是这样的  是因为我们需要时间
来训练你们  以熟悉我们的武器和战术
It's not that, it's just that we, we need to train
your people in our weapons and tactics.

95
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:46,221
是你请我加入你们这个团队的
You invited me to be a member of your team.

96
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:48,723
我们也尊重你们的知识和专长
And we value your knowledge and expertise.

97
00:06:48,932 --> 00:06:51,017
就像我们尊重所有Ethosian人一样
As we value all the Ethosians.

98
00:06:51,184 --> 00:06:55,397
现在看来  规划好的区域足够
给每个人分配生活的空间
For now, there should be more than enough living space for everyone,
within the designated area.

99
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,982
我们总是生活在幽灵的阴影之下
We have always lived in the shadow of the Wraith

100
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:00,735
但我们还从没在这样的地方呆过
But my people have never been in a place such as this.

101
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:06,282
他们有些恐慌  甚至怀疑
这里有鬼魂的存在
They are afraid. Some believe that
the ghosts of the ancestors remain.

102
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:11,663
我认为这不是问题  我们还需要一些时间
来了解整个城市的情况
I don't think that's the case, but still we're gonna need
a bit more time in order to explore the entire city.

103
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:15,250
我们是小心翼翼的星际宇航员
We're very cautious, intergalactic, explorers.

104
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,004
我们不希望再有人像Hollan那样
受到伤害
And we don't want anyone else getting hurt,
the way Hollan did.

105
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:24,300
每个人都必须知道如果不是确定的话
就不要动陌生的东西
I mean everyone needs to understand they're not to touch
anything unfamiliar, unless it's been cleared first.

106
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:29,806
这一点很重要
你不知道  就算是平淡无味的东西都可能致命
It's very important.
You never know, even a tiny little innocuous thing, can kill you.

107
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:33,435
就当死人说话好了
Dead man talking.

108
00:07:37,814 --> 00:07:38,648
Carson
Carson.

109
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:40,734
Weir博士
Doctor Weir.

110
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:45,739
Groden已经带了一支队伍检查了
古代研究资料里有关那个保护层的内容
So Groden's got a team, going through the Ancients research
material that accompanied the shield device.

111
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:50,702
McKay已经都读过那些了  他没有发现有用的东西
他可是这儿最聪明的人了
But McKay's been through it, and he didn't find anything helpful.
And he is the smartest guy here.

112
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:59,711
他总是这么说自己  听着
我感觉糟透了  这可能是人工把基因强行加入的恶果
So he likes to tell us. Listen, I feel terrible.
It's possible this is the result of artificially imposing the gene.

113
00:07:59,794 --> 00:08:05,925
我有另一个想法  我们知道
有一个心理的方法可以使用古代科技
Well I have another theory.
We know that there is a mental component,
to using Ancient technology.

114
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:10,722
不需要你来提醒我  这是我亲自经历的
连同那个嗡嗡作响的武器一起回到地球的
You don't have to remind me.
I experienced it first hand, with that drone weapon, back on Earth.

115
00:08:10,805 --> 00:08:16,019
是啊  你不认为McKay有可能
可以用他的意念来去除那个东西？
Exactly. So don't you think it stands to reason
that McKay should be able to shut this thing off with his mind?

116
00:08:16,644 --> 00:08:18,813
你是说他并不想去掉那个东西？
Are you suggesting he doesn't want to shut it off?

117
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,817
我们也许可以在这里定居下来
但这个地方  还是缺乏安全感
We may be settling in here, but this place,
it's still pretty intimidating.

118
00:08:22,817 --> 00:08:29,949
一个巨大的被废弃的城市  充满了我们无法理解的东西
还感受着幽灵无处不在的威胁
A giant abandoned city,
full of things way beyond our level of understanding.
Impending threat of attack from the Wraith.

119
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:32,827
不对  这里一到夜里就十分恐怖
No question, it gets bloody creepy here at night.

120
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:37,165
我并不是说这是有意的
也许是无意的
So I'm not saying it's conscious,
but perhaps subconsciously.

121
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:40,293
我想他并不想脱水而死
I don't think he wants to die of dehydration.

122
00:08:40,293 --> 00:08:43,171
我也不想啊  但他还没到那种程度
No, neither do I. But he's not there yet.

123
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:47,884
难道你认为到了那一步的时候
那个东西会自己关闭吗？
You think when it comes down to it,
the shield will just shut itself down?

124
00:08:48,468 --> 00:08:52,013
古代人已经足够聪明了
他们一定做了事故保障装置
The Ancients were smart enough to put failsafe's into their other technology.

125
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:56,518
当危难迫近时  这整个城市从深海中浮了起来
This entire city rose from the deep of the ocean,
when danger was imminent.

126
00:08:57,018 --> 00:08:59,979
他们为什么要设计一个
可以置人于死地的防护层呢？
Why would they design a personal shield
that could kill you?

127
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:03,775
我也宁愿相信你是对的
看在Rodney的份上
I certainly hope you're right. For Rodney's sake.

128
00:09:08,905 --> 00:09:11,616
自毁系统需要两套密码
The self destruct system requires two separate codes.

129
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:15,161
两套密码是独一无二的
这里的每一个人都必须记住自己的密码
Now each code is unique,
and everyone here will be required to memorise their code.

130
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:17,747
不用给我了  对不起
Well don't bother giving me one. Sorry.

131
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:23,503
从目前掌握的情况看  这是飞马星座上唯一
可以与地球通信的星际门
As far as we know, this is the only Stargate in the Pegasus galaxy,
which is capable of dialling Earth.

132
00:09:23,503 --> 00:09:26,006
这使它成为抵御幽灵的最后一道防线
Which would make it the last line of defence
against the Wraith.

133
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:32,303
如果他们开始攻击  这对我们来说是个巨大的威胁
我们坚决不能让他们控制这套房子
If they're gonna attack, which we must consider a very real threat.
We simply cannot let them gain control of this complex.

134
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:36,975
如果两套密码都被正确输入的话
发生器将会超载  这个过程有30秒
If both codes are properly entered,
the naquadah generator will overload. It will take 30 seconds.

135
00:09:37,058 --> 00:09:38,685
你确定威力够大吗？
You're sure it'll do enough damage?

136
00:09:38,727 --> 00:09:40,812
见过20千吨当量的核爆炸吗？
Ever see a 20 kiloton nuclear explosion?

137
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:48,945
我……其实没有那么大
我想我们该告诉Teyla我们现在的进度
I have....Not up close.
Look, I think we should tell Teyla what's going on here.

138
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:53,033
直到现在  我们都还不知道是不是其中一个
Ethosian人泄露了你去那个星球的消息
At this moment, we still don't know if it was one of the Ethosians,
who tipped off your arrival to their planet.

139
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,659
我相信Teyla
I trust Teyla.

140
00:09:54,993 --> 00:10:02,250
我也是  但是Teyla相信她的人民
如果我们告诉她  她会告诉她的人民
我觉得我们还需要时间去加深对他们的了解
So do I, but Teyla trusts her people. If we tell her,
she'll wanna tell them, and I need more time to get to know them.

141
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:16,056
他们以为他死了
但就在他们转身要走的刹那
Well, they thought he was finally dead.
But when they turned their backs to go....

142
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:20,477
冰球面具下那双冰冷的眼睛睁开了
他提着血淋淋的刀站了起来！
His cold dead eyes opened beneath his hockey mask, and he rose up with his giant bloody knife!

143
00:10:20,602 --> 00:10:22,187
冰球面具是什么？
What's a hockey mask?

144
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:30,487
冰球是一种比赛
运动员们在冰上滑动  努力把球送到网里
Hockey's a game.
Guys skate around the ice and try to put a puck into the net?

145
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:36,993
守门员要戴面具  它很…………
The goalie's wear masks, it's really....

146
00:10:40,497 --> 00:10:42,165
……吓人
....scary

147
00:10:42,832 --> 00:10:44,334
再说点冰球的东西
Tell us more of this game.

148
00:10:44,334 --> 00:10:45,752
我们可以玩吗？
Can we play it?

149
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:53,385
事实上  我不觉得冰球有趣
橄榄球  橄榄球才是男人的运动
我们下次再说橄榄球
Actually, I don't really see the attraction.
Now football, football's a real mans sport,
but we'll save that for another time.

150
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:55,095
好了  睡觉时间到了
Yes, it's time for bed

151
00:10:56,721 --> 00:11:03,061
记住  孩子们  明晚
我给你们讲榆木大街的恶梦
And remember, tomorrow night kids,
another tale called, Nightmare On Elm Street.

152
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:06,106
好了  孩子们  我们走吧
Alright children. Let's go.

153
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:11,820
谢谢少校
Thankyou Major

154
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:14,864
希望我没有吓到他们
I hope I didn't scare them too much.

155
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:17,367
我想不会的
I don't think so.

156
00:11:17,992 --> 00:11:19,160
好
Good.

157
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:29,212
听着  Teyla
Ah listen, Teyla.

158
00:11:29,796 --> 00:11:34,509
不要跟McKay说我认为冰球
不是男人的运动
Don't tell McKay what I said about
the hockey not being a real man's sport.

159
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:37,929
因为……他是加拿大人
他们对这件事比较敏感
Because... it's a Canadian thing, they're a little touchy about it.

160
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:42,559
我对你即将说的橄榄球更感兴趣
你说你非常喜欢这项运动
I'm interested more in hearing about his football,
you say you love so much.

161
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:45,520
我可以做的更好  跟我来
I can do one better. Come here.

162
00:11:49,816 --> 00:11:54,320
爸爸  你说我们在这里能躲过幽灵吗？
Father? Do you think we are safe here,
from the Wraith?

163
00:11:57,991 --> 00:12:03,330
我觉得生命中充满了不确定的东西
除了我对你的爱
I think there's nothing certain in life,
except my love for you.

164
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:10,086
你想念有风的日子么？
Do you miss the wind?

165
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:14,507
是啊  如果你非常安静的话
你可以听到海洋的声音
Yes. But if you're very quiet, you can hear the ocean.

166
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:19,929
你说那些鬼魂还住在这儿吗？
Do you think the ghosts of the ancestors still live here?

167
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:22,849
Jinto！睡觉！
Jinto! Go to sleep.

168
00:12:29,814 --> 00:12:30,815
有趣
Funny.

169
00:12:31,524 --> 00:12:33,068
来了  快看
Oh here it comes, watch this.

170
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:47,207
噢  真漂亮  难以置信
Oh! That is beautiful. Can you believe that?

171
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,833
我该不相信吗？
Should I not?

172
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:54,089
防守球员没有照顾好接球队员
因为他认为边锋不可能把球扔的这么远
Well the defence didn't cover the receiver,
cos he didn't think the quarterback could throw that far.

173
00:12:54,172 --> 00:12:56,341
他们看起来很兴奋
They seem very happy.

174
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:59,636
他们刚刚排除万难  拿下了一场艰苦的比赛
Well we just won one
of the best games of all time, against all odds.

175
00:13:00,053 --> 00:13:01,221
那年是Flooty赢了吧
Flooty won that year.

176
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:02,764
然后他们转战加拿大
And then went to play in Canada.

177
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:04,099
他也玩冰球吗？
He played hockey too?

178
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:07,769
嘿   你们在这儿做什么？
Hey, what are you guys doing?

179
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:12,315
告诉Teyla橄榄球是西方文明的基石
Teaching Teyla how football
is the cornerstone of Western civilization.

180
00:13:12,732 --> 00:13:14,192
没叫上我？
And you didn't invite me?

181
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:15,235
你也喜欢？
You like football?

182
00:13:15,568 --> 00:13:16,945
不  不喜欢
No, not really.

183
00:13:17,153 --> 00:13:22,367
考虑一下吧  它很真实   不可预测
而且充满了激情和啤酒
Of course, it's real, it's unpredictable.
It's full of passion and beer.

184
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,452
拉拉队长
Cheerleaders.

185
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:27,872
我不明白你选择你的个人物品
你偏偏选择了这个
I just don't get that you got one personal item,
and you chose this.

186
00:13:28,957 --> 00:13:35,630
这是个象征  你不觉得吗？
整个探险的过程是人类历史上最大的万福玛丽亚
It's a metaphor. Don't you see?
This entire expedition, is the biggest hail mary in human history.

187
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:38,133
什么是万福玛丽亚？
What is a hail mary?

188
00:13:38,258 --> 00:13:42,512
这是你刚看过的戏的名字
用一个祷告命名的
It's a play that you just saw.
It's named after a prayer.

189
00:13:42,595 --> 00:13:49,227
有个女的  她叫玛丽亚  她……
我说过我很喜欢弗累斯大转轮吗？
See this woman and her name was Mary, and she uh....
Did I mention how much I like ferris wheels?

190
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:08,413
你不想演幽灵了吗
Aren't you going to be the Wraith?

191
00:14:08,538 --> 00:14:12,000
你可以演的  我演Sheppard少校
You can be the Wraith. I get to be Major Sheppard.

192
00:14:18,882 --> 00:14:26,306
1,2,3,4,5,6……
One, two, three,four,five, six...

193
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:41,112
Wex？
Wex?

194
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:12,435
Jinto？
Jinto?

195
00:15:25,865 --> 00:15:33,790
少校？少校！Jinto不见了
我到处找不到他
Major? Major! Jinto's missing. I can't find him.

196
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:37,752
我告诉他小心的
他碰的每一件东西都很危险
I told him to be careful,
that anything he touches can be dangerous.

197
00:15:38,294 --> 00:15:40,046
如果这里有怪物怎么办？
What if there are monsters here?

198
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:41,381
我们会找到他的
We'll find him

199
00:15:44,968 --> 00:15:50,390
Jinto不见了  2队听命
开始逐层搜索  从Jumpers开始  全速开动
Jinto's missing. Teams of two.
Floor to floor sweep now, starting with the Jumpers. Full gear.

200
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,599
遵命 长官
Yes sir!

201
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:54,436
他不在任何一个生活区里
He's not in any of the other living quarters.

202
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:55,520
我跟你一起去
I'm coming with you.

203
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:57,689
你的腿还行吗？
Are you gonna be ok with that leg?

204
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,191
他是我儿子
He's my son.

205
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:09,784
我们可以用感应器找到他的方位吗？
Can we use the sensors to locate him?

206
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:12,746
我们没有这么多的能量可以
来一次激活整个城市
We don't have nearly enough power
to activate the whole city at one time.

207
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:14,914
就算可以  感应器也没法分辨出……
Even if we could, the sensors don't distinguish...

208
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,084
人
Individuals

209
00:16:18,168 --> 00:16:21,504
我们只知道  也许有些区域被屏蔽了
或者有的感应器无法正常工作
For all we know, there could be shielded areas,
or malfunctioning sensors.

210
00:16:21,504 --> 00:16:25,467
在一个未爆炸的区域我们感应到
一股奇异的能量穿过城市
We are getting a pretty strange energy reading
in one of the unexplored areas, across the city.

211
00:16:25,592 --> 00:16:27,385
把通讯系统激活
Activate the communication system.

212
00:16:28,595 --> 00:16:29,554
好了
Done.

213
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:36,519
Jinto？我是Weir博士
如果你能听到我  请回复
Jinto? This is Doctor Weir.
If you can hear me, please respond.

214
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:44,569
Jinto？如果你丢了  如果你不能…………
Jinto? If you're lost, if you can't...

215
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,864
我们已经用尽能量了
We've lost power.

216
00:16:47,864 --> 00:16:49,407
我们还有灯
We've still got lights.

217
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:55,622
我不知道为什么会这样
I don't know why that happened.

218
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:03,004
不是我干的
That wasn't me!

219
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:15,517
把它关了
Shut it down now!

220
00:17:19,688 --> 00:17:21,815
- 这到底是怎么了
- 我不知道
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

221
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:24,484
- 这种情况从未发生过
- 我们到这儿才几天
- Nothing like this has happened before.
- We've only been here for a couple of days.

222
00:17:26,486 --> 00:17:30,990
这些设备都很老了
或许真的有鬼魂
This stuff is pretty old. It's that, or there really are ghosts.

223
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,172
控制室吗 我是Sheppard  灯突然熄灭了
Control room, this is Sheppard. The lights just went out.

224
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:49,509
少校  我们碰到一些机械故障
Major, we're experiencing some technical malfunctions

225
00:17:58,018 --> 00:18:01,021
我想应该跟发生器和城市之间的接口有关
I think it's something to do with the interfaces
between our naquada generators and the city.

226
00:18:01,104 --> 00:18:05,191
我们隔离某些系统的方法可能会
导致古代程序的错误操作
That, or the way we isolated certain systems,
could be causing erroneous operations in the Ancient programming.

227
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:07,152
我来诊断一下功率通量
I'll run a diagnostic on the power flow.

228
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:10,155
我没想到你还信鬼神
I wouldn't have thought you believed in ghosts.

229
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:15,493
以前可不是的  自从我见到幽灵以后
他们可以用手把灵魂吸出来  那到底是怎么回事
I never used to. Then I learned about things called Wraiths,
that can suck the life out of you with their hands. What the hell is that?

230
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:17,454
Weir博士？
Dr Weir?

231
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,916
Teyla  我会尽快赶到  你先控制局面
Teyla, I'll be right there. Do what you can.

232
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:23,209
好的
Right.

233
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:30,008
Weir博士 我是Marta
Dr Weir, this is Marta.

234
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,552
很高兴见到你
Pleased to meet you.

235
00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:36,264
没事的  告诉她你看到什么
It's alright. Tell her what you saw.

236
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:39,267
一个阴影
A shadow.

237
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:43,980
那是幽灵搞的鬼
让你看到幻境
The Wraith project them.
Make you see things that aren't there.

238
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,983
你确定？
Are you sure?

239
00:18:49,235 --> 00:18:51,488
我还没感觉到幽灵
And yet I sense no Wraith here.

240
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:58,495
Teyla你是不是有感觉错误的时候
Sheppard少校  我是Weir
Teyla, have you ever been wrong about that?
Major Sheppard? This is Weir.

241
00:18:58,912 --> 00:19:02,999
有一个Ethosian人说她看到一个
阴影状的东西
One of the Ethosians is claiming to have seen,
what she's calling a shadow.

242
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:05,794
她不相信我？
She does not believe me?

243
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:12,676
Teyla说她没感觉到附近有幽灵
但我仍感到怀疑
Teyla say's that she senses no Wraith here,
but I'm still concerned.

244
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:16,096
好吧  我会后退到控制室
你们等下一个命令
Alright, I'll just fall back to the gateroom,
and wait for further instructions.

245
00:19:16,763 --> 00:19:18,139
我们不能停止搜索
We can't stop searching.

246
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,559
如果这里有危险的话
我们需要建立防御工事
If there is a threat here, we need to establish a proper perimeter.

247
00:19:35,323 --> 00:19:38,243
我已经确保了控制塔和生活区的进出安全
I've secured access to the control tower and the living quarters.

248
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:40,745
又有两个Ethosian人报告说看到阴影
Two more Ethosians reported seeing the shadows.

249
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,289
我弄不明白
如果真是这样的话  那意味着幽灵已经在这儿了
You know, I don't get that.
That means the Wraith would be here.

250
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,250
你不认为吗？
You don't think so?

251
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:51,089
我认为他们没必要吓唬我们
他们决定要来的话  直接开着飞船就来了
I don't think they wanna scare us. When they decide to come?
They're gonna start blowing the crap out of this place with their ships.

252
00:19:51,214 --> 00:19:53,174
那又如何？Ethosian人只是看到了一些东西？
So what? The Ethosians are just seeing things?

253
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:55,844
就算Teyla说的那样  他们在这里感到恐惧吧
Well, like Teyla said, it's a scary place for them.

254
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:57,053
不单对他们
Not just for them.

255
00:19:57,345 --> 00:19:59,139
Hollan想跟Jinto说话
Hollan wishes to speak with Jinto.

256
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:01,057
请
Please.

257
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,062
来吧
Go ahead.

258
00:20:07,856 --> 00:20:16,990
Jinto！如果你能听到我  我告诉你我不生气
我只是想知道你现在是安全的
Jinto! If you can hear me, I'm not angry.
I just want to know that you are safe.

259
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:29,252
如果你迷路或者受伤了  呆在原地别动
可能的话弄出点声音 我们会找到你的
So if you are lost, or hurt, stay where you are.
Make some noise if you can. We will find you.

260
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:41,639
他说的是拉丁语吗？
Is that Latin?

261
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:45,560
是古语  永恒圣殿的光之父？
It's Ancient. Fathers of the light, of the everlasting temple?

262
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:47,771
这个祭祖的祷告语
It is a prayer to the ancestors.

263
00:20:48,605 --> 00:20:55,153
如果你对我们不恰当的定居在这个城市感到生气的话
我们表示诚挚的道歉
If you are angry that we have unrightfully inhabited your great city,
we humbly apologise.

264
00:20:55,195 --> 00:21:04,496
我们没有恶意  如果这是你的旨意
我们会离开的  但没有儿子我是不会走的
We mean no harm. We will leave, if it is your wish.
But I will not go without my son.

265
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,057
- 他晕过去了
- 能用个好点的词吗
- He fainted.
- There's gotta be a better word.

266
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:25,642
“晕”是最恰当的医学用语
Faint, is the proper medical term.

267
00:21:25,725 --> 00:21:28,269
我由于饥饿昏倒了
I passed out from manly hunger.

268
00:21:28,978 --> 00:21:31,314
你在这等一下
Well, hang in there

269
00:21:31,314 --> 00:21:35,402
Weir博士？McKay没事了
他晕倒了
Dr Weir? McKay is ok. He fainted.

270
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:40,407
是的  很有同情心嘛
我们一起来嘲笑这个要死的人吧  谢谢
Oh yes. Very sympathetic.
Let's all mock the dying man. Thankyou.

271
00:23:08,825 --> 00:23:10,994
这不像是幽灵使你看到的那种幻象
It didn't look like the phantoms
the Wraith's make you see,

272
00:23:11,036 --> 00:23:13,747
现在我知道Ethosian人为什么感到迷惑了
but I can see how the Ethosians
would be confused.

273
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:16,124
- 它看起来什么样？
- 就像………………
- What did it look like?
- It looked like a....

274
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,626
黑暗
Darkness.

275
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:20,379
它环绕着发生器  然后开始膨胀
It surrounded the naquadah generator
and started to grow.

276
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,214
就像在吸取能量一样
Like it was feeding off the energy.

277
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:25,258
把发生器关了以后   整个
不管它是什么玩意儿了  它就不见了
When you shut it down, the whole,
whatever it was, it just went away.

278
00:23:28,011 --> 00:23:30,472
如果这东西吸取能量的话
我们的麻烦就大了
If this thing feeds on energy,
we could be in big trouble.

279
00:23:30,514 --> 00:23:34,142
我刚才说“我们”  其实我指的是“你们”
因为我撑不了那么久了
And when I say we, I mean you, because
I won't actually be around for much longer.

280
00:23:34,184 --> 00:23:37,646
我们必须弄清这到底是什么东西
是用来做什么的
So we need to figure out exactly
what it is and what to do about it.

281
00:23:37,688 --> 00:23:40,524
- 我知道它对能量感兴趣
- 关掉发生器怎么样？
- We know it's attracted to energy.
- How about shutting down the generators.

282
00:23:40,524 --> 00:23:42,859
人也会散发热量
Well people also give off heat energy.

283
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:45,445
显然这个发生器产生的热量
不是一个数量级的
Granted it's negligible compared to
that of a naquadah generator,

284
00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:48,448
但只有你吃过东西以后……
but you take away this things
only other obvious sort of food and....

285
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,616
你是说它会跟着我们吗？
Are you saying it could come after us?

286
00:23:49,658 --> 00:23:52,202
只有一件事我是肯定的
我们生活在飞翔的黑暗中
Well I only know one thing for sure,
and that is flying darkness

287
00:23:52,202 --> 00:23:54,121
这会极大极大的消耗能量
that eats energy,
can only be very, very bad.

288
00:23:54,162 --> 00:23:58,333
好吧  我们把电源开着
Groden  尽快找到侦测阴影的方法
Ok, we keep the power on.
Groden, figure out a way to detect it,

289
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:01,962
同时少校负责对所有的发生器进行监督
and Major, in the meantime, establish
a constant surveillance on all the generators.

290
00:24:02,004 --> 00:24:04,506
如果其中有一个被盯上来
我们就把它关了
If one of them is targeted,
we'll shut it down remotely.

291
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:06,591
这样或许可以使阴影疲于奔命
And hopefully we can keep this thing busy,

292
00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:08,927
我们就有时间找到摆脱它的办法
until we figure out a way to get rid of it.

293
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:10,387
所有人注意  我是Weir
Attention everyone, this is Weir!

294
00:24:10,387 --> 00:24:15,809
从现在开始  我要求你们停在原地
除非另有通知  如果你们看见……
For the time being, we need you all to remain in your quarters,
unless otherwise instructed. If you see anything out of the....

295
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:20,480
Hello！你能听到我说话吗？
有人能听到我说话吗？
<i>Hello! Can you hear me? Can anyone hear me?</i>

296
00:24:20,731 --> 00:24:21,523
Jinto？
Jinto?

297
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,649
Sheppard少校！
<i>Major Sheppard!</i>

298
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,234
你还好吗？
Are you ok?

299
00:24:24,693 --> 00:24:25,485
我很害怕
<i>I'm scared.</i>

300
00:24:25,694 --> 00:24:26,611
你在哪儿？
Where are you?

301
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:28,155
我不知道
<i>I don't know.</i>

302
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:30,991
Jinto  从头开始说
告诉我们你怎么到那儿的
Jinto start from the beginning.
Tell us how you got to where you are.

303
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:33,201
我在走廊上  在我的生活区外面
<i>I was in the hall, outside my quarters.</i>

304
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:42,085
然后呢？
Where did you go next?

305
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,337
我记不起来了
<i>I can't remember.</i>

306
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:47,174
他习惯丛林生活  可以在晚上辨识星星
He's used to the forest. Being able to see the stars at night.

307
00:24:47,382 --> 00:24:49,885
我发现了一个小屋
里面装满了地球上来的盒子
<i>I found a small room, filled with boxes from Earth.</i>

308
00:25:00,562 --> 00:25:01,897
盒子不见了
No boxes.

309
00:25:02,397 --> 00:25:03,523
它们在我这儿
<i>They are here with me.</i>

310
00:25:04,358 --> 00:25:05,692
这里用来做壁橱不错
This room would make a nice closet.

311
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:16,578
这一定不是壁橱
是不是你进来以后那个面板就开始发热了呢？
This is definitely not a closet.
Did the panel start to glow, when you stepped inside?

312
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,204
是啊
<i>Yes.</i>

313
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:18,038
你碰了它吗？
Did you touch it?

314
00:25:18,205 --> 00:25:18,705
是啊
<i>Yes</i>

315
00:25:18,914 --> 00:25:19,790
怎么碰的？
What exactly?

316
00:25:20,957 --> 00:25:22,125
记不起来了
<i>I don't remember</i>

317
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:25,837
在他消失之前  我们收到一个来自这个
区域的反常的能量信号
Just before he disappeared, we got
an unusual energy reading from this area here.

318
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:27,756
哦  不  不
Oh, no, no.

319
00:25:36,682 --> 00:25:40,143
- 一定是个运输机
- 现在还不急着给它起名字
- Must be a transporter.
- We can name it later.

320
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,197
Sheppard少校
Major Sheppard.

321
00:25:53,323 --> 00:25:56,159
Jinto  你还好吗？
Jinto, are you ok?

322
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:59,746
- 好的
-  我已经找到Jinto了  他很好
- Yes
- I've got Jinto, and he's ok.

323
00:26:07,963 --> 00:26:09,631
你知道这是什么地方吗？
Do you have any idea, what this place is?

324
00:26:09,673 --> 00:26:12,676
是个实验室之类的东西
我们以前见过一些
Some sort of research lab.
We've come across a few of them.

325
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:15,137
这些控制台通常用来登录
中央计算系统
These consoles generally access
the central computer system,

326
00:26:15,178 --> 00:26:17,139
所以Jinto可能在这里触发了刚才
我们以为的故障
so Jinto could have cause what
we thought were malfunctions, from here.

327
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,391
我必须知道你都碰了些什么东西
Look, I need to know,
everything you touched.

328
00:26:24,688 --> 00:26:27,566
从我目前的调查来看  应该只有一个物体
As far as I can tell, there's only one entity.

329
00:26:27,607 --> 00:26:30,402
蓝色的亮点是活动者的发生器
The bright blue spots
are the active naquadah generators.

330
00:26:30,444 --> 00:26:34,406
这个斑点是那个东西
只是感应器的校准问题
This blob is our entity.
It was just a matter of calibrating the sensors.

331
00:26:34,448 --> 00:26:37,492
你的主意很有用
到目前为止我都是占先的
Your idea's working.
So far I've been able to anticipate

332
00:26:37,534 --> 00:26:40,245
当它靠近活动的发生器时
我就遥控把发生器关掉
it's approach to the active generators,
and shut them off remotely.

333
00:26:40,287 --> 00:26:42,456
这儿  看
Here, watch.

334
00:26:43,415 --> 00:26:45,625
-  它现在只能团团转
- 干的好
- Got it going in circles.
- Good job.

335
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:46,668
谢谢
Thanks.

336
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,254
我希望我们没有使这东西发疯
I hope we're not making this thing mad.

337
00:26:52,466 --> 00:26:56,553
中尉？我是Groden博士
我侦测到那个物体向你那个方向前进
Lt? This is Doctor Groden.
I'm tracking the entity going your way.

338
00:26:56,595 --> 00:26:58,930
你最好不要站在走廊上
进到一个屋子里
You might want to get out of the hallway,
you're standing in.

339
00:26:58,972 --> 00:27:00,349
收到
Roger that!

340
00:27:09,524 --> 00:27:12,903
我是Ford
一道舱门挡住我我们的去路
This is Ford.
A bulkhead just blocked our way.

341
00:27:12,903 --> 00:27:16,073
门上没有面板
也没看见可以开门的东西
There's no panel on the wall,
or any way to open it that we can see.

342
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:17,866
-  收到
-  McKay？
- Roger that.
- McKay?

343
00:27:17,908 --> 00:27:21,495
我们没有碰任何东西  可能是那个东西
导致了随机产生的故障
We didn't touch anything. It could be
the entity, causing random malfuntions.

344
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:26,291
有这个大的一个东西干扰  这些古代的科技
很可能会出故障的
Proximity to that large an entity disturbance, could
cause the Ancient technology to go haywire.

345
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:29,836
中校  往回跑
试试走廊东侧的那道门
Lt double back and try the door
on the east side of the hall.

346
00:27:35,842 --> 00:27:38,553
- 这扇门也打不开
- 它来了
- This door won't open, either.
- Here it comes.

347
00:27:38,595 --> 00:27:40,889
打开墙上的控制台
Open the console on the wall.

348
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:44,935
快
Hurry!

349
00:27:45,977 --> 00:27:48,563
-  接下来呢
-  我不清楚  你看到什么？
- What next?
- I'm not sure. What do you see?

350
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:52,567
- 3个水晶
- 取出中间一个  把上面那个往下推
- Three crystals.
- Take out the middle one, pull the top one down.

351
00:27:57,948 --> 00:28:00,158
如果门开的话  快跑
If this door opens, go.

352
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:02,327
我会跟在你后面
I'll be right behind you.

353
00:28:03,996 --> 00:28:05,455
没用
It's not working.

354
00:28:05,497 --> 00:28:07,666
用中间那个把其他两个连接上
Ok, use the middle one to bridge the two others.

355
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:10,752
-  你确定吗？
- 不确定
- You sure about this?
- Not exactly.

356
00:28:15,424 --> 00:28:16,466
跑！
Go!

357
00:28:31,898 --> 00:28:34,276
派人下来  这里需要医疗
Man down, I need a medical team.

358
00:28:40,532 --> 00:28:42,784
好的  你们别动
Right, hang in there.

359
00:28:45,662 --> 00:28:48,790
- 我们这儿是不是有危险？
- 我希望我能告诉你
- Are we in any danger here?
- I wish I could tell you.

360
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,502
- Ford怎么了？
- 他就像被闪电击中了一样
- How's Ford?
- It's like he was hit by lightening.

361
00:28:52,544 --> 00:28:55,714
- 他会没事吗？
- 他很强壮的
- He's gonna be ok?
- He's a tough kid.

362
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:02,346
长官
Sir.

363
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,934
Hi
Hi.

364
00:29:11,104 --> 00:29:14,524
你可以跟他说
其实他没有责任吗？
Will you tell this guy,
there's nothing he could have done?

365
00:29:15,484 --> 00:29:17,944
你没有责任
There is nothing you could have done.

366
00:29:17,986 --> 00:29:20,280
我本可以把他拉出来的  长官
I could have tried to pull him out sir.

367
00:29:20,322 --> 00:29:22,949
那我们就一起躺在床上了
Then we'd both look like this.

368
00:29:22,991 --> 00:29:24,117
哦  你看起来还不是很糟
Ah, you don't look so bad.

369
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,372
Beckett博士说你很快就会恢复原样了
Dr Beckett says you're gonna
be back to pretty boy, in no time.

370
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:35,128
-  显然这也是一个升降舵
- 真的？
- Apparently it's also an elevator.
- Really?

371
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,713
你可以不用带着楼梯到处跑了
You can stop taking the stairs everywhere.

372
00:29:36,713 --> 00:29:39,007
- 你们真是好人
- 你发现了什么吗？
- Oh, how nice for you all.
- What have you got?

373
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:43,470
信不信由你  Jinto没有动其他东西导致不良结果
除了那个
Well believe it or not, Jinto didn't touch
anything of any consequence, other than that.

374
00:29:48,141 --> 00:29:51,395
他一定有自己的能量源
就像“跳跃者”一样
It must have it's own power source,
like the Jumpers.

375
00:29:51,436 --> 00:29:52,646
这是什么？
What is it?

376
00:29:52,688 --> 00:29:55,857
这有点像核反应堆的安全壳
提供能源的
Well it's some sort of containment vessel,
for the energy creature.

377
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:57,609
Jinto释放了它？
And Jinto released it?

378
00:29:57,651 --> 00:30:00,153
看起来是这样的
而且据我看
Well, it seems that way.
As I suggested,

379
00:30:00,195 --> 00:30:02,823
这些能量就是导致技术问题的根源
the energies must be causing
most of the technical problems.

380
00:30:02,823 --> 00:30:05,367
它会被观测捕捉到
It was captured for observation.

381
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:08,412
古代人正研究升天技术
The Ancients were researching ascension.

382
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:11,748
- 真的？
- 什么是升天技术？
- Really?
- What exactly is ascension?

383
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,751
在他们进化的某个阶段
古代人到达了
Well at some point during their evolution,
the Ancients reached a...

384
00:30:14,793 --> 00:30:18,255
一个更高的境界  他们可以脱离
他们的躯壳
an advanced stage of being, where they were able
to rid themselves of their physical bodies,

385
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:22,342
升到一个更高的地方
并以纯能量的形式存在着
and rise to a higher plane of existence.
One in which they live as pure energy.

386
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:26,596
我知道听起来有些荒谬
但这是第一个线索
I know it sounds ridiculous,
but this is the first indication

387
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:29,725
可能有一种力量阻挠了这种进化
that there may have been evolutionary
intervention to get there.

388
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:31,977
是他们的基因治疗吗？
A little gene therapy of their own huh?

389
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:35,981
呃  我还没读过所有的笔记
但我知道那个怪物是个能量体
Well I haven't read all the notes, but
what I do know, is that the entity is energy.

390
00:30:36,023 --> 00:30:39,901
它靠能量存活  Ford很幸运
我是说  它吃得越多 体积会变得越大
It feeds on energy. Fords lucky, I mean,
the more it feeds, the bigger it gets.

391
00:30:39,943 --> 00:30:43,196
它变得越大  就会吸收更多的能量
这样会更致命
The bigger it gets, the more charged it becomes.
The more deadly it will be.

392
00:30:43,238 --> 00:30:45,324
它是智能的吗？
Is it intelligent?

393
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:47,701
根据研究结果
它是有意识的
Well according to the research,
it is sentient.

394
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:50,787
但如果你想和它说话
那估计比和一只大白鲨说话还难
But if you tried to talk to it, you'd have
more luck with a great white shark.

395
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:55,417
这个东西会把发生器的所有能量吸走
那样我们就都完蛋了
This thing is going to suck the power out
of our generators, and then it will kill us all.

396
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:57,919
好的  那我们该怎么做
Alright, what will we do about it?

397
00:30:57,961 --> 00:31:00,881
自从古代人丢弃了这个城市开始
那个东西就一直被困在这儿了
The entity's been trapped in here, since before
the Ancient's abandoned the city.

398
00:31:00,922 --> 00:31:03,425
-  我知道我会生气的
- 而且很饿
- I know I'd be pissed.
- And hungry.

399
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:06,386
重点是  这个设备是设计来
The point is,
this device was designed to track it,

400
00:31:06,428 --> 00:31:09,431
跟踪  捕捉它的
capture it, and hold it for observation.

401
00:31:09,431 --> 00:31:11,725
我们仍然有机会把它赶回去
There's still a chance we may be able to get it back inside.

402
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:13,894
我需要再多一些时间来找到方法
I'm just gonna need a little more time to figure how.

403
00:31:25,614 --> 00:31:29,159
- Hello
- Jinto有话要说
- Hello
- Jinto has something he wishes to say.

404
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:34,581
对不起  都是我的错
I'm sorry. What happened to you was my fault.

405
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:37,584
我的家乡有句俗话
Where I come from, we've got a little saying.

406
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,462
是福不是祸  是祸躲不过
Stuff happens.

407
00:31:40,462 --> 00:31:44,549
这次情况有些不同
但你不是有意的  是吗？
It's a little different, but you didn't mean
for this to happen, did you?

408
00:31:46,551 --> 00:31:49,096
嗯  你是个好孩子
No. You're a good kid.

409
00:31:49,137 --> 00:31:53,266
你没有做错事
你也没有什么错  OK？
You weren't doing anything wrong,
which means this isn't your fault, ok?

410
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:00,982
就像我们到你们的星球一样
Same as when we came to your planet?

411
00:32:00,982 --> 00:32:03,568
我们不希望幽灵出现
但他们就是出现了
We didn't mean for the Wraith to show up,
they just did.

412
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,821
这也是你在这儿的原因
你的家没了
That's why you're here.
Your home was destroyed.

413
00:32:05,862 --> 00:32:09,992
你还差点失去父亲
我记得你不曾为了这件事对我生气
You almost lost your dad. I don't
remember you getting mad with me over that.

414
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:12,744
是福不是祸  是祸躲不过
Stuff happens.

415
00:32:26,383 --> 00:32:28,427
它不再中计了
It's not falling for the same tricks anymore.

416
00:32:28,427 --> 00:32:30,679
- 它有多聪明？
- Rodney？
- How smart is this thing?
- Rodney?

417
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:33,432
我不知道
但这比我想的要简单
I don't know.
But this is much simpler than I thought.

418
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:35,267
就像一个捕鼠器
It's kind of like a mousetrap.

419
00:32:35,308 --> 00:32:39,354
这里的按钮使设备发射出能量信号
吸引那个东西
This button here, causes the device to emit
an energy signature that attracts the creature.

420
00:32:39,396 --> 00:32:41,314
这里  则是关掉能量信号的
This one, shuts it in.

421
00:32:41,356 --> 00:32:43,025
现在只有往下走
Now the only downside, is it looks like

422
00:32:43,066 --> 00:32:45,485
看起来好像得有人在这里按着这按钮
someone's actually gonna have
to be here to press the buttons.

423
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:49,614
- 我来
- 好的
- I'll do it.
- Ok

424
00:32:49,656 --> 00:32:52,701
等一下  Rodney
你还带着保护层
Wait a minute Rodney.
You're still wearing the shield.

425
00:32:52,743 --> 00:32:56,413
是不是意味着如果发生意外的话
它会保护你？
Is there a chance that if something went wrong,
that would protect you?

426
00:33:10,344 --> 00:33:12,054
我有预感
I had a feeling.

427
00:33:12,095 --> 00:33:14,890
你说什么
预感什么？
What do you mean?
Had a feeling about what?

428
00:33:15,766 --> 00:33:18,352
你是说我刚才想着让它脱落吗？
You think I wanted to come off just now?

429
00:33:18,352 --> 00:33:20,437
你认为我害怕了吗？
我才不怕呢  让我来
You think I'm scared?
I'm not scared, I'll do this.

430
00:33:20,437 --> 00:33:22,522
不  没关系
你可能会再晕过去
No that's ok.
You might faint again.

431
00:33:22,564 --> 00:33:25,025
不  这个不起作用了
Look, it's just not working anymore. Look,

432
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:26,651
它在你身上也不起作用
it doesn't work on you either.

433
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:28,862
我只是不想让你去死
I just meant that I wasn't going to let you die.

434
00:33:28,904 --> 00:33:32,866
这只是一个巧合  它刚好失效了
我要喝水！
It's just a coincidence that it happened
to stop working now. I need a drink!

435
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,661
走
Go.

436
00:33:51,593 --> 00:33:54,513
你一直告诉我
我不该害怕黑暗
You always told me,
I shouldn't be afraid of the dark.

437
00:33:57,015 --> 00:33:58,684
我错了
Well, I was wrong.

438
00:33:58,725 --> 00:34:01,353
我现在睡不着
I can't sleep now.

439
00:34:01,395 --> 00:34:03,563
如果黑暗来临怎么办？
What if the darkness comes?

440
00:34:03,605 --> 00:34:05,565
不会的
It won't.

441
00:34:05,941 --> 00:34:08,068
你怎么知道
How do you know?

442
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,153
因为
Because.

443
00:34:14,783 --> 00:34:16,952
它害怕火光
It's afraid of fire.

444
00:34:17,911 --> 00:34:19,871
黑暗害怕了？
The darkness is afraid?

445
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:26,712
所谓一物降一物
Everything is afraid of something.

446
00:34:54,781 --> 00:34:57,451
那个保护层自己脱落了
So the shield device,
just came off by itself.

447
00:34:57,492 --> 00:35:00,245
是啊  正巧失效了
Yeah. It just stopped working.

448
00:35:00,287 --> 00:35:02,289
他还在Sheppard身上试了试
He even tried it on Sheppard.

449
00:35:02,289 --> 00:35:04,458
在Sheppard身上是无效的
It wouldn't work on Sheppard.

450
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:06,960
为什么？
Why not?

451
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,298
McKay没跟你说吗？
文献上说  保护层在佩戴者身上留下烙印
McKay didn't tell you? The text we studied,
said the shield imprints on the wearer

452
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,884
如果我们没搞错的话  它对其他人是无效的
If we were right, it wouldn't work on anyone else

453
00:35:17,971 --> 00:35:20,265
准备好了吗？
We're ready?

454
00:35:20,265 --> 00:35:24,144
你应该清楚如果我们把所有设备关掉
我们将失去传感器
You do realise that when we shut everything
down, we're going to lose the sensors.

455
00:35:24,186 --> 00:35:25,437
我们就没法对它定位了
We're not going to be able to track it.

456
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:28,482
我们派了安保人员
在生活区四处巡逻
We have security personnel,
posted around the living quarters.

457
00:35:28,482 --> 00:35:30,275
至少我们有个警报系统
At least we have some warning.

458
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:38,158
Teyla告诉一个Ethosian孩子
点亮的蜡烛会保护他们
Teyla told the Ethosian children, that lighting
a candle will help protect them.

459
00:35:38,992 --> 00:35:41,787
- 你这么做是因为……
- 这里会变黑
- And you're doing it because....
- It's gonna get dark in here.

460
00:35:47,793 --> 00:35:50,587
好了  少校  开始吧
Ok Major. Go ahead.

461
00:35:59,763 --> 00:36:01,223
现在
Now.

462
00:36:02,974 --> 00:36:04,726
关掉电源
Shutting down power.

463
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:30,711
他来了
It's coming.

464
00:36:39,761 --> 00:36:42,055
我想我们需要一艘更大的船
I think we're gonna need a bigger boat.

465
00:36:42,055 --> 00:36:44,474
- 大小没关系
- 真是个神话
- Size doesn't matter.
- That's a myth.

466
00:36:44,474 --> 00:36:47,352
它会进得去
那个设备会把它吸进去
It'll fit. The device traps the creature inside.

467
00:36:47,394 --> 00:36:49,771
你只要保证它进到那个安全壳里就行了
You just need to make sure, it's all
the way inside the containment vessel

468
00:36:54,401 --> 00:36:56,194
好的  来吧
Alright, come on.

469
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:15,088
该死的
Son of a bitch.

470
00:37:15,088 --> 00:37:16,214
怎么了？
What happened?

471
00:37:16,256 --> 00:37:18,592
那个东西看了一眼   然后走了
The damn thing took one look and went away.

472
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:21,595
它比我想象的聪明多了
It's a lot smarter than we thought.

473
00:37:28,227 --> 00:37:30,605
我们需要知道到哪儿了  现在
We need to know where it is, right now.

474
00:37:30,646 --> 00:37:32,648
我们必须打开开关  打开传感器
We'll have to turn the power on, to use the sensors.

475
00:37:32,648 --> 00:37:35,610
- 你不能这样做
- 就这样做  只开启控制塔
- You can't do that.
- Do it, just the operations tower.

476
00:37:38,655 --> 00:37:41,157
现在怎么了？
What now?

477
00:37:41,157 --> 00:37:44,202
- 它朝着这个方向去了
- 因为你有打开了开关
- It's headed this way.
- Because you turned the power back on.

478
00:37:44,243 --> 00:37:45,703
我们不能再这样下去了
We can't go on like this.

479
00:37:45,703 --> 00:37:48,122
你们认为它想呆在这儿吗？
Do you think it wants to be here?

480
00:37:49,248 --> 00:37:51,042
什么意思？
What do you mean?

481
00:37:51,084 --> 00:37:54,420
它被困在这儿已有千年  孑然一身
It's been trapped here for thousands of years, alone.

482
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,505
这里不再寂寞了呀
It's not alone anymore.

483
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:58,424
它的思维没有到这个高度
它只会想吃的 仅此而已
It doesn't think on that level.
It thinks about eating, that's it.

484
00:37:58,466 --> 00:38:00,927
- 你知道什么
- 如果我们呆在这儿  它会杀了我们
- You would know.
- If we stay, it will kill us.

485
00:38:00,927 --> 00:38:03,763
-  除非我们先把它杀了
- 可是我看不到杀它的希望
- Not unless we kill it first.
- Well, I don't see how.

486
00:38:03,805 --> 00:38:06,182
也就是说不是我们走就是它走
Then either we must go, or it must.

487
00:38:06,224 --> 00:38:09,477
也许它想离开
Maybe it wants to go.

488
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,648
如果我们打开星际门
If we open the Stargate.

489
00:38:19,487 --> 00:38:21,072
这主意真烂
This is a bad idea.

490
00:38:21,114 --> 00:38:23,950
- 你说过好多遍了
- 可是这值得说上一万遍
- You've said that already.
- Well, it's worth saying again.

491
00:38:33,084 --> 00:38:35,128
它来了！
It's coming!

492
00:38:35,169 --> 00:38:37,880
打开的星际门是一个巨大的能量源
它真聪明
An open stargate, is a huge power source.
This thing is smart.

493
00:38:37,922 --> 00:38:40,216
它足够聪明  不会再被困在一个安全壳里了
It knew enough, not to get trapped
in the containment vessel again.

494
00:38:40,258 --> 00:38:43,261
那你凭什么认为它会随着一个发生器进入虫洞里呢？
What makes you think it's going to follow
a naquadah generator through a wormhole?

495
00:38:43,302 --> 00:38:45,346
什么  你有更好的主意吗？
What, you got a better idea?

496
00:38:47,557 --> 00:38:49,600
好运！
Good luck!

497
00:38:49,642 --> 00:38:51,769
你行吗？
Are you ok?

498
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:56,524
它快来了
It's almost here.

499
00:38:57,525 --> 00:39:01,696
- 你们有地址吗？
- M4X 337  贫瘠的荒地
- Do you have an address?
- M4X 337, barren wasteland

500
00:39:01,738 --> 00:39:03,740
接通
Dial it.

501
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:08,953
想法不错
That was good thinking.

502
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,745
它没有进去
It's not going anywhere.

503
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:53,498
我们看不见它是否进去了
We can't see if the malp got through.

504
00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:54,874
那个东西可能会耗尽电池
The entity could have drained the battery.

505
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:57,794
它可能会吸收星际门以及发生器的能量
那样就糟了
It could be feeding off the stargate,
off the generator. This is a disaster.

506
00:39:57,794 --> 00:39:59,754
关掉
Shut it down.

507
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:04,884
- 关不掉
- 控制台失效了
- I can't.
- The consoles are dead.

508
00:40:08,763 --> 00:40:11,015
一定还有挽救的措施
There must be something we can do.

509
00:40:11,015 --> 00:40:13,017
我们不知道它是否还在那儿
We don't know if the malp is still down there.

510
00:40:13,851 --> 00:40:16,145
也许那个东西还是会穿过星际门
It's possible that the entity will still go through the gate,

511
00:40:16,187 --> 00:40:19,107
一旦它耗尽了发生器的能量的话
once it's depleted the energy
in the naquadah generator, on the malp.

512
00:40:19,148 --> 00:40:21,609
或者它会吸掉星际门的能量
Or it could just continue to feed off the gates energy.

513
00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:47,051
McKay！
McKay!

514
00:40:54,225 --> 00:40:55,351
Rodney！
Rodney!

515
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,334
Mckay？
McKay?

516
00:42:03,252 --> 00:42:05,546
能量一定都被那个东西耗尽了
The power must have been drained by the entity.

517
00:42:05,588 --> 00:42:07,840
医疗队马上到门厅来
Medical team to the gateroom.

518
00:42:07,882 --> 00:42:11,552
他没有被灼伤  他有呼吸
He's not burned. He's breathing.

519
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,683
McKay？
McKay?

520
00:42:16,683 --> 00:42:18,726
McKay
McKay

521
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,814
- 怎么了？
- 你成功了
- What append?
- you did it.

522
00:42:24,065 --> 00:42:25,942
成功了？
I did?

523
00:42:25,984 --> 00:42:27,735
它穿过那扇门了
It went through the gate.

524
00:42:30,655 --> 00:42:33,241
你一定死过一回了
You must have passed out.

525
00:42:33,282 --> 00:42:36,577
谢谢你们没说什么别的
Well thanks for not saying the other thing.

526
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:43,209
这真是个万福玛丽亚
That, was a Hail Mary.

527
00:42:53,052 --> 00:42:58,391
谢谢  不急
我没事


Thankyou, take your time.
Man down.
