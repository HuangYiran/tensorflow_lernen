让蓝精灵在这个世界上有一席之地

29
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,110
Time to smurf some magic.

30
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,530
Let's see.

31
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,200
There you are.

32
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,120
Mimosa pollen.

33
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,210
Yes, tiger lily

34
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,630
to make her essence magical and blue.

35
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,300
Unless this spell be all for naught,

36
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,310
the final thing, one hopeful thought.

37
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,400
Once upon a time, in Smurf Village,

38
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,410
happy Smurfs were going about their happy lives

39
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,580
completely unaware that not too far away,

40
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,750
the evil wizard Gargamel

41
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,500
was concocting a diabolical plan.

42
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,510
Hey.

43
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,920
Hey!

44
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,970
Smooth, you're upstaging the narrator.

45
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,260
Yo, take it down a notch, my blues brothers.

46
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,350
- All right. All right. - Thank you. Anyway...

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,850
So Gargamel said,

48
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,600
"I am making my own irresistible creation,

49
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:06,190
"the Smurfette, to infiltrate their village and betray the Smurfs."

50
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,790
Wow.

51
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,290
Not a good look on her.

52
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,960
- She's a Frankensmurf? - Yes.

53
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,220
And her naughty nature took Smurf Village by storm.

54
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,600
She even flooded our village.

55
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,060
The Smurfs wanted her gone,

56
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,230
but even though she was Gargamel's creation, Papa saw the good in her.

57
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,490
With love, kindness, a complete makeover, and a secret magic formula,

58
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,820
he turned her into a true-blue Smurf,

59
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,580
and that is how our darling Smurfette came to be.

60
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,750
- Hi. - Holy moly.

61
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,250
Hi, Smurfette.

62
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,590
I wish I had that hair.

63
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,680
- Nice dive, Smurfette. - That was amazing.

64
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,720
Wow. Show-off.

65
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,850
Pretty!

66
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,270
- That was so purty. - Nice tuck and roll.

67
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,060
- Hi! - Like a beautiful mermaid.

68
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,900
Wait, how is her hair still dry?

69
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,360
Oh, no.

70
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,990
What...

71
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,120
Stupid, trusting Smurfs.

72
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,990
You're mine now.

73
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,000
- It's alive! - Smurf for the hills!

74
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,830
Don't kill the narrator!

75
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,960
The world as we know it is over!

76
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,000
She's got a Dragon Wand.

77
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,760
Don't hurt my cupcake!

78
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
Look out!

79
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,720
Yes! My beautiful creation.

80
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,100
You truly are daddy's little girl.

81
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,070
No...

82
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,820
Smurfette, are you okay?

83
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,200
Oh, Papa.

84
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,410
There, there. Everything's going to be fine.

85
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Having that nightmare again?

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,750
Papa, every year on my birthday,

87
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,840
I have these horrible dreams about where I come from,

88
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,510
and it makes me wonder who I really am.

89
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,720
And every year, I remind you, it doesn't matter where you came from.

90
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,640
What matters is who you choose to be.

91
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,520
Really?

92
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,150
Don't take this old Smurf's word for it.

93
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,690
Go out there and see for yourself.

94
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,110
This is where you belong.

95
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,780
You belong to Gargamel.

96
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,370
You belong to Gargamel.

97
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,080
"You belong to Gargamel." Say it.

98
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,750
"You belong to Gargamel."

99
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,130
"I, I."

100
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,210
"I, I."

101
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,300
You know what? Never mind, sir. You're a dim-witted toad.

102
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,220
"You're a dim-witted toad, sir?"

103
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,390
No, actually, you are!

104
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,850
There.

105
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,190
Yet another groundbreaking feat of illusion

106
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,190
from the most innovative conjurer the world has ever seen.

107
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,690
Gargamania,

108
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:37,150
the magical sensation that has captivated the nation from New York to Las Vegas,

109
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,240
is now taking on the City of Light, Paris, France.

110
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,160
This master mysterio has gone from unknown to unstoppable

111
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,580
after a surprise discovery in New York.

112
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,340
Yo, get out of the road, freak!

113
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,920
How dare you? How dare you call me "Yo"?

114
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,090
Hey, no, put my car down.

115
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,930
Yo, how do you like it up there?

116
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,390
Moron.

117
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,230
From New York street performer to the new toast of Europe,

118
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,110
the only magician ever to play the famed Paris Opera House.

119
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,360
Stay tuned.

120
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,540
Oh, dear gods, can we please just have one quiet carriage ride

121
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,620
without you tormenting me about using up all the Smurf essence?

122
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,040
I extracted all I could from Papa Smurf in the kingdom of New York.

123
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,880
How much essence did you extract?

124
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,470
I'm squandering it?

125
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,630
What are you talking about?

126
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,140
I had to turn that man into a giant toad. It's a magic show, isn't it?

127
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,600
Because without Smurf essence, I can't...

128
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,480
Why am I even discussing this with you? You don't have any magic!

129
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,810
Stick that on your Facebook page and lick it.

130
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,480
Like it. Like it. Whatever.

131
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,940
Besides,

132
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,450
I still have plenty enough essence left to carry out my delightfully diabolical plan.

133
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,700
Now, my adoring public desires me.

134
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,620
Hello!

135
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,910
Hello, my lowly little bootlicks.

136
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,170
Yes, you must all worship me.

137
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,250
Yes.

138
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,340
Even you, my flea-bitten little fur bag.

139
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,050
All hail the great and powerful...

140
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,100
Azrael... Azrael... Stop it.

141
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,180
Open it! Open it!

142
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,730
Come, Azrael. Hurry up.

143
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,700
Hello, handsome.

144
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,540
Look, a present.

145
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,950
No doubt from a worshipping admirer.

146
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
It's for you.

147
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,800
You are not more popular than I am.

148
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,300
A little green dot?

149
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,680
Why do you get all the little green dots?

150
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,510
Get it, get it.

151
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,970
Father's going to love this.

152
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,060
- Hackus want to play. - Hey!

153
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,390
Let Hackus play with the kitty.

154
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,730
Cover me.

155
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,850
I'm going in.

156
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,400
Hello, kitty.

157
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,730
Vexy!

158
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,570
All right, my little Naughties.

159
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,030
Yeah!

160
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,070
Hackus to the rescue!

161
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,490
Booyah!

162
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,620
Good save, Hackus.

163
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,830
Pull, pull!

164
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,750
Hackus cat-fishing. Caught a big one.

165
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,920
And round 12 goes to the Naughties.

166
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,050
Well said, my dim brother.

167
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,420
Apparently, it wasn't a gift, Azrael.

168
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,930
It was a trap.

169
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,640
- Very amusing, my little Naughties. - Hey!

170
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,890
Did we please you, Father?

171
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,970
No, no, you didn't.

172
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,850
You know what would please me, Vexy, if you were blue like real Smurfs,

173
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,360
then your essence would endow me with real magic like that of a true-blue Smurf.

174
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,360
That would excite me.

175
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,240
Instead, you're both just deeply disappointing experiments.

176
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,530
Experiment?

177
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,620
Like my traitorous Smurfette.

178
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,830
The banner goes over there, please. Thank you, and I love the pinata.

179
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,210
- How's that, Gutsy? - A little lower, Grouchy.

180
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,960
I want to be able to whack him right in the smurf berries.

181
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,960
Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy.

182
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,220
What a cake! Smurfette's gonna love this party!

183
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,930
Hey, who smurfed a bite out of Smurfette's birthday cake?

184
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,010
- Not me. - I don't know.

185
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,140
- Greedy? - What? Why you all looking at me?

186
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,390
Hey, Brainy, here's my present for Smurfette's surprise party.

187
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,020
Come on, Jokey, do you really think that I, the smartest Smurf in the village,

188
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,980
- would fall for your sophomoric gag? - Yep.

189
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,820
Just give me the card.

190
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,070
Out-smurfed by a simpleton.

191
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,160
- She's coming. Smurfette's coming. - Oh, no! The surprise will be ruined.

192
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Code blue! Code blue! Repeat, this is not a drill. Code blue.

193
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,410
Undo it, unglue it!

194
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,830
We gotta get her out of here!

195
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,040
Here she is! Act natural!

196
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,500
Hey, guys.

197
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,170
Anyone want to do anything fun on this special day?

198
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,170
Hey, Vanity.

199
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,590
Want to sit by the fountain and look at your reflection?

200
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,640
Kind of tired of looking at myself, Smurfette.

201
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,930
As if.

202
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,930
Nope, not building anything for anybody.

203
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,020
- Hey, Party Planner. - Hey.

204
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,930
- Hey, Social Smurf. - Yes, darling?

205
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,100
Anything fun coming up that I should know about?

206
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,440
No, nothing till Smurfapalooza.

207
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,860
It's going to be wild, right, Social Smurf?

208
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,610
Yeah. I've got it all over the Smurf Web. It's got 101 likes on Smurf book.

209
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,070
I will put you on the guest list.

210
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,280
So, no one remembered my birthday?

211
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,370
The surprise is gonna be ruined!

212
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,410
Hush up! Hush up!

213
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:46,300
You know, Smurfette, occasionally, it's good to have a little alone time.

214
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,800
- Yeah, so take a hike. - Yeah, we don't need you here, we're good.

215
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
- Bye. - There you go.

216
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,470
See you.

217
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,430
We fooled her pretty good, don't you think, Clueless Smurf?

218
00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:00,140
Yeah! She's got no idea about the surprise party!

219
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,560
Dude.

220
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,740
Maybe I really don't belong here.

221
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,860
Happy birthday to you

222
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,360
Happy birthday to you

223
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,530
Happy birthday to Blue

224
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,120
Happy birthday to you

225
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,090
Okay, blow out the candles, Blue.

226
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,750
Nice.

227
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,300
Okay, I think I've got everyone's issues covered here.

228
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,100
This is an organic, gluten-free, antioxidant-rich acai berry cake

229
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:43,020
made locally by a cruelty-free baker who swears he's never even seen a peanut.

230
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,730
Everybody good? Right?

231
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,610
- Are these plates PCB-free? - No.

232
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:52,030
- Actually, we're good. - Actually, we're good. PCB and BPA-free.

233
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,320
Daddy, can we cut the cake?

234
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,490
- Yeah. - All right, let's do that.

235
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,740
Cut it.

236
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,030
Boy, who thought parenting could be so complicated?

237
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,370
- Yummy. - Seriously, guys?

238
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,450
You guys make it look easy.

239
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,540
Yeah, you must have had a great role model.

240
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,670
No, not really.

241
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,540
- My dad took off when I was five, so... - Am I late?

242
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500
Did I miss all the presents?

243
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,550
Hey!

244
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,340
- Grandpa Vicster! - Hey!

245
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,430
Happy birthday, Blue.

246
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,760
Now it's a party. Hello.

247
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,270
I'm Victor, Patrick's dad.

248
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,850
And you must all be his friends, which makes you my friends.

249
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,940
So let's go.

250
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,690
Arms in the air, you're all getting hugs.

251
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,900
Hey, okay.

252
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,480
I thought you said your father left you.

253
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,780
He did. This is my stepfather.

254
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,450
You'll want him to leave. Just wait.

255
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,490
Hello. Where's my Gracie?

256
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,490
- Hey. - Victor.

257
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,040
How are you?

258
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,250
You know, ever since Blue was born,

259
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,920
I kind of miss you being as big as a house with more of you to hug.

260
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,040
Yep.

261
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,670
And now, I've saved the biggest hug for last.

262
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,960
- Boundaries, please. Boundaries. - Let's show them how it's done.

263
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,590
Unhand me.

264
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,260
I don't like this at all.

265
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,970
Thank you.

266
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,810
There's nothing like the embrace of two proud Doyle men.

267
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,180
I am not a Doyle man.

268
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,350
Little Paddy Doyle.

269
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,810
- Winslow. - Okay, compromise. Winslow.

270
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,690
Hyphen-Doyle.

271
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,530
Hey, isn't he the guy from the Korndog commercials on TV?

272
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,690
- Hey, you're right. - Well, you got me.

273
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,110
- Korndog King. - No, no, no.

274
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,160
- One moment. - Please not this.

275
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,700
Now, in honour of Blue's birthday,

276
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,410
I'm going to present each and every one of you with a free Korndog...

277
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
- Thank you. - ...on the house.

278
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,040
Teriaki dog.

279
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,500
That's for you.

280
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,330
Do these have any peanuts?

281
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,000
I would never put peanuts in a Korndog.

282
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,170
Great.

283
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,670
Go ahead, big guy, it's okay.

284
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,680
For the simple reason, you see, we deep-fry them in peanut oil.

285
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Peanut oil?

286
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,600
- What? - Johnny, spit it... Spit it out right away!

287
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,220
Okay, I got the phone, okay.

288
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,730
Spit it out, Johnny! Spit it out right away! Into Mama's hands.

289
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,890
Deep breath for the EpiPen.

290
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,230
- It's okay. - What's happening to that kid's lips?

291
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,030
- Azrael, bring me my plan. - Father?

292
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,160
It's in the bathroom. Check my side of the sink.

293
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Father?

294
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,950
It's feeding time.

295
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,830
Hackus dizzy.

296
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,000
Yes, I almost forgot.

297
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,420
Apparently, I have to keep you alive.

298
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,840
I hope you both appreciate what a tremendous burden this is upon me.

299
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,130
All right, mind your manners.

300
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,550
Thank you.

301
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,840
If you were real Smurfs, I'd be taking essence from you.

302
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,510
I didn't hear a "thank you."

303
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,310
Close enough. Come, come.

304
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,600
We must review my plan before tonight's raid on Smurf Village.

305
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,730
This is not my writing parchment. Where is my plan?

306
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,730
"Gone digital"?

307
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,950
I don't understand what that means.

308
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,450
Yes, phase one, "Create Naughties." Yes.

309
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,620
Check. Where is phase two?

310
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,960
I am enamoured of that swiping motion.

311
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,710
Yes, get away, get away, get away, get away.

312
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,750
Phase three... Swipe.

313
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,720
I capture my ungrateful daughter

314
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,010
and force her to tell me the secret formula that Papa used to turn her blue.

315
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,180
Swipe.

316
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,390
I turn you and hundreds other like you blue.

317
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,470
Hackus blue!

318
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,480
Hackus blue!

319
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,400
I place you into a terrifying machine and extract your essence.

320
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
- What? - And then,

321
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,610
the entire world shall bow before me!

322
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,610
Will that extracting thing hurt?

323
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,280
It's excruciatingly painless.

324
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,490
You'll see, it'll be fun, for me.

325
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,580
Anyway, we're getting ahead of ourselves.

326
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:36,080
Back to phase two, the very reason we came to this cheese-infested metropolis.

327
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,590
The great iron spire.

328
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,260
The only possible way

329
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,840
to harness enough energy to create a portal right into the heart of Smurf Village.

330
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,600
How I love portal creation.

331
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,770
Come, come, let us away! To the iron spire!

332
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,940
It worked!

333
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,560
Yes! Just enough essence!

334
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,660
And now I will go down in history!

335
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,620
Nothing can stop me now!

336
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,420
My Gargaberries!

337
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
Oh, no!

338
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,140
Now I shall prove my genius!

339
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,220
Head spin!

340
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:24,280
It appears I lack sufficient essence to create a human-size portal.

341
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,570
Father, I can fit through there. Let me get Smurfette.

342
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,700
Hackus go! Hackus go!

343
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,200
- Hey! - Hackus go!

344
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,240
Yes, yes. Well, let's see here.

345
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,040
- Eeny, meeny, miny... - Pick me! Pick me!

346
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,170
Moron.

347
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,210
Yes!

348
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,340
- Hey, Hackus, listen to this. - What?

349
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,630
I win.

350
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,380
Nicely played, Vexy.

351
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,050
Now, I must warn you.

352
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,720
Your destination is a true horror.

353
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,310
A realm filled with the relentless crushing quiet of peace,

354
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,600
punctuated by the wretched cacophony of joyousness.

355
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,440
- It's horrible. - What a nightmare.

356
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,900
Yes, yes, it completely ruined your sister.

357
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,270
It's such a shame when a bad girl turns good.

358
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
So true.

359
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,990
But she does know the secret formula,

360
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,320
so go get Smurfette!

361
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,080
I just don't get it.

362
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,290
They know how tough my birthday can be,

363
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,250
and they didn't even remember.

364
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,170
Maybe Papa was wrong.

365
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,180
Guess I'll never really be one of them.

366
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,680
- Oh, no! - Help.

367
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,440
Please, wait.

368
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,020
I escaped.

369
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,360
Escaped?

370
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,900
From the evil wizard who made me.

371
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,110
Do you mean Gargamel?

372
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,780
Is Gargamel your father?

373
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,330
Yes.

374
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,040
But he's...

375
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,920
That means you're just like me.

376
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,170
- Gotcha! - What are you doing?

377
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,210
Father's going to be very happy.

378
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,960
Smurfette's in trouble!

379
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,170
- Crikey! - Oh, no!

380
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,300
- Come on, Smurfs! - Smurfette!

381
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,970
No!

382
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,800
- Oh, no, you don't. - No!

383
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,390
- Let go! - Now get in there!

384
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,020
Oh, no!

385
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,230
- She's being smurf napped. - Unhand her!

386
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,020
So long, Smurfs.

387
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,150
- Smurfette! - Smurfette!

388
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,360
What are we gonna do now?

389
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,280
My powers of deduction lead me to believe that this is the work of Gargamel.

390
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,410
Oh, no, oh, no!

391
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,080
- Yes! - Pretty blue.

392
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,500
Gargamel.

393
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,710
Smurfette. Welcome home.

394
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,510
You're wasting your time, Gargamel.

395
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,310
Papa and the others are gonna come for me.

396
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,230
I don't think so.

397
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,850
They came for Clumsy.

398
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,610
Yes, but you see, Clumsy was a real Smurf.

399
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,900
Whereas I was the one who created you.

400
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,530
You do remember that, don't you, dear?

401
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,450
You're not my father. Just let me go home.

402
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,870
Of course.

403
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,250
Anything you say,

404
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:30,380
but first, I will need one itsy-bitsy, teeny-tiny little thing first.

405
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,510
- Teeny-tiny. - What?

406
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:38,550
Just the secret formula that Papa used to turn you into a real Smurf.

407
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,390
Hackus real Smurf. Hackus blue!

408
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,680
Like you, blondie.

409
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,230
It would benefit us both, don't you see, my dear?

410
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,520
You give me the formula, I turn my little Naughties blue.

411
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,400
- Blue. - I use their essence

412
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,610
to continue with my wonderful magic show here.

413
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:58,240
That way I never have to bother you or Smurf Village again.

414
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,330
I don't trust you, and I'm not telling you anything.

415
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,000
Well, perhaps you need a little persuasion, eh?

416
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,330
Naughties, attack!

417
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,380
With pleasure.

418
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,500
Attack!

419
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,550
- No, no, no, not each other. - Not me!

420
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,590
I got you...

421
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,930
Hackus!

422
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,640
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

423
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,720
Not the cat, not the...

424
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,730
Deeply, deeply disappointing experiments.

425
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,480
We've got to rescue Smurfette.

426
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,060
What's our plan to bring Smurfette home?

427
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,610
All right, Smurfs, listen up.

428
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,440
I saved enough grotto water from the last blue moon for just such an occasion.

429
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,860
I was able to smurf it into smurfportation crystals.

430
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,030
So you don't need a portal. Very clever, Papa.

431
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,410
Smurf-xactly.

432
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,500
These will take us directly to Master Winslow's mushroom.

433
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,830
Yeah, Patrick and Grace helped us last time we smurfed through the portal.

434
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,790
Precisely! They'll know what to do!

435
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
- Sign me up! - Sign me up.

436
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,960
- At your service, Papa. - Pick me!

437
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,630
- Did someone say, "Baker should go"? - I would rather not.

438
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,720
Me, me, pick me, Papa!

439
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,180
Now, now, Smurfs. I only had water enough for nine crystals.

440
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,560
That's me and three others round trip, plus Smurfette on the way home.

441
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,680
Assuming you can find her, which you won't.

442
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,400
That's not a very smurfy attitude, Grouchy.

443
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,560
Actually, for me, that was pretty good.

444
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,730
I'll need courage, intelligence and strength.

445
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,110
- So Gutsy. - Aye.

446
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,320
- Brainy. - Of course.

447
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,530
- Hefty. - You got it.

448
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,490
- You'll smurf with me. - Yeah, can I...

449
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,830
Yes, Passive-Aggressive Smurf?

450
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,750
I think Brainy is a really excellent choice.

451
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,830
Good luck with that.

452
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,210
You see what he does?

453
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,170
- That's not a compliment. - Go figure.

454
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,590
- Okay, Hefty, take one. - Let's do this.

455
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,760
- Go get her, guys! - Oops!

456
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
Clumsy.

457
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,170
Somebody do something!

458
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,510
Stand back! I know the Smurflich manoeuvre.

459
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
He doesn't look good.

460
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,850
Oh, dear, he's turning blue-er.

461
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,930
Not good.

462
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,890
Somebody get my hammer!

463
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,850
Nice going, Clumsy.

464
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,230
I got it!

465
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,860
Cheerio!

466
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,190
This was supposed to be Hefty!

467
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,690
Sorry! My bad!

468
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,320
I get so puffy when I travel.

469
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,410
Bye.

470
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,240
Well, sometimes, you got to smurf with the changes.

471
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,410
Travel safe, Papa.

472
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,210
And so Papa and his B team...

473
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,750
I'll be in charge while you're gone!

474
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,040
- And so Papa... - Go get Smurfette back!

475
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,880
- Come on! - And bring her home!

476
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,970
I'm glad his throat opened up and his lips are back to normal.

477
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,800
Again, we're so sorry.

478
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,970
If... Hello?

479
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,850
Johnny can breathe again, which makes two of us since both of his parents are lawyers.

480
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,820
Well, that's why they overreacted.

481
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,110
They didn't overreact.

482
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,940
He's dying.

483
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,110
I think it's time for this.

484
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,410
You didn't bring the crown. Don't put the crown on him.

485
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,990
Come on, you used to love this crown.

486
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,450
- No, I didn't. - Yes, you did.

487
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,200
- You wore it everywhere. - I did not.

488
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,370
Never did. Never once.

489
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,580
This is the way you do it... Look.

490
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Do you see what is going on out there?

491
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,800
Yeah, they're bonding.

492
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,090
- Technically, they're spitting. - Come on.

493
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,600
Blue needs to know that family's not just you and me,

494
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,600
and it's really good for him to play with his grandfather.

495
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,180
Good job!

496
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,980
- Oh, yeah. He's a terrific role model. - Come on, Patrick.

497
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,520
Grace, he ruins everything.

498
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,280
He shows up, and he ruins things. That's what he does.

499
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,610
Just like when he first moved into my house.

500
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,910
He sent my parrot away.

501
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,990
Your parrot?

502
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,160
My father's parrot.

503
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,920
When my dad took off, he left Zeus, and I loved that bird.

504
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,840
I was a kid, and Zeus was the only part of my dad I had left.

505
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,050
There you go.

506
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,470
What?

507
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,110
Get Blue. Blue?

508
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,780
Blue?

509
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,240
Blue! Victor!

510
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,170
- Stay there. - Victor, do you have Blue?

511
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,540
Victor! We can't get the door open!

512
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,000
Victor!

513
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,590
- Victor, open the door! - Victor, we can't open the door!

514
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
I can't see! I can't see!

515
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,480
I'm on a dark, lifeless planet that smells like corn dogs!

516
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,520
Oh, the smurfanity.

517
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,280
Sorry, mister. Your face got in the way.

518
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,950
- Is that Clumsy? Smurfs? - Clumsy?

519
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,700
- Help! - Look out, Grouchy

520
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,410
- Clumsy, is that you? - This way!

521
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,960
- I'm blind! - No, you're in a corn dog.

522
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,250
I knew it would end this way!

523
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,590
Where am I?

524
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,630
This place is strange and terrifying

525
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,140
and so handsome.

526
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,970
Hello, you.

527
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,780
Everyone is ok?

528
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,140
No!

529
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,480
We're lost in the dark, and it smells like corn dogs!

530
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
Watch out!

531
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,440
Master Winslow's gotten old.

532
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,230
- Wait, wait, wait. - Blue?

533
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,440
Stop, stop, stop. They're friends.

534
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,610
- Friends? - Yeah.

535
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,650
They're little blue aliens trying to steal our faces.

536
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,450
No, no, they're called Smurfs.

537
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,780
And they are the sweetest little things you ever did see.

538
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,870
Not me.

539
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,000
No, not you, Grouchy.

540
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,200
Papa, Clumsy.

541
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,790
- Patrick! - Master Winslow.

542
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,330
- Hi, Grace. - Smurf, Smurf, Smurf!

543
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,090
- Is that Blue? - He's huge.

544
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,670
I wouldn't want to be the stork that brought that guy.

545
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:53,510
Well, if Blue likes the Smurfs, then Vicster likes the Smurfs.

546
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,640
What a thrill this must be for all of you.

547
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,470
No pictures, please.

548
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
That's Vanity.

549
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,140
Narcissist.

550
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,310
What are you guys doing here?

551
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,810
Smurfette's been taken.

552
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,230
- Wait, what? - Taken? What do you mean "taken"?

553
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,690
Smurf napped by that ghastly Gargamel.

554
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,570
She was off alone because she thought we forgot her birthday.

555
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,110
There was a misunderstanding.

556
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,830
But if we can find him, we'll find her.

557
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,870
Well, that shouldn't be hard. He's a big star now.

558
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,870
- He's in Paris. - I'll call the dog sitter.

559
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,210
You get Blue's passport.

560
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,460
Yes, a rescue mission. I'll come, too.

561
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,710
You need all the help you can get.

562
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,590
Wait a minute, Blue's passport?

563
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,420
We can't just up and go to Paris.

564
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,930
At least, not all of us.

565
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:36,600
Okay, so that's one vote no. Who votes yes?

566
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,850
- Me. - Of course.

567
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,310
Daddy always loses.

568
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,400
Look, this is my Smurfette we're talking about. We have to go.

569
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,650
If we're going to be traveling, let's make sure we do this properly.

570
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,270
La la la la, Sing a happy song.

571
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,930
Okay, here we are. Victor, can you get Blue?

572
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,270
- All right. We're all clear on the plan, right? - Yeah.

573
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,430
We'll head over to Gargamel's show

574
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,100
- and see if Smurfette's there. - Yes.

575
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,110
And I'll go to Gargamel's hotel and see if I can find out what room he's in.

576
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,650
And, Victor, you and Blue can just check into the room here.

577
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,070
- Well, actually, I was thinking... - No. "Actually, I" nothing.

578
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
You and Blue, upstairs.

579
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,610
That's the deal. End of story.

580
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,990
L'Opera House, s'il vous plait.

581
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,660
My French is tres sexy, non?

582
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,710
- Oui, maybe I'll get you a beret. - You cannot handle me in a beret.

583
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,710
- Is that what you think? I can't... - Hey!

584
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,000
Get a shroom.

585
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,590
- Good luck. - You, too.

586
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,920
Okay.

587
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,220
Give him the formula.

588
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,180
Give him the formula.

589
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,680
Give him the formula.

590
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,440
You want to give it to him.

591
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,560
You'll feel better about yourself

592
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,320
if you stop being such an annoying little brat and give him the formula.

593
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,700
Make her stop. It burns.

594
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,040
Hackus tell you everything I know.

595
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,830
Hackus doesn't know anything.

596
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,840
What? What?

597
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,710
"Buffering"? What the...

598
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,470
My public awaits.

599
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,640
Once again I must go astound and confound the merry imbeciles.

600
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,640
What do you mean, I'm out of essence?

601
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,020
We can still do the show, all right.

602
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:51,480
Because we got all the essence we need right here now, don't we?

603
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,030
I'm going to need a little snip.

604
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,820
Oh, no!

605
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,820
Just going to take a little off around the ears.

606
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,910
There.

607
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,240
When my Papa gets here, you're gonna be sorry.

608
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:06,500
Your Papa is not coming because your real Papa is already here.

609
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,960
- Yeah! - Now,

610
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,500
you can either be a good little girl and give me the formula,

611
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,960
or you can spend the rest of your miserable little existence

612
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,300
being harvested inside my new superpowered Smurfalator!

613
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,300
Your call entirely. Really.

614
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,800
Up to you.

615
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,810
Father! Father!

616
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,930
Yes!

617
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,350
Nice work, my dear.

618
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,310
And as for you, nice try.

619
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Yes, Azrael.

620
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,650
You can press the button on the Smurfalator.

621
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,820
Come, come, come!

622
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,410
We'll brew this hair into Smurf essence!

623
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,950
Papa, please hurry.

624
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,910
I'm so scared.

625
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,330
Poor baby's gonna cry.

626
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,920
Hello, pretty lady.

627
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,300
Hackus pretty, too.

628
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,970
- Hi. - Hello.

629
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,430
I was just wondering if you could be so kind as to tell me what room...

630
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,350
What room Monsieur Gargamel is in?

631
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,600
No. Hotel policy.

632
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,280
Just right over there. Thanks.

633
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,950
Here we are, guys, the Paris Opera House.

634
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,780
- Not too shabby. - Gargamel's really come up in the world.

635
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,450
I hope Smurfette's here.

636
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,670
I do love a good musical. Guilty!

637
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,090
- What did he just say? - I have no idea.

638
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,820
Well, wait a minute, wait a minute.

639
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,400
I asked for a shroud of mystery. This is a wisp!

640
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,660
Alakazatmosphere!

641
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,160
Holy smurf!

642
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:12,910
- Where did that come from? - He's never had this much power before.

643
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,970
Well, I am outraged!

644
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,390
Positively outraged.

645
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,390
I'm sorry, who are you?

646
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,100
I am Monsieur Gargamel's manager, Madame Doolittle.

647
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,110
What is this outhouse you call a room?

648
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,360
- The Napoleon Suite? - Napoleon Suite? Yes.

649
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,110
But, Madame, this is the finest room in all the hotel.

650
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,860
What could possibly...

651
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,120
Well, for starters, darling, it's on the wrong floor.

652
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,160
No one wants to be on the...

653
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,960
- The fifth floor. - Yes. Yes, that's much too low.

654
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,300
Good evening! Good evening!

655
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,760
Okay, guys, we're going in.

656
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,620
No, no, no.

657
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,140
Great.

658
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,140
Okay, Papa, sneak out the back of my sweater

659
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,390
while I talk to this man who has no idea what I'm saying

660
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,850
and go find that dressing room.

661
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:19,150
This is a great vacation, guys. I can feel the stress melting right off me.

662
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,320
- Don't spiral, Grouchy. - Yeah. We got this.

663
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,070
- Gentlemen, we have a cat problem. - Get down, get down.

664
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,910
There! No, no, don't be alarmed.

665
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,160
This is how I treat all the critics.

666
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,120
Hurry, up those ropes.

667
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,000
Is Smurfette really worth all this?

668
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,420
- I'm just saying. - Let's go.

669
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,040
- Not permis. Not permis. - What? This is outrageous.

670
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,130
Your families will all pay dearly.

671
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,840
As a result, some of you may die.

672
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,230
No, I'm sorry, you will need your key card.

673
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,070
Yes, of course, darling, my key card!

674
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,200
Oh, dear, I've left it.

675
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:13,200
Oui, I was having breakfast at Tiffany's.

676
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,460
I'll just go back and get it.

677
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,300
I bet my glutes look great climbing up this rope.

678
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,890
Grouchy, take a look.

679
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,010
I hate my life.

680
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,260
- Clumsy! - Move it.

681
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,390
...Interrupt my sorcery, at least I should be amused.

682
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,060
Now, you will all kindly hail to the great and exceedingly powerful Gargamel...

683
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,480
What are you doing out here? How dare you?

684
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,450
You smell something suspicious? Well, of course you do!

685
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,030
I've seen where you put your nose.

686
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,660
Now, get out of here.

687
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,820
Hi, Daddy.

688
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,290
- Blue? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, just listen...

689
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,410
Blue and I decided we can't let you run solo on this.

690
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,540
We can do this together.

691
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,250
Three generations of proud Doyle men standing shoulder to shoulder.

692
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,420
Even though we're all different heights and whatnot.

693
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,760
We are not Doyle men.

694
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,130
Winslow-hyphen-Doyle.

695
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,220
You have a bee in your bonnet about the whole name thing.

696
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,390
Why do you chortle?

697
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,510
Usually, in magic, the cats are big, no?

698
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,770
Like tiger or like lions, you know?

699
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,400
Silence, knave! And allow me to oblige you.

700
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
Alakazanimal!

701
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,200
Try not to smell delicious!

702
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,790
So far, this is the worst trip of my life!

703
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,330
And I've only taken two!

704
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:42,120
- Look! There's Gargamel's dressing room. - Good eye, Vanity.

705
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,210
Please! He's got a star on his door.

706
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,330
Let's go.

707
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,710
Remind me to put a star on my mushroom when we get home.

708
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,720
- If we ever want to be blue... - Blue.

709
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,680
...we've got to come up with some way to get her talking.

710
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,550
- Yeah. - Got any ideas?

711
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,010
I got it! Say "please."

712
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,850
Never mind. I forgot you were you.

713
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,690
- All right, here's my plan. - Okay.

714
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:06,770
We trick her into acting like us, being naughty.

715
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,900
Naughty, naughty!

716
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,280
We use all her goodness against her.

717
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,110
Once that happens, she'll feel like she's part of our family!

718
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,370
Family! I like family!

719
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,910
I love this plan!

720
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,160
- Oh, no! - Broken family!

721
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,620
- Get her! - Catch her! Catch Smurfette!

722
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,580
See you later, Smurfigators!

723
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,420
Father's gonna kill us! Go faster!

724
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,170
- Au revoir, trolls! - Get her!

725
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,220
- Hello? - Smurfette?

726
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,550
- Where are you? - Quick question.

727
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,720
How is it we can't reach a doorknob, but we can get up here?

728
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,010
No, Clumsy, don't! No, no!

729
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,980
You just lost a fight to an empty room.

730
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,070
Nobody wants to come up here

731
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,320
and play with the larger kitty that they so annoyingly asked for!

732
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,450
You have to go! Now!

733
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,570
- Yeah, soon as we get the Smurfette. - Yeah!

734
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,780
- He coughs up everything he eats. - You!

735
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,120
Magic man, hand over the Smurfette.

736
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,790
What did you just say?

737
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,540
You heard me.

738
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,920
Give me the Smurfette! Now!

739
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,630
How dare you? Alaka...

740
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,920
- Duck! - ...duck!

741
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,550
Duck?

742
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,600
That was... up.

743
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,220
No!

744
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,310
You.

745
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,690
By great Merlin's beard, I remember you!

746
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,650
We meet again, eh?

747
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:35,150
Daddy's flying! Daddy's flying!

748
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,830
Well, well, well, it appears we have a volunteer after all!

749
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,040
Enough fooling around, yes? Open wide, Azrael.

750
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,000
Put him down, Gargafella!

751
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,880
Leave my son alone!

752
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,260
I'll teach you to mess with us Doyle ducks!

753
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
You again!

754
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,860
What are you doing? Put me down!

755
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,020
Come on, Blue.

756
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,570
Put me down! I could have taken him! I had him!

757
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,780
I'm afraid that's all the show we have time for.

758
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,450
Good bye.

759
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,910
Go on, get out, get out, get out.

760
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,160
Smurfette's hair. She's been here.

761
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,160
Look! I found something.

762
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,830
A portrait of perfection.

763
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,630
Imagine how good you'd look if you were actually helping.

764
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,630
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

765
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,970
- Smurfette? - Smurfette?

766
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,260
Hey, is that coffee?

767
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,470
Anyone else want a cup o' joe?

768
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,640
Hey, what's that?

769
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,560
It's a mirror, you barbarian.

770
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,440
Snap out of it, Vanity, and push!

771
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,150
Rage before beauty.

772
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,730
Whatever this is, it's making my butt scrunch.

773
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,200
That's a little scary. I mean...

774
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,450
Gargamel!

775
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,700
Clumsy! Are you trying to get us smurfed?

776
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,160
It's some sort of magic window.

777
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,040
Maybe it'll show us where Smurfette is.

778
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
Naughties?

779
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,300
- Gargamel! - Quickly, pick it up.

780
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,880
Quickly, to me, to me!

781
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,340
Smurfette? Hello?

782
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,470
Where did you go? Hello?

783
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,300
- Move, Smurfs. - Here he comes. Hurry.

784
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,140
- Let's go! Let's go! - Where are you? Are you here?

785
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,810
- Children? Smurfette? - Back up, back up.

786
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,600
Close the door! Close the door!

787
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,230
Your papa is back.

788
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,190
Her papa?

789
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,900
If this is a joke, I assure you I don't find it funny.

790
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,610
- Hello? - Hold it!

791
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,530
- Are you down there, you little delinquents? - Keep still.

792
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,620
They must have retreated back to the hotel.

793
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,040
Of course we're running out of time.

794
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,920
If that Patrick person is here, then Papa cannot be far behind.

795
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Quickly, to the hotel! We must get to her before he does.

796
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,930
My face! My face!

797
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,390
- What? - It's gorgeous.

798
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,930
We fell, and it wasn't even my fault!

799
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,140
Anyone? Anyone?

800
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:17,060
Oh, my Smurf.

801
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,950
I'm scrunching again.

802
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,320
Papa, what does this have to do with Smurfette?

803
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,910
Everything, I'm afraid.

804
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:33,120
Why would he build such a hideous device?

805
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,750
Is that a giant Smurfalator?

806
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,670
To extract our essence.

807
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,550
What are all those containers for?

808
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,970
Ninety-nine bottles of Smurf on the wall.

809
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,890
So if Smurfette gives him the formula...

810
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:53,270
He can turn as many Naughties into Smurfs as his greedy heart desires.

811
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,020
Guys?

812
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,710
Total Smurf a geddon.

813
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,530
Oh, dear.

814
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,370
Need a catch, please.

815
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,370
This place really needs to recycle.

816
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,960
Think, Smurfette, think. Oh, no!

817
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,210
- Where's Smurfette? Where's Smurfette? - There she is!

818
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,630
She's fast! I love this game!

819
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:25,300
Wait! Let's let her run for a bit. She's got nowhere to go.

820
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,430
- This is perfect for my plan! - Yeah, yeah.

821
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:30,220
What are you so cross about? I'm the duck!

822
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:33,470
You always barge in and ruin everything! You're like a walking disaster!

823
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,230
Hey, look me in the eyes and say that.

824
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:38,730
- I can't. - That's right, because it's not true.

825
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,520
No, I can't because your eyes are on the sides of your head!

826
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,360
All the better for me to see your disrespect!

827
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,320
- What are you looking at? - Hurry up.

828
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,280
It's global warming. Buy a Prius.

829
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,660
Okay. Did I lose them?

830
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,790
Good dog.

831
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,250
No, no... Sorry. Excuse me.

832
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,670
Okay, I got this.

833
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:19,650
Papa, where are you?

834
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,110
Why am I not surprised the way out of Gargamel's lair is through a sewer?

835
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,780
- Master Winslow. - Papa!

836
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,610
- Patrick, look. - What happened?

837
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,950
Gargamel is hatching a terrible, terrible plan.

838
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,580
What's with the duck?

839
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,830
That's Victor. Gargamel turned him into a duck.

840
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,080
- Now Gargamel knows we're onto him. - I was only trying to help!

841
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,130
Victor, you look fowl.

842
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,040
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

843
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:47,550
Focus, everyone. We've got to find Smurfette quickly.

844
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,390
- There she is! Got her! - Chase over?

845
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,720
Hey, Hackus. See that candy store?

846
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,060
- Candy? Candy! - I've got an idea.

847
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:00,730
Go get yourself in trouble. Be naughty! I'll take care of the rest.

848
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:03,810
I love to make trouble! Naughty, naughty, naughty!

849
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:08,030
Hey, blondie. Where you going?

850
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,570
Leave me alone.

851
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,160
You mean like your so-called Papa has?

852
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,200
No, he hasn't!

853
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:17,160
He will come for me.

854
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:23,040
He won't, because he knows you're where you really belong.

855
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,380
I didn't kidnap you, Smurfette.

856
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,630
I brought you home.

857
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:32,300
I'm gonna make big trouble.

858
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:40,430
Yummy candy!

859
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,570
Here comes trouble!

860
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,280
Hello!

861
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:08,500
Oh, my gosh! He's gonna be killed! We have to help!

862
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,630
I thought you were supposed to be good.

863
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,130
But...

864
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:14,970
Help!

865
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,510
Oh, smurf.

866
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,060
Okay, come on!

867
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,480
Oh, no. I'm really in trouble now.

868
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,940
- Vexy! - Oh, no! Hackus!

869
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,190
Help!

870
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:26,730
Help Hackus.

871
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,530
Smurfette, what are we gonna do?

872
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,070
Vexy, give me a lift! Come on, jump!

873
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:38,240
- Bull's-eye! - Holy smurf!

874
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:41,500
- Good one, Smurfette! - Blend that, candy man!

875
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,790
Come on, Hackus!

876
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,710
Vexy, let's go!

877
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,760
Hold on!

878
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,550
Look out!

879
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,630
Nice move, stealing a cart.

880
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,970
I didn't exactly steal it.

881
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,600
- Sorry! - Well, it's not yours, is it?

882
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,930
Naughty, naughty, naughty.

883
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,100
See? You're just like us.

884
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,860
How am I going to get Smurfette to give me that formula, Azrael?

885
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,110
This whole thing just makes me want to...

886
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,150
Cry? No. Flush her down the toilet bowl.

887
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,820
There must be something we can do.

888
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,620
I know you only have a tiny little pea-sized brain in there, but think!

889
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:24,160
Is it her birthday? Really? Who cares?

890
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:28,250
A present? A cake?

891
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:29,380
Be nice to her?

892
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:37,300
Bribery and flattery to soften her stony little heart, eh?

893
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,430
That's counterintuitive, but that just might work.

894
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,180
I'm so glad I thought of this!

895
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,600
Let's see...

896
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:47,350
All right, all right.

897
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,060
What kind of gift should I get her?

898
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,320
- Kitty, kitty, kitty! - Hey, fish breath!

899
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,530
Not now, Azrael, I'm trying to think of

900
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:58,910
a genuine and heartfelt gift that I can deceive that Smurfette with!

901
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,320
I said not now!

902
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:05,040
Not now! Not now! Not now! Not now! Not now! Not now!

903
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,830
You are walking home.

904
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:10,330
Cats.

905
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,500
Faster! Faster!

906
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:14,590
Excuse us! Sorry!

907
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,170
How are we gonna stop this thing?

908
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,680
I don't think that's gonna be a problem!

909
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,680
And she sticks the landing!

910
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,310
- Yummy pudding! - Hackus, it's mud.

911
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:30,020
Yummy mud!

912
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,230
Take your best shot, cat!

913
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,030
Watch out!

914
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,410
Yes!

915
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,530
- Nice shot! Let's go! - Nice shot! Let's go!

916
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,950
- Come on! - Move it or lose it, Hackus!

917
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,210
Oh, no! Angry kitty! Angry kitty! Run!

918
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,540
Okay, ladies, act pregnant.

919
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:52,830
- This way, guys! - Faster!

920
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,710
- It's time to get your wings! - Faster!

921
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,050
Quick, get on the storks!

922
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,340
Let's go!

923
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,420
Wait, where's Hackus?

924
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,930
Fly, big stork, fly!

925
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,800
Here comes kitty! Look out!

926
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,390
Come on, Hackus! Let's go!

927
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:10,190
Yeah!

928
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:13,020
Hey, look, it's a catfish!

929
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:15,270
Bye, kitty!

930
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:18,490
This is amazing!

931
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:22,160
Stork going backwards! Stork going backwards!

932
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,910
This is so beautiful!

933
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:32,330
I'm falling! I'm falling!

934
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,000
Smurfette's my hero!

935
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,550
- How did it go? - Couldn't have gone better.

936
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:42,260
Except that everything was a complete smurftastrophe.

937
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:44,470
It's Smurfy's Law.

938
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:46,810
Well, I have some good news.

939
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:52,390
I borrowed a waiter's outfit for you, complete with a security card for the elevator.

940
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,600
How did you manage that?

941
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,070
Let's just say that the Plaza Athénée laundry room was paid a little visit

942
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:01,190
by international apparel inspector Mademoiselle Doolittle.

943
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,160
I was like Meryl smurfin' Streep.

944
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:05,740
Good job, Grace!

945
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:08,330
Does everyone get a new outfit, or just Patrick?

946
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,080
- Bloody window. - What was that?

947
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,210
That's Victor.

948
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:15,710
They wouldn't let him through the lobby, so he flew up.

949
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,800
No depth perception.

950
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,800
Grandpa Vicster is a duck!

951
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,300
Gargamel zapped him.

952
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,800
You can change him back, right?

953
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,510
No, but it's a transformation spell.

954
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,140
It'll wear off eventually.

955
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:30,560
Everybody relax. It's not a problem.

956
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,140
But if you see me lay an egg, it's just between us.

957
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,810
You don't seem too upset about this.

958
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,190
It's not in a duck's nature to get upset.

959
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,860
We like to let things roll off our backs.

960
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,240
Seriously? You seriously just said that?

961
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,160
- I like that. That's very smurfy of you. - Very smurfy.

962
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,530
Why, thank you. See?

963
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,740
The little Santa Claus Smurf appreciates me.

964
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:54,710
Maybe someday, Patrick, you'll learn to appreciate my smurfy qualities, too!

965
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,920
Okay. I've... There's... You know...

966
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,880
I'm not having this conversation with a duck.

967
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,420
Now I'm catching a cold.

968
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:03,760
I wish I had a cold.

969
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:06,090
I've had Hefty's crystal shoved down my throat,

970
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:09,010
got attacked as a corn dog, fell down a sewer,

971
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,520
and if that wasn't smelly enough,

972
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,690
had to travel by armpit just to find out we're all gonna be extinct!

973
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,400
- Holy smurf, I'm a downer. - You most certainly are.

974
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:22,700
Grouchy, the only way we'll be extinct

975
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:25,650
is if Smurfette gives Gargamel the secret formula.

976
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,990
- But Smurfette would never tell. - Of course not.

977
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:29,280
- Never. - Absolutely not.

978
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:32,240
Smurfette could never be tricked into being one of them.

979
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,500
Hey, Smurfette.

980
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,040
Did you do this with your sisters back in Smurf Village?

981
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,630
Lots of flying, but I never had a sister.

982
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,380
Well, you do now.

983
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:45,050
- Want to race? - You want to race me?

984
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,720
You're in trouble now!

985
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:51,600
- I'm gonna lose you, Smurfette. - Not a chance.

986
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,150
Watch out!

987
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,820
Hold on tight, Hackus.

988
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,780
- Not that tight, Hackus. - Sorry.

989
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:09,820
Stork fight!

990
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,200
Coming through!

991
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,740
This is insane!

992
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,420
Smurf, smurf, and away.

993
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,420
Hackus, king of world!

994
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:25,510
You're playing dirty now!

995
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,380
I'm just getting started.

996
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:28,970
Go, go!

997
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,050
I call that a Crepe Smurfette.

998
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,810
Snails to go?

999
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:37,980
- Batter up! - Come on!

1000
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,190
Hit me with your best shot.

1001
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:43,820
Snailed her!

1002
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,030
- You are naughty, Smurfette. - Yeah.

1003
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,620
Hey! I've seen that lady before.

1004
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,330
She's beautiful.

1005
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:58,460
They've got one of these everywhere.

1006
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,540
I'm gonna strangle that duck.

1007
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,670
Vic's like a black cloud that follows me around.

1008
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,130
Okay, look, I get it.

1009
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,130
But you know what, he's here, isn't he?

1010
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,550
He shows up.

1011
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,510
Yeah, whether you want him to or not.

1012
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,140
Okay, I always heard that showing up was 90% of the job.

1013
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,390
A lot of fathers don't even do that.

1014
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,310
He's not my father.

1015
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,390
Well, that's too bad.

1016
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,810
'Cause that pretty much leaves you without one.

1017
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,830
- Patrick. - All right, guys.

1018
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,540
- Come on. - Let's do this!

1019
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,750
- I'm gonna stay with Blue. - And Vic.

1020
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,330
Okay, Smurfs, off to Gargamel's hotel.

1021
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,960
Patrick, there's actually something I'd like to...

1022
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,130
No "actuallys."

1023
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,420
You're staying here.

1024
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:48,880
That's not what I was even going...

1025
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,630
Victor, don't make me pluck you.

1026
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,130
- Let's go. - Let's do it.

1027
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:56,100
We're gonna get Smurfette this time, 100% guaranteed.

1028
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,850
What did you just say, Grouchy?

1029
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:03,020
You heard it. I'm tired of being Grouchy. I am changing my tune to a happy one.

1030
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:05,060
From now on, lam...

1031
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,650
Ready? Positive Smurf.

1032
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,900
I sprained my face.

1033
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,450
You'll get used to it. Let's go, Smurfs.

1034
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,780
- Come on. Come on. - A paper bag. First-class.

1035
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,740
- Hurry... - Clumsy!

1036
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,200
Good luck, Daddy!

1037
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,160
Le chat VIP.

1038
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,830
Please, I will take you to your room.

1039
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,800
- Front desk. - Listen well, you slack-jawed knave.

1040
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,970
Monsieur Gargamel.

1041
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:39,810
I want ale, curds and blistered meats sent into my room in 10 minutes,

1042
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,230
or I will turn you into a legless tree sloth.

1043
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:47,020
How was that, Smurfs?

1044
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,940
That's not funny, man.

1045
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:58,700
Duck, duck, duck.

1046
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,700
Goose!

1047
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:07,080
The security card for the elevator. Patrick needs my help.

1048
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:13,510
When I show up with this, he'll see this black cloud has got a silver...

1049
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,550
A silver lining!

1050
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:30,570
Oh, my...

1051
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:32,110
Master Winslow, please.

1052
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:33,740
- You can't get a reservation... - Focus.

1053
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,450
That smells delish!

1054
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,660
Le bingo.

1055
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:47,540
Okay, guys, listen, when you get to the room, if there's any problems...

1056
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:52,300
- Snot on a half shell. Delicacy. - Sorry, Mr Fish!

1057
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,460
You look fried.

1058
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,130
Like I said, if there are any problems...

1059
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,260
My friend, there are no such thing as problems.

1060
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,970
Only smurfitunities.

1061
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,470
- You're freaking me out, Grouchy. - Positive!

1062
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,180
Of...

1063
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,400
Okay, guys, we're in.

1064
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,440
Patrick Winslow-Doyle.

1065
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,110
Patrick.

1066
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,660
- What are you doing here? - Saving your tail feather. Now come here.

1067
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,330
I've got something you need for your mission.

1068
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:24,660
Hurry up. There's no time to argue.

1069
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,870
- What? - It's the security card for the elevator.

1070
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,210
I have the security card.

1071
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:34,670
What is this? This is our room key.

1072
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:39,130
Well, now when you come back, you'll be able to get in.

1073
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,550
- No problem. - I can't...

1074
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:41,970
No, no, no, no, no.

1075
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,260
You're welcome.

1076
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,430
You can thank me later.

1077
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,020
How did you get out?

1078
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,440
Now, you just put me back down.

1079
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,730
Patrick, help!

1080
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,570
- We need you for our duck a l'orange. - You want a piece of me?

1081
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,820
No, no, no, no! That's not what I meant.

1082
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,200
Yeah, it starts with the ducks, and soon, no one's safe!

1083
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,660
- Unbelievable. - Patrick!

1084
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:05,490
Master Winslow?

1085
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,410
- Patrick! - Where'd he go?

1086
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:09,290
- He disappeared. - Now we're on our own.

1087
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:10,790
- Well... - Hide!

1088
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,130
Monsieur Gargamel.

1089
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:22,430
We're smurfed. Plan B, anybody?

1090
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:24,440
I'm struggling to remain positive here.

1091
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,150
Monsieur Gargamel?

1092
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,110
Room service.

1093
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:38,400
Hello, kitty.

1094
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,070
Here is your room service.

1095
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,030
- What do we do? - Smurf him with the element of surprise.

1096
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:46,620
Oh, Clumsy!

1097
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:49,660
- Oh, dear. - Now what do we do?

1098
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,080
Just act scary.

1099
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,540
What?

1100
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:56,090
I'm a scary ghost!

1101
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:57,420
Nice.

1102
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,630
Why do so many bad things happen to little blue people?

1103
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,640
Positive, positive.

1104
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,310
Window! Window! Window!

1105
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,020
Oh, no!

1106
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,190
Are you smurfing kidding me? You nearly killed...

1107
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:19,280
I mean, look at this view.

1108
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:29,660
If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and smells like a corn dog...

1109
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:31,870
All right, which one of you is Vic?

1110
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,790
What, you don't recognise your own father?

1111
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,880
- Let's go. - What about my brothers?

1112
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,800
We can't just leave them here to be eaten.

1113
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,210
You just met them.

1114
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,300
This is my flock. I can't just leave them behind.

1115
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,180
Come on, if you're game, so am I.

1116
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,560
I am covered in filth.

1117
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:55,060
I look like something the cat dragged in!

1118
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:59,900
Come on, it's not that bad.

1119
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,280
Although, if I don't... The cat!

1120
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:05,660
- Not the face. Not the face! - Close the lid!

1121
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,370
- That was awesome! - Thank you!

1122
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:13,000
Hackus lives!

1123
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,330
Vexy, come and help me close the door.

1124
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,080
- Thank you, bird. - Bye.

1125
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,920
That was crazy.

1126
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,920
Bye-bye, birds. I had fun.

1127
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,340
Yeah.

1128
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:25,550
- High fours! - High fours!

1129
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:28,090
Hackus, Hackus, Hackus.

1130
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,350
It's so nice having another girl around.

1131
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:33,930
What are you doing?

1132
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:37,020
Rm just hugging you.

1133
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,900
Haven't you ever been hugged?

1134
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:45,110
Vexy...

1135
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:52,870
- Hackus hug. Hackus hug. - Hackus.

1136
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:54,790
Hackus squeeze!

1137
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,210
Hackus.

1138
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:58,960
I'm positive we should just leave him in here.

1139
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,040
Thanks.

1140
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:04,260
Hurry. They're probably doing something mean and horrible to her right now.

1141
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,760
Yeah, Smurfette needs us. She's probably scared and...

1142
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,350
- I love family! - What...

1143
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,220
What is she doing?

1144
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:15,310
I think they're hugging.

1145
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:16,560
Papa?

1146
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,310
Hackus love to hug.

1147
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:19,770
Hackus.

1148
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:22,400
Smurfette, come on, I got to show you something.

1149
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,150
Look at us. Come on, tell me we're not family.

1150
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,950
Smurfette!

1151
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:32,160
Over here!

1152
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,280
Smurfette!

1153
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:36,410
I'm sorry Papa Smurf didn't come for you.

1154
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:41,000
But maybe your place is here with us.

1155
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,960
Yeah.

1156
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,590
Maybe it is.

1157
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:48,260
Why is she being nice to them?

1158
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:52,100
She's just identifying with her captors. It's classic Smurf-holm syndrome.

1159
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:56,390
No, she thinks we don't care anymore, and they do.

1160
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,770
She's confused.

1161
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,150
Clumsy, Grouchy, get up there, and help me get this door open.

1162
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:02,310
- That's my daughter in there! - Okay, Papa.

1163
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,530
- I'll get on top. - Okay, Grouchy, you jump, I'll pull.

1164
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:08,070
- Come on, we can do this. - Children.

1165
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,280
- Gargamel! - Clumsy, don't let go...

1166
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:13,200
Daddy's home.

1167
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:18,250
And consistent with his kind nature, he brought you a present.

1168
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:19,580
Grouchy, get down. He'll see you.

1169
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,960
- How are we gonna rescue her now? - Quiet.

1170
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,750
I do believe we got off on the wrong foot earlier.

1171
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,880
What's happening?

1172
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,720
Would you allow me to wish you a very, very happy birthday?

1173
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:32,260
It seems like only yesterday

1174
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:36,600
you were just my little glob of clay and other putrid ingredients.

1175
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:40,390
You remembered my birthday?

1176
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,900
Of course I did. We're family.

1177
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,480
- What? - But we're her family.

1178
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,360
- Families don't forget things like that. - Does she think we abandoned her?

1179
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:51,070
Speaking of which, your little blue step-papa never did arrive, now did he?

1180
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:52,490
Step-Papa?

1181
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:55,990
Why, I am truly sorry, my dear. That must really sting.

1182
00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:01,620
I remember when my father threw me down the well for the first time.

1183
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,920
The disappointed look on his face

1184
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:07,960
when I finally managed to claw my way out.

1185
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:12,130
Anyway, happy birthday, my dear.

1186
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:13,890
- Happy birthday, Smurfette! - Happy birthday, Smurfette!

1187
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,470
- I want to open! Let me open! - No, no, no.

1188
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,850
Ugly.

1189
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:25,520
"Bow. Kneel. Worship me."

1190
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:30,530
Yes, delightful rendition, really.

1191
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:32,780
Keep it up, no-neck, I'll turn you into a cross-eyed newt.

1192
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,950
Yes, yes, my dear.

1193
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,530
Go ahead, take it.

1194
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,870
It's a tiny little magical wand of your very own.

1195
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,880
Go ahead. It's your birthday present.

1196
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:51,880
No.

1197
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,510
Don't do it.

1198
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,600
Do you like it?

1199
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:02,270
Silly me. I've forgotten to turn it on.

1200
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:05,100
Here we are.

1201
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:09,020
Yes, there we go.

1202
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,740
Yes, go ahead, try it out. Don't be afraid.

1203
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:17,950
- A Dragon Wand. - Oh, dear.

1204
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,080
After all, it is your birthright.

1205
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,370
How do you know I won't use it on you?

1206
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:26,580
Well...

1207
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:31,090
Because, Smurfette, I am your father.

1208
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:34,300
Search your feelings. You know it to be true.

1209
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:37,010
- She's gonna zap him. - Get him, Smurfette.

1210
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,510
Smurfette...

1211
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:40,510
Sing The La La Song.

1212
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:46,770
Sing it!

1213
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,230
This is good, right, Papa?

1214
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,820
No! She's becoming one of them!

1215
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:57,570
I have always wanted to do this!

1216
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,330
We're losing her.

1217
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:05,830
- Yes! Good one, Smurfette. - Your first cat zap.

1218
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:08,500
Look at you. Look at you.

1219
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:14,300
You truly are daddy's little girl.

1220
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,760
- Smurfette! - No, Papa! Grouchy, grab him!

1221
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:18,550
- No, Papa, he's gonna see you! - Get him down!

1222
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,340
- Clumsy, help, help me get him down! - Papa, no!

1223
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,680
Yeah!

1224
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,650
No!

1225
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:37,740
Take to the skies, lads. Free at last! Free at last!

1226
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:40,320
- What are you, Martin Luther Wing? - That's it.

1227
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:45,040
Joke it up, funny boy, but I am proud as a peacock to be a freedom flighter.

1228
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:46,700
Oh, no.

1229
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:48,660
What the... is that?

1230
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:52,840
Hang on, Smurfs! Victor's on the way!

1231
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,880
Pop your smurf-chutes.

1232
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,210
The flying V!

1233
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:58,260
Gotcha.

1234
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:00,260
Okay, don't panic.

1235
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:02,350
That is a lot of white meat.

1236
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:04,560
Now panic!

1237
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:06,390
Me no likey!

1238
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:13,270
That was brilliant.

1239
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,860
- He's naked, right? - Everyone okay?

1240
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:19,070
Help me, somebody. Somebody please, let me out!

1241
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:24,580
I have seen unspeakable things down there.

1242
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,660
I have been scarred for life.

1243
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:31,040
Where's Smurfette?

1244
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,000
- She's... - Where's Smurfette?

1245
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:38,760
We were too late.

1246
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,050
Nice going.

1247
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:49,770
Have fun, children. Just remember, be kind to each other.

1248
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:52,060
Will you get away from me, you bumbling moron?

1249
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,810
- Where are they? - What?

1250
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,730
Smurfs were here? In this room? Why didn't you say so?

1251
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,480
Right now!

1252
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:01,570
She must not learn of this.

1253
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:06,910
We must spirit her away from here and get that formula now.

1254
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:10,410
Smurfette, my dear, are you ready to go celebrate?

1255
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,160
- Yeah! - Come on, come on. This'll be fun.

1256
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:15,420
We were this close to getting Smurfette back.

1257
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,500
I know.

1258
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:19,380
He distracted me at the worst possible moment, Grace.

1259
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,260
I would have been in the elevator if it wasn't for him.

1260
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:24,090
Okay, okay, use your indoor voice, and please, Patrick, just breathe.

1261
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:25,850
I want him gone.

1262
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:28,720
- He's your dad. - No, that's one thing he is not.

1263
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:31,100
He's right, Grace. I'm not his father.

1264
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,650
His real father left and started a new family.

1265
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:37,400
He's been chewed up about it ever since.

1266
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:40,150
- Excuse me? - As well you might.

1267
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,820
But I can't take the brunt of it anymore.

1268
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:47,530
Hey, I never asked for you to come barging into my life, okay?

1269
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:51,540
I didn't ask you to marry my mother or take away Zeus.

1270
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:54,080
Zeus? The pigeon?

1271
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,250
The parrot.

1272
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:57,920
My parrot.

1273
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,090
Taken away because you were allergic.

1274
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,140
I was not allergic to that bird, Patrick.

1275
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:07,470
Yes, you were.

1276
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,510
No, I wasn't.

1277
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,640
You were.

1278
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:13,640
What?

1279
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:17,020
It got so bad, every day, you were wheezing, coughing.

1280
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,570
Your mother and I both knew that it would break your heart

1281
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:22,190
to think the bird had to go away because of you.

1282
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:24,740
You already blamed yourself for your dad.

1283
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,070
So I took the heat.

1284
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:30,490
That's a lie. What are you... I'm not allergic to birds.

1285
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,910
Okay, tell you what.

1286
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,500
Sniff my feathers.

1287
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:37,210
- I'm not going to... - Come on, sniff them.

1288
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,010
Truth itches, doesn't it?

1289
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:51,970
Listen to me, Patrick.

1290
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,350
I loved your mother with all my heart.

1291
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,810
I took care of Jeannette, and I made her happy.

1292
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,770
I also chose to love you as my own.

1293
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,360
Now, I didn't have to do that.

1294
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:07,740
But you were this little kid, no father, no hope in his eyes, a big hole in his heart,

1295
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:09,370
so I gave you everything I could.

1296
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,910
But I'm done, you know?

1297
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:14,500
You don't want it, that's fine.

1298
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
My last word of advice to you is this...

1299
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,170
Will you grow up?

1300
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:22,710
Stop blaming everyone else for your pain.

1301
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,000
And whatever you do,

1302
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:27,720
don't teach that beautiful son of yours that love is conditional,

1303
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,680
because it is not.

1304
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:33,390
Good bye, Grace.

1305
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:40,060
Bye-bye, Blue.

1306
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,320
Grandpa Vicster.

1307
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,160
Bye.

1308
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:01,540
Goodbye, Patrick Winslow.

1309
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,430
Look at that big wheel.

1310
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:17,310
Come. Come along, my dear.

1311
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,690
So this is why they call it the City of Light.

1312
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:23,400
There's a lot of people.

1313
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:25,520
Yes, well...

1314
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:28,860
I prefer to call them "worshippers."

1315
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:30,360
"Worshippers."

1316
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,950
Alakakneel!

1317
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,120
Bow. Kneel.

1318
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,410
Hackus.

1319
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,540
- Shall we? - Let's go.

1320
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:45,960
Don't worry. Everyone likes it. He's a celebrity. Come on.

1321
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:47,300
Okay.

1322
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,760
Yes, hello. It's me.

1323
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,430
- These are my children. - Hi.

1324
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:54,090
- Who's that? - That's my brother.

1325
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,260
Hi. I'm Hackus.

1326
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,930
Look at that. It's a magical creature.

1327
01:07:58,310 --> 01:07:59,770
Hi.

1328
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:01,190
It's my birthday.

1329
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:02,810
Thank you.

1330
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:05,110
- I have a FASTPASS. - Yeah, FASTPASS.

1331
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:07,610
Monsieur Gargamel!

1332
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,490
Thank you for keeping our seats warm. Goodbye.

1333
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:11,650
Bye-bye!

1334
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:14,820
Come along, children. Right this way.

1335
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:17,990
Monsieur Gargamel! Monsieur Gargamel!

1336
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,910
Let's go!

1337
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,250
- Father. - Not now.

1338
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:23,750
It's feeding time soon.

1339
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:25,750
- Not now! - But...

1340
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,000
Here we are.

1341
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:33,760
- Our fun is just beginning, eh? - Yeah.

1342
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:37,140
Alakazelevate!

1343
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:45,560
But isn't this lovely, my dear?

1344
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:47,820
And just think,

1345
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:52,280
with your secret formula and my incredible magic,

1346
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:56,370
there's absolutely nothing that we cannot do.

1347
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,280
Yeah.

1348
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:02,500
Think of all the fun we could have, Smurfette.

1349
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,250
Okay.

1350
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:12,800
Then why are we going so slow?

1351
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,820
- Look out! - Yeah!

1352
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,490
Isn't this fun?

1353
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:38,160
Decidedly not!

1354
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:52,250
Best ride ever! Smurfette's fun, huh?

1355
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,470
Incoming!

1356
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:03,270
Look out! Coming through!

1357
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,730
Sorry!

1358
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:26,120
I must have failed her.

1359
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:30,790
Sorry. I was looking for a place to think.

1360
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,550
No, no, no, no. It's okay.

1361
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:36,300
I was doing a little thinking myself.

1362
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:42,930
Master Winslow, it's hard for me,

1363
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:46,430
but, well, can I ask you some advice?

1364
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,480
I mean, papa to Papa.

1365
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,310
It's about Smurfette.

1366
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,820
I don't know what to do.

1367
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:56,110
I turned her blue.

1368
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:58,990
I taught her love and kindness.

1369
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:01,990
But the truth is, Gargamel made her.

1370
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:06,120
She's only a Smurf as long as she chooses to be.

1371
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,540
But what if she doesn't?

1372
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:12,420
What if she chooses him?

1373
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,670
We could lose her.

1374
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,670
We may have already.

1375
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:20,300
I haven't done enough.

1376
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,760
Are you kidding?

1377
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:24,300
Gargamel just made her, but you,

1378
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,760
you made her what she is.

1379
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:28,730
You stepped in and loved her as your very own.

1380
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:31,020
No one asked you to, you just did.

1381
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:33,610
Because you knew she needed that.

1382
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,820
And that's a...

1383
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,910
That's a pretty special kind of love.

1384
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:46,700
She's way too smart not to see that.

1385
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:50,960
You're right.

1386
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,710
We didn't believe in her because she changed.

1387
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:56,170
She changed because we believed in her.

1388
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,630
Thank you, Master Winslow.

1389
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,050
That was exactly what I needed to hear.

1390
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:13,400
Me, too.

1391
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:17,270
Just a few more bubbles.

1392
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,900
How's that?

1393
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:22,240
Sweet Smurf in Heaven, what have you eaten?

1394
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,740
It's okay. Every time a Smurf toots, someone smiles.

1395
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:27,990
- Let's go, Smurfs. - Where?

1396
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,240
We're getting Smurfette.

1397
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:31,160
But you saw her, Papa.

1398
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:33,170
She's one of them now.

1399
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:35,000
- A horse whisperer? - No!

1400
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,040
- A French Socialist? - No!

1401
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:38,250
A Flying Wallenda!

1402
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,130
No, she's with Gargamel. Keep up.

1403
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:42,010
I don't care what we saw.

1404
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:44,430
You never give up on family.

1405
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:46,430
Yeah, Papa's right.

1406
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:48,810
Who are you, and what have you done with Grouchy?

1407
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:51,020
Hey, I'm Positive, remember?

1408
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,140
All right, Smurfs. Let's get smurfing.

1409
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,270
Master Winslow, you coming with us?

1410
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,940
Is a Smurf's butt blue?

1411
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:02,440
You tell me.

1412
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,030
Grouchy.

1413
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,030
- Put it away. - Anybody else?

1414
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:09,740
Okay, then. Out of the tub with you.

1415
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:10,910
- We've got work to do. - Hey.

1416
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:13,120
Let's smurf this mushroom stand. Let's roll.

1417
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:15,370
Yeah, guys, let's do this.

1418
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:25,430
Victor? Hey.

1419
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,040
Okay, Master Winslow, we'll split up here.

1420
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:58,290
All right. I'll find the electrical room and cut the power.

1421
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,500
And we'll find Smurfette.

1422
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,670
And we'll all look fabulous doing it.

1423
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:03,340
Oh, come on.

1424
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:05,380
Team building. Hello!

1425
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:08,010
All right, see you inside. Good luck.

1426
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:10,010
- Come on, guys. - lnto the belly of the beast.

1427
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:14,640
Why are we coming down here, Father?

1428
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:18,690
Well, we are celebrating your long-lost sister's birthday.

1429
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:19,770
Really?

1430
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,270
Can't very well end the festivities without

1431
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,190
a cake.

1432
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,700
I made you your favourite, my dear. Blue velvet.

1433
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:32,490
Cake.

1434
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:36,620
Go ahead. Go ahead. Make a wish, my dear.

1435
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:41,250
Anything your tiny little heart can dream of, and it is yours.

1436
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,050
Anything?

1437
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:44,420
But of course.

1438
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:46,880
Yes, well, within reason.

1439
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:51,220
I'm afraid we're on a bit of an essence budget around here lately.

1440
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:54,720
That's why we need the formula, you see.

1441
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,230
There she is.

1442
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,280
Is that a birthday cake?

1443
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,240
We had a birthday cake for her, too.

1444
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,820
She just never saw it.

1445
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:12,870
They look like a happy family.

1446
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:15,290
She's not going to give him the formula, is she, Papa?

1447
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:18,960
If she does, it would mean the end of all Smurf kind.

1448
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,670
Wait. Even the handsome ones?

1449
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:24,750
- Yeah. - Vanity, you come with me.

1450
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,090
Clumsy and Grouchy, go meet Master Winslow.

1451
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:40,190
Victor, what are you doing here?

1452
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:41,390
Grace called me.

1453
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,610
She said you might need a hand.

1454
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,320
No, no. Victor, wait.

1455
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,910
As usual, Grace is right.

1456
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:53,910
I could use some help.

1457
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:57,660
Well, for starters, you might try lifting the sewer cover.

1458
01:15:57,740 --> 01:15:59,160
Unless you're planning on fixing the phone lines?

1459
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,960
Smurfette, the formula?

1460
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:08,920
Take all the time you need, my dear.

1461
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:10,720
As long as it's very, very soon.

1462
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,720
Then we can all be blue. Together.

1463
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,100
Hackus blue. Hackus blue.

1464
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,220
You see? They want to be blue,

1465
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,480
just like their big sister.

1466
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:24,650
Then we could be a real family.

1467
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:30,990
This is something.

1468
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:35,370
A sacred gift entrusted to me.

1469
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:39,830
I'm sorry.

1470
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,710
I just, I...

1471
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:45,500
I can't.

1472
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:50,920
What do you mean, you can't?

1473
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:52,340
I've given you everything.

1474
01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:54,550
Kindness, presents,

1475
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,760
a cake with no poison. It's been horrible!

1476
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:00,560
Now, I have had just about enough of this, young lady.

1477
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,440
You are going to give me what I want right now!

1478
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,850
- The formula! - No!

1479
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:05,940
Yes!

1480
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:07,360
- Father? - What, what, what?

1481
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:12,320
Hackus dizzy.

1482
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,990
What's happening to them?

1483
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:15,410
So dizzy.

1484
01:17:15,490 --> 01:17:18,950
Don't tell me you actually care for these pathetic creatures.

1485
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:20,290
How sad for you.

1486
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:26,210
And how absolutely perfect for me.

1487
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:27,960
It looks like the power lines run this way.

1488
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,790
Let's go! Let's go! We got to get her out of there!

1489
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,340
All right, let's do this!

1490
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,630
This way, Vanity. Through this pipe.

1491
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,970
We have to save her! This could be my moment!

1492
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:42,810
I'm so sorry, my dear. I thought you knew.

1493
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:46,230
Without essence, they cannot live.

1494
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,770
- Father. - No.

1495
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:50,110
Please.

1496
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:51,820
No. Vexy.

1497
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,490
So dizzy.

1498
01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:00,280
- Hackus. - Smurfette.

1499
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:02,910
Give them what you have! Take some from me.

1500
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,040
Take some!

1501
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,120
Please!

1502
01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:08,750
What's the point? You won't give me the formula,

1503
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:12,670
so, well, I might as well just let them go.

1504
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:14,130
Vexy.

1505
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:18,260
You mean you'd let them die?

1506
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:21,260
I can always make others.

1507
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:25,180
Besides, I am not the one letting them die.

1508
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,690
You are.

1509
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:31,060
Okay. Okay.

1510
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,360
I'll give it to you. Just feed them.

1511
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:37,450
The formula first.

1512
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:40,280
Feed them. Feed them!

1513
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:41,910
Quickly. We have to get in there.

1514
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:44,120
- Dead end! - It's locked!

1515
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:49,120
The formu-la-la-la-la-la-la.

1516
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:53,130
One hopeful thought.

1517
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:56,420
A dab of royal jelly.

1518
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,130
Mimosa pollen.

1519
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,260
Smurfette.

1520
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:02,600
- Smurfette! - Yes, good girl.

1521
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,720
I can hear them, but I can't see them.

1522
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:06,930
Wait! I know.

1523
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:08,060
Papa, look.

1524
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:09,690
- And a drop of mink oil. - I knew it.

1525
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:12,060
Is she giving him the formula?

1526
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:13,520
- Oh, no. - Smurfette.

1527
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:14,650
Help me get this open.

1528
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:17,780
And you must say one loving truth.

1529
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,160
- Of course. - There.

1530
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,410
That's the formula Papa used.

1531
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:24,160
Now, feed them! Please!

1532
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,330
First, we'll see if this works, huh?

1533
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:28,540
Hurry!

1534
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:30,750
- Come on. - Here we are.

1535
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:32,170
Let's go! Let's go!

1536
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,460
Pull, Patrick. Put your back into it.

1537
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:38,130
- Come on! - Hey, there's an opening down here.

1538
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,880
- Come on, Positive. - Yeah, let's shut 'em down.

1539
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:43,600
One loving truth.

1540
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,350
I hope this works.

1541
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,520
Hackus.

1542
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:35,730
- Smurfette. Thank you. - Vexy!

1543
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:39,070
Oh, my Smurf, it worked.

1544
01:20:39,230 --> 01:20:40,570
- Hackus! - Hackus blue!

1545
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:42,570
Hackus.

1546
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:44,410
Hackus is blue!

1547
01:20:44,530 --> 01:20:46,990
We're blue! We're Smurfs!

1548
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,330
It worked. All the world is mine!

1549
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:52,410
- I can make my own Smurfs! - No!

1550
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,580
We've been betrayed.

1551
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:59,300
Finally, finally.

1552
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:01,260
You're a real boy.

1553
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:02,420
I'm blue.

1554
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:04,430
Now into the machine with all of you.

1555
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:05,680
Father, no.

1556
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:10,600
- No cage for Hackus. No cage for Hackus. - All right, all right.

1557
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:13,100
- In you go. - No cage for Hackus!

1558
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:15,270
- Everybody gets their own room. - Please!

1559
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:18,730
- I failed her, Vanity. - Papa, wait.

1560
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,320
I think I can reach that pin.

1561
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,900
Good idea, Vanity.

1562
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:24,360
Come on, come on.

1563
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,660
Father, please.

1564
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:28,240
Now, don't go anywhere.

1565
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:33,790
You face leaking.

1566
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,290
Hackus leaking.

1567
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:41,210
Hackus leaking.

1568
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:46,090
You sacrificed everything just to save us.

1569
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,140
I had to.

1570
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,890
I care about you.

1571
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:53,520
We're family.

1572
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,900
No like leaking.

1573
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:58,730
Hackus like blue.

1574
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:01,070
What a sickening scene.

1575
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:03,820
I'd be completely nauseated if this weren't

1576
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:06,910
the happiest moment of my life!

1577
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:09,070
- Try the lever, the big one. - Get on my shoulders.

1578
01:22:09,370 --> 01:22:10,830
Hurry, lads.

1579
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:11,950
Which way do I go?

1580
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,950
Try negative. That might shut it off.

1581
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,870
Negative? Nah. I'm all about positive.

1582
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:21,210
There.

1583
01:22:21,290 --> 01:22:25,260
One small step for a wizard,

1584
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:28,340
one giant leap for... What?

1585
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:30,680
Positive!

1586
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:33,310
Too much smurf berry cobbler.

1587
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,600
Grouchy!

1588
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:37,770
Yes, I said you could press the button, didn't I?

1589
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:42,110
Grouchy!

1590
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:44,360
I lied. One giant leap for me!

1591
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,740
Just got fried.

1592
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:53,200
Hard to put a positive spin on that.

1593
01:22:58,370 --> 01:22:59,540
Son of a Smurf!

1594
01:22:59,710 --> 01:23:00,710
Hurry, Vanity.

1595
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:04,050
Narcissism is about to save the day.

1596
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:05,670
- Got it! - Smurftastic work.

1597
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,010
- I knew it. - Now go.

1598
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:08,550
- What? - Go!

1599
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,930
Come, Azrael!

1600
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:14,310
Apparently, we must harness the power of the skies one final time.

1601
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:15,810
Why does this have to be so Les Misérables?

1602
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:18,430
- Let's go. - Look at me, all rough-and-tumble.

1603
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,480
I'm like Commando Smurf.

1604
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,770
Hooah!

1605
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:25,360
You are right. Commandos are quiet and stealthy.

1606
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:26,940
Hooah!

1607
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:28,490
- There she is! - Smurfette.

1608
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:30,820
Santa!

1609
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:34,280
Papa? You... You came for me.

1610
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:37,700
Well, of course we came for you. You're my daughter.

1611
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:39,580
Was there ever a question?

1612
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:41,370
- No, it's locked. - Go on through.

1613
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:42,670
- We'll find another way. - Okay.

1614
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:45,210
We'll see you in there, Master Winslow. Hurry!

1615
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:49,880
Here.

1616
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:51,840
Hold this!

1617
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:09,860
Papa.

1618
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:12,110
Oh, my dear.

1619
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:16,450
Papa, I gave Gargamel the formula.

1620
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,200
But she saved our lives.

1621
01:24:18,370 --> 01:24:20,830
Hackus live! Hackus live!

1622
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:23,790
Papa, I let you down.

1623
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:27,050
I betrayed the Smurfs.

1624
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:28,630
I'm so sorry.

1625
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,720
Smurfette, life is the most precious thing to protect.

1626
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,890
I'm very proud of you.

1627
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:37,930
You... You are?

1628
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:41,020
Seriously? No spanking? No smack to the knuckles?

1629
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,140
You forgive her, just like that?

1630
01:24:43,390 --> 01:24:46,730
Of course. We rise to the amount of love we're shown,

1631
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:50,110
and we sink only when that love stops.

1632
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:53,860
Hackus leaking again. Leaking again!

1633
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,660
Hey, you found Smurfette!

1634
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,530
Hello.

1635
01:24:58,580 --> 01:24:59,620
Hi.

1636
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:02,750
Oh, no, we don't have much time.

1637
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,210
Let's just get the formula back and get out of here. Hooah!

1638
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:07,920
Wait! What about them?

1639
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:10,050
What about them? They kidnapped you.

1640
01:25:10,130 --> 01:25:11,420
Yeah, they're Gargamel's.

1641
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:16,050
So was I, but Papa never gave up on me.

1642
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:18,510
So I'm not about to give up on them.

1643
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:21,470
And you thought you weren't a real Smurf.

1644
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:24,350
- Get them out, quickly. - Right, Papa.

1645
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,020
Free Hackus!

1646
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:28,610
And then there were seven, eh?

1647
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:31,150
Hello, kitty.

1648
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,860
Welcome to the party, Papa!

1649
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,820
Look at all this essence.

1650
01:25:40,490 --> 01:25:43,620
I love your work. Really, all of you.

1651
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:46,540
In particular, your Blue Period.

1652
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:50,040
My whole body is scrunching!

1653
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:52,460
That's enough, Gargamel.

1654
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:53,970
You have enough.

1655
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:58,800
Yes, yes, but you see, Papa, I want more than enough!

1656
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:05,060
After all, I have to be able to power this!

1657
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:10,150
I call her La Wanda.

1658
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:13,530
You get it? Because it's a wand.

1659
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:15,400
So I called it La... It's very funny.

1660
01:26:15,490 --> 01:26:19,320
If you weren't in excruciating pain, you'd be laughing hysterically, believe me.

1661
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:27,460
Whatever will I do with all of this power?

1662
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,590
That's right.

1663
01:26:30,670 --> 01:26:34,010
I'm going to rule the entire world!

1664
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:35,590
No.

1665
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:37,510
And, Papa,

1666
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:40,470
I want you to know that as my first official act,

1667
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:42,370
I'm going to create a portal

1668
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:47,310
all the way from Smurf Village right here to my Smurfalator,

1669
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:51,730
so you get to be with all of your little smurfy friends.

1670
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:55,360
Forever!

1671
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:56,570
I don't think so, Gargamel.

1672
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:01,820
Hit it again.

1673
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:03,120
- Give it to me. - Hurry.

1674
01:27:04,370 --> 01:27:06,200
Hurry, he's going for his wand.

1675
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,920
- Just break it already! - I'm too beautiful to die!

1676
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:13,840
For the love of Smurf, use the pointy end!

1677
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,090
Don't just stand there yelling at me! Attack!

1678
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:18,340
Yes!

1679
01:27:25,010 --> 01:27:26,310
Alaka...

1680
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:15,770
Hackus real boy.

1681
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,360
Thrown to the curb again.

1682
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:20,190
Careful, Clumsy!

1683
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,990
- Every time! - Sorry.

1684
01:28:22,150 --> 01:28:23,200
Really?

1685
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,450
High fours!

1686
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:36,500
Is everyone all right?

1687
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:38,750
All smurfy and accounted for.

1688
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:41,090
- Patrick! - Daddy!

1689
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:42,760
- Hey. - Hey, Grace!

1690
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,220
Hey.

1691
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:46,470
We did it!

1692
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:48,100
Oh, Grace!

1693
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:49,270
Smurfette.

1694
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:50,560
I've missed you.

1695
01:28:51,310 --> 01:28:53,060
I was so worried about you.

1696
01:28:53,230 --> 01:28:56,310
Grace, this is Vexy, my other sister.

1697
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,780
Well, I guess that makes you my sister, too.

1698
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:03,070
Are you okay?

1699
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:07,870
Is this what happy feels like?

1700
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:11,000
Hello, pretty lady! I'm pretty, too!

1701
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,620
And this is Hackus, my brother.

1702
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:14,750
Hackus!

1703
01:29:14,870 --> 01:29:16,750
Hackus, this is Grace and Patrick.

1704
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:19,460
- Hello! - And... Your baby?

1705
01:29:19,630 --> 01:29:20,920
This is Blue.

1706
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:22,970
You did good, Grace.

1707
01:29:23,050 --> 01:29:24,840
He's blue-tiful.

1708
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:26,970
Who this? Who this?

1709
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:28,550
That's Victor.

1710
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:29,760
He's...

1711
01:29:29,890 --> 01:29:30,890
He's my dad.

1712
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:34,730
And Blue's pretty fantastic grandpa.

1713
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:42,280
Daddy and Vicster!

1714
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,490
Okay. I got it.

1715
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,280
I'm really proud of you, Patrick Winslow.

1716
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:50,700
Hyphen-Doyle.

1717
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:52,870
Hyphen-Smurf.

1718
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:56,120
Yeah, guys! Smurf pound.

1719
01:29:56,210 --> 01:29:58,750
- Vanity? - Great job! Great job!

1720
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:00,540
- Positive? - Hey, get that thing out of here!

1721
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:01,920
I'm not pounding anything!

1722
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,340
I'm Grouchy, and I got a lot of pent-up anger to vent!

1723
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,590
Wow, that feels good.

1724
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,840
I'm back!

1725
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:10,930
And so am I!

1726
01:30:11,470 --> 01:30:12,560
Perfect.

1727
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,350
I think most of you know La Wanda...

1728
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:17,730
- Unfortunately. - ...which is a hilarious play on words.

1729
01:30:18,730 --> 01:30:22,570
- Smurfette. - Say hello to my enormous friend!

1730
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:25,280
I don't think so, Gargamel!

1731
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:30,830
Yeah!

1732
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:34,620
Wanda! No, La Wanda, no!

1733
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:37,500
Where is the "off" button on this thing?

1734
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:46,840
No, no, no, no.

1735
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:48,720
No...

1736
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:56,140
No, La Wanda! No means no!

1737
01:31:13,030 --> 01:31:15,490
This is really, really gonna hurt.

1738
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:24,800
- Bravo, Smurfette! Bravo! - Good job, Smurfette!

1739
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,300
That was amazing!

1740
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:28,220
Well, that takes care of Gargamel.

1741
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:30,130
Let's go home, everybody!

1742
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:31,340
- Yeah! - Home!

1743
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:33,970
We still have one small problem.

1744
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:35,810
I've only got five crystals.

1745
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:39,560
Well, I say no Smurf left behind.

1746
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:42,690
Wow, Smurfette.

1747
01:31:42,770 --> 01:31:45,230
You are pretty good with that wand.

1748
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:47,650
It's kind of in my blood.

1749
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:49,740
Which used to concern me.

1750
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,740
But as someone wonderful once told me,

1751
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:55,160
it doesn't matter where you came from.

1752
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:59,080
What matters is who you choose to be.

1753
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:01,170
That's my girl.

1754
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:03,420
And you're our papa.

1755
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:06,500
Thanks for giving us a new home.

1756
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:08,920
And a new family.

1757
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:10,550
You're a good Smurf, Papa.

1758
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:12,930
You'll be a good one, too.

1759
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:14,600
I'm gonna miss you, Smurfs.

1760
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,220
Maybe you can name a corn dog after them.

1761
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:18,970
Now you're talking. We could use blue corn.

1762
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:20,640
Smurf dogs, yum!

1763
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:22,440
Yes!

1764
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:23,850
Well, safe travels, guys.

1765
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,360
And smurf back soon.

1766
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:28,480
Thank you once again, Master Winslow.

1767
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:32,700
Miss Doolittle.

1768
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:35,200
Little Blue.

1769
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:36,950
Papa Vicster.

1770
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:40,410
- Goodbye, Winslow family. - Goodbye, Papa.

1771
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,160
- Bye-bye! - Toodles!

1772
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:45,040
- Well, let's go, Smurfs. - Bye-bye, Winslows.

1773
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:48,670
I can't wait to see the rest of my family.

1774
01:32:51,630 --> 01:32:53,630
Bye, Smurfs!

1775
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:05,940
- Hey, personal space. - Sorry.

1776
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:07,400
Papa, you got Smurfette!

1777
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:09,020
Welcome home, Smurfette!

1778
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:11,650
- Well, looky here! - Yeah, we're back!

1779
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:13,570
- Hi, guys! - This is good.

1780
01:33:13,650 --> 01:33:15,820
And some new Smurfs for our family.

1781
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:17,870
Everyone, this is Vexy.

1782
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:20,700
- Great goobaloo! - She's a sassy lassie.

1783
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:21,830
Hi.

1784
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,580
- Hi... - Hi, I'm Greedy.

1785
01:33:23,660 --> 01:33:26,750
Hi, I'm Greedy. You want to share a cupcake?

1786
01:33:30,090 --> 01:33:31,590
- Crikey! - What the hey?

1787
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:32,880
I nearly smurfed myself.

1788
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:34,340
Hackus.

1789
01:33:34,430 --> 01:33:36,510
Hackus, these are your new brothers.

1790
01:33:37,010 --> 01:33:38,680
I have new brothers!

1791
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:40,560
Squeeze!

1792
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:41,930
Hold on a minute.

1793
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:43,270
Technically speaking,

1794
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:46,100
according to section six of the Smurf Code of Genealogical Legitimacy...

1795
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:47,730
Hey. Just give him a punt.

1796
01:33:47,810 --> 01:33:49,690
- This creature cannot... - Hackus punt!

1797
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,900
- Yeah! - That kid's got style.

1798
01:33:51,980 --> 01:33:53,030
He's one of us.

1799
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:58,030
And so, after waiting patiently to be relevant again,

1800
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:02,370
our heroic Narrator steps back into his leading role

1801
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:04,250
to point out that when last we met,

1802
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:07,370
the entire village was busying itself with preparations for...

1803
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:09,290
Hey, what's with all the decorations?

1804
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:12,840
Happy birthday, Smurfette!

1805
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:15,880
Do you mind? I'm trying to bookend this.

1806
01:34:15,970 --> 01:34:18,140
- And so... - Yo, let's kick it.

1807
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:22,810
...as the music unceremoniously drowns out the narration...

1808
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:24,930
This is for my new family.

1809
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:00,820
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! Stop, stop!

1810
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:05,370
Help me, Wanda! Help, help me, Wanda!

1811
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,870
And where do you think you're going? You are coming with me!

1812
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:23,200
How dare you call me that? I have bungled nothing!

1813
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:26,700
Well, Paris is over, my friend.

1814
01:44:26,790 --> 01:44:29,290
We're back here in the Dark Ages. I suggest you get used to it.

1815
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:34,330
You want room service? Why don't you yell out the window?

1816
01:44:36,170 --> 01:44:40,420
Don't you show your claws to me unless you are prepared to use them, Mr Pussy Foot!

1817
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:43,840
Pussy foot! Pussy foot! Pussy foot!

1818
01:44:44,050 --> 01:44:46,350
Stop it! Not the face! Not the face!

1819
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:28,580
{\blur1}~ Ooh my my baby don't be shy

1820
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:32,490
{\blur1}~ I see that spark flashing in your eye

1821
01:34:32,730 --> 01:34:36,020
{\blur1}~ My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all

1822
01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:40,140
{\blur1}~ So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

1823
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:43,870
{\blur1}~ Take my hand we can go all night

1824
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:47,340
{\blur1}~ And spin me round just the way I like

1825
01:34:48,130 --> 01:34:51,230
{\blur1}~ It feels so good I don't wanna stop

1826
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:54,930
{\blur1}~ So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

1827
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:59,270
{\blur1}~ la la la la la la

1828
01:34:59,350 --> 01:35:02,540
{\blur1}~ You don't have to wear no designer clothes

1829
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:06,240
{\blur1}~ Just as long as we're dancing on the floor

1830
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:10,180
{\blur1}~ Fingers in my hair and I'm letting go

1831
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:11,000
{\blur1}~ Tonight

1832
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,160
{\blur1}~ So free

1833
01:35:14,130 --> 01:35:16,140
{\blur1}~ You know can nobody get down like us

1834
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:19,950
{\blur1}~ We don't stop 'till we get enough

1835
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:23,760
{\blur1}~ C'mon turn it up 'till the speakers pop

1836
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:27,460
{\blur1}~ Break it down show me what you've got

1837
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:33,150
{\blur1}~ Ooh my my baby don't be shy

1838
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:39,890
{\blur1}~ Ooh my my baby don't be shy

1839
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:43,700
{\blur1}~ I see that spark flashing in your eye

1840
01:35:44,170 --> 01:35:47,440
{\blur1}~ My heart beats fast 'cause I want it all

1841
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:51,020
{\blur1}~ So baby come with me and be my ooh la la

1842
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,110
见证奇迹的时刻到啦

1843
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,530
我想想

1844
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,200
先来点

1845
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,120
含羞草花粉

1846
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,210
还有百合花瓣

1847
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,630
能让精灵精华有更强的活力

1848
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,300
除非我的咒语失去了作用

1849
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,310
最后再加上 思想的火花

1850
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,400
很久以前 在蓝精灵村庄里

1851
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,410
住着一群快乐的蓝精灵

1852
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,580
他们丝毫也不知道 就在不远处

1853
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,750
邪恶的巫师 格格巫

1854
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,500
正在策划着一个 邪恶的阴谋

1855
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,510
嘿

1856
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,920
嘿

1857
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,970
我说 你们到底想不想听故事了

1858
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,260
好吧 大家都安静点吧 音乐家们

1859
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,350
- 好吧 好吧 - 谢谢 然后呢

1860
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,850
格格巫说

1861
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,600
我要创造一个无比神奇的作品

1862
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:06,190
蓝妹妹 潜入他们的村庄 对付那些小精灵们

1863
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,790
哇哦

1864
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,290
她的样子好可怕哟

1865
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,960
- 她肯定是个怪物？- 没错

1866
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,220
而且她生性顽把皮整个村子闹得鸡飞狗跳

1867
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,600
甚至放水 淹了村子

1868
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,060
蓝精灵们都想赶她走

1869
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,230
但尽管她是格格巫一手创造的 蓝爸爸却看到了她好的一面

1870
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,490
用爱和友善 让她脱胎换骨 用一种神秘的魔法

1871
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,820
把她变成了一个真正的蓝精灵

1872
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,580
我们亲爱的蓝妹妹就这样诞生了

1873
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,750
- 嗨 - 我的天呐

1874
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,250
嗨 蓝妹妹

1875
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,590
啊 我好喜欢她的头发

1876
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,680
- 跳的好 蓝妹妹 - 太棒了

1877
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,720
哇哦 炫耀

1878
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,850
嘿 蓝妹妹

1879
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,270
- 哦 - 完美的屈体转身

1880
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,060
- 嗨 - 比美人鱼还漂亮

1881
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,900
她的头发怎么是干的？

1882
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,360
啊 不

1883
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,990
等等…

1884
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,120
愚蠢的蓝精灵们

1885
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,990
你们跑不了啦

1886
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,000
- 她是活的 - 往山上跑

1887
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,830
我只是个讲故事的

1888
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,960
世界末日来了

1889
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,000
她有罗魔杖

1890
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,760
不要搞坏我的蛋糕

1891
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
小心

1892
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,720
很好 我可爱的小家伙

1893
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,100
你可真是爸爸的好女儿啊

1894
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,070
哦 不

1895
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,820
蓝妹妹 你还好吧？

1896
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,200
哦 爸爸

1897
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,410
哦 好啦好啦 一切都会好起来的

1898
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
你是不是又做恶梦啦？

1899
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,750
爸爸 我每年生日的时候

1900
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,840
都会做那个关于我来历的恶梦

1901
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,510
我 我好想知道我是从哪来的

1902
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,720
每一年我都会告诉你 从哪来的并不重要 重要的是

1903
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,640
你想成为什么样的人

1904
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,520
真的吗？

1905
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,150
你不用完全相信我的话

1906
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,690
出去转转你自己去看看

1907
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,110
你就是属于这里的

1908
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,780
你是属于格格巫的

1909
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,370
你是属于格格巫的

1910

00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,220
你这个愚蠢的癫蛤蟆 先生

1916
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,390
你才是只蛤蟆

1917
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,850
看

1918
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,190

让整个时尚之都 巴黎 为之倾倒

1923
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,160
这位默默无闻的神秘大师

1924
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,580
在纽约被发掘之后 一鸣惊人

1925
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,340
嘿 别挡着路 怪物

1926
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,920

00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,090
嘿 不 快放我下来

1928

上天的感觉不错吧？

1929
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,390
大傻子

1930
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,230
从纽约街头的艺人化身为欧洲的新宠儿

1931
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,110
格格巫是首位 在巴黎歌剧院登台表演的魔术师

1932
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,360
不要走开

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,540
噢 我的天呐 我们能不能安静的做一回马车

1934
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,620
别再用精灵精华的消耗来折磨我了 好吗？

1935
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,040
在纽约 我已经从蓝爸爸那提取了最大的量

1936
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,880
阿兹猫 你说说 你提取了多少？

1937
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,470
我在浪费？

1938
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,630
你在说什么呢？

1939
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,140
我必须把那个男人变成蛤蟆 那是魔术表演 不是吗？

1940
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,600
因为没有精力精华 我就不能…

1941
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,480
我为什么要和你讨论这个问题？你又不会魔法

1942
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,810
你可以把这个发表在你的"脸书"个人主页上

1943
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,480
发表发表 随便发

1944
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,940
我说了

1945
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,450
我还有足够的精灵精华继续我那个令人兴奋的心狠手辣的计划

1946
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,700
现在 该和我的粉丝们见面了

1947
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,620
你们好

1948
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,910

1953
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,100

1959
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
呃 是给你的

1960
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,800
你不可能比我受欢迎

1961
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,300
一个小绿点儿？

1962
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,680
你为什么喜欢小绿点

1963
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,510
抓呀 抓呀

1964
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,970
爸爸会很喜欢的

1965
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,060
- 海库斯要玩玩了 - 嘿

1966
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,390
让海库斯和小猫咪一起玩玩

1967
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,730
掩护我

1968
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,850
呀呼 我来了

1969
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,400

00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,920
第十二回合 我们又赢啦

1979
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,050
说的好 我的傻兄弟

1980
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,420
很明显 那不是礼物 阿兹猫

1981
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,930
那是个圈套

1982
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,640
- 很有意思 我的小调皮们 - 嘿

1983
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,890
能让你开心吗 爸爸？

1984
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,970
不 这还不够

1985
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,850
想知道什么会让我开心吗？如果你们像蓝精灵那样 是蓝色的

1986
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,360
你们的精华就会像蓝精灵的精华那样赋予我真正的魔力

1987
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,360
那样我才会开心

1988
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,240
可惜你们两个 都是令人失望的试验品

1989
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,530
我是试验品？

1990
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,620
和那个叛徒蓝妹妹一个样

1991
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,830
横幅支到那边去 谢谢 玩偶做的不错

1992
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,210
- 怎么样 勇勇？- 再放下来一点 厌厌

1993
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,960
我希望对着他的关键部位 雷霆一击

嘿 是谁在蛋糕上 偷偷的咬了一口？

1997
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,010
- 不是我 - 我不知道

1998
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,140
- 蓝蓝？- 干嘛都看着我？

1999
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,390
嘿 聪聪 这是我为蓝妹妹的惊喜派对

2000

2001
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,980

蓝色警报 蓝色警报 重复 这不是演习 蓝色警报

2006
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,410
放开我 放开

2007
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,830
我们得让她离开

2008
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,040
她来了 淡定

2009
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,500
嗨 伙伴们

2010
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,170
有没有人想在这个特殊的日子里 做点有趣的事？

2011
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,170
嗨 福福

2012
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,590
想不想坐在喷泉边 欣赏自己的倒影？

2013
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,640
我已经看腻了自己的模样 蓝妹妹

2014
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,930
才怪呢

2015
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,930
我现在什么都不想做

2016
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,020
- 嗨 策划精灵 - 嗨

2017
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,930
- 嗨 灵灵 - 干嘛 亲爱的？

2018
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,100
有没有什么 我应该知道的有趣的事？

2019
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,440
没有 只有精灵音乐狂欢节

2020
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,860
那是个盛大的音乐节 对吗 小灵灵？

门票包在我身上…

2023
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,280
看来 没有人记得我的生日

2024
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,370
惊喜要泡汤了

2025
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,410
小声点 小声点

2026
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:46,300
要知道 蓝妹妹 其实偶尔单独待会 也是很不错

2027
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,800
- 就是 你快走吧 - 去吧 这里不需要你

2028
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
- 再见 - 你去哪儿

2029
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,470
再见

2030
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,430
我们表演得非常完美 对不对啊 小笨蛋

2031
00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:00,140
没错 她根本就没发现我们准备的惊喜

2032
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,560
笨蛋

2033
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,740
也许 我根本 就不属于这里

2034
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,860
祝你生日快乐

2035
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,360
祝你生日快乐

2036

这是一个纯绿色 无麸质富含抗氧化剂的阿萨伊桨果蛋糕

2042
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:43,020
是当地的索食大师 蓓蓓亲手做的 她从来就没见过花生

2043
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,730
大家都能吃 对吧？

2044
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,610
- 这盘子是含塑化剂吗？- 没

2045
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:52,030
- 没问题 很好 - 没问题 绝对不含塑化剂和顺丁烯

2046

是啊 你肯定有个好榜样

2053
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,670
不 其实呢…

2054
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,540
- 我爸爸在我5岁的时候就走了 所以… - 没迟到吧？

2055
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500

我们都以为你爸爸 离开你了呢

2066
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,780
没错 这个是我的继父

2067
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,450
你会巴不得他消失的

2068
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,490

你还好吗？

2071
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,250
自从布鲁出生以后

2072
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,920
还真怀念你那大肚子的模样大得没法拥抱

2073

- 您别这样 拜托 - 让大家看看

2076
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,590

2079
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,810
道尔家族的拥抱 胜过一切

2080
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,180

2095
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,170
嗯 接着

2096
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,670
吃吧 大个子 没事

2097
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,680
理由很简单 这是用花生油炸的

2098
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
花生油？

2099
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,600
- 什么？- 强尼 快吐 快点吐出来

2100
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,220
我来打急救电话

2101
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,730
吐出来 强尼 吐出来 快点 吐到妈妈手上

2102
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,890
别呼吸 我给你打针

2103
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,230
- 还好吧 - 孩子嘴唇怎么了？

2104
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,030
- 阿兹猫 把计划书拿过来 - 爸爸？

2105
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,160
就在浴室里 应该在梳妆台上

2106
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
爸爸

2107
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,950
我们该吃饭了

2108
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,830
海库斯头晕

2109
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,000
我差点给忘啦

2110
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,420
我还得养活你们两个

2111
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,840
希望你们能知道 这对我是个多么沉重的负担呐

2112
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,130
嗯 好了 要注意礼貌

2113
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,550
谢谢

2114
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,840
如果你们是真的蓝精灵 就能从你们身上提取精华了

2115
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,510
你好像还没说"谢谢"

2116
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,310
就当是吧 好了 过来

2117
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,600
我们要在今晚突袭蓝精灵村庄前再重温一遍计划

2118
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,730
这根本不是我的手稿 我的计划书呢？

2119
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,730
这是电子版的

2120
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,950
不明白是什么意思

2121
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,450
是的 第一步"制造调皮鬼" 是的

2122
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,620
完成 那第二步呢？

2123
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,960
喔 看起来很有意思

2124
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,710
让开让开 快 快点让开

2125
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,750
第三部 呃 划一下

2126
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,720
抓住我那个不听话的女儿

2127
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,010
逼她说出蓝爸爸把她变蓝的那个神秘秘方

2128
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,180
划一下

2129
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,390
我要把几百个调皮鬼都变成蓝精灵

2130
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,470
海库斯变蓝

2131
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,480
海库斯变蓝

2132
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,400
然后把你们放进一个恐怖的机器里提取精华

2133
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
- 什么？- 最后

2134
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,610
全世界的人都将臣服于我

2135
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,610
那提取过程会很疼吗？

2136
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,280
那是非常的疼

2137
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,490
你会看到那是非常有意思的

2138
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,580
对我来说太远的事就先不说了

2139
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:36,080
回到第二部 我们来到这个充满奶酪的大都市的终极目标

2140
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,590
就是这个高高的大铁塔

2141
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,260
这是控制足够的能量

2142
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,840
从而打开通往蓝精灵村庄中心的大门的唯一可行方法

2143
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,600
我可等不及了

2144
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,770
快跟我来 去占领大铁塔

2145
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,940
起作用啦

2146
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,560
太好啦 精华正好够用

2147
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,660
现在 我将被载入史册

2148
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,620
没有什么阻止我

2149
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,420
我的鸽子蛋呐

2150
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
噢 不

2151
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,140
现在给你们展示一下我的才华

2152
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,220
头在旋转

2153
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:24,280
看来想打开通过人类的入口我的精华还不够

2154
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,570
爸爸 我正好能通过 我去把蓝妹妹抓来

2155
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,700
我也要去 我也要去

2156
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,200
- 嘿 - 我也要去

2157
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,240
好吧 好吧 看看到底 该让谁去呢？

2158
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,040
- 到底谁是大傻瓜 - 选我 选我

2159
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,170
月亮

2160
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,210
哦吔

2161
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,340
- 嘿 你过来听我说 - 什么？

2162
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,630
我赢了

2163
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,380
你做得很好 维克茜

2164
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,050
现在 我必须警告你

2165
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,720
你的目的地是一个非常恐怖的地方

2166
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,310
那是个到处都充满了残忍的 宁静王国

2167
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,600
偶尔还能听到一些讨厌的刺耳的欢声笑语

2168
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,440
- 很可怕 - 真是个噩梦

2169
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,900
是的 那地方彻底毁了你的姐姐

2170
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,270
坏女孩变成了好女孩 真让人遗憾

2171
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
说得对

2172
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,990
但是她知道那神秘的配方

2173
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,320
所以 去把蓝妹妹抓回来

2174
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,080
我真是想不明白

2175
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,290
他们明明知道我今天过生日

2176
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,250
竟然没有一个人记得

2177
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,170
爸爸错了

2178
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,180
我永远都不能真正的融入他们

2179
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,680
- 啊 不 - 救命

2180
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,440
求求你 别走

2181
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,020
我是逃出来的

2182
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,360
逃出来的？

2183
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,900
从那个邪恶的巫师制造我的人那里

2184
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,110
你说的是 格格巫？

2185
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,780
格格巫是你的父亲吗？

2186
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,330
是的

2187
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,040
但是他…

2188
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,920
就是说 你和我是一样的

2189
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,170
- 抓住你了 - 啊 你干什么

2190
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,210
爸爸一定会很高兴的

2191
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,960
蓝妹妹有麻烦了

2192
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,170
- 不 - 哦 天呐

2193
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,300
- 快过来 蓝精灵 - 蓝妹妹

2194
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,970
啊 不

2195
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,800
- 你逃不掉的 - 啊 不 放开我

2196
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,390
- 走吧 - 进去吧

2197
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,020
不…

2198
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,230
- 她被人抓走了 - 不

2199
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,020
再见 蓝精灵们

2200
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,150
- 蓝妹妹 - 蓝妹妹

2201
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,360
我们现在怎么办？

2202
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,280
我的推理能力明确的告诉我 这件事绝对是格格巫的主意

2203
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,410
哦 不 不

2204
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,080
- 吔 - 好漂亮的蓝色

2205
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,500
格格巫

2206
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,710
蓝妹妹 欢迎回家

2207
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,510
你这样做是没用的 格格巫

2208
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,310
蓝爸爸会带他们来救我的

2209
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,230
我可不这么认为

2210
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,850
他们曾经救了笨笨

2211
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,610
是的 但别忘了笨笨是一个真正的蓝精灵

2212
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,900
要知道 我才是制造你的那个人

2213
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,530
你一定要记忆深刻 对吗 亲爱的？

2214
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,450
你不是我爸爸 赶快让我回家

2215
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,870
当然

2216
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,250
你怎样想都行

2217
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:30,380
但是 首先我需要一点点东西

2218
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,510
- 非常小？- 是什么？

2219
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:38,550
就是 呃 蓝爸爸用来把你变成真正蓝精灵的那个神秘的配方

2220
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,390
我要成为真正的蓝精灵 我要变成蓝色

2221
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,680
像你一样 小黄毛

2222
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,230
这对我们大家都好 难道你不明白吗 我的小宝贝？

2223
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,520
你把配方给我 我把我的调皮鬼们变成蓝色

2224
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,400
- 蓝色 - 我们可以用他们的元素

2225
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,610
继续在这里表演我的精彩魔法

2226
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:58,240
这样 我就不会再打扰你们蓝精灵村啦

2227
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,330
我不会相信你 我不会告诉你任何事情

2228
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,000
好吧 看来你是不见棺材不落泪咯

2229
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,330
调皮鬼们 攻击

2230
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,380
乐意效劳

2231
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,500
攻击

2232
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,550
- 不是互相攻击 - 不是打我

2233
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,590
抓到你啦

2234
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,930
海库斯

2235
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,640
小猫咪 小猫咪 小猫咪

2236
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,720
别打猫咪

2237
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,730
真是相当相当失败的 试验品

2238
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,480
我们要去救蓝妹妹

2239
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,060
我们的营救计划是什么？

2240
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,610
好了 精灵们 都听着

2241
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,440
自从上次出现蓝月我就是在那个时刻存下来 足够的石谷水

2242
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,860
我可以把它炼成 精灵传送水晶

2243
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,030
啊 那你就不需要传送通道啦 真聪明啊 爸爸

2244
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,410
你说对了

2245
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,500
这样我们就能够直接进入到温斯洛先生的房子里

2246
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,830
对 上次还是帕特里克和格蕾丝 帮我们进去的呢

2247
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,790
是这样的 他们知道怎么做

2248
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
- 我要去 - 我也要去

2249
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,960
- 随时待命 爸爸 - 选我

2250
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,630
- 有没有人说 贝贝也想去 - 最好不要选我

2251
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,720
我 我 还有我 爸爸

2252
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,180
安静 孩子们 我存的石谷水 只够做出9块水晶

2253
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,560
所以我只能带3个人回来 再加上一个蓝妹妹

2254
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,680
前提是能找到她 但很渺茫

2255
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,400
这可不是一种积极的态度 厌厌

2256
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,560
事实上 这对我来说 已经够好

2257
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,730
我需要勇气和智慧 还有力量

2258
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,110
- 所以勇勇 - 哎

2259
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,320
- 聪聪 - 没问题

2260
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,530
- 健健 - 听到

2261
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,490
- 你们和我一起去 - 呃 我能…

2262
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,830
说吧 消极悲观的小精灵

2263
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,750
我认为聪聪可真是一个很棒的选择

2264
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,830
祝你们好运

2265
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,210
他这是怎么了？

2266
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,170
-这可不是他的风格 - 这很正常

2267
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,590
- 好了 健健你拿一个 - 我们行动吧

2268
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,760
- 让一下 - 糟糕

2269
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
笨笨

2270
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,170
快点救他

2271
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,510
快让开 我知道怎么救被噎住的人

2272
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
他看起来糟糕透了

2273
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,850
天呐 他的脸都变蓝了

2274
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:45,930
不太妙

2275
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,890
把我的水晶还我

2276
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,850
干的漂亮 笨笨

2277
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,230
我抓住啦

2278
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,860
再见

2279
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,190
这块应该是给健健的

2280
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,690
抱歉 都怪我

2281
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,320
长途旅行会让我全身浮肿的

2282
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,410
再见

2283
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,240
好吧 有时候你需要学会 随遇而安

2284
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,410
一路平安 爸爸

2285
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,210
蓝爸爸 带着他那不靠谱的队伍

2286
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,750
我会帮你看好家的

2287
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,040
- 蓝爸爸带着… - 把蓝妹妹救回来

2288
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,880
- 够了 - 带她回家

2289
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,970
很高兴他呼吸通畅了 而且嘴唇也恢复了正常

2290
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,800
再一次表示抱歉

2291
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,970
然后… 喂？

2292
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,850
强尼呼吸正常了 谢天谢地 他父母可都是律师

2293
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,820
难怪那么大惊小怪的

2294
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,110
那不是大惊小怪

2295
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,940
它不行了

2296
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,110
我们应该玩这个

2297
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,410
你怎么把王冠带来了 不用给他戴这个

2298
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,990
你以前很喜欢戴的

2299
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,450
- 我没喜欢过不 - 不 喜欢过

2300
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,200
- 你走哪都戴 - 才没有呢

2301
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,370
没有 从来没有

2302
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,580
你一向都这样…快看

2303
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
你看他们在干什么呢？

2304
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,800
在联络感情

2305
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,090
- 他们那是在吐口水 - 好啦

2306
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,600
布鲁需要知道 家庭成员不只我们两个

2307
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,600
多跟爷爷相处 对他没什么坏处

2308
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,180
干得好

2309
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,980
- 是吗 他是一个很糟糕的榜样 - 好了 帕特里克

2310
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,520
格蕾丝 他就是个破坏大王

2311
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,280
他能做的 就是搞砸一切 仅此而已

2312
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,610
就像 他第一次来到我家

2313
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,910
就把我的鹦鹉送人了

2314
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,990
你的鹦鹉？

2315
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,160
是我爸爸的鹦鹉

2316
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,920
离开我们的时候 留下的宙斯 我很喜欢那只鸟

2317
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,840
我当时还是个孩子 宙斯我父亲给我留下的唯一的东西

2318
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,050
你去那里

2319
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,470
怎么了？

2320
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,110
小心孩子 布鲁？

2321
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,780
布鲁？

2322
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,240
布鲁 维克多

2323
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,170
- 待在这 - 维克多 布鲁怎么样？

2324
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,540
维克多 门怎么打不开

2325
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,000
维克多

2326
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,590
- 维克多 快把门打开 - 维克多 我们打不开门

2327
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
我看不见了 我看不见了

2328
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,480
我到了一个黑暗的 荒凉的 闻起来有股玉米热狗昧道的星球上

2329
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,520
这简直太恐怖啦

2330
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,280
抱歉先生 你的脸挡了我的路

2331
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,950
- 好像是笨笨 蓝精灵？- 外星人？

2332
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,700
- 救命 - 注意 厌厌

2333
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,410
- 笨笨 是你吗？- 这边 这边

2334
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,960
- 我看不见啦 - 你钻进了玉米热狗袋子里了

2335
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,250
我知道这次会送命的

2336
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,590
这是哪？

2337
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,630
这里怎么这么陌生 这么恐怖？

2338
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,140
好帅呀

2339
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,970
你好 帅哥

2340
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,780
大家都还好吗？

2341
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,140
这不好

2342
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,480
这里一片黑暗 而且还有一股玉米热狗昧

2343
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
小心

2344
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,440
温斯洛先生已经老啦

2345
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,230
- 等等 等等 - 布鲁？

2346
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,440
不不 停下 快停下 他们是朋友

2347
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,610
- 朋友？- 对

2348
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,650
小外星人想要把我的脸偷走

2349
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,450
不 不 他们是蓝精灵

2350
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,780
他们是你见过的 最友善的生物了

2351
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,870
除了我

2352
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,000
对 除了你 厌厌

2353
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,200
蓝爸爸 笨笨

2354
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,790
- 帕特里克 - 温斯洛先生

2355
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,330
- 你好 格蕾丝 - 精灵 精灵 精灵

2356
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,090
- 他就是布鲁吧？- 个头可真大呀

2357
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,670
幸好不是我引领他 降生人世

2358
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:53,510
好吧 既然布鲁喜欢他们 那维克多也喜欢他们

2359
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,640
真像坐过山车一样 惊险刺激

2360
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,470
请不要对我拍照

2361
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
他叫福福

2362
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,140
是个自恋狂

2363
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,310
你们来这干什么？

2364
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,810
蓝妹妹被带到这来了

2365
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,230
- 等等 什么？- 带？什么叫带？

2366
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,690
蓝妹妹被该死的格格巫给绑架啦

2367
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,570
她当然落单了 以为 她认为我们忘记了她的生日

2368
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,110
那是一个 不该发生的错误

2369
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,830
如果能找到格格巫 就会找到她

2370
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,870
呃 这不太难 他现在是大明星

2371
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,870
- 他现在在巴黎 - 我去找人看狗

2372
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,210
你负责布鲁的护照

2373
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,460
超棒 营救蓝精灵的任务 我也要去

2374
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,710
我也去 多一个人 多一份力量

2375
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,590
等一下 布鲁的护照？

2376
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,420
总不能这样说走就走吧？

2377
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,930
至少 不能全都去

2378
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:36,600
好吧 你算是一个反对票 谁投赞成票？

2379
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,850
- 我 - 还有我

2380
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,310
爸爸就没赢过

2381
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,400
听着 事关我的好朋友蓝妹妹 必须得去

2382
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,650
如果确定要行动 那我们就应该有一个周密的计划

2383
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,270
啦啦啦啦啦 唱支快乐歌

2384
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,930
好了 我们到了 维克多 能抱一下布鲁吗？

2385
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,270
- 好了 计划都清楚了 对吗？- 是的

2386
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,430
我们到格格巫演出的地方

2387
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,100
- 去找蓝妹妹 - 对

2388
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,110
我去格格巫住的宾馆 想办法确定 他住的哪间房

2389
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,650
维克多 你和布鲁在这里登记订个客房

2390
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,070
- 事实上 我在想 - 不 事实上你不用做任何事

2391
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
你和布鲁上楼去

2392
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,610
就这么定了 快去吧

2393
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,990
去歌剧院 不错嘛

2394
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,660
我的法语说的很性感 对吗？

2395
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,710
- 我再给你买顶便礼帽吧 - 你无法抵档我的性感的魅力

2396
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,710
- 我无法抵挡你的魅力 - 嘿

2397
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,000
去开房吧

2398
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,590
- 好运 - 小心点

2399
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,920
好的

2400
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,220
你 把配方给他吧

2401
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,180
你 把配方给他吧

2402
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,680
把配方给他吧

2403
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,440
你想把配方给他

2404
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,560
给他配方 再也不当捣蛋鬼

2405
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,320
这会让你很舒服的 快把配方给他吧

2406
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,700
坏丫头 别唱了

2407
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,040
我要把我知道的 都告诉你

2408
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,830
可是我什么都不知道

2409
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,840
怎么啦 怎么啦？

2410
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,710
"缓冲"？搞什么呀

2411
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,470
观众在等着我

2412
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,640
我要让这些傻瓜们再一次为我疯狂

2413
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,640
担心精华不够用的是吗？

2414
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,020
完成表演绝对没问题

2415
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:51,480
因为 我们现在想要多少精华就有多少 难道不是吗？

2416
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,030
我需要稍稍取一点

2417
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,820
不

2418
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,820
就剪耳朵边的一点好吗？

2419
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,910
这里

2420
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,240
等我爸爸来了 你会后悔的

2421
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:06,500
你爸爸是不会来的 因为你真正的爸爸 就站在这了

2422
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,960
- 没错 - 现在

2423
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,500
你是想做个乖女儿把配方给我呢？

2424
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,960
还是想在我最新型的超级精华提取器里

2425
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,300
凄凄惨惨的度过你的下半生？

2426
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,300
我劝你一定要想清楚

2427
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,800
你自己来决定

2428
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,810
爸爸 爸爸

2429
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,930
是

2430
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,350
干得好 亲爱的

2431
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,310
至于你嘛 也不错

2432
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
阿兹猫

2433
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,650
你可以按下提取器的按钮啦

2434
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,820
过来 过来 过来

2435
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,410
我们把这些头发 转化成精灵精华

2436
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,950
爸爸 快点来吧

2437
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,910
我好害怕

2438
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,330
可怜的娃娃要哭了

2439
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,920
你好哇 漂亮的女士

2440
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,300
巫师啊 上场了吧

2441
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,970
- 嗨 - 您好

2442
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,430
不知道您能不能好心的告诉我 是哪一间？

2443
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,350
是格格巫先生的房间？

2444
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,600
不行 这是规矩

2445
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,280
就停那吧 我们到了 谢谢

2446
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,950
我们在这里 伙计们巴黎圣母院

2447
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,780
- 简直太壮观了 - 格格巫现在混得确实不错

2448
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,450
希望蓝妹妹就在这里

2449
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,670
我喜欢听好听的音乐 惭愧

2450
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,090
- 你听在说什么？- 不知道

2451
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,820
等一下 等一下

2452
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,400
我说过 出场时烟雾要大一点 这烟雾也太少了

2453
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,660
阿拉塔（咒语）

2454
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,160
神圣的蓝精灵

2455
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:12,910
- 他是怎么做到的？- 他比以前强了不少

2456
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,970
我现在很生气

2457
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,390
我现在非常生气

2458
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,390
我很抱歉 您是谁？

2459
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,100
我是格格巫先生的经理人 名字叫多莉特

2460
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,110
就这种条件 你们也敢叫豪华客房？

2461
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,360
- 拿破仑套房？- 拿破仑套房？

2462
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,110
但是女士 这是我们酒店最好的套房

2463
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,860
您对哪不满意

2464
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,120
那我就说说 首先 楼层就不好

2465
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,160
没人喜欢住在…

2466
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,960
- 住在第五层 - 是的 那实在是太低了

2467
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,300
晚上好 晚上好

2468
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,760
好了 伙计们 该进去了

2469
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,620
不不不

2470
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,140
很好

2471
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,140
好 爸爸 从我的毛衣里出来

2472
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,390
趁着我跟这个大傻子胡说八道的时候

2473
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,850
从我衣服溜出来 然后进去这化妆间

2474
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:19,150
简直像度假一样 这可真是一个减压的好方法

2475
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,320
- 别垂头丧气的 厌厌 - 对 会成功的

2476
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,070
- 哦 先生们 先解决猫的问题吧 - 下来 下来

2477
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,910
大家不必惊慌

2478
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,160
对待评论家们 我向来是这样

2479
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,120
顺绳子爬上去

2480
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,000
为了救蓝妹妹 这样值得吗？

2481
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,420
- 这是任务… - 快走吧

2482
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,040
- 对不起 先生 这是规定 - 什么？太让人气愤了

2483
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,130
你们的家人将付出沉重的代价

2484
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,840
你们中 会有人死掉

2485
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,230
不 很抱歉 需要刷您的房卡

2486
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,070
是的 当然 亲爱的 我的房卡

2487
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,200
哦 天呐 不见了

2488
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:13,200
我早上去吃过早餐在蒂芬妮

2489
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,460
我得去那 找找看

2490
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,300
我打赌爬绳子会让我的屁股上的肌肉很有型

2491
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,890
厌厌 你看看嘛

2492
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,010
我讨厌这样

2493
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,260
- 嘘 - 噢 快点

2494
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,390
你要打断我的魔法 最起码要逗我开心

2495
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,060
现在 你们可以热烈欢迎最伟大的 魔法不灭的格格巫

2496
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,480
你来这里做什么 你怎么敢这样？

2497
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,450
你闻到了可疑的气昧 你当然会闻到了

2498
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,030
我天天看你闻你自己

2499
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,660
别在这捣乱啦

2500
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,820
嘿 爸爸

2501
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,290
- 布鲁？- 嘿 你先听着…

2502
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,410
布鲁和我决定了 不能让你一个人 面对危险

2503
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,540
我们应该齐心协力

2504
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,250
道尔家族应该祖孙三代并肩作战

2505
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,420
撇开我们所有的分歧

2506
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,760
我们和道尔家族没有关系

2507
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,130
你叫温斯洛·道尔

2508
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,220
你就是不肯正确面对姓氏问题

2509
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,390
停 你们为什么要笑？

2510
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,510
通常在魔术中 猫都很大 不是吗？

2511
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,770
像是老虎 狮子之类的

2512
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,400
安静点 混蛋 我会让你如愿以偿的

2513
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
阿拉塔 猫来啦

2514
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,200
千万别让他发现我们

2515
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,790
这是我人生当中 最糟糕的旅行

2516
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,330
我也就旅行过两次

2517
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:42,120
- 看 格格巫的化妆间 就在那 - 眼神不错啊 福福

2518
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,210
门上居然贴个五角星

2519
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,330
走吧

2520
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,710
回去我也要在房子上贴个五角星

2521
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,720
- 如果我们想要变成蓝色 - 蓝色

2522
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,680
我们就必须想个办法 让她开口说话

2523
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,550
- 对 - 想出办法了吗？

2524
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,010
我想到了 "求"她说

2525
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,850
算了吧 我忘了你是头猪

2526
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,690
- 好吧 听听我的计划 - 好的

2527
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:06,770
想法让她变成跟我们一样的捣蛋鬼

2528
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,900
捣蛋 捣蛋

2529
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,280
就利用了她的优点了 对吧？

2530
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,110
一旦成功 她就会觉得跟我们是一家人

2531
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,370
一家人 我喜欢一家人

2532
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,910
我喜欢这个计划

2533
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,160
- 噢 不 - 破碎的家庭

2534
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,620
- 抓住她 - 抓住她 抓住蓝妹妹

2535
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,580
再见了 捣蛋鬼们

2536
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,420
父亲会杀了我们的

2537
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,170
- 在家 丑八怪 - 抓住她

2538
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,220
- 有人吗？- 蓝妹妹？

2539
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,550
- 你在哪呢？- 快问快答

2540
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,720
抢答题 在够不到门把手的情况下 我们怎么才能进去呢？

2541
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,010
不 不 不

2542
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,980
一个空空的房间 居然就把你给干倒了

2543
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,070
有没有人想要上来

2544
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,320
和这个 某些人强烈要求出现的大猫咪

2545
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,450
走 快 走

2546
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,570
- 找到蓝妹妹 我们马上走 - 对

2547
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,780
- 万一被吃掉了 也可以吐出来 - 你

2548
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,120
变魔术的 交出蓝妹妹

2549
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,790
你刚才说什么？

2550
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,540
没听见吗？

2551
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,920
把蓝妹妹叫出来

2552
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,630
你竟敢这样 阿拉塔…

2553
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,920
- 鸭子 - 鸭子

2554
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,550
鸭子？

2555
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,600
这下完蛋了

2556
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,220
不

2557
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,310
你

2558
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,690
冲着伟大的美丽胡子发誓 我记得你

2559
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,650
布鲁 我们又见面啦

2560
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:35,150
爸爸飞啦 爸爸飞啦

2561
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,830
看起来终于有一个志愿者啦

2562
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,040
那就别再浪费时间了 张大嘴 阿兹猫

2563
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,000
放他下来 你这混蛋

2564
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,880
放下我的儿子

2565
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,260
你敢惹道尔家族的人 你就死定了

2566
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
又是你

2567
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,860
你在干什么？放我下来

2568
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,020
快走 布鲁

2569
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,570
放我下来 我可以抓到他

2570
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,780
今天的表演到这就结束了

2571
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,450
再见

2572
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,910
走吧 走吧 走吧

2573
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,160
蓝妹妹的头发 她来过这里

2574
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,160
看呐 我发现了什么

2575
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,830
一个相当完美的肖像

2576
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,630
如果你真能帮上忙 那该有多好

2577
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,630
不要讨厌我 憎恨游戏吧

2578
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,970
- 蓝妹妹？- 蓝妹妹？

2579
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,260
嘿 这是咖啡吗？

2580
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,470
有人想来一杯咖啡吗？

2581
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,640
嘿 这是什么？

2582
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,560
是一面镜子 你这个白痴

2583
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,440
振作起来 使劲 快来推啊

2584
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,150
坏脾气比帅哥优先

2585
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,730
不管这是什么 都让我感到非常紧张

2586
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,200
吓了我一跳 我的意思是…

2587
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,450
格格巫

2588
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,700
笨笨 你想要我们的命吗？

2589
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,160
这应该是一种魔法窗口

2590
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,040
也许能看到蓝妹妹在哪里

2591
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
调皮鬼们

2592
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,300
- 格格巫 - 快逃走 快

2593
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,880
好的 这边 这边

2594
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,340
蓝妹妹？呃？

2595
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,470
跑哪去了？呃？

2596
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,300
- 快点伙计们 - 在这里 他来了 快点

2597
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,140
- 快点走 快点走 - 哪去了？

2598
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,810
- 孩子们？蓝妹妹？- 去后面 快快快

2599
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,600
关门 快关门

2600
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,230
你爸爸回来啦

2601
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,190
她的爸爸？

2602
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,900
我可不喜欢你跟我开这种玩笑

2603
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,610
- 你好？- 是在下面吗

2604
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,530
- 你下来 你们这些小罪犯 - 站着别动

2605
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,620
他们肯定是回到酒店去了

2606
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,040
我们实在是没有时间了

2607
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,920
如果那个帕特里克在附近 那么蓝爸爸肯定也在附近

2608
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
快点去酒店 必须在他之前找到蓝妹妹

2609
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,930
我的脸 我的脸

2610
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,390
- 怎么了？- 跟以前一样帅

2611
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,930
我们摔倒啦 不是我的错

2612
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,140
有人吗？有人吗？

2613
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:17,060
我的天呐

2614
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,950
我的屁股好疼口阿

2615
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,320
爸爸 这些跟蓝妹妹有什么关系吗？

2616
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,910
所有东西都有关系 我真害怕

2617
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:33,120
为什么要建立这样吓人的设备？

2618
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,750
那个超级蓝精灵机器？

2619
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,670
用来提取我们的精华的

2620
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,550
这些东西 是干什么用的？

2621
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,970
是用来大量囚禁蓝精灵的

2622
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,890
蓝妹妹要是把配方给了他

2623
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:53,270
他可以把无数的调皮鬼 变成蓝精灵 来满足他贪婪的野心

2624
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,020
伙计们？

2625
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,710
上面写着 大决战

2626
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,530
天呐

2627
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,370
快扶我一下 拜托

2628
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,370
这地方的垃圾该收一收了

2629
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,960
想想 蓝妹妹 想想

2630
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,210
- 蓝妹妹在哪 她在哪儿？- 她在哪里

2631
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,630
我喜欢这个游戏

2632
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:25,300
等等 我们让她跑一会 她没有地方可以去

2633
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,430
- 这对我的计划很有帮助 - 是啊 是啊

2634
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:30,220
是我变成了鸭子 你生什么气？

2635
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:33,470
你总是横插一脚 把事情搞砸 你到了哪就乱套

2636
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,230
看着我的眼睛再说一遍

2637
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:38,730
- 我做不到 - 那就对了 因为那不是真的

2638
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,520
不 我做不到是因为你的眼睛 长在脑袋两边

2639
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,360
这样让我更能看出你对我的不尊敬

2640
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,320
- 你们看什么看？- 你快点走吧

2641
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,280
天气变暖啦 普利斯

2642
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,660
终于甩掉他们了吗？

2643
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,790
好狗狗

2644
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,250
哦 不不… 对不起 打扰了

2645
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,670
好吧 我能行的

2646
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:19,650
爸爸 你在哪呢？

2647
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,110
为什么我对通过下水道离开 格格巫的老窝 一点都不奇怪呢？

2648
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,780
- 温斯洛先生 - 蓝爸爸

2649
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,610
- 帕特里克 - 怎么回事？

2650
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,950
格格巫设计了一个非常可怕的计划

2651
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,580
哪来只鸭子？

2652
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,830
那是维克多 格格巫把他变成了一只鸭子

2653
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,080
- 肯定知道计划已经泄密了 - 我是想 来帮忙

2654
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,130
维克多 你看起来像家禽

2655
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,040
好的 我知道了 我知道了

2656
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:47,550
别闹了 都听我说 我们一定要尽快找到蓝妹妹

2657
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,390
- 她在那 那 - 追上去吗？

2658
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,720
嘿 海库斯 看见糖果店了吗？

2659
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,060
- 糖果 糖果 - 我有个主意

2660
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:00,730
你去糖果店找麻烦 使劲捣乱 剩下的我来处理

2661
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:03,810
我最制造麻烦 捣乱 捣乱 捣乱

2662
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:08,030
小黄毛 你要去哪啊？

2663
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,570
用不着你管

2664
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,160
看样子 你所谓的爸爸不要你了

2665
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,200
不 才不是呢

2666
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:17,160
他会来找我的

2667
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:23,040
不会的 因为他知道 你回到了应该在的地方

2668
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,380
我没有绑架你 蓝妹妹

2669
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,630
我是带你回家

2670
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:32,300
我要制造一个大麻烦

2671
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:40,430
美味的糖果

2672
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,570
麻烦啦

2673
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,280
你好

2674
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:08,500
噢 我的天呐 他会被杀掉的 我们得去救他

2675
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,630
我认为你应该是个善良的人

2676
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,130
但是…

2677
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:14,970
救命啊

2678
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,510
天呐

2679
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,060
好吧 我们走

2680
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,480
不 我已经陷入麻烦啦

2681
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,940
- 维克茜 - 噢 不 海库斯

2682
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,190
救命

2683
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:26,730
救救我 海库斯

2684
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,530
蓝妹妹 我们该怎么办呢？

2685
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,070
维克茜 帮我一下 快点跳

2686
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:38,240
- 漂亮 - 神圣的蓝精灵

2687
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:41,500
- 身手不错 蓝妹妹 - 尝尝这个 很好吃

2688
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,790
快走 海库斯

2689
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,710
维克茜 快上车

2690
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,760
抓紧啦

2691
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,550
小心

2692
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,630
不错嘛 偷了辆小车

2693
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,970
我没有想要偷车

2694
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,600
- 对不起 - 好吧 这不是你偷的 对吧？

2695
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,930
捣乱 捣乱 捣乱

2696
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,100
你和我们是同样的

2697
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,860
我该怎么让蓝妹妹把配方交给我呢 阿兹猫？

2698
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,110
她的态度真让我特别想…

2699
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,150
哭？不 我想把她扔进马桶冲走

2700
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,820
一定要想个好办法

2701
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,620
尽管我知道你的脑袋只有豌豆那么大

2702
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:24,160
是她生日？真的？管我屁事

2703
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:28,250
送礼物？送蛋糕？

2704
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:29,380
糖衣炮弹？

2705
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:37,300
通过贿赂和恭维来软化她那颗 石头一样的心

2706
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,430
有点不合套路 但没准还真能管用

2707
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,180
我居然能想出这么好的主意

2708
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,600
让我想想

2709
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:47,350
好了 好了

2710
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,060
该送她什么礼物呢？

2711
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,320
- 猫咪 猫咪 猫咪 - 嗨 大笨猫

2712
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,530
安静点 阿兹猫 我正在想 送什么样的礼物

2713
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:58,910
能显得既真诚又贴心 好搞定那个蓝妹妹

2714
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,320
我说 不是现在

2715
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:05,040
不是现在 不是现在 不是现在 不是现在

2716
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,830
你自己走回去吧

2717
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:10,330
猫咪

2718
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,500
快点 再快点

2719
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:14,590
抱歉 让开

2720
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,170
怎么停下这东西啊？

2721
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,680
我不认为这是个很难的问题

2722
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:21,680
尽在掌握中

2723
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,310
- 美味的布丁 - 海库斯这是泥巴

2724
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:30,020
美味的泥巴

2725
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,230
有本事来抓我呀 臭猫

2726
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,030
小心

2727
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,410
吔

2728
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,530
- 漂亮 我们走 - 漂亮 我们走

2729
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,950

2730
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,210
哦 不 大笨猫 大笨猫 快跑

2731
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,540
女士们 换个姿势

2732
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:52,830
- 跟我来 伙计们 - 快点

2733
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,710
- 快飞起来 - 快

2734
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,050
快骑到鹤身上 快上

2735
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,340
我们走

2736
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,420
等等 海库斯在哪儿？

2737
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,930
飞吧 大白鹤 飞吧

2738
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,800
猫咪来了 小心

2739
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,390
快上来 海库斯我们走

2740
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:10,190
吔

2741
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:13,020
看呐 漂亮猫咪吔

2742
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:15,270
再见了 小猫咪

2743
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:18,490
真是太奇妙了

2744
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:22,160
大家往后飞 大家往后飞

2745
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,910
真是太漂亮啦

2746
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:32,330
我掉下来啦 掉下来啦

2747
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,000
蓝妹妹是我的英雄

2748
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,550
- 情况怎么样？- 好得一塌糊涂 好的所有的事情

2749
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:42,260
好到所有的事情都变成了彻底的灾难

2750
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:44,470
简直是注定的

2751
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:46,810
我倒是有个好消息

2752
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:52,390
我给你借了一套服务员的制服 还有一张电梯卡配套来的

2753
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,600
这些是怎么弄到的？

2754
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,070
我到雅典娜广场的洗衣房 骗他们说

2755
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:01,190
我是国际服装督察官 杜丽特小姐来检查工作

2756
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,160
比梅里尔斯普演得还像

2757
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:05,740
干得漂亮 格蕾丝

2758
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:08,330
是每个人都有新衣服 还是只有帕特里克有？

2759
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,080
- 窗户 - 那是谁？

2760
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,210
是维克多

2761
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:15,710
酒店前台不让他进来 所以只能飞上来

2762
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,800
缺乏纵身感

2763
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,800
维克多爷爷是鸭子

2764
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,300
是格格巫施的魔法

2765
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,800
你能把他变回来 对吗？

2766
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,510
不 但这咒语的效力不常

2767
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,140
最后会自己失效的

2768
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:30,560
大家别走这么严肃嘛 这根本不是问题

2769
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,140
我看见我生了蛋 还请各位保密

2770
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,810
你看起来好像没觉得苦恼

2771
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,190
苦恼这两个字 和我鸭子根本就不粘边

2772
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,860
抖抖身上的羽毛 身上的烦恼就全没啦

2773
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,240
真的吗 你真是这么认为的？

2774
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,160
- 我很欣赏 这和我们蓝精灵很像 - 非常蓝精灵化

2775
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,530
谢谢 看见啦？

2776
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,740
这个小圣诞精灵都非常欣赏我

2777
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:54,710
也许有一天 帕特里克 你也会学会欣赏我这种蓝精灵的品格

2778
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,920
好吧 我 这个… 算了…

2779
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,880
我不想跟鸭子讨论这个问题

2780
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:02,420
我好像感冒啦

2781
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:03,760
我也希望我感冒啦

2782
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:06,090
健健的水晶飞进我的喉陇

2783
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:09,010
被当成玉米热狗袭击 掉进下水道

2784
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,520
如果还不够难闻的话

2785
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,690
还被夹在腋下外出 仅仅因为我们快要绝种啦

2786
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,400
- 我的天呐 我是个悲观者 - 而且是百分之百

2787
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:22,700
厌厌 我们可能绝种的唯一原因

2788
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:25,650
就是蓝妹妹把秘密配方交给格格巫

2789
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,990
- 但是蓝妹妹绝对不会那么做的 - 当然不会

2790
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:29,280
- 永远 - 绝对不可能

2791
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:32,240
蓝妹妹永远都不可能欺骗我们大家的

2792
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,500
嘿 蓝妹妹

2793
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,040
你在蓝精灵村庄也和姐妹一起玩过这个吗？

2794
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,630
经常玩 但是 我一个姐妹都没有

2795
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,380
好了 现在有了

2796
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:45,050
- 想比赛吗？- 你想跟我比赛？

2797
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,720
那你听好了

2798
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:51,600
- 我要甩掉你了 蓝妹妹 - 不可能

2799
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,150
让路

2800
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,820
抓紧了 海库斯

2801
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,780
- 别这么紧 海库斯 - 对不起

2802
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:09,820
落阵仗

2803
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,200
飞过去

2804
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,740
真是太疯狂了

2805
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,420
飞吧 飞吧 尽情的飞

2806
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,420
海库斯乘鹤之王

2807
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:25,510
蓝妹妹 你玩赖

2808
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,380
这还是刚刚开始呢

2809
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:28,970
快 快

2810
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,050
这个叫做平锅 蓝妹妹

2811
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,810
再加上点蜗牛？

2812
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:37,980
- 主动进球 - 来吧

2813
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,190
使出你的绝招

2814
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:43,820
两发全中

2815
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,030
- 你很顽皮啊 蓝妹妹 - 吔

2816
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,620
嘿 我好像见过这位女士

2817
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,330
她可真漂亮

2818
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:58,460
不管走到哪 都能看到这个

2819
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,540
真想掐死那只鸭子

2820
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,670
维克多就像我头顶上的乌云

2821
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,130
好了 听着 我理解

2822
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,130
但你要知道 他就在这里

2823
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,550
无法回避

2824
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,510
对 无论你是高兴还是不高兴

2825
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,140
好吧 都说父母的出现 是给孩子最棒的礼物

2826
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,390
可是很多父亲却做不到

2827
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,310
他不是我的父亲

2828
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,390
好吧 那太糟糕了

2829
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,810
那意昧着 你就没有父亲啦

2830
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,830
- 帕特里克 - 好了 伙计们

2831
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,540
- 出发了 - 开始行动吧

2832
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,750
- 我和布鲁在家 - 还有维克多

2833
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,330
好的 孩子们 出发去格格巫的酒店

2834
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,960
帕特里克 实际上 我有一些话想跟你说

2835
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,130
没有实际上

2836
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,420
你待在这

2837
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:48,880
我想说的不是…

2838
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,630
维克多 别逼我 拔光了你

2839
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,130
- 我们走 - 行动吧

2840
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:56,100
我们一定要把蓝妹妹带回来 百分之百成功

2841
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,850
你刚才说什么 厌厌？

2842
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:03,020
你听见的 我厌倦了总是消极 我正在改变我的态度 变得积极

2843
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:05,060
从现在开始 我就是…

2844
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,650
预备？快乐的蓝精灵

2845
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,900
我的脸好像抽筋了

2846
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,450
慢慢就会习惯的 走吧 孩子们

2847
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,780
- 好了 快点 - 是个纸袋 头等舱

2848
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,740
- 快点… - 噢 笨笨

2849
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,200
祝你好运 爸爸

2850
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,160
一只尊贵的猫

2851
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,830
来吧 我带你去 你的房间

2852
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,800
- 你好 前台 - 给我听好了 你这个傻瓜

2853
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,970
格格巫先生

2854
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:39,810
我要啤酒 饮乳 熟肉 在10分钟之内送到我的房间

2855
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,230
要不然我就把你变成一只没腿的树獭

2856
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:47,020
怎么样？蓝精灵们？

2857
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,940
这一点也不好玩

2858
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:58,700
鸭子 鸭子鸭子

2859
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,700
天鹅

2860
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:07,080
电梯的安保卡怎么会在这 得去帮帮帕特里克

2861
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:13,510
等他见到我的时候就会明白我这边乌云可是…

2862
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,550
向赢边的

2863
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:30,570
噢 我的…

2864
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:32,110
温斯洛先生 别这样

2865
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:33,740
- 这里很难订位置的… - 专心点

2866
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,450
哦 闻起来真香啊

2867
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,660
真巧

2868
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:47,540
好了 伙计们 听着 进入房间的时候 如果有什么问题…

2869
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:52,300
- 到处都是粘液 真恶心 - 对不起 鱼先生

2870
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,460
脸都红了

2871
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,130
我说过了 如果遇到什么问题…

2872
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,260
朋友 绝不会有哪怕一丁点的问题

2873
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,970
反倒是有无限的机遇

2874
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,470
- 你吓我一跳 厌厌 - 是乐观

2875
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,180
好吧…

2876
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,400
好了 伙计们 进来了

2877
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,440
帕特里克 温斯洛到了

00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,110
帕特里克

2879
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,660
- 你在这里做什么 - 我来帮你脱险

2880
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,330
我这里有你需要完成任务的东西

2881
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:24,660
快点 没时间争论了

2882
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,870
- 什么东西？- 是乘坐电梯用的安保卡

2883
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,210
电梯的安保卡在这

2884
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:34,670
这是什么？这张是我们的房卡

2885
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:39,130
等你回来的时候就能进来

2886
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,550
- 决定没问题 - 我不能…

2887
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:41,970
不不不不…

2888
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,260
别客气

2889
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,430
不用急着感谢我

2890
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,020
哦 你是怎么跑出来的呢？

2891
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,440
你快把我放下来

2892
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,730
帕特里克 帮帮我

2893
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,570
- 客人还等着吃烤鸭呢 - 要切了吗？

2894
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,820
不不不不 那可绝对不行

2895
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,200
你现在能杀鸭子 以后肯定会杀人的

2896
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,660
- 真是难以置信 - 帕特里克

2897
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:05,490
温斯洛先生

2898
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,410
- 帕特里克 - 他去哪了？

2899
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:09,290
- 他不见了 - 我们只能靠自己

2900
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:10,790
- 好吧… - 藏起来

2901
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,130
格格巫先生

2902
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:22,430
这样麻烦了 还B计划吗？

2903
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:24,440
我正在努力保持着乐观

2904
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,150
格格巫先生？

你的客房服务到了

2908
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,030
- 现在怎么办？- 突然袭击 出其不意

2909
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:46,620
等等 笨

2910
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:49,660
- 哦 天哪 - 现在该做什么？

2911
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,080
装出很吓人的样子

2912
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,540
什么？

2913
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:56,090
我是个恐怖的精灵

2914
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:57,420
漂亮

2915
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,630
为什么蓝色的小精灵能够经历这么多的灾难啊

2916
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,640
乐观点 乐观点

2917
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,310
窗户窗户窗户

2918
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,020
噢 不

2919
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,190
该死的 你是在开玩笑吧 你差点害死…

2920
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:19,280
我只说 这风景可真美啊

2921
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:29,660
他看起来像只鸭子 走路也像只鸭子 而且闻起来像玉米热狗…

2922
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:31,870
好吧 到底哪只是维克多？

2923
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,790
什么？你竟然认不出你的父亲？

2924
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,880
- 我们走 - 这些兄弟怎么办？

2925
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,800
不能把他妈留在这里等着被吃掉

2926
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,210
你们只是初次见面

2927
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,300
相见就是缘分 我们不能扔下他们

2928
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,180
拜托 先把他妈救了吧

2929
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,560
我的身上简直脏透了

2930
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:55,060
好像被猫舔过一样

2931
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:59,900
哦 拜托 没那么糟糕吧

2932
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,280
尽管我没有… 啊 真是猫

2933
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:05,660

2934
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,370

- 击掌 - 击掌

2942
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:28,090
海库斯 海库斯 海库斯

2943
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,350
有个女孩一起玩 这感觉还真好

2944
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:33,930
你在干什么呢？

2945
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:37,020
我只是在拥抱你

2946
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,900
难道你没被拥抱过吗？

2947
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:45,110
维克茜

2948
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:52,870
- 海库斯抱抱 海库斯抱抱 - 海库斯

2949
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:54,790
海库斯 海库斯

2950
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,210
海库斯

2951
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:58,960
我觉得应该让它留在这里快一点

2952
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,040
谢谢

2953
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:04,260
也许 他们现在正在对蓝妹妹做着什么可怕的事情

2954
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,760
是啊 蓝妹妹很需要我们 也许她现在非常害怕

2955
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,350
- 我们是一家人 - 什么？

2956
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,220
她在干什么？

2957
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:15,310
我认为是拥抱

2958
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:16,560
爸爸？

2959
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,310
海库斯喜欢拥抱

2960
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:19,770
海库斯

2961
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:22,400
蓝妹妹 过来 我给你看样东西

2962
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,150
看看我们 告诉我们 我们不是一家人吗？

2963
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,950
蓝妹妹

2964
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:32,160
这边

2965
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,280
蓝妹妹

2966
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:36,410
很遗憾蓝爸爸没有来找你

2967
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:41,000
也许你的家就在这里我们在一起

2968
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,960
是啊

2969
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,590
也许是吧

2970
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:48,260
她为什么跟他们那么好呢？

2971
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:52,100
她这是认同了她的绑架者 典型的斯特哥尔摩综合症

2972
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:56,390
不 她认为我们不在乎她了 而他们在乎

2973
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,770
她被迷迷惑了

2974
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,150
笨笨 厌厌 爬上去帮助我把门打开

2975
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:02,310
- 我的女儿在里面 - 好的 爸爸

2976
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,530
- 我到把手上 - 好的 厌厌 你跳 我来拉

2977
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:08,070
- 加油 我们能做到 - 孩子们

2978
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,280
- 格格巫 - 不要松手

2979
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:13,200
啊 爸爸回来啦

2980
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:18,250
本性善良的好爸爸给你带了一件礼物

2981
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:19,580
厌厌 下来 别让他看见

2982
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,960
- 我们现在应该怎么解救她？- 安静

2983
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,750
亲爱的 我认为我们之间一定有误会

2984
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,880
这是怎么回事？

2985
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,720
我祝福你拥有一个非常非常快乐的生日？

2986
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:32,260
一切就似乎发生在昨天

2987
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:36,600
你还仅仅是我手中一小团粘土个其他腐败的配料

2988
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:40,390
你居然能记得我的生日？

2989
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,900
当然记得呀 我们是一家人了

2990
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,480
- 什么？- 可是我们才是她的家人

2991
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,360
- 她是不是认为我们抛弃她了？- 家人是不会忘记这种事情的

2992
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:51,070
说到这个这个话题你按蓝色的小继父好像还没回来是吧？

2993
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:52,490
继父？

2994
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:55,990
我真的感到才l每限遗憾 亲爱的 你的心肯定很疼

2995
00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:01,620
我还记得我父亲把我扔到井里第一次的时候

2996
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,920
他脸上那失望的表情啊

2997
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:07,960
当他看见我很艰难的从井里爬出来的时候

2998
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:12,130
不说了 生日快乐 亲爱的

2999
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:13,890
- 生日快乐 蓝妹妹 - 生日快乐 蓝妹妹

3000
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,470
- 我要打开 我要打开 - 哦 不不不

3001
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,850
真难看

3002
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:25,520
"鞠躬鞠躬 敬个礼"

3003
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:30,530
模仿的真像 真的

3004
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:32,780
再嘲笑我就把你变成一只斗鸡眼的娃娃鱼

3005
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,950
嗯 亲爱的

3006
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,530
拿起来看看

3007
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,870
这是专门给你定制的一柄小小的魔杖

3008
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,880
拿着吧 这是你的生日礼物

3009
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:51,880
不

3010
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,510
千万不要

3011
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,600
你喜欢它吗？

3012
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:02,270
我真傻 忘记激活它了

3013
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:05,100
嗯 好了

3014

01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,080
随便玩 今天是你的生日

3018
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,370
你怎么知道我不会用这个对付你？

3019
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:26,580
好吧…

3020
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:31,090
因为 蓝妹妹 我是你爸爸

3021
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:34,300
想想你的感觉 你就会知道这是真的

3022
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:37,010
- 她一定会杀了他 - 攻击他 蓝妹妹

3023
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,510
蓝妹妹

3024
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:40,510
给我唱首歌

3025
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:46,770
快唱

3026
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,230

3028
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:57,570

- 你以为你是马丁·路德飞？- 随便吧

3040
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:45,040

那是哥哥 什么？

3043
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:52,840
简直是侮辱蓝精灵 维克多马上就到

3044
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,880
打开精灵伞

3045

维克多的皮肤这么白啊

3049
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:04,560
别害怕

3050
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:06,390
我没有长大

3051
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:13,270
真是太好啦

3052
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,860
- 他是光着的 是吧？- 大家都还好吧？

3053
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:19,070
没事吧？救命 救命 来人啊 救救我

3054
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:24,580
我看见一个好恐怖的东西在下面

3055
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,660
但愿以后不要天天做噩梦

3056
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:31,040
蓝妹妹呢？

3057
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,000
- 她… - 蓝妹妹呢？

3058
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:38,760
已经太迟了

3059
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,050
干得漂亮

3060
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:49,770
尽情玩吧 孩子们 一定要记住 对人家要友好

3061
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:52,060
滚远点 你这个笨手笨脚的傻瓜

3062
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,810
- 蓝精灵来过？- 什么？

3063
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,730
蓝精灵们来过这里 那你怎么不说呀？

3064
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,480
我说了

3065
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:01,570
她肯定还不知道

3066
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:06,910
我们必须要带她离开这里 然后得到配方

3067
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:10,410
蓝妹妹 亲爱的 准备去庆祝生日吧

3068
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,160
- 吔 - 来吧 很有意思

3069
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:15,420
我们差点就把蓝妹妹救回来了

3070
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,500
我知道

3071
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:19,380
可他在关键时刻让我分心了 格蕾丝

3072
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,260
如果不是他 我不会错过电梯的

3073
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:24,090
好了 别那么大声 帕特里克 试着深呼吸

3074
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:25,850
希望他快点走

3075
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:28,720
- 他是你爸爸 - 不 他根本不是我爸爸

3076
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:31,100
他说的没错 我不是他爸爸

3077
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,650
他亲身爸爸离开他组建了新的家庭

3078
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:37,400
他一直解不开这个心结

3079
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:40,150
- 你在说什么？- 我理解你的感受

3080
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,820
但我 不希望你一直这样下去

3081
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:47,530
嘿 我可没求着你让你闯入我的生活 明白？

3082
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:51,540
也没请你和我妈妈结婚 更没有请你带走宙斯

3083
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:54,080
宙斯？那只鸽子？

3084
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,250
是鹦鹉

3085
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:57,920
是我的鹦鹉

3086
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,090
因为你过敏就把它送人了

3087
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,140
不是我对鹦鹉过敏

3088
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:07,470
是 就是你

3089
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,510
不是我

3090
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,640
是你

3091
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:13,640
什么？

3092
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:17,020
当时你每天都喘息 咳嗽 很严重

3093
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,570
你母亲和我都知道鹦鹉

3094
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:22,190
离开你会伤心欲绝的 因为你

3095
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:24,740
你的爸爸的事已经伤害了你

3096
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,070
所以才骗了你

3097
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:30,490
你在编故事 我怎么可能… 我对鸟类从来就不过敏

3098
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,910
来 试试

3099
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,500
闻闻这羽毛

3100
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:37,210
- 我才不闻呢… - 快点闻闻

3101
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,010
鼻子很痒是吧？

3102
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:51,970
听我说帕特里克

3103
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,350
我是真心爱你母亲的

3104
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,810
我尽心的照顾她 我努力的让她开心

3105
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,770
我也曾经想爱亲儿子一样的爱你

3106
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,360
其实我可以不那么做

3107
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:07,740
可你那么一点的孩子 却没了父亲 眼里全是绝望心里满是伤痕

3108
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:09,370
所以我努力的去疼你

3109
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,910
我做到了

3110
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:14,500
可是你并不想要 那好吧

3111
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
我对你的忠告就是

3112
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,170
成熟点？

3113
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:22,710
不要因为自己的痛苦去责怪别人

3114
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,000
不论你做什么

3115
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:27,720
千万别让你那漂亮的儿子觉得爱是有条件的

3116
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,680
因为爱是无条件的

3117
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:33,390
再见 格蕾丝

3118
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:40,060
再见 布鲁

3119
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,320
威斯特爷爷再见

3120
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,160
再见

3121
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:01,540
再见 帕特里克·温斯洛

3122
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,430
快看 大轮子

3123
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:17,310
哦 过来 跟我来 亲爱的

3124
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,690
这就是大家都叫它光之城的原因

3125
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:23,400
这里好多人哦

3126
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:25,520
是啊 其实

3127
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:28,860
我更喜欢叫他们崇拜者

3128
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:30,360
"崇拜者"

3129
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,950
阿拉塔

3130
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,120
跪下

3131
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,410

- 怎么样？- 走吧

3133
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:45,960
别担心 他们都喜欢这样 他是大明星

3134
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:47,300
好吧

3135
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,760
真好 是我

3136
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,430

3138
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,260

01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,930

3140
01:07:58,310 --> 01:07:59,770
嗨

01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:02,810

3143

3144
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:07,610

3145
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,490

3146
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:11,650
拜拜

3147
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:14,820
过来 孩子们 这边走

3148
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:17,990
格格巫先生 格格巫先生

3149
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,910
快来啊

3150
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,250
- 爸爸 - 等会儿

3151
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:23,750
吃饭时间到了

3152
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:25,750
- 等一会 - 但是

3153
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,000
我们到了

3154
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:33,760
- 好戏刚刚才开始 对吗？- 吔

3155
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:37,140
阿拉塔 转起来

3156
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:45,560
是不是感觉很有趣啊 亲爱的

3157
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:47,820
想想看

3158
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:52,280
设想一下秘方和我不可思议的魔法

3159
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:56,370
天底下还有什么事我们做不到的呢？

3160
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,280
是的

3161
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:02,500
想象我们将拥有的乐趣吧 蓝妹妹

3162
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,250
好吧

3163
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:12,800
我们为什么不能转的快点呢？

3164
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,820
- 注意 - 吔

3165
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,490
这样更好玩吧？

3166
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:38,160
一点都不好玩

3167
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:52,250
这真是太好玩了 蓝妹妹 太棒了

3168
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,470
来了

3169
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:03,270
当心下面啊 摩天轮来了哦

3170
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,730
抱歉

3171
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:26,120
是我让她失望了

3172
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:30,790
抱歉 我只是 想一个人静一静

3173
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,550
不不不 没什么的

3174
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:36,300
我也是在反思我自己呢

3175
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:42,930
温斯洛先生 这对我很难

3176
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:46,430
不过你能给我一些建议吗？

3177
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,480
因为 你也是个父亲

3178
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,310
是关于蓝妹妹的

3179
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,820
我不知道该怎么做

3180
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:56,110
我把她变蓝了

3181
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:58,990
教给她爱 和善良

3182
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:01,990
但实际上是格格巫制造了她

3183
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:06,120
只要她愿意 她随时可以是个蓝精灵

3184
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,540
但是 如果她不愿意呢

3185
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:12,420
如果她选择了格格巫

3186
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,670
我们不能失去她

3187
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,670
也许已经失去她了

3188
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:20,300
也许我做的还不够

3189
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,760
你开玩笑吧？

3190
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:24,300
格格巫只是制造了她

3191
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,760
但是你 你给了她新的生命

3192
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:28,730
你关心她爱她像对自己的孩子一样

3193
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:31,020
没人要求你 但你这样做了

3194
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:33,610
因为你知道她想要这些

3195
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,820
这是…

3196
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,910
这是一种非常特殊的爱

3197
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:46,700
她那么聪明她一定会想明白的

3198
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:50,960
嗯 说的对

3199
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,710
是我们的信任让她变成了蓝精灵

3200
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:56,170
而改变 又让我们产生了担忧

3201
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,630
谢谢你 温斯洛先生

3202
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,050
你的话让我心里豁然开朗

3203
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:13,400
我也是

3204
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:17,270
这有几个泡泡

3205
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,900
这个算吗？

3206
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:22,240
哦 真是臭死人了 你都吃了些什么呀？

3207
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,740
不至于吧？每次我放屁的时候都会有人笑的

3208
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:27,990
- 该出发了 孩子们 - 去哪儿

3209
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,240
去带蓝妹妹回家

3210
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:31,160
但是您看到了 爸爸

3211
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:33,170
她现在已经改变了

3212
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:35,000
- 变成木马人了？- 不

3213
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,040
- 加入社会党了？- 不

3214
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:38,250
啊 是空中飞人

3215
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,130
变成捣蛋鬼了 别打岔

3216
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:42,010
不管我们看到了什么

3217
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:44,430
我们永远都不能放弃我们的家人

3218
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:46,430
对 爸爸说的对

3219
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:48,810
你是谁？你和厌厌到底什么关系？

3220
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:51,020
嘿 我的保持乐观 忘了吗？

3221
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,140
好吧 孩子们 我们去找蓝妹妹吧

3222
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,270
温斯洛先生 你也一起去吗？

3223
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,940
蓝精灵的屁股是蓝色的？

3224
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:02,440
你自己看嘛

3225
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,030
厌厌

3226
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,030
- 注意点影响 - 还有人看吗？

3227
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:09,740
好了没有？快出来吧

3228
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:10,910
- 我们要准备开工啦 - 嘿

3229
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:13,120
都打起精神来 出发了

3230
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:15,370
对 伙伴们 开始行动吧

3231
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:25,430
维克多？你好

3232
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,040
好的 温斯洛先生 我们分头行动吧

3233
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:58,290
好的 我去找到供电室 切掉电源

3234
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,500
我们去找蓝妹妹

3235
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,670
我们会英俊潇洒的做好事情的

3236
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:03,340
哦 拜托

3237
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:05,380
团队形象 明白吗？

3238
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:08,010
好吧 里面见 好运

3239
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:10,010
- 走吧 伙伴们 - 我们去虎口拔牙

3240
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:14,640
我们来这里做什么 爸爸？

3241
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:18,690
来给你这个有点认生的姐姐庆祝生日啊

3242
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:19,770
真的？

3243
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,270
没有蛋糕怎么算是完整的生日呢？

3244
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,190
一个蛋糕

3245
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,700
这是你最喜欢的 我的蓝色的小可爱

3246
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:32,490
蛋糕

3247
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:36,620
来吧来吧 许个愿 亲爱的

3248
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:41,250
无论什么 只要你的小脑袋能想的到的 都会变成现实

3249
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,050
无论什么？

3250
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:44,420
当然了

3251
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:46,880
前提是我力所能及

3252
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:51,220
因为最近我的精灵精华使用的有点超预算了

3253
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:54,720
要不然我也不会跟你要配方 是吧？

3254
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,230
哦 她在那

3255
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,280
那是她的生日蛋糕吗？

3256
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,240
我们也给她准备了一个生日蛋糕

3257
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,820
只不过 她根本就没有看见

3258
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:12,870
他们看起来像是幸福的一家人

3259
01:15:12,950 --> 01:15:15,290
她是不会给他配方的

3260
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:18,960
对吧 爸爸？如果她给了那就意昧着整个精灵族的灭亡

3261
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,670
等等 包括最帅的那个吗？

3262
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:24,750
- 当然 - 福福 你跟我来

3263
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,090
笨笨和厌厌去跟温斯洛先生会合

3264
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:40,190
维克多 你来干嘛？

3265
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:41,390
格蕾丝说

3266
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,610
你可能需要帮助

3267
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,320
哦 不不 维克多 等等

3268
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,910
其实格蕾丝说的对

3269
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:53,910
我的确需要帮助

3270
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:57,660
我认为你应该打开供电井盖

3271
01:15:57,740 --> 01:15:59,160
除非 你想检查电话线

3272
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,960
蓝妹妹 配方呢？

3273
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:08,920
抓紧一切时间考虑考虑

3274
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:10,720
亲爱的 只是时间实在不多了

3275
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,720
我们就都可以变蓝了 在一起

3276
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,100
海库斯要变蓝 海库斯要变蓝

3277
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,220
看到了吗 他想变蓝

3278
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,480
就像他们的姐姐一样

3279
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:24,650
那么 我们就真的是一家人了

3280
01:16:29,070 --> 01:16:30,990
这个配方

3281
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:35,370
是一份珍贵的礼物也是对我的信任

3282
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:39,830
对不起

3283
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,710
我不能…

3284
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:45,500
把它给你

3285
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:50,920
什么意思？你不能？

3286
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:52,340
我给了你一切

3287
01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:54,550
善良 礼物

3288
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,760
一个没有毒的蛋糕 你就这样对待我么

3289
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:00,560
现在我受够了 年轻的小姐

3290
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,440
你必须马上把配方交出来

3291
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,850
- 马上交出来 - 不

3292
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:05,940

3293
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:07,360
- 爸爸？- 什么 什么 什么？

3294
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:12,320
海库斯头晕

3295
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,990
他们这是怎么了？

3296
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:15,410
头晕

3297
01:17:15,490 --> 01:17:18,950
别告诉我你真的很在乎这些悲哀的东西

3298
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:20,290
瞧瞧你多伤心呐

3299
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:26,210
真是上天赐给我一个绝妙的机会

3300
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:27,960
好像这条才是电线

3387
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:01,070
多么肉麻的一幕啊

3388
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:03,820
如果这不是我人生中最开心的时刻

3389
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:06,910
我会被你们恶心的吐出胆汁来

3390
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:09,070
- 门控制杆 大的那个 - 踩着我的肩膀

3391
01:22:09,370 --> 01:22:10,830
小伙子 快点

3392
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:11,950
该往那边掰？

3393
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,950
往负极 就是断电

3394
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,870
负极 哦 不 我是积极乐观的

3395
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:21,210
哪里

3396
01:22:21,290 --> 01:22:25,260
这仅仅是一个巫师的一小部分

3397
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:28,340
但对我来说 却是… 什么？

3398
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:30,680
我是正极

3399
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:33,310
好沉的浆果馅饼

3400
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,600
厌厌

3401
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:37,770
哦 对了 我说过 让你来按下按钮

3402
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:42,110
厌厌

3403
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:44,360
骗你的 这是我的一大步

3404
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,740
我被电到了

3405
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:53,200
保持乐观可真不容易啊

3406
01:22:58,370 --> 01:22:59,540
啊 真是气死我了

3407
01:22:59,710 --> 01:23:00,710
快点 福福

3408
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:04,050
看看自恋狂是怎么带你们脱险的

3409
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:05,670
- 开了 - 干的漂亮

3410
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,010
- 当然 - 快走

3411
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:08,550
- 什么？- 走

3412
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,930
快点 阿兹猫

3413
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:14,310
幸亏我有宇宙能量作为备用电源

3414
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:15,810
关键时刻我的运气总那么好？

3415
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:18,430
- 这边 - 瞧瞧我 多帅气的身手

3416
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,480
简直就是蓝精灵特战队员

3417
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,770
嘘

3418
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:25,360
哦 你说的对 特战队应该悄悄的行动

3419
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:26,940
遵命

3420
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:28,490
- 你看 她在那 - 蓝妹妹

3421
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:30,820
圣诞老人

3422
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:34,280
爸爸？你…你来救我了

3423
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:37,700
哦 我当然会来救你的 你是我的女儿

3424
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:39,580
这有什么好怀疑的呢？

3425
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:41,370
- 锁上了 - 你们钻进去

3426
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:42,670
- 我们去找别的路 - 好吧

3427
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:45,210
好的 里面会合 温斯洛先生 快点

3428
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:49,880
这里

3429
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:51,840
好了 挂上去

3430
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:09,860
哦 爸爸

3431
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:12,110
哦 亲爱的

3432
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:16,450
爸爸 我把配方给了格格巫

3433
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,200
但是她救了我们

3434
01:24:18,370 --> 01:24:20,830
海库斯还活着 海库斯还活着

3435
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:23,790
哦 爸爸 我让您失望了

3436
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:27,050
我 背叛了蓝精灵

3437
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:28,630
我真的很抱歉

3438
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,720
哦 蓝妹妹 只有生命才是最值得我们保护的

3439
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,890
我为你感到骄傲

3440
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:37,930
你…真的？

3441
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:41,020
真的吗？不打屁股 连手板也不打一下

3442
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,140
难道就这样原谅她了吗？

3443
01:24:43,390 --> 01:24:46,730
当然了 因为爱会让我们变得很强大

3444
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:50,110
失去爱也就失去了所有的希望

3445
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:53,860
真的好感动 我又要哭了

3446
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,660
嗨 小蓝妹妹

3447
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,530
哦 你好啊

3448
01:24:58,580 --> 01:24:59,620
嗨

3449
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:02,750
我们没有时间了

3450
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,210
我们得赶快抢回配方 离开这个鬼地方

3451
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:07,920
等等 他们怎么办？

3452
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:10,050
他们怎么办？他们绑架了你

3453
01:25:10,130 --> 01:25:11,420
他们是格格巫的人

3454
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:16,050
我也一样 但是 爸爸从来没放弃我

3455
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:18,510
所以 我也不能丢下他们不管

3456
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:21,470
除非你认为自己不是真正的蓝精灵

3457
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:24,350
- 带他们出去 快点 - 好的 爸爸

3458
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,020
海库斯自由了

3459
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:28,610
又来了四个？

3460
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:31,150
你好 猫咪

3461
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,860
欢迎参加聚会 爸爸

3462
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,820
哦 瞧瞧这些小宝贝

3463
01:25:40,490 --> 01:25:43,620
我爱你们做的事 我爱死你们了

3464
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:46,540
真的太可爱了 尤其你们这蓝色的样子

3465
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:50,040
我们快变成肉酱了

3466
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:52,460
快住手 格格巫

3467
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:53,970
够你用的啦

3468
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:58,800
是的是的 但你看 蓝爸爸 我还想更多的呢

3469
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:05,060
海库斯好疼啊 我现在能让它发挥作用了

3470
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:10,150
我叫它 拉旺达

3471
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:13,530
你以为它是个魔杖

3472
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:15,400
所以我叫它拉旺达 多有意思啊

3473
01:26:15,490 --> 01:26:19,320
如果你不正难受着 肯定也会为我高兴的

3474
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:27,460
相信我 可是我有这么多能量 到底用来干什么呢？

3475
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,590
哦 我想到了

3476
01:26:30,670 --> 01:26:34,010
用这些能量 我可以统治全世界

3477
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:35,590
不

3478
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:37,510
哦 还有蓝爸爸

3479
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:40,470
我忘告诉你我的第一个正式行动

3480
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:42,370
我要创造一个入口

3481
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:47,310
直接从那到我这儿到达蓝精灵村

3482
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:51,730
这样就可以让所有的蓝精灵来这里陪你啦

3483
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:55,360
是永远

3484
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:56,570
我可不这么想 格格巫

3485
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:01,820
就这样

3486
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:03,120
- 快来 让我来 - 快啊

3487
01:27:04,370 --> 01:27:06,200
他就要拿到魔杖了

3488
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,920
- 快点把它砸开 - 我这么帅可不能死啊

3489
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:13,840
以精灵之爱的名义

3490
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,090
别光站在那儿吼我 快打碎它

3491
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:18,340
开啦

3492
01:27:25,010 --> 01:27:26,310
阿拉塔…

3493
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:15,770
我肚子好疼口阿

3494
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,360
我们又被扔出来啦

3495
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:20,190
当心 笨笨

3496
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,990
- 每一次 - 对不起

3497
01:28:22,150 --> 01:28:23,200
真的？

3498
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,450
击掌

3499
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:36,500
都没事吧？

3500
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:38,750
所有的精灵 一个都不少

3501
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:41,090

- 保持乐观？- 嘿 离我远点

3534
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:01,920
我从来不玩这个

3535
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,340
我是厌厌 我的天性就是愤怒和讨厌

01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:24,800
- 太棒了蓝妹妹 太棒了 - 好样的 蓝妹妹

3552
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,300
真是太奇妙了

3553
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:28,220
现在可以暂时摆脱格格巫了

3554
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:30,130
我们回家吧 一起回家

3555
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:31,340
- 好的 - 回家

3556
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:33,970
我们还有一个很小的问题

3557
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:35,810
我只剩下五颗水晶了

3558
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:39,560
我要说 一个蓝精灵都不能少

3559
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:42,690
哇 蓝妹妹

3560
01:31:42,770 --> 01:31:45,230
你把魔杖用的出神入化啊

3561
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:47,650
这是我天生的能力

3562
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:49,740
曾经非常困扰我

3563
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,740
但是 就像一位伟大的人告诉我的

3564
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:55,160
你来自哪里并不重要

3565
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:59,080
重要的是你想要做什么样的人

3566
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:01,170
这才是我的女儿

3567
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:03,420
您是我们的爸爸

3568
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:06,500
谢谢您给了我们一个新的住所

3569
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:08,920
一个新的家庭

3570
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:10,550
您真的是一个好爸爸

3571
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:12,930
你也会是个好精灵

3572
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:14,600
我会想你们的

3573
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,220
可以用他们命名热狗

3574
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:18,970
哦 这主意不错 可以用蓝玉米来做

3575
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:20,640
蓝精灵热狗 吔

3576
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:22,440

一路顺风 伙伴们

3578

3587
01:32:51,630 --> 01:32:53,630

- 嗨 伙计们 - 真是太好了

3593
01:33:13,650 --> 01:33:15,820
我们的大家庭又添新成员

3594
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:17,870
伙伴们 这位就是维克茜

3595
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:20,700
- 哦 - 她真是个小美人

3596
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:21,830

3597
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,580
- 嗨… - 嗨 我是蓝蓝

3598
01:33:23,660 --> 01:33:26,750
嗨 我是蓝蓝 你喜欢吃蛋糕吗？

3599
01:33:30,090 --> 01:33:31,590
- 哎呀 - 怎么呢？

3600
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:32,880
我差点被吓尿裤子

3601
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:34,340
海库斯

3602
01:33:34,430 --> 01:33:36,510
海库斯 他们是你的新兄弟

3603
01:33:37,010 --> 01:33:38,680
啊 有新兄弟啦

3604
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:40,560
抱一抱

3605
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:41,930
听我说一句

3606
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:43,270
从法律上来讲

3607
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:46,100
根据蓝精灵规章第六条 宗系的合法性 像这种生物…

3608
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:47,730
嘿 踢他一脚

3609
01:33:47,810 --> 01:33:49,690
- 这种生物不能… - 吃海库斯一脚

3610
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,900
- 吔 - 这小子有个性

3611
01:33:51,980 --> 01:33:53,030
他跟我们一样

3612
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:58,030
所以在耐心的等待之后 主题再一次浮现

3613
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:02,370
我们的故事大王荣耀回归 发挥主导作用

3614
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:04,250
他特别提醒大家 我们上次见面的时候

3615
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:07,370
整个村庄正忙成一团 他们精心的准备着

3616
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:09,290
嗨 这些装饰是怎么回事？

3617
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:12,840
生日快乐 蓝妹妹

3618
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:15,880
能安静点吗？故事马上就要结束了

3619
01:34:15,970 --> 01:34:18,140
- 从此… - 嗨 开始狂欢吧

3620
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:22,810
但是音乐却压过了叙述的声音

3621
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:24,930
献给我新的大家庭

3622
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:00,820

3624
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,870
你别想溜？过来陪我

3625
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:23,200
你怎么能这么说我？我什么都没做错

3626
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:26,700

3628
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:34,330
你想要客房服务吗 为啥不朝窗外喊叫？

3629
01:44:36,170 --> 01:44:40,420
阿兹猫先生 难道你只有在用爪子的时候才秀出来吗？

3630
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:43,840
阿兹猫 阿兹猫 阿兹猫

3631
01:44:44,050 --> 01:44:46,350
