Top Gear-完美公路之旅

1
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,919
克拉克森：这是英国一个寻常的周二
CLARKSON:It's a normal Tuesday in Britain.

2
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,479
天空伴随着些许小雨，交通已近乎瘫痪
There's a hint of drizzle in the air and traffic is at a standstill.

3
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,199
我们知道驾驶的意义远不像我们看到的这般无趣
We know that driving is meant to be more fun than this.

4
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,959
我们也同样希望汽车应该做些比这更有乐趣的事情
We know that cars are meant to be more fun than this.

5
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,839
因此我们决定做点什么能让您暂时摆脱这混乱的现实世界
So we decided what we'd do is give you an hour or so of escapism,

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,839
以给予您一个小时的完美公路驾驶之旅
of perfect roads and perfect cars.

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,919
没错。所以我们将要做的是
Yeah. So, what we're going to do is

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,439
抛开所有这些让人抓狂的交通状况
strip away all the things that drive us mad,

9
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,759
道路施工，标致汽车，限速摄像头...
roadworks, Peugeots, speed cameras...

10
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,199
-詹姆士·梅。-没错，我们要远离他
-James May. -Yeah, we'll get rid of him.

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,679
他总是拖我们的后腿
He's always holding us up.

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,559
最后我们会以一次完美的公路之旅结束本次节目
And then we will end up with the perfect road trip.

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,999
哈蒙德：意外的是杰瑞米坚持认为本次旅程的起点应该选在这里，威尼斯
Hammond：strangely，Jeremy insisted we should start here，in Venice

14
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,359
一个以水代路的地方
where all the streets are fuLL of wster.

15
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,039
为啥我们要来威尼斯？
Why are we in Venice?

16
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,599
因为我想驾驶丽娃aquariva
(意大利顶级游艇品牌丽娃推出的高速游艇aquariva，)。
Because I wanted to drive the Riva Aquariva。

17
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,719
为什么？
Why?

18
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,159
因为它是有史以来人类制造的最精美交通工具
Because it's the most beautiful thing ever made

19
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,279
并且它还配备了两台V8引擎
and because it's got two V8s.

20
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,679
好吧，我们从威尼斯开始本次旅程因为他想驾驶...这玩意叫啥来着？
Okay, we are starting in Venice because he wanted to drive a... What is it?

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,679
-丽娃Aquariva。-丽娃Aquariva。
-Riva Aquariva.-Riva Aquariva.

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,919
-有史以来最漂亮的交通工具。-有史以来最漂亮的交通工具。
-The most beautiful thing ever made.-The most beautiful thing ever made

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,079
并且还搭载了...两台V8引擎？
and it's got... Two V8s?

24
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,999
-两台V8.-两台V8！
-Two V8s.-Two V8s!

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,639
并且我们将从这里出发，开启一段横跨意大利，
And we're going to set off from here on a journey across Italy,

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,159
横跨法国的旅程，去到...我们要去哪？
across France, to... Where are we going?

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,399
-波城。-去波城...波城？（波城，法国西南部城市，避寒胜地）
-Pau. -To Pau... Pau?

28
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,079
为啥我们要去波城？
Why are we going to Pau?

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,759
因为那里是第一届欧洲汽车大奖赛举办的地方
Because that is where the first ever Grand Prix was held.

30
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,959
-波城？-没错。
-Pau? -Yeah.

31
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,119
-从未听说。-老赛道还保留在那。
-Never heard of it.-The track's still there.

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,639
我们将去第一届欧洲大奖赛的举办地体验驾驶乐趣
We're going to drive the very first Grand Prix track.

33
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,879
不管怎样。从这里到波城，我们会经历高速公路，
Whatever. Between here and there,we're going to be on motorways,

34
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,199
盘山公路，拉力赛道，专业赛车场，以及城市道路的挑战
mountain roads, rally stages,racetracks and cities.

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,399
并且在每一处地点，我们都会选择
And in every place, we are both going to pick what we believe

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,639
我们认为最完美的交通方式
is the perfect mode of transport.

37
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,519
我们会度过一周完美的旅程
It's going to be the perfect week.

38
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,239
完美的天气，完美的起点，完美的游艇，完美的一切！
Perfect weather, perfect start,perfect boat, perfect everything!

39
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,999
-完美。-并且没有詹姆士·梅的存在
-Perfect.-And no James May.

40
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,239
这点比完美更重要
That's better than perfect.

41
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,439
克拉克森：在接下来追寻完美的七天旅程中，
CLARKSON: Over the next seven dsys,our quest for perfection

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,719
我们会从威尼斯前往意大利湖
wouLd tske us from Venice towsrds the italian lakes.

43
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,119
再从那里沿着法国的蔚蓝海岸线
From there we'd head south to the Mediterranean,

44
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,639
直奔地中海度假胜地圣特罗佩
（圣特罗佩：毗邻嘎纳、摩纳哥，法国著名度假海港小镇）
for a drive aLong the French Riviera to Saint-Tropez.

45
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,959
最后我们回转至内陆去往本次旅程的终点波城
Then we'd swing inland again towsrds the finishing point st Psu.

46
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,159
我们看起来像不像塔布斯和克罗克特？
（美国电视犯罪系列剧迈阿密风云里的人物）
Do we look like Tubbs and Crockett?

47
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,919
或者一对傻胖子和小搞怪？
Or Tubby and Crotchety?

48
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,359
-别，认真点。真的很完美。-傻胖子和小搞怪。
-No, seriously. That's perfect, though. -Tubby and Crotchety.

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,839
威尼斯风云（调侃迈阿密风云-Miami Vice）
Venice Vice.

50
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,679
克拉克森：把价值20万欧元的游艇泊好后
CLARKSON: Having docked the £200,000 speedbost,

51
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,159
我为自己挑选了一辆更昂贵的座驾
I switched to an even more expensive car.

52
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,519
更加成熟、车尾一点也不躁动的新款奔驰SLS黑色运动版跑车
The new, grown-up, Less taiL-hsppy Black edition of the SLS.

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,879
在维多利亚时代，人们会以“尊贵奢华的泛欧大陆游”方式
In Victorian times,people would come through Venice

54
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,039
前往威尼斯旅行
on what was called "the grand tour",

55
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,599
这就是为什么我选择了这款奔驰的原因
so that's why I've gone for the Mercedes,

56
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,759
因为它是游览欧洲大陆的终极豪华交通工具
because it is the ultimate grand tourer.

57
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,079
嗯哼。你的奔驰还不是最终极的选择，因为我挑选了这辆法拉利F12.
Mmm-hmm. Except, it isn't the ultimate because this is, the Ferrari F12.

58
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,879
不，不。你的这辆马力太大了
No, no. That's too powerful.

59
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,119
-马力太大？ -是的马力过大。
-Too powerful? -It is too powerful.

60
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,479
我说过了，它...是的！
I said that... It is!

61
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,919
你居然在节目上说这种话，你让我...（傻笑）
You did say it on the programme and I thought then... (LAUGHS)

62
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,039
你了解这点吗？我能用到这辆车的所有动力
You see this? I will be able to use all of the power.

63
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,119
然后呢？
Yes?

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,079
也就是说你不能用尽你法拉利的全部动力
In that, you will not be able to use all of the power

65
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,119
因为你会和一根电线杆亲密接触，然后结束掉你本次的自驾之旅
because you'll end up halfway up a telegraph pole.

66
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,879
不，我会用到我全部的动力
No, I'll be able to all of the power

67
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,159
以及比你多得多的动力，这就是关键所在
but there will be more power than you've got, that's all that's about.

68
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,759
一次奢华的泛欧大陆游需要搭配强大的动力
A grand tourer should be powerful

69
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,919
-以及全身涂抹奶油身材火辣的女郎和...-呃...
-and creamy and grunty and... -Uh...

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,919
这货有622匹的强劲动力，这可不是一辆手推车
Six hundred and twenty-two horsepower,it's not a wheelbarrow.

71
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,719
-我这货有730马力！比你大 -我知道。
-Seven hundred and thirty! It's more. -I know.

72
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,079
哈蒙德！
Hammond!

73
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,239
让我们穿越意大利，行吗，开始我们的完美之旅
Let's just go across Italy, shall we,in our grand tourers?

74
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,279
好吧，好吧
Yes. Yes.

75
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,999
我的车会快得让你这货看起来像个娘炮
I'll go quickly, you big girl.

76
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,559
（狼嚎）
(SCREAMING)

77
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,719
（傻笑）噢，天啊！
(LAUGHING) Oh, God!

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,439
噢，这动力真是太强劲了！
Oh, that's a lot of power!

79
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,639
可能太强劲了点！不，还不算太强。
Maybe that's too much!No, it's not too much.

80
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,079
杰瑞米这回成了胆小鬼。他的只是足够而已
Jeremy's being a wuss. It's just enough.

81
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,999
实际上现在我不需要用到全部动力，
It's just I don't need to use all of it right now.

82
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,519
我只需要用到一点点，大概只有这么多
I'm going to use a bit less.Maybe this much of it.

83
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,679
换档速度简直惊人
The changes from that gearbox are incredible.

84
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,839
这车配备了一台双离合变速器。事实上
It's a double clutch gear box.In actual fact,

85
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,399
这货和杰瑞米的那台SLS的变速箱没啥区别
it's exactly the same unit as in Jeremy's Mercedes SLS.

86
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,679
只是法拉利装上了自家特有的
It's just Ferrari have put their own mapping,

87
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,039
控制单元匹配这台特殊的变速箱而已
their own computer control on this particular one.

88
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,639
所有参数都已被设定好，当你换档时
And it's set up so that when you change,

89
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,159
它会控制引擎转速使得动力汹涌而来
it spikes the engine revs so it surges when you change.

90
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,959
天啊！
Dear God!

91
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,559
这样的车身不只是好看那么简单
This body isn't just pretty,

92
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,599
它被雕琢成这样用来最大限度压榨下压力
it's been sculpted to maximise the air flowing over it to generate down force

93
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,619
以便把车身吸附在地面上
to stick it to the road.

94
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,079
奔驰过去制造过很多黑色系列车型
There have been a number of Black Special Edition Mercs in the past

95
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,679
所有黑色版本都一个鸟样，非常可怕，确实如此。不可驾驭
and almost all of them have been,well, dreadful, really. Undriveable.

96
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,239
它们都有一个通病那就是扭矩过大。所以每当你踩下油门
They generated too much torque.So every time you put your foot down,

97
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,719
那感觉就像它们想把自己撕成碎片
it felt like they were trying to tear themselves apart.

98
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,039
你会赞同我的这种说法，感觉就像它会把前方的一切事物
You'd be going along and it'd be sucking birds

99
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,439
比如鸟啊，树啊，松鼠啊之类的东西吸进引擎
and trees and squirrels into the engine

100
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,919
在撕碎道路的同时疯狂排出柏油和沥青的碎片
and then ripping up the road and hurling chunks of tarmac out of the back

101
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,719
那感觉简直就是...不可理喻
and it was just... They were ridiculous.

102
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,319
但这回，梅赛德斯终于变聪明了
This, though, Mercedes has been clever

103
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,279
因为，没错，它的马力确实比标准版SLS更大
because, yes, it generates more power than a standard SLS

104
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,239
但是扭矩却降低了11牛米。所以现在...
but 1 1 fewer torques. So now...

105
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,119
当你踩下油门，它会把这个动作全部转变成增长的车速
You put your foot down, it translates that action into speed,

106
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,199
而不再是破坏。
not destruction.

107
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,159
噢，你是不可能击败这台V8的！
Oh, but you can't beat a V8!

108
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,799
我想说，是的，那台V12确实很不错。但是这台V8更优秀
I mean, yes, a V12 is nice.But a V8 is nicer.

109
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,519
这是事实
It just is.

110
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,639
我刚说你不可能击败这台V8
I'm just ssying you can't best s V8.

111
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,279
喔，我喜欢V12，我就是喜欢一台庞大强劲，又带一点点躁动的V12
Oh,I like V12,I do like a big powerful,slightly angry 12.

112
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,979
（羡艳的笑声）那确实是一辆好车。
(LAUGHS) That's a great car, that.

113
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,159
（偷笑）这真是...你只是简单的轻点油门
(CHUCKLES) It's...You just give it a little poke,

114
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,839
“抱歉，打扰一下，请问能不...啊！”（尖叫）
"Excuse me, could you..." (SCREAMS)

115
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,279
这车真是太疯狂了！
That is insane!

116
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,159
哈蒙德：我真是太兴奋了
HAMMOND: I was veryhappy.

117
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,519
随后，让我感到意外的杰瑞米突然驶向了一个
And therefore s bit surprised when Jeremy suddenly veered off

118
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,919
古老的意大利小镇
towsrd some oLd ItsLisn town.

119
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,919
（教堂钟声）
(BELL TOLLING)

120
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,279
就是这里了
There it is.

121
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,279
-什么？那个？-是的
-What? That?-Yeah.

122
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,439
那就是罗密欧和朱丽叶里那个著名的阳台
That is the actual balcony from Romeo and JuLiet.

123
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,319
-好吧。我有几点想说。-什么？
-Yeah. Couple of points.-What?

124
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,119
我驾驶着一辆法拉利，在这样一个美好的天气，身处意大利
I've got a Ferrari,it's a beautiful day, I'm in Italy.

125
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,919
你却傻望着一个故事里虚构的阳台发呆...故事里的！
You're looking at a balcony that was in a story... Story!

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,199
而且你说过对莎士比亚从来都不感冒
Made up by a man who you said you don't like.

127
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,399
我确实不喜欢莎士比亚，但这里是...看啊！
I hate William Shakespeare but it's...Come on!

128
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,679
这不是真的，这只是个故事。一切都是虚构的
It's not real, it's a story.It was pretend.

129
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,239
你在进行一次欧洲游，你要见识一些名胜
You're on a tour of Europe,you need to see stuff.

130
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,479
我是在进行一次欧洲游，在一辆法拉利里，
I'm on a tour of Europe, in a Ferrari,

131
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,879
但我现在却没在驾驶法拉利
except I'm not in a Ferrari,

132
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,359
我现在站在这对着一座破房子发傻
I'm standing here looking at an old building.

133
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,879
幸运的是，一大群意大利top gear粉丝把杰瑞米团团围住
Happily, a big crowd of ItaLian Top Gear fans then stopped him

134
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,519
让他不能一览某座剧院的风采，这使得我们又回到了旅途中来
from getting into some oLd theatre so we couLd get back on the motorwsy.

135
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,479
如果因为杰瑞米去看某个傻大粗的意大利破房子
If he's going to ruin this road trip

136
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,799
而破坏了这次旅行，那我真的会...
by stopping off to look at old things that don't move, I'll...

137
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,279
克拉克森：我应该牢记这一点的，当然
CLARKSON: I should've remembered, of course,

138
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,479
哈蒙德对任何人文的事物都不感冒
Hammond isn't going to want to do anything cultural

139
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,079
而且他也对任何有意思的美食不感兴趣
and he isn't going to want to eat anything interesting.

140
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,759
感觉像和一个老年痴呆一起旅行似的
It's like travelling around with a garden chair.

141
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,679
于是我决定再调戏他一番
I therefore decided to annoy him some more.

142
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,479
-哈蒙德？-又有啥事？
-Hammond?-What?

143
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,119
我们从这里拐出去吧？
Shall we turn off here?

144
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,199
什么，现在？为啥又要拐出去？
What, now? Why would we?

145
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,999
因为我厌倦了在高速上傻走直线，我想换条路走走
Well, because I'm bored of driving on motorways,
I want to go on other roads.

146
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,159
你是想去看另一堆破砖烂瓦
Is there an old pile of bricks

147
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,159
或者神话故事里的无聊东西吗？
or a gate that once featured in a fairy tale down here?

148
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,719
不，不。我只是想找条更有趣的路而已
No, no.It's driving but just on nice roads.

149
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,479
我们不会再看些奇幻古堡之类的东西了吧？
We're not going to look at Hansel and Gretel's handbag or something?

150
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,959
克拉克森：事实上，我们正前往意大利湖
CLARKSON: In fsct, we were heading for the ItaLian Lakes,

151
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,519
这是一颗闪耀在我们这次旅途王冠上的璀璨明珠
a sparkLing jeweL in the goLden crown of our perfect journey.

152
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,039
很快我意识到今天的这车和这天气似曾相识
And soon I reaLised that cars Like these on days Like these

153
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,519
没错，正和意大利任务那期的情况一样
have been used before,at the beginning of The Italian Job.

154
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,999
我意识到应该放首歌来搭配现在的气氛
I know just the music we need for this bit of our drive.

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,399
来首蒙罗的老歌。
（麦特·蒙罗，二十世纪英国流行歌手。擅长翻唱经典老歌）
Cue the Monro.

156
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,279
（歌曲：这样的一天，麦特·蒙罗演唱）
(ON DAYS LIKE THESE BY MATT MONRO PLAYING)

157
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,759
哈蒙德：喔，这景色真是美极了
HAMMOND: Ooh, this is pretty,

158
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,239
从我这辆意大利超跑里往外看
looking at all of these Italian things from my Italian grand touring supercar.

159
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,319
我们进隧道的时候要格外小心
We just have to be careful that if we go into a tunnel,

160
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,779
以防撞上那些推土机（讽刺旁边车道的慢车）
we don't hit a bulldozer.

161
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,559
克拉克森：噢，这真的是...噢！
CLARKSON: Oh, thst's just... Oh!

162
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,399
这感觉太棒了
This is just magnificent.

163
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,319
但很快转向的问题接踵而至
But soon the real resaon for turning off became apparent.

164
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,719
因为道路变得越来越崎岖
As the rosds became more twisty,

165
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,799
法拉利变得越来越难驾驭
the Ferrari was becoming more of s handfuL.

166
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,279
噢-噢！噢！
Oh-ho! Oh!

167
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,639
呃，确实需要小心一点对待这730匹的马力
Uh, just need to be a bit careful about unleashing 730 brake horsepower.

168
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,239
这车的马力比一辆F1赛车还大，我突然意识到了这点
It's actually more than an F1 car and I'm conscious of that right now.

169
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,479
（呻吟）救命！噢！
(GROANS) Help! Oh!

170
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,239
噢！好的。
Oh! Yeah.

171
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,439
我一点也不紧张
I wasn't scared.

172
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,999
我一点也不怀疑那辆法拉利确实比这辆奔驰更快
I have no doubt that the Ferrari is faster than this

173
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:23,399
但这辆驾驶起来更舒服，因为它不会让你感到紧张
but this is just nicer to drive'cause it's less frightening.

174
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,119
哈蒙德：在这辆F12里，法拉利为你提供了一切
HAMMOND: With the F12, Ferrari have given you everything you need

175
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,839
能为你增添驾驶乐趣的配置
to have an incredible drive

176
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,599
同时也会把你卷入巨大的麻烦
or get yourself into a very great deal of trouble.

177
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,159
如果让一位赛车手来驾驶这辆车他会告诉你
Get a racing driver in this car and he will tell you,

178
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,479
“是的，这是一辆真正的跑车”
"Yes, that is a real car."

179
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,999
这车不是为那些经常混迹高尔夫球场
It's not been tamed for people to park at the golf course

180
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,719
或者酒吧的人所设计的
and talk about in the bar.

181
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,999
这车和标准版SLS的差别让人惊叹
It's amazing how different this is to the standard SLS,

182
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,879
标准版SLS车尾状态极其不稳定
which would be wobbling its bottom all over everywhere.

183
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,599
但这辆不会，因为它有一套独特的电子差速器
This isn't, because of its eLectronic differential.

184
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,959
你可以把它看成一辆保时捷GT3
You can think of it really like a Porsche GT3,

185
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,399
轻盈，扎实，精准，所有这些特性集于一身
lightened, hard,focused, on it, built for this.

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,439
这辆SLS的表现就好像是
The SLS behaving like this is like

187
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,319
让艾迪·伊扎德（喜剧演员）出演莎翁的戏剧《理查德三世》，这简直是...
Eddie Izzard doing Richard III, it's...

188
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,799
这奇怪的感觉就像你看的一出哑剧
It's almost weird to watch a pantomime character

189
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,479
突然变得非常容易理解
become so straight.

190
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,159
很奇怪但又很精彩
Weird and yet brilliant.

191
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,599
终于，我们来到了今晚住宿的地点
Eventually,we reached our overnight halt

192
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,899
我和那很有人文气质的同事一起享用晚餐
and I went for supper with my cuLtured coLLeague.

193
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,679
克拉克森：你说你喜欢湖区是啥意思？
CLARKSON: What do you mean you prefer the Lake District?

194
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,919
哈蒙德：这里很漂亮，确实如此
HAMMOND: Well, this is beautiful.It is.

195
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,279
-说实话，在我看来...
-这里比德文特湖更漂亮（英格兰湖泊，位于英格兰国家公园）
-And to be honest, for me...
-More beautiful than Derwentwater.

196
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,079
加尔达湖甚至不是这里最美的湖，但你看啊！
Garda's not even the prettiest lake and look at it!

197
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,159
这里确实很美。但如果面积能缩小75%
It's very lovely.Just scale it down to 75% of that

198
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,319
再加上细雨做点缀以及...
and then introduce a bit of drizzle and...

199
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,119
-凯西克也在湖区吗？
（英格兰坎布里亚郡的一个集镇。德文特湖以北，靠近巴森怀特湖和湖区国家公园）
-哦，是的
-Is Keswick in the Lake District?
-Ooh, yeah.

200
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,639
克拉克森：你在凯西克是看不到这些食物的。你以前见过吗？
CLARKSON: What you don't get in Keswick are these. Have you had one?

201
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,559
-从没见过。 -尝个辣椒。试试
-No. -Have a pepper. Eat.

202
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,399
吃吧。尝尝。你会喜欢它的
Eat. Eat it. Go on, you'll like it.

203
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,599
我不是很喜欢
I don't like it.

204
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,839
（笑）
(LAUGHS)

205
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,679
克拉克森：之后我们决定玩个我们喜欢的游戏
CLARKSON: Then we thought we'd play our favourite game.

206
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,119
他手里拿着一份法拉利选配价目表
He's got the Ferrari options pricelist there

207
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,079
我会猜猜那些配置都值多少钱
and I'm going to guess how much they cost.

208
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,239
这里有一大串选配目录
There are quite a lot of options available.

209
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,599
挑一些说来听听
Pick some.

210
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,319
好的。碳纤维比赛座椅
Okay. Racing seats with carbon fibre.

211
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,639
我不确定，600英镑（5963人民币）？
I don't know, 600 quid?

212
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,239
5184英镑（51528人民币）
£5184.

213
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,159
-我猜的有点点低。 -是的
-I was a bit under. -Yeah.

214
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,639
还有碳纤维轮毂罩，车轮上的，你知道，就是在...
But carbon fibre wheel caps,on the tyres, you know, on the...

215
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,319
-什么，防尘罩？ -是的
-What, dust caps? -Yeah.

216
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,439
碳纤维防尘罩？十英镑吧（99人民币）
Carbon fibre dust caps? Tenner.

217
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,079
480英镑（4771人民币）。我认为还是很便宜的
£480. I thought that was cheap.

218
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,079
-什么，就四个防尘罩？ -是的
-What, for four dust caps? -Yeah.

219
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,999
480镑？
£480?

220
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,479
有杯托吗？
Are the cup holders standard?

221
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,799
有碳纤维杯托选装配件
There is a carbon fibre cup holder you can get.

222
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,839
-一个碳纤维杯托？ -是的，你知道，就是用来放杯子的...
-A carbon fibre cup holder? -Yeah, you know, it pops in...

223
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,479
好吧，兰博基尼盖拉多上的这玩意价格在600英镑左右（5964人民币）
Well, they were £600 on a Lamborghini Gallardo a while back,

224
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,279
所以我猜法拉利上面值1000英镑（9940人民币）
so I'll go a thousand.

225
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,119
2112英镑（20993人民币），没错，真是太惊人了
£2112. Yeah, this is amazing.

226
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,999
事实上，这辆车才是最便宜的选配
Really, the car is the cheapest option.

227
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,559
哈蒙德：隔天，在我们研究地图之后意外发现
HAMMOND: The next day,we consulted a map and realised

228
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,119
离我们所在地不远的地方就坐落着目前F1赛历上均速最高的赛道...
we were just a spit from the fastest Grand Prix track on the calendar...

229
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,519
蒙扎
Monza.

230
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,319
速度的殿堂
The Cathedral of Speed.

231
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,759
因为这里能把速度开到如此之快
Because it's so fast,

232
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,039
我决定抛弃法拉利换上更快的
I've ditched the Ferrari and upped the ante

233
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,199
帕加尼风神
to this Pagani Huayra,

234
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,519
依旧是一台V12引擎但是配备了两台涡轮
still a V12 but now with two turbos.

235
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,639
因为在这里你需要火箭一般的速度
'Cause what you need here is a missile.

236
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,439
我选择了一辆保时捷Cayman S
I've gone for a Porsche Cayman S.

237
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,799
-你做了一个愚蠢的决定。 -不，我没有
-You're just being obtuse. -I'm not.

238
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,199
就是愚蠢的决定。你选择了保时捷
You are. You've gone for a Porsche

239
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,639
但你却没有选择911.这就是愚蠢
so you can not go for a 911.It's just annoying.

240
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,759
这辆比911更优秀
This is better than a 911.

241
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,999
-它不如911！911比这货强。-不是你想的那样
-It isn't! A 911 is better than that. -It isn't.

242
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,559
-因为911的引擎在这里。-没错。
-Because the 911 has its engine here. -Yes.

243
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,719
-这辆是中置引擎。-因为它不是911
-This is mid-engine. -Because it isn't a 911.

244
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,879
-不！-它更棒！
-No! -It's better!

245
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,439
听着，如果我们是在卡德维尔公园赛道，或者莱顿赛道（都是英国本土赛道）
Listen,if we were driving around Cadwell Park, Lydden Hill...

246
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,559
-是的。-弯又多又急，没错！
-Yeah. -Nippy and fizzy, yes!

247
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,999
但这里是蒙扎。你需要强大的动力
But not here at Monza. You need power.

248
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,519
你或许只注意到了这条
You're just hung up on this

249
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,759
-又长又直的大直道。-没错
-great big long straight. -Yes.

250
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,919
但在那之后的某些地方一定有弯道
But there must be a corner down there somewhere,

251
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,679
否则你不会出现在赛道的另一端
otherwise you wouldn't be able to get down there again.

252
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,359
这里一定有...事实上这里有两个弯道
There has to be...In fact there've got to be two corners.

253
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,239
-是啊，天才，这里有两个弯道。-是的
-Yes, genius, that's two corners. -Yeah.

254
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,679
你真有才。你知道吗？
Brilliant. Do you know what?

255
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,359
帕加尼风神过弯的本事也是数一数二的
The Pagani Huayra goes around corners really incredibly well.

256
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,119
你不会相信它过弯的速度有多惊人
You will not believe how fast this goes around corners.

257
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,959
-好吧。-我的车更棒
-Okay. -It's a lot better.

258
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,439
克拉克森：事实确是如此，我不喜欢保时捷
CLARKSON: It's true,I don't like Porches

259
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,959
并且我也不喜欢驾驶它们的人
and I don't much like the people who drive them,

260
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,159
特别是他们之中有两个叫詹姆士和理查德的家伙
especially the ones called James and Richard.

261
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,279
我也不喜欢最初的Cayman
I didn't much like the original Cayman, either,

262
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,759
我把它叫做鸟车
I called it the Cockster.

263
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,999
在这车身上还有两样我不喜欢的东西
And there are one or two things that I don't much like about this.

264
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,679
一个是设计风格，比如这车长得太像911了
The styling, for example,I think it looks too like a 911.

265
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,279
还有这个座椅，肩部支撑太狭窄
And then there's the seats,the shoulder bolsters are too narrow.

266
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,999
所以如果你有一副和我一样伟岸的肩膀，
So, if you're broad-shouldered and hunky, like me,

267
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,639
你开这车就会觉得很难受
you're getting sort of squashed all the time.

268
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,559
但除此之外，这车的一切都很完美
However, the rest of it is absolutely sublime.

269
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,839
这车有一套自适应悬挂系统，这就意味着
You've got these adaptive dampers,which means that it rides

270
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:58,599
它的驾乘感、操控感、转向感都和最棒的超级跑车毫无二致
and handles and steers like the very best supercars.

271
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,639
但是其中最棒的还是它的引擎。一台3.4升水平对置六缸发动机
But the best thing is the engine.A 3.4-litre flat six.

272
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,719
这台机器毫无瑕疵
There's just no thing about it that's wrong.

273
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,879
在任何时候它都能发出这种...你能听见
And all the time it makes this... You can hear that

274
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,599
那种低沉，铿锵有力的声浪
deep, reassuring noise,

275
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,439
这就像是把理查德·伯顿塞进你的后备箱
（理查德·伯顿，英国影史上的巨星，尤善演莎士比亚笔下人物）
it's like having Richard Burton in the boot,

276
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,039
他会无休止的赞美你的发型，
endlessly complimenting you on your hair

277
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,999
你的着装，你的驾驶技术
and your clothes and your driving style.

278
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,039
噢，我的天！这真的太快了！
Oh, my God! That is so fast!

279
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,079
噢，我的天！
Oh, my God!

280
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,559
230km/h，240km/h，250km/h
230, 240, 250,

281
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,919
260km/h
260 kilometres an hour.

282
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,919
270km/h！我勒个亲娘
270! Oh, dear God.

283
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,559
噢！我已经被自己的这速度吓得屁滚尿流了
Oh! I scared the crap out of myself then.

284
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,239
天啊...
Holy sh...

285
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,039
老天爷！
Oh, my God!

286
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,519
真是台厉害的机器！
What a machine!

287
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,199
蒙扎就是速度的代名词
Monza is all about speed

288
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,359
而帕加尼风神除了拥有速度之外也再无其他
and a Pagani Huayra is about that and very little else.

289
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,319
6.3升，V12，双涡轮
6.3-litre, v12, twin turbos.

290
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,759
货真价实，巨大的动力
Truly, enormously powerful.

291
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,519
进弯，宽大的轮胎提供了强大的抓地力
Turning in, immense grip from those fat tyres.

292
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,110
我有空气，主动空气制动系统帮我时刻保持在赛道内
I have aero, active aero keeping me planted on the track.

293
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,439
这套系统用来保证这车完美运行，而不像那些中看不中用的花架子
These things are built to work as well,they're not some fragile trailer queen.

294
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,519
我驾驶的这台车已经有8万6千公里的里程了
This car I'm in has done 86,000 kilometres.

295
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,999
我猜这些里程当中没多少是温柔驾驶的
And I'm guessing not many of them were gentle.

296
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,599
法拉利或许很出色，但它肯定不如帕加尼这般完美
The Ferrari would've been good at this but not as good as the Huayra.

297
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,559
哈蒙德的问题在于他的速度太快了
The problem is Hammond is going too fast,

298
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,599
他没有好好品味这条赛道的光荣以及历史积淀
he's not savouring this glorious,historical track.

299
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,559
他只是快速的掠过这条赛道，像猪八戒吃人参果一样糟蹋美食
He's just wolfing it down,like a dog wolfs down a steak.

300
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,679
（哇呜）
(GOBBLES)

301
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,839
而我现在做的则是细嚼慢咽，慢慢品尝每一口美味
What I'm doing is masticating,enjoying every mouthful.

302
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,279
哈蒙德：当杰瑞米驾驶着他选择的错误车辆在赛道上龟速行驶时
HAMMOND: As Jeremy crawled round in his wrong car,

303
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,399
我早就开到维修区等着他回来了
I was waiting for him to get back to the pits.

304
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,639
还要等很久他才能回来，是吗？
He's going to be a while, isn't he?

305
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,279
趁着他还在龟行，让我为各位介绍一下帕加尼的内饰
While he's gone, let me show you the interior of the Pagani.

306
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,759
这值得一观
It's worth seeing.

307
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,679
他们希望坐在这车里让人感觉独一无二，而我确信他们成功地做到了这一点
They want it to feel special in here and I think they've succeeded.

308
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,599
他们真的把思想融入其中，让它感觉很独特
They've really put thought into this,making it feel special.

309
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,679
这里的档位连接，所有的这些部件
This gear linkage here,all these parts,

310
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,279
一共67个零件构成了这部分独特的透视结构
there's 67 components have gone into making that

311
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,319
能让你清楚地看见它是怎么工作的
in that skeleton form,so you can see it working.

312
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,719
关于用料也很讲究，用的都是货真价实的材质
And the materials, too,it's all genuine,

313
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,839
大量的碳纤维，真皮，以及铝合金
a lot of real carbon fibre,real leather. And the aluminium,

314
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,879
每一件你所见到的铝合金部件都不是简单铸造而成
every single aluminium component you can see in here isn't cast,

315
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,159
而是通过一整块铝锭铣削而成
it's milled from a single piece,a single billet, a lump of aluminium.

316
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,199
所有这一切都意味着它给人的感觉就和它的价格一样高贵
All of which means it feels as expensive as it is.

317
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,959
我喜欢这辆车。他还没回来，是吗？
I like this car.He's not back yet, is he?

318
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,119
这是世界上唯一一条拥有两个lesbos弯道的赛道（一句废话- -#）
第一个弯非常急
This is the only track in the world with two lesbos, the first one's quite tight,

319
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,319
第二个弯能让你瞬间失禁
second one, though,you can really hang your arse out.

320
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,919
就是这里
There it is.

321
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,399
这是12气缸的全貌。让我们数数看，这会很费时间...
It's 12 cylinders in total.Let's count them, it'll pass the time.

322
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,959
1,2...喔，我数得有点快了，不妨数的久一点
One, two... Oh, I'm going too quickly,might as well make it last.

323
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,199
3...噢，等等。哦！
Three... Oh, hang on. Oh!

324
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,799
你现在一定有这种感觉了...
You must be feeling now...

325
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,279
-什么感觉？-...你选了一辆错误的车
-What? -...that you brought the wrong car.

326
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,799
让我给你读一段东西，如果可以的话。描述这辆保时捷的
Let me read you something, if I may.Talking about this.

327
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,119
“这辆车的过弯平衡性近乎完美，
"The car's cornering balance is near perfect,

328
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,799
具有接近中性并且有预见性地油门平衡特点
"neutral but unerringly predictable on a balanced throttle

329
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,119
如果在你开始释放前轮的横向载荷之前
"and biased ever so slightly towards understeer

330
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,759
轻收一点油门
"if you throttle up before you begin easing

331
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,319
本车就会带有一点轻微的转向不足特性”（鬼知道翻译的对不对）
"the lateral load out of the front tyres."

332
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,839
这不是我说的，这是汽车杂志原文
Not my words, the words of Autocarmagazine.

333
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,279
哇呜！你念的这些文字是什么意思？
Wow! What do those words actually mean?

334
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,479
-我不清楚 -我也不理解
-I've no idea. -Me, neither.

335
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,519
但是我要回到赛道上去试试所谓的
But I'm going to go back out there now and throttle up

336
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,839
“释放前轮横向载荷之前轻收油门”会发生什么事
before I've eased the lateral load out of the front tyres and see what happens.

337
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,559
-是嘛！-这就是我要干的
-Yeah! -That's what I'm going to do.

338
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,119
我一点也不理解那些东西是啥意思。乱七八糟
I have no idea what any of that means.I haven't a clue.

339
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,839
好的！收油门
Right! Throttle up.

340
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,039
喔，你瞧见了吧？
Oh, now you see?

341
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,119
这会产生甩尾
Now, that's just a spin.

342
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,359
看吧，汽车杂志，这会转向过度
Now, you see, Autocar, that's oversteer.

343
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,559
有时候你读一些道路测试的文章时你不禁会发出慨叹，“这写的都是些什么东西啊？”
Sometime you read road tests and you do think, "What are you on about?"

344
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,199
这是一辆不错的车，它能把你吓得屁滚尿流
It's a really nice car and you can get the arse out.

345
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,879
哈蒙德：终于
HAMMOND: Finally.

346
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,159
-还是假装这车很有乐趣？-是的
-Still pretending to have fun? -Yeah.

347
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,679
-呃，这车会把你吓得失禁吗？-会怎么样？
-Will, uh, will Poo be like this? -Will what?

348
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,159
屁滚尿流，当我们到达目的地的时候
Poo, when we go there.

349
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,479
哦，波城？
Oh, Pau?

350
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,519
你知道我最喜欢的地方吗？
Do you know my favourite bit?

351
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,839
-哈蒙德：是的，是的。-你能...
-HAMMOND: Yes. Yes.-You could...

352
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,799
保时捷通过这里的时候，它就像闪电一般迅速（阿斯卡里弯）
The Porsche through there,it's just a streak of lightning.

353
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,159
没有任何车能比它更快
Nothing is faster than that.

354
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,599
绝对没有。也没有任何车...在这个弯比它快
Nothing is.Nothing's faster... Or through there.

355
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,479
是的，你有点语无伦次了。它确实很快。它是辆很快的小跑车
Yes, you're getting a bit carried away.It's fast. 
It's a quick little car.

356
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,439
说实话，它在居民区会更快
To be honest,it's more at home in this bit here.

357
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,079
你能“哦，看啊！”驶过商店
You could "Oh, look!" past the shops

358
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,079
还有“噢，还有这学校和超市”
and "Oh, there's a school and a supermarket."

359
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,559
这些地方才是这车的归宿。不是在这条赛道上
And that's really where it belongs.Not here.

360
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,919
-你错了。-我没错
-You're wrong.-I'm not wrong.

361
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,199
哈蒙德，我用任何你喜欢的东西做赌注和你打赌，保时捷更快
Hammond, I bet you anything you like that around here the Porsche is faster.

362
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,399
杰瑞米，那真是...
Jeremy, that's...

363
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,879
-好吧！-打赌输的人要说
-Okay!-Whoever loses has to say,

364
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,879
“我爱詹姆斯·梅”
"I love James May."

365
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,839
输的人要对着镜头说这句话
They have to say that on television to a camera.

366
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,679
没问题
Fine.

367
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,079
你一定要对着摄像机镜头说“我爱詹姆斯·梅”
You actually have to go up to the camera and go, "I love James May."

368
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,599
没问题。我期待着听到你说出这句话
All right. Well, I look forward to hearing you say it.

369
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,239
噢，这里有两个lesmos弯
Oh, they're lesmos.

370
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,199
我本以为那里只有一个lesmos弯...没想到居然有两个...
I thought there was lesbo one and...It's lesmo...

371
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,159
马丁·布伦德尔一定患了伤风
（马丁·布伦德尔，英国前F1车手，现天空体育评论员）
Martin Brundle must have had a cold.

372
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,519
好的
Right.

373
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,559
（意大利语）
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

374
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,919
开始了
And we are away.

375
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,399
（打呵欠）
(YAWNS)

376
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,639
噢，天啊！这真是令人尴尬
Oh, God! This is just embarrassing

377
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,599
难道我的成就感就是靠击败他这样的人才能实现的？
because where's going to be my sense of achievement when I thrash him?

378
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,599
克拉克森：有一条关于车的金科玉律
CLARKSON: There is a point with cars

379
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,119
当一辆车马力越大速度越高时
where they become so powerful and so fast

380
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,319
它就会让人越难以驾驭以及越紧张
they become too hectic and too frightening.

381
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,479
这就是那辆...（￥#&￥%！）的问题所在（火星语～）
That's the problem with the...(MOCKINGLY) Huayra.

382
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,599
通过第一个lesmo弯
Through the first of the lesmo corners,as it turns out.

383
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,279
克拉克森：我知道这听起来有点愚蠢
CLARKSON: I know it sounds silly but once you go

384
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,999
但当你驾驶一辆马力超过500-550的跑车时，你会变得更慢
beyond 500-550 horsepower,you end up driving the car more slowly.

385
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,639
听起来很奇怪但确是事实
It's weird but it's true.

386
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,759
从没有人做过这样愚蠢的事情
Never has there been a more stark example of

387
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,879
竟然拿着菜刀去参加枪战
bringing a knife to a gunfight.

388
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,159
保时捷在这条赛道上，我能保证每一圈都把它牢牢的留在赛道内
The Porsche, around here,I'm absolutely pinning it everywhere.

389
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,119
它不会让我觉得难以驾驭和紧张，驾驶它很轻松
It doesn't worry me,it's not frightening, it's easy.

390
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,279
而那货，就...
That thing, though...

391
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,519
好吧，走着瞧
Well, we shall see.

392
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,559
我的话会得到证明，而哈蒙德会对着镜头说“我爱詹姆斯·梅”
My case will be proven and he will be saying, "I love James May."

393
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,079
我看见了270公里的时速
That's 270 I saw there.

394
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,319
他不会看见这么惊人的数字
He won't see anything like that.

395
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,679
噢
Oh.

396
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,399
我听见了小矮人靠近终点线的声音
I hear the sound of an approaching midget.

397
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,959
全油门
Fully on the power.

398
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,039
准备，保持...
Ready, steady...

399
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,839
冲线！
And across the line!

400
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,959
2分14秒8
Two minutes, 14.8.

401
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,599
我们通常管这叫2分15秒
We'll call it 2:15.

402
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,559
接下来轮到Cayman登场
Then it was the Cayman's turn.

403
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,639
（意大利语）
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

404
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,199
说实话，我对此一点也不感到高兴
Really, I am taking no pleasure in this.

405
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,159
但他需要在此上一课
But he does need to learn a lesson,

406
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,719
你不能以个人喜好来判断一辆车的好坏
that you can't just go making stupid claims about a car

407
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,799
这简直太愚蠢了
just 'cause you like it.

408
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,559
不，说真的，对于那辆车...我只需要用一个煮蛋计时器
No, seriously, that thing round...I could be using an egg timer.

409
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,599
他怎么会认为他能靠那辆车击败我？
How does he imagine he can possibly make up enough time?

410
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,959
不管他认为他的技术有多好
No matter how good he thinks he is in it.

411
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,999
显然，他不可能...算了
Clearly, it's not going to... Anyway.

412
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,999
-你说啥？-你！
-You what? -Mate!

413
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,439
你怎么在...你不是在...
Where... Why aren't you...

414
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,279
我没说过我去开车
I didn't say I'd be driving it.

415
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,399
那谁在开那辆车？
Well, who is?

416
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,599
据说开车的是Stig，事实确实如此
Well, some say it's The Stig, and it is.

417
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,919
你什么时候说过我要开车了吗？没有
Did you at any point say I had to drive it? No.

418
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,199
你什么时候有说过你会用Stig了吗？
Did you at any point say you were going to use The Stig?

419
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,279
你为什么不用呢？
Why would you not?

420
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,519
因为我认为不论从哪个角度来看
Because I think in every possible definition,

421
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,039
在任何规则下，你这都是作弊行为
in every set of rules, it's cheating.

422
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,799
噢，他来了
Oh, here he is.

423
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,599
哈蒙德：2分13秒2
HAMMOND: 2:13:2.

424
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,999
-2分13秒2. -是的
-2:13:2. -Yes.

425
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,759
你的成绩是2分14秒8. 所以Stig比你快一点几...
You were 2:14:8. So he's one point...

426
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,199
所以，各位看见了，女士们先生们，保时捷，正如我说的那样
So, there you are, ladies and gentlemen,the Porsche is, as I said,

427
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,999
比（￥#……%#）...要快
faster than the, uh...(MOCKINGLY) Huayra.

428
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,679
所以它是更好的选择
And therefore was a more sensible choice of car.

429
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,239
-不。是Stig比我快。-什么？
-No. The Stig is faster than me.-What?

430
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,159
但Stig在没有爆炸的情况下，会比任何人都快
But The Stig is faster than everyone,that's the point of The Stig,

431
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,119
这是Stig的问题
if he wasn't he'd explode.

432
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,799
克拉克森：当我们开着奔驰和法拉利离开蒙扎之后
CLARKSON: As we left Monza in the Mercedes and the Ferrari,

433
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,759
团队气氛变得很阴沉
the mood was glum.

434
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,359
这个大骗子
It's cheating.

435
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:31,989
克拉克森：但第二天早晨，当我们发现留宿小镇的名字时
CLARKSON: The next morning, however,Hammond cheered up

436
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,799
哈蒙德还是高兴了起来
when he discovered the name of the town where we'd stayed the night.

437
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,999
（窃笑）（BRA-女性内衣简写）
(BOTH SNIGGERING)

438
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,799
从Bra到法国南部里维埃拉
From Bra to the French Riviera,

439
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,679
我们可以走高速公路
we could've used the motorway.

440
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,399
但我们决定另走一条
But we decided instead

441
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,079
世界上最棒的
to use the finest switchback roads

442
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,759
盘山公路
in the world.

443
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,319
这就意味着
This meant ditching the Mercedes

444
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,599
我们将再次抛弃奔驰和法拉利
and the Ferrari

445
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,719
重新选车来面对接下来的挑战
and opting for these instead.

446
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,239
在这样的道路上
On a road like this,

447
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,719
你需要一辆身形小巧的高性能掀背钢炮
you need something small,you need a hot hatchback.

448
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,759
如果你选择一辆小钢炮
And if you're going to get a hot hatchback,

449
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,079
有什么理由不选择其中的王者？
why not get the king? This one.

450
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,719
高尔夫GTI
The Golf GTI.

451
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,159
我喜欢第一代GTI
I loved the Mk1

452
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,159
并且16气门的第二代GTI也不错
and the 16-valve Mk2 wasn't bad, either.

453
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,519
但是自那以后...我意思是虽然后继车型也不错
But since then...I mean, they weren't bad

454
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,039
但那种魔力消失了
but the magic went missing.

455
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,919
在这辆车上，第七代GTI，那种魔力又回来了
With this one, though, the Mk7,it is back.

456
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,919
这辆车能干任何事
This car can do everything.

457
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,079
工艺精湛，价格合理
It's well made, it's sensibly priced.

458
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,919
也很环保，配置丰富
It's economical, it's well-equipped.

459
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,519
有五个座位，还有一个大后备箱
It seats five, it's got a big boot.

460
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,119
但是抛开所有这一切，在外表之下
But strip all that away and underneath,

461
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,799
它的本质是一辆高性能掀背跑车
its DNA is hot hatchery.

462
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,879
（轮胎啸叫）
(TYRES SCREECHING)

463
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,599
两升涡轮增压引擎，220匹马力
Two-litre turbo engine, 220 horsepower

464
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,399
没有扭矩转向的状况发生
and no torque steer.

465
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,999
看看这个。大力制动，切入回头弯
Now, watch this. Foot hard down,going around a hairpin bend.

466
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,439
惊为天人
It's just astonishing.

467
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,559
这车的前差速器性能超乎你想象
The front diff on this is beyond belief.

468
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,939
哇呜！天啊，感觉真不错
Whoa! God, this is good.

469
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,519
这回他又选错了车
He's got it wrong again.

470
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,439
高尔夫GTI，确实是辆不错的车
The Golf GTI, it's a brilliant car,

471
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,159
可能是世界上最好的全能型车
it's probably the best all-rounder in the world.

472
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,559
但是...有一点
But that's... That's the point,

473
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,239
实际你并不需要全能车
an all-rounder is exactly what you don't need.

474
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,999
全能就意味着某些地方不可避免地作出妥协
An all-rounder is inevitably compromised.

475
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,679
我想要的只是一辆纯粹的钢炮
I just want pure distilled essence of hot hatch.

476
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,639
这意味着只有一款车适合我
And that means only one thing right now.

477
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,199
福特嘉年华ST
The Fiesta ST.

478
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,999
当福特顺利地制造出这款车时
When Ford put this car together,they assembled all the right bits

479
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,999
他们或许会想：“没错，这会是辆很棒的车”
and thought, "Yeah, I reckon that would be good."

480
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,319
我猜他们不会想到
I don't think they could possibly have known

481
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,939
这款车会成为多受追捧的一台小钢炮
quite how good it was going to turn out to be,

482
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,999
因为它太惊人了
because it's astonishing.

483
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,119
它确实比高尔夫GTI少了点马力
It's down on power compared to the Golf, yes.

484
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,719
但是它更小巧，这就意味着它更运动
But it's smaller, that's more hot hatch.

485
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,919
并且也更轻
And it's lighter,

486
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,679
这就说明它的推重比和高尔夫不分伯仲
which means the power-to-weight ratio is pretty much the same.

487
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,279
并且它十分灵活
And it's beyond nimble.

488
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,599
你随意给它一个转向
You start to just take liberties with it.

489
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,239
走出一条较宽的行车线
Deliberately running a line a little bit wide,

490
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,799
你会很兴奋地再把它给拽回来
so you get the pleasure of turning it back in.

491
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,199
（兴奋的笑）
(LAUGHS)

492
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,479
这感觉太棒了
It's superb.

493
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,799
这是我所驾驶过全世界最棒的小钢炮
It's the biggest grin-maker I think the world has ever seen.

494
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,639
在接下来的一个小村里，不可避免的
In the next village, though, inevitably,

495
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,759
杰瑞米决定寻摸点食物
Jeremy decided we should get something to eat.

496
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,999
你为啥不享用你的午餐
Why aren't you eating your lunch?

497
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,199
我不喜欢蒜泥
I don't like pesto.

498
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,359
-什么？-我不喜欢蒜泥
-What?-I don't like pesto.

499
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,039
-为什么？-这只是一滩浆糊而已
-Why not?-It's just bits.

500
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,719
克拉克森：还有一个更好的理由解释为什么我们需要停下来
CLARKSON: There was, however,a very good reason why we'd stopped.

501
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,799
你必须说出那句话。你打赌输了，要认赌服输
You've got to say it.You lost the bet, you've got to say it.

502
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,959
我不要说那句话
I'm not saying it.

503
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,359
你必须说出那句话
You've got to say it.

504
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,559
我正大光明的赢了你。保时捷比你快
I beat you fair and square.The Porsche was faster.

505
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,479
-这不公平。你作弊了。-说出那句话
-It wasn't fair. You cheated.-Say it.

506
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,999
（喃喃细语）
(MOUTHING)

507
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,359
什么？
What?

508
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,959
（含糊其辞）
(MUMBLING)

509
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,559
（咳嗽）...詹姆斯·梅
(COUGHING) ...James May.

510
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,039
-说完了。-不行。要说清楚
-There.-No. Say it so it's audible.

511
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,879
我...爱詹姆斯·梅
I...love James May.

512
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,039
克拉克森：干完了正事，我们回到了各自的车上
CLARKSON: With that done,we got back in our cars.

513
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,839
当你想象身处美国旅行时，你会自然的想到纪念碑山谷
（纪念碑山谷：美国亚利桑那州以北，犹他州以南，
科罗拉多高原一部分，美国荒凉西部的标志形象）
When you think of an American road trip,you think of Monument Valley,

514
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,639
州际公路笔直延伸至漫无边际的远方
that road spearing off into the distance.

515
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,599
你可以把这里想象成欧洲版的纪念碑山谷
Well, this is Europe's equivalent of Monument Valley.

516
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,879
这里可能是本次旅行到目前为止少数几个我喜欢的路段之一
This might just be my favourite bit of our trip so far.

517
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,199
这车、这风景
The car, the place.

518
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,679
太完美了
This is perfect.

519
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,119
克拉克森：这片神奇的土地可能是造物主
CLARKSON: When God was making this part of the world,

520
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,999
为小钢炮创造出来的。这就是它存在的理由
it was for hot hatchbacks.That's what it's for.

521
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,999
不幸的是，即便如此
Unfortunately, however,

522
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,479
我们在阿尔卑斯山路中的撒欢行为
our headlong charge down the Alps

523
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,939
还是伴随着大陆的终结戛然而止
was halted because we ran out of land.

524
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,319
（叹气）
(EXHALES)

525
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,159
-唔,这里。-什么？
-Mmm, that. -What?

526
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,639
好吧，前面就是蒙特卡洛。如果我们继续开着大众和福特进城
Well, it's Monte-Carlo.If we drive into there

527
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,359
他们会以流浪汉的名义拘捕我们
in a Volkswagen and a Ford,they'll arrest us for vagrancy.

528
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,399
确实如此
That's a good point.

529
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,879
-我想说，军火贩子在那都没事... -是的。
-I mean, you can be an arms dealer... -Yeah.

530
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,279
...但是你不能开着福特嘉年华进城
...but you can't drive around in a Fiesta.

531
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,999
-这是底线。 -我们又要换车了
-There's a limit. -We're going to need to switch.

532
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,839
克拉克森：为了掩盖屌丝气质，我们选择了这两辆车
CLARKSON: For posing,these were the cars we selected.

533
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,999
哈蒙德挑了一辆兰博基尼敞篷版Aventador
A Lamborghini Aventador Roadster for Hammond

534
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,999
而我则挑了一台敞篷版布加迪威龙
and a Bugatti Veyron for me.

535
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,039
这可不是一辆普通版的威龙
Now, this is no ordinary Veyron,

536
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,319
这是一辆维特斯特别版超级运动型威龙
this is the Grand Sport Vitesse.

537
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,519
八升排量，16气缸引擎
Eight-litre, quad-cam W16.

538
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,039
极速能达到251英里每小时（404公里每小时）
Top speed 251 miles an hour

539
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,599
在顶棚拆掉的状态下
with no roof.

540
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,559
这里才是这车的栖息地
Here it is in its natural habitat.

541
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,759
我现在切到二档。用到了二档
I'm in second gear.I'm now using second gear

542
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,999
自从我开上这车以来第一次切到二档
for, well, the first time since I set off.

543
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,799
现在又回到一档
And back down to first.

544
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,519
这里的居民很神奇，他们早上十点钟
It is extraordinary that here men get up

545
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,919
从单身公寓里爬起来
from their bachelor pads at about 10:00,

546
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,399
开着用本应交给国家的税金买来的车出门
get into their cars that they bought using money they should have paid in tax

547
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,639
然后花一天的时间
and then spend all day

548
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,999
在大街上漫无目的地转来转去
driving round and round and round in circles.

549
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,759
这有啥意义？
Why?

550
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,719
哈蒙德：路人看我开着橘色兰博基尼驶过时
HAMMOND: People see me in my orange Lamborghini Aventador Roadster

551
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,599
会这么想“这是个有钱有势的大人物”
and think, "Yes.There's a man of potency and wealth."

552
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,999
过了两秒钟，他们看见我身后那辆布加迪威龙
And then two seconds later,they see that Bugatti Veyron

553
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,359
于是又会这么想“这是个更有钱有势的大人物”
and think, "There's a richer,more powerful man."

554
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,359
我为你感到遗憾，伙计
I'm sorry about this, mate,

555
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,519
但你再次选了一辆错误的车
but once again,you're in the wrong car.

556
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,759
我要纠正你关于“再一次”的措辞
I take issue with the "once again"

557
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,719
但是的，我承认这是我第一次选错车
but, yes, for the first time,I've got the wrong car.

558
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,879
（克拉克森傻笑）
(CLARKSON LAUGHS)

559
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,839
克拉克森：没人关注你，没人
CLARKSON: Nobody is looking at you,nobody.

560
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,719
哈蒙德：如果我花29万英镑（288万人民币）
HAMMOND: If I had spent £290000

561
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,039
在一辆兰博基尼身上用来绕着摩纳哥闲逛
on a Lamborghini to drive around Monaco

562
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,599
并且你出现在我的车里
and you turned up in that,

563
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,559
我宁愿直接把它开上墙
I'd just drive this into a wall.

564
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,559
这是全世界最拜金的地方
This is the snobbiest place on earth.

565
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,519
它让...
It makes...

566
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,999
它让洛杉矶在其面前如同北朝鲜般相形见绌
It makes Los Angeles look like North Korea.

567
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,959
这种势利的氛围也会
And this snobbery is an issue

568
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,759
体现在酒店服务生为你泊车时
when you try to get your car valet parked.

569
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,599
问题在于那个伙计刚刚在巴黎饭店门口停好了他的
The problem is that chap has just turned up outside the Hotel de Paris

570
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,679
法拉利加尼弗尼亚
in a Ferrari California.

571
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,079
法拉利最廉价的车型
The cheapest Ferrari there is.

572
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,639
虽然如此，看上去他很喜欢那辆车
Nevertheless, he likes it very much.

573
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,079
是的，车很漂亮。停那的样子确实不错
Yeah, and it's nice.And as a result, it's there.

574
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,399
-是吧？起来不错。 -没错
-Okay? 'Cause it looks good. -Yeah.

575
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,759
但仅仅一会的功夫
But in a minute,

576
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,519
一个哈萨克斯坦军火贩子就开着一辆更拉风的车停在了门口
a Kazakhstani arms dealer is going to arrive in a nicer car

577
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,959
而那辆法拉利就被服务生给挪走了
and the Ferrari is going to be taken away

578
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,879
泊到酒店另一边的多层停车场
and put in a multi-storey on the other side of Monaco.

579
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,959
哈蒙德：但我们停在这里的是
HAMMOND: But we pull up there

580
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,319
一辆布加迪威龙和一辆兰博基尼Aventador敞篷版
in a Bugatti Veyron and a Lamborghini Aventador Roadster,

581
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,279
你是说还有比这两台更棒的车会出现？
are you're saying something better is going to come along than that?

582
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,719
在摩纳哥，我打赌
In Monte-Carlo, I promise you,

583
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,719
肯定会有开着企业号航母来花天酒地的金主
someone would turn up inthe USS Enterprise

584
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,039
那时我们的车肯定会被挪到阴暗的角落里去
and our cars would be in the multi-storey.

585
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,079
这和你的车多昂贵没关系
It doesn't matter how good your car is,

586
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,919
服务生最终还是会把你的车给挪走
the valet parkers will ultimately take it away

587
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,959
因为总会有更拉风的神器出现
because something better always arrives.

588
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,439
肯定有种方法能解决这个问题。这是一次完美汽车之旅
There's got to be a way around this.This is the perfect motoring trip.

589
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,719
所以我们今天要找到一辆车停在那，
So we go and check in there, in a car,

590
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,519
-这是我们完美之旅的一部分... -是的
-on our perfect road trip...-Yeah.

591
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,159
...第二天当我们出来，我们的车必须还在门口
...we come out in the morning,it's still there.

592
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,679
这就是我们的目标
That's our challenge.

593
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,839
必须是辆非常特别的车
It's going to have to be pretty special.

594
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,039
噢，没错
Oh, yeah.

595
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,879
克拉克森：哈蒙德，最终选择了这辆车
CLARKSON: Hammond, however, opted to go

596
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,479
有史以来销量最高的车型
with one of the best-selling cars the world has ever seen.

597
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,519
福特T型车
A Model T Ford.

598
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,559
但我们马上面临了一个问题
And straightaway there was a problem.

599
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,039
我们不知道如何操纵它
We didn't know how it worked.

600
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,639
好吧，让我们瞧瞧这家伙
Right, now, look.

601
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,919
检查都有些什么东西
Let's list the things.

602
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,319
一共有...一共有三个踏板
There are... There's three pedals.

603
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,479
你是怎么...挡把在哪？这是档位吗？这是...
How do you... Where's the gear?Is this the gear? That's...

604
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,559
哈蒙德：噢，如果这是...这玩意感觉不像离合器
HAMMOND: Oh, if it's...I haven't got my foot on the clutch.

605
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,879
-这不是离合器。-好吧，这个...
-That isn't the clutch. -Well, then...

606
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,719
哪个是油门？
Which one's the accelerator?

607
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,479
这是油门。这居然不是踏板，我确定...
That's the accelerator.It isn't a pedal, I'm sure...

608
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,999
我怎么把脚放上去？
How am I going to get my foot up there?

609
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,999
-呃...该怎么做？ -好吧，启动引擎
-Um... What's that do? -Right, well, start it.

610
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,359
-（喇叭声） -这不是点火开关！
-(HORN HONKING) -That's not the starter!

611
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,919
克拉克森：最终，哈蒙德还是让这老家伙动了起来
CLARKSON: Eventually,Hammond did make it begin.

612
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,759
但接下来他意识到自己还不会让这老爷子停下来
But then we learned he didn't know how to make it stop.

613
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,159
噢，现在该怎么办？
Oh, now what have I done?

614
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,959
我们在加速！
We're going faster!

615
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,959
那不是手刹。停住。停下来。
That's not the handbrake.Stop it. Stop it.

616
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,439
-（尖叫声） -把它停下来！
-(SCREAMING) -Stop it now!

617
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,879
（两人尖叫）
(BOTH SCREAMING)

618
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,199
好的，前进
Right, forwards.

619
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,679
-等等。准备。-前进
-Hang on. Now, ready. -Forwards.

620
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,159
-这不是前进。-不，它没前进，对吧？
-That's not forwards. -No, it's not at all, is it?

621
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,639
停下来。让它停住
Stop it. Make it stop.

622
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,879
它没有要停的意思，你觉得呢？
It doesn't really want to, do you know?

623
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,159
停下！
Make it stop!

624
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,039
呃，杰瑞米，我们让整个摩纳哥都陷入了拥堵
Uh, Jeremy, we've held up Monaco.

625
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,599
-我们？ -瞧后面
-Have we? -Look.

626
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,719
噢，天啊
Oh, God.

627
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,479
不一会，我们就接近了目的地
Soon, however,we were nearing our destination.

628
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,119
我不是经常说这样的话，哈蒙德
It's not often I say this, Hammond,

629
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,759
但你这回确实天才了一把
but you have been a genius.

630
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,879
你从没说过这样的话
You have never said that.

631
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,719
因为如果我们不能驾驶这辆车
Because if we can't drive this,

632
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,439
我们用什么来击败巴黎酒店的服务生？
what chance do the valet parkers at the Hotel de Paris have?

633
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,239
没有了，这是我玩过最复杂的车
None, it's the hardest thing I've ever done.

634
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,799
克拉克森：他们会想把它挪走，但他们不会成功的
CLARKSON: They'll want to move this but they won't be able to.

635
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,959
（坏笑）
(LAUGHING)

636
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,399
-你好，先生。-你好，先生
-BonJour, monsieur. -Hello, sir.

637
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,839
熄火
Shut it down.

638
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,519
哈蒙德：交给你了
HAMMOND: All yours.

639
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,719
-你好。 -你好
-BonJour. -BonJour.

640
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,159
你好
BonJour.

641
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,879
克拉克森：接下来，看看服务生能不能搞定这车？
CLARKSON: So, would the valetstaff be successful?

642
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,999
（听不清）
(INAUDIBLE)

643
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,399
显然没有
No.

644
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,839
所以，我们做到了。这就是如何击败酒店服务生的办法
So, there we go.That is how to beat the valet parkers.

645
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,759
买一辆他们玩不转的车
Buy a car they can't drive.

646
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,679
没错，但问题又来了
Yes, but the problem is

647
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,359
今天我们将要
today we are going

648
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,919
从里维埃拉前往圣特鲁佩斯
down the French Riviera to Saint-Tropez

649
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,199
我不确定
and I'm not sure

650
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,999
我要开着这辆车去那里
I want to go in that.

651
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,999
我不确信这辆车能带着我们去任何地方
I'm not sure I'd actually go anywhere in it.

652
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,439
（引擎咆哮）
(ENGINE REVVING)

653
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,399
这是捷豹E型车
This is a Jaguar E-Type.

654
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,639
这是1962年款1系敞篷版
It's a 1962 Series 1 Roadster

655
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,719
配备一台血统纯正的3.8升直列六缸引擎
with the proper 3.8-litre straight six.

656
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,279
（引擎咆哮）
(ENGINE REVVING)

657
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,199
而且这车与其它任何一辆1962年款E型车都不同
And it's not just any 1962 E-Type.

658
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,199
这台是我的
It's mine.

659
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,759
我也想不出还有哪款车
And I can think of no car

660
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,359
比这车更适合今天这样的好天气
more perfect for a day like today.

661
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,279
喔，我能
Oh, I can.

662
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,199
因为我现在驾驶的是捷豹V8 F型
Because I am in a V8 F-Type.

663
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,879
这车比哈蒙德的那辆更快
This is faster than Hammond's E-Type.

664
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,999
同时也更舒适，更环保，更可靠
It's more comfortable,more economical, more reliable,

665
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,639
空调也更优秀
more air-conditioned.

666
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,039
甚至价格也只有8万6千英镑而已（85万人民币）
And even though it costs £86,000,

667
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,439
更实惠
it's cheaper.

668
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,939
起床了，法国佬
Wake up, Frenchies.

669
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,939
噢，快得和火箭一样
Oh, that's a racket.

670
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,679
你能听见我车尾那动听的排气声浪么？
Can you hear the exhausts from back there?

671
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,719
你把远在威尼斯的人都给吵醒了
They can hear them back in Venice.

672
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,679
克拉克森：从没哪辆车比我现在开的这辆
CLARKSON: Never has a car been more perfectly tailored to its environment

673
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,159
更适合这里的环境了
than this is here.

674
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,119
这是协和客机诞生的国度
This is where the jetset was invented.

675
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,439
我们正置身于一个捷豹的国度，我能感受到
We are in Jag country, I can feel it.

676
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,039
和这里任何一家餐厅的生意会持续火爆下去不同
Not a restaurant bill will have been paid around here for decades.

677
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,959
捷豹它来去匆匆，只留下两道轮胎印
Just Jaguar tyre marks where they've screeched away.

678
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,159
“抱歉，我回去取钱”
"I'm sorry.I'll pop off and get my wallet."

679
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,119
克拉克森：70年代有一部电视剧
CLARKSON: There used to be a TV series in the '70s

680
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,999
名叫“说服者”。主演是罗杰·摩尔和汤尼·寇蒂斯
（托尼·柯蒂斯：美国50年代老牌名演员）
called The Persuaders!with Roger Moore and Tony Curtis.

681
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,719
我耳边仿佛又响起了那首主题曲
And I'm hearing that music now.

682
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,919
（说服者，主题曲）
(THE PERSUADERS!THEMEPLAYING)

683
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,279
罗杰·摩尔和汤尼·寇蒂斯
Roger Moore, Tony Curtis,

684
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,879
驾驶着法拉利Dino和阿斯顿马丁DBS
whizzing about down here in a Ferrari Dino

685
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,999
飞驰而过
and an Aston Martin DBS,

686
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,679
侦破无数大案
solving many things,

687
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,119
打击犯罪拯救美女
punching men and saving womens.

688
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,399
哈蒙德：当我也在重温那段美妙的回忆时，我的同事又开始了...
HAMMOND: I was enJoying it, too.Until...

689
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,439
哈蒙德，这里有家毕加索艺术馆
Hammond, the Picasso museum's along here.

690
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,879
我们停下来欣赏欣赏吧
We could stop and have a look.

691
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,239
你认真的?我正驾驶着我的捷豹E型车
Really? I'm in a Jaguar,

692
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,599
沐浴在浪漫的法国南部风景中
my E-Type, in the south of France,

693
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,679
你却要我停下车去看一个
and you want me stop driving to look at a man

694
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,599
把耳朵画错位画家的画展？
whose ears are in the wrong place?

695
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,199
错了，你说的是梵高
No, that was Van Gogh.

696
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,359
毕加索是那个
Picasso's the one who puts eyes

697
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,479
画错眼睛的哥们
on the wrong side of somebody's head.

698
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,919
去吧，这是一次旅行。让我们看看画展
come on, it's a road trip.Let's look at some pictures.

699
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,919
哈蒙德：你明白你刚才说的是什么话么？
HAMMOND: Did you not hear what you just said?

700
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,479
“这是一次自驾游，让我们去看看画展”
"It's a road trip.Let's look at some pictures."

701
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,599
绝不！
No!

702
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,919
噢，为啥你这么不文艺？
Oh, why are you so uncultured?

703
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,999
在瑞昂莱潘，身材火辣的姑娘们
In Juan-les-Pins,where all the girls have

704
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,079
穿着设计别致的比基尼
carefully designed topless swimsuits

705
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,759
在海滩引诱着各路游客的目光
and racehorses they keep just for fun,

706
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,279
开个玩笑，哈哈哈哈（这是个冷笑话 — —#）
for a laugh, a-ha-ha,

707
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,759
我们停下车让哈蒙德享受些美食
we pulled over so Hammond could look at some food.

708
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,319
-怎么了？ -我不喜欢吃章鱼
-What now? -I don't like octopus.

709
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,279
这菜有问题么？
What's the matter with it?

710
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,479
-这个... -你想吃我的松露
-Well... -Do you want my truffles

711
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,479
配鸡蛋卷吗？
on an omelette?

712
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,879
我不喜欢松露。你把我的这次自驾游给毁了
Don't like truffles.You are ruining this trip for me.

713
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,839
-继续。-每次你停下来找吃的
-Go on. -Every time we stop for food,

714
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,439
-你就让我吃章鱼...-这味道很棒的！
-you make me eat octopus... -It's nice!

715
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,719
...或者是螃蟹眼睛、蜗牛的触须
...or crab's eyes or snail's legs.

716
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,999
每次当我们出发没多久，你就又要停下来
And then every time we get going again,you make us stop again

717
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,599
去看那些破砖烂瓦和童话故事里的阳台
to look at a pile of bricks and then that balcony from a story.

718
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,759
这是一次自驾游
It's a road trip.

719
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,119
我们就应该去游览一些...瞧瞧我带你去过的那些名胜
We're supposed to be seeing...Look what I've brought you to.

720
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,479
在路上
On the road.

721
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,399
我把你带到了我最喜欢的一家餐厅
I've brought you to one of my favourite restaurants.

722
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,039
-一张靠近海岸的餐桌...-这不是...
-A table for two by the waterside... -It's not...

723
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,439
快吃
Eat it.

724
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,919
-这不是一次美食之旅，是吗？ -快吃
-Not an eating trip, is it? -Eat it.

725
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,919
-吃掉章鱼肉。-它还在蠕动
-Eat the octopus. -It moved.

726
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,679
它没有。这只是它的一条腿而已
It didn't.It's only one of its legs.

727
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,119
我...
I...

728
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,999
你想找家高速路便利店
Would you like to stop at a service station

729
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,999
买包炸薯片吃吗？
and get some crisps?

730
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,119
午餐过后，我们来到海湾散步
After lunch, we went for a stroll along the seafront

731
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,719
顺便看看风景
to look at the sights.

732
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,999
但本片是一部定位家庭级别的娱乐节目
But because this is a family show,

733
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,159
所以某些画面我们必须要打上马赛克（阻碍人类进步的绊脚石啊~~~）
we can't show you what those sights were.

734
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,319
就这样，我俩欣赏着这片春色，直到手里冰淇凌融化殆尽
Eventually, though,our ice creams melted completely

735
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,990
之后我们又上路了
so we set off.

736
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,999
各位明白我们一直说的完美公路之旅是什么意思吗？
You know we were talking about the perfect road trip?

737
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,759
要是现在坐在兰博基尼和布加迪里那会显得多么不和谐？
How wrong would the Lamborghini and Bugatti have been here?

738
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,399
或者福特嘉年华
Or the Ford Fiesta.

739
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,039
-没错。-（笑）
-Yeah. -(BOTH LAUGHING)

740
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,599
克拉克森：问题在于当我们抵达圣拉斐尔时
CLARKSON: The problem is that when we arrived in Saint-Raphael

741
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,250
交通就如看见的这般糟糕
the traffic was predictable.

742
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,199
捷豹E型车也出毛病了
And so was the E-Type.

743
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,559
哈蒙德的爱驹发出了很不和谐的声音
Hammond's car is sounding poorly.

744
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,599
-（引擎异响） -噢，老天
-(ENGINE CLUNKING) -Oh, God.

745
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,799
它能在堵成这样的路况下坚持到圣特鲁佩斯吗？
Will it be able to do the traffic jam into Saint-Tropez?

746
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,239
呃...
Um...

747
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,559
说实话...我真的...
I'm honestly... I'm really...

748
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,479
我真为它担心，真的，我是真心的
I am worried about her,actually, I really am.

749
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,799
你确定？
Are you?

750
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,759
噢，老天，听上去不妙
Oh, God, that doesn't sound right.

751
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,799
克拉克森：来自60年代英国的特有声响
CLARKSON: The sound of Britain in the '60s.

752
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,199
嘀嗝-嘀嗝-嘀嗝-嘀嗝-嘀...
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding...

753
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,639
（伯明翰口音）“诞生于英格兰中部的骄傲杰作”
(BRUMMIE ACCENT)"Made in the Midlands with pride.

754
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,759
“啊哈，我们把它装配的非常精良，确实如此，非常完美”
"Ah, we've really put this together very nicely, we have, very nice.

755
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,479
“那辆E型车是我们的杰作，我们的杰作”
"Done a good job with that E-Type, we have."

756
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,679
喔，油尺太烫了，完全不能碰
Ow, dipstick's too hot,can't touch that.

757
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,319
-噢。-理查德
-Oh. -Richard.

758
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,839
-什么事？ 我为你买了一件礼物
-What? -I've bought you something

759
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,959
让你振作起来
to cheer you up.

760
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,919
-你买了啥？ -这是件小礼物
-Have you? -It's a little present.

761
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,039
是吗？
Is it?

762
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,159
一个捞鱼网
It's a fishing net.

763
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,159
我知道这和你的E型车有些许不同
I know it's not the same as an E-Type

764
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,719
但你的车既然趴窝了，你就有机会用到它了
but now this doesn't work any more,you can have that.

765
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,359
谢谢你的鱼网
Thank you for my fishing net.

766
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,959
我花了三欧元，比你的车还贵（25元人民币）
It's three Euros,which is more than this is worth.

767
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,119
异口同声：目前如此
BOTH: Now.

768
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,159
克拉克森：之后我突发奇想
CLARKSON: I then had an idea.

769
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,039
我们现在开始一场比赛看看谁先到圣特鲁佩斯
We'll have a race from here to Saint-Tropez

770
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,399
但我们会在这留宿一晚，好吗？
but we'll stay the night, yes?

771
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,879
-比赛。-可我的车...
-A race. -What...

772
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,119
不
No.

773
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,639
-不用这些车。-弃用捷豹
-Ditch these. -Ditch the Jags.

774
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,759
你也没别的选择了
You've got no choice.

775
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,559
那家酒店叫什么名字？巴黎酒店
What's that new hotel called?Hotel de Paris.

776
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,479
-它有一个顶层酒吧。-是的
-It's got a rooftop bar. -Okay.

777
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,159
最后一个抵达那里的人
Last one there

778
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,159
必须穿上一件印有“我爱詹姆斯·梅”的T恤衫
has to wear an"I love James May" T-shirt

779
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,359
一整天
tomorrow, all day.

780
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,259
这是个比较狠的赌注，但是，呃...
That's quite a forfeit but, um...

781
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,279
我接受
Yeah.

782
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,999
哈蒙德：（拉链声）我想到一个绝妙的主意
HAMMOND: (ZIPPING UP) I have had such a brilliant idea

783
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,239
用来击败克拉克森
that Clarkson has had it.

784
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,199
因为我要用这个前往圣特鲁佩斯
Because I am going to Saint-Tropez on this.

785
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,999
杜卡迪Diavel
The Ducati Diavel.

786
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,479
黑暗系列
Dark.

787
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,719
-克拉克森：你准备好了吗，哈蒙德？ -准备好了
-CLARKSON: Are you ready, Hammond? -Yeah.

788
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,319
克拉克森：倒计时3，
CLARKSON: In three,

789
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,159
2，1...
two, one...

790
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,479
出发！
Go!

791
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,199
好的。
All right.

792
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,399
（叹气）
(SIGHS)

793
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,999
（奸笑）
(CHUCKLES)

794
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,799
我选择这辆摩托有着很好的理由
I chose this bike for a very good reason.

795
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,999
这车有一台1200CC V型双缸引擎
The engine,1200cc V-twin,

796
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,199
来自杜卡迪超级摩托1198
taken from a Ducati sports bike,the 1198.

797
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,159
对杜卡迪而言，相信我，在超级摩托制造领域绝对有两把刷子
And Ducati, trust me, know a thing or two about making fast bikes.

798
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,719
英国版本有162匹制动马力，
162 brake horsepower, the UK edition.

799
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,479
在法国由于受限制只有100马力
Restricted in France to 100.

800
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,639
但你知道吗？
But you know what?

801
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,199
这样的动力也足够我达成今天的目标了
That's still going to be plenty for what I want to do today.

802
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,679
最高时速170英里（273公里）
Top speed about 170,

803
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,759
0到60英里加速2.5秒（0-96公里）
0-60 about two and a half,

804
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,519
你懂的，这加速度和布加迪威龙一样快。（得意的笑）
you know, the same as a Bugatti Veyron.(LAUGHS)

805
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,079
堵车，瞧见了吧？
Traffic, you see?

806
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,959
在这种交通状况下他怎么可能比我先到？
How's he going to get to even this?

807
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,919
他甚至都不可能开出这个小镇
He's never even going to get out of town.

808
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,359
我看起来碉堡了。这车开起来就像阵风似的
I look cool. It goes like the clappers.

809
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,399
克拉克森一定被堵在其中
Clarkson's had it here.

810
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,479
走了。瞧见了吧？一路通畅！
There you go. See that? Clear!

811
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,479
哈罗
Hello.

812
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,759
欢迎光临Fairline Squadron 78型游艇
（Fairline：英国豪华游艇制造商）
You join me on a Fairline Squadron 78.

813
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,559
整艘船有78英尺长（24米）
That's 78 feet long.

814
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,239
这船的引擎规格让人难以置信
The engines in this thing are unbelievable,

815
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:39,199
排量32升，双涡轮增压V12引擎
32-litre, twin turbocharged V12s.

816
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,239
让我们乘风破浪吧
Here we go.

817
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,719
我甚至能像这样驾船
And you can drive it like this.

818
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,439
或者这样
Or like that.

819
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,599
同样因为它是艘船
And because it's a boat,

820
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,399
它能直接穿越海湾抵达圣特鲁佩斯
I could get to Saint-Tropez across the bay.

821
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,919
而哈蒙德却要绕着海湾前进
Whereas Hammond had to go all the way round it.

822
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,239
左摆右摆，穿过车龙，就是如此轻松
Sneaking through,sneaking through, just.

823
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,599
每辆车都有可能
Every car counts.

824
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,079
任何一辆车里面都可能藏着克拉克森
Any one of these could be Clarkson.

825
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,479
他在哪？
Where is he?

826
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,359
如果我路过他
If I have been past him,

827
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,159
他就会看见我穿着皮衣的背影，然后吃惊的喊道
he would have been looking at my bottom in leather, going,

828
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,759
“噢，看，那个穿着皮衣的男人”他会迷恋上哥的
"Oh, look, a man's bottom in leather."He's obsessed with it.

829
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,039
我不知道哈蒙德用的是交通工具
I don't know what Richard Hammond is using,

830
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,559
但我猜想
but I'm guessing

831
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,799
一定是摩托车之类的玩意
it's a motorcycle of some sort.

832
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,079
所以他一定全身裹着紧身皮衣
So he'll be dressed from head to foot in leather,

833
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,679
对着车龙大喊大叫
furious at the traffic,

834
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,159
屁股就像这样...（咆哮着）
with his bottom... (GROWLING)

835
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,599
“看看我，我骑着一辆超级摩托”
"Look at me, I'm on a motorbike.

836
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,759
“我驾驶着一辆疯狂的野兽！”
"I'm straddling a throbbing machine!"

837
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,999
我才不可能做出那么粗野的事
I'm not doing any of that.

838
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,079
卫星导航显示我们即将进入圣特鲁佩斯海港
Got the satnav down here to bring us onto the bearing of Saint-Tropez.

839
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,319
我只需要把转速稍微调高一点点
I'm just going to take it up a little bit more,

840
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,719
2300转
2300 rpm a side.

841
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,639
好好看看吧。学着点！
Look at this. Look at this now!

842
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,879
吃我的尾气吧，哈蒙德！
Eat my diesel, Hammond!

843
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,839
哈蒙德：我真希望在这些角落里
HAMMOND: I just want to come round one of these corners

844
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,359
看见一辆迈凯轮12C
and see a McLaren 12C.

845
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,199
或者一辆奔驰SLS黑色版本
Or an SLS Black.

846
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,959
他会被困在这里动弹不得。而我将从他的身边疾驶而过
And he will be stuck.And I will pass him.

847
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,759
我会问他“唔，摩托车
And I will ask him, "Mmm, bikes.

848
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,679
还觉得摩托车没用吗？”（大笑）
"Still no good?" (LAUGHS)

849
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,799
摄像组的同仁们有谁想来一杯的？
Anyone fancy a drink in the crew?

850
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,599
-都要？ -好的
-Yeah? -Yeah.

851
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,239
麻烦一下
Excuse me.

852
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,799
非常感谢
Thanks very much.

853
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,359
拥堵的车流。拥堵的车流
Standing traffic. Standing traffic.

854
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,919
出现吧，克拉克森，你在哪？
Come on, Clarkson, where are you?

855
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,479
当没人打开车门或左转时
As long as nobody opens their door or suddenly turns left,

856
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,719
我能一直在路中间这样行驶
I can just keep hacking through it like this.

857
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,959
噢，就怕这样。有人突然打开车门
Oh, there you go. That's the door open.

858
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,079
这只是其中之一而已
That's the one.

859
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,039
像突然开门的这种人不在少数
That's the fella. There's always one.

860
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,599
克拉克森可能就在这堆车里。我随时可能碰上他
He's going to be in any one of these.
Any minute now I'm going to see him.

861
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,439
这一定就是他了
This has got to be him.

862
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,959
女士们先生们，哈罗，杰瑞米·克拉克森
Ladies and gentlemen,hello, Jeremy Clarkson.

863
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,959
不，这不是他
No. That's not him.

864
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,319
克拉克森：在满船的欢歌笑语中
CLARKSON: With the Squadron at full chat

865
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,119
我们就要进入圣特鲁佩斯的海港了
and Saint-Tropez very close indeed,

866
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,519
船上的感觉真是太安逸了
life on the boat was good.

867
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,919
（嚎叫）瞎嘟囔
(GROWLS) Grunt!

868
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,319
我真是爱死这车了
This is more like it.

869
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,239
飞速驶近终点
Getting a proper move on.

870
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,599
摆脱了糟糕的圣特鲁佩斯大堵车
Having cleared the worst of the Saint-Raphael traffic,

871
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,119
我回到了正常路况极速前进
I was now on the open road and closing fast.

872
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,879
好吧，感觉起来，说实在的
Okay, there is, I'll be honest,

873
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,679
他只有很小的可能性
a tiny, tiny chance

874
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,959
穿过了密集的车流
he got through all of that traffic and out of town

875
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,199
抵达了这里的某个位置
and then caned it along here

876
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,119
到现在为止我还没发现他的踪影
and I simply haven't caught him yet.

877
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,039
但我还是怀疑
But I've got a good suspicion

878
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,879
当我们抵达圣特鲁佩斯时
when we get to Saint-Tropez,

879
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,599
还会有大堵车让我有机会逮住他
there'll be more traffic and that is where I'll find him.

880
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,559
我正准备把这艘78英尺长的游艇停泊进圣特鲁佩斯港
I'm about to park my 78-foot boat in Saint-Tropez harbour.

881
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:46,999
这是我目前唯一需要慢下来的事
This is the only slow bit,

882
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,559
圣特鲁佩斯港内必须减速
the wobbling about in Saint-Tropez harbour.

883
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,559
因为这里有愚蠢的限速规定
'Cause they've got some stupid speed limit.

884
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,959
（海鸥鸣叫）
(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)

885
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,639
噢，亲娘，看这场面
Oh, good God, look at this.

886
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,799
-（喇叭） -交通状况。大塞车
-(HORNS HONKING) -Traffic. That's a big jam.

887
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,119
噢！
Oh!

888
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,959
蛇形前进，借过，借过
Squeezing through, coming through,coming through.

889
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,799
克拉克森：当哈蒙德
CLARKSON: As Hammond weaved his way

890
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,519
在圣特鲁佩斯车阵中龟移时
through the annual Saint-Tropez trafficjam...

891
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,359
噢，我的天
Oh, my God.

892
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,999
克拉克森：...我还在等海港调度员腾个船位出来
CLARKSON: ...I was still waiting to be given a parking space.

893
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,639
借过，借过，借过
Through, coming through, coming through.

894
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,319
（哈蒙德大笑）
(HAMMOND LAUGHS)

895
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,719
巴黎饭店，想死你了
Hotel de Paris, I thank you.

896
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,599
伙计！
Mate!

897
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,279
怎么样？
How are you?

898
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,079
哈蒙德：怎么可能...
HAMMOND: How...

899
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,079
老天，你看起来汗津津的
God, you look sticky.

900
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,079
这是搞什么鬼？
How the bloody hell?

901
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,039
我都没遇见过你。一次也没
I didn't see you.I didn't see you once.

902
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,119
我看见了一辆法拉利F12，我以为是你
I saw a Ferrari F12,I thought it was you.

903
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,039
事实是
Thing is

904
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,279
虽然你有摩托车驾照
you've got a motorcycle licence.

905
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,079
-没错。-但是，我却有
-Yes.-Well, now, I have

906
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,719
游艇驾照
a boat licence.

907
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,239
也就是说，显然，明天
And what this means, of course,is tomorrow,

908
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,919
你将要穿上一件非常拉风的T恤...
while you'll be wearing a T-shirt and that'll be cooler...

909
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,039
啊，我差点忘了还有这么件事
Ah, I forgot about that.

910
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,599
...T恤上会写着“我爱詹姆斯·梅”
...it will say "I love James May" on it.

911
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,799
（克拉克森坏笑）
(CLARKSON LAUGHING)

912
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,559
第二天早上，哈蒙德没显出一点着急
The next morning,Hammond was in no hurry

913
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,319
离开酒店的意思
to leave the hotel.

914
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,119
-哈蒙德。-干嘛？
-Hammond. -What?

915
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,079
-哈蒙德，出来吧。 -不
-Hammond, come out. -No.

916
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,679
不，我还要...我还没...我还在打包
No, I'm a bit...I haven't... I'm just packing my bag.

917
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,439
-已经8点45分了。-好啦，我只是在给我的行李打包
-It's quarter to 9:00. -Yeah, I'm just packing my bag.

918
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,759
我在打包
I'm packing.

919
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,239
事实上，不，我感觉不是很好
Actually, no, I'm not very well.

920
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,479
现在外面没人
There's nobody here.

921
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,239
-我感觉不舒服。 -哈蒙德！
-I'm poorly. -Hammond!

922
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,279
哈蒙德：好了。我出来了
HAMMOND: Right. I'm coming out.

923
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,559
唔。
Ooh.

924
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,879
现在，你看
Now, look.

925
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,639
-这真是太糟了。 -没错
-This is bad. -Yes.

926
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,079
但我恐怕还有比这更糟糕的事情
But I'm afraid the news gets even worse.

927
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,559
还有什么事能比我这件T恤更糟
It can't be any worse.

928
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,439
我们被要求驾驶同一款车
We've both chosen the same car.

929
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,079
好吧，但听上去还不算太糟，不是吗？
Well, that's not so bad, is it?

930
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,759
-你意思是只有一辆车？ -没错
-You mean there's only one? -Yes.

931
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,679
所以，圣特鲁佩斯
So, Saint-Tropez,

932
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,479
敞篷宾利，两个大老爷们
convertible Bentley, two men.

933
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,759
噢，我们看起来简直...
Oh, we are looking...

934
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,079
（不约而同地笑）
(BOTH LAUGHING)

935
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,319
才明白怎么回事
Just realised.

936
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,199
克拉克森：两个老爷们坐在同一辆宾利里
CLARKSON: Two men in a Bentley.

937
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,599
问题不在于我们开的是宾利，我们应该认识这点
It isn't just the Bentley,we ought to make that plain.

938
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,999
而在于这是辆敞篷车
It's any convertible.

939
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,039
把任何两个大男人塞进一辆敞篷车里
Put two men in a convertible car,

940
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,319
然后打开敞篷，问题马上就显现出来了
take the roof off and instantly, questions are raised.

941
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,079
哈蒙德：幸运的是在车里，外人看不见我的T恤
HAMMOND: Still, at least in the car,they couldn't see my T-shirt.

942
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,479
直到...
Until...

943
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,959
为啥要停在这？
Why are you pulling over here?

944
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,039
我突然想逛逛街
I just want to have a look at something.

945
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,999
-逛什么？ -一些东西
-What? -Just stuff.

946
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,879
-什么东西？ -只是...我想欣赏那些船
-What stuff? -Just... I want to look at the boats.

947
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,959
哈蒙德：你究竟想干什么？
HAMMOND: What are you doing?

948
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,799
-这地方很漂亮。-我不要停车
-It's a nice place. -I don't want to stop.

949
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,959
-这里到处是人... -下车吧
-There's people...-Just get out.

950
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,199
-哈蒙德：不。-下来
-HAMMOND: No. -Yes.

951
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,399
-哈蒙德：不！-下车
-HAMMOND: No! -Yes.

952
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,959
不，我要找个洞钻进去
No, I'm going to hide.

953
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,879
我绝不下车。就躲在这
I'm not getting out.I'm getting in here.

954
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,399
那我只好一个人了
I'm on my own.

955
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,479
哈蒙德：噢，天啊
HAMMOND: Oh, God.

956
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,599
我要去散散步，把他扔开一会
I'm just going to go for a walk and leave him.

957
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,079
哈蒙德：主啊，赶快结束这一切吧
HAMMOND: Make this end.

958
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,479
我打赌输了
I lost a bet.

959
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,839
哦，天啊
Oh, God.

960
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,759
杰瑞米，我们能离开这吗？
Jeremy, can we go now?

961
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,439
克拉克森：不
CLARKSON: No.

962
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,559
这些船哪些有螺旋桨
Do any of these boats have propellers

963
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,919
并且马上就要离开的？
and are any of them likely to be running right now?

964
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,719
又见狗仔队。这里有很多偷拍的人。
Paparazzi again.There's quite a lot of paps here.

965
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,519
没错。所以我们走好吗
Yeah. So let's go.

966
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,919
哈蒙德：但是，我们遇到了点小麻烦
HAMMOND: There was, however,a small problem.

967
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,999
克拉克森：这里...哈蒙德：我们的车原来是停在这吗？
CLARKSON: Was it... HAMMOND: Is this where it was?

968
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,999
-是啊。-好吧，现在没了，怎么回事？
-Yes. -Well, it's not, is it?

969
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,119
我猜可能是这么回事
I tell you why it's not.

970
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,039
这里是禁止停车的，你觉得呢？
You can't park here, can you?

971
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,879
这里允许停车吗？你能在这...什么？
Can you park here? Are you allowed to... What?

972
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,959
好吧，显然这里是禁止停车的，而我们的车被警察拖走了
No, you can't park here or that's a picture of a car being towed.

973
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,159
-你知道吗，我实在是...-车是被拖走了对吧？
-Do you know, I genuinely... -Has the car been towed away?

974
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,759
好吧，看上去的确如此
Well, yes.

975
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,239
你在这等一会
Just you wait here

976
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,319
我把车要回来
and I'll go get it.

977
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,239
-放轻松。 -是啊
-Just relax. -Yeah.

978
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,519
离得不远，真的，一个小时就回
It's not far, actually,I'll be back in an hour.

979
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,319
我确定曾经某人也一定和我一样不爽
I'm sure somebody somewhere at some time has been unhappier.

980
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,599
别这样，别这样，别这样，别这样
Please, please, please, please.

981
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,079
别这么干，这一点也不好玩。
No, not funny. Not even halfway funny.

982
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,959
打开这该死的门。杰瑞米，开门
Open the damn door.Jeremy, open the door.

983
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,359
你怎么能这样？
How do you do that?

984
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,799
我上车了
I'm getting in.

985
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,239
克拉克森：现在，你们一定在疑惑
CLARKSON: Now, at this point you may be wondering

986
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,639
为什么我们被要求同乘一辆宾利
why both of us chose a Bentley.

987
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:40,079
好吧，事实其中一部分原因是它很漂亮
Well, partly it's because we think that these days, it looks good.

988
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,719
但主要原因是它性能出色
But mostly it's because it's now available

989
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,759
搭载了一台优秀，轻质，高亢的4升V8引擎
with a brilliant, lighter,louder 4-litre V8.

990
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,679
但这些优点在哈蒙德思维里都不是最重要的
Not that this was foremost in Hammond's mind.

991
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,279
-杰瑞米·克拉克森。-什么
-Jeremy Clarkson. -Yes.

992
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,719
你把我的座椅加热给打开了吧？
Have you put my seat heater on full?

993
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,919
是的，没错。
Yes, I have.

994
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,999
噢，伙计，这简直是...
Oh, mate, that's...

995
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,279
-是的，这就是真相。-噢！
-Yes! Result. -Oh!

996
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,639
太难受了。
Just horrific.

997
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,759
-这就是症结所在。-噢！
-That's a result right there. -Oh!

998
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,479
克拉克森：接着我发现了另一个原因
CLARKSON: Then I got another result.

999
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,679
一条干净，通畅的道路
A clear, open road.

1000
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,559
（伯明翰口音）“稳住你的脊椎”
(BRUMMIE ACCENT)"It's got a bit of poke."

1001
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,639
-哇噢！-噢，这才是它应该发出的声浪
-Whoa! -Oh, that's how it should sound.

1002
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,079
克拉克森：你认为这车感觉上去像什么？
CLARKSON: Do you know what it feels like?

1003
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,079
-一台跑车。-没错
-An sportscar. -It does.

1004
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,639
你把我的座椅加热给打开了吧？
Have you put my seat heater on?

1005
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,039
是的，没错
Yes, I have.

1006
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,479
（大笑）我真是太...
(LAUGHING) I'm really sor...

1007
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,159
这是一台速度机器
It's a machine, this.

1008
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,119
你好，极品飞车！
Hello, machine!

1009
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,399
其中一个我喜欢这车的原因是
One of the reasons why I like this car so much,

1010
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,719
你知道这车不只是贴了宾利的标志那么简单而已
you know it isn't just a Bentley badge,

1011
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,439
这车使用了最复杂的汽车工程技术
there's some properly difficult engineering that's gone into this car.

1012
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,279
杰瑞米，你又把我的座椅加热给打开了吧？你这个...
Jeremy, have you put my seat heater on again? You...

1013
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,919
-（笑）-这真不...我...
-(LAUGHING) -That's not... I...

1014
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,279
噢
Oh.

1015
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,079
如果我坐起来，外面的人就会看见我的T恤
And if I lift myself up,they can see my T-shirt better

1016
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,959
如果我坐下，我就热死了。天啊！
and if I sit down, I cook. God!

1017
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,399
克拉克森：所以，很棒的引擎
CLARKSON: So, clever engine,

1018
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,279
优秀的四轮驱动系统
clever four-wheel-drive system,

1019
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,239
这些真不错
looks a lot better these days.

1020
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,399
哈蒙德：迷人的声浪
HAMMOND: Great noise.

1021
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,599
克拉克森：没错
CLARKSON: Great noise.

1022
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,079
真是一辆好车
't's a great car.

1023
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,759
问题在于这车还是给人一种鲁尼的感觉
The problem it has still is that Rooney flavour.

1024
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,159
鲁尼的感觉就是说
The whiff of Wayne means

1025
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,479
当别人看见你驾驶着这车会让你觉得很尴尬
you do feel embarrassed to turn up in it.

1026
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,359
哈蒙德！
Hammond!

1027
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,639
不要再打开我的座椅加热
Stop putting my seat heater on.

1028
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,999
很快，抛开座椅加热，火辣的宾利，以及炙热阳光的问题
Soon, despite the hot seats,the hot car and the hot sun,

1029
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,799
车内的气氛变得十分低沉
the atmosphere became frosty.

1030
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,959
所以我们决定再次分开
So we decided to split up.

1031
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,479
接着我决定去看看附近一座历史悠久的古建筑
And then I decided to look at a building that had mostly fallen over.

1032
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,119
看这个
Look at this.

1033
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,359
看啊，这是一头野猪，这里
Yes, look, there's a wild boar,there we are.

1034
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,119
这是一幅狩猎图
This is a hunting scene.

1035
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,279
哈蒙德，这是一幅狩猎图！
Hammond, there's a hunting scene!

1036
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,159
哈蒙德！
Hammond!

1037
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,759
感觉这里原来是座陵墓
It's like there's a mausoleum

1038
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:55,159
-或者是个凯旋门之类的建筑。-不要和我讲这些，我不关心
-and a sort of triumphal arch. -Don't talk to me, I don't care.

1039
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,679
我不想听这些。我不想知道，我不想听！
I don't want to hear about it.I don't want to know, I really don't!

1040
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,759
这些让我恶心
I'm sick of it.

1041
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,799
这太荒谬了。我出来这一趟吃过了螃蟹眼睛
This is ridiculous.I've eaten crab's eyes,

1042
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,799
看过了故事里的阳台。说真的，这回该轮到我做主了
I've looked at a balcony from a story.No, seriously, it's my turn.

1043
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,959
这回我要决定我们接下来做什么
It's my turn to decide what we do next.

1044
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,519
我们接下来要跑一场拉力赛
And what we're doing next is going rally driving.

1045
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,039
-什么，就用玛莎拉蒂总裁？-不
-What, in a Maserati Quattroporte? -No.

1046
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,759
-和一辆劳斯莱斯幻影？-不
-And a Rolls-Royce Phantom? -No.

1047
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,839
我有个好主意
I've had a good idea.

1048
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,439
哈蒙德：这是桑布尔赛道
HAMMOND: This is the circuit Sambre,

1049
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:27,399
永无止境且严酷无比的一条法国拉力赛道
endless kilometres of unrelenting French rally stage.

1050
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,559
这个地方Stig很熟悉
And a place The Stig knows well.

1051
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,559
-什么？-是这么回事
-What? -Well,

1052
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,439
这里是Stig的避暑山庄，懂吗？
this is The Stig's summer retreat, yeah?

1053
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,599
他每年都来这里跑圈
He comes here every year and does that.

1054
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,079
-他说过...-你说跑圈是什么意思，跑什么圈？
-And he says... -What do you mean, he does that?

1055
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,719
是这样，冬天他去跑雪地比赛。夏天他来这
Well, in winter he goes ice racing.Summer, he comes here.

1056
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,999
连跑三周的拉力练习圈
Three weeks of that he does.

1057
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,119
-什么，一刻不停？-没错，坐进车，连续不断跑三个星期
-What, non-stop? -Yeah, gets in the car, three weeks,

1058
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,839
三个星期之后，下车，回家
and then three weeks later,gets out, goes home.

1059
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,639
这是他的度假方式。先不说这个，他同意我们借用
That's his holiday.Anyway, he says we could use it

1060
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:57,919
这条赛道跑几圈拉力赛
to do our rally driving.

1061
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,279
-现在太热了。-哈！
-It's too hot. -Dah!

1062
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:00,839
我已经考虑到了这一点
I have actually thought of that.

1063
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,279
-你喜欢敞篷车，是吗？-是的
-You like a convertible, don't you? -Yeah.

1064
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,839
那为什么我们不用敞篷车来跑一场拉力赛呢？
Why don't we rally-drive convertibles?

1065
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,279
-那会很脏。-现在，请跟着我做一件事
-It's too dusty. -Now, do one thing for me,

1066
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,079
我们去找些敞篷车
we're going to go and get some convertibles,

1067
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,599
然后把它们改装成拉力赛车跑拉力赛！
turn them into rally cars and do that!

1068
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,479
我不会跑拉力赛
I can't do rally driving.

1069
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,639
-这很简单，只要...-我不行！
-It's easy, just... -I can't!

1070
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,079
我不能在野地里开车...
I can't drive on loose surfaces...

1071
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,519
这就是我的座驾
This is what I've got.

1072
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,839
日产350Z
Nissan 350Z.

1073
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,599
3.5升V6引擎
Three-and-a-half-litre V6,

1074
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,759
276制动马力，后驱
276 brake horsepower, rear-wheel drive.

1075
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,599
现在，你看着这车，可能在想“好吧
Now, you might be looking at it, thinking, "Well,

1076
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,879
这车看上去不怎么像拉力赛车”
"it doesn't look much like a rally car."

1077
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,999
但先别急着下定论，这车有一个血亲
But hold on,this car is a direct descendant

1078
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,719
日产Datsun 240Z
of the Datsun 240Z,

1079
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,439
一款曾经横扫世界拉力锦标赛的名车
a car that owned world rallying.

1080
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,879
所以它有拉力血统
So this has got history.

1081
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,959
它会表现很出色
It's going to be brilliant.

1082
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,879
我找到一辆宝马
I've got a BMW.

1083
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,079
没有拉力血统，我选它因为我喜欢这车
No history of rallying at all,it's one of the reasons I like it.

1084
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,079
好吧，说说看，给观众介绍介绍这车的引擎？
Well, come on, tell us about it,what engine has it got?

1085
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,679
2.5升直列6缸
Two-and-a-half-litre straight 6.

1086
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,919
哈蒙德：排量比日产低了1000cc。动力呢？
HAMMOND: 1000cc less than the Nissan. Power?

1087
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,279
我猜大概192？
192?

1088
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,519
那也比我的车少了80马力。扭矩多大？
That's about 80 horsepower less.Torque?

1089
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,079
180牛米
180.

1090
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,479
-同样低了80。-很好！
-That's about 80 torques less. -Good!

1091
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,879
-你说很好啥意思？-很好！
-What do you mean, "good"? -Good!

1092
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,999
杰瑞米，你没有表现出真正的竞赛精神
Jeremy, you're not really getting into the competitive spirit of this.

1093
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,039
我不喜欢在没有附着力的地面上开车！
I don't like driving without friction!

1094
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,559
哈蒙德：敞篷拉力赛将会是下一个兴起的运动大项
HAMMOND: Open-top rally is going to be the next big thing.

1095
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,079
让我们开始改装我们的战车吧
Let's go and convert these into rally cars.

1096
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,079
接下来是激情改装加配乐时间
This meant finding a workshop and cueing the music.

1097
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,999
（过场音乐）
(THEA-TEAMTHEME PLAYING)

1098
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,759
克拉克森：搞定
CLARKSON: Got it.

1099
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,519
噢，很好
Oh, yes.

1100
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,679
老天，我真天才
God, I'm good.

1101
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,279
这会让我的战车小宇宙爆发
That will make up for the horsepower deficit

1102
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,799
哈蒙德的车上也有这个
that I have on Richard's car.

1103
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,879
我是八月车神
This is August.

1104
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,039
请叫我四月骑士
Now Mr April.

1105
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,399
我的防滚架完工
My roll-cage is complete.

1106
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,039
哈蒙德：第二天，我们的车都已蓄势待发
HAMMOND: The next day,our cars were ready.

1107
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:33,479
-老天爷也很给面子。-（电闪雷鸣）
-And so was the sky. -(THUNDER CRACKING)

1108
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,199
万事俱备，只欠东风
This is alljust fantastic.

1109
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,719
突然间，完美的拉力天气也即将降临
Suddenly, perfect rallying weather is coming.

1110
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,759
一点点雨水，泥土，山间的薄雾
Bit of rain, mud, mist on the hills,

1111
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,079
我的车已经准备就绪
and my car is now perfect.

1112
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,239
并没有爆改
Haven't gone over the top with the modifications.

1113
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,639
只是换了新轮毂，新轮胎，加装了防滚架
New wheels, new tyres, roll-cage,

1114
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,999
赞助商贴纸，不能用真的
sponsorship stickers,can't have real ones,

1115
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,639
这是BBC的规定，但我们尽可能营造真实气氛
BBC objects, but we've made 'em up to put you in the mood.

1116
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:03,719
内部，拉力座椅，多点式安全带，足够了
Inside, racing seat,full harness, that's enough.

1117
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,639
这会是一次另人惊叹的比赛
This is going to be amazing.

1118
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,359
我就是学着他的样子依葫芦画瓢而已
I just copied him.

1119
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:14,159
现在他准备开着他的日产在泥地里撒欢了
And now he's going to drive about in his Datsun in the mud.

1120
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,719
哈蒙德：他说的没错，我已经迫不及待了
HAMMOND: He was right, I couldn't wait.

1121
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,079
噢，真爽！
Oh, yes!

1122
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,199
真的下雨了，我在跑拉力赛。太完美了！
It's actually raining, I'm in a rally.This is perfect!

1123
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,119
（哈蒙德大笑）
(HAMMOND LAUGHING)

1124
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,239
在尝了那么多愚蠢的食物，看了那么多破砖烂瓦后
After all the stupid food and looking at rocks,

1125
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:49,199
我终于干了一件让我兴奋异常的事...
to come out and do something genuinely exciting and real and...

1126
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,519
我又充满了激情
I've come alive.

1127
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,799
哦，太棒了！
Oh, yes!

1128
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,079
（雷神大作）
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

1129
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,719
哈蒙德正在这样的大雨里在外面抽风
Hammond is out now in that.

1130
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,319
他简直疯了！
The man is insane!

1131
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,839
来吧，再下大点。来啊！
Bring it on, let's have more. Come on!

1132
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,599
这也叫下雨？
You call that rain?

1133
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,039
（大笑）
(LAUGHING)

1134
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,439
（大笑）喔！
(LAUGHING) Oh!

1135
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,519
现在这里是这个世界上我最喜欢的地方
This is my favourite place in the world now.

1136
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,519
（雷雨交加）
(THUNDER CRACKING)

1137
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,639
哈蒙德：啊哈！
HAMMOND: Ah!

1138
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,919
抱歉，哈蒙德，给我解释解释
I'm sorry, Hammond,do try to explain it to me,

1139
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,079
我实在难以理解
'cause I'm struggling to get it.

1140
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,799
这是本次旅程中我干过最爽的事情了
It's about the most fun I've had in a very long time.

1141
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,439
我能理解为什么Stig经常来这了
I can see why The Stig comes here.

1142
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,399
-你全身是泥。-是的
-You're covered in mud. -Yeah.

1143
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,959
-外面雷雨交加。-是的，我知道
-There's a massive thunderstorm raging. -Yeah, I know.

1144
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,999
我明白，没有比这更好的天气了。太完美了
I know, even the weather's better here.It's perfect.

1145
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,199
你说更好是什么意思？
What do you mean, it's better?

1146
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,999
（雷声）
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

1147
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,359
（开门声）
(CAR BEEPING)

1148
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,239
-哈蒙德，我一定要这么干吗？-是的
-Hammond, do I have to do this? -Yep.

1149
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:54,399
（叹气）今天我做主，这就是我们今天的任务
(SIGHS) It's my thing today,and this is what we're doing.

1150
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,519
克拉克森：就这样，为了表现出我是个多么大度的人
CLARKSON: Andso, to show what a good sport I am,

1151
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,319
我逼着自己出发了
I obliged.

1152
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,759
噢，上帝啊！
Oh, God's truth!

1153
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,639
噢！真疼
Oh! That hurt.

1154
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,999
真难受...
So, discomfort...

1155
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,799
噢！真是太恶心了！
Oh! That's just horrible!

1156
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,079
危险
Danger.

1157
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,399
悲惨，湿冷
Misery, cold.

1158
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,879
打滑让我只能开到21英里的时速（34公里）
Slithering around at 21 miles an hour.

1159
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,239
哦，不！见鬼...
Oh, no! Bloody...

1160
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,599
我洗了个泥水澡
I've just had a brown shower.

1161
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,519
原本以为这一圈就结束了
That really was the final straw.

1162
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,799
（雷声）
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

1163
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,639
后来才发现噩梦远没结束
And then it turned out it wasn't.

1164
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:42,639
好的，刚才是热身圈，我们已经熟悉了赛道，对吧？
So, we got the hang of it,we now know the course, yeah?

1165
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,919
现在开始跑计时赛
Time for timed laps.

1166
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,039
-什么？-是的，现在开始跑计时赛
-What? -Well, we do timed laps now,

1167
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,439
这才是正题。我觉得我们每人再跑上十圈
that's what we do.I reckon if we do 1 0 each

1168
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,639
就能得出谁是最优秀的车手
and then we can just work out how consistent we are,

1169
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,319
在成绩上一见高低，怎么样？
where we can just shave those extra seconds out, yeah?

1170
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,919
明天，我会请你吃
Tomorrow, you are going to eat

1171
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,159
野熊的蛋蛋
a badger's left teste.

1172
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,839
克拉克森：结果，我们全然不顾外面的瓢泼大雨
CLARKSON: Andso, flying in the face of common sense,

1173
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,719
又回到了赛道上
we got back out there.

1174
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:16,279
计时赛，所以这回是动真格的
Timed laps now, so it's really critical

1175
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,239
要勇敢地踩下油门
to just be brave enough to keep that power in.

1176
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,439
（哈蒙德大笑）
(HAMMOND LAUGHING)

1177
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,959
克拉克森：计时赛有什么意义？
CLARKSON: What's the point of timed laps?

1178
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,039
他比我多80马力...噢！...比我多得多
He's got 80 more horsepower...Oh! ...more than I have.

1179
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,359
他比我更擅长玩这个
He's better at it than I am.

1180
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:34,119
他配置了限滑差速器
And he's got a limited-slip differential.

1181
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,519
我什么都没有
I haven't got one of those.

1182
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,279
所以每当我过弯，我的一个轮子就会打滑
So, when I go round the corner,one wheel spins and that's it.

1183
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,759
哦嚯！天啊，当你做出完美滑行的时候那感觉太爽了
Woo-hoo! God, it feels good when you get it right.

1184
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,399
哇噢！
Whoa!

1185
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,399
噢!哦，我的天！
Oh! Oh, my!

1186
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,279
（大笑）
(LAUGHING)

1187
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,159
他也会...
He will have been...

1188
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,359
噢，看见他了，我能从这里看见他的大白牙
Oh, here he comes,I can see his teeth from here.

1189
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:07,079
好的，拉力赛的弯道超车。真有意思
Right, overtaking on a rally stage.This is interesting.

1190
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,319
克拉克森：噢，他超过了我！
CLARKSON: Oh, he's coming through!

1191
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:15,119
噢，不！丑陋的伯明翰小矮子超过了我！
Oh, no! The hideous little Brummie has torn past!

1192
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,319
啊哈！追上你了！
A-ha! Got you!

1193
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,839
噢，他居然这么干...噢，他全都做到了
Oh, he's done it...Oh, he's just made everything

1194
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,439
更糟的是，我看不见任何东西
much worse now, I can't see a thing.

1195
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,799
一片模糊
Muddy goggles.

1196
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:30,839
（呻吟）
(GROANS)

1197
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,159
我真想把他弄成残废
Every bone in his crotch,that is what I'm going to break.

1198
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,119
（大笑）
(LAUGHING)

1199
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,479
喔！
Oh!

1200
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,519
克拉克森：很快，天气变得越来越糟
CLARKSON: Soon, the weather got so bad,

1201
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,999
甚至哈蒙德也看不清赛道了
even Hammond couldn't see where he was going.

1202
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,159
见鬼！见鬼！噢！
Shit! Shit! Oh!

1203
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,239
克拉克森：因此，他提议先暂停，享用一顿拉力午餐
CLARKSON: So, he suggested we stop for one of his special rallying lunches.

1204
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,559
唔。尽情享用
Mmm. Okay, tuck in.

1205
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,839
-真的？-唔-唔
-Really? -Mmm-hmm.

1206
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,999
这是法国本地的特色热狗
'Cause this part of France is famous for its hotdogs.

1207
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,959
这上面抹了法式芥末酱
It's got French mustard on it.

1208
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,519
-是的...-等等
-Yeah... -Wait a minute.

1209
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,599
什么？
What?

1210
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,799
你知道这热狗肠里都是些什么吗？
You do know what's in that sausage, don't you?

1211
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,519
-香肠。-猪蹄子
-Sausage. -Pigs' toenails,

1212
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,599
猪的睫毛...
eyelashes...

1213
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:28,159
闭嘴快吃。趁你享用美食的时候，我手里已经有咱俩的成绩了
Shut up and enjoy it. And, anyway, while you enjoy it, 
I've got the timings here.

1214
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,959
我在1分16秒，13秒之间
I'm around the 1:16, 1:13,that kind of mark.

1215
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,799
-唔-唔。-你的成绩在1分53，46...
-Mmm-hmm. -You're 1:53,1:46...

1216
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,679
克拉克森：泥巴都进到我的耳朵里了！
CLARKSON: I've got soil in my ears!

1217
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:40,919
1分35，1分40...基本上，可以看出
1：35,1：40... Basically, what this is showing is that I am clearly

1218
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,999
我比你快得多
a lot better at this than you.

1219
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,439
-我要和你再打个赌。-什么？
-I'll do you a deal. -What?

1220
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,359
我们再跑一圈。
We will do one more lap.

1221
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,559
生死战
Do-or-die lap.

1222
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:52,119
如果我赢了，我立马消失
If I'm faster, we leave immediately.

1223
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,399
-如果你比我快？-是的
-If you're faster than me? -Yes.

1224
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,079
好吧，但如果我更快，我们就玩到天黑
All right, well, if I'm faster,we carry on till dark.

1225
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,239
-你能做到？-唔-嗯
-You'll do that? -Mmm-hmm.

1226
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,319
-认真的？-嗯-嗯
-Seriously? -Mmm-hmm.

1227
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,039
好吧
All right.

1228
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,079
哈蒙德：我第一个出发
HAMMOND: I went first.

1229
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,999
（法语）
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1230
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,279
我们出发了
And we're off.

1231
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,679
好的，现在，我不止要击败他，我还想羞辱他
Right, now, I don't want to just beat him, I want to humiliate him.

1232
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,759
噢，是的！这才对
Oh, yes! That was correct.

1233
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,319
噢！
Oh!

1234
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,039
驶过一个大坑
That was a monstrous dump from below there.

1235
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,919
上帝也加入了这场角逐
Nature is joining in with us now.

1236
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,719
噢，这真是太有趣了
Oh, this is just epically good fun.

1237
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:47,839
（碰）
(THUDS)

1238
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,759
完事，杰瑞米，我觉得你如果比我慢上一分钟
All right, Jeremy, I reckon if you get within a minute of that,

1239
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,079
我都会错愕不已。你没机会的
I'll be staggered. Not a chance.

1240
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,199
克拉克森：我胸有成竹地
CLARKSON: Filled with determination,

1241
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,239
把车停在了起跑线
I lined up the BMW on the start line.

1242
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,959
（法语）
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1243
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,359
好的，我要赢下这场比赛
Right, I am going to win this

1244
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,719
这样我们就能结束这无聊的一切
and then we can stop doing it.

1245
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,439
这里...哦！等等
That's... Oh! Hang on a minute.

1246
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,999
很好！
Yes!

1247
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,559
你觉得怎么样？
What do you think of that?

1248
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,439
悄悄的。是的！
Sneaky beaky. Yes!

1249
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,239
（克拉克森奸笑）
(CLARKSON LAUGHING)

1250
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,839
是的！
Yes!

1251
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,559
上帝是站在我这边的
The gods are on my side.

1252
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,399
这将是伟大的一圈！
This is going to be one hell of a lap!

1253
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,279
我们汇合对比成绩
We then met up to see how we'd done.

1254
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:04,839
理查德·哈蒙德，你成绩是1分17秒3
Richard Hammond, you did it in one minute,17.3.

1255
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,319
-虽然不是我最快的成绩但也不错。-很好，这是个标杆
-Not my fastest but not bad. -Well, it was a standing start.

1256
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,319
是的，确实，当然是的。没错，继续，你的呢
It was, yes, of course it was.Yes, go on, then.

1257
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,919
-我的成绩，28秒...-然后？
-Me, 28 seconds... -Yes?

1258
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:13,959
一分多少？
One minute what?

1259
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,319
就是28秒
28 seconds.

1260
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,319
你的一分在哪里...
How did you find a minute in the...

1261
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,959
-我想说...-因为我是车神
-I mean... -Ultimate driving machine.

1262
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,999
以及优秀的宝马Z4
And a BMW Z4.

1263
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,519
是嘛？
Really?

1264
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,639
克拉克森：我立刻走人
CLARKSON: I left immediately.

1265
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:38,839
开始完成去到波城的最后350英里（563公里）
And set off on the 350-mile drive to Pau

1266
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:43,039
驾驶着一辆阿斯顿马丁V12
in a V12 Aston Martin.

1267
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,239
哈蒙德，则开着一辆大众甲壳虫（新911）
Hammond, meanwhile,was in a Volkswagen Beetle

1268
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,239
而气氛，依旧阴沉
and moaning, as usual.

1269
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,079
他作弊的手段越来越下流
His cheating is getting out of control.

1270
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:58,399
这一切都因为他用Stig作弊和超近道变得毫无意义
There's no point doing anything if he's just going to borrow The Stig

1271
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,679
这是他这些天做的所有下三滥事情
or cut a corner, which I can only imagine is what he did in that instance.

1272
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:06,479
他一定只跑了一个弯道，连作弊都做得这么没技术含量！
It must have been one hell of a corner, he can't even cheat well!

1273
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:11,479
我承认我超的近道确实短了那么一点点
I admit my shortcut was a bit short.

1274
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:15,359
而且圈速确实离谱了那么一丢丢。但是你瞧
And the time was a bit implausible.But look,

1275
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:20,039
天气变好了而且我现在开上了阿斯顿马丁征服
the weather is improving and now I'm in an Aston Martin Vanquish.

1276
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:31,239
这是一辆高贵华丽的车
This is a truly magnificent car.

1277
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,799
至今为止最棒的阿斯顿
Best Aston yet, by a long way.

1278
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:37,399
它柔和了DBS的刚猛
It's a blend of the hardcore DBS

1279
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,639
也借鉴了Virage的舒适
and the slightly softer Virage.

1280
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,319
这真是极好的
It's just tremendous.

1281
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:46,319
现在我要把镜头交给哈蒙德
And now I shall hand you over to Richard Hammond,

1282
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,599
他会向各位解释为什么他开的911
who shall try to explain why the Porsche 911

1283
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,479
在某些方面和前N代的版本
that he's driving is in some way different

1284
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,239
有所不同
to all the Porsche 911s that have gone before.

1285
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,519
（转速声）
(REVVING)

1286
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,879
他怎么能说911都是一个样？
How can he go on about 911s all being the same?

1287
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,639
让我给大家揭揭阿斯顿马丁系列的老底
Let me talk you through the Aston Martin range.

1288
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,559
Vantage V8, V12 Vantage
Vantage V8, V12 Vantage,

1289
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:11,159
DB9, DBS, Virage,以及前面那货
DB9, DBS, Virage, that,

1290
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,079
它们事实上都是一回事
they're all exactly the same.

1291
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,239
阿斯顿马丁设计出了一款车
Aston Martin came up with the design,

1292
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,759
觉得，“噢，这车看起来真漂亮”
thought, "Oh, that looks pretty.

1293
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:20,839
“让我们给它起N个名字这样就会有更多人买它了”
"Let's call it lots of different things and then more people will buy it."

1294
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,279
他开的车就是这么个玩意
It's just another one.

1295
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,639
C2, C2S, C4, C4S
C2, C2S, C4, C4S,

1296
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:32,719
GT2, GT3, Turbo, 997, 996, 993...
GT2, GT3, Turbo, 997, 996, 993...

1297
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,119
新一代911被称作911
The new 911 is called the 991 ,

1298
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,159
它比前作更长更宽
it's longer and wider than the previous 911 .

1299
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:42,839
搭载了新款发动机，新型变速箱，新的内饰，以及新的转向系统
It's got a new engine, new gear box,new interior and new steering.

1300
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,319
这是个有争议的点，有史以来
This is the critical point,for the first time,

1301
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,759
保时捷第一次用电子转向系统取代了纯液力转向机构
the steering is electric rather than purely hydraulic.

1302
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,679
正当我兴致勃勃的讲解时
Just as I was getting into the groove,

1303
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,199
杰瑞米又把车开下了高速路
Jeremy pulled off again.

1304
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,279
又要干啥？
What now?

1305
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:05,279
这样，既然明天就要抵达波城了，我认为
Well, I thought it would be a good idea,since we're at Pau tomorrow,

1306
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,639
我们应该体验一回高附着力赛道
to reacquaint ourselves with the concept

1307
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,519
的驾驶概念
of driving while under the influence of friction.

1308
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:11,839
我不喜欢摩擦力
I don't like friction.

1309
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,039
波城，伙计。那可是波城
Pau, mate. It's Pau.

1310
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,799
那里从1901年就开始举办比赛了
They've been racing there since 1901 .

1311
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,799
范吉奥曾经驰骋在那
Fangio has raced there,

1312
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:23,159
吉姆·克拉克，杰基·斯图尔特。那是座名城
Jim Clark, Jackie Stewart.This is a big deal.

1313
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:29,359
那里是...对车迷而言那里就和伯利恒在基督世界的地位一样神圣
（伯利恒：巴勒斯坦中部城镇，相传耶稣和大卫的诞生地）
This is... It's Bethlehem for any motoring enthusiast.

1314
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,959
那这和我们要去的地方有什么关系？
So, what's it got to do with that?

1315
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,679
我们要先在这里热热身
We've got to get match fit.

1316
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,759
然后明天当我们真正去到波城时...
And then when we get to Pau tomorrow...

1317
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,839
-我们就会不虚此行。-嗯-嗯
-We'll be worthy of it. -Mmm-hmm.

1318
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,319
（引擎声）
(ENGINES REVVING)

1319
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,599
克拉克森：在大直道上，我热血喷张
CLARKSON: Straightaway,I was very happy.

1320
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,119
赛道没水，也没泥土
No wet track, no mud,

1321
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,479
没有下雨，也没有白喉（白喉：一种急性呼吸道传染病）
no rain, no diphtheria.

1322
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:07,799
这是一条又窄又曲折的短小赛道
This is one tight and twisty little track.

1323
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,399
好的，现在，让我们把这辆阿斯顿
Right, now, let's turn the Aston

1324
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:20,519
从公路车变成赛道怪兽
from a road car into something more track-based.

1325
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,519
我要按下这个按钮，这会提升悬挂的支撑力
We'll push this button here,that firms up the suspension,

1326
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,719
接着按下这个按钮，S，我想这是代表“愚蠢”的意思
and then push this one,S,I think it stands for "silly".

1327
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,439
因为你按下它之后...准备好了吗？
'Cause when you push it... Ready?

1328
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,759
整辆车都变了“嗯，什么？”这就像是对一条宠物狗发出命令“走！”
The whole car goes, "Hmm, what?"It's like saying "walkies" to a dog.

1329
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:32,919
“噢，你确定？走你？”
"Oh, really? Walkies?"

1330
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,679
（引擎声）
(REVVING)

1331
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:44,199
这车的引擎和经典的阿斯顿马丁征服上那款一模一样
This has the same basic engine that was fitted to the original Vanquish.

1332
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,439
而那款车的竞争对手是法拉利550
And that was comparable at the time to the Ferrari 550

1333
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,039
和575
or 575.

1334
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:53,639
从那以后，法拉利前进了许多，如今他们拥有了F12
Since then, Ferrari have moved on,they're at the F12 now.

1335
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,639
（轮胎啸叫）
(TYRES SCREECHING)

1336
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,119
这货甚至连双离合变速器都没有
This doesn't even have a double-clutch gearbox.

1337
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,999
还是一台老旧的七速序列式变速器
It's an old 7-speed slushmatic.

1338
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,919
每档切换都像一位老管家慢慢地为你送至面前
Each gear is delivered by an elderly butler.

1339
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,959
“我想要三档，贾维斯”“好的，先生，我马上
"I'd like third now, Jeeves.""Certainly, sir, I'lljust

1340
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,759
为您送上三档。我想它一定被收藏在我的橱柜里，
"pop off and get it.I think it's in my pantry.

1341
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,199
三档来了，先生。”
"There you are, sir."

1342
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,159
虽然在公路上很平顺，但在赛道上却不是那么回事
Very smooth,lovely on the road, not brilliant here.

1343
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,839
这车感觉像一艘方舟
It's a bit of an ark, this.

1344
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,559
华而不实
It's a very pretty ark.

1345
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,919
但当你把它摆进一个弯道时...
But when you stick it into a corner on a track...

1346
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,799
你能感受到在这碳纤维车身的外表下
you know that beneath the carbon fibre body,

1347
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,439
一切都似曾相识
everything's a bit old.

1348
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:54,279
倒不是说旧就不好，正如你所看到的一样
Not that there's much wrong with old, as you can see.

1349
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,599
与此同时，在距我千里之外的某处...
Meanwhile, far behind...

1350
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,279
哈蒙德在他的911里体验着生死时速
Hammond was revelling in the new 911 's grip.

1351
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,239
天呐，这抓地力太惊人了
God, this thing is planted.

1352
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,039
依旧是熟悉的3.8升水平对置6缸引擎
Still a 3.8-litre flat six,

1353
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:24,959
依旧被安装在车尾，依旧短小紧凑
it's still mounted at the back of the car, it's still compact.

1354
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,119
最大的不同，就是它的这套电子转向系统
The big issue, though,is that electric steering.

1355
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:38,679
感觉它没在和我交流。它没有...它应该通过前轮的轻微滑动
It's not talking to me. It's not...It should be telling me everything

1356
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,519
来为我提供详尽的路感
by going slightly light at the front under power.

1357
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,719
也就是说前轮相比较其它的普通汽车
It means the front wheels can move around a little bit more

1358
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,519
应该再提升些许的自由度
than they would in an ordinary car.

1359
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,599
并且方向盘的回馈感应该告诉我这些信息
And the steering wheel should be telling me about that,

1360
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:55,039
所有这一切会让我知道这是一辆911
that's what lets me know it is a 911

1361
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,359
而不是一辆R8或者一辆捷豹
and not an R8 or a Jaguar.

1362
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,519
这车感觉像911吗？
Does it feel like a 911?

1363
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,919
我不这么认为
I don't think it does.

1364
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,799
到了波城，我希望有一辆比911更出色的车型
And for Pau, I want something that's more of a 911.

1365
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,239
我也想到了自己到底想要的是什么
And I've had a very good idea for that.

1366
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,399
我应该选这辆车
I shall be using this,

1367
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,079
全新的保时捷911 GT3
the brand-new Porsche 991 GT3.

1368
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,799
我非常渴望驾驶它
I am desperate to drive it.

1369
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,159
因为它质量更轻，底盘更低，速度更疯狂
It's lighter, lower, faster.

1370
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,839
它就是我的独角兽
This is my unicorn,

1371
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,959
我的女神
my Helena.

1372
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:45,479
克拉克森：GT3或许在这里很强大
CLARKSON: Track-focused the GT3 may be,

1373
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,919
但到了波城，它连我座驾的尾气都吃不到
but at Pau, it would be no match for my choice.

1374
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,519
单座BAC Mono跑车
The single-seater BAC Mono.

1375
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,879
Top Gear赛道有史以来最快纪录车型
One of the fastest cars ever to take on the Top Gear test track.

1376
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:06,719
纯粹简约，极度轻量化，异常敏捷，一流的平衡性
Purity simplified,light, agile, balanced.

1377
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,439
简称完美
Perfect.

1378
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:15,279
就当工作人员为我们重要日子的用车做检查之时...
As men set about fettling our cars for the big day...

1379
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:24,999
我们又重温了一遍本次旅行用到的各种
we ruminated on all the boats and bikes and cars

1380
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,519
游艇，摩托车，跑车
that we'd used on ourjourney.

1381
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,199
-哈蒙德！-（笑）
-Hammond! -(LAUGHING)

1382
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:37,359
我们也试图找出一款最优秀的交通工具
And we tried to work out which one we'd liked the best.

1383
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,879
（尖叫）
(SCREAMING)

1384
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:47,079
我喜欢那辆福特嘉年华ST，我真的很喜欢
I loved that little Fiesta ST,I really did.

1385
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,519
我喜欢驾驶那辆福特T型车，虽然它开起来很疯狂
I actually loved driving the Model-T,crazy though that is.

1386
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,759
我喜欢那辆杜卡迪
I enjoyed the Ducati.

1387
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:57,119
但出于某些原因，法拉利F12给我留下了很深的印象
But for some reason, the Ferrari F12 has really stayed with me.

1388
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:00,639
我认为它既高贵又漂亮而且还很快！
I thought it had presence and drama and it's fast!

1389
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:05,479
我不会选SLS因为它体积太大，不适合日常使用
I wouldn't have the SLS 'cause that's too much to use every day.

1390
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,359
高尔夫GTI又太小了
Golf GTI isn't quite enough.

1391
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:13,079
布加迪威龙，我是说它又是另一个级别的产物了
Bugatti Veyron, I mean it's the other end of the scale, then.

1392
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,879
高出太多。宾利...
Too much. Bentley...

1393
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:20,159
噢，是辆不错的车但是...我想出来了我喜欢什么
Oh, it's a great car but...I've worked out what I'd have.

1394
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,679
丽娃Aquarama（那艘豪华游艇- -#）
The Riva Aquarama. (LAUGHING)

1395
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,279
-那是你最喜欢的车？-是的
-That's your favourite car? -Yes.

1396
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:29,279
如果我天天用它，我估计得搬家
That's what I'd use every day.I'd have to move house.

1397
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,159
得出结论之后，我们爬进各自的爱车
With that decided,we climbed back into our road cars

1398
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,479
前往最后的目的地波城
for the final push to Pau.

1399
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,079
我们对前方的圣城是如此兴奋
We were very excited by what lay ahead,

1400
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:46,639
以至于我们不顾摄制组的后勤车一骑绝尘
so excited that we left the camera crew far behind.

1401
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:50,959
当他们再次赶上我们的时候，我们遇到了一点小麻烦
And when they finally caught up with us,there was a bit of a problem.

1402
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,479
（警察无线电通讯，模糊不清）
(POLICE RADIO CHATTER, INDISTINCT)

1403
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,799
克拉克森：你是说，护照？
CLARKSON: You mean, passports?

1404
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:00,759
噢，好吧
Oh, right.

1405
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:04,279
那边的法国男警官和女警官
The French policemen and lady policemen

1406
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,839
坚持让我们交出随身携带的所有的现金（难道遇上劫道的了...）
insisted that we should give them all our money.

1407
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,919
最后经过漫长的交涉
And then after quite a long chat,

1408
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:14,239
他们决定如果我们不在法国驾车就允许我们入境
they decided it would be best if we didn't drive in France any more.

1409
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,799
好吧，就这样
Yeah, okay.

1410
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:28,199
随着这则爆炸性消息，又到了节目结束的时候
And on that bombshell,it is time to end.

1411
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,479
非常感谢各位的观看，再见
Thank you very much for watching,goodbye.

1412
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:33,119
你这个白痴！
You total plonker!

1413
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:45,719
我不想搭标致或者波罗
I don't want to go in a Peugeot or a Polo.

1414
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,999
或是这辆沃克斯豪尔赛飞利
Or this Vauxhall Zafira.

1415
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,989
搭顺风车的人能这么挑剔吗？
Can you be picky when you're a hitchhiker?

1416
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:60,789
我觉得可以。这有太多车可以选择了
I should think so.There's plenty of choice.

1417
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,039
不想上那辆雪铁龙
Don't want to go in that Citroen.

1418
01:24:14,038 --> 01:24:24,039
