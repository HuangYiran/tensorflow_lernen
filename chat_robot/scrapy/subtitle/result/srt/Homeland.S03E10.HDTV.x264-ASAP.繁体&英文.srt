15
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,150
我們不容科威特遭受侵略
This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait.

16
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,060
對于恐怖襲擊的不懈打擊
This relentless pursuit of terror.

17
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,120
我們將一視同仁
We will make no distinction...

18
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,500
美國軍艦科爾號
The USS Cole was attacked

19
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,920
在亞丁灣港口加油時遭到襲擊
while refueling in the port of Aden.

20
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,940
這是恐怖主義行動
This was an act of terrorism.

21
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,790
這是可鄙懦弱的行動
It was a despicable and cowardly act.

22
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,720
下面為您演奏的
The next samba we're going to swing for you

23
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,720

24
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,250
直到他受到了阻擊
...until something stops him.

25
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,050
整個事件就發生在我的眼前
It was right in front of my eyes,

26
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,050
而我絲毫沒預料到
and I never saw it coming.

27
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,370
該飛機撞向了世貿中心

31
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,300
又最愚蠢的人
I've ever known.

32
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,810
我不是不明真相的那個人
I'm not the one who got it wrong.

33
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,980
我是唯一的明白人

拿下

《國土安全》前情提要

00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,960
那個襲擊者是唯一可以證明布洛迪清白的人
The bomber's the only way to prove that Brody's innocent.

38
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,850
你他媽要干啥  卡莉
What the fuck are you doing, Carrie?

39
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,460
卡莉  馬上回去
Carrie, turn around now.

40
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,490
這是對你的最后警告
This is your last warning.

41
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,380
她左上臂受了槍傷

大出血  可能是射穿動脈了
Significant bleeding. Might have clipped an artery.

43
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,480
索爾在他媽什么地方
Where the fuck is Saul?

44
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,820
我們沒想到他會變成那樣
He's not what we expected.

45
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,730
但他是我們唯一的籌碼
But he's what we've got.

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,820
這家伙有毒癮
The guy's a junkie... sir.

47
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,520
我給你一個機會  再次成為海軍陸戰隊員
I'm offering you the chance to be a Marine again.

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,520
不要再來了  我...
No more. I...

49
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,160
我已經完了
I'm done.

50
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,870
我設了個局
I have a play.

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,600
牽涉到了布洛迪
It involves Brody.

52
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,300
-你告訴過我賈瓦迪是個局  -他是
- You told me Javadi was the play. - He is.

53
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,930
布洛迪是下一步
Brody's the next phase.

54
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,870
什么局  你有什么好主意
So, what is it? What's your big idea?

55
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,510
達尼什·阿克巴里
Darnish Akbari.

56
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,020
伊朗革命衛隊的首領
Head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.

57
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,110
對
Right.

58
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,100
賈瓦迪的上司
Javadi's boss.

59
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,740
他還是和平的最大障礙
And the single greatest impediment to peace.

60
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,230
我想除掉他
I want him gone.

61
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,710
布洛迪能接觸到他
Brody can get to him.

62
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,090
照索爾說的做
Do what Saul's asking.

63
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,320
-你希望我這么做  -對  是我希望你這么做
- What you're asking? - All right, what I'm asking.

64
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,760
瞧我這副樣子  卡莉
Look at me, Carrie

65
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,260
你現在讓我出去買包煙都成問題
You couldn't send me out for a pack of cigarettes right now.

66
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,720
我們會幫你做好準備
We'll get you ready.

67
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,730
但要你愿意配合才行
You just have to be willing.

68
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,140
他們押送我至邊境處
The guys get me to the border

69
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,490
然后我示意投降
where I surrender myself?

70
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,990
沒錯  選擇馬里萬郡
Correct, and we chose Marivan, 

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,710
是因為很多基地組織指揮官
because several Al Qaeda commanders

72
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,450
同樣在那里尋求政治庇護
also asked for political asylum there.

73
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,980
你憑什么認為我能夠接近
What make you think I'll ever get close enough

74
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,720
阿克巴里將軍并完成刺殺
to General Akbari to take him out?

75
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,800
賈瓦迪將作為引薦人
Javadi's on the ground.

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,170
安排你和將軍的會面
We'll facilitate a meeting between the two of you.

77
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,360
我會從德黑蘭回來的
I will come back from Tehran.

78
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,660
我知道
I know you will.

79
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,540
不只是為了她
And not just for her.

80
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,330
布洛迪
Brody?

81
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,510
到那邊再見
See you on the other side.

82
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,390
卡莉
Carrie.

83
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,920
我想跟你談談
We need to talk.

84
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,970
談什么
What about?

85
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,360
你的肩膀怎么樣了
How's your shoulder?

86
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,970
煥然新生
Brand fucking new.

87
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,440
我想跟你澄清一下汽車旅館那次
I want to clear the air after that clusterfuck with Franklin

88
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,930
狗操豬的破事
at the motel.

89
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,690
我沒興趣
I'm not interested.

90
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,870
這些鬼話早聽膩了
I'm so tired of all the bullshit

91
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,260
都他媽明哲保身  沒法和你說
and people covering their asses, I can't even tell you.

92
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,710
是直接命令  卡莉
It was a direct order, Carrie.

93
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,110
我是怕別人開這一槍
I didn't want to risk letting someone else take the shot.

94
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,860
你手術時候
While you were in surgery,

95
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,900
我看了你的病例
I took a look at your medical records.

96
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,490
什么
You what?!

97
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,200
我擔心給你那槍的傷勢
I was worried about the damage I'd done.

98
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,940
卡莉  你懷孕十五周了
Carrie, you're 15 weeks pregnant.

99
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,090
-那又怎么  -我想
- So? - So, I think

100
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,870
你應該考慮退出這次行動
you should consider sitting this part of the operation out.

101
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,240
為什么
And why would I do that?

102
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,330
因為在這種情況下
Because it's impossible for you to be objective

103
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,720
你無法客觀行事
under the circumstances.

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,350
你指的是  我懷了布洛迪的孩子
The circumstances being, I'm carrying Brody's child?

105
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,520
對
Yes.

106
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,280
第一  這孩子不是他的
Well, first of all, it's not his,

107
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,030
謝謝擔心  第二
thank you very much. Second of all,

108
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,720
這不關你屁事  不關任何人的事
it's none of your damn business, or anyone else's,

109
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,830
所以別他媽多管閑事
so just stay the fuck out of my way.

110
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,450
伊拉克  距兩伊邊境6.4公里

111
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,780
半熟
Medium rare?

112
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,470
味道挺他媽不錯吧
Pretty fucking tasty, huh?

113
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,400
不錯
Hmm... hmm. Yeah.

114
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,530
秘訣就是在宰羊之前
The secret is to relax the goat

115
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,180
讓它們放輕松
before you cut his throat.

116
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,680
所以莫達勒斯才死得那么慘
Which is why Modarres has lockjaw and sore knees.

117
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,990
{\an8}莫達勒斯:反對卡扎爾王朝的政治家  
被毒死在監獄中

118
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,640
他們怎么樣
How are they doing?

119
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,360
很好  順利通過庫爾德人聚居區
Good. That move across Kurdistan was uneventful.

120
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,800
目前
Now...

121
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,950
他們在這里
that's them right there.

122
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,880
等待日落  到時候
They're waiting for nightfall, at which point,

123
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,310
他們直接把他送到邊境那里
they'll drive him right up to the border here, 

124
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,050
掩護他越過伊朗那邊的
cover him across to the manned checkpoint

125
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,990
武裝檢查站 就在這里
on the Iranian side, right there.

126
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,900
總統現在最擔心
The risk of an international incident

127
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,430
引起國際爭端的風險
is a serious concern for the president.

128
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,860
我們決不辜負對他的承諾
We stand 100% behind what we told him.

129
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,100
此次行動值得冒險
The risk of this operation is worth the reward.

130
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,550
萬一出了什么岔子
And in the unlikely event anything goes wrong,

131
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,450
也瞞得住
we have it covered.

132
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,560
我可不想知道你們搞的那套
I'm not even going to ask what that means.

133
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,800
今晚他要做的
All he has to do tonight

134
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,510
就是過境  并尋求避難
is walk across the border and ask for asylum.

135
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,560
就這樣
That's it.

136
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,560
在陸戰隊學的嗎
Is that a Marine thing?

137
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,210
襪子翻個面  干面朝里
Turn the socks inside out, get the fresh side.

138
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,440
哪有干面啊
Well, there is no fresh side.

139
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,080
一面濕了  另一面也完蛋
One side's sweaty, and the other's just dirty.

140
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,720
也許是我忘不掉吧
Well, maybe it's just all in my head.

141
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,300
有用嗎
Does it work?

142
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,250
你看我
Well, look at me.

143
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,230
煥然一新了

乘客怎么樣
How's the passenger doing?

156
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,740
不錯
Not bad.

157
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,790
對于一個"鍋蓋頭"來講
For a fucking jarhead.

158
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,030
好的  A隊結束通話

他入境點是哪里

161
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,290
基恩  請把邊境圖片拿過來
Hey, Gene, can you bring up the border photos, please?

162
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,490
馬上
Coming up.

163
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,350
兩小時前的
Yeah, as of two hours ago,

164
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,240
有個八人的兵營  某中士指揮  
one barrack hut for eight men, commanded by a sergeant.

165
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,560
路邊防哨由倆攜自動武器的士兵
Roadside guard hut manned in four-hour shifts

166
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,570
每四小時輪值

167
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,420
伊邊巡隊無線電通信有新情況嗎

每小時互相通話一次

169

171
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,820
八個無聊饑渴的大兵
Eight bored and hungry conscripts

172
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,890
通話記錄被我們盡收眼底
whose radios we're dialed into.

173
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,100
這樣就不會低估他們的實力了
No chance of underestimating them then?

174
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,750
說得好
Fair point.

175
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,120
最后再說一遍你的臺詞
Let's go over your cover story one last time.

176

中情局爆炸后
After the bombing,

177
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,600
納齊爾的人在那附近留了輛車
Nazir's network left a car near Langley,

178
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,850
我把車開進加拿大邊境的森林里
which I took into the woods on the Canadian border,

179
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,180
我剃了頭  繼續步行
where I shaved my head, and I continued on foot.

180
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,700
在那偷了艘船穿過芬迪灣
There I stole a boat across the Bay of Fundy

181
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,850
到達新斯科舍  遇到了一個
to Nova Scotia, where I met a guy

182
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,230
和阿莫·艾馬蒂有聯系的人
who had ties with Amer El-Maati,

183
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,670
他把我裝進集裝箱送往哥倫比亞
who put me in a shipping container to Colombia.

184
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,910
然后  真主黨雇傭兵

把我送到委內瑞拉

終于把我送上一架國有石油公司的飛機
where they finally put me into a state oil company plane

187
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,460
飛往伊拉克
to a strip in Iraq,

188
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,240
把我交到基地組織手里
where I was handed over to an Al Qaeda cell

189
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,810
他們的任務就是讓我穿越伊朗邊境
who were tasked with getting me across the border to Iran.

190
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,430
加入基地組織  游遍世界各地
Join Al Qaeda, see the world.

191

夜視儀畫面傳輸中

193
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,550
口香糖沒了  你那還有嗎
I'm out of Black Jack. Any more out there?

194
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,590
一切還好嗎  長官
Everything okay, sir?

195
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,060
最后一包了嗎
This the last pack?

196
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,610
給你買了很多
I got you plenty more.

197
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,790
別擔心
Don't worry.

198
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,870
你寫信了嗎
Did you write a letter?

199
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,680
什么
What?

200
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,730
寫給家人

201
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,760
說再見的信
To say good-bye.

202
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,800
我寫了你們肯定會知道
Pretty sure you guys would know if I did.

203
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,420
你應該找那你中情局的朋友
You could've arranged it with your, uh, 

204
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,130
那金發妞  幫你安排一下
CIA friend, the blonde.

205
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,210
你還好嗎
How you doing?

206
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,130
很好  你呢
Good. You?

207
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,980
好像是在維加斯把房子都賭上了
Feel like I'm in Vegas betting the mortgage.

208
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,540
準備好了  大伙們
Stand by, people.

209
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,080
好戲上演
Show time.

210
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,160
死神一號怎么回事

傳感器帶寬故障

很常見  我們正在重置

213
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,730
一切順利  用不了幾分鐘
All being well, shouldn't be more than a couple minutes.

214
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,860
"一切順利"嗎
"All being well"?

215
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,540
要等無人機重連他們才能行動嗎
Are we holding the team back until the drone's back on line?

216
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,920
無人機是給我們用的
That drone's mainly for us.

217
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,460
他們有衛星電話和夜視儀
They have satphones and night vision.

218
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,130
他們沒有無人機也能向邊境移動
They can move closer to the border without it for now.

219
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,370
-糟糕  -怎么
- Shit. - What?

220
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,780
去邊境的路可以說被封鎖了
Road to the border's as good as blocked.

221
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,290
外國人賄賂當地官員換取免費天然氣
Foreign gas trucks paying off local officials with free gas.

222
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,490
警察  軍隊  你能想到的都受賄了
Cops, military, you name it, all on the take.

223
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,630
邊境在哪
Where's the border?

224
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,660
從這條路穿過他們還有1.6公里

225
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,970

伙計們  下車
Guys, get out.

231
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,340
讓路過的人看起來是車壞了
Make it look like car trouble for anybody passing.

232
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,490
我們有備用計劃  對吧
We have a backup plan, right?

233
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,200
我們等總部確認備用路線
Yeah. We're waiting for Langley to confirm the alternate route.

234
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,080
現在需要用無人機  能不能用
Now, I need that drone. Are we gonna have it or not?

235
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,350
收到
Copy that.

236
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,240
他們怎么這么慢
What's taking them so long?

237
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,450
不知道  他們的無人機出了點故障
I don't know. They had a technical with the drone.

238
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,630
那我們得在這坐多久
So how long are we gonna sit here for?

239
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,860
靠  老兄  你比我孩子還煩
Shit, man, you're worse than my kids.

240
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,550
天  那些躲在后方的傻逼
God, those Rear Echelon motherfuckers.

241
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,000
無人機出問題了
Got a problem with the drone.

242
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,590
開局真不錯
That's a good start.

243
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,200
死神回來了
Reaper's back.

244

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,380
現在看看那條入境的備用路線

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,290
又嚼你的幸運口香糖了嗎

251
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,800
是啊  來一片嗎

該死
Shit.

253
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,510
把頭低下
Put your head down.

254
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,300
裝睡就行了  別動

00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,350
晚安
Good...night.

288
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,750
喂
Hey...

289
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,320
你怎么樣
You okay?

290
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,090
布洛迪  你還好嗎
Brody? You good?

291
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,110
喂
Hey.

292
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,040
-你他媽的干啥  -我不行
- What the fuck are you doing? - I can't do it.

293
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,910
-你行  -不  我不行
- Yes, you can. - I can't. No.

294
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,030
-他媽的  我真不行  -你非行不可
- I can't. No, I fucking can't. - And you will.

295
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,820
我真他媽的不行...
I fucking can't. I fucking...

296
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,900
現在裝得像個雛兒似的已經晚了
Bit late in the day for your vagina to chime in.

297
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,270
滾犢子
Fuck off...

298
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,200
你害怕了
You scared?

299
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,030
你他媽的害怕了嗎
Are you fucking scared?

300
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,210
我
I'm...

301
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,630
-我怕了  真怕了  -好啊
- I'm scared. I'm scared. - Good.

302
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,940
我也怕  我見過太多人
Me, too. I've seen way too many men

303
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,890
死在這種第三世界國家的廁所里了
killed out here in this Third World toilet.

304
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,390
他們每次送我回這里  我都嚇得拉褲子
I personally shit myself every time they send me back here.

305
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,570
如果你現在不振作點的話
And if you don't snap out of this right now

306
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,790
我們今晚就得死在這
we could all fucking die here tonight.

307
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,360
你想這樣嗎
Is that what you want?

308
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,130
不
No.

309
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,590
告訴我你會沒事的
Tell me you're gonna be okay.

310
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,130
告訴我這還算不上走投無路
Tell me that this is not the end of the road for you.

311
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,900
不  我要聽你親口說
No, no, no... I need to hear you say it.

312
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,940
我會...
I'll be...

313
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,300
我會沒事的  我沒事
I will be okay. I'm okay.

314
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,440
我很好
I'm okay.

315
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,680
我會好的
I'll be okay.

316
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,010
A小隊  有狀況嗎
Kilo-Alpha, is there a problem?

317
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,280
"乘客"暈車了
Passenger got carsick.

318
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,560
他吐了一場  我們要準備出發了
He threw up and we're ready to roll.

319
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,830
暈車
Carsick?

320
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,110
這條是安全通訊線路
It's a secure sat link.

321
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,180
能不能告訴他們別說胡話
Can you tell them to just cut the bullshit?

322
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,510
他沒事嗎
Is he gonna be okay?

323
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,340
他他媽的會好的
Fuckin'- he's gonna be okay.

324
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,730
給你
Here.

325
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,330
把你臉上的血擦擦
Wipe the blood off your face.

326
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,150
A小隊
Kilo-Alpha,

327
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:27,320
B小隊  前進至候補交叉點
Kilo-Bravo, proceed to alternate crossing point.

328
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,790
知道了
Roger.

329
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,000
A小隊出發
Alpha out.

330
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,700
剛才那三個伊拉克警察到底有沒有被我們殺掉
Did we or did we not just kill three Iraqi police officers?

331
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,960
是庫爾德游擊隊  別斤斤計較
Kurdish--not to split hairs.

332
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,690
殺沒殺掉都不需要告訴總統
Either way, this isn't something the president needs to know.

333
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,670
我理解  相信我
Oh, I understand. Believe me.

334
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,300
立刻幫我接特戰司令部指揮官
Get me JSOC Commander now.

335
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,820
自兩伊戰爭以來  這片區域
This whole area is pretty much a no-man's land

336
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,600
幾乎成了無人區
since the Iran-Iraq War.

337
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,740
有人來了
We got visitors.

338
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,560
-參議員  將軍  -局長
- Senator. General. - Director.

339
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,710
-白宮...  -我知道
- The White House... - I know.

340
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,450
-他們告訴我你要來  -讓我把話說完
- I was told you were coming. - Let me finish.

341
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,070
白宮派費思特將軍和我來監察指導
The White House sent General Fister and me to advise and observe.

342
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,350
監察指導
Advise and observe.

343
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,680
聯合特種作戰司令部指揮官
The JSOC commander,

344
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,640
負責指導  我受總統任命...
to advise; myself, the President's nomin...

345
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,700
這次行動  希金斯是怎么跟你說的
What did Higgins tell you about the operation?

346
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,210
行動要雷厲風行  悄無聲息
That this part was meant to be quick and silent 

347
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,110
兵不血刃
and bloodless.

348
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,020
他全告訴你了  是嗎
He told you everything, didn't he?

349
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,310
是的
Yes, he did.

350
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,830
-包括...  -布洛迪中士嗎  沒錯
- Including...? - Sergeant Brody, yes.

351
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,290
索爾
Saul...

352
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,210
無論行動結果如何
whatever this turns out to be,

353
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,590
是英勇的神來之筆或者怎樣
bold stroke of genius or otherwise,

354
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,890
都將注定由我來接手
I'm destined to inherit it.

355
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,980
所以既然行動已經開始了
So now that it's actually in motion,

356
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,060
不管怎樣
for better or for worse,

357
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,280
我只能希望行動圓滿成功
I have no choice but to wish it every success.

358
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,110
能借一步說話嗎  參議員
A word in private, Senator?

359
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,590
失陪一下  比爾
Excuse us, Bill.

360
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,660
好的
Of course.

361
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,450
說好了給我留的空間呢
What about the breathing room you agreed to give me?

362
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,260
當時說得是  我推遲任職聽證會
The deal was that I delay my confirmation hearing,

363
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,280
我照做了
which I've done.

364
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,450
我履行了義務
That obligation has been fulfilled.

365
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,050
你該感到幸運  索爾
Consider yourself lucky, Saul,

366
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,460
是希金斯給我們打的電話  而不是總統
that Higgins called us and not the president

367
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,730
或是他的國家安全顧問
or his National Security Advisor.

368
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,040
收到
Copy that.

369
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,490
收到
Copy.

370
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,140
-麥吉森女士  -參議員
- Ms. Mathison. - Senator.

371
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,870
肩膀怎么樣了
How's your shoulder?

372
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,720
醫生告訴我你非常幸運
Doctor told me you were very lucky.

373
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,220
我很好  多謝關心
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

374
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,710
我只能說你一定是名出色的推銷員
All I can say is you must be one hell of a salesperson

375
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,490
竟然能說動布洛迪這么做
to get Brody to do this.

376
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,980
在中情局  這叫招募
Here at the Agency, we call that recruiting.

377
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,010
給你看看
Here. Take a look.

378
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,900
離邊境還有一千五百米
Border's a click and a half away.

379
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,970
經過那棟建筑還有三百碼
300 yards past that building.

380
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,920
那是條淺溪  寬十二碼
All it is a shallow stream, 12 yards across.

381
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,730
聽著  我開車把你送到那里
Listen... I'm gonna drive you right up to it

382
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,850
我們都會看著你的
and we're all gonna be watching you.

383
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,480
你趟過那條河
You wade across that river

384
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,840
朝著那邊的林木線走
and you head up to that treeline on the other side.

385
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,150
你一到那里  跟著林木線向北走三英里
Once you hit it, follow it north for three miles

386
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,600
回到伊朗的檢查站
back to the Iranian checkpoint

387
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,640
也就是我們本來打算把你送到的地方
where we were originally gonna drop you.

388
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,450
你去哪里
Hey, where you going?

389
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,660
小便
Piss.

390
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,340
跟著他
Go with him.

391
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,720
我們收到了潛在的不明無線電
We got potential bogeys.

392
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,190
作戰小隊向南三千米
Two Iraqi Army Hummers

393
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,120
有兩輛伊拉克軍方悍馬
three clicks south of our call sign.

394
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,970
A小隊  向南三千米有兩輛伊拉克的悍馬
Kilo-Alpha, we have two Iraqi Hummers three clicks south,

395
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,740
不是重大威脅但需要注意
it's not a significant threat but be aware.

396
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,690
A小隊收到
Alpha roger.

397
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,580
向南三千米發現一支伊拉克巡邏隊
All right, we got an Iraqi patrol three clicks south.

398
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,270
沒什么大礙但那邊地勢復雜
It's not that big a deal but it's difficult terrain out there

399
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,190
所以我們得迅速安靜小范圍移動
so we got to move quick, quiet and small now,

400
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,560
那意味著只有我和他走
which means it's just me and him from here.

401
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,560
其余的人留在這兒作掩護
Rest of you guys stay here, cover from this position.

402
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,340
有問題嗎
Questions?

403
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,270
準備好了嗎
Ready?

404
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,990
好了
Yeah.

405
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,340
在你小時候
When you were a little kid,

406
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,740
你長大想干什么
what did you want to be when you grew up?

407
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,570
我不記得了
I don't remember.

408
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,900
胡扯
Bullshit.

409
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,020
每個人都記得
Everyone remembers.

410
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,470
你不必再管我了  老兄
You don't have to manage me anymore, man.

411
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,940
我知道來這兒干什么
I know what I'm here to do.

412
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,070
只是聊聊天嘛
Just making conversation's all.

413
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,100
那是什么
What's that?

414
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,150
沒什么
Nothing.

415
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,730
那你想干什么
Well, what did you want to be?

416
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,080
我在德克薩斯州長大的
I grew up in Texas.

417
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,960
我只想騎公牛
All I wanted to do was ride bulls.

418
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,980
你為什么沒騎公牛
Yeah, why didn't you?

419
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,230
我騎過了
I did.

420
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,530
騎過兩年
Two years.

421
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,480
騎得我"蛋"疼
But my nuts couldn't take the beating.

422
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,390
所以現在我改行做這個
So now I do this.

423
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,610
真他娘的開心...
Happy fucking...

424
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,200
剛剛發生了什么事
What just happened?

425
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,000
總部呼叫A小隊  完畢
Kilo-Alpha, this is Zero, over.

426
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,290
總部呼叫A小隊  完畢
Kilo-Alpha, this is Zero, over.

427
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,450
總部呼叫A小隊  完畢
Kilo-Alpha, Zero, over.

428
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,100
B小隊呼叫總部
Zero, this is Kilo-Bravo.

429
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,160
A小隊撞上了地雷或者簡易炸彈
Alpha hit something. A mine or an IED.

430
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,500
你能看到敵人嗎
Any hostiles on your screens?

431
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,990
稍等  正在查看
Stand by. Checking now.

432
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,290
目前沒有
Nothing, so far.

433
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,910
長官  那個伊拉克巡邏隊已轉向北邊
Sir, that Iraqi patrol

434
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,100
正朝爆炸處前進
just turned north, towards the explosion.

435
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,940
我們現在必須通知總統
Now we have to call the president.

436
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,470
等等  塵埃落定再說
Wait. Let the dust settle first.

437
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,410
不行  萬一有發生國際事件的可能
No, any possibility of an international incident

438
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,630
我就必須通知總統
I must call the president.

439
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,390
你必須做的是保持頭腦清醒
What you must do is keep a cool head

440
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,380
盡量不要驚慌失措
and take great care not to panic.

441
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,380
我們至少要通知伊拉克方面
Well, we at least have to call the Iraqis.

442
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,820
然后說什么
And say what?

443
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,660
讓你的巡邏隊繞開點
Turn your patrol around, 

444
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,690
我們有隊中情局特工  沒知會過你們
we have a CIA team we didn't tell you about,

445
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,220
就過去執行任務了
operating in the area?

446
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,180
那架無人機裝備了武器  對吧
That drone is armed, correct?

447
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,280
B小隊呼叫總部
Zero, Kilo-Bravo.

448
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,520
我們離A小隊近在咫尺
We're one click out from Kilo-Alpha.

449
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,640
收到  B小隊
Roger, Kilo-Bravo,

450
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,030
請注意伊拉克巡邏隊正在靠近你
be advised that Iraqi patrol is closing on your position.

451
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,520
長官  白宮來的電話
Sir, White House is on the line.

452
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,160
接到屏幕上
Put him on the screen.

453
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,650
邁克
Mike.

454
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,590
-我也許能解決這個問題  -請講
- I may have a solution. - Please.

455
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,480
無人機上裝備了四枚獄火導彈
That drone has four Hellfire missiles on it.

456
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,930
你是要我們跟伊拉克巡邏隊交火
You saying we engage the Iraqi patrol?

457
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,700
我的意思是我們發現有基地組織成員
I'm saying we just found an Al Qaeda cell

458
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,210
在幫美國頭號恐怖分子偷渡到伊朗
trying to smuggle America's most wanted terrorist into Iran

459
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,210
然后被我們的無人機干掉了
and we take them out with that drone.

460
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,350
上帝啊
Jesus.

461
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,470
如果他們死了這倒是個好主意
It's a smart play if they're dead.

462
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,230
他們要是沒死呢
And if they're not dead?

463
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,740
他根本不在乎他們的死活
He doesn't care whether they're dead or alive,

464
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,430
他娘的只想把自己摘干凈
all he fucking gives a shit about is covering his own ass.

465
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,150
-閉上你的嘴  卡莉  閉嘴  -操
- Bite your lip, Carrie. Bite it hard. - Fuck.

466
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,740
那個伊拉克巡邏隊馬上就到了吧
That Iraqi patrol is, what, a minute away?

467
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,750
我再說清楚一點  邁克
Let me be very clear, Mike.

468
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,640
我絕不會下令攻擊自己人
I will not order a strike on our own men.

469
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,740
掛了吧
Hang it up.

470
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,610
A小隊的車里有動靜
We've got movement in the Alpha vehicle.

471
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,050
要不是車輛剛剛啟動了
Either the vehicle just settled

472
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,860
那就是我發現了第二個移動的熱成像信號
or I have a second heat signature moving.

473
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,220
第二個信號確實在移動
The second figure is moving.

474
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,650
他們活著  他們都活著
They're alive; they're both alive.

475
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,190
我的腿
My leg.

476
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,440
干他娘的
Motherfucker...

477
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,000
我的腿
My leg.

478
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,080
不
No.

479
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,140
-他娘的我的腿  -坐起來
- My fucking leg... - All right, sit up.

480
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,020
快坐起來
Sit up, sit up.

481
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,590
雙臂交叉
Fold your arms.

482
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,560
跟我來
Okay, come with me.

483
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,180
電話  衛星電話
Phone, satphone.

484
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,490
A小隊呼叫B小隊  完畢
Kilo-Bravo, this is Alpha, over.

485
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,680
B小隊說話
Bravo, send.

486
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,790
我們在國境線西邊的建筑里
We're in the building to the west of the border,

487
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,560
敵方沒有開火  傷員仍然清醒
no enemy fire; casualty is still conscious

488
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,200
但他失去了一條腿并大量失血  完畢

在高地架設一組機槍手
Get a gun team up on high ground.

491
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,430
我能處理休克和緊急止血
I can treat for shock and stem the blood flow for now.

行動中  完畢
On it. Out.

494
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,530
想想你的孩子們
Focus on your kids.

495
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,370
傻逼  老子沒有孩子
I don't have any kids, dumbass.

496
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,410
我只是
I was just...

497
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,310
隨便說點什么  你他媽就像個小孩似的
making small talk 'cause you were being a fucking baby.

498
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,690
我們會把你帶出去的
We're gonna get you out of here.

499
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,200
煙
S-Smoke.

500
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,950
給我來支煙啊
Here, give me some of my cigarettes.

501
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,290
我他媽就沒料到會這么倒霉
I never thought I'd be this fucking guy.

502
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,980
我也沒料到
No, me neither.

503
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,440
我他媽搞砸了
I guess I fucked up, T.

504
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,100
那就喝兩杯
Beers on you, then.

505
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,520
我給他注射一劑嗎啡
I gave him one morphine shot.

506
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,600
還剩一劑
He's got one left.

507
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,810
我們得快撤了
We got to haul ass now.

508
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,140
抓住
Grab that.

509
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,560
這兒  放這兒
Here. Here... here.

510
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,590
轉身  回去
Roll... back.

511
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,810
行了
Okay.

512
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,160
-準備好了嗎  老大  -嗯
- Ready to do this, boss? - Yeah.

513
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,230
好  所有人都撤回到卡車那里
All right, everybody back to the truck.

514
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,580
走  快走
Go! Let's go, quick.

515
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,130
伊拉克巡邏兵剛剛加入戰局
Iraqi patrol just joined the party.

516
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,750
B小隊呼叫總部
Zero, Kilo-Bravo, contact!

517
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,080
南邊有自動武器射擊
Automatic fire from the south.

518
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,350
有一個排甚至一個連的火力
Platoon or possible company strength.

519
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,900
叫他們盡量緩住局勢
Do all you can not to escalate this.

520
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,810
克制還擊火力  控制火力
Suppressive return fire. Suppressive fire only.

521
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,130
別把狗逼急了  引開就好
Don't put them in the ground. Just turn them around.

522
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,210
B小隊呼叫總部  要是不趕緊救出阿齊茲
Zero, Kilo-Bravo, we don't get AZ out

523
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,850
-他就死定了  -伊拉克方面
- in the next few minutes, he's dead. - Iraqi call signs

524
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,410
向防線請求了火炮襲擊支援
are requesting an artillery fire mission up the chain.

525
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,090
離我們的直升機多遠
How far out are our helicopters?

526
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,450
八分鐘
Eight minutes.

527
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,570
將軍  您的意見
General, advice?

528
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,370
時間不夠
Eight minutes is time we don't have.

529
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,820
就算我們聯系伊拉克方面坦白事實...
Either we call the Iraqis and level with them...

530
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,450
時間也不夠
Also time we don't have

531
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,520
反正左右都是個死
and every shade of blowback we can't afford.

532
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,650
所以應該邊打邊撤  坐上他們之前的車
So it's a fighting withdrawal to a secure LZ,

533
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,440
退后五公里  回到安全著陸點
back five clicks in the vehicle that they have left.

534
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,180
也就是說  任務失敗
In other words, we have to abort.

535
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,750
情報行動結束
The intelligence operation is over.

536
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,860
現在這是一起軍事行動  由你指揮  將軍
It's a military one now. It's all yours, General.

537
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,900
謝謝
Thank you, sir.

538
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,190

Withdraw with Hellfire in support on your command.

544
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,310
我來下令  收到  等等
On my command, roger, wait.

545
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,000
他們要結束任務嗎
Are they aborting the mission?

546
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,730
索爾
Saul.

547
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,220
是你運氣不好
You had some bad luck.

548
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,150
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

549
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,640
至少我們還有賈瓦迪
At least we have Javadi.

550
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,540
局還沒破  還有希望
He's still in play. That's not nothing.

551
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,920
對
Yeah.

552
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,590
準備等待獄火支援  完畢
Stand by for Hellfire mission, over.

553
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,970
準備好了嗎
You guys ready?

554
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,170
撤退  撤退
Fall back! Fall back!

555
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,600
我不會撤退
I'm not going back.

556
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,080
媽的  你說什么  你必須撤退
What the fuck? What are you talking about? Yeah, you are.

557
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,960
我要穿過國界線進入伊朗
I'm gonna walk across that border into Iran

558
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,640
你別想阻止...
and you're not gonna to stop...

559
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:22,370
給我聽好了  我他媽的命令你撤退
Listen to me! I am fucking ordering you to fucking move out!

560
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,570
"乘客"拒絕撤退
Passenger refuses to withdraw,

561
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,310
時間不夠了  請指示
and I'm out of time. Please advise.

562
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,500
別留下任何一個人
Do not leave anyone behind.

563
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,130
火力太猛了
We are under heavy fire!

564
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,710
傷員優先
The casualty is priority one,

565
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,930
"乘客"他媽的不服從命令
and the passenger is non-fucking-compliant!

566
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,290
將軍  請指示
General, please advise!

567
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,960
讓我跟他說
Let me talk to him.

568
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,430
能說服布洛迪不去送死的  只有她了
If anyone can talk Brody down off a ledge, she can.

569
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,970
好吧
All right.

570
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,310
把對講機給"乘客"
Put the passenger on the line.

571
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,090
我再說一邊  把對講機給"乘客"
I say again, put the passenger on the line.

572
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,870
拿著
Take this.

573
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,050
拿著
Take it!

574
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,070
布洛迪
Brody?

575
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,780
布洛迪
Brody?

576
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,460
布洛迪  你聽得見嗎
Brody, can you hear me?

577
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,240
布洛迪
Hey, Brody!

578
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,530
他們想放棄任務  卡莉
They're trying to abort the mission, Carrie!

579
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,620
我知道
I know.

580
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,210
轉告他們操他媽的
Well, tell them to go fuck themselves.

581
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,650
不  聽我說
No, listen to me.

582
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,990
這件事你自己一個人做不到
You can't do this by yourself.

583
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,220
我距離邊界只有三百碼了  卡莉
I'm 300 yards from the border, Carrie.

584
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,530
我能完成任務
I can make it.

585
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:28,960
現在越界進入伊朗  你會完全孤立無援
Cross into Iran now and you will be completely on your own.

586
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,140
實話說  我這邊別無選擇
Well, to be honest I don't see much of an option here.

587
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,260
選擇撤退  重新部署
The option is to fall back, regroup,

588
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,270
之后我們會再組織行動
and we'll take another shot at this later.

589
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,680
拜托  卡莉  你知道那是不可能的
Come on, Carrie, you know that's not gonna happen.

590
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,060
你怎么知道
You don't know that!

591
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:43,140
現在  停止行動  好好考慮下
Now, stop and think this through.

592
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:46,120
你沒有許可  戰場上也沒有支援
You have no sanction, no support on the ground,

593
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,060
甚至沒有脫身計劃
and no extraction plan.

594
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,240
你會死在那里的
You will die over there!

595
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,300
不  你錯了  卡莉
No, you're wrong, Carrie.

596
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,580
你想知道為什么嗎
And you want to know why?

597
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,150
因為你會來帶我回去
'Cause you're gonna get me home.

598
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,050
不  不準那么說  不要把那強加給我
No, don't say that! Do not put that on me.

599
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,370
那簡直是白日夢
It's a fantasy.

600
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,680
你會想出辦法的
You'll find a way.

601
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,270
我對你有信心
I have faith.

602
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,740
就這樣  掛了
That's all. Out.

603
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,390
別  布洛迪  布洛迪
No, Brody! Brody!

604
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,140
操
Fuck!

605
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,840
我們現在要他媽撤出去
We are fucking moving out now.

606
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,140
所有人  我們走
All of us. Let's go.

607
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,430
我不走
Not me.

608
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,870
他跑了  操他媽
He's gone! Fuck him!

609
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,280
現在發射獄火  現在發射獄火
Hellfire, now! Hellfire, now!

610
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,720
獄火即將發射
Hellfire firing now.

611
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,460
現在行動
Move now!

612
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,040
抓住他
Grab him!

613
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,510
拿著這個
Take it.

614
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,160
你干嘛
What are you doing?

615
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,780
把他帶到著陸點  再來接應我  快去
Get him to the LZ, then come get me. Go!

616
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,750
操
Fuck!

617
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,210
他媽的狙擊手
Fucking snipers.

618
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,990
他們總是最操蛋的混蛋
Always the stubborn fucking assholes.

619
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,260
我能給你贏得三十秒時間  穿過邊境
I can buy you 30 seconds to cross that border

620
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,690
跑到那些樹那邊
and get to those trees.

621
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,220
我一開槍  你就跑
Once I start firing, you start running.

622
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,390
如果你停下  我他媽就開槍殺了你
And if you stop, I'll fucking shoot you myself.

623
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,920
有問題嗎
Any questions?

624
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,830
-沒有  -很好
- No. - Oh, good.

625
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,190
我數到三
Count of three.

626
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:59,840
一  二  三
One... two... three!

627
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,100
那什么情況
What is that?

628
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,900
他們被包圍了
They're surrounded.

629
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,140
被誰包圍了
Who by?

630
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,960
我們能從無線電中聽到什么嗎
Are we picking up anything on radios?

631
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,840
我是尼古拉斯·布洛迪
...Nicholas Brody.

632
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,230
我因為中情局爆炸事件

633
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,490
被美國通緝

634
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,720
我請求

635
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,940
在貴國得到政治庇護

636
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,810
那你呢

637
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,690
我幫他逃到伊朗

638
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:39,710
是基地組織成員嗎

639
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,700
是的

640
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,250
[波斯語]

641
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,520
[波斯語]

642
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,470
這些伊朗人說他們抓到兩個囚犯
The Iranians are saying they have two prisoners.

643
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,750
能肯定是伊朗人而不是伊拉克人嗎
Are we sure it's the Iranians and not the Iraqis?

644
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,090
百分百肯定
100%.

645
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,250
上帝
Jesus.

646
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,420
他們把傷員平安帶出來了
They got the casualty out safely.

647
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,410
他情況穩定  已經坐上飛機飛往航母了
He's stable, on a bird out to the carrier group now.

648
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,680
還有點別的事
There's something else.

649
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,110
什么
What?

650
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,660
布洛迪成功越境了
Brody made it across.

651
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,110
怎么做到的
How?

652
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,760
他抓緊時間一路狂奔
He made a last second run for it--

653
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,990
一頭沖進了伊朗的軍事基地
headfirst into an Iranian military unit.

654
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,390
他沒事吧
He's okay?

655
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,840
沒事
Yes.

656
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,530
他成功了
He made it.

657
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,990
你呢  索爾
And you, Saul,

658
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,590
還依舊身在局中
are still in the game.

659
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,340
我會下地獄的
I'll be damned.

660
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,340
現在  這些家伙
Right now, these guys...

661
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,860
他們訓練有素  將越境的任何人
uh, they're trained to treat anybody coming

662
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,850
都當成以色列特工
over the border as Israeli agents.

663
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,130
你被嚴刑拷打過
You were tortured...

664
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,950
告訴我接下來會怎樣
...so tell me what to expect.

665
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,080
做好受罪的準備
Expect to break.

666
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,410
你當時撐了多久
How long did you hold out?

667
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,630
我不知道
I don't know.

668
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,770
我很快就失去了時間意識
I lost track of time pretty much right away,

669
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,270
不過大概有
but I figure...

670
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,240
七天吧
seven days?

671
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,690
這些時間長得讓那些家伙
Enough time to allow the guys

672
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,970
改變了拷問頻率和行動計劃
to change their frequencies and battle plans.

673
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,810
我只是
I just...

674
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,710
希望能為你爭取到這七天的時間
I just hope I can give you seven days

675
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,460
讓你完成在德黑蘭的任務
to get the job done in Tehran.

676
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,340
你好
Hi.

677
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,530
我能坐下嗎
May I?

678
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,160
當然
Of course.

679
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,770
法拉  你是局里為數不多
Fara, you're one of the few people in this building

680
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,990
知道馬吉德·賈瓦迪是中情局線人的人
who knows that Majid Javadi's an Agency asset.

681
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,540
我沒告訴過任何人
I didn't breathe a word to anybody.

682
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,650
我知道你沒有  我不是為這個來的
I know you didn't-- that's not why I'm here.

683
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:19,140
但你在招募賈瓦迪的過程中扮演了重要角色
But you had a crucial role in recruiting Javadi.

684
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,620
事實上索爾說  要不是你  根本不會成功
In fact, Saul says, without you, it never would've come off.

685
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,060
他過獎了
He's exaggerating.

686
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,290
但還是謝謝你
But thank you.

687
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,870
問題是
The thing is...

688
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,560
賈瓦迪只是我們計劃的一部分
Javadi's only half the play.

689
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,760
而行動的另一部分
There's another phase of the operation

690
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,410
你之前并不知情
you weren't made aware of.

691
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,870
這關系到另一個線人  他的生死
It involves an asset, whose life depends

692
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,580
取決于我們能否在關鍵時刻從伊朗救出他
on us getting him out of Iran at the critical moment.

693
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,610
而我們原先的撤退方案
And the fact is our extraction plan

694
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,280
剛剛泡湯了
just went up in smoke.

695
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,360
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

696
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:52,250
法拉  你在德黑蘭有個叔叔
Fara, you have an uncle in Tehran.

697
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,800
是你父親的兄弟
Your father's brother.

698
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,360
-卡莉  不行  -你先聽我說
- Carrie, no. - Just hear me out.

699
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,290
不行  這太危險了
No, it's too dangerous.

700
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,680
-我們唯一的請求  -你們是在要求我
- All we're asking for... - You're asking me

701
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,670
將家人置于高度危險中
to put my family at extreme risk.

702
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,130
你很清楚這一點
You know you are.

703
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,510
你忘了我曾親眼目睹
You forget I've seen firsthand

704
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:08,040
行動是怎樣在瞬間偏離了正軌
how fast an operation can go sideways.

705
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,910
坦白說吧
Tell the truth.

706

你永遠不會讓你的家人冒這樣的險

有人來了  有人來了

我正式請求伊朗伊斯蘭共和國

720
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,870
為我提供庇護
in the Islamic Republic of Iran.

721
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,370
我知道你是誰
