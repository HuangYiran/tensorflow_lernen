00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,160
我叫Oliver Queen
My name is oliver queen.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,260
经历岛上地狱般的五年后
After five years on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,300
我回来了 心怀一个目标...

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,260
拯救这座城市
To save my city.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:16,330
但为此我不能再像以前一样杀戮
But to do so, I can't be the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:18,330
为了祭奠我的好友
To honor my friend's memory,

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,330
我必须重塑自己
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,760
我必须伪装自身
I must be something else.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,060
"绿箭侠" 前情提要...
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,300
尽管我也想让这座城市更安全
As much as I would love to make this city safer,

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,400
我的首要使命就是Queen公司
my first obligation is to Queen consolidated

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,800
你也一样
And yours is, too.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,930
我读了一些关于英国Lawton的资料
I did some reading up on Lawton.

14
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,200
Lyla 听着...
Lyla, listen...

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,330
你是真的认为我查不出
Did you really think I wouldn't find out

16
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,500
他杀了你哥哥?
that he killed your brother?

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,860
你以为我不知道你在利用我?
That you were using me?

18
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,500
我死要见尸
I need to see this guy in a bag.

19
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,060
你 还有所有人都该明白
You, of all people, should get that.

20
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,860
这么久
Long time

21
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,130
尤其是对Bratva队长来说
particularly for Bratva captain.

22
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,730
Queen先生
Mr. Queen.

23
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,400
Anatoly Knyazev这个人
Anatoly Knyazev,

24
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,360
对你评价很高
he speaks very highly of you.

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,300
应该如此 我救过他的命

这份报告
You were supposed to sign this report

29
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,460
昨晚开董事会的时候就该签了 为何没签?
at last night's board meeting. You know why you didn't?

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,300
可能因为我没参加昨晚的董事会
Probably because I didn't attend last night's board meeting.

31
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,860
你去哪了?
Where were you?

32
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,100
我在忙些公司之外的其他事
I have other interests outside of this company.

33
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,260
- 我不相信  - Queen先生...
- I don't.  - Mr. Queen...

34
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,400
你说我们是搭档
I thought you were serious

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,130
不是闹着玩的吧
when you said we were partners.

36
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,900
Isabel 我不过没参加一次会议而已
Isabel, I missed one meeting.

37
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,400
是这周一次
This week.

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,600
加上上周 就两次会议了
Last week, it was two meetings.

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,760
Queen先生
Mr. Queen.

40
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:33,660
自从我俩接手公司后
Company wide revenue is at double digits

41
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,630
公司收入就一直在两位数
since you and I took over.

42
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,860
- Oliver!  - 干嘛?
- Oliver!  - Yes?

43
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,100
抱歉打断你们...
I'm sorry to interrupt your...

44
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,100
呃!
Grr!

45
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,630
我想和你谈谈
Um, I need to talk to you

46
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,400
你今晚的安排
about your plans for this evening.

47
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,930
和Harper先生的约定
With Mr Harper?

48
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,700
我要失陪了
You'll have to excuse me.

49
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,060
我们还有工作要做
We have work to do.

50
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,030
工作很重要
It's important.

51
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,930
我今晚的计划也很重要
So are my evening plans.

52
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,930
对不起
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,500
得将计就计了
We are going to have to work on your excuses.

54
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,060
你说得对
You're right.

55
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,600
你太不小心了
You should be more careful.

56
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
你都完全暴露了
You're completely exposed.

57
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,400
我知道你在
I knew you were there.

58
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,900
怎么 你想等这些人交易的时候
What, you wanted me to tell you

59
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,760
再让我通知你吗?
when the funny money guys were ready to make a sale?

60
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,300
我们开始吧
Here we go.

61
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,600
不是"我们" 快回家
Not "we." go home.

62
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,300
我有帮手了
I already have help.

63
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,630
这是假币
Here's the fake.

64
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,030
给我们看看真钞
Let's see the real.

65
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,530
右上方有两个人
You got two right above you.

66
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,400
现在只有六个人了
Now they're just six.

67
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,260
待在原地 不许动!
Stay where you are, don't move!

68
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,560
我依法逮捕你 不许动
I want to make a citizen's arrest. Don't move.

69
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,530
好了 我搞定了
That's it. I'm clear.

70
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,260
啊
Aah!

71
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,130
知更鸟 X小队报告
Task Force x to mockingbird.

72
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,360
人已到手 准备归巢
We have the prize, we're coming home.

73
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,360
绿箭侠 第二季第六集

74
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,800
你们是什么人?
Who are you people?

75
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,360
国家安全局? 中央情报局?
NSA? CIA?

76
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,100
我是Amanda Waller
My name is Amanda Waller.

77
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,400
我以为阿格斯的人会更诡秘一些
I thought you ARGUS guys were supposed to be more subtle.

78
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,330
对于我们而言 这已经很诡秘了
For us, this was subtle.

79
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,460
- 我要见Lyla Michaels  - 我也一样
- Then I want to see Lyla Michaels.  - So do I.

80
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,030
Michaels探员已经下落不明了
Agent Michaels has gone dark.

81
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,160
Lyla失踪了?
Lyla's missing?

82
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,060
发生了什么事?
What happened?

83
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,300
她之前去莫斯科追查线索
She was running down a lead in Moscow.

84
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,060
原定两次电话汇报她都错过了
She's missed two of her scheduled call-ins.

85
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,200
那你这是在干吗?
Well, what are you doing about it?

86
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,730
在跟你说话
Speaking to you.

87
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,130
即使我们知道Lyla在俄罗斯的位置
Even if we knew where in Russia Lyla is,

88
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,300
我上司认为派营救小队过去
my superiors believe sending in an extraction team

89
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,230
可能会引发国际问题
could cause an international incident.

90
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,560
在他们看来
As far as they're concerned,

91
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,760
她已经成了照片墙上
she's already a framed picture

92
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,230
相框里的人
on our lobby wall.

93
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,730
为什么你要告诉我这些?
Why are you telling me all this?

94
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,360
因为我知道你和Oliver Queen夜晚的行动
Because I know how you and Oliver Queen spend your nights.

95
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,230
我还知道你的护照是最新的
And I know your passport is up to date.

96
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,130
这样有助于接手Lyla
It would help to start with what Lyla was doing in Moscow

97
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,730
在莫斯科做的事 她追踪的线索是什么?
in the first place. What was this lead she was tracking down?

98
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,860
关于Floyd Lawton下落的一行字
A line on the whereabouts of Floyd Lawton.

99
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,600
是致命一枪
Deadshot.

100
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,560
Lyla为了我才去的俄罗斯
Lyla was in Russia for me,

101
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,460
Michaels探员的位置无人替代
Agent Michaels is an asset I can't easily replace.

102
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,230
我知道对你而言 她同样不可替代
I know you find her similarly irreplaceable.

103
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,730
Diggle先生 把她带回来
Bring her home, Mr Diggle.

104
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,860
谢谢
Thanks.

105
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,860
上次抓你是好久之前的事了
It's been a while since I arrested you.

106
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,760
差点忘了这有多爽
I'd forgotten how good it feels.

107
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,800
我是... 他手下
I was working for... him.

108
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,560
他是谁?
Him who?

109
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,630
那个保护你的人
The guy who cost you your shield.

110
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,400
我是跟着他的 你也是
I'm on his team. You are, too.

111
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,130
还有谁看着比较眼熟?
Anybody else having serious deja vu?

112
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,360
就这样 我们放了他
That's all right, we're letting him go.

113
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,600
我们抓错了
Our mistake.

114
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,730
他在错的时间出现在错的地方
He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

115
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,560
好 趁着都还没改变主意
Ok, uh, let's just get out of here

116
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,660
咱赶紧离开这儿吧
before anyone changes their mind.

117
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,000
启动这个机器
The potentially catastrophic risk

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,700
潜在的灾难性风险
of turning on this machine

119
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,200
远远超过它可能带来的科学利益
far outweigh any scientific gain that might come from it.

120
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,530
大家需要了解
The people need to understand just how dangerous

121
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,460
这种高科技有多危险
technology like this is.

122
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,400
还有发生灾难性事件的真实可能性
And the very real possibility of a cataclysmic event.

123
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,200
你去哪了? 一切顺利吗?
Where'd you go? Is everything ok?

124
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,760
嗯 需要几天去办私事
Yeah. Just need a few personal days.

125
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,360
- 怎么了?  - 帮一个朋友
- What's going on?  - Have to help a friend.

126
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,900
谁?

127
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,530
帮Lyla Michaels

128
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,700
就是他在阿格斯的特工女朋友

129
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,500
她为了我去俄罗斯
She went to Russia looking for deadshot,

130
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,700
找致命一枪 现在失踪了
for me. Now she's missing.

131
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,360
Felicity啊...
Felicity...

132
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,330
咱们去参观Queen实业集团
I think it's time we visited our Queen Consolidated

133
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,430
- 在莫斯科的分公司  - 好
- subsidiary in Moscow.  - Yeah.

134
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,500
Oliver 你要干嘛?
Oliver, what are you doing?

135
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,830
帮个朋友而已
Just need to help a friend.

136
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,100
我不能要求你这么做
I can't ask you to do that.

137
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,030
不用要求
You didn't.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,060
Sara啊...
Sara...

139
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,630
我是Ivo
My name's Ivo.

你之前有没遇到过

接着在这个岛链上搁浅了

175
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,630
也就意味着只能由你...

176

来帮我们找到潜艇

178
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,030

198
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,830
- 这要看情况  - 看什么情况?

可她又不像你的表妹

那... 是... 绝对不可能的

除了一堆短裙

我是来做正经事的

Thea啊 你妈妈在受审呢
Thea, your mother is on trial for her life.

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,830
也不全是 我听说她想闯入监狱

- 为什么?  - 我不知道

253
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,730
但很明显她出不来了
But clearly she had issues breaking back out.

254
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,160
古拉格是俄罗斯最差劲的监狱
Gulag, worst in Russia.

255
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,830
大家叫它地狱
It's called koshmar.

256
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,300
噩梦
The nightmare.

257
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,030
那里聚集了暴力的心理变态狂
It's full of violent psychopaths

258
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,900
和杀手
and killers.

259
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,460
而这不过是守卫而已
And that's just the guards.

260
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,430
Anatoly 我们要想办法进古拉格救她出来
Anatoly, we need a way into the Gulag to extract her.

261
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,360
你进去之后 还没出来就被毙了
You get in, you get shot before you get out.

262
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
或者像你朋友那样被囚禁
Or end up like your friend.

263
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,300
所以不可能
Mmm, it's impossible.

264
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,800
唯一不可能的
The only thing that's impossible

265
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,060
就是我们救不出她 空手而归

266
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
我欣赏这家伙
I like this guy.

在俄文里 我们没有"乐观主义者"这个词
We have no word for "optimist" in Russian.

268
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,500
进去地狱的唯一办法
The only way in to koshmar

269
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,730
就是做囚犯
is as prisoner.

270
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,430
那里有个守卫欠我人情 
Now, I have guard there, owes me favor.

271
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,230
可能行得通 我会帮你们试试
It could work. I'll give you one shot in twenty.

272
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,330
- 安排一下 我去  - 不行
- Set it up. I'll go.  - No.

273
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,830
必须由我去
It has to be me.

274
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,030
不行
No.

275
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,030
Oliver 如果你在里面出事了怎么办?
Oliver, what if something happens to you in there?

276
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,160
我 Felicity或者Isabel怎么办? 
What happens to me, Felicity, or Isabel, for that matter?

277
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,430
你必须在外面行动
You have to be on the outside making the moves.

278
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,530
我进去
I'll go inside.

279
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,560
我能搞定
I've got this.

280
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,760
这毒品可真不少啊
Now that is a lot of drugs.

281
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,600
承蒙Knyazev的好意
Courtesy of Knyazev.

282
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,400
分量足够送我进地狱了
About enough weight to land me in the koshmar.

283
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,800
他们检查你时 你要穿着这个
You need to be wearing this when they process you.

284
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,930
守卫会拿走它 那就如我们所愿了
Guards will take it, but that's the point.

285
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,630
这...
This...

286
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,330
是Knyazev在监狱的线人
is Knyazev's man inside the prison.

287
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,200
一个守卫
A guard.

288
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,930
他知道Lyla被关在哪
He'll know where in the gulag Lyla is being held.

289
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,000
等到处一片混乱时
When all hell breaks loose,

290
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,860
你就要带着Lyla到汇合点与我们碰头 否则...
you need to meet us at the rendezvous point with Lyla, or...

291
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,230
否则我就永远待在俄罗斯了
Or I am a permanent Russian.

292
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,330
我有话直说...
Just thinking out loud...

293
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,860
我们就只能想出这样的方案吗?
but, are we sure this is the best plan we can come up with?

294
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,530
我知道Lyla是你的朋友 但...
I know Lyla's your friend, but...

295
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:48,260
Felicity Lyla不是我朋友
Felicity, Lyla isn't my friend.

296
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,000
她是我前妻
She was my wife.

297
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,800
你解释下
Explain that sentence.

298
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,130
Lyla和我是在阿富汗军队里认识的
Lyla and I met in the army back in Afghanistan.

299
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:59,000
但是回到美国就离婚了
But we didn't stay married long once we got stateside.

300
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,930
没有仗要打 婚姻就无法维持了
Couldn't figure out a way to stay married without a war to fight.

301
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,260
后来她加入了阿格斯
So she joined A.R.G.U.S.,

302
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,100
而我就回部队第三次服役
and I circled back for my third tour.

303
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,560
Felicity 我不能把她扔在这不管
I can't leave here without her, Felicity.

304
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,630
不能
Just can't. 

305
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,630
还有两分钟
Two minute warning.

306
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,700
祝你好运 John
Good luck, John.

307
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,230
他们抓住他了
They have him.

308
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,400
按计划行事
Clock's running.

309
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,800
进去 进去
Zhivey, zhivey.

310
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,000
快点
Hurry up.

311
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,800
东西没收
Khoroshaya Kurtka.

312
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,760
你犯了什么罪啊?
What, uh, crime fits your punishment?

313
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,030
贩毒 你呢?
Drugs. And you?

314
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,590
我做演讲啊 揭露政府腐败
I gave speech. About government corruption.

315
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,030
哦
Right.

316
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:39,390
在地狱很少见到你这样的人
It is rare to see one of your people in koshmar.

317
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,790
- 什么 美国人吗?  - 黑人
- What, American?  - Chernokozhiy.

318
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,430
呃...
Ehh... 

319
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,590
黑人在这不受欢迎
Chernokozhiy not popular here.

320
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,590
真吓人
Shocker.

321
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,360
你觉得Dig应该没事吧?
You think Dig's ok?

322
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,630
我觉得在你五分钟前问我的时候
I think he's doing the same as he was

323
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,630
他还是老样子
when you asked me five minutes ago.

324
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,290
他们来了
They're coming.

325
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,430
他们廉价卖俄式警车给我们
They sell us Russian police truck for cheap.

326
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,780
这是您需要的车
Vot mashina, kotoraya vam nuzhna.

327
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,620
一百五十万
Sto pyatisot tysyach rubley.

328
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,150
你说什么了?
What'd you say?

329
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,650
请啊
Please.

330
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,210
在俄罗斯有个古拉格
You know, in Russia, there is Gulag.

331
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,870
和这里一样恐怖
Almost as bad as this.

332
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,440
- Sara...  - 别叫出我的名字 
- Sara...  - Don't say my name.

333
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,640
如果他们知道我们互相认识 会将我们一起杀掉
If they find out we know each other, they'll kill us both.

334
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,210
我以为你被水淹了
I thought you drowned.

335
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,370
我醒来时 船已经不在了
When I came up, the boat was gone.

336
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,110
我以为你也被水淹了
And I thought you were, too.

337
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:51,170
我漂了一段时间 直到这艘船...
And I was floating out there for days when this ship...

338
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:55,140
他们发现我 然后救了我
They found me. And they saved me.

339
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,240
所以你就帮他们吗?
Is that why you're helping them?

340
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,810
我没得选了
I don't have a choice.

341
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,610
我要提醒我的朋友们
I need to warn my friends.

342
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,510
你之前说他们死了
You said they were dead.

343
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,370
他们没那么容易死的
They're not that easy to kill.

344
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,440
别动
Try not to move.

345
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,360
闻起来想吐!
It smells like puke!

346
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,000
它可以治好你的伤口
It'll heal your wounds.

347
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,530
你走吧
You have to go.

348
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,430
离开这
Get out of here.

349
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,730
去高一点的地方
Get to higher ground.

350
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,260
我不会离开你的
I'm not leaving you.

351
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,700
我不想你为了我
I will not be the reason

352
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,860
出事
something happens to you.

353
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,860
那咱们就没什么可说的了
Then we're in agreement.

354
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,130
因为我也做了自己的选择
Because I make my own choices.

355
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,860
你真是一个坚强的女人
You are a strong woman.

356
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,230
为了在乎的人 我什么事都会做
When I care about someone, there's nothing I won't do for them.

357
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,730
这是我们的另一个
Another thing...

358
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,360
共同点
We have in common.

359
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,560
这些烧伤让你的体温不断下降
The burns, they're lowering your body temperature.

360
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,830
这样
Here.

361
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,100
你晚上去哪里了?
Where you been all night?

362
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,100
- 去工作了  - 哦
- Working.  - Oh.

363
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,130
你该好好休息一下了
Well, you deserve a break.

364
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,600
呃 我最近在想
Um, actually, I've been thinking.

365
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,960
我们应该给彼此一点空间
Maybe we should take some space.

366
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,960
我们住在一起 还在一起工作
I mean, we work together and live together.

367
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,420
有点让人喘不过来气
It's kind of getting hard to breathe.

368
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,850
从什么时候开始这么想的?
Since when?

369
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,320
哦 这是不是和前几天来的那个女律师有关?
Oh, wait, does this have to with that lawyer lady dropping by?

370
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,950
不 这只和上个月
No, this has to do with the fact

371
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,750
你被抓进去两次有关
that you've been arrested twice in the last month.

372
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,020
别这样 我已经在努力不惹麻烦
Come on. I've been trying to stay out of trouble.

373
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,220
我都好几个星期没运动运动了
My body hasn't had a scratch on it in weeks.

374
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,820
除了你知道的那次
Well, I mean, excluding the ones that you put there.

375
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,820
那前天晚上怎么回事?
And the other night?

376
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,950
那是个误会
Was a misunderstanding.

377
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,850
Roy啊...
Roy...

378
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,450
这样下去不行 明白吗?
this just isn't working, ok?

379
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,820
我觉得不行
Not for me.

380
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,120
Thea 你不是认真的吧
Thea, you can't mean that.

381
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,950
我是
I do.

382
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,150
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

383
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,010
那些人...
Those men...

384
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:46,010
他们是Vory帮 这里的地头蛇
they are Vory. They are in charge.

385
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,680
最好离他们远点
It's best to stay away.

386
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,080
明白了
Got it.

387
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,040
我要找一个守卫 他叫Sergei Pavelski
Listen, I'm looking for a guard named Sergei Pavelski.

388
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,480
美国佬... 你有麻烦了
American... you are suka now.

389
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,410
确定要这样吗?
Are we seriously going to do this?

390
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,980
没错
Guess so.

391
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,680
这里严禁打架
Fighting strictly prohibited.

392
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:39,410
你好 我来见Vodki
Vodki, pozhaluysta.

393
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,180
你错过了展览
You missed the tour.

394
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,980
为什么?
What happened to you?

395
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,800
我看到一辆十分喜欢的俄罗斯汽车
I saw a Russian vehicle that I simply had to have.

396
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,200
你来俄罗斯就为了买车?
Is that why you came to Russia? Car shopping?

397
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,430
哦 我只点了一杯
Oh, I just ordered one.

398
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:57,700
另一杯是我的 再来一杯
One's for me. 

399
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,100
这里很冷
This cold room.

400
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,400
关你六个小时的禁闭
Six hours for you.

401
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,730
六个小时? 你不能把我关在这里那么久
Six hours? You can't keep me in here that long.

402
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,730
那就七个小时吧
Now seven hours.

403
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,430
你真是傻得可以...
Well, that was pretty stupid...

404
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,170
这次也一样
then again, you never really were

405
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,930
你又做了一次傻事
one of the brightest guys.

406
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:34,930
致命一枪?
Deadshot?

407
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,770
你的骨头冻透了吗?
Your spine frozen through yet?

408
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:50,140
相信我 冷不是问题
Trust me. My problem here isn't with the cold.

409
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,600
你还记恨着我开枪杀了你哥哥?
What, you still haven't forgiven me for shooting your brother?

410
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,540
你可真记仇
Man, you really hold a grudge.

411
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,800
我知道你怎么找来的
I know why you're here.

412
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,670
因为那个阿格斯的女孩
That girl. From A.R.G.U.S.

413
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,470
Lyla找到的不是线索
Lyla didn't find a lead on you.

414
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:10,000
而直接找到了你
She found you.

415
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,900
你们真的以为
Does everyone really think

416
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,700
- Felicity和我...  - 不
- that Felicity and I are...  - No.

417
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,700
只有Queen实业的员工才那么想
Just everyone who works at Queen Consolidated.

418
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,840
我们是纯洁的友谊关系
She's just a friend.

419
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,500
你看起来可不像和女性只做朋友
You don't seem like the kind of man who has female friends.

420
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,200
我能问你个私人问题吗?
Can I ask you a personal question?

421
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,230
既然我喝了点伏特加 那你就问吧
With some vodka in me, I just might answer.

422
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,060
为什么拯救我的家族企业
Why does saving my family's company

423
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,930
对你来说那么重要?
mean so much to you?

424
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,530
不管雪莉·桑德伯格说得多好听...
Despite what Sheryl Sandberg might say...

425
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,530
{\an8}Facebook的副总裁

426
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,660
女人想在商界站住脚仍然不那么容易
it still isn't that easy to make it as a woman in business.

427
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,860
我... 牺牲了很多
I've... given up a lot.

428
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,530
所以我如果不力求完美
Which means if I don't succeed at everything,

429
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,830
那些牺牲还有什么用?
then what was the point?

430
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,490
嗯
Hmm.

431
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,060
我能问你一个私人问题吗?
May I ask you a personal question?

432
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,260
你可以试试
Others have tried and failed.

433
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,960
为什么你要绞尽脑汁让我相信你是个大笨蛋?
Why do you try so hard to make me think that you're a lazy idiot?

434
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,990
我知道你不是
I know you're not.

435
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:05,690
你的那些小花招唬不了我
Underneath that swagger, I see you pretty clearly.

436
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,830
是吗?
Really?

437
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,890
那你说我是什么样的人?
And what do you see?

438
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:12,090
你很聪明
You're intelligent.

439
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,460
有上进心
Driven.

440
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,030
还很寂寞
And lonely.

441
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,030
你怎么知道的?
How do you see that?

442
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,760
因为我照镜子的时候 看到的也是这样的面容
Because it's what I see when I look in the mirror.

443
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,920
时间紧迫
We don't have much time.

444
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,120
好了
There you go.

445
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,950
我们走
Let's go, let's go.

446
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,650
很高兴见到你 John
Nice seeing you, John.

447
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,940
还需要什么吗?

448
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,290
我觉得还是不要再喝了吧?

449
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,750
你会说俄语
You speak Russian.

450
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,260
只在朋友面前

451
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,050
九岁以前我生活在莫斯科
I was raised in Moscow until I was nine.

452
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,080
然后我被收养了 他们带我来到了美国
And then adopted by a family that took me to America.

453
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,680
过了很长时间我才改掉口音
Took me years to get rid of my accent.

454
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:07,020
说话像娜塔莎那样 在学校里可交不到朋友
It isn't easy making friends in grade school when you sound like Natasha.

455
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:15,870
看来你已经寂寞很久了

456
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,120
想知道多久吗?

457
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,340
我... 我等下还有事情
I... don't have a lot of time.

458
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,740
很快的
I'll be quick.

459
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,770
还有五分钟 我们快点
Five minutes. Must hurry.

460
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,870
提醒我事情办完了别忘给你送一大包烟
Remind me to get you a pack of cigarettes when this is all over.

461
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,870
我不抽烟
I don't smoke.

462
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,360
你才不会扔下我自己走了 是吧?
You weren't going to leave without me, were you?

463
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,970
我要杀了你!
I should kill you right now!

464
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,370
不会的
You won't.

465
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,570
- 为什么?  - 因为
- Why?  - Because

466
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,770
只有我知道你的小女朋友在哪
I'm the only one who knows where your little girlfriend is.

467
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,370
你不傻
You're not stupid.

468
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,940
你不会不给自己留好退路的
You wouldn't put yourself in here without an exit strategy.

469
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,640
我带你去找她...
I take you to the girl...

470
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,870
你带我出去
you take me out.

471
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,070
Isabel 我得走了
Isabel, I have to go.

472
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,270
不好意思
Sorry.

473
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:17,170
你觉得我还用你吻别?
Do I strike you as someone who needs to cuddle?

474
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,440
嗨
Hi.

475
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,470
嗨
Hi.

476
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,070
时间到了 准备好了吗?
It's time. Ready?

477
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,510
嗯 我...
Yeah, I...

478
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,150
你可以让她今天晚上放假 对吧?
I think she can take the night off. Don't you?

479
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,346
- 哦  - Felicity...
- Ohh.  - Felicity...

480
00:29:34,404 --> 00:29:39,580
哦... 在俄罗斯发生的事情就留在俄罗斯吧
It... what happens in Russia stays in Russia.

481
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,980
虽然这么说也没什么意义
Even when it makes no sense whatsoever.

482
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,670
我猜 你想留着它吧
Guessin', uh, you want to hold on to that.

483
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,870
这边走
This way.

484
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,380
你是怎么想的?
What were you thinking?

485
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,780
什么?
What?

486
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,250
俄罗斯有六千四百万成年女性
Over 64 million women over the age of consent

487
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,250
而你和她睡了
in Russia and you sleep with her.

488
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,850
不是说"在俄罗斯发生的事情
So we're not doing the "what happens in Russia

489
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,180
- 就留在俄罗斯"吗?  - 我们还没离开俄罗斯
- Stays in Russia?"  - We're still in Russia.

490
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:27,180
在这个国家 只要有钱没什么办不到
There is nothing money cannot buy in this country.

491
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,980
Diggle马上就要把Lyla带出来了
Diggle should be heading out Lyla in two minutes.

492
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,050
越狱可不是看起来那么容易
Well, breaking out of prison is harder than it looks.

493
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,650
你们应该知道
You of all people should know that.

494
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,890
别说话
Stay quiet.

495
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,320
跟我走
Follow me.

496
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,310
你要记着回来救我们...
You'll remember the rest of us...

497
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,350
好吗?
Yes?

498
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,050
我答应你
I promise.

499
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,950
一定会回来的
I'll come back.

500
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,980
走吧
Come on.

501
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,210
我们要游出去吗?
Are we making a swim for it?

502
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:26,660
不 我们一下水就会被乱枪打死
No. They'd shoot us the second we hit the water.

503
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,660
你说过你朋友们有一个
You said your friends, they have one

504
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,660
船上的无线电话 是吧?
of the radios from the ship, right?

505
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,860
嗯
Yeah.

506
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,760
你看起来很专业
You look like you know what you're doing there.

507
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,160
过去这几年我学到了不少本领
In the past year, I've learned a lot of things I never expected to.

508
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,920
我也是
You and me both.

509
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,660
只有听到你的声音 他们才会回答
They won't respond unless they hear your voice.

510
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,490
Shado啊
Shado.

511
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:01,190
你能听到我吗?
Ni neng ting dao wo ma?

512
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,260
嘿 Slade
Slade.

513
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,390
能听到吗?
Can you hear me?

514
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,420
谢天谢地 你还活着
Thank god you're alive.

515
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,290
没错 我在货船...
Yeah, I'm on the freighter...

516
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,860
Sara 你在做什么?
Sara, what are you doing?

517
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,690
只有两个人
There's only two of them.

518
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,460
他们没有离开迫击炮袭击的地方
They haven't moved from the location of the mortar attack.

519
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,120
这到底是什么情况?
What the hell is going on here?

520
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,590
你刚刚确认了你朋友还活着
You just confirmed that your friends are alive.

521
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,120
这就意味着他们依旧是威胁
Which means they're still a threat.

522
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,060
所以我们还是得杀了他们
You know, until we kill them.

523
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,790
如果我说她就在里面
If I say she's in there,

524
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,320
你为什么不杀了我?
what's keeping you from shooting me?

525
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,630
为了荣誉
Honor.

526
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,730
你也该试试
You should try it some time.

527
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,560
嘿 Lyla!
Lyla!

528
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,260
是Johnny?
Johnny?

529
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,690
准备好回家了吗?
Ready to go home?

530
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,190
你来救我了
You came for me.

531
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,250
无论何时 我都会救你
I always have. Always will.

532
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,590
"致命一枪"在这里
Deadshot's here.

533
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,750
就在监狱里
In the prison.

534
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,150
我知道
I know.

535
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,620
你有什么撤离计划?
What's your extraction plan?

536
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,250
要看情况 几点了?
Depends. What time is it?

537
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,350
我穿着怎么样?

538
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:45,200
我们走 快 快!
Let's go, go, go, move, move, move!

539
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,300
这边走
This way.

540
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,860
好了
Got it.

541
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,430
我把电话线断了 看守就没法叫增援了
I shut down the phones. The guards can't call for help.

542
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,060
如果你的朋友和救的女人还没来
Your friend and that woman are not here by now,

543
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,730
那就是逃不出来了
they will not be here at all.

544
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,860
好多了
Much better.

545
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,760
全都趴到地上

546
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:35,728
Oliver 蹲下!
Oliver, get down!

547
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,160
跟我来! 快!
Follow me! Move!

548
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,470
安全了
We're clear.

549
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,770
停车
Stop the truck.

550
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,310
下车
Get out.

551
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,110
下车!
Get out!

552
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:17,640
往前走
Move.

553
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:39,670
这就是重视荣誉的坏处 John
That's the thing about honor, John.

554
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,410
你没法自己控制
You can't turn it on and off.

555
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,510
我只是好奇
I'm just curious.

556
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,710
你觉得你哥哥是怎么死的?
How is it you think your brother ended up dead?

557
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,240
你开枪要杀Andy正在保护的客户
You shot a client that Andy was protecting,

558
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,870
结果失手了
and you missed.

559
00:35:56,870 --> 00:36:01,010
我没失手
I don't miss.

560
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,210
你哥哥本来就是我的目标
Your brother was the contract.

561
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,870
谁会想杀Andy?
Who would want to kill Andy?

562
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,440
我不知道具体名字 只有个代号
I don't know the names, just an alias.

563
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,670
叫Hive
Hive.

564
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,580
好好想想 John
Food for thought, John.

565
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,320
好好想想
Food for thought.

566
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:55,430
我们要不要谈谈昨晚的事?
Are we going to discuss what happened last night?

567
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,390
为什么要谈?
Why would we?

568
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,390
没什么理由
No reason.

569
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,730
明天办公室见
I'll see you in the office tomorrow.

570
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,170
谢谢
Thank you.

571
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,340
你帮了我
You had my back.

572
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,540
现在你也知道有人帮的感觉了
And now you know what it feels like.

573
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:33,600
你... 你来这里做什么?
Wh... what are you... What are you doing here?

574
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,470
问得好
Good question.

575
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,670
我接到过很多监狱打来的电话
I've gotten a lot of calls from prison,

576
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,130
但从来没接过女友妈妈打来的
but never from my girlfriend's mother.

577
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,160
我突然想到 我从来都没机会
It occurred to me that I've never been given

578
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,890
见见你的这位男朋友
the opportunity to meet the man in your life.

579
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,960
我不知道她告没告诉你
I don't know if she told you,

580
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,690
但你女儿把我甩了
but your daughter kind of dumped me.

581
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,130
那你应该知道 她这么做是为了我
And what you should know is that she did it for me.

582
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:53,190
Jean跟我说她去见过你了
Jean told me she came to see you.

583
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,990
我跟她说她不该这么做
I told her she shouldn't have.

584
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,690
你为什么不跟我实话实说?
Why didn't you just tell me the truth?

585
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,200
如果我们接着交往...
Us being together...

586
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,300
对她的审判不利
it can hurt her case.

587
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,370
Thea 听着...
Thea...

588
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:08,540
你的私生活不会成为左右我审判结果的关键因素
your social life is not going to be the determining factor in my trial.

589
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,540
宝贝 你在这一年里经历的事情
Sweetheart, what you've had to endure this last year

590
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,100
比别人两辈子经历的都多
is more than most people go through in two lifetimes.

591
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,270
但你不仅撑过来了 还活得很好
But you've not only survived, you've flourished.

592
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,440
我想很大一部分得归功于Roy
I think a lot of that has to do with Roy.

593
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,200
作为你妈妈 我不允许你不见他
So, as your mother, I forbid you not to see him.

594
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,440
谢谢
Thank you.

595
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,240
我得承认
I have to admit,

596
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,280
我没预料到我的俄国之旅会这样结束
this is not how I anticipated my trip to Russia ending.

597
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,810
我们能活着逃出来可真是幸运
I just feel lucky we made it out of there alive.

598
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,480
谢谢
Thank you.

599
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,540
并不只是谢你救了我
Not just for coming for me.

600
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,240
而是谢你为我做了牺牲
For doing what you had to once you did.

601
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,100
你是说和"致命一枪"合作的事
You mean working with Deadshot.

602
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,600
要知道 我和Carly分手就是因为我做不到爱着她
You know, me and Carly broke up because I couldn't love her

603
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,140
还恨着"致命一枪"
and hate him at the same time.

604
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,270
我很荣幸能成为这例外
I'm honored to be the exception.

605
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,770
Lyla 你永远是例外
Lyla, you're always the exception.

606
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,850
我8点要去阿格斯做任务报告
I have a debrief with A.R.G.U.S. at 0800.

607
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,180
别去了 让Waller操心去
No, no, let Waller stew.

608
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,580
留下来吃早饭
Stay for breakfast.

609
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,310
要是你给我做蓝莓煎饼 我就考虑留下来
Throw in your blueberry pancakes and you may be able to convince me.

610
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:03,310
你能把这个送到Isabel的办公室吗?
Can you deliver this to Isabel's office, please?

611
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,810
为什么是她?
Why her?

612
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:09,580
我是说 除了她...
I mean, besides the...

613
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,410
有长腿模特身材这理由之外
obvious leggy model reason.

614
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,710
就这么发生了
It just kind of happened.

615
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,550
这并不意味着什么
It didn't mean anything.

616
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,280
嘿
Hey.

617
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,980
因为我的这种生活...
Because of the life that I lead...

618
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,980
我只是觉得 最好还是不要...
I just think that it's better to not...

619
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,580
和我真正关心的人在一起会比较好
be with someone that I could really care about.

620
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,220
好吧 但我觉得...
Well, I think...

621
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,990
你应该找个比她更好的
I think you deserve better than her.

622
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:05,380
找到他们的位置了
We have their location.

623
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,350
这个现在对我们没用了
This one's no longer of use to us.

624
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,580
我们来看看你从脑袋里...
Let's see how good you are...

625
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,410
拔子弹的技术有多好
at removing a bullet from your head.

626
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:14,780
等等!
Wait!

627
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,450
他可能还有用
He could still be useful.

628
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:21,590
她说得对
She's right.

629
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,890
等我们杀了他的朋友
Once we get rid of his friends,

630
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,620
还需要他带我们去坟墓
we'll need him to lead us to the graves.

631
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,290
我有时候很疑惑 到底谁来发号施令
Sometimes I wonder who gives the orders here.

632
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,020
是你...
You...

633
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,260
还是这个金发小妞
or your little bouzin.

634
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:53,220
你要回岛上去
You're going back to the island.

635
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,820
叫Oliver对吧
Oliver.
