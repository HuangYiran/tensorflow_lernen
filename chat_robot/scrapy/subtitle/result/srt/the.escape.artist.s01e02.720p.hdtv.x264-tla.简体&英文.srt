00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:50,080
{\pos(110,242)}shad2前情回顾

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,180
我不是特别喜欢人
I don't like people very much.

3
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,190
我就不是那么和善的一个人
I'm just not a very nice person.

4
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,580
什么世道
The world is broken.

5
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,060
你不该在睡觉前看恐怖电影的
You shouldn't watch scary movies so close to bedtime.

6
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,750
可能福伊尔先生并不招人喜欢
We may dislike Mr Foyle.

7
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,860
但为他辩护并不需要喜欢他
We do not have to like him to defend him.

8
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,590
我才不是为了曝光度  玛吉
I don't do things for exposure, Maggie

9
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,890
-那为什么接  -因为每个人都有权申辩
- Why do you do it? - Because everyone deserves a defence.

10
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,870
考虑到本案已经产生的新闻
Given the press this case has already generated,

11
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,020
福伊尔先生也得不到公正的审判
Mr Foyle cannot be given a fair trial.

12
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,150
我别无选择  只能解散陪审团并释放被告
I have no alternative but to discharge the jury and release the defendant.

13
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,850
威尔  好样的  谢谢你  我的朋友
Will, good man. Thank you, my friend.

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,250
不客气  保重
Pleasure. Take care.

15
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,300
我们在那儿等你好了  不过你抓紧点
Why don't we see you up there? But hurry up,

16
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,960
我有东西要给你看
I want to show you something.

17
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,880
凯特  杰米
Kate?! Jamie!

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,020
-爸爸  -杰米
- Dad! - Jamie!

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,640
-你替他辩护  -每个人都有权申辩
- You're defending him. - Everyone deserves a defence.

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,050
没错  玛吉
That's right, Maggie.

21
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,320
没错
That's right.

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,010
妈妈  妈妈  爸爸
Mum! Mum! Dad!

23
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:50,640
救救我  爸爸  爸爸  不  爸爸
Help! Dad! Dad! No! DAD!!

24
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,420
-爸爸  不要  -好了  没事了
- Dad!! No! - All right... All right...

25
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,430
好了  没事了  乖  没事了
It's all right, all right. It's OK.

26
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,870
没事了  没事了
It's all right, it's all right.

27
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,480
哈里斯  特雷弗·哈里斯  人呢
Harris? Trevor Harris. Anyone?

28
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,570
来研究威尔案子的控词
Plea and case management on Will's case.

29
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,670
审判被提前了  我们要改日程
Whole thing just got moved up. We'll have to change the dates.

30
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,660
-好  -不  一点都不好
- Good. - No, not good at all.

31
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,420
该死的时间越多越好
We need all the bloody time we can get.

32
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,640
我们完全确定了  威尔的儿子什么也没看见
We're absolutely sure Will's son didn't see anything.

33
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,680
我是说  如果我们有两个证人的证词
It's just if we had two witness statements. I mean,

34
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,820
就不用过于依靠DNA证据了
it would take the weight off the DNA.

35
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,670
-要是有DNA的话  -现在就这样
- If it comes in. - This is where we are.

36
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,770
我们手上证据就这么多
This is what we've have to work with.

37
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,230
血液  目击证人和不在场证明
Blood, ID, alibi.

38
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,740
如果老天帮忙  再加上点运气
And God help us, a following wind.

39
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,770
不  你要听我解释
No, that's what I'm trying to explain to you.

40
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,260
听着  我妻子不用须后水
Look, my wife does not wear aftershave

41
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,620
而我对彼得兔收藏品一丁点兴趣都没有
and I am not the least bit interested in Peter Rabbit collectibles.

42
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,660
所以如果要我帮你搞清楚来龙去脉
So if you want me to join the dots for you,

43
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,220
那肯定是有人盗窃了我妻子的身份
someone has stolen my wife's identity.

44
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,120
好吧  听着  那是不可能的
Yeah, well, that's not going to happen, is it?

45
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,640
你没法跟她说话
Well, you can't talk to her.

46
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,990
是  我已经去认过了
Yeah, I already identified her.

47
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,870
我走进太平间  还亲了她的脸颊
I walked into the mortuary and kissed her face.

48
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,430
我吓着你了吧
Did I scare you?

49
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,270
对不起
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,730
我也希望事情不是这样  可惜事与愿违
I wish things could be different, but they're not.

51
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,130
听着  如果你有什么话想跟我说
Look, if you ever want to tell me something, anything,

52
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,730
说说那天的事情  就来找我  好吗
about what happened, I'll be here. OK?

53
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,660
直接说出来就行
Just come right out and say it.

54
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,810
我会听着的
I'll be listening.

55
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,980
好吗
Yeah?

56
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,680
下雨时  小动物会怎么样
When it rains, what happens to all the little animals?

57
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,860
-你觉得它们会被淹死吗  -福伊尔先生
- Do they drown, do you think? - Mr Foyle.

58
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,460
我曾经很喜欢下雨天
I used to love it when it rained.

59
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,220
但现在一下雨我就很伤心
But now I get so sad when it's wet out

60
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,790
因为我会想到那些小东西
cos all I can think about is all these little bodies

61
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,930
在泥水中挣扎呻吟
clawing and squeaking at the earth and the mud

62
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,730
在黑暗中淹死
and the water and drowning in the dark.

63
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,470
植物喝水可真没良心  我知道它们必须喝水
It's a shame the plants have to drink. I know they do,

64
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,350
但依然是没良心  一下雨我就很难过
but it's a shame. I get so sad when it's wet.

65
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,300
尤其是经过了这个夏天
Especially after the summer we had.

66
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,300
福伊尔先生  我们要确保你搞清楚了辩词
Mr Foyle, we need to be sure that you understand your plea.

67
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,620
有证据证明我当晚在那间小屋吗
Is there any evidence that puts me at the cottage?

68
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,530
有一个目击证人看到了你  因而才指控你
You were charged on the basis of one eye witness identification.

69
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,530
一个
One.

70
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,920
对  一个  他儿子还什么都没说
Yes, one. The son hasn't made a statement.

71
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,710
-暂时没说  -暂时
- Not yet. - Yet.

72
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,970
你觉得他看到什么了吗
You think he saw something?

73
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,990
只有一个目击证人  这就是我们要面对的
There's only one witness. That's what we're dealing with.

74
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,580
那是什么
What's that?

75
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,330
茶
Tea.

76
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,720
-哪种茶  -我这种
- What kind of tea? - My tea.

77
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,750
我们还要谈谈你的不在场证明  莫里斯小姐
We also need to talk about your alibi, Ms Morris.

78
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,150
我们在辩词中详细陈述了
We go into considerable detail in our defence statement

79
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,340
当晚我们的行踪
about our whereabouts that evening

80
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,510
我们相信莫里斯女士会支持这一证词
and we are confident Ms. Morris will support this.

81
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,080
那为什么还要谈这个
Then why do we need to discuss this?

82
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,070
就是要谈
Because we need to discuss this.

83
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,230
伯顿先生是本案的唯一目击者
Mr Burton is the only witness in this whole case.

84
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,650
所以他不能代表自己
So he can't act for himself.

85
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,110
-你很懂刑事诉讼程序  -我学过法律
- You're well-versed in criminal procedure. - I did a law course.

86
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,970
-是吗  在哪儿学的  -剑桥
- Oh, really, where was that? - Cambridge.

87
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,710
安格利亚理工大学
Anglia Polytechnic University.

88
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:59,070
我们说不定在银街擦肩过呢
We probably cycled past one another on Silver Street.

89
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,770
-世界很小  -确实
- It's a small world. - Indeed.

90
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,450
你说得对  伯顿先生不能以律师身份出庭
Yes, you're right, Mr Burton will not be in court.

91
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,950
他是目击者  无论如何都不能代表检方
As he's a witness, he cannot act for the Crown in any way.

92
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,160
话说回来  他老是压在你头上
It's just that, you know, he kept beating you, is all.

93
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,320
他不能出庭
He's not allowed to be there.

94
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,870
所以他只能看着
So he just has to watch.

95
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,390
我认为是的
I suppose so.

96
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,580
而且  当时很黑
Besides, it was very dark.

97
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,310
确实
Indeed.

98
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,530
真为那些动物感到遗憾  对吧
Shame about all those animals, isn't it?

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,610
你良心不安
You have qualms.

100
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,490
你说什么
I beg your pardon?

101
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,230
这是你辩护的第一宗大案  你熬夜工作
It's your first big defence. You're working late.

102
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,490
-却良心不安  -他的妻子去世了
- You have qualms. - He lost his wife.

103
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,970
如果反过来  他一定不会犹豫
If the tables were turned, he would not hesitate.

104
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,570
就是这样
This is how it works.

105
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,320
我只知道  如果我是威尔...
I just know that if I was Will...

106
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,000
但你不是他  对吧
But you're not him, are you?

107
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,440
暂时还成不了
Not yet, anyway.

108
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,380
怎么样  我可能只能待五分钟
All right? I've probably only got about five minutes.

109
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,820
-今早真是忙疯了  -情况如何
- It's a bit of a crazy morning. - How's it looking?

110
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,500
我每次经过会议室
Every time I pass the conference room

111
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,110
都有一大队人在敲门
there's a huge queue of people knocking on the door.

112
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,980
大家都想帮忙  伙计
Everyone wants to help, mate.

113
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,600
-谁是首席律师  -梅菲尔德先生
- Who's leading? - Mr Mayfield.

114
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,860
哈里斯先生是他的助理律师  其他人都很忙
Mr Harris is his junior. Everyone else was busy.

115
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,020
知道他们要靠哪些证据打官司吗
Any idea what they are running with?

116
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,080
不想说的话就算了
You don't have to say a thing if you don't want to.

117
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,110
取证人员在花园里找到了一个12码的鞋印
Forensics found a size 12 boot print in the garden.

118
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,130
但福伊尔的鞋子都是9码  跟鞋印不匹配
But all Foyle's footwear is a size nine. No match on the tread.

119
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,190
就我所知  他们都还在等鉴证报告
So as far as I can tell they are all waiting for the forensics' report.

120
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,800
还有案发现场的血迹  以及你的指认
The crime scene blood. Plus, your ID of him.

121
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,020
-还有呢  -没了
- And? - I think that's it.

122
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,880
他的不在场证明呢
What about his alibi?

123
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,430
他的邻居说跟他一起吃晚餐
His neighbour said she had dinner with him.

124
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,390
他们还在寻找可能的突破点
They are looking into possible angles.

125
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,410
-他的邻居叫什么  -艾琳·莫里斯
- What's this woman's name? - Eileen Morris.

126
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,000
再说一次
Say that again.

127
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,870
艾琳·莫里斯  对吧
Eileen Morris, right?

128
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,550
查了一下旧档案
Did a little rooting around in the old case file.

129
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,000
只能查到这些
This is all I could come up with.

130
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,450
你还记得吗  他喜欢养鸟
He's a bird fancier, if you remember.

131
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,090
看到是谁把奖杯颁给他的吗
See who's presenting him with that trophy?

132
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,120
教区委员会活动组委会主席艾琳·莫里斯
"Parish Council Events Committee Co-Chair Eileen Morris".

133
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,480
恐怕只有这些给你了
That's all I've got for you I'm afraid.

134
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,860
不止这些  我肯定还在别处见过她的名字
There was something else. I'm sure I've seen her name somewhere else.

135
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,650
谢了  鲍勃
Thanks, Bob.

136
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,220
不客气
You're welcome.

137
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,000
自助仓储

138
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,000
福伊尔的不在场证明可能没他们想的那么确凿
Foyle's alibi might not be as solid as they're making out.

139
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,320
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

140
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,670
真不公平
Doesn't seem fair.

141
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,520
这栋楼里最棒的法律头脑
Biggest legal brain in the building,

142
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,230
却不能跟他们谈论自己的案子
can't even talk to them about your own bloody case.

143
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,990
是啊
No, I can't.

144
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,820
不能直接谈
Not directly.

145
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,070
现在不是我给他辩护了  对吧
It's not like I am defending him anymore, is it?

146
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,390
你知道桑德拉·马林斯一案的资料在哪儿吗
Do you have any idea where the Sandra Mullins case files are?

147
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,970
知道  大盒子  我上周在研究那些东西呢
I think so, yeah. Big box. Stubbed my toe on it last week.

148
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,860
是不是就在我办公室附近
Do you think it might be near my office?

149
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,280
可能吧
I think it could be.

150
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,910
{\pos(190,58)}shad2前四十名排行榜

151
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,910
{\pos(250,138)}shad2第一名

152
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,100
哈里斯先生
Mr Harris!

153
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,520
你看过科林伍德纵火案的案情摘要吗
Did you see the Collingwood arson brief?

154
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,250
保密的那份
The private one?

155
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,540
看了  就在它闪电般飞向
Yes, I caught sight of it as it flew past me

156
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,350
某皇家律师的途中瞟了一眼
at high velocity on its way to one of the silks.

157
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,820
你怎么不从塔拉的本子里抽一张出来
Why don't you take a page out of Tara's book?

158
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,100
我已经够抬不起头了  谢了
My nose is brown enough already, thank you.

159
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,860
她做了必须做的事  你时不时的也可以做啊
She does what she has to. Why don't you do that now and then?

160
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,450
那我就跟塔拉一样了  不是吗
Because then I'd be like Tara, wouldn't I?

161
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,070
-你去哪儿  -福伊尔的辩词要出来了
- You heading over? - Foyle's making his plea.

162
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,950
这么说已经开始了  情况如何  你怎么看
Right. So it's started. How's it looking, do you think?

163
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,250
没有DNA  单个目击证人  受压指认
No sign of DNA at the scene, single eyewitness, recognition under duress.

164
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,670
回旋余地不是很大
Not a lot of wiggle room.

165
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,630
威尔的儿子在场  但如果他有看到什么
Will's boy was there... But if he had seen something, well,

166
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,560
早该说出来了  不是吗
he would have said something, wouldn't he?

167
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,610
哈里斯先生
Mr Harris.

168
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,080
-别说  -不  我考虑过了
- Don't. - No, I've been thinking.

169
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,290
打住  我认真的
Well, stop. I mean it.

170
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,240
该走了
Time to go.

171
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,810
杰米你好  欢迎回来
Hi, Jamie, welcome back.

172
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,490
-你还好吧  -再见
- Are you OK? - See you.

173
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,010
-你没事吧  -没事
- Are you all right? - All right.

174
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,270
利亚姆·迈克尔·福伊尔  你被控告
Liam Michael Foyle, you are charged on this indictment

175
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,690
谋杀一人  你的辩词
with one count of murder. How do you plead?

176
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,060
无罪
Not guilty.

177
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,510
法官阁下  鉴于证据缺乏
My Lord, given the lack of evidence

178
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,460
我方提出保释申请
at this time we are serving a bail application notice.

179
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,300
我之前毫不知情  法官阁下
First I've heard of it, my lord. 

180
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,640
我们递交很及时
It was served in good time.

181
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,900
-我以为给你了  -我读过
- I thought I gave it to you. - Well, I read it.

182
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,050
准予保释  按相应程序制约
Bail granted, subject to conditions as per application.

183
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,900
谢谢法官阁下  我今早咨询过排期员
Thank you, my lord. Also, I've spoken to the List Officer this morning,

184
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,870
被告知31号起有一周的时间可以开庭
who's informed me a slot is available for a week-long case on the 31st.

185
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,820
-很好  -等等  距现在只有几周时间
- Very well. - Wait. That's only a few weeks away.

186
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,940
-我们几乎没有时间准备证据  -什么证据
- It hardly gives us any time to prepare the evidence? - What evidence?

187
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,320
福伊尔先生  你可以离开被告席了
Mr Foyle, you may leave the dock.

188
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,500
全体起立
All rise.

189
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,820
-还没谢过你  -不客气
- Never said thank you. - Oh, you're welcome.

190
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,220
-回头见  -好
- See you soon. - Yes.

191
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,870
你惹大麻烦了
You're in a lot of trouble.

192
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,670
我给你做了酥皮点心
I made you some crumble.

193
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,500
我一定是忘了关笼子
I must have left my cage open

194
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,560
因为有只小小鸟刚给我办了保释
cos a little birdie just bailed me out.

195
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,580
你不该去的  艾琳  真的
You shouldn't have done that, Eileen, really.

196
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,210
只花了半个小时
It takes half an hour.

197
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,380
我说的不是这个
That's not what I am talking about.

198
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,690
拜托  我很乐意出钱
Oh, please. I was happy to pay.

199
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,940
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

200
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,360
苹果的还是李子的  
Apple or plum?

201
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,580
大黄的  就在教区委员会的冰箱里等着你
Rhubarb. It's in the fridge at the parish council, waiting for you.

202
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,120
它们不会等很久的  我保证
It won't be there too long, I promise.

203
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,620
-要做的事情还很多  -当然了
- Lots to be getting on with. - Oh, sure.

204
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,040
-我每天都喂食  照你交代的  -很好
- I fed them every day, just like you asked. - Good.

205
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,560
大家都饿了
Everybody's hungry.

206
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,050
好  我们再过一遍吧
All right, let's run it again, shall we?

207
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,330
验尸报告显示凶手动刀前勒过凯特
Post mortem indicates Kate was strangled before he cut into her.

208
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,560
-刀从...  -脚印有什么新发现
- The knife entered... - Any update onthe footprints?

209
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,800
现场到处都是  尺码全都不对
Locus is littered with them, all the wrong size.

210
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,990
然后刀刃划过气管
After that, the blade passed through the trachea...

211
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,680
气管是不能"划过"的
You don't "pass through" The trachea.

212
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,620
是个锯的动作  力气非常大
It's a sawing motion. The core strength of a fast bowler.

213
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,620
-加文  -血溅得到处都是
- Gavin! - One hell of a blood spatter.

214
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,750
威尔来了
Will's here.

215
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,910
-到底是怎么搞的  -跟往常一样啊
- How the hell did this happen? - The usual way.

216
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,560
怎么  他从正门进来的
What? He came in the front door.

217
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,220
我们看他妻子照片的时候把那该死的前门关了
Well, go and close the bloodly front when we view the pictures of his wife.

218
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,230
你要出现也该提前打个电话
You need to call ahead if you're going to just turn up.

219
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,750
我也在这里工作
I work here, too.

220
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,940
大家都支持你
Everyone's behind you on this,

221
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,490
但是如果你被发现试图干涉此案
but you get caught trying to influence the case,

222
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,070
会危及到整个事务所
you're jeopardising the entire enterprise.

223
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,800
你是唯一的目击证人  所以别插手了
You're the only witness. So hands off.

224
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,270
规则不一定要遵守
Protocol doesn't just need to be followed,

225
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,180
但是表面上一定要遵守
it needs to be seen to be followed.

226
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,190
我知道  我大学读的法律
I know. I actually studied law in the university.

227
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,640
说句大实话
To be quite frank,

228
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,670
你连自己的办公室都别去那是最好
we'd prefer it if you didn't even come into chambers.

229
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,440
如果再在家里憋上一天
If I have to stay home one more day,

230
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,180
我发誓我就要杀人了
I swear I'm going to kill somebody.

231
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,400
我需要工作  拜托了
I need to work. Please?

232
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,550
是今天  对吧  出辩词
It was today, wasn't it? The plea?

233
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,760
他们没给你打电话吗  应该给你打电话的
They didn't call you? They should've called you.

234
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,190
-说呀  -无罪
- Talk to me! - Not guilty.

235
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,520
押在什么地方  斯科拉布斯
Remanded where? The Scrubs?

236
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,590
其实他被保释了
Actually he got bail.

237
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,900
已拘留过  弃保潜逃的可能性低
Already in custody, low risk of absconding.

238
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,730
是有条件保释 
It's conditional.

239
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,540
-什么时候  -今天上午
- When was this? - This morning. Ohh!

240
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,920
你真的应该通过正当途径来做这些事
You should really be doing this through the... proper channels.

241
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,630
-借我们口香糖  -是啊
- Lend us chewing gum. - Yeah.

242
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,910
-听说福斯特博士的事了吗  -听说了
- Did you hear about Dr Foster? - Yeah.

243
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,800
我是威尔·伯顿  杰米的爸爸
It's Will Burton, Jamie's Dad.

244
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,910
告诉他我去接他好吗
Tell him I'll be there to pick him up?

245
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,810
他跟阿尔菲走了  说要一起去搭巴士
"He left with Alfie, they said they were getting the bus together."

246
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,860
好吧  多谢
All right, thanks.

247
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,170
-康纳  你见到杰米吗  -没有
- Connor, have you seen Jamie? - No.

248
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,650
-好的  -没看到
- OK. - No, I haven't.

249
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,960
妈  有消息吗  他在吗
Mum, anything? Is he here?

250
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,620
他们说他已经走了
They said he'd already left.

251
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,300
你为什么不打电话给我
Why didn't you call me?!

252
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,900
帕特  杰米在吗
Hi, Pat, is Jamie there?

253
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,080
我想问他有和阿尔菲一起吗
I was wondering if he's with Alfie?

254
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,710
问过图书馆了吗
Have you tried the library?

255
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,900
-新手机吗  -最近刚买的
- Is that a new phone? - I got it recently.

256
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,290
听听看
Listen to this.

257
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:27,030
昨天在电台里听过
Yeah, I heard it on the radio yesterday.

258
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,380
-我要下车了  明天学校见  -再见
- Ah, it's my stop. See you at school. - See you.

259
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,810
他有跟阿尔菲一起下车吗
Did he get off at Alfie's stop?

260
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,540
好  好的
OK. All right.

261
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,580
没事  别着急  谢谢
No, don't worry. Don't worry. Thanks.

262
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,310
好了  我要报警了
That's it, I'm calling the police.

263
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,690
杰米
Jamie?!

264
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,210
-你到底去哪儿了  -我们去了商店
- Where the hell have you been?! - We went to the shop.

265
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,570
-有和陌生人说话吗  -没有
- Did you talk to anyone? - No.

266
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,720
你向我保证
You're going to promise me

267
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,660
以后不跟陌生人说话  好吗
you'll not talk to anyone you don't know, all right?

268
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,290
不管是大街上还是游乐场  哪里都不行
Not on the street, not the playground, not anywhere.

269
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,780
以后我接你回家
I'm picking you up from school from now on.

270
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,190
好吗  每天我都来接你
OK? Every single day. OK?

271
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,700
-爸爸  -让我抱一会儿
- Dad! - Just give me a minute.

272
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,350
莫斯科的海狮在这个季节可饥渴了
The sea lions of Moscow are horny this time of the year.

273
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,010
-去你的  -放轻松嘛
- Up yours. - Oh, relax.

274
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,630
-走吧  我们到楼上去  -为什么
- Right, come on. Let's go upstairs. - Why?

275
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,980
走就是了  伙计
Come on, boy.

276
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,090
来吧
Come on.

277
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,280
就不能在公园见面吗
Couldn't meet in a park?

278
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,080
人多的地方最隐蔽
It's the best place to hide, in a crowd.

279
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,710
-众目睽睽之下  -狗屁
- In plain sight. - Plain stupid.

280
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,660
不就是两个男人聊聊天嘛
We're just chatting. Two blokes having a chat.

281
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,300
你想怎样
What do you want to do?

282
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,760
来聊聊足球吧
Let's talk football.

283
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,830
我曾经  现在也还爱着我们那支球队
I used to love our team. I still love our team.

284
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,720
你知道我觉得问题在哪里吗
Do you know what I think the problem is?

285
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,280
我们的明星前锋不在了
We're missing our star striker.

286
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,570
他没法上场  这是违反规则的
No way can he can play. It's against the rules.

287
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,410
坐在替补席上要他怎么得分
He can hardly score goals from the bench.

288
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,730
他想看比赛都不行
He can't even watch the match.

289
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,040
-他被禁止观看比赛  -没错
- He's forbidden from watching the match. - Absolutely. 

290
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,930
所以我有时候就想  说不定呢
So I am thinking that, from time to time, maybe

291
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,760
-我可以找人和你聊聊战术打法  -丹尼
- I could get someone to talk to you about our attacking game. - Danny.

292
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,330
要是你不自在  门在那边  我说的是门
The door's over there if you're feeling uncomfortable. Well, I say a door.

293
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,830
你要制定出更好的临门策略
You need a better goal mouth strategy.

294
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,760
-老天  别这样  -这怎么了
- Christ, don't do that. - What's the matter?

295
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,910
-怎么了  你说怎么了  -特雷弗
- What's the matter? What's the matter? - Trevor.

296
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,190
-你好  -这有什么
- Hi. - What's the matter?

297
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,430
你知道自己在做什么吧
You do know what it is you're doing,

298
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,020
知道我们在做什么吧
what we're doing, don't you?

299
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,240
-我们究竟在做什么呢  -聊天
- What is it we're doing exactly? - We're talking.

300
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,380
聊足球
About football.

301
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,620
-看嘛  男人聊足球  -没什么不对的
- Here we are, men talking about football. - Nothing wrong with that.

302
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,730
区别在于  球员在比赛前聊足球
Except when footballers talk about football before a match

303
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,580
又不会丢掉饭碗  对吧
they don't lose their jobs, do they?

304
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,340
我知道这是不情之请
I know this is a big ask.

305
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,750
听着  我明白
Look, I appreciate

306
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,740
你肯定希望梅菲尔德选别人
you must have been hoping that Mayfield would pick someone else,

307
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,600
选个更适合处理这种事的律师
someone more suited, perhaps, to something like this,

308
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,540
但事实上  大家都有工作在身
but the fact is, everyone else was gainfully employed and,

309
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,130
很遗憾只能是我了
well, I'm just sorry it had to be me.

310
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,830
-你是事务所最努力的律师  -我...
- You're the hardest-working barrister in the set. - Well, I...

311
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,200
谢谢  但是
Thank you. All the same,

312
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:35,160
-我要考虑考虑  -福伊尔有个储物间
- I need to think about it. - Foyle had a storage unit.

313
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,680
桑德拉·马林斯一案中他跟我们交代过
He told us about it during the Sandra Mullins trial.

314
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,990
谋杀案六个月前他将其清空并不再付费
He cleared it out and stop paying for it six months before the murder.

315
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,890
在诉讼过程当中没有用到这一细节
It played no further part in the proceedings.

316
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,410
有人帮他接管了
Someone took it on after him.

317
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,490
一个叫艾琳·莫里斯的女人
Her name is Eileen Morris.

318
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,650
要是调查没有进展
If something's not turning up it

319
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,510
就意味着你要换个角度入手
just might mean you need to look for it somewhere else.

320
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,610
证明推翻假定[拉丁文]
Probatio vincit praesumptionem.

321
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,550

- Thanks for the drink. - You're very welcome.

322
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,820

325
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,180
-他去哪儿  -我还没决定好

326
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,960

327
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,330
我要问你点事
I need to ask you something.

328
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:55,660
你在小屋里没看到那个男人  对吧
In the cottage, you didn't actually see that man, did you?

329
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,680
太黑了
It was dark.

330
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,560
对不起  我不该问的
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

331
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,160
-什么事  -我打扰到你了吗
- What? - Am I disturbing you?

332
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,880
你想干什么  彼得
What do you want, Peter?

333
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,920
能耽搁你一个小时吗
Can you spare an hour tonight?

334
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,150
-现在太晚了  -你没回答我的问题
- It's late. - You didn't answer the question.

335
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,860
今晚我抽不开身
Tonight's a bit difficult.

336
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,420
大家都很忙  亲爱的
Difficult for all of us, my dear.

337
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,430
福伊尔是我们的委托人  他要求会面
Foyle is our client. He's called a meeting.

338
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,490
我们有责任参加
We have a duty to listen.

339
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,680
他听起来很有兴趣
He sounds very interested.

340
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,830
-好的  -说他想起来了什么
- Yeah. - Says he's remembered something.

341
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,250
我已经答应了

00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,650
直接转到语音信箱了
Straight to voicemail.

343
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,410
-找人去看下  -去哪儿
- Send a clerk round. - Where?

344
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,210
哈罗兹
Harrods.

345
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,590
他家  去他家
His house. To his house.

346
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,660
我们不能这么做
We can't do that.

347
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,370
我不会整晚都在这里待着
I'm not staying here all night.

348
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,510
你好  我是凯特  现在不方便接电话
Hi, it's Kate. I'm not here right now,

349
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,820
请留言  拜
but leave a message. Bye.

350
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,240
你好  我是凯特  现在不方便接电话
Hi, it's Kate. I'm not here right now,

351
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,520
请留言  拜
but leave a message. Bye.

352
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:36,490
你好  我是凯特  现在不方便接电话
Hi, it's Kate. I'm not here right now,

353
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,680
请留言  拜
but leave a message. Bye.

354
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,230
你好  我是凯特  现在不方便接电话
Hi, it's Kate. I'm not here right now,

355
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,510
请留言  拜
but leave a message. Bye.

356
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,820
-别怕  -别过来

It's me, it's me, it's me.

358
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,430
老天  你差点眼睛就瞎了
Jesus. You were half a second away from an eye patch.

359
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,720
桑德拉·马林斯是福伊尔杀的
Foyle murdered Sandra Mullins.

360
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,640
你要知道这一点
You need to know that.

361
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,000
庭上你不是这样说的
You said otherwise in court.

362
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,620
我看事情的角度变了
I see things differently now.

363
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,090
如果你对他有疑虑
If you had reservations about him

364
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,780
就应该对此采取行动
you should have acted on those.

365
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,360
他声明自己无罪  而我为他辩护
He claimed his innocence and I spoke for him.

366
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,180
帮他摆脱指控  仅此而已
I lawyered him out of it, that's all.

367
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,130
但我知道是他杀了她  他是杀人犯
But I know he killed her. He is a murderer,

368
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,070
-我对此深信不疑  -这点我无法苟同
- there is no doubt in my mind. - We differ on this point.

369
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,480
我是认真的  你得小心点
I mean it. You need to be careful.

370
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,210
你真是见不得我事业顺利啊  对吗
You can't stand seeing me do well, can you?

371
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:39,070
-这案子对我有帮助  -对你有帮助
- This is good for me. - Good for you?

372
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:42,930
对你的遭遇我深感遗憾  但这是工作
I am truly sorry for what happened to you, but this is a job.

373
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,070
工作就是工作  仅此而已
Work is work. That's it.

374
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,000
福伊尔杀害了凯特
Foyle murdered Kate.

375
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,420
你接了那人的案子  你就危险了
You let that man in, you are risking everything.

376
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,170
不要重蹈我的覆辙
Don't make the same mistake.

377
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,450
晚安  威尔
Goodnight, Will.

378
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,480
说真的  千万别落单
I mean it. Don't be alone.

379
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,610
加德纳  你的...
Gardner! Did your...

380
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,110
朋友找到你了吗
did your friend find you?

381
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,970
-朋友  -对  他按你家门铃
- Friend? - Yeah, he rang your doorbell.

382
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,870
为什么你觉得他是我的朋友
What makes you think it was my friend?

383
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,870
他替你把垃圾倒了
He put your bin bag out.

384
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,350
她...
She...

385
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,440
出行的事由金来安排
King makes the travel arrangements...

386
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,930
全都是凯特的血
Blood was all Kate's.

387
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,600
没找到与福伊尔匹配的DNA
No DNA match to Foyle whatsoever.

388
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,560
那还有别的线索吗
What does that leave exactly?

389
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,630
事发现场威尔对福伊尔的指认
Will's ID of Foyle in the locus,

390
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,360
他的不在场证据  仅此而已
going for this alibi, and that's it.

391
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,040
你竟然还凭着这些成功立案了
Does that even get you through the door?

392
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,220
我们仍需整理一遍关键论点
All the same we need to collate some skeleton arguments

393
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,630
在辩方提出特恩布尔指引时  好将其驳倒
some on how to beat a Turnbull Direction should it come to it.

394
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,630
{\an8}特恩布尔指引  有关目击证人辨认的庭审条款

395
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,090
这就好像在隧道里跟地铁争论一样
That's like arguing with a tube train in a tunnel.

396
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,880
我们还有别的选择吗
I don't see they have much choice.

397
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,500
没有  确实如此
No, well, quite.

398
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,000
多谢你们的帮助  我们说过会支持他的
Yes, thank you for all your help. We said we'd be there for him.

399
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
-没错  我们会的  -具体怎么支持
- Yes, well we will be. - How, exactly?

400
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,980
我们可能忽略了一条线索
I think we've missed a trick.

401
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,180
我一直在翻查以前的档案
I've been digging in the old files.

402
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,390
有一个储物间
There was a storage unit.

403
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,120
是福伊尔在桑德拉·马林斯被杀前租的
Foyle had one before the Sandra Mullins murder.

404
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,380
当时并未将它归为证据
It didn't make it into the evidence

405
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,870
因为他在半年前就将其清空了
because he'd emptied it six months before.

406
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:24,460
然后交给了别人  猜猜接手的是谁
It was passed on to somebody else. Want to guess who?

407
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,940
她提供了不在场证明
She's his alibi.

408
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,790
在自己家里为他做了晚餐
She cooked him dinner at her home.

409
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,820
那好
Ok...

410
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,450
你确定储物间是她租的吗
You're sure she was paying for this?

411
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,280
从那时起就从银行直接付款
Direct debit ever since.

412
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,240
我们没找到跟案件有关的线索
If we're drawing a blank on the link to the locus

413
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,260
{\pos(158.4,92.4)}bei12010年1月到3月  利·福伊尔
2010年4月到12月  艾琳·莫里斯

414
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,440
不代表没有线索
it doesn't mean there isn't one,

415
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,230
只能说明我们找错了方向
it might just mean we're looking in the wrong place.

416
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,350
证明推翻假定[拉丁文]
Probatio vincit praesumptionem.

417
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,600
帮我给负责警官打个电话
Get a call into the OIC for me, will you?

418
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,890
我们要申请搜查令
We need a warrant in motion.

419
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:53,840
与此同时
In the meantime,

420
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,550
我们重新调查艾琳·莫里斯的所有情况
let's revisit all we know about Eileen Morris.

421
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,730
负责警官的电话
The IOC for you.

422
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,170
他终于发现
It's like he's finally worked out

423
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,960
怎么用自己的脑子了
how to switch on his brain.

424
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:24,890
怎么了
What is it?

425
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,800
他们又给我打电话了  问我证词的事
They called me again, about my statement.

426
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,490
你不是给过了吗
I thought you gave one?

427
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,310
他们要我再说一遍
They asked me to clarify it. Again.

428
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:40,470
-你怎么说的  -我告诉他们真相
- And what did you say? - Well, I told them the truth.

429
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,300
我告诉他们我们两个当晚在一起
I told them all about our evening.

430
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,790
那不就行了
Well, there are you, then.

431
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,340
可他们为什么还要我说呢
But why did they need to check up on me like that?

432
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,980
我也不知道
I don't know.

433
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,080
不过没什么好担心的  不是吗
But there's nothing more to worry about,... is there?

434
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,670
是的  应该没什么问题
No, I suppose there's not.

435
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,430
你看起来冻坏了
You look freezing.

436
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,570
进屋坐一会儿吧
Why don't you come in for a minute?

437
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,380
-我得先回家一趟  -就现在
- Oh, I just have to pop home first. - Now,

438
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,770
没问题吧
if that's OK.

439
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,470
好吧  好吧
Ok. Ok.

440
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,630
你会修水壶吗
You know anything about kettles?

441
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,990
插头没插好
Oh, it's switched off at the wall.

442
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,720
这些人  这些律师
These people, these lawyers,

443
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,540
他们看不起你
they don't see you.

444
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,500
你知道吗
Did you know that?

445
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,130
他们没有一点怜悯之心
They don't have an ounce of mercy in them.

446
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,770
老实说  艾琳
And I'll be honest, Eileen.

447
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,710
他们很会操纵别人
They can be very manipulative.

448
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,610
艾琳  我想尽我所能保护你  真的
Eileen, I want to protect you as best as I can, I really do,

449
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,700
但是...
but...

450
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,780
我需要你对自己更肯定一点
I need you to be a little more sure of yourself.

451
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,920
-肯定  -对你自己
- Sure? - Of yourself.

452
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,010
我能做到  没问题
Yeah, I think I can do that, yes.

453
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,980
你来扮演你自己  我来扮演他们
You be you... and I'll be them.

454
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,980
莫里斯女士  你能告诉法庭
Miss Morris, can you tell the court

455
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,110
十二月三日当晚你在哪里
where you were on the evening of the 3rd of December?

456
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,450
我在家里
I was at home.

457
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,750
你当晚吃了什么
And what did you have to eat?

458
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,450
-奶油培根意面  -错
- Spaghetti carbonara. - Wrong.

459
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,040
-意式蘑菇烩饭  -错
- Con funghi. - Wrong.

460
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,690
-不  不是  -不  不是
- No, it's not. - No, it's not.

461
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,430
我不...我不明白
I don't... I don't understand.

462
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,940
你的证言要有底气
Have courage in your conviction.

463
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,830
别被他们吓倒
Don't let them rattle you.

464
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,170
你当晚吃了什么
What did you have to eat?

465
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,250
意面...烩饭...
Spaghetti con... fu...

466
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,430
-我糊涂了  -是吗  艾琳  你糊涂吗
- I'm all confused now. - Are you, Eileen? Are you confused?

467
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,820
糊涂可帮不了我们
Confused doesn't help us.

468
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,350
糊涂只会把一切都搞砸
Confused makes everything go away.

469
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,940
我弄疼你了吗
Am I hurting you?

470
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,510
是的
Yes.

471
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,270
我...弄疼...你了吗
Am... I... hurting... you?

472
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,770
没有
No.

473
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,540
你当天晚上做的晚餐是什么
And what did you make for dinner that night?

474
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:29,270
奶油培根意面
S... Spaghetti Carbonara...

475
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,780
来杯茶吗
Cup of tea?

476
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:50,260
加文  我能问问您的专业意见吗
Gavin, can I ask your expert opinion on something.

477
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,810
-当然  -出庭律师不能指导证人  对吗
- Yes, of course. - A barrister can't coach a witness, correct?

478
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:58,310
这属于严重违纪  会被立即撤换
Gross misconduct. He'd be out in a flash.

479
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,130
那如果是证人指导出庭律师呢
What about a witness coaching a barrister?

480
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,350
我有一个朋友
I have a friend who is displaying

481
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,950
他突然变得很能干
a sudden and surprising burst of talent.

482
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,030
我觉得他在获取帮助
I think he's getting help.

483
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,200
那他不仅在拿自己的职业生涯冒险
Well, he's not just risking his own neck.

484
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,310
还在拿他的案子  他的委托人
He's risking his case, his client,

485
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,770
和他事务所的名誉冒险
and the reputation of his Chambers.

486
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,850
为了你的朋友着想
So, for the sake of your chum,

487
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,730
我建议你查清楚事情真相
I suggest you find out what's going on.

488
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,270
谢谢您
Thank you.

489
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,270
自助仓储

490
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,520
你要看看另一个吗  两个都是我的
Did you need to go in the other one? They're both mine.

491
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,100
我们会查的 
Yes, we will.

492
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,130
有点...抱歉  有点挤
Well, it's a bit of a, sorry, a bit of a squeeze.

493
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,860
这个也是我的
Cos this one's mine as well, so...

494
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,820
他们在储物间发现了一双12码的靴子
They found a size 12 boot in the storage unit.

495
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,250
很有可能与案发地的脚印吻合
It's a strong candidate to match a tread in the locus.

496
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,760
福伊尔穿9码的鞋
Foyle's a size nine.

497
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,690
但这不妨碍他穿大点的靴子
Of course it doesn't stop him wearing a bigger boot.

498
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,630
别管不在场证明了  仔细调查靴子
Forget the alibi, focus on the boot.

499
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,270
要她出庭作证  建立两者之间的联系
Get her on stand and make the connection.

500
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,560
但如果我们把她当作我们的证人
But if we call her as our witness

501
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,080
我们就不能盘问她的不在场证明  对吧
we can't cross examine her on the alibi, can we?

502
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,000
她的不在场证明基于她的良好信誉
Her alibi's based on good character.

503
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,650
很难直接戳破她的证词
It's a hard sell to undermine her directly.

504
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,800
但如果你能利用储物间的证据
But if you show in court

505
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,750
在法庭上证明他们有私下交往
they have an undisclosed connection through the storage unit,

506
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,960
她的证言就不攻自破了
you are undermining her credibility.

507
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,180
如果你能证明那双靴子到过犯罪现场
You may not have to do any of that

508
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,630
那什么都不用做了
if you prove this boot was at the scene.

509
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,200
这是很重要的选择  现在是艰难时刻
It's a big choice. It's bite the bullet time.

510
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,590
你应该往这方面去调查
That's the way you should go.

511
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,270
塔拉来了  快走
Tara's here. Walk away.

512
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,340
塔拉来了  快走啊
Tara's here. Walk away.

513
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,280
证明两者的联系  破坏证词  一箭双雕
Prove the link, undermine her. Double bubble.

514
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,560
还有  要确保搜查令可行
Oh, and make sure that warrant was kosher.

515
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:29,080
-特雷  怎么有点心不在焉  -塔拉
- Trev! Looking a little bit lost there. - Tara. Hi.

516
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,810
-你在这儿干什么  -丹尼也在这儿吗
- What are you doing here? - Is Danny around?

517
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,780
怎么  你看见他了吗
Why, have you seen him?

518
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,060
怎么样
How bad?

519
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,550
她看见哈里斯了  可能也看见你了
She saw Harris. And she may have seen you too.

520
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,520
这下惨了  我们完了
So we're burned. We're done.

521
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,750
接下去怎么办
So what happens now?

522
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,800
只能自求多福了
We cross our bloody fingers.

523
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:27,910
我很抱歉
I'm very sorry.

524
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,120
-我做得有点过了  -没错
- I crossed a line. - Yes, you did.

525
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,920
我最近压力太大了
I've been so stressed about everything.

526
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,350
我知道
I'm sure you are.

527
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,690
一会儿见
See you later.

528
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,050
今天是庭审的第一天
It's the first day of trial today.

529
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,340
他们会就证据展开辩论
They'll be arguing about evidence.

530
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,750
陪审团还没来  你知道预审程序
Jury's not in yet. You remember the drill.

531
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,240
这周末我可能带杰米去小屋
Probably going to take Jamie up to the cottage this weekend,

532
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,320
收拾下你的东西
go through your stuff.

533
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,130
我觉得是时候了  这样对他也好  对吧
It's time. It might be good for him, you know?

534
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,560
教育孩子这方面我总是不如你
You were always better at that sort of stuff than me,

535
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,850
现在也只好走一步看一步了
but we'll see how it goes.

536
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,330
那边的事都办完了  我只等出庭作证
That way it's done before I have to take the stand.

537
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,740
所有人都尽力了  他们都很棒
Everyone's done what they can. Everyone's been great.

538
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,000
大家都很爱你
A lot of people really love you.

539
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,320
我们会尽力的  好吗
We'll do our best, OK?

540
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:24,730
我保证
I promise.

541
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,740
放松  不就是找到个靴子  不打紧
Relax. So they found a boot. Big deal.

542
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:51,090
又不是DNA  我们不要松口
It's not DNA. We stick with what we agreed.

543
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,570
落实证据
Finalise the evidence.

544
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:57,970
艾琳会替你作证的对吧  福伊尔先生
Eileen will come through for us,... Mr Foyle?

545
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,450
我们一起吃的晚饭  她会宣誓作证
We had dinner together. She'll confirm that under oath.

546
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:04,040
-这么说靴子不要紧吗  -在我看来是的
- So the boot's not a problem? - Not from where I'm sitting.

547
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,700
就剩他和他的证词了
Just him and what he says he saw.

548
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,900
目前为止是这样
As it stands. Yes.

549
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,580
目前为止
As it stands.

550
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,290
你确定你准备好了吗
You sure you're up for this?

551
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:45,360
好
Right.

552
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:12,680
从这儿开始好吗
Shall we start in here?

553
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,820
来  过来
Hey, come here.

554
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:40,030
没事了  都过去了
It's all right. It's all right.

555
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,310
没事了
It's OK.

556
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,830
-爸爸  -什么事
- Dad? - Yeah.

557
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,880
我能把书放到eBay上卖吗
Can I sell my books on eBay?

558
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,560
你想怎么处理都行
You can do whatever you want with them.

559
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,110
我说不定也会这么做的
I might do the same myself.

560
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:07,210
你  用eBay
You? On eBay?

561
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:09,060
你对电脑一窍不通
You're rubbish with computers.

562
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,080
我就要  怎么着了
Yes. Me. What?

563
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:14,700
不可能  你做不到的
There's no way. No way.

564
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,590
你连怎么开机都不会
You can't even turn a computer on.

565
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,010
你要是做得到我把帽子吃下去
I mean, I would eat my hat.

566
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,430
我连帽子都没有
And I don't even have a hat.

567
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,110
爸爸
Dad?

568
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,790
妈妈说这是意外之喜
Mum said it was a surprise.

569
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,800
好大一个惊喜
A nice surprise.

570
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,350
按5快速拨号  好吗
Speed-dial five, would you, please?

571
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,640
发生什么事了
What's going on?

572
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,180
我要找人谈谈  然后再回来  好吗
I need to speak to someone, then we'll come back, OK?

573
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:55,910
可以拨了吗
Ready to dial?

574
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:59,020
-能现在就回去吗  -按5  按住不动
- Can we go back now? - Press five on that phone and hold it down.

575
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,910
-喂  -你打算什么时候再告诉我
- Hello. - When were you planning on telling me?!

576
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:03,640
是威尔吗
Will?

577
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,960
-等他进监狱了还是永远不说  -听我说
- When he was in jail? Never? - Listen...

578
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:08,400
还是打算把片子寄到我家来
Were you just going to send me an ultrasound in the post?

579
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,630
-你在开车吗  -今晚我要和所有人见面
- Are you driving? - I want a meeting with everyone tonight.

580
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:14,700
你  加文  验尸官  所有人
You, Gavin, the coroner. Everyone!

581
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,850
-挂掉  -听我说
- Hang up. - Listen to me.

582
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,890
抱歉  杰米
Sorry, Jamie.

583
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,130
杰米
Jamie?

584
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,070
我应该更拼命地跟他打
I should have fought him harder.

585
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,260
都是我的错  对不起
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

586
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,520
我不该放弃的
I should've tried again.

587
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,700
杰米  你在说什么
Jamie, what are you saying?

588
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,720
我抓伤了他的头
I scratched his head.

589
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,520
你用手去抓他了
You scratched him with your hands?!

590
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,100
-然后我躲起来了  -你在门后的盒子里
- And then I hid. - You were in a box by the door.

591
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,320
最开始不在那儿
Not the first time.

592
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:02,060
-你挪过位置  -爸爸  小心
- You moved?! - Dad, look out!

593
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,250
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

594
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:21,850
我也是
Me too.

595
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,020
你做个深呼吸  好吗
I just need you to take a nice deep breath, OK?

596
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:35,230
然后告诉我到底发生了什么
And now I want you to explain to me exactly what happened.

597
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,930
喂
Yep.

598
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,690
玛吉  我是彼得
"Maggie, Peter.

599
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,800
法医在小屋里找到了DNA
Forensic team just found DNA at the cottage."

600
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,580
福伊尔的DNA吗
Foyle's?

601
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,170
嗯  那个男孩移动过
"Mmm. The boy moved,

602
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:58,540
他们在水槽底下提取到了样本
they found a sample under the sink."

603
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:02,300
打电话叫玛吉来
Get on the phone and get Maggie!

604
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,580
我要见我的法律团队  不是你  希姆金斯
I want my legal team, not you, Simpkins!

605
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:08,870
你快要把我逼疯了  我再也不想听你说话了
You're driving me up the wall. I can't hear you speak anymore!

606
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:12,110
"是DNA  福伊尔先生  是DNA"
"DNA it is, Mr Foyle. It's DNA!"

607
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:15,380
DNA是什么意思  快让玛吉过来
What does DNA mean?! Get Maggie here now!

608
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:19,880
15层到了  准备开门
"15th Floor. Doors opening."

609
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:25,730
找到的DNA到底是什么DNA
What kind of DNA is the DNA that we've got?!

610
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,410
DNA是从哪儿提取的  希姆金斯先生
Where did this DNA come from, Mr Simpkins!

611
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:38,650
"我无法回答你  福伊尔先生"
"I can't tell you, Mr Foyle."

612
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,060
是头发吗  希姆金斯先生
Is it from hair, Mr Simpkins?

613
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,120
还是精液
Is it from semen?!

614
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,470
-你把他锁起来了  -他说他只想和你谈
- You've locked him in? - He said he'll only speak with you.

615
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:48,560
-你把他锁起来了  -没错
- You've locked him in? - Correct.

616
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,050
我们之前在讨论他的不在场证明
We were discussing his alibi.

617
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:53,280
然后谈话转向了新发现的DNA证据
Then the conversation drifted to the new DNA evidence.

618
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,110
然后你就不管了
And you let it?

619
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:55,460
只是少量的样本
It's only a low sample.

620
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,250
如果我们处理得当
Manifestly unreliable

621
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,740
就能证明这个证据明显不可靠
if we do our job properly.

622
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,820
-可他不会这么想  对吗  -我想是的
- He's not going to see it that way, is he? - I suppose not.

623
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,460
它证明我在那儿
It puts me there.

624
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,480
你在担心发现的DNA
You're concerned about the DNA.

625
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,710
它证明我在案发的小屋里
It puts me in that cottage.

626
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,770
它证明我"在案发现场"  玛格丽特
It puts me "At the locus", Margaret.

627
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,550
现在他们认为我是凶手
And now they think it's me.

628
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,980
他们可能认为这证明你去过小屋
They might think it says you were in the cottage...

629
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,310
从现在开始要变成这样子了  是吧
Is this how it's going to be? Here on in.

630
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,580
你以为我喜欢一辈子就坐在
Do you think I like spending my entire life

631
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,550
一间不通气的屋子里闻他的咖啡味儿吗
sitting in an airless room with his coffee breath?

632
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,830
简直像是颗定时炸弹  活活耗死你
It's like an infernal machine. It chews you up.

633
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,980
不说话  也不听
Doesn't speak. Doesn't listen.

634
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,580
就是滴答滴答往前走
Just keeps moving forward.

635
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,000
而你什么也做不了
There's nothing you can do!

636
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,700
好吧
Ok.

637
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,550
-我们需要做好准备  -我们
- We need to back up for moment. - We?

638
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,550
{\an8}英国律师讨论案情时不得提及客户姓名  必须用第一人称

639
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,130
我们有确凿的不在场证明
We have a very clear alibi.

640
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,710
我们
We?

641
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:55,680
你喜欢用"我们"这个词  是吗
You love it, don't you. "We".

642
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:57,460
我们在同一条船上
We are one and the same.

643
00:49:58,690 --> 00:49:59,960
从庭审的角度看
In terms of this trial,

644
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,490
我们的命运是交织在一起的
our fates are intertwined.

645
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:05,100
但是"我们"不会都去坐牢  对吗
But "We" don't go to prison. Do we?

646
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,520
我们不在小屋里
We were not in the cottage.

647
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,470
对  我们不在
No,... we... weren't.

648
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:16,460
所以我们要弄清楚为何DNA说明的情况相反
So, we need to work out why the DNA would say that.

649
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,970
但这是科学  你不能和科学辩论
But it's science. And you can't argue with science.

650
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,730
我可以  福伊尔先生
I can, Mr Foyle.

651
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:29,330
事实上  我很有说服力
In fact, I can be very persuasive.

652
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,060
很好
Good.

653
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,350
请全体起立
Be upstanding in court.

654
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:47,120
伯顿先生  我知道这样的状况
Mr Burton, I know this is going to be hard for you

655
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,010
对你来说很痛苦
given the circumstances,

656
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:51,590
所以你可以慢慢来
so please take your time.

657
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,620
-我透过窗户看到了他  -他是谁
- I saw him through the window. - Him being?

658
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,460
-利亚姆·福伊尔  -你认识他吗
- Liam Foyle. - He was known to you?

659
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,080
认识  我刚在一次刑事审判中为他做过辩护
Yes. I'd just defended him in a criminal trial.

660
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,250
在此期间你多久见他一次
How often would you say you saw him during that period?

661
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,210
几乎每天都见
Almost daily.

662
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:08,070
在整个庭审期间  六个月的时间
Over the trial period, six months.

663
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:10,830
那天在厨房窗户外盯着你的人
Is there any doubt in your mind whatsoever

664
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:14,400
正是那次庭审期间你每天见的人
that the man you saw during thosetimes

665
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,690
你对此判断
was the same man you saw

666
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,920
有没有产生过任何的怀疑
staring at you through the kitchen window?

667
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:19,950
没有任何怀疑
None whatsoever.

668
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:28,520
加德纳女士
Ms Gardner?

669
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:37,050
伯顿先生  你是一名训练有素的
Mr Burton, you are a practising

670
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:39,970
-刑事辩护律师  是吗  -是
- criminal defence barrister, are you not? - Yes.

671
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:43,450
如果案件中对被告的控诉
If a situation arises where a case against an accused

672
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:47,970
主要依赖证人对被告的指认
depends to a great extent on the identification of the accused,

673
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:51,850
这种情况下法官应该警示陪审团吗
is there a warning the judge should give the jury?

674
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:52,500
应该
Yes.

675
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,760
-这种警示的名称是什么  -特恩布尔指引
- What is that warning called? -It's called a Turnbull Direction.

676
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,580
从你的专业角度看  一个案件
In your professional opinion, is it important for the judge

677
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,690
如此严重依赖目击证人的指认
to warn the jury of the need for caution

678
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:04,280
在陪审团给出判决之前  法官的警示
before convicting anyone in any case that relies so heavily

679
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,470
-是否重要  -是
- on eyewitness identification? - Yes.

680
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:09,780
在此种情况中  法官阁下是否需要
Should the judge, in that situation,

681
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,980
请陪审团仔细调查
ask the jury to closely examine

682
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,710
证人指认时的环境因素
every circumstance in which the identification was made?

683
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:19,480
-是  我可以列出来  -是否...
- Yes. I can list them for you if you like. - Would...

684
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,920
不用  谢谢  我完全可以自己回想起来
No, thank you, I'm more than capable of recalling them on my own.

685
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:27,030
你发现她的尸体时  从窗户里看到了谁
When you found her body, who did you see in the window?

686
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:29,010
我看见利亚姆·福伊尔
I saw Liam Foyle.

687
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:32,580
-你"确定"看见的是他  -是
- You had "No doubt whatsoever" It was him. - Yes.

688
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,510
凯特·伯顿被杀害时
There was a second individual present at the time

689
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,330
现场还有第二个人  是吗
Kate Burton was killed, wasn't there?

690
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:40,830
伯顿先生
Mr Burton?

691
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:43,180
是
Yes.

692
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:48,790
-是你的儿子杰米  对吗  -是
- This would be your son James, is that right? - Yes.

693
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,540
根据他的陈述
Well, according to his statement,

694
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,140
他不能
he was unable to make

695
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:57,890
"辨认出袭击者的样貌"  是吗
"Any identification of the attacker whatsoever." Is that right?

696
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:59,320
他才九岁  当时躲在盒子里
He's nine years old. He was hiding in a box.

697
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,920
我再问一次
So if I might ask again.

698
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:02,530
你是否认为
Is it your understanding

699
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,430
他无法辨认出袭击者
that he was not able to identify the attacker?

700
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:07,820
是
Yes.

701
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,740
因此现场有半数人
So 50 percent of persons present

702
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:14,430
无法明确辨认出袭击者
were not able to give a positive identification of the attacker.

703
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:18,060
伯顿先生  陪审团在判决时
Mr Burton, when a jury convicts,

704
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,940
是否要排除一切怀疑
is it beyond all doubt?

705
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:21,660
是这样规定的对吗
Is... Is that the term?

706
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,550
-合理怀疑  -排除合理怀疑
- Reasonable doubt. - Beyond reasonable doubt.

707
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:30,930
让我们思考一下本案中
Now let's have a think about what might be reasonable

708
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,850
存在的可能  好吗
in this situation, shall we?

709
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:37,070
当你看见那个人时  你指称就是被告
When you saw the man you are alleging was the accused,

710
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:40,820
-福伊尔先生  当时很黑吗  -是的
- Mr Foyle, was it dark? - Yes.

711
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:43,720
-你当时有压力吗  -这算什么问题
- Were you under stress? - Is that a serious question?

712
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,540
-她怀孕了  你知道吗  -伯顿先生
- She was pregnant, did you know that? - Mr Burton.

713
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,690
-法官阁下  -根据行为准则第七部分
- My Lord. - Part Seven, Code of Conduct.

714
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:51,460
请记住在本案中  你是证人
Please try and remember that you are a witness

715
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:54,410
不是律师  伯顿先生
and not counsel in this case, Mr Burton.

716
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,900
法官阁下  我完全能感受到
My Lord, I am fully aware of the tragic circumstances

717
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:57,840
此时此地的悲惨氛围
we have surrounding us

718
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,590
我完全能体会到伯顿先生的巨大痛苦
and I am keenly aware of Mr Burton's incomprehensible loss,

719
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,810
但在本案中
but in the case we have before us,

720
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:06,040
只有不回避伯顿先生的不幸
Mr Burton's distress cannot be avoided

721
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,480
才能保证我的委托人得到公平的审判
if my client is to be given a fair trial.

722
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,040
好吧
Very well then.

723
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,260
当你看见花园里的人时
When you saw the man in the garden,

724
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,160
是否正承受着某方面的压力
were you under stress in any way?

725
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,310
-是  -请你解释何为律师标准投诉
- Yes. - What is a Bar Standards complaint?

726
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:28,580
是一种投诉出庭律师的
It's a formal letter listing a complaint

727
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,620
正式信函
against a practising barrister.

728
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:33,320
你是否收到过这样的投诉
Have you ever received such a complaint?

729
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:35,880
有
I have.

730
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,270
能告诉我们是谁投诉你吗
Can you tell us who wrote that complaint?

731
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:46,470
-我曾经的一个委托人  -请说出他的名字
- A former client of mine wrote it. - His name, please?

732
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,710
利亚姆·福伊尔
Liam Foyle.

733
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,310
房间很黑  你发现妻子倒在血泊里
In a dark room, in the shock and trauma of finding your wife

734
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:58,920
你在震惊和悲伤之中
in a pool of blood on the floor,

735
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:02,950
把她抱在怀里  当时还不知道儿子在哪里
holding her in your arms, still unclear as to where your son was,

736
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:04,840
你看向窗外  看到一个男人
you look up at the window and you see a man,

737
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:08,770
此人最近出于某种原因
a man who recently had been given cause

738
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:11,610
针对你的行为  向律师标准委员会
to make a serious complaint against your conduct

739
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,220
提起了措辞严厉的投诉
to the Bar Standards Board,

740
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:17,700
如果此人消失  则对你非常有利
a man whose absence from your life would be very useful indeed.

741
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:21,090
但并不是他  对吗  伯顿先生
But it wasn't that man, was it, Mr Burton?

742
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:23,690
只是你希望是他
You just wanted it to be.

- You have to Stop her. - A bit late for that.

745
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:09,200
她扭曲事实  颠倒黑白
She's twisting the facts to make them wrong.

746
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,480
她的工作做得不错
Doing a good job of it too.

747
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,820
如果辩护有问题
If Defence had a problem,

748
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,370
当时就应该辩论

How did he know? There's no way he could have known.
