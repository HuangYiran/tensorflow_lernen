114
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:32,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wherever she hides, I will find her.

115
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,170


116
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,340


117
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,090


118
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mia?

119
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

120
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You ok? - Yeah, you all right?

121
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like a Toretto.

122
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's Vince?

123
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's a good question.

124
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll be here.

125
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, we are all over the news,

126
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they are blaming us

127
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for killing of those DEA agents on the train.

128
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which means we just jump to the top of the wanted list.

129
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Feds will get us anywhere, their agents are off the limits.

130
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They are gonna send their best guys,

131
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we gotta get out of here.

132
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One thing we know for sure

133
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is that they wanted this car.

134
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Something's in it. - We find out what it is.

135
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We know what we are up against.

136
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright, listen up. The men we're after are professional runners.

137
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They like speed and guarantee to go down the hardest possible way.

138
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So make sure you got a lot of firearm.

139
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We find them,

140
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we take them as a team and we bring them back.

141
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And above all else, we never ever let them get into cars.

142
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go hunt.

143
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Agent Hobbs? I'm chief of police.

144
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry to hear for loss of your men.

145
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is all this really necessary to apprehend two men?

146
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me tell you little something about these two men.

147
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One's a former Federal officer, been in deep cover for 5 years,

148
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}knows everyway we are gonna come from.

149
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The other one's a professional criminal, escaped prison twice,

150
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}spent half his life on run avoiding folks like you.

151
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if there's anything we can do to help...

152
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two things.

153
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One I need a translator.

154
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright, We have plenty...

155
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Elena Neves. - A patrol officer?

156
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You heard me.

157
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But why? We have many more experienced people.

158
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like her smile.

159
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the second thing?

160
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay the fuck out of my way!

161
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:10,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brian.

162
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is something I have to tell you.

163
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, damn.

164
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What a mess.

165
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where you have been, Vin?

166
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You better check that tone.

167
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You better answer some goddam questions.

168
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it, both of you.

169
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where were you, Vince?

170
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys all over the favelas are asking questions about you.

171
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couldn't get out of there without leading them straight to you.

172
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Had to wait them out.

173
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is such a horse shit, that was your job.

174
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enough O'Conner!

175
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he said he didn't do it, he didn't do it.

176
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go walk it off.

177
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I would love to expand my operations in your country.

178
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But quite frankly.

179
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No business methods are to find.

180
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me tell you a true story.

181
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}500 years ago,

182
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Portuguese and Spanish came to here.

183
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Each trying to get the country from their natives.

184
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Spanish arrived guns blazing,

185
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}determined to prove who is boss.

186
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, the natives killed every single spaniard.

187
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Personally, I prefer the methods of the Portuguese.

188
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They came bearing gifts.

189
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mirrors, scissors, blankets,

190
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}things that the native couldn't get on their own.

191
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, to continue receiving them would require will of Portuguese.

192
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's why all Brazilians speaks Portuguese today.

193
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, if you dominate the people with violence,

194
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they will eventually fight back.

195
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because, they have nothing to lose.

196
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, that's the key

197
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I go into the favelas, and give them something to lose.

198
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Electricity, running water, school room for their kids.

199
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And for that taste of the better life,

200
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I own them.

201
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gentlemen.

202
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,590


203
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,980


204
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,290


205
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pardon me gentlemen.

206
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I almost wish I didn't see it.

207
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Almost.

208
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, Dom.

209
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mia was on that train.

210
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't...I didn't know.

211
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

212
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You set off the deal.

213
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought the job was for the cars.

214
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did not know. All they wanted was the chip.

215
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn.

216
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should have come clean.

217
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on out here?

218
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Nothing. - Please, Dom.

219
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just, let me have the chip.

220
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:43,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can take this to them and set things right.

221
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out!

222
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

223
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out!

224
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never listened to me.

225
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not when I told you he was a cop and not now.

226
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never trusted me.

227
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, look where it's gotten us.

228
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at our family now, I can't go home.

229
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your sister is stuck in this life

230
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and where is Letty, Dom?

231
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's letty?

232
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Plasma cover.

233
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wilkes, I want a list of every place

234
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}within 50 miles that distribute compressed gas tank.

235
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pass me that evidence bag.

236
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Officer Neves, I have been waiting for you.

237
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You asked for me? - I did.

238
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May I ask, why?

239
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My smile is not that great.

240
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your husband was an officer, who was gunned down in favela.

241
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Six months later you up and join the force?

242
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are motivated.

243
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Plus I procure the only one that real can't be brought.

244
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Am I right?

245
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes. - Of course I am.

246
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have got some bad news.

247
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't like my deserve first.

248
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I checked the rail-line like you asked,

249
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:38,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}found a couple of spots where they unloaded the cars.

250
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One set of tracks headed west,

251
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}until it hit the main highway and then disappeared.

252
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the another set of tracks headed east,

253
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}170 inch wheel base, half inch track.

254
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The GT40? That was missing from the manifest.

255
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For the track a couple of miles, pretty easy on the scrub.

256
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't move without leaving signs.

257
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me the damn badges.

258
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The ground rolls into a hard pack and we lost the track too.

259
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not necessarily.

260
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That road hits through hill into the favelas.

261
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couple of years ago it was washed out by a storm.

262
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So is dirt from a mile from where you were.

263
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you headed that way, you will pickup the tracks there.

264
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come prepared?

265
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm motivated.

266
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right then, let's find ourselves a car.

267
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think?

268
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's definitely not just a chip.

269
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at all these side menus here, for data entry.

270
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's check this one.

271
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:09,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that. Same building, same order every week.

272
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a delivery schedule.

273
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's this?

274
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Drugs? - No, that's a dealer pack.

275
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, the most major player they weigh their money,

276
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so they don't have to cost somebody to account it.

277
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right there that's 49 kilos. 49 kilos is a million in twenties.

278
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you are saying each one of these shipment

279
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is worth 10 million dollars.

280
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

281
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought so.

282
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:22,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what is that? A 100 million plus in cash oasis?

283
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That how it keeps it off the grid.

284
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can say this one is razor smart about this pack.

285
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean its whole network right there, just laid out on its inn.

286
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wilkes and Tom go from the middle, rest flank north.

287
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about me?

288
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay here.

289
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,900


290
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Police! Get on the ground!

291
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got Torreto.

292
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Police!

293
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They already know who you are.

294
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go.

295
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You ok here? - Yeah.

296
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Almost, thank you.

297
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They are gonna be looking for the three of us together now.

298
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to split up.

299
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and Mia head south, I will lead them away.

300
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:20,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No. - Dom's right.

301
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got lucky to get away, but what happens next time?

302
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have no choice but to split up.

303
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am pregnant.

304
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I already lost my family once.

305
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am not gonna do that again.

306
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you kidding me? - No.

307
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not going anywhere. Ok?

308
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dom, promise me we stick together.

309
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise.

310
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Family just got bigger.

311
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something doesn't add up.

312
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Toretto and O'Conner.

313
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They stay when they are supposed to run.

314
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:36,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They steal gas and then give it away?

315
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now they killed three Federal agents?

316
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't make any sense.

317
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's what makes sense.

318
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All these guys names are on a list.

319
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They come up, we take'em down.

320
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not a phone call more, not a bullet less.

321
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,900

00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Standard forensics, shoe prints, hair fiber.

323
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prints are all over the car.

00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we track the owner off the vehicle ID.

326

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They are couple of shell companies in between

327

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a electricity corporation owned by a investor named Hernan Reyes.

328
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Investor?

329
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If there is anything illegal happening in Rio,

330
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Reyes is involved.

331
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, then so are we.

332
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you can send a clothes to that guy

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want you on watch in case somebody comes back for something.

336

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mac give me a cross-check on Reyes, full specs.

337
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He goes to the John, I want to know how many times he shakes it.

338
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You got it boss. - Let's go.

339
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's put all this mess together.

340
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that's gonna take a while.

341
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you better get started.

342
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were taking this car apart for a reason.

343
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's put it back together and find out what's missing.

344
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey Dom, what do you remember about your father?

345
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father...

346
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He used to....

347
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he used to have a barbeque every sunday after church.

348
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For everybody in the neighbourhood.

349
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we didn't go to church we didn't get any barbeque.

350
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every single day he was in the shop.

351
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, every single night he was at the kitchen table

352
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with Mia helping her with her homework.

353
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even after she went to sleep he would stay up for few more hours.

354
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So he could learn the next chapter and help her next day.

355
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember everything about my father.

356
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything.

357
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's just it.

358
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know shit about my dad.

359
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't remember him yelling, I don't remember him smiling.

360
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To be honest with you,

361
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't remember what the hell he look like.

362
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had all the memories...he is just never there

363
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ain't gonna be like that, Brian.

364
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't keep running, Dom.

365
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got to get out.

366
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got to get out, now.

367
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right.

368
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is how we are gonna do it.

369
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:17,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are gonna use this into one last job.

370
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are gonna take all the Reyes money.

371
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every dime of it.

372
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then, disappear...

373
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}forever

374
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:35,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}New passports, new life, and no more looking over our shoulder.

375
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And we are just gonna buy our freedom. - That's right.

379
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we are gonna need a team.

380
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright, let's go through the basics real quick.

381

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do we got?

382
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,420

427
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,540

428

00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice stakes.

430
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, the rest were sold out.

431
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, whats this all about, Dom?

432
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why you drag us half way around the world.

433
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because we got a job.

434
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright, so target's name is Hernan Reyes.

435
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He runs the drug scene out there.

436
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:12,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has never been busted

437
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because he doesn't leave a paper trail.

438
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:16,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No paper trails means no banks.

439
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No banks means cash houses.

440
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right.

441
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To tell you exact,

442
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's spread throughout the city.

443
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we are gonna hit them all.

444
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- All of them.  - All of them.

445
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sounds crazy. Bring us to whole another country,

446
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:35,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so that we can rob the dude who runs it.

447
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:38,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought this is business,

448
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}sounds personal to me.

449
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:41,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that what this is?

450
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got love for you all,

451
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but personal ain't good business.

452
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't do this homie.

453
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what we are talking about is a 100 million dollar.

454
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You say what?

455
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See, sometimes I be over-thinking,

456
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:03,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}maybe and you know I know...we just met...but,

457
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:04,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you just kinda gotta...

458
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A 100 million dollars.

459
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:09,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And everything we take, we split even.

460
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:11,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, that's 11 million a piece,

461
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am down.

462
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:15,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am in.

463
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}11 million?

464
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sounds like a whole lotta vaginal activity to me.

465
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:23,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't pull off all the heist

466
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on the same mark, you just can't.

467
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, as soon as we hit the first one they are gonna

468
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}do everything they can to protect their assets.

469
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly.

470
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:11,920


471
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all of it.

472
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:31,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're dead men. You're all dead men.

473
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have a place to hide.

474
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:37,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who is hiding?

475
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:40,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you crazy ? Are you crazy?

476
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know whose house this is?

477
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:43,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whose money are you stealing?

478
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:57,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We ain't stealing.

479
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:08,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You tell your boss, exactly who did this.

480
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell him there is more coming.

481
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wallah

482
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:19,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn it over.

483
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Its running alright, checks out fine.

484
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep looking.

485
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boss, if something was missing we would know.

486
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:07,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Its a goddamn shame to put a bullshit like that on a classic.

487
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, as well slap some on light on it.

488
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:22,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They took the chip.

489
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got a hit on the police scanner.

490
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:27,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Armed robbery in the house of golan.

491
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright if that's our guys then

492
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}whatever was on that chip led them directly to that house.

493
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:35,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's them for sure.

494
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:36,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you know that?

495
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because no one else in Rio is stupid enough to rob Reyes.

496
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,300


497
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,510


498
00:48:58,780 --> 00:48:59,480


499
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,770


500
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,270


501
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,600


502
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,450


503
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,310


504
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,210


505
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,470


506
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,230


507
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,800


508
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,350


509
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:59,380


510
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,360


511
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,690


512
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Number 1 is on the move, man.

513
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:45,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two is on the move.

514
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:11,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I got mine.

515
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got eyes on five.

516
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you said they were consolidating money somewhere.

517
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you all ain't gonna believe this.

518
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,090


519
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:18,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, this job has got a little harder.

520
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he is moving it into a police station,

521
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he has got some serious brass in his pocket.

522
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,660


523
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hell yeah, we can't do this.

524
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:31,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't or we shouldn't.

525
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it doesn't change a thing.

526
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:39,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I say we stick to the plan.

527
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You say what?

528
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This shit just went from mission impossible

529
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:45,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to mission freakin' insanity.

530
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:49,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever man!

531
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:50,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I ain't scared. I am just letting you all know.

532
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Going in that bouty, it's just crazy.

533
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What time is robbery?

534
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Around 11' o clock.

535
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:04,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here we go.

536
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:07,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enhance it.

537
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:12,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Their faces are covered. Run it through FRS.

00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:25,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had a life before you know me O'Conner.

651
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:27,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just leave it with that, alright.

652
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She is a beauty, though.

653
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:31,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beauty as in good?

654
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:34,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beauty as in you know... start of playing hard to get.

655
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:38,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, no matter how much I care her, no matter how much I love her

656
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:42,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the end she still ain't gonna give up that ass.

657
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:50,240


658
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,520


659
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:58,720


660
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:09,620


661
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,490


662
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:36,850


663
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,140


664
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,990


665
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:11,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got this, relax man, relax.

666
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:25,220


667
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:41,430


668
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,580


669
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,460


670
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,310


671
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,520


672
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:57,490


673
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:33,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got it, we got it.

674
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we are looking at four cameras.

675
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:39,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, that's some high end shit too. Marker optics.

676
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:43,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They refill the view, 10 seconds oscillation.

677
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:45,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nah, that's a narrow window man?

678
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we just stop the scanner and replace the image.

679
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:49,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nah. Its hooked up into a digital sync.

680
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ain't no way around the system.

681
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The best we can do is peek.

682
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:56,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are gonna need some real fast cars to get to this.

683
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:57,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, not just fast,

684
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we need a hard ride and air.

685
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need something agile.

686
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys mark up a track.

687
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:08,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}O'Conner, lets go get some cars.

688
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:49,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Home, sweet home.

689
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about that? All motors and no tuning issues?

690
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always wanted one of those.

691
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Held the record on the Envadeda 3 years running.

692
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:24,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got a lot of bones to bring your problems here Torreto.

693
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:27,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not to mention a cop.

694
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:30,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we can keep that on the low.

695
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Word on the street is that a lot of people are looking for you two.

696
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:37,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, you didn't think we would recognise you?

697
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what kind of car you own?

698
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:43,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That little cool may run the street around here,

699
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:50,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but that monster has never seen a set ot tail lights, ever.

700
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:51,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well she is about to.

701
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:53,830


702
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:58,590


703
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lets go, legend.

704
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:07,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Car for a car.

705
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:08,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Car for car?

706
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:11,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you want it, come and get it.

707
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:26,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really?

708
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whe...whe...where did you get that from?

709
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Popa's mark.

710
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ok O'Conner, give me your best shot.

711
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How was that one?

712
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Camera caught you.

713
01:05:59,040 --> 01:05:59,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

714
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:01,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah it still caught you.

715
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I will milk the hell out of that thing too.

716
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are gonna need a faster car.

717
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:30,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exactly why your ass ain't been driving.

718
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta re-blaze.

719
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think, I am in love.

720
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was a real solid work,

721
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:52,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I think camera 3 still caught you though.

722
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's do it again.

723
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:06,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's your piggy bank? You kidding me yup?

724
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:10,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where the hell can I get one of these?

725
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:13,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well we had a life before you met us.

726
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright, well I get to work on the electronics tunneler.

727
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:19,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there's still another problem,

728
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:22,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}palm scanner.

729
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:23,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And without Reyes hand-print,

730
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Houdini himself can not open this bitch.

731
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you know it's Reyes's hand-print?

732
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:30,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got 100 million dollars in a safe,

733
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:32,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you gonna put somebody else's hand-print on it?

734
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:42,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are we supposed to get Reyes's hand-print?

735
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:46,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Han, you are up.

736
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:51,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure, gotta make the easy stuff.

737
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:53,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go, I will drive.

738
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That makes six bodyguards.

739
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:14,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seven.

740
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think that guy with a funny look is a tourist?

741
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:24,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, how long were you in the army?

742
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:39,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got out of military probably the same time you quit smoking.

743
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:42,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The amount of chips you ate.

744
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:46,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The way you always had to keep your hands and mouth busy.

745
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are a two packs a day, for sure.

746
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:52,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Un-Filtered.

747
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, this is a bust.

748
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:01,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How you gonna get Reyes fingerprint out of here?

749
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:03,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to do some more recon.

750
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:05,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kinda couple extra guys.

751
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:09,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright, you don't send a man to do a woman's job.

752
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gonna figure this out, I promise you.

753
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:14,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that?

754
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought she was more of a thong man?

755
01:10:18,610 --> 01:10:20,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got the prints.

756
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where?

757
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ok. That's crazy.

758
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:30,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, did he just like slap that ass?

759
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:32,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or, did he like grab and hold on to it?

760
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:36,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This will work.

761
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:39,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm impressed.  - Got it?

762
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:43,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got it. But, you still didn't answer the question.

763
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys! Guys!

764
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:51,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, we have a problem.

765
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The whole team just got burned.

766
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:56,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now we are all wanted.

767
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:00,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hang on a second.

768
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:04,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Us diplomatic security service issued the warrants.

769
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Agent . Hold on a second.

770
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:09,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey Dom.

771
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:14,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that the guy you saw in the favela?

772
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

773
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:20,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hobbs is the leader of the elite task force for the DSS.

774
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:21,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, he is good?

775
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:24,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When the FBI wants to find somebody that's who they call.

776
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:26,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because he never misses his mark.

777
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This guy is...he is old testament.

778
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:33,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blood, bullets, rap the God that's his style.

779
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:35,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And right now he is hunting us?

780
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:38,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dom, we are gonna move up our time line.

781
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, but how?

782
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:40,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This thing has already been difficult.

783
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:43,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it ain't that.

784
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:45,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need more room to breathe.

785
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:48,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Roman is right.

786
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:53,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to get some fresh air.

787
01:11:58,050 --> 01:11:59,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It got a hit.

788
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:01,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's move.

789
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:09,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move! Move! Move!

790
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stopped, about a block ahead.

791
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:19,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Park it, we are going on foot.

792
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:44,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Toretto.

793
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:53,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're under arrest.

794
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:55,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Arrest?

795
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:58,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't feel like I am under arrest.

796
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:00,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about you, Brian?

797
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:01,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nah...not a bit.

798
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:04,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not even a little bit.

799
01:13:04,990 --> 01:13:07,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will just give a minute, it will sink in.

800
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We didn't kill those feds.

801
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's Reyes.  - I don't give a shit.

802
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:17,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just here to bring in two assholes whose names hit my desk.

803
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:20,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that sounds like a real hero.

804
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:24,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's funny.

805
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:26,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From a guy who took the oath of a cop

806
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:28,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then went against everything he stood for?

807
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or, some wanna be tough guy prick

808
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who beat a man half to death with a socket rinch.

809
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:34,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That real tough.

810
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You turn around and put hands behind your back.

811
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think so.

812
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are so mistaken to think you got a goddamn choice boy.

813
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:52,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your mistake ? Thinking you are in America.

814
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:57,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a long way from home.

815
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Brazil!

816
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:20,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on boss, another day.

817
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, it's way too heat.

818
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:32,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will see you soon, Toretto.

819
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am looking forward to it.

820
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:15,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yep.

821
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:16,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tracker's on.

822
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got him.

823
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand. Why come here?

824
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:31,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why risk it all for 20 dollar worth of silver?

825
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:35,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because it's worth it.

826
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:40,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should run,  you know!

827
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hobbs will find you

828
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:49,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have every reason to leave, why stay ?

829
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:57,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you?

830
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:02,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My husband was a good police officer...

831
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:04,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}an honest man...

832
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:07,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we both grew up here.

833
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two years ago, he was murdered in the streets

834
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:12,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}right outside out our door.

835
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:17,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Reyes owns this place.

836
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:19,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He gives things to people.

837
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:23,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, everything has a price.

838
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People here need a new start.

839
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:30,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They need to be free.

840
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:43,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't killed those men in the train, did you?

841
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:51,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, why would you believe anything I would tell you.

842
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was she so special to you?

843
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:11,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never thought anyone could understand how much.

844
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:16,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you do.

845
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:53,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Close, but not enough.

846
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:55,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time window is too small, man.

847
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:59,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only way we can beat the cameras, is with invisible cars.

848
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:03,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I know, just where to get them.

849
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:09,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's take a ride boys.

850
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't hurt yourself.

851
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been a while since i have been behind the wheel of one of these.

852
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}First time I've ever been in the front seat.

853
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:51,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Rom what took you so long.

854
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:52,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought for sure, you be showing up

855
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:54,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with some chrome spinners or something.

856
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:57,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ha.....hah....real funny.

857
01:19:58,870 --> 01:19:59,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a 100,000 that says

858
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:02,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can take you all in the next quarter mile.

859
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:04,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you broke that like you got a 100 grand.

860
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:06,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we pull off this job, I will.

861
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:09,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next two lights, a 100,000.

862
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:13,500

868
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:26,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you say Dom?

01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:28,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are we talking or we racing?

870
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:31,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just don't cheat this time.

871
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:33,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gotta let that go.

921

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to learn how to cook...that's all.

933
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:02,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She might be right.

934

938
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:25,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are less than 24 hours

941
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:30,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is some serious stuff.

942
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:33,500

943
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:34,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, she can't.

944
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:37,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean?

945
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:38,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She can't.

946
01:26:39,370 --> 01:26:40,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean, she can't?

947
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:47,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you serious right now?

948
01:26:48,730 --> 01:26:51,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that the reason you let him beat you in the quarter mile?

949
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:54,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was a baby gift.

950
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:55,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, that's messed up.

01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:56,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, still it's a baby gift.

952
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:58,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you are not taking that from me.

953
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:00,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait...hold on a second.

954
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:04,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did he just smack that ass or, did he grab the ass?

955
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:09,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks. Thank you.

956
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:15,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your boy. Why would you keep something like that away from us.

957
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:16,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did it again, huh.

01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:17,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baby gift?

959
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:21,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have no idea what they are talking about?

960
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:26,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Toast!

977
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:00,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are one hour away from rest of that.

978
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:01,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:22,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just made a big mistake.

982
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:25,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It took me while to find out that tracking chip.

983
01:29:26,290 --> 01:29:27,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, not as long to flip the receiver.

984
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:28,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're going down Torretto.

998
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:36,390

999
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:38,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything all right? Let's go! Let's go!

1000
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:11,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey Dom,

1001

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you didn't meet my son

1002

1004
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:31,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is a good kid.

1005
01:36:36,010 --> 01:36:37,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, we named him after you

1006
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:41,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dominic.

1007
01:36:49,030 --> 01:36:50,590

1008
01:36:57,590 --> 01:36:59,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were always my brother.

1009
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:11,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See you my brother.

1010
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to move, we don't have that much time.

1011
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:26,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got some flight out,

1012
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:28,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that leaves Rio de Janeiro in next 5 hours.

1013
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not to run away....

1014
01:37:31,890 --> 01:37:33,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To finish the job.

1015
01:37:34,370 --> 01:37:37,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you crazy Dom ? We can't.

1016
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:39,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a suicide mission.

1017
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:41,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's your man over there on the table.

1018
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:46,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The plan is busted, this is bullshit man.

1019
01:37:46,730 --> 01:37:47,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Reyes knows we are coming.

1020
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:48,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's right.

1021
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:51,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They tripled the detail of the police station ,

1022
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:54,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's gonna be a wall of gunfire.

1023
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:58,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Reyes doesn't get away with this.

1024
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a trap man, you know that.

1025
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:05,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dom! Listen to them.

1026
01:38:05,830 --> 01:38:07,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run, before its too late.

1027
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave Rio, you can be free.

1028
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:14,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't need freedom.

1029
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:18,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should know that.

1030
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:26,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know you are all free to make your own choices.

1031
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:30,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am in.

1032
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:41,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will ride with you, Toretto.

1033
01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:47,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least, until we kill that son of a bitch.

1034
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what's the plan Dom?

1035
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't just go sneaking around any more.

1036
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:03,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't sneak.

1037
01:39:04,970 --> 01:39:06,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only thing that he cares about is his money.

1038
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:11,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we pull that, we pull him.

1039
01:39:18,430 --> 01:39:19,990


1040
01:39:29,230 --> 01:39:30,220


1041
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:34,190


1042
01:39:35,990 --> 01:39:37,220


1043
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,980


1044
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:43,620


1045
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:46,840


1046
01:39:58,710 --> 01:39:59,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you ready?

1047
01:40:02,230 --> 01:40:03,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm ready.

1048
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:01,990


1049
01:41:02,670 --> 01:41:04,330


1050
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,740


1051
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:18,130


1052
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:23,810


1053
01:41:34,190 --> 01:41:35,100


1054
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:37,120


1055
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:08,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holl it out, Mia?

1056
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:10,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got a straight shot, two blocks.

1057
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:12,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go right.

1058
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:13,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got it

1059
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:37,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow, the plan's working.

1060
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:40,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys have every cop car in Rio on your tail.

1061
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:41,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys have to move fast.

1062
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:43,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the best drop?

1063
01:42:44,030 --> 01:42:47,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ok. Keep going straight another half mile at Du-luff-seeker.

1064
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:48,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then go left.

1065
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:54,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It ain't gonna work

1066
01:42:56,190 --> 01:42:57,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spikes ahead Dom, we got spikes.

1067
01:42:58,020 --> 01:42:58,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are going right.

1068
01:43:00,950 --> 01:43:02,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nah... it's too tight... we are not gonna fit.

1069
01:43:02,450 --> 01:43:03,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have no choice. Now.

1070
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:24,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sh...it!

1071

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys I am hearing all this chatter,

1073
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:35,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you just take out a bank ?

1074
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:46,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two in-Bound.

1075

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alright! There is an ally coming on your left.

1076
