00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,320
<i>Previously on Haven...</i>

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,670
You're the ones that have been kidnapping people, messing with the troubles. Why?

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,700
Audrey Parker.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,000
You don't get to threaten Audrey.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,240
You.

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,960
You put that mark on those people.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,480
They're inferior. All of 'em.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,790
Them, not us.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,610
This isn't actually about some stupid trouble. This is about us.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,080
I love you, and you love me too.

11
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,130
There isn't any part of me that will ever love you.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,930
Not Audrey Parker.

13
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,370
And not Lexie or any other Haven-savers, but there's someone else in there.

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,610
And she is mine.

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,870
Let's move.

16
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,990
Clear the way.

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,010
Hang on, susie. I'm right with you.

18
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,110
She's gonna be okay, right?
The hospital's expecting her.

19
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,440
I love you, susie. That's my girl.

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,700
Don't worry, cliff. I'll be all right.

21
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,250
It's William.

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,770
He's one step ahead of us again.

23
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,660
Well, that sucked.

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,410
What happened? Are you okay?

25
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,590
Yeah, picked up a few stragglers and took 'em to higher ground.

26
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,810
How the hell did this happen?

27
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,320
Doreen hanscomb... the librarian?

28
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,190
Before William put her trouble on steroids,

29
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,960
she'd remember her trip to Hawaii and she'd get sand in her shoes.

30
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,250
Now, a volcano erupts.

31
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,870
All right, I'm gonna go call Jennifer, make sure she's okay.

32
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,220
Let's go home.

33
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,860
THE GREY GULL

34
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,780
William.

35
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,560
He's changing the troubles, and we don't know any of the rules.

36
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,630
And we have nothing.

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,130
What?

38
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,300
Your hair.

39
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,590
This.

40
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,140
It's nice to see Audrey again.

41
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,840
But the real question is...

42
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,720
Who does William think that I am?

43
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,970
Well, uh, he certainly thinks there's something between you two,

44
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,640
 but he's wrong.

45
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,920
Of course.

46
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,240
What?

47
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,400
There's a trouble...

48
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,250
In your bed.
No.

49
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,560
Yeah, I think we should check it out.

50
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,540
I want you to have a look in there.

51
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,380
Nathan?

52
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,590
Nathan?

53
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,530
What?

54
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,270
William.

55
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,530
This is why I don't get pedicures.

56
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,500
No, no, no. Where is my car?

57
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,770
Man.

58
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,310
Just got that car.

59
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,780
Hello?

60
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,050
So the gull is now a bait shop.

61
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,830
BAIT SHOP
I live in a bait shop.

62
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,730
God.

63
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,860
Right, this way. Okay.

64
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,320
All right.

65
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,450
Seriously, so over this.

66
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,400
What kind of trouble takes my shoes?

67
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,650
Oh, thank God.

68
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,400
What?
Ma'am?

69
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,750
What are you doing out here?

70
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,410
Is this a joke?
I don't know, you tell me.

71
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,200
You're the one walking around in your pajamas with no shoes on.

72
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,970
You okay? You need some help?

73
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,570
Duke, come on.

74
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,960
You know my name?

75
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,010
Yeah. I'm Audrey.

76
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,020
Audrey Parker.

77
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,190
You don't know me.

78
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,630
Okay, I'm gonna assume that you don't have any I.D. On you.

79
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,330
No, I don't have any I.D. On me.

80
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,600
So, Ms. Parker, where you heading?

81
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,490
Well, I was heading to Haven pd to find Nathan.

82
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,730
Nathan Wuornos.

83
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,660
There is no Wuornos at Haven pd. You wanna try again?

84
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,180
Okay, listen, this has gotta be some kind of Haven thing, all right?

85
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,120
I woke up this morning, and everything's different.

86
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,200
You're a cop... you look good as a cop, but you're still a cop.

87
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,910
The gull, it isn't the gull.

88
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,750
Let's get in the car, and we'll sort all this out.

89
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,970
You're not really making any sense right now.

90
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,560
You know about this town, though, right?
Ma'am, I know everything about this town.

91
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,330
I'm third-generation Haven pd.

92
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,720
Come on, let's get you off the side of the road.

93
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,100
Come on. Let's go.

94
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,320
It's all right. You're gonna be fine.

95
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,290
Yep, that's right.

96
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,740
Just hop in the back of the car for me.
Back?

97
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,720
Seriously, Duke, I think that something happened to you.

98
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,980
Says the woman who's walking around in her pajamas.

99
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,440
Okay, listen, if you're a cop, then why don't you take me to the station?

100
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,760
You Haven't broken any laws, and I have to make an urgent stop.

101
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,850
If you agree to get a psych evaluation at the hospital, I will help you out.

102
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,400
We will get you some shoes to start with, and I will help you try to find your friend.
Yes.

103
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,410
But first, I need you to wait in the car,

104
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,700
so I can go take this witness statement.

105
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,940
FIND YOUR OWN SLICE OF HAVEN!

106
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,990
Vandalism? That's what you're worried about?

107
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,090
I know.

108
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,730
This town is going to hell.

109
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,300
If I leave you here, you gonna take off on me?

110
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,140
Won't get very far.

111
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,870
Yeah.

112
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,820
Wait in the car.

113
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,500
Vince!

114
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,840
Dave!

115
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,770
I'm sorry. Have we met?

116
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,910
My dear, what ever happened to your shoes?

117
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,570
It's... it's me, Audrey.

118
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,920
Oh, my. I understand what's happening now.

119
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,370
You do? Oh, fantastic, fantastic.

120
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,360
Haven has its first homeless person.

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,600
Vandalism and now vagrancy.
Guys, listen.

122
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,570
I know about the troubles.

123
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,890
My dear, this is Haven.

124
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,110
There's never been any trouble here.

125
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,830
Welcome to HAVEN."The Safest Town In Maine"
Oh, my God.

126
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,720
The troubles are gone.

00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,420
Well, the nurses say you're okay.

131
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,160
A doc's gonna have to sign off before you're officially released,

132
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,660
but, uh, yeah.

133
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,250
Were you able to find out anything?

134
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,600
Nobody named Nathan Wuornos has ever lived in Haven.

135
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,240
I'm sorry.
That's okay.

136
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,670
You know, I'll find him. Always do.

137
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:09,870
Look, um, I don't know exactly what you're going through, but, uh,

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,820
well, you certainly don't have to do it alone.

139
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,280
I'm here if you need to call. That's my cell.

140
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,710
I still can't believe you're a cop.

141
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,110
It's the hair, right? Yeah, the chief hates it too.

142
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,250
And so you keep it.

143
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,560
Yeah.

144
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,730
You might wanna be careful that you don't get fired.

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,750
Oh, that's not likely.

146
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,220
The chief is my dad.

147
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,810
Doctor's ready for you now.

148
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,510
Okay, well, um, thanks for everything.

149
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,020
Meeting you was really unexpected.

150
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,680
Well, the feeling's mutual.

151
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,480
Stay safe.
Right.

152
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,160
Okay.

153
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,250
Ms. Parker, I'm Dr. Hansen.

154
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,010
Nathan.

155
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,940
Nathan... Hansen.

156
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,050
Right, your father was Max Hansen.

157
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,260
You knew him?
Sort of.

158
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,480
Please.

159
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,120
Uh, sorry.

160
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,450
Have... have we met?

161
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,490
Technically yes, but actually not really.

162
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,250
So, no. No.

163
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,010
You're a doctor?

164
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,970
That's what they tell me.

165
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:49,640
Well, your test came back clear, and, uh, the nurse said you were lucid.

166
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,420
But do you mind?

167
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,790
So they found you wandering on the highway?

168
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,880
I was walking. I was not wandering. That's an entirely different thing.

169
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,990
Where were you walking to?

170
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,380
Was looking for someone, but I-I found him.

171
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,500
Good.

172
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,970
The report says that you kept repeating there's some trouble that you needed to fix.

173
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,510
The trouble that I was worried about, it fixed itself.

174
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,240
Good.
Everything is... Perfect.

175
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,730
Okay, Ms. Parker.

176
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:30,040
Audrey Parker, but you... you can just call me Parker.

177
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,210
Okay, Parker, you're free to go.

178
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,220
Great.

179
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,010
This may sound a little weird, but are you doing anything later tonight?

180
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,800
Code blue, room 305.

181
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,000
Excuse me.

182
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,900
All right, I can feel the tear.

183
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,250
Yeah, hemostat now.

184
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,820
Okay, let's get him into surgery.

185
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,310
Boy, am I glad to see you.

186
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,120
Has this day been freaky or what?

187
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,840
Okay, you need to stay right here
Oh, let's think this through.

188
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,050
Who's he gonna believe?

189
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,820
Me or a girl who was here for a psych aluation?

190
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,990
What did you do to Haven?
Please, I didn't do this.

191
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,090
Somebody's trouble stranded us in this boring tourist trap.

192
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,890
You know what's going on?

193
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,950
You're immune to the troubles.

194
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,720
Just like you.

195
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,790
I told you we were connected.
No, we're not.

196
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,950
I gotta get you back to the old Haven, so you can remember who you really are.

197
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,490
And unfortunately, we're gonna need the old troubles to do that, right?

198
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,830
Hey, there's daddy.
Daddy!

199
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,380
Hey, there's my big girl. How you doing?

200
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,210
You guys good?

201
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,360
Your Dr. douche has a family.

202
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,390
Hi, beautiful.

203
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,280
So in love.
Well, good for him.

204
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,980
I'm glad he's happy.

205
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,320
Haven is better without the troubles.

206
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,730
Here's what you don't know.

207
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,760
Deep down... You like the troubles.

208
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,180
Hell, you want the troubles.

209
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

210
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,160
No, you don't, but you will.

211
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,620
And if you're not gonna help me bring the old Haven back...

212
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,450
Then I'm gonna have to do it myself.

213
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,360
And I won't be delicate about it.

214
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,470
Don't get too comfortable being here.

215
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,480
I won't do it.
It's irresponsible.

216
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,770
We could incite panic.

217
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:18,370
If Haven is being overrun by homeless bag ladies, the people have a right to know!

218
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,030
Vincent.
It's our journalistic duty.

219
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,170
Since when are we journalists?

220
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,610
Afternoon, fellas.

221
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,810
Oh, is this about placing an ad?

222
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,520
I'm sorry, but we're in the middle of chasing a story.

223
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,770
Oh, sounds exciting.

224
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,750
No, I'm looking for someone actually, and I know you guys know everyone,

225
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,060
so I thought maybe you could help.

226
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:47,610
I'm awfully sorry, but we don't have a "missed connection" section

227
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,610
<i>here at the herald.</i>

228
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:55,330
Well, I'm sure you'll be able to help... One way or another.

229
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,070
Hi... no, that's fine.

230
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,590
I didn't think you'd call, but, um, I'm glad you did.

231
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,690
Did you find your friend that you were looking for?

232
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,360
Not exactly.

233
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,900
You know, I meant what I said earlier.

234
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,420
I really do wanna help you.
That's why I'm here.

235
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,180
Listen, Haven has a big problem.

236
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,000
You have seen the signs, right?

237
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,470
This is the safest town in...
No.

238
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,930
There's a situation that you need to be aware of.

239
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,520
There is a man, he's extremely dangerous, and I don't think that you're ready for whatever he's planning.

240
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,950
I know that we are a small town, but I know how to do my job.

241
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,690
Listen, that's not what I meant, all right? Hpd needs to take precautions.

242
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,590
You can't just be on defense with this guy.

243
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,640
He's always a step ahead. I can help you.

244
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,340
I can help you find him, I.D. Him, bring him in.

245
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,520
Okay.

246
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,680
I think I know what's going on.

247
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,910
You think I'm Barney fife because you are law enforcement too.

248
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,890
You know, I found an Audrey Parker in the FBI.

249
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,660
But it wasn't you.

250
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,830
You undercover?

251
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,470
It's complicated. 
Oh.

252
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,570
Listen, I know this guy.

253
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,940
All right, who is he?
His name is William.

254
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,440
William.

255
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,860
Does William have a last name?

256
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,140
Right.

257
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,830
Excuse me, I have to take this.

258
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,810
Yeah, this is detective Crocker.

259
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,270
I'll be right there.

260
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,310
What's wrong?

261
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,580
Haven just had its first murder in 42 years.

262
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,450
You knew this was gonna happen.
Who's the victim?

263
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,270
You can see for yourself.

264
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,580
Vince.

265
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,580
And Dave.

266
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,450
I saw you talking to the two of them earlier.

267
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,230
You knew them?

268
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,420
In a way.

269
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,190
Looks like Vince was taken by surprise.

270
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,660
Dave fought back.

271
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,740
He was a tough old guy.

272
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,690
Blonde hair.

273
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,750
William.

274
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,270
Listen, he is trying to set me up, okay?

275
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,600
He planted that there. I- I can explain everything.

276
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,950
Yeah.

277
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,280
And you will.

278
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,220
Get up.

279
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,730
Audrey Parker, you're under arrest.

280
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,880
We both know you don't have enough to charge me, and you can't hold me here indefinitely.

281
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,340
Well, Audrey Parker, I wouldn't have to hold you at all if you'd just be straight with me.

282
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,390
Who are you, and what are you doing here?

283
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,650
Truth, huh?

284
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,870
Listen, what I'm about to tell you is gonna sound really...

285
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,010
crazy. Yeah, I got it.

286
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,960
This whole world... this isn't right.

287
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,240
My Haven, the real Haven, people can do things,

288
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,200
supernatural things, and we call them troubles.

289
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,530
So somebody's trouble turned everything into what it is now.

290
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,200
And only you know about this?

291
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,510
Yes.

292
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,050
And William.

293
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:07,610
And he's killing people to find the troubled person who can change this back.

294
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,210
William, right.

295
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:17,030
Look... I tried to help you.

296
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,260
But this... this is too much.

297
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,800
Okay, Duke, I know you.

298
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,310
In my Haven, you're... you're the criminal.

299
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,460
Please.
Yes, with the same long hair, and you... you do what you want.

300
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,610
You live on a boat, for God's sake.

301
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,090
A boat?
Yeah.

302
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,140
And we're friends.

303
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,030
We trust each other.

304
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,880
We got another body.

305
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,530
Does the name Doreen hanscomb mean anything to you?

306
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,980
Yes.

307
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,260
In my Haven, she was William's last experiment.

308
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,580
He must have thought that she caused this with her trouble, but he was wrong.

309
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,170
Everything's still the same, so he killed her.

310
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,630
I've heard enough.
No, listen!

311
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,060
I'm not crazy, all right?

312
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,590
He's still out there. He'll keep doing this.

313
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,760
You can't leave me in here.

314
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,960
Detective Crocker.
Dr. Hansen.

315
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,520
You're my m. E. Today.

316
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,460
- Yes. - Nice to meet you.

317
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,830
Uh, we've met, actually.

318
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,070
Do you remember?

319
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,410
Third grade. Mrs. pryal's class.

320
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,210
You stole my han solo lunchbox.

321
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:59,110
And I would like to file a formal report and...

322
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,750
I'm just kidding.

323
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,180
I like to joke, I'm...

324
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,580
you may remember that I broke my arm that year, sledding.

325
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,710
Had to be reset twice, hurt like hell.

326
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,070
That is part of the reason that I became a doctor.

327
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,080
Okay, if I say that I remember you, will you stop talking?

328
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,380
Just kidding.

329
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,570
You... you like to joke.

330
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,910
So I guess I got the short straw at the hospital today.

331
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,020
What would it take to get a full-time m. E. In this town?

332
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,970
Well, a lot more murders.

333
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,060
Doc, you signed off on a woman earlier today, Audrey Parker.

334
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,000
You notice anything off about her?

335
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,480
No comment.

336
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,240
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

337
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,940
I'm just... she seemed... she seemed to have a thing for doctors,

338
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,400
but she checked out fine.

339
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,260
Yeah, well, there's no record of her in any system anywhere.

340
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,470
Oh, why are you so interested in her?

341
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,250
No comment.

342
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,200
Knock, knock.

343
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,060
You got a visitor.

344
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,880
It's your lawyer.

345
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,340
I don't have a lawyer.

346
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,860
No, no, it's him. Arrest him.

347
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,570
He's the murderer.
You said she'd try that one.

348
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,930
I know, right?

349
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,220
Wish me luck.

350
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,430
I told him you were delusional.

351
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,880
Oh, come on.

352
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,030
Is that any way to look at the only person like you that you've ever met?

353
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,770
I am nothing like you.

354
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,920
I know this is hard, but someday, you're gonna look back on this and laugh.

355
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,450
- Laugh? - Yeah.

356
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,010
You killed Vince and Dave.

357
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,090
I thought they'd lead me to the troubled person.

358
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,070
My bad.

359
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,060
Ah, and then Doreen.

360
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,060
You thought it was her.
Yeah.

361
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,210
Not her.

362
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,020
And now I'm back to square one.

363
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,100
Thing is...

364
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,360
I hate the legwork.

365
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,900
You know, the suspects and the clues and the...

366
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,280
It's just so time-consuming.

367
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,340
But I know someone who's really good at it.

368
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,110
Audrey Parker.

369
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:24,280
So you are gonna help me find the troubled person.

370
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,030
No.

371
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,830
I wouldn't help you, not in this world or any other.

372
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:34,020
Yeah, you will, 'cause if you don't, more people are gonna die.

373
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:38,560
And people that Audrey Parker cares about.

374
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,920
Don't do this.
This is for your good.

375
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,180
And for you, I will do whatever it takes.

376
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,340
So I'm gonna give myself a little head start

377
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,880
'cause you're a little cranky today.

378
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,300
Guard!

379
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,260
So when you getut of here, I'd hop to it.

380
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,330
Good talk.

381
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,000
Thanks.

382
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,110
I've examined the body and, well, it wasn't an accident.

383
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,560
The killer broke her neck.

384
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,410
How do you know it wasn't an accident?

385
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,670
That's how.

386
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,630
"Nother. "

387
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,120
What do you think it means?

388
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,540
I think it means "not her. "

389
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:49,220
She wasn't killed here. They... somebody dumped the body.

390
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,330
What is this?

391
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,560
You see that underneath her fingernails?
I don't know.

392
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,380
It's not dirt.

393
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,440
No.

394
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,850
It's fiberglass.

395
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,640
That's strange.

396
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,600
Well, I've got the time of death.

397
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,570
About four hours ago, give or take.

398
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,850
Four hours?

399
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,930
No, that's not possible.

400
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,210
Let me check.

401
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,720
Yeah, it is.

402
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,250
Audrey Parker was still in custody four hours ago.

403
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,110
Audrey Parker was your suspect?

404
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,290
No, I...

405
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,930
Just... sorry.

406
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,480
That's my wife.

407
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,020
Hello, honey.

408
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,470
Honey? Marie?

409
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,470
Marie?

410
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:54,130
Hel... guess she hung up.

411
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,610
Well, it's been great working with you.

412
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,540
I think we make a very good team.

413
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,690
Come on.

414
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,850
Your hold is up.

415
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,430
Your lawyer says that we have to let you go.

416
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:12,480
All right, Stan, if that lawyer comes back here, don't trust him.

417
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,460
Okay.

418
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,240
Get some help.

419
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,760
Nut job.

420
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,020
Wow, Nathan, nice house.

421
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,060
Oh, thank God you're all right.

422
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,850
You.
What's wrong?

423
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,200
Okay, whatever you want right now, I can't.

424
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,120
My family is miss
What's...

425
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,700
I am calling the police.

426
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,150
Oh, thank God. That's...

427
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,850
- that's my wife. - Good.

428
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,120
Thank God.

429
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,490
Hi, honey, I... who is this?

430
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,770
It's someone named William. He wants to talk to you.

431
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,940
William, don't hurt his family.
Well, that part's up to you, Audrey.

432
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,030
You find me the troubled person that did this Haven, and I'll give the hansens back.

433
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,240
The hansens are innocent, all right? What do you want with them?

434
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,690
Well, you made it clear to me that you'd sacrifice your happiness by staying here.

435
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,870
But I'm guessing you won't sacrifice. Nathan's happiness.

436
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,360
Find the troubled person, or the hansens die.

437
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,680
See you soon.

438
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,260
It went well.

439
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,020
What the hell is going on?

440
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:35,280
Okay, we don't have time for that.
I am calling the police.

441
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,110
You cannot call the cops, okay?

442
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,870
What?
William wants to deal with me.

443
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,490
Anything you do is gonna put your family in jeopardy.

444
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,640
Who are you?

445
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,910
How am I supposed to trust you?
You don't have any other choice.

446
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:50,080
The person that William's looking for, we need to find him.

447
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,790
Who? Who is he looking for?

448
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,740
The person he's looking for is... Special.

449
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,640
They may view this Haven as different or even bad.

450
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,760
Is there anything weird you've noticed here lately?

451
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,630
Weird? Is there anything that seems weird?

452
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,010
Uh, you mean other than the three murders

453
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,490
and the fact that my wife and daughter have been kidnapped?

454
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,990
There was nothing weird in Haven.

455
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:17,260
There was no crime in Haven until you came.
Yeah, except for the vandalism.

456
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,020
Vandalism? What? Since when?

457
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,600
Wait, so that's new?

458
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,900
What?

459
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,490
Are these your flyers?

460
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,400
What? Who cares?

461
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,650
Yeah. Susie.

462
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,980
In the old Haven, she was injured in an explosion.

463
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,570
Where I'm from, she's married to cliff. But here she's with this guy.

464
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,220
His face was sctched out on one of their signs.

465
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,020
I need to talk to susie. There's an open house.

466
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,510
- Open house. - O... 

467
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,130
we gotta get to this open house.

468
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,750
We're going to an open house?

469
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,540
I don't care that her hold was up! Do you understand that?

470
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,640
She was my only lead!

471
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,020
Get out of my way.

472
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,370
Find her!

473
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,340
Susie and I really think it's the time to jump in.

474
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,720
The Haven real estate market has never been hotter.

475
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,130
Look, there he is again.
Who is that guy?

476
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,150
And why does he keep following us around?
Cliff.

477
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,290
Look, just wait, okay? I'll handle this.

478
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:38,740
Cliff?

479
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,810
Hey, cliff, just hang... hang on.

480
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,430
You know who I am?
Yeah.

481
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,740
Yeah, I do, and I-I know that you're troubled.

482
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,810
I always thought it was some dumb family joke, but it's real.

483
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,920
Yeah. What happened?

484
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:02,900
Susie got hurt back in old Haven because of the volcano troubles, remember?

485
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,310
Right.

486
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,540
Well, she died later that night.

487
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,170
So I wished for the troubles to go away.

488
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,210
I mean, it's just something you say, right?

489
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,570
I never thought it would happen, but then, poof.

490
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,080
Trouble-free Haven.
So wait, you just wished the troubles away?

491
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,280
Yeah.

492
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:28,090
My family always said there's a dark side to every wish.

493
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,750
They were right because she's alive again,

494
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,760
but she doesn't even know that I exist.

495
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,270
Now she thinks I'm some kind of creep.

496
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,270
I just wanted to see her again.

497
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,210
Why don't you just try wishing for something different?

498
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:48,330
That could make things worse than they already are. It's like playing Russian roulette.

499
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,310
The wishes come with a downside.
Right.

500
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:56,710
At least she's alive again, and, well, it looks like she's happy, so...

501
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,300
Even if it's without me.
But wait.

502
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,850
Cliff, what happens if... if something happens to you?

503
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,830
What happens to this version of Haven?

504
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,100
I don't know, it's not like I have some sort of manual.

505
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,100
We can't take any chances, all right? We're gonna get you out of here.

506
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,060
We're gonna keep you safe.
Okay, what are we doing?

507
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,690
Are we making some kind of exchange? No, we can't do that.

508
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:20,010
My family...
I will get them back.

509
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,460
I promise you.

510
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,170
But for now, I mean, all William wants is me, so...

511
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,610
did you... did you call the police?

512
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,640
No. Just wait here.

513
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,790
Duke stay out of this.

514
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:42,000
If you think that Hansen needs protection, let me remind you that I am the cop here.

515
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,830
You have no idea what's going on.
You don't even know where you are!

516
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,680
Okay, I am not crazy, all right?

517
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:53,640
William has been killing people to get to that... Nathan!

518
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,660
What are you doing?

519
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,920
We gotta go. We're wasting time.

520
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,940
Will you just stop and listen?

521
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,320
Do people put up with this where you're from?

522
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:13,200
Look, the dead newspaper men, Doreen hanscomb's murder,

523
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,830
the note carved into her forehead...

524
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:21,130
all of that leads back to one common denominator, and that is you.

525
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,850
Okay, I tried to warn you.

526
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,180
Yeah, you did.

527
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,220
And I believe you.

528
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,620
What?

529
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,200
If this William is fixated on you,

530
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,260
then, well, maybe we can use that to our advantage.

531
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,840
Now can you tell me, where is Hansen taking him?

532
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,090
- To William. - Okay.

533
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,710
You used Nathan's cell phone to find us, right?

534
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,280
You still got a signal?
I sure do.

535
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,600
Okay, then we can use that to track him.

536
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,960
You can fill me on the case details in the car.

537
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,230
Hey, you really believe me?

538
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,570
You were right about the boat.

539
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,830
I always did want one.

540
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,490
Hey, doc, you okay?

541
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,060
Thanks for coming so quickly.

542
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,580
You're gonna get your family back, all right?

543
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,690
I just need your friend.

544
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,470
I'm s... I'm sorry.

545
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,080
It's okay, I would've done the same thing if it was my wife.

546
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,510
Start walking.

547
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,220
It's okay.

548
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:38,560
- Oh, God. - It's okay, it's okay.

549
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,390
Come on, let's get you home. Come on.

550
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,850
Come on.

551
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,040
Listen, I'm... I'm no good to you.

552
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,690
My wishes, they never turn out the way they're supposed to.

553
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:52,930
- You wished for this place? - Yeah.

554
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:56,900
Okay, uh, then I'm gonna have to have you wish to have the old Haven back.

555
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,750
No, no. No, I'll never do that.

556
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,280
Susie's dead there. 

557
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,580
This is gonna be exhausting.

558
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,780
What do you mean you're leaving, Nathan?

559
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,410
Set the alarm. The police are on their way. Tell them everything.

560
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,810
Where could you possibly be going?

561
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,360
I put that man in danger.

562
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,170
I need to help him.

563
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,050
I'll be right back. Okay?

564
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,320
Gun! Drop it! On the floor!

565
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,430
No.

566
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,120
Kick it.

567
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,140
Hey, hon.

568
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,640
How are you?

569
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,500
I've had a rough day.

570
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,260
Let cliff go.

571
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,900
Cliff's our ticket back to old Haven.

572
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,480
Look, William, we can all walk away from this.

573
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,310
Let's just talk.

574
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,680
You son of a bitch.

575
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,980
Why did...
don't move.

576
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,660
I shouldn't have done that.

577
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,830
And I am sorry.

578
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,220
The thing is he doesn't matter.

579
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,950
I mean, none of them matter.

580
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,830
They matter.

581
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,980
This place, it matters.

582
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,400
No. You only think that they do.

583
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,330
You gotta get this idea out of your head that you're some savior here to fix the troubles.

584
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,290
The real you?

585
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,630
You made the troubles.

586
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:37,200
Why do you think you're the one who has to come back to Haven over and over?

587
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,430
Why do you think you're the one who has to deal with the troubles?

588
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,400
You made them.

589
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,920
You made the troubles.

590
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,050
You're being punished.

591
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,450
That's what agent Howard said.

592
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,320
But no, that's... that's not true.

593
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,630
It is.

594
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:15,080
And, um... I know because we did it together and we liked it.

595
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:22,440
So just give him one of your little Audrey pep talks, fix this trouble, and take us home.

596
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,640
Maybe... maybe what you're saying is true.

597
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:38,080
You know about us, about... The troubles, I just... I... I don't know who I am.

598
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,420
It's really scary, you know?

599
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:47,290
I just need you to be... can you just be patient with me?

600
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,710
Freeze.

601
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,210
Drop it.

602
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,560
Drop it.

603
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,200
This might do the trick.

604
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,890
Oh.
Hey, you okay?

605
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,470
What happened?

606
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,090
William.

607
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,020
We need to kill him.

608
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,340
I'm just glad that you're still alive.

609
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,450
Vince and Dave too, of course.

610
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,920
I was a cop.
Yeah, a really good one.

611
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,750
And William shot me? 
Mm-hmm, point-blank.

612
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,580
Yeah, I'm gonna get a bigger gun.

613
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,560
Thanks.

614
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:45,540
Susie died of complications last night. They found cliff shot dead.

615
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,870
William got to him before he could untrouble Haven again.

616
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:51,540
Sorry. William can't get away with this.

617
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,390
Well, we know he's somewhere in Haven. Did you find out anything new about him?

618
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,600
No. Nothing.

619
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:06,620
But detective Crocker did mention that he found fiberglass on William's last victim.

620
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:12,680
It was... it was an industrial grade, like the kind that you build boats with.

621
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,840
Which gets me thinking... Maybe he's using the same hideout.

622
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,650
- Yeah. - Boathouse or repair shop.

623
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,600
Fiberglass boat repair.

624
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,650
Okay, there's only three in the area.
Well, he wouldn't wanna risk getting caught.

625
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,250
Which one's the furthest from where they found Doreen?

626
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,420
Danny's dry dock, but, God, there's no number.

627
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,420
That is because it's a cover.

628
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,390
Yeah.

629
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:42,030
Old man Jessup, he dries out his weed harvest there once a year.

630
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,640
What? It's not my job to arrest him.

631
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,380
Growing season's over.

632
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,770
That makes it the perfect hideout.
Nice work, detective Crocker.

633
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,450
That hurts me.

634
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,470
Okay, come on, guys. Let's go.

635
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,660
- Shotgun. - Shotgun.

636
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,070
Well, I thought you'd wanna finish our conversation.

637
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,560
Just didn't think we'd have an audience.

638
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,410
I didn't come here to talk.

639
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,630
No.

640
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,500
You don't wanna shoot me.

641
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,340
Hey, pal. She really does.

642
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,350
But not for the reason you think.

643
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,190
Let me guess.

644
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,320
You didn't tell 'em.

645
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,600
Well, they have a right to know.

646
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,850
Don't you think? About us?

647
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,300
Shut up!

648
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,200
I like you guys.

649
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:01,590
So I'm gonna tell you everything you wanna know

650
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,790
about who she is and what she's done.

651
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,090
Sorry.

652
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,100
What we did.

653
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,060
Together.

654
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:17,570
'Cause we are so connected.

655
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,760
No!

656
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,770
Audrey.

657
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:30,830
What the..
you're all right, babe.

658
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,030
What the hell's happening?

659
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,250
It's the same wound.

660
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,930
They are connected.

661
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,120
Parker. Parker.

662
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,780
