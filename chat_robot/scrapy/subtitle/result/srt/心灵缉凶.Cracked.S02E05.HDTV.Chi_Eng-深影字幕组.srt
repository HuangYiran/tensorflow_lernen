快点 让开
Come on, get out of the way!

2
00:00:27,074 --> 00:00:28,890
我要进房子里
I'm trying to get into my home.

3
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,411
别越线 那是我的地盘
Don't come across the line,that's my land!

4
00:00:59,104 --> 00:01:02,440
嗨 斯考特
Hey, Scout!

5
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:04,442
我的儿啊 我的儿啊 
That's my boy! That's my boy.

What the... Hold on, Scout.

00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:25,896
没... 门
No... way.

9
00:01:38,842 --> 00:01:40,409
你想打架 我奉陪 
You want a fight, I'll give you a fight! 

10
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,977
得了吧 艾德 走开
Come on, Ed, MOVE!

11
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:45,980
我才不怕你 滚出我的房子
I'm not afraid of you. Get the hell off my property!

12
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:48,283
你已经越界四英尺了
You're 4 feet over the property line!

13
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,285
我知道你在干嘛 你骗不了任何人
I know what you're doing, you're not fooling anyone!

14
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,689
滚出我的地盘 你个脑残笨蛋
Get the hell off my land,you half-brained moron!

15
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,669
救我
Help me!

16
00:02:12,974 --> 00:02:15,575
# 我今早起床 #
I got out of bed today

17
00:02:15,609 --> 00:02:18,678
# 对上帝发誓我看不见我的脸 #
Swear to God I couldn't see my face 

18
00:02:18,712 --> 00:02:21,247
# 我今早起床 #
I got out of bed today

19
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:24,383
# 注视着一缕灵魂 #
Staring at a ghost

20
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:27,219
# 你看到我的灵魂了么 #
Oh have you seen my ghost

21
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:30,022
# 感觉到它了么? 看到它了么? #
Seen my ghost, seen my ghost

22
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:35,027
# 你看到我的灵魂了么 它凝视着地面 #
Oh have you seen my ghost staring at the ground 

23

心灵缉凶 第二季第5集


24
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:44,035
嗨 来时的交通状况太崩溃了
Hey. Traffic coming in was crazy,

25
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,104
由于施工封锁了两个街区
2 blocks were cut off due to construction.

26
00:02:46,138 --> 00:02:48,105
不 不是施工 是爆炸
No, it wasn't construction, there was an explosion.

27
00:02:48,225 --> 00:02:50,908
别太放松了 我想让你们心理分析科去调查
Don't get too comfortable, I want Psych Crimes is to investigate.

28
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:53,110
- 爆炸归轰炸队负责 - 爆炸物处理队 
- Explosions go to bombers. - Explosive Disposal Unit

29
00:02:53,144 --> 00:02:55,045
仍在现场 你们去那里交接
is still on site. You'll take over when you get there.

30
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,981
- 为什么是我们 - 艾德基诺斯基
- Why us? - Ed Janoski,

31
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:59,383
六十七岁 独居 去年因抑郁症
67, lives alone. Briefly hospitalized

32
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:01,318
住过一阵子院
last year for clinical depression.

33
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:03,220
递交过七十份骚扰报告 投诉开发商
Lodged 70 harassment complaints against the developer building

34
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:07,390
在隔壁新建公寓 开发商也投诉了艾德四十回
a condo next door. Same developer filed 40 against Ed.

35
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:10,326
- 投诉哪些方面 - 灯光 施工 
- What kind of complaints? - Lights, construction,

36
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:12,328
卡车压了他的草坪
trucks backing onto his lawn.

37
00:03:12,363 --> 00:03:14,664
根本上来说 这是钉子户和开发商的战争
Basically, it's a war between a hold out and a developer.

38
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,666
不出事我们不会干预太多
We never gave it much attention until now.

39
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:19,902
- 炸弹都用上了 - 别开玩笑了 出发吧
- A bomb will do that. - No kidding. Get over there.

40
00:03:25,475 --> 00:03:27,643
现在 你只会让事情更糟糕
Now, you're just making it worse.

41
00:03:27,677 --> 00:03:30,345
我没弄得更糟 我只是...
I'm not making it worse, I just...

42
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,815
- 他帮不上忙 好吗 - 我们先走访邻居
- He's not helping, OK? - We'll start canvassing

43
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:35,283
做做调查 从他们那儿套出点东西
the neighbours, find out what they have to say.

44
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:37,284
看看他们是否爱沙皇公寓
See if they love the Condo Czar as much

45
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,454
胜过爱自己
as he loves himself.

46
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:42,590
- 基诺斯基先生吗 - 是
- Mr. Janoski? - Yeah?

47
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,593
艾登 布莱克刑警 这是我同事克拉拉马龙
Detective Aidan Black. This is my associate Clara Malone.

48
00:03:45,628 --> 00:03:47,896
一个炸弹把条子都引出来了
Every cop on the beat shows up for a bomb.

49
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,898
之前找你们的时候 你们在哪儿 
Where were you the other times I called? Huh?

50
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:53,099
不用回答了 你们也有份儿
You don't have an answer for that because you're part of it.

51
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:55,295
什么我们也有份儿 基诺斯基先生 
Part of what, Mr. Janoski? 

52
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:56,737
你们得给我哥一个解释
You have to excuse my brother.

53
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:59,372
- 我弟 - 马库斯基诺斯基
- Little brother. - Marcus Janoski.

54
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:01,575
- 这里怎么回事 - 这还不明显吗
- Tell us what happened here. - Isn't it obvious?

55
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,644
有颗该死的炸弹在我房子里爆了
A damn bomb exploded in my house

56
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:05,646
而且他们还不让我回屋
and they won't let me back in.

57
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,647
那可是我的房子
It's MY house!

58
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,325
你们管他们叫的什么炸弹技术员的 
The bomb tech, or F.T.A., 

59
00:04:10,326 --> 00:04:11,483
还是操蛋部队的
or whatever the hell you call them,

60
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,954
半个小时前就走了 我要回屋去
left a half hour ago. I want back in!

61
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,724
我不能让你这么做 先生 这里是案发现场
I can't let you do that, sir. This is a crime scene.

62
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,662
还要多久
How long is it gonna be?

63
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,663
要我在大街上站一整晚吗
I have to stand out in the street all night?

64
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:27,999
不 我们今晚会找地方给你住的
Oh no, we'll find someplace else for you to stay tonight.

65
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,836
我不想整夜呆在别的地方
I don't want to stay somewhere else all night.

66
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:36,441
有什么进展 温蒂
What do we got so far, Wendy?

67
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:38,409
嗨 爆炸始于烟囱
Hey. Blast originated in the chimney,

68
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,410
从壁炉里飞出来
came out of the fireplace.

69
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:44,949
找到一些炸弹碎片 电线 还有电子零件
Found some bomb fragments, some wires, electronics.

70
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:47,317
- 专业作案 - 难说 
- Professional job? - Hard to say.

71
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:49,954
一方面 他做这个花了很多心思
On one hand, someone put a lot of work into making this.

72
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:54,124
用的是旧炸药
The thing is that they used old dynamite.

73
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:56,993
看 冷凝和存储不当导致了晶体产生
See, crystals are from condensation and improper storage.

74
00:04:57,027 --> 00:05:01,097
通常会引起较小且不定的爆炸
Usually results in a smaller, more unpredictable blast.

75
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:03,666
所以是专业级炸弹和业余材料的混搭
So professional level bomb with amateur ingredients?

76
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:04,585
是的 差不多
Yeah, pretty much.

77
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,469
用新炸药会有什么后果
What would have happened with new dynamite?

78
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:10,272
整个屋子都可能会被被炸飞
Probably would have taken out the whole house.

79
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:17,378
斯考特只叫不咬人
Scout's all ba-bark and no bite.

80
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:19,781
真是个迷人精
He's a charmer.

81
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:23,184
肯定不好受吧 住在工地旁边
Must be tough, living with all this construction going on.

82
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:26,066
我老婆的座右铭是 
My wife's motto was, 

83
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,222
"一切终将成为过去"
"This too shall pass."

84
00:05:28,256 --> 00:05:29,523
真是句好座右铭
It's a good motto.

85
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:31,525
她比我更能等
She was better at waiting things out than I am.

86
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:33,961
谁是这里管事的
So who's in charge here?

87
00:05:33,996 --> 00:05:36,396
- 布莱克警探 - 嗨 宝贝小家伙
- Detective Black... - Hey, sonny boy,

88
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:38,398
你该用个火力大点的炸弹才能除掉我啊
you're gonna need a bigger bomb than that to get rid of me!

89
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:40,400
-艾德... - 你想我走的话 最好
- Ed... - You want me out, you better

90
00:05:40,435 --> 00:05:42,402
下次就能把我杀了
make sure you kill me the next time!

91
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:43,655
艾德 这还不是时候 
Ed, this is not the time. 

92
00:05:43,656 --> 00:05:44,671
还有别让我看到你
And get out of my sight!

93
00:05:44,705 --> 00:05:47,473
这男的很明显有神经病
So this man is clearly unhinged.

94
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:48,713
发生什么了
What's going on?

95
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,477
嗨 达米安特伦布莱 这是我的建筑工地
Hi, Damian Tremblay, this is my construction site.

96
00:05:51,512 --> 00:05:53,046
是 我知道
Yeah, I know.

97
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,048
我是布莱克警探 你知道
I'm Detective Black. Do you know anything

98
00:05:55,082 --> 00:05:57,817
- 这里发生了什么吗 - 他当然知道
- about what happened here? - Of course he does!

99
00:05:57,852 --> 00:06:00,753
我只知道我的员工现在在医院
What I know is that I have an employee in the hospital,

100
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:02,988
还有 他的妻儿想知道是怎么一回事
and his wife and his kids are wondering how he got there.

101
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:06,091
你可以告诉他们基诺斯基的家被炸了
Well you can tell them that a bomb went off in Mr. Janoski's house.

102
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:08,560
好的 但你的人威胁说要停止施工
OK, but your people threaten to shut down my operation.

103
00:06:08,594 --> 00:06:10,829
我们要跟你和你的手下谈谈
We're gonna want to talk to you and your whole crew.

104
00:06:10,864 --> 00:06:13,331
只是当前我们没工夫
We just don't have time for that right now.

105
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:15,333
好啊 但我的伙计们一分钟不干活
That's fine, but my men would lose money any minute

106
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:17,334
都是在损失银两
that they're not working.

107
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:20,437
我也一样
And so would I.

108
00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:22,373
你要的人就在这儿
That's the guy you want right there.

109
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:24,876
好吧 也许是他 但现在我要问的人是你
Well, maybe he is. But right now the guy I need to talk to

110
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,541
你愿意去市中心给我们做个陈述吗
is you. You mind coming downtown and giving us a statement?

111
00:06:27,661 --> 00:06:28,794
当然不愿意
I sure do.

112
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:31,948
如果你不帮我们的话我们也帮不了你 先生
We can't help you if you don't help us, sir.

113
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,687
- 看好房子 - 行
- Watch the house. - OK.

114
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:38,689
- 没事的 - 来吧 斯考特
- It's OK. - Come on, Scout.

115
00:06:38,723 --> 00:06:42,793
- 你不能带狗 - 我去哪儿斯考特去哪儿
- Uh, you can't bring the dog. - Scout goes where I go.

116
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:49,364
也行吧 我找个队员牵着她
Why not? I'll have a uniform walk her.

117
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,366
来吧 斯考特
Come on, Scout.

118
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:54,236
为什么你不喜欢狗
What do you got against dogs?

119
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,009
你很了解艾德基诺斯基吗
Do you know Ed Janoski well?

120
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:03,045
- 艾德真让人过目难忘 - 很明显
- Ed is pretty hard to miss. - Apparently he's had

121
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,279
他跟建筑工地有冲突
some conflict with the construction site?

122
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:08,116
艾德跟每个人都有冲突 他很吓人 真的
Ed has conflict with everyone. He's a menace,seriously.

123
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,305
自从施工开始 
Yeah ever since this work started, 

124
00:07:09,306 --> 00:07:11,285
他住的那条街就变成了地狱
it's been hell living down the street from him.

125
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,221
好吧 现在是卖方市场 
Well, it's a seller's market.

126
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:15,223
- 你们搬就行啦 - 要不是艾德从中作梗
- You could just move. - We would have sold already,

127
00:07:15,257 --> 00:07:17,658
- 我们早就卖了 - 怎么会这样呢
- except Ed screwed us over. - How so?

128
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:20,828
达米安特伦布莱想建二期公寓
Damian Tremblay wants to build Phase Two of his condo.

129
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:22,830
我们若肯卖他会给该街区每个人个好价钱
He offered everyone on the block a sweet deal if we sell.

130
00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:25,465
- 比市场价还高 - 但前提是我们都肯卖
- Well above market. - But only if we all sell.

131
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:27,735
- 是的 - 艾德连考虑都没有就拒绝了
- Yeah. - Ed refuses to even consider it.

132
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:29,636
街坊们一定很失望吧
Must've upset your neighbours.

133
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,122
好吧 我看不出有人想炸他 
OK, I can't see anyone bombing him. 

134
00:07:32,123 --> 00:07:34,489
房地产 让人们失去理智 
Real estate, it makes people do crazy things. 

135
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,144
我认识的人中疯到制造爆炸的就只有艾德
Only person I know crazy enough to build a bomb is Ed.

136
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:40,512
而且 老实说 我相信他干得出来
And honestly, I wouldn't put it past him.

137
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:42,514
任何让达米安难堪的事他都会做
He'd do anything to make Damian look bad.

138
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:51,590
- 嗨 - 嗨
- Hey. - Hey.

139
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,759
对我欲罢不能 是吗
Can't get enough of me, can you?

140
00:07:53,793 --> 00:07:55,761
你真是个难戒的习惯
You're a hard habit to break.

141
00:07:55,795 --> 00:07:59,197
- 那是什么 - 早上你忘拿你的剃须刀了
- What's that? - You forgot your shave kit this morning.

142
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:04,836
我刚记起来 因为我花太多时间...
I just figured since I was spending so much time...

143
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:07,472
真尴尬
This is awkward.

144
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:09,473
没事
It's cool.

145
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:11,979
- 反正我在这儿要用 - 你确定
- I need a kit here anyway. - You sure?

146
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:14,932
-百分百 - 好吧
- 100%. - OK.

147
00:08:15,248 --> 00:08:18,615
- 呆会儿打给你 - 前提是我没先打给你
- I'll catch you later. - If I don't catch you first.

148
00:08:20,652 --> 00:08:22,552
他要我死
He wants me gone.

149
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:25,021
他用灯晃我的窗户
He shines lights into my windows,

150
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:26,823
整天钻来钻去
he jackhammers all day,

151
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:29,659
他监视我
he spies on me,

152
00:08:29,693 --> 00:08:31,327
偷我的信件
he steals my mail.

153
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:34,063
你怎么知道他偷你的信件
How do you know he steals your mail?

154
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:37,834
就是因为他 我的电都被断了
My hydro was cut off because of him!

155
00:08:37,868 --> 00:08:40,735
他们说我没交钱 我根本就他妈没收到账单
They said I didn't pay. I say I never got the damn bill!

156
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,905
你觉得这是巧合吗
You think that's a coincidence?

157
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,907
特伦布莱把它们拿走了
Tremblay took them.

158
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,475
他让整个街区的人
He's turned the... 

159
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,178
都跟我作对
whole block against me.

160
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:53,147
别告诉我警察和这没关系
And don't try to tell me that the police aren't in on this.

161
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:55,683
你们忽视了大量的投诉
The number of complaints you've ignored!

162
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:57,055
我们没忽视这事 艾德 
We're not ignoring this, Ed. 

163
00:08:57,056 --> 00:09:00,721
不 你们把我关在这该死的审讯室里
No, you're holding me in a damn interrogation chamber!

164
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:02,456
你还想从我这得到什么 
What do you want from me? 

165
00:09:02,457 --> 00:09:04,158
我已经告诉你是谁干的了
I told you who did it.

166
00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:07,194
你们已经有很多证据了
You already have a lot of proof.

167
00:09:07,228 --> 00:09:08,328
什么证据 
What proof is that? 

168
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:11,064
你们可以去查我的电话记录  
You can check my phone records. 

169
00:09:11,065 --> 00:09:13,266
他不停地给我打骚扰电话
He crank calls me at all hours.

170
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:15,668
用诡异的声音让我去死
Plays weird voices telling me to die!

171
00:09:15,703 --> 00:09:17,704
哪种诡异的声音
What kind of weird voices?

172
00:09:17,738 --> 00:09:21,174
就是那种电话里传出来的声音
The kind of voices that come out of a phone!

173
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,876
他在放录音还是什么的
He's playing recordings or something.

174
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,545
我没疯
I'm not crazy.

175
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:30,964
我告诉你 去查我的电话记录 
I tell ya, check my phone records! 

176
00:09:30,965 --> 00:09:32,251
别担心 艾德 我们会的
Don't worry Ed, we will.

177
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:34,586
那是我的房子
It's my house.

178
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,089
我不会离开的
I'm not leaving it.

179
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:41,025
你没权利把我拘留在这
You've got no right to hold me here.

180
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,261
可以的时候我们会送你回家的 基诺斯基先生
We'll get you home if we can, Mr. Janoski.

181
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:45,263
如果我的房子因为这事不能住了
If my house is condemned because of this,

182
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:47,198
达米安特伦布莱要为此付出代价
Damian Tremblay is gonna pay for this!

183
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,176
嘿 艾德 这是我们的事 
Hey, Ed, that's our business. 

184
00:09:49,177 --> 00:09:50,634
你离他远点 听见没
You stay away from him, you hear me?

185
00:09:52,938 --> 00:09:54,905
当然
Of course.

186
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:58,942
你保护他而不是我
You protect him instead of me.

187
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:02,112
他给你多少钱
How much is he paying you?

188
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:04,414
这家伙是个偏执狂
Guy's paranoid.

189
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:06,750
- 有点吧 - 这是诊断结果
- Somewhat. - Is that a diagnosis?

190
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:08,752
- 差远了 - 就算是 也不是他炸了
- Not even close. - Even so, he didn't blow up

191
00:10:08,786 --> 00:10:11,287
自己的房子 他太害怕失去它了
his own house. He's terrified of losing it.

192
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:13,289
是 他很怕
Yes, he is.

193
00:10:13,323 --> 00:10:15,491
你认为他炸了自己的房子
You thought he blew up his own house?

194
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:18,127
我必须得考虑这种情况 但所幸的是并非这样
I had to consider it. But it doesn't fit, which is good.

195
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:18,674
我喜欢艾德 
I like Ed. 

196
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:20,129
他是个爱发牢骚的混蛋 跟我爸似的
He's a grouchy SOB, just like my dad.

197
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:22,899
好吧 这个不满的混蛋遇到了另一个问题
Yeah, well the grouchy SOB's got another problem.

198
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:24,901
- 就是我 - 什么
- Me. - What?

199
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:27,602
他刚刚用暴力威胁了达米安特伦布莱
He just threatened Damian Tremblay with violence.

200
00:10:27,636 --> 00:10:29,604
不 他没有 克拉拉 不算犯法啊
No, he didn't, Clara, not criminally.

201
00:10:29,638 --> 00:10:31,606
他说的气话 他没有直接威胁
He spoke in anger. He didn't make a direct threat.

202
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,642
我是精神病医生 艾登 我们不会等着
I'm a psychiatrist, Aidan. We don't wait for people

203
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,844
人们去犯罪
to go commit the crime.

204
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,614
如果我们判定他们对自己或他人是种威胁
If we think they are a danger to themselves or others,

205
00:10:39,648 --> 00:10:42,249
并且我们可以治疗 那我们就得让他们住院
and we can treat them, then we need to get them into hospital.

206
00:10:42,284 --> 00:10:44,626
艾德是个典型的处在崩溃边缘的人 
Ed is a classic candidate for a break. 

207
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:45,652
他所承受的压力
The stress he's under,

208
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,188
骚扰 噪音 现在还有炸弹
the harassment, the noise, now a bomb.

209
00:10:48,223 --> 00:10:50,190
所以难道无辜的受害者被关起来
So innocent victim gets locked up

210
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:52,592
而卑鄙的开发商赢了 我不喜欢这结果
and slimeball developer wins? I don't like that outcome.

211
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:55,329
不是关起来 是住院
Not locked up. Admitted to hospital.

212
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,331
我肯定艾德会领会这种区别的
I'm sure Ed's gonna appreciate the difference.

213
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,832
他还没到那地步 但我担心他已经差不多了
He's not there yet, but I'm worried he's on the edge.

214
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:01,634
那我们得做的就是把他拉回来
Then all we have to do is pull him back a little bit.

215
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:03,739
嘿 查下艾德的电话记录 
Hey, check Ed's phone records. 

216
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,638
看看他是否接到骚扰电话
See if he's getting crank calls.

217
00:11:05,672 --> 00:11:08,507
别大惊小怪 艾德基诺斯基可是头号公敌
Wouldn't shock me. Ed Janoski is public enemy number one.

218
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,509
没人喜欢他
Nobody likes him.

219
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,112
- 艾登喜欢 -他当然喜欢了
- Aidan does. - Of course he does.

220
00:11:13,147 --> 00:11:16,681
那达米安特伦布莱呢 有没有什么有趣的发现
What about Damian Tremblay? Did you find anything interesting on him?

221
00:11:16,715 --> 00:11:19,251
我们的公寓沙皇有使用强硬手段的历史
Our Condo Czar has a history of playing hardball.

222
00:11:19,285 --> 00:11:21,453
过去的两年内 
Nine homeowners have filed complaints against him

223
00:11:21,487 --> 00:11:24,556
有九位房主控诉他买房时威吓房主
over the last two years over bully offers to purchase

224
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,225
并且通过行贿来吓走竞争对手
their homes and bribes to scare off competitors.

225
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,867
那些投诉后来怎么样了 
What happened with the complaints? 

226
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:32,163
九户人家把房子卖给他后都撤诉了
All nine dropped after they sold their homes to him.

227
00:11:32,197 --> 00:11:34,031
一个月后 他的极乐境一期破土动工
A month later, he broke ground on Elysium Phase One.

228
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:36,033
现在他在筹划二期
Now he's planning Phase Two.

229
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:39,670
真希望我买了他的公寓 至少他建起来了
Wish I bought my condo from him. At least he puts them up.

230
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:43,174
两年了我还在等着搬进我的公寓去
Two years and I'm still waiting to move into mine.

231
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,678
挺好 他不能买艾德的房子
Nice. He can't buy Ed's house

232
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:49,792
所以他就让它消失 
so he just makes it disappear. 

233
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,423
艾德那条街上其他所有人都想卖 
Everyone else on Ed's street is willing to sell. 

234
00:11:52,424 --> 00:11:53,883
他是唯一不卖的
He's the only hold out.

235
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:55,766
你觉得他们中会有人不顾一切
You think any of them are desperate enough 

236
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:57,153
去炸了艾德的房子来说服他吗
to bomb Ed's house to persuade him?

237
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:59,822
有人会
Someone was.

238
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,862
我们到家了 温馨的家
Here we are. Home, sweet home.

239
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:11,100
终于 我得去看看诺尔玛的画还好吗
Finally. I need to see if Norma's paintings are OK.

240
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:24,078
- 你还好吗 艾德 - 诺尔玛讨厌任何人
- You OK, Ed? - Norma hated anyone

241
00:12:24,113 --> 00:12:27,415
弄乱她的东西 很讨厌 看看 
messing with her things. Hated it. Now look!

242
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:29,550
你们的人一点都不懂尊重 
You people got no respect! 

243
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:31,352
对不起 这是犯罪现场
Sorry, it's a crime scene,

244
00:12:31,387 --> 00:12:33,354
鉴证科只是在履行职责
the forensics unit is just doing their job.

245
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,355
他们没必要对她的物品不恭
They didn't have to disrespect her things!

246
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,357
他们很可能就是故意的
They probably did it on purpose.

247
00:12:37,392 --> 00:12:39,792
特伦布莱可能付钱给他们了
Tremblay probably paid them off.

248
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:41,761
- 喂 让我来帮你吧 - 别碰
- Here, let me help you. - Leave it.

249
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,763
- 我自己能行 - 我相信你能行
- I can do it myself. - I'm sure you can,

250
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,765
但我不介意搭把手
but I don't mind.

251
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,767
好吧
Fine.

252
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:50,869
长画笔放到这个罐子里
The taller brushes go in this jar,

253
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,871
短的放到罐头里
and the shorter ones, in the tin.

254
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,474
诺尔玛喜欢把它们分开放
Norma liked to keep them separate.

255
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,577
- 我能给这些花浇点水吗 - 别碰它
- Can I give these some water? - Don't touch that!

256
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,113
放着我来
I'll get it.

257
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:08,420
- 我回来之前什么都别动 - 没问题
- Don't do anything until I get back. - No problem.

258
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,793
我想知道那儿曾经是什么
I wonder what used to be out there.

259
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:17,795
一个社区
A neighbourhood.

260
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:21,299
别接电话
Don't answer that!

261
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,039
你好
Hello?

262
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,942
滚出房子去不然你死定了
Get out of the house or die.

263
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:34,678
现在就滚 否则你知道后果
Leave now or you know what will happen.

264
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:37,714
滚出房子去不然你死定了
Get out of the house or die.

265
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:40,616
现在你们相信我了吧
Now, do you believe me?

266
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:53,978
我们从轰炸组拿到了初步报告
We got the preliminary report from the bombers.

267
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:57,115
是工业级原料 复杂的电子设备
It's industrial grade material, complicated electronics.

268
00:13:57,149 --> 00:13:59,150
但有趣的是 事实上炸弹
But here's the interesting thing. The bomb was actually

269
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:01,274
是被安在房顶的烟囱顶上的 
planted on the top of the chimney, on the roof. 

270
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,721
我们找到了一个支架
We found a bracket,

271
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:05,790
认为炸弹在前几天夜里的大雨中滑了出来
figure the bomb slipped out in the heavy rainfall the other night.

272
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:07,725
我们确定支架就是为炸弹建的吗
Are we sure that bracket was built for that bomb?

273
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,060
实验室说是的 也就是说他们只想
The lab says yes, which means they just wanted to blow up

274
00:14:10,094 --> 00:14:12,062
把烟囱炸了 并不想杀艾德
the chimney. They weren't looking to kill Ed.

275
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:13,731
他们只想毁坏房子
They just wanted to damage the house.

276
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:15,466
因为这事的重点就是要把房子拆了
Because the whole point is to tear the houses down.

277
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,635
查到什么有关骚扰电话的了吗
We get anything on the crank calls?

278
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:19,636
做这事儿的人用的是预付费手机
Whoever's doing it is using burner cell phones.

279
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,504
每几天就是个新号码
Every few days, it's a new number that calls.

280
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:23,506
我们追查的号码已经没用了
The numbers we ran are already out of use.

281
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,237
好吧 但他还在接到电话 
Well, he's still getting calls. 

282
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:26,509
找到现在的这个号码
Let's find the current number.

283
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:28,478
我们在努力 你看见没
We're trying. You see this?

284
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:31,948
从艾德的监控摄像机上截取的片段识别
Footage Ident salvaged from Ed's security cameras.

285
00:14:31,982 --> 00:14:34,951
这是发生爆炸的前一天
This is one day before the blast.

286
00:14:34,985 --> 00:14:37,619
这应该是嫌疑人 对吧
It's gotta be our suspect, right?

287
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:41,122
不是的几率有多大呢
What are the odds that it's not?

288
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,161
多方便啊
How convenient.

289
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:50,999
对我来说 这很简单
So for me, it's simple.

290
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:54,201
我的工地被关闭的每一天都在消耗
Every day that my site is shut down costs money

291
00:14:54,236 --> 00:14:56,504
我本来能投回社区的钱
that I could be putting back into the community.

292
00:14:56,538 --> 00:14:58,606
识别显示现场已经解禁了
Ident has released the site.

293
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,274
你的问题与我们无关 这位是
Your problem isn't with us. And this is?

294
00:15:01,308 --> 00:15:03,142
米勒温特沃斯公司的普丽娅麦克劳德
Priya McLeod with Miller-Wentworth.

295
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:06,279
我们公司代表特伦布莱先生
Our firm represents Mr. Tremblay.

296
00:15:06,313 --> 00:15:08,281
城市巡视员让我们一直关闭到他们签字同意
The city inspectors have shut us down until they sign off.

297
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:10,283
你可以向他们保证我们的工地是安全的
You could assure them that the site is safe.

298
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:13,305
我是说 若基诺斯基先生能住在他的房子里 
I mean, if Mr. Janoski can live in his house, 

299
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:14,053
那当然我也能施工
certainly, I can work on my site.

300
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:16,989
不好意思 我需要问特伦布莱先生几个问题
Excuse me, I need Mr. Tremblay for questioning.

301
00:15:17,023 --> 00:15:18,461
他是炸弹案的重要证人 
He's a material witness in a bomb case. 

302
00:15:18,462 --> 00:15:19,458
这已经没他事了
He's done here.

303
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:21,494
特伦布莱先生很忙的
Mr. Tremblay has a very busy schedule...

304
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:23,896
不不 没事的 我想尽力帮忙
No, no, it's fine, I want to help out any way I can.

305
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,766
其实 我想这事我就不需要你了
In fact, I don't think I need you for this.

306
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,468
不如你继续向克莉格拉督察申诉我们的案子
Why don't you keep pleading our case with Inspector Caligra?

307
00:15:29,503 --> 00:15:32,136
- 我应该去的 - 我宁愿你待在这
- I should come. - I'd prefer otherwise.

308
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,338
我是来协作的 我想布莱克警探能越快结案
I'm here to cooperate, and I think the sooner Detective Black

309
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:37,375
对大家就越好
closes the case, the better it's going to be for everybody.

310
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,444
这边走
This way.

311
00:15:39,478 --> 00:15:41,546
哼
Hmm!

312
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,148
他应该比这聪明吧
He's supposed to be smarter than that.

313
00:15:44,182 --> 00:15:46,918
不 他很聪明 只是混蛋罢了
No, he's smart enough. He's just a jerk. Ha!

314
00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:49,720
可能吧 但不是他你也穿不上普拉达
Maybe so, but it's guys like that that keep you in Prada.

315
00:15:49,754 --> 00:15:52,823
媚上欺下的主管 忍受不了
Kiss up, kick down. Can't stand the type.

316
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:55,793
即使是游戏 我也可以讨厌玩家
I know it's the game, but I can still hate the player.

317
00:15:55,827 --> 00:15:58,261
或许你站错了边
Maybe you're playing for the wrong team.

318
00:15:58,296 --> 00:16:00,764
我应该讨好你的
I'm supposed to be buttering you up,

319
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,767
- 争取到你 - 我不轻易动摇
- winning you over. - I don't get won over.

320
00:16:04,802 --> 00:16:08,738
让我试试 有机会共进晚餐
Let me try. Any chance you're free for dinner?

321
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:10,740
你不会以为我想花一晚上
You think I want to spend my evening

322
00:16:10,774 --> 00:16:12,886
听你为特伦布莱先生的案子做辩护吧
listening to you plead Mr. Tremblay's case?

323
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:16,211
哈哈 不会的
Ha! Ha! No, not a chance.

324
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:18,213
我在挑逗你
I'm hitting on you.

325
00:16:18,248 --> 00:16:20,582
别故作腼腆
Oh, don't play coy,

326
00:16:20,616 --> 00:16:22,617
我猜这种情况多有发生
I suspect it happens a lot.

327
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:29,458
问题是 你的顾客让你和我调情
The problem is, your client makes hitting on me

328
00:16:29,492 --> 00:16:31,493
产生利益冲突
a conflict of interest.

329
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,869
嘿 我是麦克劳德 我要从特伦布莱辞职
Hey, it's McLeod. I'm resigning from the Tremblay account.

330
00:16:41,903 --> 00:16:45,639
我发现它跟另一个案子...
Well, I discovered that I have a conflict with...

331
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:47,641
有点冲突
another case.

332
00:16:47,676 --> 00:16:50,243
把他交给亨德森
Give him to Henderson.

333
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:53,079
你开玩笑吧
You're kidding me.

334
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,582
利益冲突解决了
Conflict of interest solved.

335
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:59,251
多谢你配合
Appreciate your time.

336
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:01,253
没问题 警探
Not a problem at all, Detective.

337
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,222
那我能为你做什么
So what can I help you with?

338
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,257
告诉我你的保全工作
Tell me about your security.

339
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:08,727
我觉得他们是市里最好的
I think that my security is the best in the city.

340
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,729
有人在过去几晚上
Did anyone see or report anything odd

341
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,631
看到或听到奇怪的事情
in the last couple of nights?

342
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,900
没有吧 我不知道
Nah, not to my knowledge.

343
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:18,504
所以说 没人看到这个
So, no one saw this?

344
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,474
他在基诺斯基先生的房子周围窥视
He was creeping around Mr. Janoski's house.

345
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:25,242
我们认为他最后去了屋顶
We think he ended up on the roof.

346
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:27,912
非常容易被你的保安看到
Would've been easy for your security to spot.

347
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,914
我能说什么呢
What can I say?

348
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:33,618
我雇人看守我的地盘 而不是基诺斯基先生的
My guys are paid to watch my place, not Mr. Janoski's.

349
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,156
所以你的保安没有看到任何人在他房子周围
So your security doesn't see anyone around his house

350
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,859
或者是第二天爆炸摧毁了唯一一个阻拦你
and the next day a bomb goes off in the home of the only person

351
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:45,929
第二期公寓计划发展的人的房子
blocking Phase Two of your condo development.

352
00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:47,931
挺幸运的 不是吗
It's a bit of luck, isn't it?

353
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:50,734
我是建造家园的
I'm in the business of building homes,

354
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:54,671
布莱克警探 而不是炸毁它们
Detective Black, not bombing them.

355
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,548
你可以离开了 特伦布莱先生
You're free to go, Mr. Tremblay.

356
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:07,550
但是我有可能需要再找你谈话
But I may need to speak with you again.

357
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:10,152
随时奉陪 警探
Anytime, Detective.

358
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:14,288
人们认为如果用现金买一次性手机
People think if they buy

359
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:16,891
我们就不能追踪到
a disposable phone for cash, we can't trace it.

360
00:18:16,926 --> 00:18:19,360
但是他们错了
But they're wrong.

361
00:18:19,394 --> 00:18:23,230
我们越来越近了
OK, we're getting close.

362
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:27,535
好惊讶 居然在特伦布莱建筑工地
Surprise, surprise. Tremblay's construction site.

363
00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:31,672
不 显然不是
No, apparently not.

364
00:18:31,706 --> 00:18:33,740
我们十二点回来 妈妈
We'll be back by 12, Mom.

365
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,747
哈里森先生 帕克斯顿女士
Mr. Harrison, Ms. Paxton,

366
00:18:40,782 --> 00:18:43,749
- 这是布莱克警探 - 嗨 有什么事吗
- this is Detective Black. - Hi, can I help you?

367
00:18:43,784 --> 00:18:45,751
我们来这是为了艾德基诺斯基 他最近接到了
We're here about Ed Janoski. He's been receiving

368
00:18:45,786 --> 00:18:48,320
大量骚扰电话
a large number of crank phone calls.

369
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:50,790
我们追踪号码到一部一次性手机
We traced the number to a disposable mobile phone

370
00:18:50,824 --> 00:18:52,858
- 到这个地点 - 你不会碰巧知道
- located at this address. - You wouldn't happen

371
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:54,826
关于它的任何事 对吗 
to know anything about that, would you? 

372
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:56,462
对不起 我们不知道
No, I'm sorry, we don't.

373
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:08,773
大卫哈里森
David Harrison

374
00:19:08,808 --> 00:19:12,276
杰西卡帕克斯顿 你们因为刑事骚扰被捕
and Jessica Paxton, you're under arrest for criminal harassment.

375
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,287
诺尔玛
Norma?

376
00:19:26,925 --> 00:19:30,193
诺尔玛... 是你吗
Norma... is that you?

377
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:33,930
# 今晚我倍感孤独 #
I'm so lonely tonight

378
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,403
# 如果能再拥抱你一次多好 #
If I could only hold you once more

379
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:46,376
# 如果能再亲吻你一次多好 #
If I could only kiss you once more 

380
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,944
你觉得怎么样
How do you like it?

381
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:52,447
# 如果我能再见你 #
If I could only see you

382
00:19:52,481 --> 00:19:55,550
# 只要再一眼 再一眼 #
One more time, one more time 

383
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:59,821
# 哦 #
Oh, whoa-oh

384
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:08,663
# 让你看到我很爱你 #
I'd make you see I love you somehow 

385
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:15,335
# 如果能再见到你多好 #
If I could only see you

386
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,373
# 今晚我倍感孤独 #
I'm so lonely tonight

387
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,799
这不可能是一场意外
There's no way this was an accident.

388
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:33,466
- 你能证明吗 - 我会的
- Can you prove it? - I'll prove it.

389
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:36,536
- 你个人意气用事了 - 这就是私人恩怨
- You're taking this personally. - It is personal.

390
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:38,538
特伦布莱知道我在办这件案子 他还耍花招
Tremblay knows I'm working this case and he pulls a stunt

391
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:42,275
哦 这是一场意外 是的 这是私人恩怨
like this? Oops, it was an accident. Yeah, it's personal.

392
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,277
你们什么时候离开我家
How long before you clear out?

393
00:20:44,312 --> 00:20:47,814
我要一个人呆一会儿 多谢 斯考特 坐下
I'd like some time alone, thank you very much. Sit, Scout.

394
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:49,815
你不能在这里 艾德 他们告诉过你了
You can't stay here, Ed. They already told you.

395
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,751
我不要和你一起 路西尔讨厌斯考特
I'm not staying with you. Lucille hates Scout.

396
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:55,221
- 她会过敏 - 我们可以替你找个地方
- She's allergic! - We can find you a place

397
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:55,930
让你带着狗 
that takes dogs. 

398
00:20:55,931 --> 00:20:57,956
我们排查好之前 你不能住在这里 艾德
You can't be here, Ed, not till we clear this up.

399
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,558
好吧 要多久
Well, how long's that going to take?

400
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,560
多久
How long?

401
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:05,296
还不清楚 对不起
I don't know. I'm sorry.

402
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,935
拜托 艾德
Come on, Ed.

403
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,938
我们在今天结束前需要钢筋到位
We need the rebar in and that next level of concrete poured

404
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,224
下一层混凝土浇好 谢谢 
by the end of the day. Thanks. 

405
00:21:15,225 --> 00:21:15,940
特伦布莱先生
Mr. Tremblay?

406
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,942
警探 放心吧
Detective! Rest assured,

407
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,944
我的保险公司已经在调查此事件
My insurance is already looking into this incident.

408
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,946
我们没有所谓的事件
We don't have an incident,

409
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,548
我们有个模式 当时谁在操作起重机
we have a pattern. Who was operating the crane?

410
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:27,251
是个新人 不熟悉我的机器
New guy. Not very familiar with my equipment.

411
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:29,252
他是个合约工 都算不上是职工
He's a contractor, he's not even an employee.

412
00:21:29,286 --> 00:21:31,254
可能我们需要带你所有成员回市中心
Guess we'll have to bring your whole crew downtown.

413
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:33,256
看起来你又要关门了
Looks like you're shut down again.

414
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,659
- 多久 - 不好说
- How long? - Hard to say.

415
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:47,502
滚出房子不然就去死
Get out of the house or die.

416
00:21:47,536 --> 00:21:50,572
现在不走 你知道会发生什么的
Leave now or you know what will happen.

417
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:56,779
我们从艾德的语音信箱里得到这些
We got this off of Ed's voicemail.

418
00:21:57,113 --> 00:21:59,081
你每天打给他三十次
You called him 30 times a day

419
00:21:59,115 --> 00:22:01,082
在过去的两个月里面
for the past...2 months?

420
00:22:01,116 --> 00:22:04,085
- 这肯定是个误会 - 我们有足够证据
- This has to be a mistake. - There's enough here

421
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:06,087
指控你刑事骚扰
to convict you of criminal harassment

422
00:22:06,121 --> 00:22:09,656
并且发出死亡威胁 最少的刑罚是九十天
and uttering death threats. Minimum sentencing is 90 days.

423
00:22:09,691 --> 00:22:12,359
太疯狂了 对吧 杰西
This is crazy. Right, Jess?

424
00:22:12,394 --> 00:22:14,361
我们有搜查证来搜查
We have a search warrant for your credit

425
00:22:14,396 --> 00:22:16,796
你们的信用卡和负债记录
and debit card records.

426
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,200
我们能够找到什... 杰西卡
What are we going to find... Jessica?

427
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:22,535
好吧 我们应该找个律师谈谈
OK, we should talk to a lawyer.

428
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,138
戴夫 这个男人是疯子
Dave, the man is nuts.

429
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:27,140
他听不进道理 你自己都这么说
He doesn't listen to reason, you've said it yourself.

430
00:22:27,174 --> 00:22:29,175
- 杰西 - 这不对
- Jess. - It's not right.

431
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,444
我们有个机会住在更好的房子里却不能
We have a chance to live in a better house and we can't,

432
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:34,493
就因为艾德除了他自己谁也不在乎
because Ed doesn't care about anyone but himself.

433
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:36,648
里奥 帮我拿下文件
Leo, can you bring me the file?

434
00:22:43,723 --> 00:22:46,791
这是你吗 杰西卡
Is this you, Jessica?

435
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:48,792
杰西 这是你的连帽衫 发生了什么事
Jess, that's your hoodie. What's going on?

436
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:50,728
如果你对我说谎
If you're lying to me,

437
00:22:50,762 --> 00:22:53,864
那是犯罪 你会因此被起诉
that's a crime. And you can be charged with it.

438
00:22:53,898 --> 00:22:56,334
这是你吗
Is this you?

439
00:22:56,368 --> 00:23:00,471
他让我们的生活面临风险
He is putting our lives at risk.

440
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,473
单是对我心理健康的损害
The toll on my mental health alone...

441
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:05,041
你的心理健康
Your mental health?

442
00:23:07,044 --> 00:23:10,880
在你隔壁住着一个孤苦无依的老人人
You're living beside a man who is suffering alone.

443
00:23:10,914 --> 00:23:13,517
他差一点就进了医院 
He's this close to ending up in a hospital, and then

444
00:23:13,551 --> 00:23:17,287
然后在养老院度过余生 而你在干什么
a group home for the rest of his life. And what are you doing?

445
00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:22,625
是呀 我也担心你的心理健康
Yeah, I'm worried about your mental health.

446
00:23:28,398 --> 00:23:31,767
艾德家的事不是意外
The accident at Ed's was no accident.

447
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:33,835
按规矩你要先敲门 请照办
Protocol is you knock first. Respect it.

448
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,604
什么
What?

449
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:39,674
- 特伦布莱是主谋 - 你能证明吗
- Tremblay ordered it. - You can prove that?

450
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,210
我已经控制了那个起重机操作员 他快要招了
I've got the crane operator in holding. He's ready to break.

451
00:23:42,244 --> 00:23:44,512
那你就有了一个刑事毁坏案件
So you've got property damage

452
00:23:44,547 --> 00:23:47,615
和一个可能的民事案件 但是工地事故
and probably a civil case, but the construction accident

453
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,084
没有任何价值 我们要针对炸弹起诉
isn't worth anything. We need to lay charges on the bomb.

454
00:23:50,118 --> 00:23:52,553
他们是同一件事 这里面可能有阴谋
It's all part of the same thing. We might have conspiracy.

455
00:23:52,587 --> 00:23:55,121
打住 我不想听到阴谋一词 艾登
Stop it. I don't want conspiracy, Aidan.

456
00:23:55,156 --> 00:23:57,357
给我找到那个放炸弹的人
Get me the person who set off the bomb.

457
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:59,359
对不起
I'm sorry.

458
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:01,127
我打断了什么吗
Am I interrupting?

459
00:24:01,162 --> 00:24:03,430
- 没有 - 很好
- Not at all. - Great.

460
00:24:03,464 --> 00:24:05,932
你准备要走了
You ready to go?

461
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:08,234
还有其他事吗
Is there anything else?

462
00:24:08,268 --> 00:24:10,603
没事了 谢谢
All good. Thanks.

463
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:17,443
他是谁 前男友
So who's that? An ex?

464
00:24:19,446 --> 00:24:21,414
可比这复杂多了
Way more complicated than that.

465
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:31,656
视野不错
Beautiful view.

466
00:24:31,691 --> 00:24:34,659
我才不喜欢住这么高
If you like construction cranes.

467
00:24:34,694 --> 00:24:37,795
早上我们会来看你的
We'll check on you in the morning.

468
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,497
基诺斯基先生 睡个好觉
Sleep tight, Mr. Janoski.

469
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:44,602
我们来吃点东西
Let's get you something to eat.

470
00:24:44,636 --> 00:24:47,104
够了 我不想你...
That's enough. I don't want you...

471
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,676
等一下
Stay.

472
00:25:07,658 --> 00:25:10,593
猜猜我是谁 十次猜错了九次哦
Ten guesses and the first nine are wrong.

473
00:25:10,628 --> 00:25:13,395
呃... 里奥
Uh... Leo?

474
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,397
你觉得我的手像男人那样粗糙
You think I have man hands?

475
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:18,133
- 里奥的手很细滑 - 噢
- Leo has very soft hands. - Oh.

476
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:20,135
你想吃晚餐了吗  我刚收拾好
You want to grab dinner? I'm just packing up.

477
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:22,137
不行 我已经跟一个... 
Can't. I got a date...

478
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:24,139
监视货车有约了
with a surveillance van.

479
00:25:24,173 --> 00:25:27,142
- 整晚吗 - 有可能 还不太确定
- All night? - Could be. We're waiting on a buy.

480
00:25:27,176 --> 00:25:31,479
- 嗯... - 但很有可能提前回来
- Hmm... - But maybe it'll happen early.

481
00:25:31,513 --> 00:25:33,959
如果回来早的话我来找你 
I'll swing by if it does. 

482
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,182
开门时轻点
Open door policy.

483
00:25:57,438 --> 00:25:59,439
等一下
Just a sec!

484
00:26:14,854 --> 00:26:17,221
- 督察 - 现在
- Inspector? - Right now,

485
00:26:17,255 --> 00:26:19,624
我是戴安
I am Diane.

486
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,397
你是打出租车过来的吧
Please tell me you took a taxi over here.

487
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,434
我虽然喝醉了 但我不傻
I'm drunk, I'm not stupid.

488
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:34,003
我给你拿点水
I'll get you some water.

489
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:36,840
我喜欢这里的布置
I love what you've done with the place!

490
00:26:36,874 --> 00:26:39,676
真是舒适自在
It's homey, homie.

491
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:42,446
你让我... 让我舒适自在
You're my... you're my homey homie.

492
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,949
发生什么事了
What is going on?

493
00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:50,886
是...
Well, it's...

494
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,657
两瓶酒
Two bottles of wine.

495
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:57,793
晚餐 交谈
Dinner, talking,

496
00:26:57,828 --> 00:26:59,928
然后我们亲吻了
and we kissed.

497
00:26:59,963 --> 00:27:03,098
- 跟达米安的律师吗 - 不是
- Damian's lawyer? - Nope.

498
00:27:03,132 --> 00:27:05,900
她甩了他 他不是客户
She dropped him. He's not a client.

499
00:27:05,934 --> 00:27:09,103
毫无利益冲突
No conflict of interest.

500
00:27:11,139 --> 00:27:13,775
但是我只是...
But I just...

501
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:17,245
我认为不太...
I didn't think...

502
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,681
这很好
This is good.

503
00:27:19,715 --> 00:27:21,682
很好 然后呢
Good and?

504
00:27:21,716 --> 00:27:24,451
我只是有点混乱
I'm just kind of messed up.

505
00:27:24,486 --> 00:27:27,988
我看得出来
I can see that.

506
00:27:29,991 --> 00:27:33,660
嗯... 好了
Mmm... Ha! Ha! OK.

507
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:36,462
好了 真是有趣
OK, that was interesting.

508
00:27:36,497 --> 00:27:38,865
来的太及时了
Saved by the door.

509
00:27:38,899 --> 00:27:42,535
等一下
Just a second.

510
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:50,943
- 嗨 - 嗨 陌生人
- Hey. - Hey, stranger.

511
00:27:50,977 --> 00:27:54,613
- 你还没睡吗 - 是啊
- You're up? - Yeah.

512
00:27:54,647 --> 00:27:56,615
来的不是时候吗
Is this not a good time?

513
00:27:56,649 --> 00:27:59,785
额...
Uh...

514
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,485
你认识克莉格拉督察吗 
You know Inspector Caligra? 

515
00:28:03,486 --> 00:28:05,089
不认识克莉格拉督察
No knowing Inspector Caligra.

516
00:28:05,124 --> 00:28:07,492
- 不是个好主意 - 你知道吗
- Not a good idea. - You know what?

517
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:09,493
没事 我要回车上了
It's OK. I gotta get back

518
00:28:09,528 --> 00:28:12,162
我只是抽几分钟休息一下
to the van. I just grabbed a few minutes on break.

519
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:14,364
她刚过来 她喝醉了
She just came by, she's drunk,

520
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,366
她很混乱 你知道的 我们只是朋友
she's all messed up. We're just friends, you know.

521
00:28:16,401 --> 00:28:18,402
不用解释
It's all good.

522
00:28:56,939 --> 00:28:59,540
斯考特 早上好
Morning, Scout.

523
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:01,542
我的宝贝在哪
Where's my boy?

524
00:29:01,577 --> 00:29:04,679
快点 起床了
Come on. Up and at 'em.

525
00:29:04,713 --> 00:29:06,914
我们得回家了
We got to get home.

526
00:29:06,949 --> 00:29:09,416
嗨 斯考特
Hey, Scout.

527
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:12,886
斯考特
Scout?

528
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,956
斯考特
Scout!

529
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:36,074
你个混蛋
You sick bastard!

530

我不知道

561
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:40,065
如果你向银行贷款十万美金
If you borrow $100000 from the bank

562
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:43,634
你无法偿还 银行会怎么做
and you can't pay it back, what will the bank do?

563
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:46,070
我不知道
I don't know.

564

我们在做评估

你要明白 他可能丧失资格

00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:04,553
"丧失资格"

568
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:06,555
艾德...
Ed...

569
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,557
好像不知道
doesn't seem to know

570
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:10,960
他管理财政或健康的基础
the basics of managing his finances or health.

571
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,962
如果他自己无法决定
If he can't function on his own,

572
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:15,531
我只能宣布他弃权
then I have to declare him incapable.

573
00:32:15,565 --> 00:32:19,368
你有授权书吗
Do you have power of attorney?

574
00:32:19,402 --> 00:32:22,804
我试过了 他是不会签的
I tried. He wouldn't sign one.

575
00:32:22,838 --> 00:32:25,778
你愿意以代理人的身份来接手吗
Would you be ready to take over as a substitute decision maker?

576
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:28,810
你得觉得他的治疗
You'd have to make decisions about his treatment.

577
00:32:28,844 --> 00:32:31,346
当然 还要经营他的财产
And run his finances, of course.

578

他一直都很照顾我

我们今天就要结果 不要等到明天 
Let's get it today, not tomorrow. 

581
00:32:47,327 --> 00:32:48,528
他真该卖了这个累赘
He should just sell this dump.

582
00:32:48,562 --> 00:32:51,364
以现在提供给他的 他可以过上更好的生活

艾德在这里已经四十年了
Well, Ed's been here 40 years.

584
00:32:53,401 --> 00:32:55,368
要是他离开的话 他要靠什么为生
If he leaves, what's he going to live for?

585
00:32:55,403 --> 00:32:58,371
无论是谁做的 他们不会善罢甘休的
Whoever's doing this is stubborn. They're not gonna stop.

586
00:32:58,406 --> 00:33:00,840
除非把艾德弄出来
Not until they get Ed out.

587
00:33:08,148 --> 00:33:11,683
你昨天穿的就是这套衣服吧
Weren't you wearing those clothes yesterday?

588
00:33:11,717 --> 00:33:14,786
怎么啦 你有检查我的衣橱吗
What? You're tracking my wardrobe?

589
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:16,822
布劳尔
Brauer?

590
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:21,993
他的朋友们现在在凶案组吗
His buddies in Homicide now?

591
00:33:22,027 --> 00:33:24,996
不关他们的事
It's not their business.

592
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,031
心理战术
Tactical.

593
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:29,300
你知道他是疯子 对吗
You know he's a Habs fan, right?

594
00:33:29,335 --> 00:33:31,302
哈 是啊
Ha! Yeah.

595
00:33:31,337 --> 00:33:33,571

我的人都在这里干坐着
I got guys sitting here doing absolutely nothing.

605

特伦布莱是生意人 我只是按照他的方式做事
Tremblay's a businessman. I'm just speaking his language.

把他要做的所有项目列个单子
Get a list of every project he's got going

613

艾德说对了 所有人都想整他

唯一支持他的人是他弟弟

620
00:34:44,304 --> 00:34:47,173
我刚从实验室拿回报告

630
00:35:22,607 --> 00:35:26,544
"2 4-D 胺500" 只做商品出售
"2, 4-D Amine 500." Only sold commercially.

631
00:35:26,578 --> 00:35:28,478
- 卖给谁 - 高尔夫球场

我们需要一张搜查令
We need a search warrant.

637
00:36:12,026 --> 00:36:14,261
看样子你终于买了艾德的房子

638
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:19,567
马库斯基诺斯基已经要坦白了
Marcus Janoski is ready to talk.

639
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:21,836
您来做这件事
Aren't you just a little bit overqualified

640
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,837
是不是有些大材小用啊 督察
to do this, Inspector?

641
00:36:23,871 --> 00:36:26,272
我知道你的律师团
I know your legal team.

642
00:36:26,306 --> 00:36:28,274
你们准备玩狠的 我们也一样
You're going to bring in the big guns, so are we.

643
00:36:28,308 --> 00:36:31,811
哼 我还没请律师呢
Ha! I haven't even asked for a lawyer yet.

644
00:36:31,846 --> 00:36:33,813
哦 这还用问
Oh! No doubt.

645
00:36:33,848 --> 00:36:37,116
这样你就可以声称被胁迫或者虐待
So you can claim that you were coerced or mistreated.

646
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,385
我想你已经有了主意
I'm sure you have options in mind.

647
00:36:39,419 --> 00:36:41,387
我什么都没做错
I've done nothing wrong.

648
00:36:41,421 --> 00:36:43,389
是么
Really?

649
00:36:43,423 --> 00:36:46,091
基诺斯基被逼疯了终于离开了他的房子
Janoski gets gaslighted out of his house,

650
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:48,594
而你正持有一份合同

651
00:36:48,628 --> 00:36:51,630
准备趁虚而入 你认为陪审团会怎么看
ready to pounce. How's a jury going to see that?

652
00:36:51,664 --> 00:36:54,332
我有权购买它的所有权
I had every right to purchase this property.

653
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:57,334
马库斯找上门来让我买这个房子

654
00:36:57,369 --> 00:36:59,404
而且那场爆炸与我毫无关系
And I had nothing to do with the bomb.

655
00:36:59,438 --> 00:37:02,640
你签了这个合同你就有了动机
When you signed this contract, you gave yourself motive,

656
00:37:02,674 --> 00:37:06,977
特伦布莱先生 你的处境可不太好呢
Mr. Tremblay. You are in a very bad place here.

657
00:37:07,012 --> 00:37:08,979
你想要什么
What do you want from me?

658
00:37:09,014 --> 00:37:11,748
我只不过买了处房产
All I did was purchase a property.

659
00:37:11,783 --> 00:37:14,885
我想让你通过商业的角度理解这个问题的实质
I want you to understand the context from a business perspective.

660
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:17,387
你将面临长达数月的诉讼
You're facing months in court,

661
00:37:17,422 --> 00:37:20,156
打官司的费用 更不用提
legal fees. Oh, not to mention

662
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,893
所有调查员和违规条款
all the inspectors and code violations

663
00:37:22,927 --> 00:37:25,995
都会同时像雨点般砸向你的建筑工地
that will rain down on your building site in the meantime.

664
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:28,631
哈 这... 这将会是
Ha! This...this is going to be

665
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:32,501
你买的最贵的一所小破屋
the most expensive little shack you ever bought.

666
00:37:43,246 --> 00:37:45,480
满意了么
Are you satisfied?

667
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:48,817
差不多了
Getting there.

668
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:50,985
你为什么会安置炸弹
Why did you plant the bomb?

669
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,672
我才不会那么做 
That's the last thing I would do.

670
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:54,656
我们在你工作的地方找到的炸药
The dynamite we found

671
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,259
和法医鉴定报告相符合
in your place of business matches our forensics report.

672
00:37:58,293 --> 00:38:00,260
否认是没用的了 马库斯
There's no point in denying it, Marcus.

673
00:38:00,294 --> 00:38:02,796
你想杀你的亲哥哥
You tried to kill your own brother.

674
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:05,265
不 绝不
No. Never.

675
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:07,300
那个炸弹本不会害死任何人的
That bomb was never gonna kill anybody.

676
00:38:09,303 --> 00:38:11,939
所以我用了老式炸药
That's why I used the old dynamite.

677
00:38:11,973 --> 00:38:15,942
本来是想要造成最小伤害
It was just supposed to cause minor damage, that's all.

678
00:38:15,976 --> 00:38:19,879
所以我把它放在烟囱里
That's why I put it in the chimney.

679
00:38:19,913 --> 00:38:22,214
你根本没想伤害他 你只是想...
So you didn't want to hurt him, you just wanted to...

680
00:38:22,248 --> 00:38:24,249
把他逼疯
make him crazy?

681
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:27,386
你知道什么真正的疯么
You wanna know what's crazy?

682
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,388
我父母过世的时候
When my parents died,

683
00:38:29,422 --> 00:38:31,190
他们把房子留给了艾德 
they left Ed the house, 

684
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:32,958
只留给我他们的毕生积蓄
and me, their life savings

685
00:38:32,992 --> 00:38:35,093
九千美元
of $9000.

686
00:38:38,364 --> 00:38:40,699
这怎么可能公平
How is that fair?

687
00:38:44,003 --> 00:38:46,638
有什么收获
What did you get?

688
00:38:46,672 --> 00:38:49,406
那所房子 而且他要支付维修费用
The house. And he is going to pay damages.

689
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,042
- 不错 多谢 - 客气

690
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:55,679
嗨 艾登 关于昨晚...

691
00:38:55,714 --> 00:38:58,081
哦 我早早就上床了
Yeah, I went to bed early.

692
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:00,083
读了本书 是个很平静的夜晚
Read a book. It was a quiet night.

693
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:02,085
你呢
How about you?

694
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,087
和你差不多 呆在家里
Pretty much the same. Just stayed in.

695
00:39:05,122 --> 00:39:07,757
你应该出去走走 享受生活
You should get out. Have a life.

696
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:09,792
抽空吧
One of these days.

697
00:39:13,363 --> 00:39:15,331
艾德 你生气没关系的
Ed, it's OK to be angry.

698
00:39:15,365 --> 00:39:18,601
别开玩笑了 我是很生气... 夏洛克
No kidding, I'm angry... Sherlock.

699
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:22,337
我连自己亲弟弟都不能信了 还能信谁呢
You can't trust your own brother, who can you trust?

700
00:39:22,371 --> 00:39:25,741
信你自己 艾德 马库斯想把你逼疯
Yourself, Ed. Marcus tried to push you

701
00:39:25,775 --> 00:39:28,043
可别让他得逞
over the edge into a breakdown. Don't let him win.

702
00:39:28,077 --> 00:39:31,112
他已经把我逼疯了 我都住院了 不是吗
He already did! I'm in a hospital, aren't I?

703
00:39:31,147 --> 00:39:35,383
已经准备好开庭了 基诺斯基先生
The board is ready for us, Mr. Janoski.

704
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:38,019
律师 你们可能会把我关在这儿一辈子
Lawyers. You'll probably get me locked up in here

705
00:39:38,053 --> 00:39:41,722
- 我不去 - 再给我们几分钟时间
- for years. I'm not going! - Just give us a minute.

706
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:47,327
艾德 你要去参加那个听证会
Ed, you're going to go into that hearing

707
00:39:47,362 --> 00:39:49,764
告诉他们那房子是属于你的
and show them that you belong in your own house.

708
00:39:49,798 --> 00:39:53,033
没人能帮你做这件事
No one can do that for you.

709
00:39:53,067 --> 00:39:56,036
我知道你很清楚自己的经济状况
I know that you understand your finances perfectly well.

710
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,038
你的确可能需要些小小的帮助
You might need a little bit of help,

711
00:39:58,072 --> 00:40:02,442
但是你不必呆在医院里了
but you don't need to be in a hospital.

712
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:04,410
诺尔玛不会想让你呆在这里的

713

你能做到的艾德

714
00:40:08,347 --> 00:40:11,584
别对我说教
Don't patronize me.

715
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:14,920
你想寻求优越感么 替别人换便盆去吧
You want to feel superior, go change somebody's bedpan.

716
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:16,956
我能照顾好我自己
I can take care of myself.

717
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,968
准备好了吗
You ready?

718
00:40:30,002 --> 00:40:34,739
这让我想起了我和诺尔玛结婚那天
It reminds me of the day Norma and I got married.

719
00:40:34,773 --> 00:40:36,741
时机刚好

720

希望我没打扰到你们
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

721

特伦布莱先生有话说

723

724
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:49,452
表达我诚挚的歉意
I would like to offer a sincere apology

725
00:40:49,487 --> 00:40:52,489
如果我们的施工对你产生了任何不便

726
00:40:52,523 --> 00:40:54,491
我希望
And I hope that that

727
00:40:54,525 --> 00:40:57,693
这可以弥补您的损失
is enough to cover the damages to your house.

728
00:40:57,728 --> 00:41:00,029
啊
Ah!

729
00:41:00,063 --> 00:41:02,397
你不必如此慷慨
You didn't have to be that generous.

730
00:41:02,432 --> 00:41:06,335
是的 他是 还有...

还有...
And...

732
00:41:16,245 --> 00:41:18,947
我不知道说什么了
I don't know what to say.

733
00:41:18,981 --> 00:41:20,982
诺尔玛是个很会说话的人
Norma was the one that was good with words.

734
00:41:21,017 --> 00:41:24,919
- 那她会怎么说 - 如果你渴望什么
- What would she have said? - If you want something in life,

735
00:41:24,954 --> 00:41:27,155
就去努力争取
you got to fight for it.

736
00:41:27,189 --> 00:41:30,457
杰西卡和戴夫要搬到柏林顿去了

It's like Thanksgiving, Christmas, and my birthday...

739
00:41:42,003 --> 00:41:45,104
哈 所有节日合在一起了

740
00:41:51,578 --> 00:41:53,546
希望没人指望我
I hope none of you were expecting me

741
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,249
会请你们喝一杯
to invite you in for a drink.

742
00:41:59,252 --> 00:42:01,419
或许我们该送他条狗
Maybe we should get him a dog?

743
00:42:01,453 --> 00:42:03,621
这个男人需要的可不只是一条狗
Ha! That man needs more than a dog.

744
00:42:03,656 --> 00:42:05,623
的确是
Yes, he does.

745
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:08,393
我安排了护士每周给他做两次检查

Hey.

748

真出乎意料啊
This is unexpected.

749
00:42:24,176 --> 00:42:26,343
但愿这不是不欢迎的意思
I hope that's not code for unwelcome.

750
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,212
当然不是
Not at all.

751
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:30,514
我在你家还落了别的东西吗
Did I leave something else at your place?

752
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,515
事实上 我在想你的浴室里
Actually, I was wondering if there might be room

753
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:35,551
是否装得下我的牙刷和沐浴露
in your bathroom for my toothbrush and body wash?

754
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:39,022
我不太想来过夜时闻起来有一股麝香味儿
I kinda prefer not smelling like musky spice whenever I stay over.

755
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,857
- 我喜欢 - 你会更爱这个的
- I like it. - You'll like this better.

756
00:42:44,127 --> 00:42:48,532
# 他们在我窗前翩翩起舞 #
They were dancing In my window 

757
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:49,497
没错 我很喜欢
You're right, I do.

758
00:42:49,532 --> 00:42:53,235
# 你唤醒我对我说 #
You awoke to me and said

759
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:55,803
# 这究竟意味着什么 #
You've been wondering what it meant
