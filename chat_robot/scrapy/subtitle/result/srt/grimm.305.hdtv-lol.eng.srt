1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:08,670
SLEEP CHILD, SLEEP NOW... OR ELSE THE BOGEYMAN WILL COME AND EAT YOU.

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,260
TWO WEEKSAGO...

3
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,820
Ah, crap.

4
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,240
Get over here. Open the register.

5
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,820
No,

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,880
please. I won't talk. I won't talk.

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,330
No, you won't.

8
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,930
Come on.

9
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,430
Hell yeah.
Let's go, let's go.

10
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,580
Shocking footage of a brazen robbery at a gas station in the Jefferson district.

11
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,000
Police report it happened around 9:30 this evening.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,950
The cashier on duty has been identified as 18-year-old Andres Venegas

13
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,470
who's in critical condition at an area hospital tonight.

14
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,550
This horrific incident... Andres.

15
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,510
<i>Andres, Mijo.</i>

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,030
THEY WON'T GET AWAY EITH THIS

17
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,370
SOMEONE IS GONNA MAKE THEM PAY FOR THIS...

18
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,690
SOMEONE MUST FIND THESE TERRIBLE PEOPLE WHI DID THIS TO MY SON...

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,520
SOMEONE MUST PUNISH THEM...

20
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,120
PLEASE...

21
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,780
... DON'T LET MY GOOD BOY DIE

22
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,670
HE'S NEVER DONE ANYTHING BAD IN HIS WHOLE LIFE...

23
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,860
THE MEN WHO HAVE DINE THIS ARE EVIL...

24
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,230
Another violent robbery...

25
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,690
PLEASE HEAR ME, LISTEN TO MY TEARS...

26
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,570
LISTEN TO MY CRIES FOR JUSTICE

27
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,560
LISTEN TO THE GRIEF IN MY HEART.

28
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,010
DO NOT ALLOW THIS EVIL TO WALK THE STREETS

29
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,600
FOR THEY WILL BRING MORE TEARS TO MORE MOTHERS...

30
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,160
And there were no eyewitnesses.
The suspects have yet to be identified.

31
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,560
They remain at large.
Police consider them armed and dangerous.

32
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,480
They warn you not to approach them. If you have any information...

36
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,310
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SPEND THE MONEY

37
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,410
ROYAL ASSASSINATION CAUSING MUCH TURMOIL

38
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,760
NO LONGER SAFE

39
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,900
MUST LEAVE NOW

40
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,950
LOVE YOU, M

41
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,600
Long day, huh?
Yeah. You?

42
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,960
I read your medical reports.

43
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,270
Is there something bad?
No. Your metabolism is pretty extraordinary.

44
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,510
That's why I'm sensing something's wrong here?

45
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,850
You know what, it is none of my business.
Well, I think that means it is.

46
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,150
I shouldn't have been on your email.

47
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,070
I told you to go in my email.

48
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,110
I have nothing to hide.

49
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,240
Anymore.

50
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,730
You sure?

51
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,360
What's going on?
"Haven't been able to spend the money.

52
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,890
"Royal assassination causing much turmoil.

53
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,940
"No longer safe. Must leave now.

54
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,450
Love you. M."

55
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,210
When did this come in?
A couple of hours ago.

56
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,460
You want to tell me who "M" is and why she loves you?

57
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,430
I'm assuming it's a she.

58
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,830
Yeah.

59
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,570
Well?

60
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,820
"M" is my mother.

61
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,240
Really? Your mother? 

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,610
The one who died in the accident with your father...
she's not dead.

63
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,650
Your mother's not dead?
No, and I think she's in some kind of trouble.

64
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,080
Hold on, Nick. One thing at a time.
I'm still working on your mother being alive. HOW...

65
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,580
When did you find this out? Last year.

66
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,830
When you were in the coma, she showed up.

67
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,070
Where?
Here.

68
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,240
In the house?
Yes.

69
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,150
And in your hospital room.
She came to my hospital room?

70
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,240
Look, Juliette, there was a lot going on that night.

71
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,750
Do you remember, when you asked about the broken window, I said a bird flew into it?

72
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,800
Well, that's not exactly what happened.

73
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,370
A guy broke into the house, and he was waiting here for me. Look.

74
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,950
There's another mark up here

75
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,050
from where I took a shot at him.

76
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,890
With your gun?
Crossbow, actually, but that's beside the point.

77
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,960
I could have died if it hadn't been for my mother.

78
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,340
At first, I didn't know who it was.

79
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,550
Then she called me Nicky.

80
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,330
And I recognized her voice, and I knew it was her.

81
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,780
So-so... Wow, so...

82
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,540
so she didn't die in the accident,

83
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,140
but. A friend of hers was with my dad that night.

84
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,840
And the people who killed my parents thought it was her,

85
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,490
and she thought she was protecting me by staying out of my life.

86
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,810
You found out all this in one night?
Yeah.

87
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,530
And you were in the coma.
Not one of my better nights.

88
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,750
Why didn't you tell me till now?

89
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,940
Well, we weren't exactly together until now.

90
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,770
And...

91
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,920
Because she's like me.

92
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,580
Or I'm like her. However you want to look at it.

93
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,180
She's a Grimm?

94
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,820
It's genetic?
Yes.

95
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,120
And I didn't find that out until she showed up.

96
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,130
Imagine my surprise.

97
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,740
Why didn't she stay?

98
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,040
She had to go

99
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,970
because of some things that she did here.

100
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,240
And that message means that she's in trouble.

101
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,770
And there's nothing I can do to help her.
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,420
Is there anything that I can do?

103
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,230
No, you're doing it.

104
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,100
I'm just glad that I don't have to lie to you anymore.
Me too.

105
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,650
I wish I could have met her.

106
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,910
Did she like me?
For someone who was in a coma, yeah.

107
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,590
VIENNA, AUSTRIA

108
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,160
THAT'S YOUR BABY'S HEARTBEAT...

109
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,360
... SOUNDS HEALTHY AND NORMAL

110
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,510
CAN YOU TELL WHEN I'M DUE?

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,370
SPRINGTIME

112
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,300
HOW'S YOUR MORING SICKNESS?

113
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,560
GONE, I HOPE

114
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:13,670
BE SMART, EAT RIGHT...

115
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,920
... MODERATE EXERCISE AND -

116
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,360
WHAT'S WRONG?

117
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,910
ITT SOUNDS LIKE A SECOND HEARTBEAT

118
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,220
I'M ... HAVING TWINS?

119
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,950
<i>Nein.</i>

120
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,340
NOT THAT I CAN SEE

121
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,440
IT MIGHT JUST BE AN ECHO

122
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,800
THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT

123
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,460
BUT COME BCK AND SEE ME IN TWO WEEKS

124
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,520
SHE WAS EXAMINED BY DOCTOR HAWELKA. AN OBSTERTRICIAN

125
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,340
YOU'LL NEED TO ACCESS HER MEDICAL RECORDS

126
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,000
WHEN?

127
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,280
ASAP

128
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,110
BUT YOU'LL NEED TO BE DISREET

129
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,380
NOT LIKE LAST TIME, THEN

130
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,980
GOOD TO HAVE A CHANGE OF PACE

131
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,250
- No bag. - No bag.

132
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,900
- Have a nice day. - <i>Gracias.</i>

133
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,920
Thanks.

134
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,030
- Let's do it. - <i>Vamos.</i>

135
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,470
Everybody down.

136
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,960
Get on the ground.

137
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,720
Get down!

138
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,000
Okay.

139
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,330
Come on! V!

140
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,190
<i>Vamanos.</i>

141
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,000
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

142
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,070
Come on.

143
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,990
No! No! No! No!

144
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,260
No!

145
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,660
Oh, God! Oh, no, please. Oh, God.

146
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,780
Hey fellas.

147
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,350
Well, it could have been a good night, but we got two dead bodies.

148
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,740
One here, one down by a parked car.

149
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,760
Killer went for the throat.

150
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,500
It was pretty bloody.

151
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,830
No wallet.

152
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,450
Neighbor who heard the screams called it in.
Where's the neighbor?

153
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,800
He's in the back of my car. Name's Martinez.

154
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,450
He's pretty shook up. I thought he was gonna get sick.

155
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,160
And to tell you the truth, I don't blame him.
Anybody else hear this?

156
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,330
He's the only one willing to talk.

157
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,340
All right, let's get some prints.

158
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,330
Mr. Martinez?
We're Detectives Burkhardt and Griffin.

159
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,880
We understand you witnessed the attack.
No, I only heard it.

160
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,720
Can you describe what you heard?
It was horrible, like they were being torn apart by dogs.

161
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,650
How long after you heard it did you come outside?
Couple of minutes.

162
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,250
I just put on some sweats, came out, and saw what happened.

163
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,050
You see anybody running from the area?
No.

164
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,790
You worried about something?

165
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,960
Actually, I don't know what I heard.

166
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,700
Can I go?
I really didn't see anything. I just called 911.

167
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,860
We may need to contact you later, but, yes, you're free to go.

168
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:40,930
He's scared.

169
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,140
Yeah, well, he just saw a guy with his throat ripped out.

170
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,710
Bound to give you some indigestion.

171
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,120
Let's go check out the car.

172
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,580
Got two wallets.

173
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,200
Eddie Otero.
Guessin' that's Eddie.

174
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,000
Alfredo guzman.
Sort of looks like what's left of the other guy.

175
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,350
Why put your wallet in the glove box?

176
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,970
I got something back here.

177
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,340
Two masks.

178
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,150
Two 9 millimeters.

179
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,810
A bag...

180
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,600
Full of money.

181
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,900
I'm going out on a limb here and say these boys were up to no good.

182
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,420
- So what took them down? - And left the money?

183
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,610
Well, maybe the killer didn't know about the money.

184
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,180
Or got run off before he could come back for it.

185
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,610
Wesen?

186
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,300
Wesen like money just as much as anyone else.

187
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,840
Feral dogs?
Well, here's something interesting.

188
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,780
Call just came through.
Convenience store around the corner was hit.

189
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,120
Look, more cops.
You see what's going on here, right?

190
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,100
I mean, you see it?

191
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,030
Criminals are taking over the neighborhood and what the hell are you doing about it?

192
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,940
Nothing.

193
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,160
- Who's this guy? - David Florez. Local hothead.

194
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,920
Whenever we show up, he shows up to tell us how badly we're screwing up.

195
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,860
- So crime's our fault? - Seems to be.

196
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,840
Typical stop and rob.

197
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,580
Two guys came in waving guns, emptied the register.

198
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,610
They wore masks so we're not getting much in the way of a description.

199
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,500
I think we already got them.
Wait, what? How?

200
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,230
We got two bodies around the corner.

201
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,820
Guns, masks, and a bag of money.

202
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,190
Somebody killed 'em?

203
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,700
And left the money behind?
If they're our guys.

204
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,760
- Who did it? - Don't know.

205
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,650
It's what we call "a mystery."
Oh, that's what that is.

206
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,110
Security cams up?
System's in back.

207
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,950
Back it up a few minutes before.
Somebody might have seen 'em on the street before they came in.

208
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,950
This guy left 2 and 1/2 minutes before the robbery.

209
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:56,410
That'd put him in the witness ballpark.
Let's see who's next.

210
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,040
She might have seen them.
Anybody else?

211
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,570
If this guy left just before they came in he might have seen them go in, come out...

212
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,430
or what happened to them.
See if we can I.D. these three.

213
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,450
- Bring 'em in. - Yeah. Will do.

214
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,190
TRACK IP ADDRESS

215
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,140
LOCATION: VISNJA GORA

216
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,610
Where the hell is Visnja Gora?

217
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,140
I didn't see anybody after I left the store.

218
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,180
No dogs either.
I drove right home.

219
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,310
I heard what happened as soon as I got back to my apartment.

220
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,240
It's terrible.
I was hoping this neighborhood would be safer.

221
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,630
I'm afraid I didn't see anything.
At least not that I can remember.

222
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,680
I wish I could be more helpful.
As soon as I left the store I got on a bus and headed home.

223
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,490
- What bus did you take? - The 72.

224
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,430
How far was the bus stop from the store?
It's just down the street.

225
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,260
And did you see anything?

226
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,810
I'm sorry. No.

227
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:06,070
I had to run for the bus.
So you live in the neighborhood and you took the bus.

228
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,240
Yeah.
It's only one stop, but I had groceries.

229
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,450
Did you see any loose dogs on the street?

230
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,270
No.

231
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,790
There are a lot of kids in the neighborhood and we've got two dead men.

232
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,460
If there are any dangerous animals running around,
you should help us do something about it.

233
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,720
There's this one guy, ray Bolton.

234
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,900
He has dogs.
I heard he fights 'em on weekends.

235
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,450
I know they get out sometimes. But, look, this guy is...

236
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,680
You can't be saying I told you.
We won't.

237
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,310
I thought you'd be asleep.
I can't sleep.

238
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,940
Not with all that's going on.
What's going on?

239
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,350
Look what I found.

240
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,870
Visnja Gora.
It's in Slovenia.

241
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,740
Right in the middle.
And we care about that because?

242
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,360
Because that is where your mom's email was sent from.

243
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,250
I mean, she said she was in danger, so I thought I'd better look into where it came from,

244
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,700
so I tracked the IP address of the server it was sent from.

245
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,830
I wish I could track down the actual address she sent it from,

246
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:21,400
but for that I would need access to the ISP, which, you know, I obviously don't have.

247
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,460
So she's in Slovenia?

248
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,420
Or was when she sent the email.
What kind of trouble is she in?

249
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,390
She's a Grimm. A lot of people want her dead.

250
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,410
She's on her way to Greece, and she's out there all alone.

251
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,760
What you got there?
Ray Bolton.

252
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,410
- The guy with the dogs? - Yeah.

253
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,980
Professional bad guy.

254
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,770
Convictions for assault, narcotics distribution, and illegal firearms.

255
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,610
That's a nice way to start the morning.
Oh, it gets better.

256
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,710
Our two dead guys, guzman and Otero, are known associates of Bolton.

257
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,920
Are we thinking he killed them?
Got motive.

258
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,200
Guzman testified against him on a narcotics charge last year.

259
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,280
Could have turned his dogs on them and got Otero too.

260
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,450
Guess we'd better check 'em out.

261
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,410
Let's get animal control to meet us out there in case Bolton's dogs killed those guys.

262
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,070
- Who are you? - Ray Bolton.

263
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,980
We're investigating a possible murder.
We need to check out your dogs.

264
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,320
My dogs didn't do nothing.

265
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,080
The two victims were old pals of yours, Eddie Otero and Alfredo guzman.

266
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,110
We have reason to believe they were killed by dogs.
And they need to be swabbed.

267
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,490
Hey, you ain't takin' my dogs.

268
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,740
Yes, we are. And if they weren't involved you get 'em back.

269
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,200
I said you ain't takin' my dogs. Get your hands off of me!

270
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,330
Grimm. You're not takin' my dogs!

271
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,790
We're taking your dogs and we're taking you.

272
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:58,470
Hell yeah. Hell yeah! It's about time you got this trash off the street.

273
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,160
- Him again? - Called you 100 times about this dude.

274
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,570
Stay back, sir.
That's right, lock his ass up.

275
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,790
You keep talking, bro.
Keep talkin'.

276
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,470
Now what?

277
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,130
- Rosalee, can you get that? - Got it.

278
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,090
Thanks.

279
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,240
I'll probably be home a little late tonight. I'm expecting a delivery.

280
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,600
Hello?

281
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,390
Hello?

282
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:31,100
Oh, I think I have the wrong number.
Are you looking for Monroe?

283
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,180
Oh, yes.
May I say who's calling?

284
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,490
His mother.

285
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,280
It's your mother. Does she know that we're...

286
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,570
no.

287
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,230
Not yet.

288
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,620
Let me talk to her.

289
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,270
Hey, mom. How are you?

290
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,450
I don't suppose that was the cleaning lady who answered the phone.

291
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,470
No, mom, that was Rosalee.
She's my girlfriend.

292
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:05,300
Oh, you've got a girlfriend.
When did that happen?

293
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,830
A while ago.
Well, you sound kind of busy.

294
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,670
Call us back when you have a chance.
Yeah.

295
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,240
That's a good idea.

296
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,560
Okay, love you.
We love you too.

297
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,950
I guess we should probably tell our parents what we're doing.

298
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,730
Now that we're doing it, yeah.

299
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,950
I mean, we're grown people. We're adults.

300
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,560
So when do you think we should...

301
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,880
- later. - Right.

302
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,920
Okay.

303
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,080
Bye.
bye

304
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,890
He knows what you are.

305
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,590
- What's he? - I'm not sure.

306
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,630
Looked sort of like a Hundjager mixed up with a Daemonfeuer.

307
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,980
I have no idea what you're talking about, but he could be our guy.

308
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,950
He didn't seem too bothered about me being a Grimm.
Wait till he gets to know you better.

309
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,790
You got no right to do this to me.
What? Didn't he attack an officer of the law?

310
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,260
I remember something like that.
Anything happens to my dog...

311
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,610
shut up.

312
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,910
Only thing we wanna hear from you is why you killed guzman and Otero.

313
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,260
- I had nothing to do with that. - No?

314
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,620
Guzman testifies against you, you got no problem with that?
That case got thrown out.

315
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,480
And you don't hold grudges.
You're such a forgiving guy.

316
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,480
People always get what's coming to 'em.

317
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,140
You sic your dogs on him, or did you rip 'em up yourself?

318
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,040
Yeah, that's right.

319
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,030
My dogs could have done it or I could have done it, but we didn't.

320
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,710
I was at home with my lady, nowhere near those fools.

321
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:33,530
Swab my dogs all you want, 'cause you got nothing.
I'm gonna Sue your dumb asses.

322
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,660
We got motive.
Yeah, but no evidence to tie him to it.

323
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,650
If the girlfriend corroborates... and she will... we won't get a warrant.

324
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,050
Got your report from animal control.
Don't think you're gonna like it.

325
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:54,660
Hair and saliva from Bolton's dogs don't match what they found on the bodies.

326
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,280
They'd like to take the dogs back, but you got the owner locked up.

327
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,460
What do you want me to tell 'em?

328
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,370
Tell them the owner assaulted a police officer and we're going to keep him for a while.

329
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,800
They should do the same with the dogs.
Copy that.

330
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,560
okay, If Bolton is what I saw,

331
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,060
then he's more than capable of killing those guys the way that they were killed.

332
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,140
Then he wouldn't have needed his dogs, but the dogs were good cover.

333
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,740
We look at the dogs and not him. We should be swabbing him.

334
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,940
Even if that comes up positive, how do we explain how he did what he did?

335
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,310
Let's swab the son of a bitch anyway.
I want him to know that we know.

336
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,470
I wanna know what we're dealing with.

337
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,560
No dog did this.
How can you tell?

338
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,840
Usually when a dog or coyote or wolf bites down in attack it'll shake the victim

339
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,420
and you'd see more tearing in the wounds.

340
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,520
- Who wants more caprese? - Me.

341
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,720
Definitely not a Blutbad.
Fyi, too much general mangling.

342
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,140
We're more of a throat first and ask questions later wesen.

343
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,690
Plus...

344
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,210
yeah, there's no signs of going after the legs first to cripple the prey.

345
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,090
Sorry. Victim.

346
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,820
Which is what a canine would do,
so, yeah, you're probably dealing with a wesen and powerful.

347
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,900
You don't know what kind of wesen you're dealing with?

348
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,710
A sort of part Hundjager, part Daemonfeuer.

349
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,800
- That sounds like a... - Hollentier.

350
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,290
Exactly what I was thinking.

351
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:21,180
Bigish eyes, snoutyish, brutish, neanderthalesque.

352
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,650
- Basically a jerkwad. - That's him.

353
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,320
Because a hollentier could definitely do that.

354
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,300
What does "hollentier" mean? Is it German?

355
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,110
Basically, it means "beast from hell."

356
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,270
They actually have a really ancient lineage all the way back to the Egyptians.

357
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,890
How did he react to you?

358
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,920
He didn't seem to care all that much.

359
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,910
Definitely a hollentier then.

360
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,470
This wesen wasn't afraid of you?
He didn't appear to be.

361
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,370
Your basic hollentier is too stupid to know what to be afraid of.

362
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,180
Which is why the Egyptians used to entomb them with their pharaohs.

363
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,600
They thought it was a promotion until, you know, they buried 'em alive.

364
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,100
Can somebody pass the, um, what do you call it?

365
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,510
The artichokes or the Edamame Tabouleh?

366
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,170
Both?

367
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,710
So where is this hollentier now?

368
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,050
Uh, we've got him locked up.

369
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,510
you put a pharaoh in there with him he'll stay forever.

370
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,160
Just sayin'.

371
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,480
Stop!

372
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,940
Stop! Quit fighting!

373
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,900
So the guy drags the woman here to assault her, then gets annihilated.

374
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,840
And Bolton's locked up.
It wasn't him. We have to let him go.

375
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,620
Can't say I'm happy about that.

376
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,030
Now we got three vics in the same neighborhood.

377
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:03,620
All bad guys.
Seems like we got a vigilante on our hands.

378
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,930
Vigilante wesen.

379
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,780
Would the witness have seen him?
Possibly.

380
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,180
But even if she did, she wouldn't know what she saw.

381
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,170
Don't I know it.
EMTs are through treating Miss Ramos.

382
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,910
She's pretty shook up.
She's got more to say.

383
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,090
Florez is back.

384
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,860
Not again.

385
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,230
Is he doggin' us or does he get here before we do?

386
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,100
We should run him and make sure.
Yeah.

387
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,180
I'm Detective Burkhardt and this is Detective Griffin.

388
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,550
- You Miss Ramos? - Yes.

389
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,130
Do you feel up to answering a few questions?

390
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,020
I can.

391
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,820
Did you know the man who attacked you?

392
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,660
- No.

393
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,590
- Had you ever seen him before?
No.

394
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,870
Can you tell us what you saw after you got off the bus?

395
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,160
I walked down the street.

396
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,120
I heard someone following me and I turned to look,

397
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,290
but he turned away and went down another street.

398
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,000
I thought I was being paranoid.

399
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,370
That's when he attacked me.

400
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,120
I tried to scream, but he hit me...

401
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,800
And knocked me down and was going to...

402
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,840
I don't know what happened next.

403
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,400
I'm sorry.

404
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,770
It was horrible.

405
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,650
Horrible.

406
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,550
Can you describe who killed the man that attacked you?

407
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,400
Just try to tell us what you saw.

408
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,200
El Cucuy.

409
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,340
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

410
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,790
El Cucuy.

411
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,410
Is that a name?

412
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,320
Do you know this El Cucuy?

413
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,280
We all do.

414
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,600
We know what El Cucuy is?
Not a clue.

415
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,740
She said everybody knows it.
Everybody except us.

416
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,170
Gotta be Spanish, right?
Sounds like.

417
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,870
Juliette?
Think so.

418
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,720
Now you see that?

419
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,900
Somebody doing your job. Hey.

420
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,410
- Cleaning up the streets. - Hey! Hey, that's enough. Move on.

421
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:44,570
Time to go home.
Mr. Florez is starting to get on my nerves.

422
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,540
El Cucuy.
Ever heard of it?

423
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,730
Yeah, actually.
It's like the boogeyman.

424
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,630
A bunch of different names for it in Spanish.

425
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:02,510
My grandma used to call it "El Coco," and whenever I was bad, like I wouldn't go to bed,

426
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,310
she would say it was gonna come and get me or if I didn't make the bed,

427
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:10,050
it would be hiding under the bed waiting for me, or if I didn't eat my vegetables.

428
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,330
You get the picture.
You mean it's not real?

429
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,950
Well, when you're a little kid, everything's real.

430
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,490
Why, who told you about El Cucuy?

431
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,440
The victim.

432
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,960
She said El Cucuy killed the man that attacked her.

433
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,230
She said it was El Cucuy?

434
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,580
So, what, are you thinking it's wesen?

435
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,890
We don't know what we're thinking.

436
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,720
There's actually somebody who might know.

437
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,370
IS'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU, MY DEAR. PLEASE COME IN

438
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,520
I'M GLAD THINGS HAV WORKED OUT FOR YOU

439
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,050
THANK YOU, PLIAR. ME TOO

440
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,720
THIS IS NICK, HE'S--

441
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,520
I know who he is.

442
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:56,250
You are interested in El Cucuy.

443
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,190
Yeah, a woman was attacked by a man that was killed.

444
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,760
And she says it was El Cucuy that saved her life.

445
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,800
I COULD SENSE IT ...

446
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,850
YOU COULD SENSE WHAT?

447
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,540
I could sense it was coming.

448
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,630
Please sit.

449
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:20,160
When I was a child in Guadalajara,

450
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,970
there was a time of great sorrow.

451
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,100
No one was safe.

452
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,670
The people of my neighborhood were being terrorized.

453
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,270
I was so scared
I would sleep under the bed of my parents.

454
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,660
Then one night,

455
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,770
I heard the woman next door calling,

456
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,610
"El Cucuy... El Cucuy."

457
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,960
Her husband had been killed that day.

458
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,820
And I heard another woman calling,

459
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,670
"El Cucuy, El Cucuy,

460
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,310
come and save us from this evil."

461
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,660
One house to the other,

462
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,170
night after night, calling for help...

463
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,090
And just when I thought it would never get better,

464
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,450
one of the evil men was dead on our street.

465
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,870
And then another was dead on another street.

466
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,070
And then a third,

467
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:17,260
torn up like they had been attacked by wild dogs,

468
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,850
until no evil men were left in our barrio.

469
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,110
Have you ever seen El Cucuy?
No.

470
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,600
But one of the women on my street did.

471
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,390
We asked her what El Cucuy looked like.

472
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,330
She said its eyes glowed yellow,

473
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,980
its teeth were sharp like razors,

474
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,490
and its breath was foul like something who had eaten the dead.

475
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:47,990
And it could hear the cries of those in sorrow.

476
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,040
So you believe.

477
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:58,620
I believe El Cucuy wanders from place to place.

478
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,840
And it waits until it is called by voices of women who have suffered from evil.

479
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,680
If enough voices cry out,

480
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,060
they become one voice that cannot be ignored.

481
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,170
Then it wakes and hunts.

482
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:20,620
If El Cucuy is here, it is to answer that call.

483
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,570
I got nothing.

484
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,300
You find anything? Lots.

485
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,450
This one is about a Grimm who tracked down

486
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:42,310
and beheaded an entire family of Faeteo Fatalis in...

487
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,020
whoa, in 1655,

488
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,760
who were wreaking havoc in Vlatos on the island of crete.

489
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:54,410
But no. I haven't found anything that looks or sounds like El Cucuy.

490
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,240
It's a big world, maybe this is just one they haven't encountered yet.

491
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,940
Or maybe it's in a book that was never handed down to my relatives.

492
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,630
Who knows how much is still out there?

493
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,730
Maybe it isn't even wesen.

494
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,850
Well, look at you, just walking the streets like you own them.

495
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,220
This is not your neighborhood. It's mine.

496
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,100
Disrespect me again, and they'll never find you...

497
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,020
Or your mother.

498
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,600
You see something?

499
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,300
Take care of this, Paul.

500
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,030
You got a positive on our attacker from last night... Stephen Stillman.

501
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,740
Last known address, Vancouver, Washington.

502
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,020
Any link between him, Otero, guzman, or Bolton? None.

503
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,650
What about this Florez who keeps showing up - at the crime scenes? - Florez lives with his mother.

504
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,560
A couple domestic disturbance calls.

505
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,520
He's a marine, did three tours in Afghanistan, diagnosed with PTSD.

506
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,940
This marine comes back from the war, suffering from PTSD,

507
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,880
finds crime on the rise in his neighborhood, decides to do something about it.

508
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,240
Kind of makes sense. We think he's our guy?

509
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,160
It could be. We're still working it.

510
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,550
Surveillance footage from the bus last night just came in... any takers?

511
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,830
Yeah. Put it up.

512
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,430
This is from the 75 bus last night.

513
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,130
That's the victim, Ms. Ramos.

514
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,880
That's Stillman, the guy that attacked her.

515
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,220
And the guy in front of him is the one she thought was following her.

516
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,760
But he turned down another street.

517
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,910
Well, he might have seen something, but he didn't come forward.

518
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,700
And we might want to think about talking to... Hey.

519
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:19,240
Don't we know her?
Yeah, she was at the convenience store robbery.

520
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,710
We brought her in for questioning.
Mrs. Garcia, right?

521
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:25,180
Same woman at two crime scenes?
In the same area apparently.

522
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,680
I think you need to talk to her again.

523
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,390
David, what's wrong?
They let him out!

524
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,190
Who?
The police! They let him out!

525
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,020
What are you talking about?
Open the door.

526
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,310
<i>Mijo,</i> open this door!

527
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,680
David!

528
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,440
If the police are too scared to take care of him...
<i>Mijo,</i>open this door!

529
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,520
Then I will.

530
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:55,040
David! Open this door! David, open this door!

531
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,310
***

532
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,410
Who is it?
It's the police, Mrs. Garcia.</i>

533
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:06,830
Detectives Burkhardt and Griffin.
We spoke with you the other night?

534
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,630
Oh, yes. I remember.

535
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:14,890
I-I'm always a little nervous about opening my door after dark.

536
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:17,560
Would you like to come in?
I can make you some tea.

537
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,210
Actually, we'd like you to come down to the precinct with us.

538
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,100
Have I done something wrong?
No, ma'am.

539
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,490
You were on the 75 bus last night.
Yes, I was.

540
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:33,360
How did you know?
There are surveillance cameras on the buses.

541
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,510
Can... can I ask you what this is about?

542
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,920
We'd rather ask you a few questions at the precinct.
There's some photos we'd like you to look at.

543
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,380
Oh, yes.
Well, of course, if you need me to.

544
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,220
I'll just get my coat.

545
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,030
I gotta tell you, Nick, I don't think she's gonna be much help.

546
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,790
I hope you don't mind,

547
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:08,040
but I don't get many handsome young men visitors anymore.

548
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,740
Oh. This is a nice car.

549
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,440
I bet it's fast.
When it has to be.

550
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,570
Burkhardt.
Call just came in from David Florez's mother.

551
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:15,810
She's really upset.
Said he came home furious that we let Bolton go.

552
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,490
I'm assuming that means he's going to Bolton's house to confront him.

553
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,650
How do you want to handle this?

554
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:22,050
Meet us there. We can try to intercept him.

555
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:26,830
We got a problem with Florez.
Apparently he's pretty upset that we let Bolton go.

556
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:30,460
Mom called it in, thinks he might be going after Bolton.
- Then we better go.

557
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,420
Sorry, Mrs. Garcia. But we're gonna have to make a detour.

558
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,680
Oh, no problem. Whatever you need to do.

559
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,070
It sounds very exciting.

560
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,100
Open the door!

561
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,230
I have come to disrespect you and everything you stand for.

562
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,020
You are going to leave this place or I'm gonna make you leave!

563
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,950
This is not your neighborhood!

564
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,190
You do not belong here!
This fool's gonna bring the police.

565
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,280
Get this stuff outta here.
I'll take care of him.

566
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,820
Open the door!

567
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,450
What, you didn't get enough the first time?

568
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:27,290
Stop! Police!

569
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,770
Hey, he came on my property with that knife.
This is self-defense. 

570
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,570
Get back in your house. Arrest him. 

571
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,210
I'm pressing charges, man. He tried to kill me!

572
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,060
Get in the house or we'll arrest you.

573
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,260
Let's call an ambulance.
Let's get him into the car.

574
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,630
You shouldn't have let him go, man.

575
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,040
Shouldn't have let him go.
Where is she?

576
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,360
- She's not here. - Where'd she go?

577
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,760
Dumbass cops, got nothin' on me.
I told you guys to get out of here.

578
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,380
Stay with him!

579
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,930
Back away.

580
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,210
Ay, chihuahua.
You're a Grimm.

581
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,190
I had no idea.

582
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,710
You're 77 years old.
Last month.

583
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,810
You killed guzman and Otero.

584
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,290
And Stillman, who attacked Ms. Ramos under the bridge.

585
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,500
I know it looks bad, 

586
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:54,500
but do you really think anyone is going to believe that I could do such things?

587
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,410
You're El Cucuy.
I've been called many things.

588
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:01,770
You have Bolton's blood all over you.
Well, yes, you brought me to Mr. Bolton's house.

589
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:05,770
And I heard the terrible screaming, I went in to help.

590
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:10,030
Oh, I must have gotten all bloody when I tried to save him.

591
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,180
"Save him"? Really?

592
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:15,700
Oh, you don't need to worry about me anymore.
I have done what I came to do.

593
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,200
The neighborhood is safe again.
And I-I really should be moving on.

594
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,850
You really think we can just let you go?

595
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,970
Well, I don't think you have any choice.

596
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,840
Are you kidding me?

597
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,470
They are evil.

598
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,140
FIND THEM... FIND THEM...

599
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,970
?????? El Cucuy...

600
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:03,340
You must help us. El Cucuy...

601
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,460
