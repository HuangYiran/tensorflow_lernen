00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,380
《星际之门亚特兰蒂斯》  前情回顾
Previously on Stargate Atlantis...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,590
我确定昨晚我看到了一个梦境
I believe I had a vision last night.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,840
我见到了我儿子的父亲  迦楠
I saw Kanaan, the father of my son.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,630
-救救我们  -你在哪里
- Save us. - Where are you?

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,690
幽灵战斗机!
Dart!

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,680
正如你所请求  我为你而来
I came for you, just like you asked.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,560
是我要求的
Like I asked.

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,640
-迈克尔  -在你梦境中的人是我
- Michael. - I was the one in your visions.

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,030
我被及时地送回来了?
I was sent back in time?

10
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,230
不  事实上你被提早送回来了
No, in fact, you were sent forward.

11
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,910
你失踪后
I've loaded all the intel

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,510
有关迈克尔的情报已经被全部载入了
we got on Michael after your disappearance,

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,730
包括我们找到泰勒的地方
including the address where we found Teyla.

14
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,170
快
Quickly.

15
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,740
-你必须放了我  -泰勒
- You must release me. - Teyla.

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,800
-约翰  -我知道泰勒的下落了
- John. - I know where Teyla is.

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,710
我的孩子不关你的事
My child is of no concern to you.

18
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,710
我为他计划好了未来
I have great plans for him.

19
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,790
我想我们来得太早了
I think we're too early,

20
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,790
但他会把她带到这里分娩
but he'll bring her here to have the baby.

21
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,210
这是个陷阱  我们必须马上离开这里!
Colonel, it's a boobytrap. We must get outta here, now!

22
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:04,700
太完美了
This is perfect.

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,020
正是我所要的
Just what I needed.

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,610
为刚忙完的几个星期干杯
To the has been hectic several weeks.

25
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,500
怎么不说是四年
Try four years.

26
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,410
说的没错
Very true.

27
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,490
你看  它使这平凡的一刻更加与众不同
You know what, it makes these common moments even more special.

28
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,830
我很珍惜我们两人在一起的时光
I cherish these times, when it's just you and me.

29
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:24,940
我也是
Me too.

30
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,710
你明天还要早起
You... you've got an early morning.

31
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,590
我从来没好好的谢过你
I never got to properly thank you.

32
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,510
为什么
For what?

33
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,180
什么为什么
For what?

34
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,770
为你救了我
For rescuing me.

35
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,770
从迈克尔手里
From Michael.

36
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,110
我从没放弃希望  因为我知道
I never gave up hope because I knew...

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,070
我知道约翰你会回来救我的
I knew that you would come for me, John.

38
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,290
这听起来很荒唐  但...
I know this sounds crazy, but...

39
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,160
我不记得
I don't remember...

40
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,480
曾救过你
rescuing you.

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
你不记得是因为你确实没有救过她
You don't remember rescuing her because you didn't.

42
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,130
就像你从来没救过我
Just like you never rescued me.

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,250
谢帕德
Sheppard!

44
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,140
老兄
Hey, buddy.

45
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,970
-发生什么了  -迈克尔的场子塌了
- What happened? - Michael's compound collapsed on us.

46
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,270
我想我...
I think I... I...

47
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,910
坚持住  让我来瞧瞧
Yeah, hold on. Let me take a look.

48
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,920
那是什么鬼东西
What the hell was that?

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,840
一个旧碎片  没什么大不了的
Just old scrap, no big deal.

50
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,440
其他人怎么样了
What about the others?

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,980
我不清楚  我们被分开了
I don't know. We got separated.

52
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,620
试试用无线电联系他们
Try them on the radio.

53
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,590
没信号  这儿干扰太多
Still no signal. There's too much interference.

54
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,780
我的腿一定是断了
Pretty sure my leg is broken.

55
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,670
我想我的情况倒还不错
I think I'm remarkably fine.

56
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,490
那不是很好吗
Isn't that wonderful?

57
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,370
让我舒了一口气  谢谢
That brings me great comfort, thank you.

58
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,150
我想我们埋得不是很深  能看见阳光
I don't think we're that deep. I can see daylight.

59
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,190
如果我能...
If I can just...

60
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,670
-道歉  - 我让埃迪生守在入口处了
- Sorry. - I posted Edison at the entrance.

61
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,220
他会去找支援的
He'll get help.

62
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,100
如果他没被碎片砸到的话
That is assuming he wasn't hit by falling debris.

63
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,210
博士
Doc,

64
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,830
代达罗斯号离开亚特兰蒂斯时
The Dedalus left Atlantis

65
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,430
我们是在确认谢帕德所讲的故事
when we were still confirming Sheppard's story.

66
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,500
那样算起来
With that kind of a headstart,

67
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,090
他们应该会在三小时内到达这里
they should be here in less than three hours.

68
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,820
所以不管怎么说  救援队一定在路上了
So one way or the other, help is on the way.

69
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,480
抱歉  只是空间狭小使我不舒服
I'm sorry. It's just I'm not good in tight spaces.

70
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,230
这里没有敌人  好不?
Look, there's no bad guys around, okay?

71
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,540
没坏人  只有一大片的废墟  所以...
No bad guys, just a lot of debris. So...

72
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,410
如果你给我坐好了别乱动
if you could please just sit tight

73
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,490
不要让上面的废墟掉下来  就万幸了
and try not to make the ceiling collapse, that would be great.

74
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,090
好的  没坏人
Okay. No bad guys.

75
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,360
坐着不动
Just... just sit tight.

76
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,240
-你什么时候得到这个的  -几个月前
- When did you get this? - Moments ago.

77
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,390
计划有变
Change of plans.

78
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,400
设定新航线
We're setting a new course.

79
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,310
我们的场子已经失守了
Our compound has been compromised.

80
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,730
外来临时激活
Unscheduled off-world activation.

81
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,380
是中尉埃迪生的虹膜解除码
It's lieutenant Edison's IDC.

82
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,220
发生了什么  你的同伴呢
What happened? Where's your team?

83
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,220
发生了一个大爆炸
There was a massive explosion.

84
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,240
所有人都在那个主场里时
Everyone was in the main compound,

85
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
整个场子就突然崩塌了
the whole building imploded on itself.

86
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,320
-有生还者吗  -无线电通讯设备失效了
- Were there any survivors? - Radios are down.

87
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,660
不知道  我只想要先回来报告
I don't know. I just thought I should get back here.

88
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,230
不  你做得很好  把他带去医务室
No, you did the right thing. Get him to the infirmary.

89
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,910
-代达罗斯号还有多远  -还有两小时
- How far away is the Daedalus? - Still two hours out.

90
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,230
我们不能再等了
We can't wait that long.

91
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,350
让工程兵集合起来
Have the combat engineers gear up

92
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,350
让凯勒医生准备出发
and Doctor Keller ready her away team.

93
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,520
是的  长官
Yes, ma'am.

94
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,890
-你在干什么  -我有幽闭恐惧症
- What are you doing? - I'm claustrophobic.

95
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,310
我正忙着集中注意力  这很不容易
I'm trying to keep my mind busy, which is hard,

96
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,310
因为你知道这...
because you know, it's...

97
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,510
是我的注意力
my mind.

98
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,890
大爆炸后不可能留下什么有用的东西
Well, there's no way anything useful survived that implosion.

99
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,140
说你自己吧
Speak for yourself.

100
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,780
博士  你知道我是什么意思
You know what I mean, Doc.

101
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,410
我找到了一堆电脑部件
I found a bunch of computer parts.

102
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,390
主板不是烧焦就是绷断
The mother boards are all fried or snapped.

103
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,600
而这些硬件可能完好无损
But these hard drives might still be intact.

104
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,680
如果我能接通电源...
If I can just get the power to...

105
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,420
怎么了  有什么好消息
What is it? Something good?

106
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
不知道  一下子出来很多信息
I don't know, a lot of information.

107
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,450
等等
Hold on.

108
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,700
我想我中六合彩了
I think I just hit the jackpot.

109
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,910
有办法发出信号了?
Some way to broadcast a signal?

110
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,300
让他们知道我们的位置
Let people know our location,

111
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,300
好快点来救我  还是什么
speed up the rescue? What?

112
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,830
不  虽是事后诸葛亮  不过你是对的
No, although in hindsight, you're right,

113
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,330
那真等于中头奖了
that should be considered the jackpot.

114
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,920
这只是个硬件  只能读取它上面的信息
But, no, this is a hardrive, I can only access what's on it.

115
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,380
什么信息
Which is?

116
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,840
是爆炸中保存下来的迈克尔的日志
It's Michael's wiki. It survived the explosion.

117
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,600
-那是什么  -迈克尔的数据库
- The what? - Michael's database.

118
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,830
里面有大量甚至所有的资料
A large chunk, maybe the whole thing.

119
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,370
我是说我们得到了基本简图
I mean we've got base schematics,

120
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,810
医疗研究资料  行星列表...
medical research information, list of planets...

121
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,890
-你知道这意味着什么吗  -是啊
- I mean, you know what this means? - Yeah.

122
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,540
意味着我们仍困在这里  外加断条腿
It means we're still stuck here and I still have a broken leg.

123
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,560
那只是暂时的  但如果我们能离开这
In the short term. But if we get out of here...

124
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,380
如果?
If?

125
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,410
他还在外面  会找人来的  如果迈克尔...
We'd have him on the run, he'd be finished. Look, if Michael...

126
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,620
不好
Oh no.

127
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,700
什么
What?

128
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,430
鉴于你现在伤势
I don't want to concern you any more

129
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,930
我不想雪上加霜
than you actually already are,

130
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,140
如果我没看错的话  那么迈克尔他...
but if I'm reading this correctly, then Michael is...

131
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,100
-闭嘴  -你闭嘴  这很重要
- Shut up. - You shut up. This is important.

132
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,840
-如果迈克尔是...  -别出声
- If Michael is... - Quit making noise.

133
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,130
有脚步声
It's footsteps.

134
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,270
好吧  改变计划  快大声叫啊
Okay, revise that. Start making noise.

135
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,330
在下面!
Down here!

136
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,380
-我们在下面  -快来救救我们!
- We're down here! - Help!

137
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,110
检测到四个生命迹象  分别在两个地方
All right, we've got four life signs in two different locations.

138
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,240
有两个人就在我们正下方
First two should be right beneath us.

139
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,480
-听  -我们在下面
- Listen! - We're down here!

140
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,030
麦凯  是你吗
McKay, is that you?

141
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,500
谢天谢地  是的
Oh, thank God. Yes!

142
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,540
-我和罗恩被困在底下了  -你们还好吧
- I'm trapped down here with Lorne. - Are you okay?

143
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,690
-我们很好  -博士  你在说什么!
- Were fine! - Hey Doc!

144
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,720
对了  罗恩的腿断了
Right, right, right. Okay, Lorne's got a broken leg.

145
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,840
呆着别动  我们有工程兵在这
Stay put. We've got combat engineers here.

146
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,140
我们会把你们救出来的
We're going to dig you out.

147
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,350
快点
Hurry up!

148
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,810
罗德尼  安全的前提下我们会尽量快的
We work as fast as is safe, Rodney.

149
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,680
不  你们不明白
No, you don't understand.

150
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,180
我发现自毁程序一旦启动
I found out that when the selfdestruct is initiated,

151
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,950
就会自动引爆亚空间
it's automatically programmed to send a subspace burst.

152
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,190
迈克尔很可能已经在路上了
Michael's probably already on his way.

153
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,100
看起来他们并不是陷得太深
It doesn't look like they're too far down.

154
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,240
一个小时内应该可以把他们救出来
We should be able to get them out inside of an hour.

155
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,370
但其他两个人怎么办
But what about the other two?

156
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,500
他们埋得深多了
They're a lot deeper.

157
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,820
代达罗斯号很快就会到了
Well, the Daedalus will be here soon,

158
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,420
到时就可以把他们传送出来  对吗
so we can just beam them out, right?

159
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,850
只是要赶在迈克尔前头
As long as Michael doesn't get here first.

160
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,470
好吧  我们开工了
All right, let's get started.

161
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,430
里维斯  开艘小飞船进入太空轨道
Rivers, take a Jumper into orbit

162
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,430
密切注意迈克尔的飞船
and keep a look out for Michael's ship.

163
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,080
一看见他马上报告
Let me know the second he gets here.

164
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,620
一
One,

165
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,170
二
two,

166
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,610
三
three.

167
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,510
这东西完全不动
This thing ain't moving.

168
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,070
其他人怎么样了
What happened to the others?

169
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,270
我不晓得
I don't know.

170
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,800
崩塌发生地太快  没多少人能逃出来
It happened pretty quickly, not that many people made it out.

171
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,060
我太傻了
I'm so stupid.

172
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,950
这建筑明显是个陷阱
Of course the building was booby trapped.

173
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,240
-我应该早看出来的  -我们没人看出来
- I should have seen that coming. - Yeah, well none of us did.

174
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,810
-是的  但...  -什么
- Yeah, but... - What?

175
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,770
我是个男人  你知道...
I'm the guy, you know...

176
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,520
是"男人"的男人
like "the guy".

177
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,790
每个人都知道我们面对的是什么
Everyone knew what we were getting into.

178
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,220
我们都知道这有多危险
We all knew how dangerous it was

179
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,220
所以不要一棍子把自己打死
so don't beat yourself up about it.

180
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,670
你应该好好想想
You need to start thinking about

181
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,870
怎么把自己从这里弄出来
how to crawl your way outta here.

182
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,940
没有办法
No way.

183
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,710
说真的  你只要一直往上爬  推开残骸
Serious, you just keep moving up, keep moving the debris.

184
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,350
一步一步来
Work your way up.

185
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,220
谢帕德  我是不会丢下你不管的
I'm not leaving you behind, Sheppard.

186
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,410
我可不是逞英雄
I'm not trying to be a hero here.

187
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,010
只是为自己着想
It's a selfish thing.

188
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,370
你得挖个洞
I need you to dig a hole

189
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,390
这样救援队才能下来救我们
so that the rescuers can come down and get me.

190
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,080
老大  你搞错了
It's the wrong way, chief.

191
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,540
把这个梁挪开  你就能出来了
If we get this beam out of you, we get you free.

192
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,990
然后我们一起挖  好不
We'll dig ourselves out together. Deal?

193
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,980
无论如何你都不会听我的  是吧
You're not gonna listen to me one way or the other, are you?

194
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,130
说的没错
Great deal.

195
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,090
太好了
Excellent.

196
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,050
真是太好了
This is all very good.

197
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,760
你的儿子很快就要出生了
Your son should be making an appearance any day now.

198
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,600
我想听到这消息你该开心才是
I thought that would make you happy.

199
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,850
怀着孩子对你来说
I can't imagine carrying a child inside of you

200
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,850
肯定很不舒服
is very comfortable.

201
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,600
我不会伤害他的
I will not harm him.

202
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,540
-为什么你不接受呢  -因为我了解你
- Why can't you just accept that? - Because I know you.

203
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,210
大千世界
All these worlds filled with people

204
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,120
可怜的人类一生忙碌而终
busying themselves with their pathetic lives.

205
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,380
他们来了又走  生了又死
They come and they go, they live and they die,

206
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,790
银河系对他们已足够  而你的儿子...
and the galaxy is no better for it, but your son...

207
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,210
你的儿子是变革之子
your son will be an instrument of change.

208
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,880
他会被这些时代所铭记
He will be remembered for the ages.

209
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,300
那他的母亲呢
And what of his mother?

210
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,050
你总说他的未来  从未谈及我  为什么
You speak often of his future, but never of mine, why is that?

211
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,720
我希望你可以...
I'd hoped that you would...

212
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,400
-我希望你可以理解  -到时间了
- I had hoped that you would understand. - It's time.

213
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,940
很好
Very well.

214
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,730
解除手铐  安排守卫在门口把守
Remove the restraints and post a guard outside this door.

215
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,660
我必须在孩子出生前逃离这里
I must escape before our child is born.

216
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,130
一旦我没有利用价值  他就会杀了我
He will kill me once I'm of no use to him.

217
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,770
-我不能  -迦楠  为什么
- I can't. - Kanaan, why?

218
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,430
-这太危险了  -对谁来说
- It is too dangerous. - For who?

219
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,240
他会杀了我们
He will kill us.

220
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,520
杀了全部人
Kill us all.

221
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
是的  他会动手的
Yes, he will.

222
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,600
不管你是否帮我都一样
Whether you help me or not,

223
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,550
他一利用完就会丢弃你  你还不明白么
you are disposable to him, can you not see that?

224
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,360
听我说
Listen to me.

225
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,220
迦楠
Kanaan.

226
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,120
拜托你
Please.

227
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,750
求求你了!
Please!

228
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,580
来这边
Come over here.

229
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,930
我很好  只是些擦伤
I'm fine, it's just a couple scratches.

230
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,450
罗德尼·麦凯拒绝接受治疗
Rodney McKay refusing medical help,

231
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,450
一定有什么事不对劲
now I really know there's something wrong.

232
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,060
说正经的  我还好  你好好照顾罗恩
Seriously, I'm okay, just you should look after Lorne.

233
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,660
还有其他生还者吗
Any survivors?

234
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,820
我们还发现还有两个活着
We found two other life signs

235
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,820
但他们被埋地更深一些
but they're burried under a lot more debris.

236
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,610
所以要多花点时间
So it's going to take a little longer.

237
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,610
但我们正在努力施救
I've got people working on it.

238
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,070
知道是谁吗
We know who it is?

239
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,610
还无法确认
Not yet.

240
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,990
-找到泰勒了吗  -还没
-Did you find Teyla?  -No.

241
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,800
但谢帕德是对的
But I think Sheppard was right.

242
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,240
他要带她来这里了  我们来早了
He was gonna bring her here.We just came to soon.

243
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,730
-卡特上校  -请讲
-Colonel Carter.  -Go ahead.

244
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,500
在外太空发现幽灵巡洋舰
Ma'am, a Wraith cruiser just came out of hyperspace.

245
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,380
迈克尔要来了
Michael's here.

246
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,060
出现大量生命迹象
Multiple life signs.

247
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,340
一定是亚特兰蒂斯的人
It must be the Atlantians.

248
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,230
他们在搜索废墟
They're combing the debris.

249
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,980
但他们肯定知道留在那太危险了
But they must know it's too dangerous to stay here.

250
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,940
他们在寻找幸存者
They're searching for survivors.

251
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,110
这次不会再失败了
This might not be a total loss,after all.

252
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,080
所有人回到飞船
Everyone, fall back to your Jumpers!

253
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,330
敌人来了
We got incoming!

254
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,890
好枪法
Good shot!

255
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,950
大家退回飞船
Let's fall back to our Jumpers.

256
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,730
我们还有人被困在底下
We still got men trapped down here.

257
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,140
他们得等等了  现在也不能把他们挖出来
They'll have to wait.We're no good to them out.

258
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,570
快点  退回去
Let's go! Fall back!

259
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,340
-把飞船隐形  -是
- Cloak the ship.  - Got it!

260
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,810
我们得到信号  星门要被激活了
We're getting a reading.The Gate's been activated.

261
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,130
这是幽灵族的作战方式
Wraith battle technique:

262
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,550
拨号  锁住一切  困住所有人
dial the Gate, lock everyone out,make sure they can't escape.

263
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,920
-好方法  -但他们可不是笨蛋
- Well it's a good one.- Well, they're not idiots.

264
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,530
越来越多幽灵战斗机靠近废墟了
We got more darts on the way and they got troups on the debris field.

265
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,010
他们肯定是知道我们还有人在下面
Must know we got people there.

266
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,330
-我们有多少飞船  -加上这艘有三架
- How many Jumpers do we have?  - Three including this one.

267
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,140
对方有超过20架
I'm reading over twenty darts!

268
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,620
但他们应该看不到我们吧
But they can't see us though, right?

269
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,640
我们隐形时是无法开火的
We can't fire while we're cloaked.

270
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,770
他们同样要花点时间才能把人挖出来
Look, it's gonna take them time to dig them out. The same as us.

271
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,030
我们在这等代达罗斯号
We wait for the Daedalus.

272
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,380
罗德尼  进入轨道吧
Rodney, take us into orbit.

273
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,540
幽灵战斗机进入最小阻力
Darts reporting minimal resistance.

274
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,640
他们已经开始搜索废墟了
They've started searching the debris.

275
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,580
我们要快点  必须要活口
We must work fast.I need them alive.

276
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,560
就是这个
Here it is.

277
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,110
-那就是迈克尔的巡洋舰  -好像是
- Is that Michael's cruiser?  - Well, it looks like it.

278
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,840
这意味着泰勒在那船上吗
Does that mean that Teyla's on that ship?

279
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,400
有可能
It's possible.

280
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,170
太好了  不是吗
Well, that's great, though, right?

281
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,690
代达罗斯号来时  就能将她传输过来
When the Daedalus shows up we can just beam her up too, no?

282
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,310
没那么简单
It's not as easy as that.

283
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,520
可能迈克尔已经把她转移了
Chances are Michael has already removed her transmitter.

284
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,860
就算没有
And even if he hasn't,

285
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,410
环绕在幽灵巡洋舰周围的电磁波
Wraith cruisers surround themselves with

286
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,430
也会干扰我们的射线
an electromagnetic jamming field.

287
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,320
光束无法进去  也无法出来
No beaming in, no beaming out.

288
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,260
我们是近在咫尺啊
We're so close.

289
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,160
再试试吧
How about one more try?

290
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,970
我没力了  老兄
I feel pretty weak, buddy.

291
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,990
你不会对我没信心吧
You're not quiting on me yet, are you?

292
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,010
不会
No.

293
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,090
我刚刚还在考虑这个问题
I was thinking about it.

294
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,500
你要知道这不是你要考虑的
You know this is part of our deal?

295
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,050
你对这个决定还有意见啊
You keep adding things to this deal of ours.

296
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,100
准备
Ready?

297
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,840
一
One,

298
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,690
二
two,

299
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,490
三
three.

300
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,990
你自己走吧
I need you to get outta here.

301
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,500
如果我被困住了你会抛弃我吗
Would you leave me if I was stuck under there?

302
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,450
会
Yes.

303
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,730
你听到没
You hear that?

304
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,920
什么
What?

305
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,160
挖掘的声音
It sounds like digging.

306
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,450
是的
Yeah.

307
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,340
他们来了
They're here.

308
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,660
他们来了
They're here.

309
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,260
我们在下面
We're down here!

310
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,190
我们来救你们了  挺住啊
We're coming for you, just stay calm!

311
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,970
还打算放弃吗
And you were gonna quit.

312
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,390
发现另一艘飞船行踪
Reading another ship in orbit.

313
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,410
是幽灵巡洋舰
It's a Wraith cruiser.

314
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,510
展开防护盾  准备光波武器
Shields up.Ready forward beam weapons.

315
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,410
长官  卡特上校发来密报
Sir, I'm receiving a coded transmission from Colonel Carter.

316
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,630
-萨曼  怎么回事  -长话短说
-Sam, what's going on?  -Long story for short

317
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,850
那是迈克尔的巡洋舰
that's Michael's cruiser and

318
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,870
泰勒好像就在那里
he likely has Teyla onboard.

319
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:29,920
这样的话  我们就不能炸毁它了
So I can't blow him out of the sky.

320
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,990
恐怕不能
No, I'm afraid not.

321
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,510
舰队遭受攻击  防护盾已打开
We're taken fire, sir.Shields are holding.

322
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,310
我们攻击前他们已经展开防御了
They managed to get the shields up before we hit them.

323
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,930
这太不幸了
That's unfortunate.

324
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,750
增强能量超光速推进
Transfer power to the hyperdrive.

325
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,820
那些战斗机怎么办
What about the Darts?

326
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,330
必要的损失
Acceptable losses.

327
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,790
他准备撤离了
He's running.

328
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,750
可以的话全力攻击它的超光速推进器
Not if I can help it.Target his hyperdrive.

329
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:00,850
是  长官
Yes, sir.

330
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,450
我们失去超光速系统了
We've lost hyperdrive!

331
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,260
我知道正面对抗在所难免了
I guess we're fighting, after all.

332
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,950
防护盾下降了百分之八十
Shields are down to 80%.

333
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,530
代达罗斯号  我们还有2人被困在星球
Daedalus, we still have two people on the planet.

334
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,320
超光速系统要赶到那里只是时间问题
And it's just a matter of time before the hybrids reach them.

335
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,320
你能扫描一下传输信号吗
Can you scan for transmitter signals?

336
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,170
镇定点  马上就到了
Stay calm. We're almost there.

337
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,620
以后我再也不拿工程兵开玩笑了
I'm gonna stop making fun of combat engineers.

338
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,520
从今天开始  我发誓
As of today, I promise.

339
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,830
赫利什也跟你们在一起吗
Is Herrish up there with you?

340
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,050
是的  他在这呢  别着急
Yeah, he's here! Don't worry,

341
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,620
很快就可以把你们弄出去了
we'll have you out soon.

342
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,050
唐·赫利什至少下个月才能回来
Don Herrish is on leave until next month.

343
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,290
等会我们出去后
If we get outta here,

344
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,730
兄弟们  我请喝酒
beer is on me, boys.

345
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,270
你想喝点什么
What do you like?

346
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,850
达夫啤酒?
Duff beer?

347
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,120
还是欧普拉麦酒
Or Oprah Ale?

348
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,610
达夫吧
Duff

349
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,230
看来他们没看过"辛普森一家"
Well, they don't watch The Simpsons,

350
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,930
也从不喝酒
or drink beer.

351
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,910
是迈克尔的超光速系统
Michael's hybrids.

352
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,210
可能他是倒塌时被困住了
Maybe he was tipped off when the builing blew up.

353
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,060
我都说刚刚应该离开这里的
You totally should have gotten out of here.

354
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,440
不管了
Yeah, whatever.

355
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,740
我拿不到枪
I can't reach my gun.

356
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,280
给
Here.

357
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,910
好的
All right.

358
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,020
你想怎么玩
How do you wanna play this?

359
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,920
战斗到最后一刻
Shoot until we can't shoot anymore.

360
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,280
好吧  就这样
All right.

361
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,200
荣幸之至
Been a pleasure.

362
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,270
同感
Same.

363
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,390
找到他们了  是谢帕德上校和若楠
We got 'em.It's Colonel Sheppard and Ronon.

364
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,430
可以把他们光波传送上来吗
Can you beam them up?

365
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,490
这样的话要撤掉防护盾
We'd have to drop our shields,

366
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,060
这可不是好主意
I kind of think that'd be a bad idea right now.

367
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,520
如果迈克尔先得手  会杀了他们的
If Michael gets his hands on them,he'll kill them.

368
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,110
我们别无选择
We don't have a choice.

369
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,220
撤掉防护盾  马上光波传输
Be ready to drop the shields.As soon as they're down,

370
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,410
-把他们两个弄上来  -是  长官
-beam them directly to the infirmary.-Yes, sir.

371
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,240
萨曼  你们也一起上来吧
Sam, you should bring your Jumpers onboard at the same time.

372
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,490
明白  准备就位
Understood, we're in position.

373
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,040
好的
All right.

374
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,030
开始
Do it.

375
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,810
好了  飞船也上来了
We got 'em.Jumpers are in the bay.

376
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,930
展开防御
Shields up!

377
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,960
敌舰再次展开防护盾
Enemy vessel's raised shields again.

378
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,190
-攻击几乎无效  -继续开炮
-We scored several direct hits.-Keep firing.

379
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,990
现在形势怎样
How are we doing?

380
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,790
不太好  失去了亚光速
Not so good. Lost sublight,

381
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,810
超光速系统和武器都受损了
hyperdrive, and Asgard weapons.

382
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,470
动力源减少了55%
Life support's down at 55%.

383
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,490
防护盾呢
What about the shields?

384
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,090
还能挺一下  不过快不行了
They're holding for now but we're basically dead in the water.

385
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,350
别碰我
Don't touch me.

386
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,030
差点就失去你了
Thought we'd lost you there.

387
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,040
是啊  当时我也这么觉得
Yeah, well, for a second,I thought we lost me.

388
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,790
一切都会好起来的  对吧
It's gonna be okay though, right?

389
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,100
是的
Yeah.

390
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,310
不过还需要好好治疗
You need some serious work but you should...

391
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,670
现在可不能上战场了
you know, live to fight another day and all that.

392
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,170
现在情况怎样
what's going on? I guess

393
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,680
迈克尔比代达罗斯号早了一步吧
Michael showed up before the Daedalus.

394
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,190
是啊  我们迅速收起防护盾才能把
Yeah, we had to lower the shields

395
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,210
你们成功传送上来的
to beam you up here.

396
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,820
不好意思了
Sorry about that.

397
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,990
相信麦凯和卡特上校会摆平一切
I'm sure McKay and Colonel Carter will be able to fix it.

398
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,950
麦凯还活着吗
McKay is alive?

399
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,940
是啊
Yeah.

400
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,170
他和罗恩是从废墟中挖出来的
Yeah, he and Lorne were the only two to make it out of the rumble.

401
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,630
-我要回到前线  -不  听着
-I need to get back out there.  -No, no, look,

402
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,800
你会好起来的
you will be fine,

403
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,330
但可不是现在
but you're far from it now.

404
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,050
你失血很严重  需要手术
You've lost a lot of blood.You need surgery

405
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,270
要输血  这不能等
and a transfusion.I mean, this can't wait.

406
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,470
听着  医生  迈克尔来了
Look, Doc, Michael's here.

407
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,340
这意味着泰勒可能也在那
That means Teyla's probably on the ship.

408
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,550
这么近的距离我怎么可能坐得住
I'm too close to sit here and do nothing.

409
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:51,600
你还有事要做  那就是等着做手术
You're not gonna be doing nothing,you're gonna be laying here in surgery.

410
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,080
那必须...先随便包扎一下好了
That's gotta be like...It's gotta be a quick fix, just...

411
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,980
-不行  -只要几小时就行
-No.  -I need a few hours.

412
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,570
对不起  我不能那样做
I'm sorry, I can't.

413
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,370
我本来是有机会能
I have had the chance

414
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,000
救身边队友的
to rescue a teammate before.

415
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,430
只要伸一下手
And it slipped through my hands.

416
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,220
我不能再让这种事发生
I am not letting that happen again.

417
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,100
-干得好  -那当然
-Nice one.  -Of course.

418
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,390
虽然动力源还没回到最佳状态
Life support's still not working at full power but

419
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,670
但已经可以正常运转了
at least we won't freeze to death.

420
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,950
亚光速系统基本回到正轨
I've almost got sublight back online,

421
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,920
不过那些家伙正在猛攻防护盾
but the way these guys are taxing our shields,

422
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,360
剩余能源已不多
we won't have any power to spare anyway.

423
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,440
我们得逼出他们的主要武器
We need to take out the cruiser's main weapons.

424
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,780
想怎么用
Yeah, with what?

425
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,990
发动2至3次进攻
We can launch a 3 or 2 attack.

426
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,470
我也这么想
That's what I was thinking.

427
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,050
上校  凯勒医生说你还不能接任务
Colonel. Dr. Keller said you were out of commission.

428
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,870
她刚刚修正了诊断结果
She revised her diagnosis.

429
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,110
听着  我们有个想法
Look, we may have an idea.

430
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,460
或许能把泰勒救出来
Maybe a way to get Teyla back.

431
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,880
我们要逼出巡洋舰的主武器
We need to take out the cruiser's main weapons.

432
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,740
最简单的方法就是302s展开攻击
The easiest way to do that right now is to launch an attack with 302s.

433
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,260
我不觉得这是好方法
Well, I wouldn't exactly call that easy.

434
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,280
他们肯定会派出幽灵战机拦截
They'll send Darts to intercept them.

435
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,770
这正是我们计划的一部分
That's what we're counting on.

436
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,830
这轮攻击会让他们打开战艇的舱门
To launch them, they'll open the bay.

437
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,510
到时我们坐着隐形飞船
If we have a cloaked Jumper in place,

438
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,860
偷偷潜行进去就不会被发现
a team should be able to sneak onto the cruiser undetected.

439
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,770
救回泰勒  然后一路打回来
Find Teyla, bust her out and blast our way home.

440
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,820
总的来说  好像这次营救计划
As a rule, I like to keep daring

441
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,510
要一天才能完成啊
rescues down to one a day.

442
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,530
防护盾已剩下20%
Look, shields are already down to 20%,

443
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:23,040
被击破只是时间问题
it's just a matter of time before they fail completely.

444
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,410
她就靠我们了  史蒂文
She's over there, Steven,counting on us.

445
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,750
我可接受不了"不行"这个答复
I won't take "no" for an answer.

446
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,970
好吧  带上隐形飞船
All right, take a cloaked Jumper.

447
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,080
就位后马上出发
Radio us when you're in position.

448
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,100
-在医务室里到底发生了什么  -没什么
-What really happened in the infirmary?  -Nothing.

449
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,770
是不是打算告诉我  如果我去问珍妮弗
You're telling me, if I go down there and talk to Jennifer,

450
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,720
她会说你太适合做任务了
she'll tell me that you're fit for duty.

451
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,730
-我只想做好工作  -我也一样
-I'm just trying to do a job.  -So am I.

452
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,440
我工作的一部分就是
And part of my job is determining whether or not

453
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,660
看你适不适合工作
you're gonna be a liability on this mission.

454
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:04,980
所有指挥官里我最敬佩你
I have more respect for you than any commanding officer I've ever had but,

455
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,880
但我还是要回到飞船上  结束这一切
I'm getting on that Jumper,end of story.

456
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,250
最后我会去军事法庭认错的
I'll surrender for court martial when I'm done.

457
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,540
若楠和我两个人就能处理好这事
You know, Ronon and I could probably handle this.

458
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,280
或许你该留在飞船上
Maybe you should stay with the Jumper.

459
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,390
当然一起也可以
Or not.

460
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,490
-代达罗斯号  我们已就位  -收到
-Daedalus, we're in position.  -Confirmed.

461
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,740
发射302s
Launch 302s.

462
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,700
302s正在靠近
302s are approaching.

463
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,090
幽灵战斗机  来吧
Give me the Darts.

464
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,830
-它要关闭了  -我看到了
-It's closing.  -I see that.

465
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,930
-马上要关了  -知道了
-It's closing quickly.  -I got it.

466
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,770
代达罗斯号  我们已进入
Daedalus, we're in.

467
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,440
成功了  他们刚刚失去了主要武器
It worked.Cruiser just lost main weapons.

468
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,540
希望谢帕德一样好运吧
Let's hope that Sheppard has the same luck.

469
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,240
好了  只需要几秒钟
All right, this won't take more than a couple of seconds.

470
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,560
有麻烦了
That's troubling.

471
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:56,910
怎么了
What?

472
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,840
迈克尔居然对它作了远程修复
Michael's a lot further ahead with the repairs than I would have thought.

473
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,190
超光速系统还能用  要快点了
Hyperdrive's almost back online.We got to make this quick.

474
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:05,340
-具体要多快  -15分钟  没时间了
-What do you mean quick?  -15 minutes. It's not a lot of time.

475
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,880
现在可没那么多时间啊
No, it's not a lot of time. So...

476
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,870
不如直接告诉我们泰勒在哪好了
why don't you tell us where Teyla is, already?

477
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,570
好吧  好吧  好吧
All right, all right, all right.

478
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,230
行了
Got it! Okay.

479
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,160
跟我来
Follow me.

480
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,390
还是  你先吧
Or... you...

481
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,730
-约翰  -我们要进去了
-John?  -We're going to get down here.

482
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,720
没时间了
Not a moment too soon.

483
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,470
我们得把你弄回飞船上去
We got to get you back to the Jumper.

484
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,890
你还好吗
You okay?

485
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,290
-是肚子里的孩子  -哪里不舒服
- It's my baby.- What? Is something wrong?

486
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:51,850
不  我只是宫缩了快一个小时
No. I have been having contractions for over an hour now.

487
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,860
他们就要出来了
They're very close.

488
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,930
我快要生了
My baby's coming.

489
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,160
老天!
God!

490
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,450
不好意思
I'm sorry.

491
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,900
给我点时间
I just need a moment.

492
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,030
我可以抱她的  只是我现在也撑不住了
I'd carry her buddy but...I'm not really up to it.

493
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,620
-你准备好了吗  -没事  我能走
- Yeah. Okay, you're ready?- No. I can walk.

494
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,720
我需要点时间
I just need a moment.

495
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,370
伙计们  现在有点小问题
Say, friends,we have a small issue, here.

496
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,430
又怎么了
Oh, what now?

497
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,230
看样子迈克尔把推进器又开起来了
Looks like Michael got his hyperdrive back online.

498
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,230
正在消耗能量了
It's powering up

499
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,590
-能把它关掉么  -用这个可不行
- Can you shut it down?- Not from this little thing.

500
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,310
驾驶室在通道尽头
The drive room is down the corridor.

501
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,610
拿一个C-4炸药去肯定管用
You slap a C-4 charge on that thing,it should certainly shut it down.

502
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,520
-哪儿  -这  我有地图
- Where?- Here. I've a map.

503
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,020
好吧  若楠  你跟我来
All right. Ronon, you're with me.

504
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,660
我马上回来  没事的
I'll be right back.Everything is gonna be fine.

505
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,790
你照顾好她
You take care of her.

506
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:06,640
呃
So...

507
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,450
你怎么样了
how are you doing?

508
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,190
痛极了
The pain is very great.

509
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,270
哦  对的
Oh yeah.

510
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,180
我得过一次肾结石  真的是痛极了
Yeah I had a kidney stone once.Incredibly painful.

511
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,860
就和我的一样  所以我能了解
Same kind of thing from what I'm told.So I hear you.

512
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,060
实际上  我的猫也和我同时得的结石
Actually, my cat and I had oneat the same time.

513
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,800
我们在一起总没好事
We were not fun to be around,

514
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,470
它是因为总吃得太干  而我因为没喝水
He, 'cause he was eating the dry food,I wasn't drinking enough liquids.

515
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,140
所以你看我总喝水  因为我可不想再犯
That's why you always see me hydrating.I've no desire to experience that again.

516
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,100
-只是...  -很有意思  谢谢
- It's just...- Fascinating story.

517
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,450
好吧
Yes, no problem.

518
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,540
深呼吸  深呼吸
Okay just, just breathe?Breathe, okay?

519
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,650
-你在干吗  -给你助产  应该...
- What you doing?- It's Lamaze. It's supposed to...

520
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,610
我也不知道我在干吗  你需要我怎么做
I don't know what I'm doing.What do you need me to do?

521
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,430
在这儿  在这儿呢
Okay, there it is, there they are.

522
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,000
我要生了
The baby is coming!

523
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,960
坚持住  等回去了  凯勒会帮你接生
Hang on. We'll get back on the Deadelus,Keller can pull it out.

524
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,000
就要生了  现在！
The baby is coming now!

525
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,820
-快消耗光了  -给我C-4
- It's almost powered up.- Give me your C-4.

526
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,930
-把它给我  -我能行
- Give it to me.- I got it.

527
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,050
把它给我  不要什么都扛着
Give it to me.You don't have to do everything.

528
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,450
搞定了  准备好了吗
All right. You're ready?

529
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,240
走
Let's go.

530
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,390
好了  但愿我们离得够远
All right.Let's hope we're far enough away.

531
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,850
来  瞧瞧
Yeah, we'll see.

532
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,690
炸起来吧
Fire in the hole.

533
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,490
-怎么回事  -推进器爆炸了
- What happenend?- Hyperdrive just exploded.

534
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,340
不可能
No. That's impossible.

535
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,410
船体主能源供应不足
Main power is out across most of the ship.

536
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,970
-偶尔超负荷了?  -不太像
- An accidental overload?- Doesn't appear that way.

537
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,980
他们是怎么办到的
How did they do that?

538
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,600
我会查清楚的
I will look into it.

539
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,210
他们上来了
They're onboard.

540
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,260
他们是怎么上船的
How did they get onboard?

541
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,590
-就不能憋着不生?  -不可能  罗德尼
- Well, can't you just hold it in?- No, Rodney!

542
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,350
不会这么快的  不会这么快就生出来的
This doesn't happen this quick!No one has babies this quick!

543
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,390
我的羊水早就破了
My water broke quite a while ago.

544
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,150
我一直在试着...
I've been trying to...

545
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,870
噢  我看见脑袋了
Oh, I can see its head.

546
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,510
这是好事  这样才对  罗德尼
That's good.That's a good thing, Rodney.

547
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,710
我能碰么  我该做什么
Yeah but am I supposed to touch it?Am I allowed? I don't know what to do!

548
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,800
罗德尼
Rodney,

549
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,150
冷静  你得冷静点
calm down.I need you to be calm.

550
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,050
我不是医生  我从来就没当过医生
But I'm not an MD.I've never been an MD!

551
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,270
人类生小孩都生了几千年了
People have been having babies for thousands of years.

552
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,620
大多数时候都没有医生
Most without doctors.

553
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,140
没有医生死亡率就高
But before doctors the infantile mortality rate was very high.

554
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,620
差不多有三分之一了
Something like one in three.

555
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,790
相信我  医生真的很重要
No, a doctor is a very important part of this process, trust me.

556
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,880
现在没有医生了  得你来
There are no doctors around. You have to do this.

557
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,310
我们没的选了
We don't have a choice.

558
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,580
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay.

559
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,630
现在
Now,

560
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,020
你抓住他
you need to catch him.

561
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,530
－抓?  －是的  抓住他
- Catch him?- Yes. You need to catch him,

562
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:11,070
-我会用力推他出来  -天哪
- while I push him out.- Oh, God!

563
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,580
好吧 来
OK, well, just...

564
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,350
伸到下面  我打不好棒球的
Underhand him, all right.I've never been good at baseball.

565
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,480
罗德尼  拜托了
Rodney,Please.

566
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,480
我能行
Okay, I can do this!

567
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,820
虽然我还是有点怕  但是我们能行的
All right, I may have panicked a little back there but we're gonna do this!

568
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,900
我总是和小孩子处得好
I am great with kids.

569
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,880
小伙计  不顶嘴的小家伙
The little ones.The ones who don't talk back.

570
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,290
要出来了
Here he comes!

571
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,290
快了 快了
Okay. Almost there, almost there!

572
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,630
我抓到他了
I got him!

573
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:47,880
我接住了
I got him!

574
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,550
是个男孩
It's a boy.

575
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,440
-小心他的脑袋  -对  对
- Watch his head.- Right, right. OK.

576
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,540
上帝啊
Oh, God!

577
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,140
该剪脐带了么  可以剪脐带了吧
Do I get to cut the cord?I can cut the cord now, right?

578
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,610
好了  来
OK, OK. Here you go.

579
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,280
就这样
Yeah. OK. So...

580
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,450
来  泰勒
Right, Teyla,

581
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,520
郑重介绍  这是你的儿子
I'd like to introduce you to your son.

582
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,720
我成功了  没有出什么差错
I got it! Didn't let it fall or anything.

583
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,240
你做得棒极了
You did a wonderful job.

584
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,550
真是太棒了
That's good, that's...

585
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,260
你很棒  罗德尼
You're good, Rodney.

586
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,550
我们会带你离开这里
We got to get you out of here.

587
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,000
若楠  帮我一把
Ronon, you may need to help me.

588
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,030
这样?
Ready?

589
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,500
-它为什么是隐形的  -你弄坏了?
- Why isn't it decloaking?- Let me see, did you break it?

590
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,350
不  不  飞船就是停在这儿的
No, no...We parked the Jumper right here.

591
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,510
-是的  -一点不差
- Yes.- One hundred percent.

592
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,800
飞船被人偷走了
Someone stole the Jumper.

593
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,680
大事不好
This is not good.

594
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,500
我就说了  你该留在这儿
I told you you should have stayed here.

595
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,310
这下子我们该怎么离开这里
How the hell are we supposed to get off this ship, now?

596
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,430
我刚接生了  今天的任务就差不多了吧
I just delivered a baby.That's not enough for today?

597
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:40,470
他们就没有什么逃生舱之类的东西么
Don't they have escape pods or things like that on the cruiser?

598
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,660
没有...
No, they...

599
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,380
等等
Wait...

600
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,560
我有法子了
I know...

601
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,320
我们去找一个终端机
We need to get back to a terminal.

602
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,440
它们多数能量都比较低
A lot of their internal power is down.

603
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,530
我可以使干扰台短路
Maybe I can short out the jamming code

604
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,590
这样代达罗斯号就可以把我们传送回去
we can get the Daedalus to beam us out.

605
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,130
很好  带路吧
Great. Lead the way.

606
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,830
别开枪  放我下来
Don't shoot! Put me down.

607
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,440
没关系的  约翰
It's all right, John.

608
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
这是迦楠
This is Kanaan.

609
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,630
他是孩子的父亲
He is the father.

610
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,830
这是我们的机会
This is our chance.

611
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,960
这些是我告诉过你的朋友
These are the friends I told you of.

612
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:42,530
他们会帮助你  帮你变回原来的自己
They can help you.Get back to your old self.

613
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,140
但是你得先帮我们
But first you have to help us.

614
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,110
我们得离开这条船
We must get off this ship.

615
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,090
你有法子么
Do you know a way?

616
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,550
是的
Yes.

617
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,200
-跟我来  -不是想冒犯你  泰勒
- Follow me.- No offence, Teyla.

618
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,570
我不相信这家伙
I don't trust this guy.

619
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,400
他之前就试过救我
He has tried to save me before.

620
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,580
所以我相信他
I trust him.

621
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,730
把武器给我
Give me your weapon.

622
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,700
说说你的计划
What's your plan?

623
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,140
长官  有艘幽灵战斗机向我们发出呼叫
Sir?We've got a Dart trying to hail us.

624
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,780
什么
What?

625
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,100
我来听下
Let me hear it.

626
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,430
约翰·谢帕德上校呼叫  验证码
This is Colonel John Sheppard.Authentication code:

627
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,370

I got all turned around in the garage.I was in a rush, I borrowed this Dart.

我的小组都被传送进了一个存储装置
I've got the team beamed into the storage device.

632
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,740

- Do you have Teyla?- Yes, and the baby.

633
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,960
那孩子也被送进去了?
You beamed a baby into Wraith storage?

634
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,280
没有
No.

635
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,140
我现在正抱着呢
I got it right here.

636
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,620
那么
So...

637
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,990
那艘巡洋舰就随你处置

00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,800
击退那艘飞船
Please make that ship go away.

641
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,300

642
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,890
上校  你可以回我们星球了

643

把你的组员传送回去  船也找个地降落
beam your crew out and land that Dart.

644
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,580
我想现在可以去星门拨号了
I'm sure you can dial up that Stargate now.

645
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,540
收到

646
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,330

- What's with the bags?- What's with the flowers?

647
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,510
我准备去看泰勒
I'm going to see Teyla.

648
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,730
听说了吗  她的孩子是我接生的
You heard I delivered her baby?

649
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,760
听说了
I did.

650
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,060
而且听说她准备给宝宝起名罗德尼
And they tell me she's going to name him Rodney.

651
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,450
太棒了  真的吗
Yes! Really?

652
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,560
假的
No. Not really.

653
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,020
-真有意思  你去哪儿  -回地球一趟
- That's funny. Where are you going?- Back to Earth.

00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,040

- What? Why?- They caught the last Ba'al clone.

655
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,450
Tok'ra要分离共生体  想让SG-1的人到场
The Tok'ra gonna extract the symbiote.They want SG-1 to put in an appearance.

656
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,620
再说了
Plus,

657
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,320
国际勘察顾问组织想要做个"详细的调查"
the IOA wants to do an exhaustive review

658
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,940
看看我接管的第一年做的怎样
of my first year in command, so...

659
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,790
-一定没什么好事  -你说笑吗
- That can't be good.- Are you crazy?

660
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,880
他们一定是想给你颁奖章了
They probably want to give you a medal.

661
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,400
这一年你做得很棒
You had a great year.

662
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,540
我知道我的意见不顶什么用
I know my opinion doesn't mean much to those folks, but...

663
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,300
不过我还是认为你做得很棒
I think you've done an excellent job.

664
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,190
我很庆幸是你接了这个工作
I'm glad you took the post.

665
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,650
罗德尼  谢谢  这些话对我很重要
Thanks Rodney, that means a lot.

666
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,300
告诉谢帕德军事法庭的事还会再缓缓
Tell Sheppard the court martial will have to wait.

667
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,680

668
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,110
希望如此
I hope so.

669
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,810
手术要多长时间
How long will the surgery take?

670
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,080
医生说得几个小时
The Doc says a few hours.

671
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,740
或许一周都不能走路
I'll be off my feet for a week or so.

672
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,420
真难以置信你这样子还试图进行营救
I cannot believe you attempted to mount a rescue in your condition.

673
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,630
试图?
Attempt?

674
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,500
上一次我进攻时  我就成功了
The last time I checked, I succeeded.

675
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,660
孩子怎么样
How's the kid?

676
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,710
凯勒医生说他健康情况很好

677
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,610
我想他一切都会很好的

678

679
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,130
很棒
It's great.

680
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,740
我要谢谢你
I want to thank you.

681
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,680
没这个必要
There's no need.

682
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,230
我一直都没有放弃  因为我知道
I never gave up hope, because I knew...

683
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,520

换成你  你也会这么做的

685

是的

在我看来  我好像没干什么
From my understanding,I'm... not doing anything.

690
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,540

如果你方便的话  我想叫他图门·约翰
Well, if it's all right with you,I was thinking of Tughan John.

696
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,730
用我父亲和你的名字命名
After my father and after you.

697

或许能够更好的主持亚特兰蒂斯的事务
would be more suited to lead the Atlantis expedition now.

714
