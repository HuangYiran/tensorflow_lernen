1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,862
好了  睁开眼吧
Okay, open them.

2
00:00:01,863 --> 00:00:03,030
- 怎么了  - 我们买不起这个的
- What? - We can't afford this.

3
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:04,798
你在开玩笑吗  我们当然买得起
Are you kidding me? Yes, of course we could.

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,000
我把退伍津贴全花这上面了
I spent my combat pay on it.

5
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:07,034
我们可以做朋友
We can be friends.

6
00:00:07,035 --> 00:00:08,302
我有些朋友都四十好几了
Some of my best friends

7
00:00:08,303 --> 00:00:10,104
还跟二十出头的年轻人约会
are 40-year-old guys who date 20-year-olds.

8
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:11,572
- 真的吗  - 当然不是  卡尔
- Really? - No, Carl, not really.

9
00:00:11,573 --> 00:00:12,973
我现在想知道什么
Anything I need to know about?

10
00:00:12,974 --> 00:00:14,074
你就得毫无保留地告诉我
You got to tell me this now.

11
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:15,843
我这儿没有你想知道的那档子事儿
There is nothing you need to know about.

12
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:16,944
我为你感到非常惋惜  好吗
I feel sorry for you, okay?

13
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:18,211
你为我感到惋惜  为什么
You feel sorry for me?Why?

14
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:21,048
你的那个儿子  对你来说就是个拖油瓶
That kid of yours,he's a retard.

15
00:00:21,049 --> 00:00:22,582
现在究竟是个什么状况
What is going on right now?

16
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,718
我们俩都是成年人了  现在我们要去喝酒了
We're too adults,here,and now we're having a drink.

17
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:25,886
她才十九，而你比她整整大了九岁
She's 19.You're 28.

18
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:27,755
我现在对你们感到非常失望
I'm extremely disappointed right now.

19
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:30,190
我们得讨论一下让他留级的事儿
We need to discuss getting him back into fourth grade.

20
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:31,224
我们不会那样做的
We're not doing that.

21
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:33,894
你要是不喜欢这样的话  就跟艾德说去
You don't like it, talk to ed.

22
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:36,596
我的艺术班要去意大利一个月
My art class is going to Italy for a month.

23
00:00:36,597 --> 00:00:39,132
我要去
I'm gonna go.

24
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:42,235
独自一人去
By myself.

25
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:52,545
早上好  贝克里
Good morning, Berkeley!

26
00:00:53,547 --> 00:00:55,347
嗯
Mm.

27
00:00:55,348 --> 00:00:56,983
再有你就更好了
You'd better.

28
00:00:56,984 --> 00:00:58,217
啊哦
Uh-oh.

29
00:00:58,218 --> 00:00:59,552
拿到你了
There we go.

30
00:00:59,553 --> 00:01:00,953
好了
All right.

31
00:01:00,954 --> 00:01:03,823
? 乐队奏响了“致元首的欢呼”?
? And then the band plays"hail to the chief" ?

32
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:05,191
感觉不错
Oh, yeah.

33
00:01:07,627 --> 00:01:10,596
? 绝对不是我  绝对不是我 ?
? It ain't me, it ain't me ?

34
00:01:10,597 --> 00:01:13,265
哦  一杆进洞
Whoo, that's in the hole!

35
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:18,504
太棒了
Oh, yeah!

36
00:01:18,505 --> 00:01:20,606
?我绝非幸运的家伙?
? I ain't no fortunate one ?

37
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:22,474
气色不错嘛  奇克
Looking good, Zeek.

38
00:01:22,475 --> 00:01:25,777
嗨  谢莉
Hi, Shelly!

39
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:27,779
糟了
Gah.

40
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,987
看起来你的思绪整理的不错嘛
So, uh, looks like you made up your mind.

41
00:01:35,988 --> 00:01:38,123
你要去跳芭蕾而不是打篮球了
You gonna do ballet instead of basketball?

42
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:41,392
对  我要跟老妈一起去跳芭蕾
Yup, I'm doing ballet with mom now.

43
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:44,262
劈叉不错
Hey, nice turn-out.

44
00:01:44,263 --> 00:01:46,063
他看起来很棒对吧  亲爱的
Doesn't he look great, honey?

45
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,532
对啊
Yeah.

46
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,567
然后你只需要顺着
And then you just--we slide his pants

47
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,336
他自己的意愿  或者...
up on over those, or...

48
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:54,672
很棒
Okay.

49
00:01:54,673 --> 00:01:57,041
伊万校长也要与会
Principal Evans is gonna be at the meeting too.

50
00:01:57,042 --> 00:01:58,142
这可是件大事儿
This is a big deal.

51
00:01:58,143 --> 00:01:59,443
很棒  那我们周五出去
Okay, so we'll go out on Friday.

52
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:00,778
去搞清楚他们到底要谈什么
We'll find out what it's about then.

53
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:02,346
我们知道他们要谈什么  就那档子事儿嘛
Well, we know what it's about.This is it.

54
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:04,481
他们要谈因为维克多跟不上进度
This is when they're telling us they're gonna hold him back

55
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:06,050
要让他留级的事儿
because he's not keeping up.

56
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:08,418
- 这可不一定  茱莉亚  - 他现在还在努力呢
- We don't know that,Julia.- He's really still struggling.

57
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,653
- 这可不一定  - 好吧
- We don't know that. - Oh, fine.

58
00:02:09,654 --> 00:02:10,888
我只是太讨厌等待了
Well, I just hate waiting.

59
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,224
我知道  我都知道
I know you do.I know you do.

60
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:14,491
我不知道还能怎么做
I don't know what else I can do.

61
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:15,759
- 我是说  - 亲爱的
- I mean, - Honey.

62
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,227
我跟他一起努力了那么久
I've been working with him so much--

63
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:18,895
别这样  凡事儿都别往坏处想
Come on, let's not assume the worst, here

64
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:20,564
求你了  好吗
Please? Please?

65
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:22,232
我们都清楚他们要让他留级
We know that they're gonna hold him back.

66
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:24,934
维克多要重新去念四年级吗
Victor's going back to fourth grade?

67
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:27,271
- 不是  - 我说的可不是那样
- No. - That's not what I said.

68
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,172
是  你就是那样说的
Yes,it--that's exactly what you just said.

69
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:31,540
那样太糟了  我可不想跟他在同一班念书
That's awful.I don't want him in my class.

70
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,542
【全体七嘴八舌的在说话】
[All talking at once]

71
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:35,578
你需要穿上你的衣服还有拿上你的书

72
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,946
我已经都准备好我的东西了

你们得比之前更加努力的工作了
You guys have to work harder than ever.

I want you to work. Oh, it's the trib.

137
00:04:50,576 --> 00:04:52,378
他们可能想问民意检测的情况
They probably want a comment about the polls.

138
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:53,645
喂

Excuse me.Are you Adam Braverman?

144
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,996
对 我是
Yeah, I am.

145
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:13,598
请问你在超市对一位男士
Is it true that you violently assaulted

146
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,666
进行暴力攻击行为这是真的吗
a man in a supermarket?

147
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:15,733
什么
What?

148
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:17,635
你认为这些指控
How do you think these allegations

149
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:20,305
会影响你妻子的市长竞选吗

150
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:21,772
我...我不知道  你们能别拍...
I...I don't know.Would you please--

151
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:24,042
你曾经因愤怒管理问题接受过治疗吗
have you ever been treated for anger management issues?

152
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:25,509
布雷弗曼先生  我们有几个问题想问你
Mr. Braverman, we have questions.

153
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,378
没有  我没有  你们能从我家草地上离开吗
No, I have not.Would you just get off my lawn?

154
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:29,147
这可是私人财产
This is private property.

155
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:32,182
行吗  滚出我家的草地

179
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:23,550
你在超市暴力袭击一位男士的事儿是真的吗
Is it true that you violently assaulted a man in a supermarket?

180
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:25,452
什么  什么  什么
What? What? What?

181
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:26,987
你认为这些指控会影响
How do you think these allegations

182
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:28,922
你妻子的市长竞选吗
are going to affect your wife in her bid for mayor?

183
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:30,590
滚出我的草地  我不知道
Get off my lawn!I don't know.

184
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,458
滚出我的草地  滚出我的草地
Get off my lawn!Get off my lawn!

185
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,694
亲爱的  事情真没那么糟糕
You know,honey,it's not really--it's not that bad.

186
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:36,496
我当时根本就没时间去想  就应激反应而已
I didn't have time to think.I just reacted.

187
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:38,064
- 显而易见  - 你什么也没说
- Obviously. - You didn't say anything.

188
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,600
还有  下次遇到这种事  你只需要说“无可奉告”
Well, next time, you should just say "no comment."

189
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:41,801
- 下一次吗  - 然后走开就行了
- Next time? - And walk away.

190
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,169
我希望没有下次了
I hope there's not a next time.

191
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,005
我都不知道为什么会有这次的状况
I don't even know why there had to be a this time.

192
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:46,406
这都是三年前的事了
This was, like,three years ago.

193
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,341
- 这就是他们的伎俩  - 那个家伙侮辱了我的孩子
- Well, this is what they did.- The guy insulted my kid.

194
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:49,675
- 他叫我儿子拖油瓶  我就揍了他  - 他确实该打
- He called him a retard.I punched him. - He did.

195
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,044
我又没把他打进医院  可谁又会关心这个呢
It's not like I put him in the hospital. Who cares?

196
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:53,246
你当时做的很对  你做的非常对
You were right to do that.You were,you're right.

197
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,448
我非常高兴当时审查过你了  亚当
I'm glad I vetted you too,Adam.

198
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,250
我非常高兴在你办公室待了俩小时
I'm glad I spent those two hours in your office

199
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,052
你告诉我你跟
and you telling me about streaking

200
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:01,654
一对母女一起拍裸照的事儿
at a mother-daughter banquet and you were naked.

201
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,023
这高兴你么诶跟我说这件事
Glad you forgot to tell me about this.

202
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,524
- 在哪儿拍的  - 当时我和还在上高中
- Where? - When I was in High School.

203
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,892
- 你知道这件事的  - 真的吗
-  You know about this. - Really?

204
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,794
- 你们俩有听我说话吗  - 抱歉
- Are you guys paying attention? - Sorry.

205
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,263
我再说小鲍发现了一个能削弱你竞争力的方法
I'm saying Bob little has found a way to go negative.

206
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,297
我们一落千丈了
We're down to the wire.

207
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,599
他会将这俩百分点的优势
He can turn this two point lead

208
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,800
变成五个百分点的
into a five point lead.

209
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,201
我们到时候就任人宰割了
We'll be cooked when he does that.

210
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,670
你说得对
You're right.

211
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,039
我不明白他是怎么挖出这件事的
Well, I don't understand how he found out about this.

212
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
- 我也不知道  - 我告诉他的
- I don't either. - I told him.

213
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,908
- 什么  - 我...几年前
- What? - I--years ago.

214
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,977
我当年还在为他工作的时候告诉他的
I told him when I was working for him.

215
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,513
他当时觉得你这样做
He thought it was so awesome and that you were the man

216
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:29,747
是非常酷的  也非常棒
and it was so cool and great.

217
00:07:29,748 --> 00:07:30,949
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

218
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,417
我简直不敢相信那个小王八蛋
I can't believe that little bastard

219
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,519
能记起这件事还拿来攻击你
remembered this and tried to use it against you.

220
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,921
我懂了  你知道我们现在该怎么做吗
Yes, I get it.You know what we should do?

221
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:39,090
- 我们去召开一个记者发布会  - 不 不行
- Let's call a press conference. - No, no.

222
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,525
我们不需要再给他们更多答复
We don't need to give this more play.

223
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:43,861
我们需要消极手段了  这才是我们该做的
We need to go negative.That's what we need to do.

224
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:47,465
我们需要去挖掘一些“清白”先生的故事了
We need to find some story about mister squeaky clean.

225
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,133
然后再走露出去
Mr. little and leak that out.

226
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:50,935
- 他绝对不会是清白的  - 我知道他不是
- Oh, he's not squeaky clean. - I know he's not.

227
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:52,604
我已经厌倦了那种形象了
I'm tired of that image anyway.

228
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,172
我们得挖出一点猛料了
There's got to be something we could dig up on him.

229
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:57,241
- 你知道什么吗  你发现过...  - 我没有...
-You know anything?Anything you found out..-I don't..

230
00:07:57,242 --> 00:08:00,077
当你帮他竞选的时候  有出过什么事吗
When you were running his campaign,anything come up?

231
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:03,614
一定会有什么事的  我得去挖出来
There's got to be something.I'm gonna find it.

232
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:07,017
- 我爱你  - 今天过得怎么样
- I love you. - How was your day?

233
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:09,320
- 好吧  我累死了  - 是吗
- Okay. I'm tired. - Yeah?

234
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,989
我们在录一首新歌
Yeah, we just started recording a new track

235
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,556
而我觉得...我也说不清楚
and I'm just, like...I don't know.

236
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:14,925
我感觉像是被榨干了一样
I feel really drained.

237
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:17,961
有谁注意到你有所不同了吗
Anybody notice anything,uh,different about you?

238
00:08:19,597 --> 00:08:21,498
- 当然啦  - 那他们有何评价
- Yes, of course. - What'd they say?

239
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:23,533
- 他们怎么可能不评头论足嘛  - 他们有没有惊呆了
- How could they not? - Did they freak out?

240
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:26,769
他们简直不敢相信  对  他们...
They couldn't believe it.Yeah, they--

241
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,005
- 那他们兴奋吗  - 非常兴奋
- Were they excited? - Very excited.

242
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:30,507
他们觉得戒指非常赞
They thought it was amazing.

243
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:33,843
克罗斯比还说“千万别告诉贾思敏”
Yeah, Crosby said, you know,"don't show Jasmine that

244
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:36,379
“否则我就得加倍努力给她也买一个了”
or I'm gonna have to upgrade and get her one of those.

245
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,580
嗯  太糟了
Well, too bad.

246
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:39,115
这可是绝版的  所以她没机会了
It's one of a kind, so she can't...

247
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:42,152
- 这枚戒指吗  - 她没...对
- This? - She can't--yeah.

248
00:08:42,153 --> 00:08:43,519
- 哇哦  - 看看它
- Wow. - Look at that.

249
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,987
这世上的唯一
Only one in the world.

250
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:49,558
我甚至都不...我甚至都不敢再给它加工了
I don't even--I can't even process it.

251
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,426
它跟你简直是绝配
It's just--it looks so perfect on you.

252
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:53,162
这太不可思议了
It's crazy.

253
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:54,463
你喜欢吗
Do you like it?

254
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:56,532
太让人难以置信了
It's--it's--it's unbelievable.

255
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:00,202
我去做晚饭
I'm gonna make us dinner.

256
00:09:00,203 --> 00:09:02,204

263
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:20,288
真的吗
Really?

264
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:21,723
我正在尝试不同的食物搭配
I'm experimenting with different food groups.

谷质鲜奶油跟香蕉的结合体
It's cereal with whipped cream and a banana.

267
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:29,130
- 老爸  - 干嘛

268
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:30,699
你最近都是这么吃的吗

269
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,266
呃  貌似是吧  好吧 就是这样吃的
Uh, kind of, yeah.

270
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,701
你们这帮孩子怎么总时不时跑过来
Why do the kids keep stopping by here

271
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:35,102
是来视察我的现状吗
and then, like, checking on me?

272
00:09:35,103 --> 00:09:36,470
你们不需要来视察我
You don't need to check on me.

273
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:38,172
- 我一个人也会活得好好的  - 老爸  我就搞不懂了
- I'm gonna be fine. - Well, dad, I don't know.

274
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:39,907
你都一个人生活了那么久了
It's been a long time since you've been on your own

275
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:41,542
所以我才跑过来看看你的
and, you know, so I was next in the rotation..

276
00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:43,644
你也一个人生活那么久了
Well,it's been a long time since you've been on your own.

277
00:09:43,645 --> 00:09:44,912
你的孩子有来视察过你吗
Do the kids keep checking up on you?

278
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:46,314
- 别人有没有时不时跑来逗留呢  - 没有 老爸
- Do people stop by? - No, dad.

279
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:48,082
他们也不会提着这个包袱过来
And they don't bring me what's in this bag either,

280
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,184
- 所以我想我还是走吧   - 别 别  别
- so I guess I'll just go--  - No, no, no.

281
00:09:50,185 --> 00:09:51,384
等等  等等
Wait a minute.Hold it.

282
00:09:51,385 --> 00:09:53,520
- 嗯   - 回来
- Hm? - Get back here.

283
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:55,488
你包里装的什么
What's in the bag?

284
00:09:55,489 --> 00:09:57,024
- 你想知道吗  - 嗯
- Do you want to know? - Uh-huh.

285
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:59,559
这包里的土豆沙拉
Well, the potato salad is in the bag

286
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,161
你只能在旧金山才买得到
that you can only get in San Francisco,

287
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:02,930
更不用说我为什么大老远从旧金山
which is why I came from San Francisco

288
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:05,565
跑过来拿给你了
to give it to you,not to mention...

289
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:07,033
- 哇哦  - 对
- Ooh. - Yeah.

290
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:09,302
这排骨都还是热的呢   烫烫烫
The ribs that are hot,hot, hot, hot, hot.

291
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:11,371
哦~ 让我闻闻  快让我闻闻
Oh, let me smell them.Let me smell.

292
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:12,639
嗯~~
Mm.

293
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,774
因为我非常爱您  我还给你特别带了酱料
And because I love you,I got you extra sauce.

294
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:15,942
哦  还有酱料
Oh, the extra sauce.

295
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:17,043
我们现在就吃  行吗
Let's eat it now, shall we?

296
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:18,177
- 好吧  行  - 太好了
- Okay, yeah. - Okay.

297
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:21,114
- 我也想试试这个  - 哦  轻点喷
- I want to try this though. - Oh, easy.

298
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:22,615
- 真恶心   - 对啊
- Ew. - Yeah.

299
00:10:22,616 --> 00:10:24,583
那天的芭蕾舞课程上的如何了
So, hey, how was ballet class the other day?

300
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:26,719
- 非常棒  - 是吗
- Um, it was good. - It was?

301
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,921
非常非常棒
Yeah, it was actually really good.

302
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:30,623
- 真的很棒啊   - 对
- Oh, it was really good. - Yeah.

303
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:32,258
那你最喜欢这课哪一点
What's the thing you like best about it?

304
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:35,161
我喜欢从外婆房顶上把小妹给扔下去
I like when we drop the baby off at grandma's house.

305
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:36,729
嗯   她可不算个舞者
Yeah, she's not much of a dancer.

306
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,464
她更像是个流口水的家伙
She's more of a drooler really, huh?

307
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:40,899
- 对啊  - 你还喜欢什么
- Yeah. - What else you like about it?

308
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,067
哦
Ooh!

309
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:44,270
老妈跟我之后还吃了汉堡跟馅饼
Mom and I get to have burger and pie after.

310
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:45,937
她让我随便点我想吃的东西
She lets me order whatever I want

311
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:47,973
因为她说芭蕾是个非常棒的运动
because ballet's such a good exercise.

312
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:49,608
嗯
Mm.

313
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:51,644
要有汉堡跟馅饼的话  我也去跳芭蕾
Yeah, I'd even do ballet for burger and pie.

314
00:10:51,645 --> 00:10:52,944
你得朝前看了
You have to move forward.

315
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:54,280
- 好吧  - 这就对了
- Oh, okay. - There you go.

316
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:56,248
小鬼  你要是只是为了吃汉堡跟馅饼
You know, buddy,if you're just doing ballet

317
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:58,483
才去跳芭蕾的话
so you can spend time with mom and eat at burger and pie

318
00:10:58,484 --> 00:10:59,985
我会帮你保密的
I won't tell her.

319
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:01,552
我只是好奇是不是...
You know, I'm just curious if that's...

320
00:11:01,553 --> 00:11:04,389
不  老爸  我真的很喜欢跳芭蕾
No, dad.I really like ballet.

321
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,324
- 真的吗  - 真的
- Really? - Yeah.

322
00:11:06,325 --> 00:11:09,795
其实我觉得我爱上跳芭蕾了
Actually, I think I love it.

323
00:11:09,796 --> 00:11:11,462
- 砰  - 你爱跳芭蕾吗
- Boom! - You love it?

324
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,598
你喜欢...下蹲吗
Do your--do, like, a plie.

325
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:15,966
- 做你的...  - 下蹲吗  怎么蹲
- Do your--  - Do a plie? What?

326
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,402
就像这样
Yeah, like this.

327
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:18,703
这样有用吗
How is that gonna help?

328
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:20,171
我懂了  再低点
I got you.Oh, lower.

329
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:21,706
- 转移你的重心  - 嗯
- Move your center of gravity. - Yeah.

330
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:23,274
我告诉过你这会奏效的
I told you it's perfect.

331
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:25,543
这真是...它们真就这样长起来了诶
This is--yeah,they're really coming along.

332
00:11:25,544 --> 00:11:28,645
那肥料真是神奇啊
Incredible with that fertilizer.

333
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,915
- 不好意思   明基朵老师  - 哦  嗨
- Excuse me, Miss Mikindoe. - Oh, hi.

334
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,649
嗨
Hi.

335
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,484
我知道我们周五才能面谈
I know we have a meeting on the books for Friday

336
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,154
你肯定也不希望在校外跟我谈
and you probably don't want to speak out of school but--

337
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,023
- 我真的不能现在跟你聊  - 哦
- well, no, I can't. - Oh.

338
00:11:39,024 --> 00:11:40,825
我是说  周五这个时间很好
I mean,Friday is the best time.

339
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,659
伊万校长也能来
Principal Evans will be there.

340
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,195
对  我知道  我知道
Right.I know, I know.

341
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:46,963
要是你能给我个
If you could give me anything--

342
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:50,400
就一点小小的提示...
just a little heads up on...

343
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:52,736
- 我真的不能  - 好吧
- I really can't. - Okay.

344
00:11:52,737 --> 00:11:54,838
- 好吧  - 哦...
- Okay. - Oh--

345
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,274
我现在都为这事儿夜不能寐了
I can't sleep.

346
00:11:58,275 --> 00:12:00,377
我...
I'm...

347
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:02,312
不知道我儿子到底发生了什么事
I'm really having a rough time

348
00:12:02,313 --> 00:12:04,214
让我日子真不好过
not knowing what's happening with my son.

349
00:12:04,215 --> 00:12:07,283
我现在成天都想着这事儿  所以...
It's kind of all I'm thinking about, so, um...

350
00:12:07,284 --> 00:12:10,019
这件是真的该由校长亲口来说的
This really should come from the principal.

351
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,456
什么  到底是什么事
What?Well, what is it?

352
00:12:13,457 --> 00:12:15,458
我知道你一直都很努力
Well, I know you've been working really hard

353
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:17,960
但是他现在真是越来越落后了
and he just keeps falling more and more behind.

354
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:19,228
好吧
Right.

355
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:20,830
我们不想让他
We don't want himto fall anymore behind

356
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:22,130
再继续落后下去了
than he already is.

357
00:12:22,131 --> 00:12:23,566
- 嗯  - 我们想让他成功
- Right. - We want him to succeed.

358
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,934
好吧  那...
Right.So...

359
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:27,770
所以我们建议让他
So we're recommending that he move back

360
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:30,740
今年余下的时间会四年级去念书
to the fourth grade for the rest of the year.

361
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:32,941
- 好吧  - 我很抱歉
- Okay. - I'm sorry.

362
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:35,510
- 我真的很抱歉  - 不
- I'm really sorry. - No.

363
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:37,312
我知道这样做有多难
I know how hard this is gonna be.

364
00:12:37,313 --> 00:12:39,181
我很抱歉  我本不该跟你说这些的
I'm sorry.I shouldn't have said anything.

365
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:41,783
我应该等到跟校长见了面再跟你说的
I should have waited until we were with the principal.

366
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:43,385
我很感激你能告诉我这些
Oh, I really appreciate you telling me.

367
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:44,753
谢谢你
Thank you.

368
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:46,454
- 一切都会好起来的  - 好吧
- It's gonna be okay. - Okay.

369
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:47,756
好了  我们周五再见
All right, I'll see you Friday.

370
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:48,991
- 好吧  - 好吧
- Okay. - Okay.

371
00:12:48,992 --> 00:12:50,992
拜
Bye.

372
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:06,274
我知道我什么都搞砸过
So I know I suck at pretty much everything,

373
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:08,309
但幸好这个南瓜没有
but apparently not squash.

374
00:13:12,114 --> 00:13:15,082
茱莉亚  怎么啦
Julia, what's wrong?

375
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,284
你还好吗  出什么事了
Are you okay? What happened?

376
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:17,785
嗯
Mm.

377
00:13:17,786 --> 00:13:19,253
天呐
Oh, God.

378
00:13:19,254 --> 00:13:22,823
他们终于还是要让维克多留级到四年级
They're finally moving Victor back to fourth grade now.

379
00:13:22,824 --> 00:13:25,726
我现在不知道怎么办了
And...I don't know.

380
00:13:25,727 --> 00:13:30,397
天呐  我很遗憾 真的很遗憾
God, I'm sorry, Julia. I am.

381
00:13:34,402 --> 00:13:36,136
我都不知道要怎么告诉他了
I don't know how to tell him.

382
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:44,210
天呐
Oh, God.

383
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,694
我要...
I'm gonna...

384
00:14:01,695 --> 00:14:05,932
我要跟我老公讲这事儿
Um, go talk to my husband.

385
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:07,800
- 嗯  - 好吧
- Yeah. - Okay.

386
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:09,134
- 谢谢你   - 你真还好吗
- Thank you. - You okay?

387
00:14:09,135 --> 00:14:10,503
嗯  我还好
Okay, yeah. I'm okay.

388
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:22,961
- 嘿  布伦达  最近如何  - 嘿  克里斯蒂娜
- Hey, Brenda. How are you? - Hey, Kristina.

389
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,730
- 嘿  你还好吗  - 对了  他现在在打电话
- Hey, how are you doing?- Oh, he's on a call right now.

390
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,199
没关系  我就耽搁他几分钟
Oh, it's okay.It'll just take a second.

391
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,933
- 你不能进去  克里斯蒂娜  - 就几分钟时间
- You can't go in thereChristina.- Just one quick second.

392
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,202
没事的  没什么大事儿
It's fine.It's really no big deal.

393
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,637
- 就耽搁一会儿  - 克里斯蒂娜  你好吗
- It'll be two seconds.- Kristina! How are you?

394
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,105
我好得不得了  鲍勃  你呢
I'm great, Bob.How are you?

395
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,907
- 想来杯咖啡吗  - 不想
- You want a coffee?- No, I don't want a coffee.

396
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,342
我什么都不想喝  听着
I don't want anything.Listen to me.

397
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:37,677
我想让你承认
I just want you to tell me straight

398
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:39,411
亚当那件事是你捅出去的  别拐弯抹角
that this story about Adam came from you.

399
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,814
- 我知道是你干的  - 别这样
- I know that it did. - Come on.

400
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,548
我简直不敢相信你会做出这种事
I can't believe that you would do this.

401
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,883
我本以为我们俩是朋友
I mean,I thought we were friends.

402
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,484
我对你干什么事儿了  你就不敢相信
You can't believe I would do what to you?

403
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,954
这完全是对我们俩友谊的背叛
This is a complete betrayal of our friendship

404
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,522
背叛  等等  克里斯蒂娜
Betrayal?Kristina, hold on a second.

405
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,424
不要  我才不要等等  我现在非常愤怒
No, I'm not gonna hold on.I'm actually pissed.

406
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,026
竞选本来就有点污秽不堪
Campaigns get a little messy,Kristina.

407
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,660
我都懂  我知道
I get it.I know that.

408
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,829
要是你知道的话  那还为什么要跑到这儿来大吼大叫
Well, if you know that,then why are you here yelling--

409
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,198
我才是那个竞选的人  不是我的家人
I'm the one running,Bob, not my family.

410
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,567
- 这我完全理解  - 别把他们给卷进来  行吗
- I completely understand that.
- Leave them out of it,okay?

411
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,337
你听懂了吗  你知道什么吗
Do you get that?You know what,

412
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:06,904
我手上一样也有你不为人知的事儿
there are some things that I could share

413
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:09,207
别逼我告诉公众  你...
about you, Bob, that...

414
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,976
继续说啊  克里斯蒂娜
Go ahead, Kristina.

415
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,377
但是你根本就不会说什么
But you're not gonna say anything

416
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:14,979
因为你根本就不是那样的人
'cause that's just not who you are.

417
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,314
否则的话  我两年前也就会赢得那场选举
Otherwise,I would have won that campaign two years ago.

418
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:20,417
但这次我绝对不会输
But I'm not gonna lose this one.

419
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:22,419
你一点都不了解我的为人
You don't know who I am.

420
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,088
一点都不
No idea.

421
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,456
一点都不
Not a clue.

422
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,358
你真该去看看他当时的那副嘴脸
You should have seen the little look on his face.

423
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,025
- 他对着我得意的笑  我真想当时就...  - 我知道
- He was smirking at me.I want to,like..- I know.

424
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:30,427
冲上去狠狠揍他一顿
I wanted to punch him.

425
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:32,028
他知道我不会对他使阴招
He knows that I can't go negative on this.

426
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:33,430
他在跟你玩心理战呢
He's playing mind games with you.

427
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,031
他在跟我玩心理战
He's playing mind games with me.

428
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:36,333
你得证明他错了  好吗
You got to prove him wrong,okay?

429
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:37,534
我该怎么做才能证明他错了
How am I gonna prove him wrong?

430
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:39,002
在不提及安博的情况下给他狠狠一击
With the way doing it without mentioning Amber's name.

431
00:15:39,003 --> 00:15:41,004
- 那要怎么做  亲爱的  - 小鲍
- How, honey?- Bob little.

432
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:43,140
跟实习生乱搞关系  就这样就行
Inappropriate behavior with an intern and that's it.

433
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:44,675
我不想把安博给卷进来
I don't want to bring Amber into this.

434
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:45,876
- 这件事太私人了  - 我们不会把安博给卷进来的
- It's like--it's too personal.
- We won't bring Amber into this.

435
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:47,277
她是我的家人  是我的侄女
She's family.She's my niece.

436
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:49,312
我觉得应该让海瑟来衡量这件事儿
I think that we should have Heather weigh in on this.

437
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:50,613
我绝对不会跟海瑟说这件事儿
I am not checking with Heather.

438
00:15:50,614 --> 00:15:52,482
我要是我告诉她安博跟鲍勃的事  就什么都完蛋了
If I tell her about Amber and Bob, it's over.

439
00:15:52,483 --> 00:15:53,516
你已经见识过她得厉害了  不是吗
You've met her, okay?

440
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:54,985
她一定会直击要害
She'll go right for the jugular--

441
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:57,020
我不想成为导致你竞选事业结束的引子
I just don't want to be the reason this ends for you.

442
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:59,990
我不会输的
I'm not going to lose.

443
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:01,291
我绝对不会输的
I'm not losing.

444
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:02,825
我就喜欢你被激怒的样子
I love it when you get feisty like that.

445
00:16:02,826 --> 00:16:04,827
- 我没有被激怒好吗  我只是有点生气而已  - 那只是...
- I'm not feisty.I'm just mad.- The one that just--

446
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:06,228
我要下楼去处理这件事儿了
I'm going downstairs to fix this.

447
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:07,697
你决定怎么做了吗
What'd you decide?

448
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:10,032
亲爱的
Honey?

449
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,367
- 嘿  - 嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

450
00:16:11,368 --> 00:16:13,303
- 看到你的留言了  - 我帮你接收红酒包裹
- Got you note.- I got your wine delivery.

451
00:16:13,304 --> 00:16:14,737
谢谢
Thank you.

452
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:16,306
这酒据说非常赞的
This is supposed to be an amazing label.

453
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:17,774
是吗
Oh, yeah?

454
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:19,775
他们告诉我的是这是非常香的果酒
I'm told it's fruit-forward with a very big nose.

455
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:21,243
- 对我来说什么酒都一样  - 你要来吗
- It's all the same to me. - You coming?

456
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:23,679
我嘛...
Oh, I--you know...

457
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,515
你是房客  而我是你的房东  我不...
You're the tenant.I'm your super. I don't...

458
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:28,117
我知道你认为这会是
I know you think it's gonna be, you know,

459
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:30,052
一帮二十多岁的年轻人的狂欢
me and a bunch of 20-something's doing shooters,

460
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:32,121
但我确实还是有一些三十多的朋友来参加
but I do have some friends in their 30s.

461
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:33,956
四十多岁的都有呢
Even their 40s.

462
00:16:33,957 --> 00:16:35,924
不许告诉别人
Don't tell anybody.

463
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:37,793
谢了  但我家里确实还有点事儿
Thanks, but I have a family thing.

464
00:16:37,794 --> 00:16:40,729
好吧  谢谢你帮我拿包裹
Okay.Thanks for hanging onto it.

465
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,798
应该的
Sure.

466
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,766
对了  萨拉
Hey, Sarah?

467
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:46,868
管它那么多呢
You know,for what it's worth...

468
00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:49,738
就算你周六的派对不想来
Even if you don't want to come to my party Saturday,

469
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:51,239
你还是应该去参加别的派对的
you should go to a party.

470
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,509
像你这个年纪的女人周六晚上就该出去玩
Yeah,a woman like you should be out on Saturday night.

471
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:02,851
我认为大家都觉得暴力手段
Well,I think we can all agree that resorting to violence

472
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:04,552
不是正确的家庭价值观
is not a family value.

473
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:06,787
真正的家庭价值观应该是...
I think this is really about moving...

474
00:17:06,788 --> 00:17:08,856
- 天呐  我怎么就没想到呢  - 出什么事儿了
- Boy, have I seen it.- What's happening?

475
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:10,891
我就是觉得这种行径太恶心了  你知道吗
I am just disgusted.You know what?

476
00:17:10,892 --> 00:17:12,926
我简直不敢相信他会做出这种事
I can't believe that he would do this.

477
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:14,662
安博  我也不敢相信  我只是...
Amber, I can't either.I'm just--

478
00:17:14,663 --> 00:17:16,464
我现在都快愁死了  你知道吗
I'm so bummed, you know?

479
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:18,165
我觉得好像...
Like, I feel like...

480
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,300
我还以为他怎么都还是个不错的家伙
I thought he was,like, a good guy generally.

481
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:22,370
我们曾经是朋友啊  我们是朋友啊
We were friends, you know? We're friends.

482
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:26,340
我现在觉得好像被背叛了一样
I just feel, like,totally betrayed and...

483
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:29,209
- 这样太糟了  - 我已经厌倦了
- It's so awful.- I'm just tired and...

484
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,644
- 我也说不清楚  - 你知道我们该怎么做
- I don't know.- You know what we have to do.

485
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:33,347
我...
I...

486
00:17:33,348 --> 00:17:35,215
- 你敢  - 你必须这样做
- Don't you dare. - You have to.

487
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:36,750
- 好吗  - 你知道我们别无他法
- Okay? - You know that there's no way--

488
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:39,019
你亚当舅舅已经跟我谈过这件事儿了
Uncle Adam and I have been talking about this

489
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,687
他一直在问我...
and he's been asking--

490
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:42,422
- 很好  很好呀  - 一点都不好
- Good. Good. - No, it's not good.

491
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:44,791
- 我不想把你卷进来  - 没关系的
- I'm not pulling you into this. - It doesn't matter.

492
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:47,059
我们在有这件把柄的时候
There's no way that we can let him get away with this--

493
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,529
绝对不能让他就这么侥幸逃脱
with spinning something like what Uncle did

494
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,131
他对亚当舅舅的所作所为
into this when we have this on him.

495
00:17:52,132 --> 00:17:54,033
- 我知道我们有这件把柄 但是 - 这样做一点都没错
- I know we have it, but, honey,
- It's the right thing to do.

496
00:17:54,034 --> 00:17:55,635
你也会暴露在媒体之下的
you would be all over the media.

497
00:17:55,636 --> 00:17:57,803
- 不管你是在工作还是回家 还是做其他事 - 没关系的
- They would be following you.- That's fine.

498
00:17:57,804 --> 00:17:59,738
-  他们都会一直跟着你的- 我自会处理的
- To work, home, everything.- I can handle it.

499
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:01,207
我不想这种家伙当选
I don't want this guy in office.

500
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,441
- 我知道  -他太不诚信了
- I know. - He's dishonest.

501
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:04,043
我也不想  我会好好考虑这件事的
I don't either,but I'll think about it.

502
00:18:04,044 --> 00:18:05,878
你答应我你真会考虑
Do you promise you'll think about it for real?

503
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:07,013
我发誓  我向你保证
I swear I will.I promise.

504
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:08,547
- 你保证  - 我们拉钩为誓
- Do you promise. - I pinkie promise...

505
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:10,316
- 拉钩  - 我会好好考虑的
- Pinkie promise. - That I'll think about it.

506
00:18:10,317 --> 00:18:12,118
等...等等
What--wait.

507
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:14,085
- 那是什么  - 你还没见过吗
- What is that? - You haven't seen it?

508
00:18:14,086 --> 00:18:15,954
天呐  简直是
Oh, my God.That is, like--

509
00:18:15,955 --> 00:18:19,124
我看不见了  亲爱的  这真是太棒了
I can't see.Honey, that is so pretty.

510
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:22,561
- 嗯  对  - 太浪漫了
- Yeah, it's--yeah. - Oh, how sweet.

511
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:24,029
- 哦~~  -对啊
- Oh. - Yeah.

512
00:18:25,331 --> 00:18:28,366
你不喜欢吗
You don't really love it?

513
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:30,201
有点荒唐  对吧
It's a little bit absurd,right?

514
00:18:30,202 --> 00:18:31,636
不只是我
It's not just me?

515
00:18:31,637 --> 00:18:33,571
我是说  它比我们家任何一个人
I mean, it's bigger than any

516
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:36,241
的婚戒都还要大
of my family members wedding rings, I mean--

517
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:37,943
确实是比我的要大些  但是...
well, it's a little bigger than mine, but...

518
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:39,377
我们到底在干嘛呢
Like,what are we doing?

519
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:41,512
- 好好享受它吧  好吗  - 我不需要这个
- Enjoy it, you know? - I don't need it.

520
00:18:41,513 --> 00:18:43,481
他把他所有的钱都花上面了
And he spent all of his money on it.

521
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:45,783
倾家荡产了都
Everything that he had.

522
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:47,718
你们俩就要结婚了  你知道吗
You guys are gonna be married.You know what?

523
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:49,253
跟他谈谈  告诉他
Have this talk with him and tell him

524
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:52,457
你在担心财政问题  而且可能...
that you're worried about finances and maybe just...

525
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,825
- 我很害怕呀  - 告诉他就对了
- I'm just scared. - Just tell him.

526
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:55,560
我怕伤了他的心
I don't want to hurt his feelings.

527
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:58,696
我觉得他会非常沮丧的
I feel like he's gonna get upset.

528
00:18:58,697 --> 00:19:02,132
你确定只是因为这戒指的事儿
Are you sure it's just about the ring?

529
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:03,467
- 对  - 好吧
- Yeah. - Oh, okay.

530
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:06,403
对  我们一切都还好  我只是... 还好
Yeah, everything's fine.I just... Yeah.

531
00:19:06,404 --> 00:19:09,039
很好
Good.

532
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:17,047
好了  他们都在做家庭作业了
Okay, they're both doing homework.

533
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:21,250
- 好吧  - 好吧
- Okay. - Okay.

534
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:23,620
我说对了  他们要让他留级了
I was right.They're gonna hold him back.

535
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:26,289
你从哪知道...
And you know this...

536
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,225
我今天偶遇到明基朵老师了  她跟我说的
I ran into Miss Mikindoe today at school and she told me.

537
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:31,160
- 偶遇吗  - 所以 ...对
- Ran into? - So... Yeah.

538
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:32,529
我在那弄责任委员会的事儿
I was there for sustainability.

539
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,397
所以你就情不自禁了
And you just couldn't help yourself.

540
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:35,699
乔
Joel.

541
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,533
我是说  你就不能打电话给我
I mean, you can't call me about this,

542
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:39,469
- 或是给我发短信给我说要讨论一下...- 你之前在工作诶
- or text me have a discussion-- - You were at work.

543
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,703
而且我现在在告诉你啊
And I'm telling you now.

544
00:19:40,704 --> 00:19:42,305
所以你就一个人跑去找明基朵老师
So you went and had our conversation

545
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,273
讨论我们要一起讨论的话题
with Miss Mikindoe without me.

546
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:47,443
我是偶遇到她的  我们能讨论正事儿吗
I ran into her and can we talk about the real issue, here?

547
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:49,445
我们儿子在学年中途的时候
Our son is being yanked out of his class

548
00:19:49,446 --> 00:19:51,580
被赶出原来的班了诶
in the middle of the school year

549
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:53,849
我们得相处怎样去告诉他这件事儿
and we need to figure out how to talk to him about it.

550
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,552
不行  我们不会那样做的
No.We are not doing that.

551
00:19:56,553 --> 00:19:57,987
我觉得我们别无选择
I don't think we have a choice.

552
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,388
我们有  茱莉亚
Yes, we do, Julia.

553
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:00,956
我们要去告诉校长
We're gonna go in and tell the principal

554
00:20:00,957 --> 00:20:02,257
他这样会毁了的
that he can go screw himself.

555
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:03,592
哦
Oh.

556
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:05,160
我们非得现在把他给弄出来吗
We're gonna pull out son out right now?

557
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:06,695
这对他来说是个灾难
It's gonna be a total disaster for him.

558
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:07,696
我知道
I know.

559
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:08,764
这就是我为什么想在学年开始的时候
That's why I wanted to do it

560
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:10,198
就让他留级
at the beginning of the school year.

561
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:12,067
哦  这都是我的错吗  都怪我是吗
Oh, so this is my fault?This is all on me?

562
00:20:12,068 --> 00:20:13,402
- 不是  - 你不就是那样说的吗
- No. - Is that what you're saying?

563
00:20:13,403 --> 00:20:14,903
- 你能...  - 我绝对不会这样对他的
- Can you-- - I am not doing that to him.

564
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:16,138
绝对不会
I am not gonna do that to him.

565
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:17,572
可现实就是如此
It's a situation that we're in now.

566
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:18,740
我们去找个私立学校
We'll find a private school.

567
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:19,908
我们去找个解决的办法
We'll find some sort of way--

568
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:21,609
乔  就靠你的薪水
Joel, we can't afford a private school

569
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,278
我们负担不起私立学校
on just your salary.

570
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,913
- 什么  - 我是就事论事
- What? - I'm being practical.

571
00:20:24,914 --> 00:20:26,814
看看我们的选择  这不是一个可行的选择
Let's look at our options.That's not an option.

572
00:20:26,815 --> 00:20:28,182
- 靠我的薪水   - 靠你的薪水
- On my salary? - On your salary.

573
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:30,785
没人让你辞掉工作  不是吗
Well,no one asked you to go quit your job,did they?

574
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:32,319
但你还是那样做了
But you went and did that.

575
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,321
就跟你跑去跟明基朵老师谈一样
Just like you went and talked to miss Mikindoe.

576
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:36,157
你所做的所有决定
All these decisions you're making,

577
00:20:36,158 --> 00:20:37,926
都是些不好的决定
they're bad decisions.

578
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:39,527
你根本就是在帮倒忙
You're not helping, here.

579
00:20:49,021 --> 00:20:50,853
?滚...出我的草坪
? G-get of my lawn

580
00:20:50,854 --> 00:20:52,555
?滚...滚...滚出我的草坪
? g-g-get off my lawn

581
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:54,323
?什么
? what

582
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:55,691
?滚...滚...滚出我的草坪
? g-g-get off my lawn

583
00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:58,293
?滚...滚...滚出我的草坪
?g-g-get off my lawn

584
00:20:58,294 --> 00:20:59,495
这是首不错的单曲
That's a good single.

585
00:20:59,496 --> 00:21:00,897
你应该在整张专辑出炉之前
You should drop that single first

586
00:21:00,898 --> 00:21:02,297
把这个加进去做第一首单曲
before your whole album comes out.

587
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:03,733
我觉得这不可能
I was afraid this was gonna happen.

588
00:21:03,734 --> 00:21:05,001
都是什么采访啊
What an interview.

589
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,435
我是说“采访”
I mean "interview."

590
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:07,869
我都快忘了你走那个家伙的时候
I forgot what a tough guy you are

591
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,371
是有多男人了
that you punched that guy out.

592
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:12,007
而且他们混音的时候
And then the way they remixed,they really captured

593
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:13,575
他们真的捕捉到你声音中甜蜜的那一点了
this sweet spot of your voice.

594
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:15,877
你现在听自娱自乐的对吧
You're pretty happy with yourself right now,aren't you?

595
00:21:15,878 --> 00:21:17,279
说实话  这真让我挺开心的
Honestly,it really picked me up.

596
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,680
- 啊哈  - 确实是
- Uh-huh. - It did.

597
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:21,150
听着  我在家也挺不顺心的
Look,things aren't perfect for me at home either.

598
00:21:21,151 --> 00:21:28,122
乔巴选了芭蕾做他的冬季运动  而不是篮球
Jabbar chose,over basketball,for his winter sport,ballet.

599
00:21:28,123 --> 00:21:29,991
- 那甚至都不算一项运动  - 挺酷的嘛
- That's not even a sport.Ballet.- That's cool.

600
00:21:29,992 --> 00:21:31,125
- 酷吗  - 对
- It's cool? - Yeah.

601
00:21:31,126 --> 00:21:33,127
- 芭蕾吗  - 有什么问题吗
- Ballet? - What's the problem?

602
00:21:33,128 --> 00:21:34,529
他在家里挺重要的
Well, he was in the outfit.

603
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,831
他拥有整个... 你知道的
He had the whole--you know, he was...

604
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:41,869
就在那个消除房瞎打转
twirling around the kitchen in a super thin, you know...

605
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,472
- 你看到非常不好受吗  - 而我...就给他打下手
- Is it tough--kind of tough for you to see that?
- And I am ...hands.

606
00:21:44,473 --> 00:21:45,706
- 是吗   - 对
- Yeah? -  Yeah.

607
00:21:45,707 --> 00:21:47,908
班里还有其他男生吗
Is there any other guys in the class?

608
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:50,445
- 没有  - 看看那个
- No. - Well, look at that.

609
00:21:50,446 --> 00:21:52,280
看看  他在让男女比例协调呢
Look at that.He's working the ratio, there.

610
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:53,614
班上就他跟一帮女生呢
It's just a bunch of girls and him.

611
00:21:53,615 --> 00:21:55,015
- 他成功的几率很大呢  - 好吧 我...
- He's got it made. - Okay, I-

612
00:21:55,016 --> 00:21:56,584
我才不关心我那才十岁的儿子
I'm not concerned about whether or not

613
00:21:56,585 --> 00:21:58,085
能不能谈到恋爱呢
my 10-year-old's gonna get laid.

614
00:21:58,086 --> 00:22:01,455
我在谈我能跟他分享
I'm talking about being able to share something with him

615
00:22:01,456 --> 00:22:02,756
能跟他一起做的事儿
that I could connect with him on.

616
00:22:02,757 --> 00:22:04,091
我懂了  好吗
I get it, okay?

617
00:22:04,092 --> 00:22:06,159
克罗斯比  你的孩子不会
Crosby,your kids aren't always gonna be interested

618
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,761
总对你感兴趣的东西感兴趣
in the things that you're interested in.

619
00:22:07,762 --> 00:22:09,329
他们也不会总如你所愿
They're not always gonna be interested

620
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,864
成为你想让他们成为的人
in the things you want them to be,okay?

621
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:13,133
我也希望麦克斯能对篮球
I wish that Max had been more interested

622
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:14,601
比对虫子感兴趣一点儿
in baseball than bugs.

623
00:22:14,602 --> 00:22:16,002
但这不是我能掌控得了的
That's not how it worked out.

624
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:19,106
好吗  所以我也对虫子感起了兴趣
Okay? So I got interested in bugs.

625
00:22:19,107 --> 00:22:21,108
嗯哼
Mmhmm.

626
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:25,312
嘿  小鬼  维克多呢
Hey, bud, where's Victor?

627
00:22:25,313 --> 00:22:26,913
他去外边玩去了
Uh, he's outside playing.

628
00:22:26,914 --> 00:22:29,148
他说天做完作业了
He said he finished his homework.

629
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:32,051
哦
Oh.

630
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:34,087
好吧
Okay.

631
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:35,387
那你呢
How about you?

632
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:37,223
你选好你要做的任务了吗
Have you chosen which mission you're gonna do?

633
00:22:37,224 --> 00:22:39,325
选好了  圣胡安・卡皮斯特拉诺
Yeah, the San Juan capistrano.

634
00:22:39,326 --> 00:22:41,594
你知道每年有多少燕子飞往那里吗
You know the swallows fly there every year?

635
00:22:41,595 --> 00:22:42,996
我知道诶
I did know that.

636
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:44,530
你外公外婆在我小的时候
Grandma and grandpa took me down there

637
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:45,664
带我去过哪儿
when I was a kid.

638
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:48,000
非常酷的
Pretty cool.

639
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:49,502
好吧
Okay.

640
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:51,837
- 妈咪  - 什么事
- Mommy? - Yeah?

641
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,705
要是维克多留级到四年级了
If Victor goes back to fourth grade,

642
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,842
他得做另外一份任务报告吗
will he had to do another missions report?

643
00:22:56,843 --> 00:22:58,477
不会
No.

644
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:00,112
不会  他做过了
No, he did that.

645
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:03,581
所以...
So...

646
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,217
天呐  我不...
Gosh, I don't--um...

647
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,719
我不知道
I don't know.

648
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,755
你没跟他说这事对吧
Hey,you haven't talked to him about that,have you?

649
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:11,289
- 我没有  - 很好
- No, I haven't. - Good.

650
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,493
因为我们现在还没决定好
Because nothing's been decided yet, so...

651
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,997
这件事儿非常复杂  你知道吗
It's just--it's complicated, you know?

652
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,066
对所有成年人来说都是
It's for all the grown-ups.

653
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,001
得要学校跟维克多的老师
It's for the school and for Victor's teachers

654
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:29,541
还有我跟你爸爸一起解决
and for daddy and I to figure out.

655
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:32,977
好吗
Okay?

656
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,979
- 好吧  - 好吧
- Okay. - Okay.

657
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:40,450
这就是你昨天跟老爸吵架吵得那么晚的原因吗
Is that why you and daddy have been fighting so much lately?

658
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,722
没有  我们才没有吵架呢
No, we haven't been fighting.

659
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:52,829
没有  宝贝
No, sweetie, um, you know,

660
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,265
只是有时候有些分歧而已
sometimes we just disagree,

661
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:58,068
但都没事了
but that's--that's okay.

662
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:02,772
我们讨论...
And we discuss things and...

663
00:24:09,646 --> 00:24:11,848
你好  米勒先生
Hello, Mr. Miller.

664
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:13,349
对  我是克里斯蒂娜・布雷弗曼竞选团队
Yes, this is Adam Braverman calling

665
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,686
的亚当・布雷弗曼
from the Kristina Braverman campaign.

666
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:18,621
对  我们想问一下你
Yes, we're calling to ask you if you'd be willing

667
00:24:18,622 --> 00:24:20,223
愿意为了让竞选更具竞争性进行
to make a second donation to help

00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,524

00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:24,760
但是我们还可以要高点儿
But we could go higher.

671
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:26,295
但要是你赞助1000美元就再好不过了
But $1,000 would be even better.

672

682
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:43,378
你们简直是疯了
You guys look insane.

683
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:44,579
你们在吼谁呢
Who are you yelling at?

684
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,814
那么看起来跟个疯子似的
You look like lunatics.

685
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:47,449
海蒂足球比赛的脸书首页
Haddie's soccer Facebook page.

686
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,551
- 这就是那时候的照片  - 这是场足球赛吗
- That's where that's from. - This was a soccer game?

687
00:24:49,552 --> 00:24:50,786
他从网上弄下来的
He took it from the Internet.

688
00:24:50,787 --> 00:24:52,287
裁判员判她失误
The ref called her for tripping.

689
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:53,588
她正在带球过人
She was making a play on the ball.

690
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:55,423
我简直不敢相信  他怎么能截下这么一张图
I can't believe--how can he just grab this stuff

691
00:24:55,424 --> 00:24:56,925
还把它放到报纸上呢
and have it be in the paper?

692
00:24:56,926 --> 00:24:58,860
- 因为他是个混蛋  - 这就是他的伎俩
- Because he's a jerk.- That's how he could od this.

693
00:24:58,861 --> 00:25:00,295
我们得召开记者招待会
We need to call a press conference.

694
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:01,463
- 我觉得我必须这么做了  - 你应该这么做
- I feel that's what I have to do.

700
00:25:10,873 --> 00:25:12,073
就让他住手
Just tell him to stop it.

701
00:25:12,074 --> 00:25:13,575
你们有事瞒着我
You're not telling me something.

702
00:25:13,576 --> 00:25:16,677
克里斯蒂娜  你是不是手上有那家伙什么把柄
Kristina, you got something on this guy?

703
00:25:21,449 --> 00:25:22,683
我喜欢这个  你喜欢吗
I liked it.Did you like it?

704
00:25:22,684 --> 00:25:25,452
- 我觉得还不错诶  - 嗯哼
- I thought it was good. - Mmhmm.

705
00:25:25,453 --> 00:25:28,355
对  很好
Yeah, it was good.

706
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:29,791
这是什么
What's this?

707
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:31,858
- 什么  - 你为什么把它转过来戴
- What? - Why you twiddling it?

708
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:34,595
- 我不知道啦 - 太大了吗
- I don't know. - Is it too big.

709
00:25:34,596 --> 00:25:35,862
- 不是  - 那我们重新打一下尺寸
- No. - Let's get it resized.

710
00:25:35,863 --> 00:25:37,331
不不不  不是那个原因
No, no, no, it's not that.It's not.

711
00:25:37,332 --> 00:25:39,633
没关系的  他们说我可以把它送回去的
It really doesn't matter.They said I could bring it back.

712
00:25:39,634 --> 00:25:41,635
- 不是那个原因  - 确实太大了
- It's not that. - It is too big.

713
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:46,206
- 我有个主意  - 什么主意
- I had an idea. - What?

714
00:25:46,207 --> 00:25:48,074
我觉得我们可以一起讨论
I thought we could talk about it together.

715
00:25:48,075 --> 00:25:50,777
- 好吧  - 嗯...
- Okay. - Um...

716
00:25:50,778 --> 00:25:55,982
我一直停不住去想这戒指有多贵
I can't--I can't stop thinking about how much money it was.

717
00:25:55,983 --> 00:25:57,417
- 你能不去想吗  - 太贵重了
- Will you stop? - It was so much.

718
00:25:57,418 --> 00:26:00,353
- 这可是花了你所有的退伍津贴  - 你能别说了吗
- It was all of your combat pay. - Will you stop?

719
00:26:00,354 --> 00:26:02,856
我想让你拥有它  你值得拥有
I want you to have it.You're worth it.

720
00:26:02,857 --> 00:26:04,457
这就是我想把钱花在的地方
This is what I wanted to spend my money on.

721
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:05,625
这是件特别的事儿
This is a special thing.

722
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:07,059
但是  宝贝  这正是我在跟你说的
But, baby, that's what I'm saying.

723
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,662
这并不是我不喜欢这段感情
And it's not that I don't love that sentiment,

724
00:26:09,663 --> 00:26:12,231
正是因为我太爱了  但这似乎
because I do, but it's kind of like

725
00:26:12,232 --> 00:26:14,099
就是我们的所有家当了  所以我...
it's our money now,and so I--

726
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,069
我想讨论出最好的花钱方式
I wanted to talk about what the best way to spend it is

727
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,205
因为万一我们想去旅游呢
because, like, what if we want to travel?

728
00:26:19,206 --> 00:26:20,639
要是我们想...
What if we want to...

729
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,441
要是我们想组建一个家庭买套房子呢
What if we want to start a family or get a house?

730
00:26:22,442 --> 00:26:23,709
难道我们...
Like, don't we--

731
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,610
这些都会有的
well, then...All those things are gonna come.

732
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:27,046
我们不可能一口就吃个大胖子
We're not gonna get them all at once.

733
00:26:27,047 --> 00:26:28,814
但这个戒指将会是你
But this is something that you're gonna have

734
00:26:28,815 --> 00:26:30,615
接下来生活的每一天
for the rest of your life and you're gonna wear

735
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:32,651
都要戴在身上的
on your finger every single day.

736
00:26:32,652 --> 00:26:34,786
我想让你感到特别
And I want you to feel special and I don't want you to have

737
00:26:34,787 --> 00:26:36,288
我不想让你戴一枚廉价的戒指
some cheap ring that's not gonna--

738
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:38,189
但是  宝贝  要是我们买一枚更小
but, baby, I would feel just as special

739
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,960
的戒指我一样会感觉很特别
and love something a little smaller just as much

740
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:43,528
而且我们还能省下钱来
if it felt like we wanted to maybe save

741
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:45,063
去做别的事儿
some of that money for something else.

742
00:26:45,064 --> 00:26:47,065
这就是我想征求你的意见的事儿
That's all I wanted to get your opinion on.

743
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:48,299
我... 好吧  好吧
I, uh--yeah, yeah.

744
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,868
我们把它还回去换一枚...
We'll bring it back and trade it in and--

745
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:51,703
等等  宝贝  你还好吗
well, wait, babe,I wanted--do you feel good?

746
00:26:51,704 --> 00:26:53,071
我是说  这让你觉得有意义吗
I mean, does that make you sense?

747
00:26:53,072 --> 00:26:55,240
你想省点钱去做别的事儿吗
Do you want to save some of that money for something else?

748
00:26:55,241 --> 00:26:57,008
当然  肯定很有意义
Yeah.It makes perfect sense.

749
00:26:57,009 --> 00:26:58,576
- 没什么大不了的  - 瑞恩  你生气了吗
- It's no big deal. - Ryan, are you upset?

750
00:26:58,577 --> 00:26:59,844
- 我爱你  - 我也爱你
- I love you. - No. I love you too.

751
00:26:59,845 --> 00:27:01,479
这没什么大不了的
It's not a big deal.

752
00:27:06,266 --> 00:27:08,199
你要吃水果圈了还兴奋吗
Are you excited to eat fruit loops?

753
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,300
你在数着日子
Are you counting down the days

754
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:10,401
看你什么时候能吃水果圈吗
so that you can eat fruit loops?

755
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:14,772
- 早上好  亲爱的  - 早上好
- Good morning, my love.- Good morning.

756
00:27:14,773 --> 00:27:16,974
嗨
Hi.

757
00:27:16,975 --> 00:27:18,676
哇哦  你看起来心情很好嘛
Wow, you look like you're in a good mood.

758
00:27:18,677 --> 00:27:20,111
是的  我心情很好
I am. I am.

759
00:27:20,112 --> 00:27:22,346
我非常喜欢跟乔巴一块儿上课
I just love these classes with jabbar.

760
00:27:22,347 --> 00:27:24,749
我是说  我只是不想惹你不高兴
I mean, I'm trying not to jinx it, you know?

761
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,317
但他好像真的爱上了芭蕾
But it seems like he's really into it.

762
00:27:27,318 --> 00:27:29,319
我们之间肯定有什么特殊的联系
You know--you know,we might have something.

763
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,623
对  感觉家里好像有了个小巴雷什尼科夫
Yeah, like a little baryshnikov on our hands.

764
00:27:32,624 --> 00:27:35,126
对  小巴雷什尼科夫
Yeah, a little baryshnikov.

765
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:36,793
怎么啦  难道这样说不好吗
What?Isn't that a good one?

766
00:27:36,794 --> 00:27:38,195
这样说是很好啦
That's a great one,

767
00:27:38,196 --> 00:27:40,631
但我知道你其实并不喜欢这样  所以...
but I know you're not really cool with it, so...

768
00:27:40,632 --> 00:27:42,766
不不不 我才没有不高兴呢
No, no, I'm not not cool with it.

769
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:44,067
- 真的吗  - 对
- Really? - Yeah.

770
00:27:44,068 --> 00:27:46,903
我是说  我...
I mean, I'm...

771
00:27:46,904 --> 00:27:49,506
我不是在说我希望他
It wouldn't have been,say,my dream pick

772
00:27:49,507 --> 00:27:51,808
去学芭蕾  而不是去骑肌肉车
that he was into ballet over, say,

773
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:53,176
摩托车什么的
muscle cars and motorcycles,

774
00:27:53,177 --> 00:27:54,610
但是  你知道的  我不...
but, you know, I'm not,like, hung up

775
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:57,513
会对男子气概子类的事儿而不安
on the masculinity of it all or anything.

776
00:27:57,514 --> 00:27:58,948
- 好吧  - 嗯
- Okay. - Yeah.

777
00:27:58,949 --> 00:28:00,850
很好  因为你根本不必担心
Good, 'cause you really don't need to worry.

778
00:28:00,851 --> 00:28:02,451
他还是你的儿子
He's still gonna be your boy.

779
00:28:02,452 --> 00:28:04,788
你非常男子气概的儿子  好吗
Your very boyish boy, okay?

780
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:06,455
好吧  你为什么一直粘着我
Okay, why are you getting sticky with me?

781
00:28:06,456 --> 00:28:08,024
- 我才没有一直粘着你呢  - 快点  老妈
- I'm not sticky with you.- Come on, mom.

782
00:28:08,025 --> 00:28:09,458
- 走啦  - 好吧  好吧  好吧
- Let's go. - Okay, okay, okay, okay.

783
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:11,160
拜  艾达
Bye, aida.

784
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:12,961
- 跟你哥哥说再见  - 再见  老爸
- Say bye to your brother. - Bye, daddy.

785
00:28:12,962 --> 00:28:14,463
祝你跳芭蕾愉快
Hey, have fun at ballet.

786
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,332
- 好吧  - 下蹲努力点
- Okay. - Plie hard.

787
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:17,900
踢高一点
And kick high.

788
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:19,535
- 爱你哟  - 但得先做好准备运动
- Love you. - Limber up first.

789
00:28:19,536 --> 00:28:21,103
快点  老妈  走了
Come on, mom.Let's go.

790
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:22,638
你为什么不一起来看看我们班呢
Why don't you come check out a class?

791
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:23,939
我觉得你会喜欢的
I think you'll really like it.

792
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,008
我会考虑得
I will think about that.

793
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:28,643
我可不想打扰你们之间的事儿
I mean, I don't want to step on your guys' thing.

794
00:28:28,644 --> 00:28:31,814
我可不想把你的感觉给弄没了
You know, I don't want to take that away from you.

795
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:34,183
- 好吧  - 嘿  哇哦  怎么了
- Okay. - Hey, whoa.What's that?Whoa.

796
00:28:34,884 --> 00:28:35,784
很好  祝你开心
Fine.Have a good day.

797
00:28:38,922 --> 00:28:40,322
我赢不了的
I can't win.

798
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:41,556
你呢
How about you?

799
00:28:41,557 --> 00:28:43,558
你想上网看球赛吗
You want to watch a little NFL network?

800
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:44,693
哈
Huh?

801
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:46,794
我们能一兄弟相称吗  我们能一起撞胸吗
Can we bro out?Can you chest bump?

802
00:28:46,795 --> 00:28:48,930
你能撞胸吗  我们来看看吧
Can you chest bump?Let's see.

803
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:51,065
真是个好撞胸呢  过来
Oh, that's a great chest bump.Come here.

804
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:52,500
走去看一小会儿橄榄球
Let's go watch a little football.

805
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:53,768
就你跟我
You and me.

806
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:56,471
巧克力薄片煎饼  多加一份巧克力
Chocolate chip pancakes,extra chocolate chips.

807
00:28:56,472 --> 00:28:58,405
好了  我得走了
Okay, I got to run.

808
00:28:58,406 --> 00:28:59,907
但是 老爸  你不能走
But, dad, you can't go.

809
00:28:59,908 --> 00:29:01,743
- 今天可是周六  - 对  我知道 宝贝
- It's Saturday. - Yeah, I know, sweetie.

810
00:29:01,744 --> 00:29:03,978
我今天尽量早点下班
I'll try to keep it short today,okay?

811
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:06,147
我给你做了鸡蛋  你想吃点什么吗
I was gonna make you eggs.Do you want anything to eat?

812
00:29:06,148 --> 00:29:08,082
不用了  我在路边摊买点吃吧
Uh, no, I'll just eat on site.

813
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:09,483
- 谢了  - 好吧
- Thanks. - Okay.

814
00:29:12,121 --> 00:29:13,721
马上回来
Be right back.

815
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:21,562
- 乔  - 什么事
- Joel. - Yeah?

816
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:23,063
- 乔  - 什么事
- Joel. - Yeah?

817
00:29:23,064 --> 00:29:26,833
孩子们知道这事儿了
The kids are picking up on this.

818
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:27,968
知道什么了
On what?

819
00:29:27,969 --> 00:29:29,903
我们俩之间的紧张感  或者他们...
On the tension between us,or they--

820
00:29:29,904 --> 00:29:32,739
那他们肯定不是从我这儿得知的
Well, they're not getting it from me.

821
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,175
乔  昨天西德妮问我
Joel, Sydney asked me yesterday

822
00:29:35,176 --> 00:29:37,043
为什么我们要吵的那么厉害
why we're fighting so much.

823
00:29:41,182 --> 00:29:44,251
我想我们得做得更好了吧
Well,we'll just have to do a better job,I guess.

824
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:51,491
我们必须得讨论维克多的事儿
We have to talk to Victor and we have to,you know,

825
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:53,092
我们必须达成一致
get on the same page, here.

826
00:29:53,093 --> 00:29:54,927
- 我们不能一直这样下去  - 我知道  茱莉亚
- We can't be doing this.- I know, Julia.

827
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:59,299
不能再这样互相斗下去了
Undermining each other,you know?

828
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,934
我会一直支持我的儿子的
I will be there for my son.

829
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:14,947
从左侧突破了一个巨大的缺口
Powering through a big hole in the left side,

830
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:16,615
现在已经接近了二十五号
now near the 25.

831
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:17,883
我搞不懂了  老爸
I don't get it, dad.

832
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:19,185
这不是我们一小时之前看的
This is not the same game

833
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:20,519
那场比赛吗
we were watching an hour ago?

834
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,153
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

835
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,489
- 你想说什么  - 这个都放了一天了
- What's your point? - They play all day.

836
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,257
他们看起来就像同一组人
These look like the same guys.

837
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:27,659
- 嗯  - 同样的颜色
- Yeah.- Like, the same colors.

838
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:31,196
我真不敢相信你就是
I just can't believe that this is how

839
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:32,864
想这样过周六的
you want to spend your Saturday.

840
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:34,866
这是你这样过的周六
Well, this is how you're spending your Saturday.

841
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:36,034
我就不明白了
I mean, I don't understand that.

842
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:37,435
你应该出去见新朋友的
You should be out there meeting people.

843
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:39,938
玩啊之类的  你为什么不去
You know, having fun.Why aren't you doing that?

844
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:42,841
不好意思  我才不需要出去见新朋友呢
Excuse me,I don't need to be out there meeting people.

845
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:45,643
我在这儿陪我最爱的老爸
I'm here with my dear old dad.

846
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:49,214
如果你想知道的话
And if you must know,I was invited

847
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:52,650
我被人邀请去一个派对  但是我不去
to a party tonight,and I'm not going.

848
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:54,518
你为什么不去
Why aren't you going?

849
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,120
因为  要陪你呀
Because.Here with you.

850
00:30:57,121 --> 00:31:00,290
再加上我什么人都不认识
Plus, I won't...You know, I don't know anybody.

851
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,793
你要是一直坐在这儿陪一个老男人
Well,you're not gonna get a chance to know anybody

852
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,528
你永远都没机会认识任何人
sitting around here with your old man.

853
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,029
我不需要男人  老爸
I don't need a man, dad.

854
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,531
我一个人照样活得好好的
I am fine on my own, you know.

855
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,467
我又不是在说男人  萨拉
Well,I wasn't necessarily talking about a man,Sarah.

856
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,169
- 哦  - 你已经变了  而我...
- Oh. - You've changed, and I...

857
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,503
你开始了一段新的人生
You started this whole new life.

858
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,804
有了个新地方住着
You got a whole new place.

859
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:17,407
你可以继续出去冒险
You can go out there and have adventures,

860
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:20,177
你可以像向你母亲说的那样
and you can expand your horizons like your mother's

861
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:21,278
开阔你的视野
talking about doing.

862
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,113
尽管去做就是了
Just go do that, you know?

863
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,482
那谁来陪你呢
Who's gonna hang out here with you?

864
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,718
真奇怪诶  有你在这儿
Well,quite frankly,having you around here

865
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:31,554
抱怨我做的事  还...
complaining about what I'm doing, and...

866
00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:33,590
好吧  老爸  我要去开阔我的视野了 好吗
All right, dad,I'm gonna expand, okay?

867
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:36,826
我要去冒险了
I'm gonna expand my horizons to have an adventure

868
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:39,028
我马上就去参加派对
and I'm gonna go to this party

869
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:41,030
尽管我一个人都不认识  好吗
where I don't know anybody, okay?

870
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:43,266
你这样做一段时间
And while you're doing all of that,

871
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:44,666
你就会遇到个好男人
you might meet a nice guy.

872
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:46,402
我不想遇到一个什么男人  老爸
I don't want to met a guy, dad.

873
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:47,636
好吧  好吧
Okay. Fine.

874
00:31:47,637 --> 00:31:49,105
但为了预防此事发生  我要拿走你的啤酒
But in case I do,I'm taking your beer.

875
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:50,572
- 晚安   - 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

876
00:31:50,573 --> 00:31:53,842
两年前  小鲍跟我的侄女
Two years ago, Bob little had an inappropriate relationship

877
00:31:53,843 --> 00:31:57,346
当时还只是一个十九岁的实习生发生了不正当的关系
with my niece, who was then his 19-year-old assistant.

878
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:01,717
我不知道我是否该这样做
I don't know if I can do this.

879
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:03,485
当然  你可以的  克里斯蒂娜
Yes, you can, Kristina.

880
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:07,255
安博希望你这样做
Amber wants you to.

881
00:32:13,362 --> 00:32:17,032
大家下午好
Good afternoon.

882
00:32:19,201 --> 00:32:20,835
很感谢你们得到来
Thank you all for being here today.

883
00:32:20,836 --> 00:32:22,804
你们其中很多人在我发表
There's a lot more of you here

884
00:32:22,805 --> 00:32:24,672
参选演说的时候也来过
than when I announced my candidacy,

885
00:32:24,673 --> 00:32:27,842
所以很高兴再次见到你们
so it's good to see.

886
00:32:27,843 --> 00:32:30,345
我不认为一个竞选应该
I don't think this campaign

887
00:32:30,346 --> 00:32:32,713
掺杂个人攻击
should be about personal attacks,

888
00:32:32,714 --> 00:32:34,749
所以 在经过自我反省之后
which is why after much soul-searching,

889
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,553
我被迫得毫无顾忌的向媒体说出
I am compelled to speak out against what's been going on

890
00:32:38,554 --> 00:32:43,558
关于我的家人  我自己的一些真相
in the media, about my family,about myself.

891
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:55,035
三年前  当我丈夫在杂货店的时候
Three years ago,my husband was checking out

892
00:32:55,036 --> 00:32:58,705
一个非常无力的人
of a grocery store when a very rude man

893
00:32:58,706 --> 00:33:02,142
叫我儿子拖油瓶
called my son a retard.

894
00:33:02,143 --> 00:33:03,978
既然我们都觉得”拖油瓶“
And while I think we can all agree

895
00:33:03,979 --> 00:33:07,146
这个词非常丑陋不堪
that the word "retard"is very ugly,

896
00:33:07,147 --> 00:33:10,016
要是换做你们的儿子患了艾斯伯格综合症的话
I think it's really offensive when your son

897
00:33:10,017 --> 00:33:13,753
你们也会觉得被冒犯
has Asperger's syndrome.

898
00:33:13,754 --> 00:33:16,122
所以  我的丈夫  作为一个想保护
So my husband,being the protective father

899
00:33:16,123 --> 00:33:18,859
自己儿子的男人  他...
that he is...

900
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,127
就走了那个人
Well, he punched the man.

901
00:33:21,128 --> 00:33:24,397
事实上  我之所以竞选市长
Actually,one of the reasons why I'm running for mayor

902
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:26,299
的其中一个原因就是要反抗
and one of the things that I'm fighting against

903
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,701
此类歧视的事儿
is exactly this type of intolerance.

904
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:31,937
我丈夫当时不会容忍  我也不会
My husband won't stand for it,and neither will I.

905
00:33:31,938 --> 00:33:35,608
或许你们会说这只是我们的价值观
I guess you could say that those are our values.

906
00:33:37,511 --> 00:33:38,944
所以要是你们还有疑问的话
So if you have any questions,

907
00:33:38,945 --> 00:33:40,445
我也很乐意回答
I'd be happy to answer.

908
00:33:40,446 --> 00:33:43,048
你认为小鲍在此次竞选当中
What do you think about Bob little's tactics

909
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:44,049
使用了什么策略
in this campaign?

910
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,185
此时我不做评论
I have no comment.

911
00:33:53,588 --> 00:33:56,223
- 嘿  - 嗨
- Hey. - Hi.

912
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,357
都这么晚了
It's so late.

913
00:33:57,358 --> 00:33:59,393
我都给你打了好几次电话了
I tried to call you a couple times.

914
00:33:59,394 --> 00:34:01,161
抱歉  我不知道  抱歉
Sorry. I don't know.Sorry.

915
00:34:01,162 --> 00:34:02,829
没关系
It's okay.

916
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,065
下班太晚了
Got off late.

917
00:34:05,066 --> 00:34:07,134
我把戒指还回去了
I took the ring back.

918
00:34:07,135 --> 00:34:09,036
轻而易举
Pretty easy.

919
00:34:09,037 --> 00:34:11,271
- 是吗   - 对
- You did? - Yeah.

920
00:34:11,272 --> 00:34:13,073
还是管用的
So it's all gonna work out.

921
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:16,442
你感觉如何
Um, how do you feel?

922
00:34:16,443 --> 00:34:19,712
你觉得还好吗  能接受吗
Do you feel...Do you feel okay about it all?

923
00:34:19,713 --> 00:34:21,614
当然  感觉非常好
Yeah, yeah.I feel great.

924
00:34:21,615 --> 00:34:24,250
我们再去买个更合适的就行
Just gonna get the right one.

925
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:25,818
因为你知道并不是
'Cause you know-- you know it's not

926
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:27,053
因为我不够爱它
that I didn't love it very much.

927
00:34:27,054 --> 00:34:28,354
- 我很爱它   - 我知道
- I did. - No, I know.

928
00:34:28,355 --> 00:34:29,989
因为这样对我们更好一些  对吗
It's because it's better for us, right?

929
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,557
- 这样我们...  - 绝对的
- Like, we can--  - Absolutely. Yeah.

930
00:34:31,558 --> 00:34:32,724
- 真的吗  - 真的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

931
00:34:32,725 --> 00:34:33,926
我是真想这么做
I really want to do that.

932
00:34:33,927 --> 00:34:35,361
- 好吧  - 这样非常好
- Okay. - That's good.

933
00:34:35,362 --> 00:34:37,430
- 很好  - 对
- Good. - Yeah.

934
00:34:37,431 --> 00:34:39,898
你想让我过来陪你一会儿吗
Hey,you want a little company over there?

935
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:41,567
我马上就上床来
Ah, I'm gonna come to bed in just a sec.

936
00:34:41,568 --> 00:34:44,437
我就想先放松会儿
I'm just--I'm just relaxing.

937
00:34:44,438 --> 00:34:46,272
嗯
Mm.

938
00:34:59,318 --> 00:35:02,187
嘿  小鬼  我们能谈谈吗
Hey, kiddo.Can we talk?

939
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:04,055
当然
Sure.

940
00:35:04,056 --> 00:35:06,057
好吧
Okay.

941
00:35:08,094 --> 00:35:10,095
嗯...
Um...

942
00:35:13,532 --> 00:35:15,200
这周我跟你爸
This week, your dad and I

943
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:16,968
跟明基朵老师谈过了
have been talking to miss Mikindoe.

944
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:18,403
- 我惹什么麻烦了吗  - 没有
- Am I in trouble? - No.

945
00:35:18,404 --> 00:35:20,838
- 刚好相反  - 对  一点麻烦也没有
- No, just the opposite. - Yeah, not at all.

946
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:23,340
我们很为你骄傲
So proud of you, man.

947
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:25,576
大家都知道你学习很努力
Everybody knows you're working so hard.

948
00:35:25,577 --> 00:35:28,378
我的成绩还是很差
My grades still suck.

949
00:35:28,379 --> 00:35:33,217
我们想让你
Well, here's what we want for you.

950
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:34,986
换个地方学习
We want you to have a place

951
00:35:34,987 --> 00:35:36,920
好让你能跟上进度
where you can take some time to catch up

952
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:39,389
你也能有更多的时间提升你的阅读能力
and you can work on your reading skills.

953
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:42,993
而且我跟你爸觉得
And so your dad and I thought that it would be

954
00:35:42,994 --> 00:35:46,896
让你在下半年去四年级念书对你有好处
good for you to spend the rest of the year in fourth grade.

955
00:35:51,869 --> 00:35:54,971
我不想...我不想这么做
I don't want to--I don't want to do that.

956
00:35:54,972 --> 00:35:57,641
我能理解
I can understand that.

957
00:35:57,642 --> 00:35:59,743
我们会一直陪着你的
And we'll be here for you the whole time.

958
00:35:59,744 --> 00:36:01,244
不不  这不公平
No, no, this isn't fair.

959
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:02,946
我们这学年都过了快一半了
We're almost half way through the year.

960
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:06,382
儿子  我知道这很不公平
Buddy, I know it doesn't seem fair.

961
00:36:06,383 --> 00:36:08,317
我们可能会尽快这么做  维克多
We probably should have done it sooner,Victor,

962
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:10,286
但我们想知道这是不是正确的决定
but we want to make sure it was the right decision.

963
00:36:10,287 --> 00:36:12,321
但是我会跟西德妮在同一个年级
But then I'll be in the same grade as Sydney?

964
00:36:12,322 --> 00:36:14,257
那我的朋友怎么办
And what about all my friends?

965
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:15,891
我就在也见不着他们了
I'll never see them again.

966
00:36:15,892 --> 00:36:18,861
你还记得你才来的时候吗
You remember when you started little league?

967
00:36:18,862 --> 00:36:20,563
你还记得当时有多难
Do you remember how hard that was

968
00:36:20,564 --> 00:36:22,798
你一开始有多害怕吗
and how scary it was to you at first?

969
00:36:22,799 --> 00:36:24,500
你从没放弃
You'd never done it.

970
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:26,702
- 而且你那么努力  - 没错
- And you practiced so hard. - Exactly.

971
00:36:26,703 --> 00:36:28,037
你花了时间
You really put in the time.

972
00:36:28,038 --> 00:36:29,838
你也花了不少努力  后来不是变好了吗
You put in the work and then it clicked for it.

973
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,406
现在也会那样的
And that's what this is gonna be.

974
00:36:31,407 --> 00:36:33,608
你会回到四年级  你会
You're gonna go back to fourth and you're gonna,you know,

975
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:37,112
继续努力  然后事情一样会顺利的
try so hard and then it's just gonna click.

976
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:38,681
你知道吗  会好起来的
You know?It's just gonna click for you.

977
00:36:38,682 --> 00:36:41,150
- 从那儿开始...  - 维克多
- And from that point on...- Victor.

978
00:36:41,151 --> 00:36:42,750
你做得到的
You can do this.

979
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:46,020
你是个勇敢的男孩  你做得到的
You're a brave boy.I know you can do this

980
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:50,525
我么也会一直帮你的
and we'll help you.

981
00:36:50,526 --> 00:36:52,260
会好起来的  儿子
It's gonna be fine.Buddy.

982
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:59,200
我想一个人待会儿
I want to be left alone.

983
00:36:59,201 --> 00:37:02,236
出去
Get out.

984
00:37:02,237 --> 00:37:03,971
我说了  出去
I said to get out!

985
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:34,500
行了
Yeah.

986
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:37,904
哇哦
Wow.

987
00:37:37,905 --> 00:37:40,040
- 嗨  - 嗨  亲爱的
- Hi! - Hi, sweetie.

988
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:41,341
米莉
Millie!

989
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,309
我正要出去呢  你就打给我了
You just caught me on my way out.

990
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,778
我正准备去赶汽车呢
I was about to run for the bus.

991
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:46,312
好吧  天呐
Okay.Boy.

992
00:37:46,313 --> 00:37:48,948
嘿  米尔  卡米尔  你看起来真漂亮  亲爱的
Hey, mill--Camille,you look beautiful, honey.

993
00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:50,250
你玩的开心吗
Are you having a great time?

994
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:53,620
太棒了
Oh, it's just been amazing.

995
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:56,756
让我看看  从哪儿说起呢
Um, let me see.Where do I start?

996
00:37:56,757 --> 00:37:59,191
我们每天早上都在作画
We've been painting every morning.

997
00:37:59,192 --> 00:38:03,296
老师真是太优秀了
The teacher is just--he's just extraordinary.

998
00:38:03,297 --> 00:38:06,198
- 我受益颇多   - 这就好
- I'm learning so much. - Oh, good.

999
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,967
明天我们要去佛罗伦萨
And tomorrow we go to Florence.

1000
00:38:07,968 --> 00:38:10,369
我们要素描乌菲齐
We're going to sketch at the uffizi.

1001
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,105
- 什么  - 乌菲齐
- What? - The uffizi.

1002
00:38:13,106 --> 00:38:14,874
是一个博物馆
The--it's a museum.

1003
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,842
哦  很好  太棒了
Oh, great, great, great.

1004
00:38:16,843 --> 00:38:19,411
这就是说你玩的很开心咯
Well,I mean,so you're really enjoying yourself?

1005
00:38:19,412 --> 00:38:21,880
哦 哇哦
Oh, wow.

1006
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:23,482
还有食物
And the food.

1007
00:38:23,483 --> 00:38:25,850
亲爱的  我们简直爱死它了
Sweetie, you would jut love it.

1008
00:38:25,851 --> 00:38:28,019
意大利面真是太新鲜了
The pasta is so fresh!

1009
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,422
不管你在哪儿吃都是那么嚼劲十足
It's always Al dente.It doesn't matter where you eat.

1010
00:38:30,423 --> 00:38:32,524
即使是在一个很简陋的小餐馆都是一样
Could be a little hole-in-the-wall restaurant.

1011
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:34,459
我很开心你玩的那么高兴
Well, I'm glad you're having a good time.

1012
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,528
- 你呢  - 很好
- How are you? - Great.

1013
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:38,163
很好 很好  一切都还好
Great, great.Everything's fine here.

1014
00:38:38,164 --> 00:38:41,032
我浇着那些植物  孩子们也是不是过来看看
I'm watering the plants.The kids are stopping by.

1015
00:38:41,033 --> 00:38:42,566
他们烦死我了  但是
They're bothering me,but, you know,

1016
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:43,634
我想你了  米莉
I miss you, Millie.

1017
00:38:43,635 --> 00:38:45,003
我想你了
I miss you.

1018
00:38:45,004 --> 00:38:47,538
- Andiamo  - 我得走了
- Andiamo. - Oh, I gotta go.

1019
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:48,873
这是车要开了的意思
That means the bus is leaving.

1020
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:50,741
但是...好吧  别错过汽车了
But...okay, well,don't miss your bus.

1021
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:52,677
米莉  我爱你
Millie, I love you.

1022
00:38:52,678 --> 00:38:53,878
你...我爱你
Did you--I love you!

1023
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:55,379
但是...
But...

1024
00:38:58,049 --> 00:38:59,950
怎么...
What...

1025
00:39:01,986 --> 00:39:04,254
好吧
Okay.

1026
00:39:04,255 --> 00:39:06,123
亲爱的  这其实也算件好事儿
Honey, it's actually kind of good.

1027
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:08,058
大家都挺积极的回应着这件事
People are responding in a really positive way.

1028
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:09,360
- 是吗  - 是的
- Oh, yeah? - Yup.

1029
00:39:09,361 --> 00:39:11,494
“我们一直挺你  克里斯蒂娜  继续斗争下去
"We're with you, Kristina.Keep up the good fight.

1030
00:39:11,495 --> 00:39:12,796
站在你自己家人那边”
Way to stand up for your family."

1031
00:39:12,797 --> 00:39:13,897
看看
Look at that.

1032
00:39:13,898 --> 00:39:15,465
所以他们也会做同样的事儿
So they would have done the same thing.

1033
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:16,934
看吧  你不诽谤别人也同样
See,you don't need to participate in

1034
00:39:16,935 --> 00:39:18,335
能赢得竞赛
a smear campaign to win this thing.

1035
00:39:18,336 --> 00:39:19,803
这不是我们要做的 对吗
That's not what we're about,right?

1036
00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:20,904
这不是你要做的
It's not what you're about.

1037
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:22,672
你也一样
You either.

1038
00:39:22,673 --> 00:39:25,075
你做出的选择
Well, you made the choice.

1039
00:39:25,076 --> 00:39:27,277
无论发生了什么  我都为你而骄傲
And no matter what happens,I'm proud of you for that.

1040
00:39:27,278 --> 00:39:28,878
你坚持了自我
You stuck to your guns.

1041
00:39:28,879 --> 00:39:30,313
你没有使阴招
You didn't go for the jugular

1042
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:33,516
即使我跟海瑟都告诉你该这样做
even though Heather and I were both telling you to do that.

1043
00:39:33,517 --> 00:39:35,685
- 你做了正确的事儿  - 你们也是在帮我  谢了
- You did the right thing.- You guys trying to help.Thanks.

1044
00:39:35,686 --> 00:39:36,919
我才不只这样说呢
I'm not just saying all this

1045
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,388
因为你让我看起来跟个卑鄙小人一样
'cause you made me look like a badass.

1046
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:40,790
你确实是个卑鄙小人
You are a badass.

1047
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:42,659
- 我不是  克里斯蒂娜  - 你就是
- I'm not a badass, Kristina.- You're a badass.

1048
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,593
我不是  我只是个男人而已  好吗
I'm not.I'm just a man, okay?

1049
00:39:44,594 --> 00:39:48,130
有时候一个男人应该在某人
Sometimes a man needs to kick a little ass

1050
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:49,598
需要被踢的时候踢他一脚
when somebody's ass needs kicking.

1051
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,901
- 没错  - 好吧
- That's correct. - Okay.

1052
00:39:51,902 --> 00:39:55,204
- 你是个好父亲   -谢谢  我爱你
- And you are a good dad.- Thank you. I love you.

1053
00:39:55,205 --> 00:39:57,273
- 也是最好的丈夫   - 我爱你
- And the best husband. - I love you.

1054
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:00,109
天呐  她吓到我了
Gosh.She scares me.

1055
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:03,645
她有好事儿的时候从不发短信的
She never texts when it's good--

1056
00:40:03,646 --> 00:40:06,782
你为什么不告诉她你需要十五分钟呢
why don't you just tell her you need 15 minutes.

1057
00:40:06,783 --> 00:40:08,684
怎么啦
What is it?

1058
00:40:08,685 --> 00:40:11,286
降了四个百分点
Dropped four points.

1059
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:13,822
嗯...
Um...

1060
00:40:13,823 --> 00:40:14,990
好吧
Okay.

1061
00:40:14,991 --> 00:40:16,291
- 被拉至六个百分点了  - 没关系的
- Training by six.- That's okay.

1062
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:17,893
你告诉过我这些事儿
You told me that these things

1063
00:40:17,894 --> 00:40:19,761
会有错误的余地的  对吗
have a margin of error, right?

1064
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:21,696
那么两分  你可以被落后
By a couple points,so you could have just dropped

1065
00:40:21,697 --> 00:40:23,965
一两分的  只是有一点波动而已
a point or two,and that could just be a little fluctuation.

1066
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:26,868
根本不关记者招待会什么事
Doesn't have to necessarily do with the press conference.

1067
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:29,504
对
Right.

1068
00:40:29,505 --> 00:40:33,208
克里斯蒂娜  你会赢的
Kristina,you can win this thing.

1069
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:36,343
对
