00:00:04,826 --> 00:00:05,927
这是什么地方
What is this place?

2
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:08,762
- 我到底怎么了 嘿 嘿 这里...
- What's wrong with me?! - Hey, hey, hey, here...

3
00:00:08,796 --> 00:00:12,132
只是有点恶心 瞧
It's just a little bit of transcendental sickness. Look...

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,900
好吧
Okay...

5
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:23,910
抱歉
Sorry...

6
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:26,817
那到底是什么东西 
What the hell was that? 

7
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,247
我刚刚救了你的命
I just saved your life!

8
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:30,951
像你自己这样非元素的人从这架
Non-Elemental boys like yourself can't pass

9
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:33,453
飞机到另外一架是肯定会恶心的
from one plane to the next without getting sick.

10
00:00:33,487 --> 00:00:36,289
下一站和上一站是一样的
Next stop same as the last!

11
00:00:36,323 --> 00:00:38,524
上一站和这站也是一样的
Last stop same before next!

12
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,926
请准备好您的票
Get your tickets ready please!

13
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:43,729
嘿
Hey!

14
00:00:45,832 --> 00:00:46,665
嘿
Hey!

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,602
我们在找一个女人 她叫波...
We're looking for a woman. Her name is Bo...

16
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:52,171
哇呜！
Whoa!

17
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:56,242
对这些家伙不用担心
Nothing to worry about folks!

18
00:00:56,276 --> 00:01:00,613
工程师肯定忘了他的眼镜
The engineer must have forgotten his glasses!

19
00:01:05,284 --> 00:01:06,118
嘿
Hey!

20
00:01:09,956 --> 00:01:12,424
当提到波的名字时 是我震了下
Is it me or did this entire train just shake

21
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:13,891
还是整节火车震了下
at the mention of Bo's name?

22
00:01:23,636 --> 00:01:24,802
这诅咒灵魂的尖叫
The screams...

23
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:28,240
被捕捉到了 他们也正试着逃出来
damned souls are trapped and they're trying to get out.

24
00:01:28,974 --> 00:01:31,609
我们从这逃出来 找到了你的女孩
We gotta get out of here and find your girl.

25
00:01:31,644 --> 00:01:32,543
来吧
Come on.

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,454
- 您能停下来吗 - 我讨厌这个地方
- Would you please stop with the attitude? - I hate this place.

27
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:20,723
这里啥都没有 无线网也没有 这就是一屎坑
There's no WIFI or anything, and it's a shit-hole!

28
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,525
我来这只呆一夜
It's just gonna be for one night.

29
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:31,133
呆在这
Stay here...

30
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,914
家
Home?

31
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:55,857
什么 有人已经做过了什么
What? Someone had to do something.

32
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,431
当你不知你是谁时 生活会很艰辛
Life is hard when you don't know who you are.

33
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,200
当你知道真相后 生活会更艰难
It's harder when you don't know what you are.

34
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,103
我的爱伴随死神的降临
My love carries a death sentence.

35
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,239
我迷失了多年
I was lost for years...

36
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:13,108
在藏匿中找寻
Searching, while hiding.

37
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,278
那个不为人知的属于我的世界
Only to find that I belong to a world hidden from humans.

38
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,748
但我已厌倦躲藏 
I won't hide anymore.

39
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,416
我要过自己想要的生活
I will live the life I choose.

40
00:03:33,795 --> 00:03:36,530
左边松 右边紧
Lefty loosey. Righty tighty.

41
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:39,900
看到你妈妈穿着睡衣在
Seen your mother in her nighty.

42
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,671
问题出在这啊
Oh, there's the little trouble maker.

43
00:03:52,881 --> 00:03:54,915
需要帮助嘛 姑娘
Can I help you, young lady?

44
00:03:56,751 --> 00:04:00,553
你把一架钢琴丢在了波兰 不是吗
You miss the piano that you left back in Poland, don't you?

45
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:05,091
真遗憾 我本可以让你出名的
Pity. I could have made you a star.

46
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,877
我勒个去
Holy crap!

47
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:28,247
- 你做了什么 - 稍微整理了下
- What did you do? - A little reorganizing.

48
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:31,250
- 可以吗 - 可以?
- Is it okay? - Okay?

49
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:33,786
这里比我那狗窝整齐多了
This place is more organized than my shitty apartment.

50
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:37,556
嗯... 糖摆在盐和胡椒旁
Um... sugar is with salt and pepper.

51
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,490
显然
Obviously.

52
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:42,294
好吧 那醋同蕃茄酱和其他调味品在一起
And, um, vinegar is with ketchup and other condiments.

53
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:45,764
噢 不再跟小苏打放了
Oh! And no longer directly next to the baking soda

54
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:48,599
你绝对能想到当我看到
... you can imagine my surprise when I saw that ...

55
00:04:48,634 --> 00:04:50,768
这两种东西绝对混合在一起开了个聚会
actually everybody's surprised if those two decide

56
00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:52,804
我和我的小伙伴都惊呆了
to mix it up and have a party.

57
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:56,107
碳酸实际上是不稳定的
Carbonic acid is actually very unstable ...

58
00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:00,078
有一点像这里...和罗纳德
kind of like this place ... and Ronald.

59
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:03,248
- 你真滑稽   - 我吗
- You're hilarious. - Am I?

60
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,653
所以呢 你喜欢吗 
So? You like? 

61
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:08,687
是的 我太喜欢了
Yeah. I do like.

62
00:05:18,764 --> 00:05:20,865
我要点糖
I just need some sugar.

63
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,437
克里斯朵... 我做不到
Crystal... I can't.

64
00:05:32,443 --> 00:05:33,677
休息结束了
Break's over!

65
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:35,445
- 休息结束了！！！  - 看到没
- Break's over!!! - See?

66
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:37,781
太不稳定了
Unstable.

67
00:05:37,948 --> 00:05:40,450
看到了 太好玩了
See. Funny.

68
00:06:02,907 --> 00:06:05,375
- 你刚在火车上吗 - 什么火车
- Were you on the train? - What train?

69
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:07,877
妈妈 火车很明显是海洛因的另称
Mom... "train" is obviously slang for heroin.

70
00:06:07,912 --> 00:06:10,752
我的意思是 瞧瞧她 
I mean, just look at her. 

71
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:12,882
你好 我叫凯西
Hi, my name is Kathy.

72
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:16,685
这是我的...充满活力的女儿 朱莉安
and this is my... energetic daughter, Julia.

73
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,895
为什么他要那样走路
Why is he walking like that?

74
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:29,531
那是老金宁思家族的迷信
Oh, it's an old Jenkins family superstition.

75
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:32,734
- 周末玩的愉快 -  那些烟雾到哪去了
- Makes for a fun weekend. - Where did all the smoke go?

76
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,236
有人把所有的玻璃都打碎了
Somebody broke all those glasses.

77
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,172
- 婊子你脑子是不是坏掉了 - 朱莉安!
- Bitch, I think your brain broke ... - Julia!

78
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:39,374
这些对劳伦有用吗
Does this have something to do with Lauren?

79
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:41,776
上帝啊 为什么我记不住呢 我...
Oh, God... why can't I remember, I...

80
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,882
- 有人打我了吗  - 妈妈打的
- Did somebody hit me? - Mom did.

81
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,617
上帝啊
Oh, God...

82
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,587
上帝啊 我太饿了
Oh, God, I am so hungry.

83
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,922
你想吃点什么吗
Would you like something to eat?

84
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,824
求你不要问我吃什么
Oh, please do not ask me that.

85
00:06:56,224 --> 00:06:58,326
把他们都杀了吧 杀了他们...
Kill them... Kill them all...

86
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,527
干掉他们
Kill them.

87
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,129
振作起来啊 丹妮丝
Oh... Keep it together, Dennis.

88
00:07:02,497 --> 00:07:04,498
好吧 鞋子都挂在...
Okay... shoes are all hung...

89
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:06,567
伊恩... 我们的客人醒了
Ian... our guest is awake.

90
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:17,878
你不要把我爸当热狗一样看好吗
Uh, can you not look at my Dad like he's made out of hotdogs?

91
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:20,647
- 小姑娘 - 没事
- Young lady ... - It's okay.

92
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:25,563
她让我想起我最好的朋友 真舒服
She reminds me of my best friend. It's comforting.

93
00:07:26,253 --> 00:07:27,451
听着 我不想对你粗鲁
Look, I don't mean to be rude, 

94
00:07:27,452 --> 00:07:28,889
但是你真的要走了...
but you need to go...

95
00:07:28,923 --> 00:07:32,225
爸爸 她快死了啊 天啊
Dad. She's practically a dead person. Jesus.

96
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:34,194
她要走了 就现在
She needs to go. Now.

97
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:35,395
伊恩 她什么都没有
Ian, she hasn't had anything...

98
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:35,929
女孩们
Girls!!!

99
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:41,868
就现在
Now!

100
00:07:47,608 --> 00:07:49,442
我能先用下卫生间吗
Can I use the ladies room first?

101
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:57,116
这是她的房间 她在这
This was her room. She was here.

102
00:08:03,223 --> 00:08:05,057
嘿 起床了啊！
Hey! Wake up!

103
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:08,394
那个对你做过的女孩... 
The girl that did this to you... 

104
00:08:08,395 --> 00:08:10,396
她真擅长接吻啊...
She's such a good kisser...

105
00:08:11,564 --> 00:08:14,066
她在哪！ 波在哪
Where is she?! Where's Bo?!

106
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:23,074
他要是发现她走了 他肯定会疯掉的
He's gonna be so angry when he finds out she's gone...

107
00:08:26,412 --> 00:08:27,178
波!!!
Bo!!!

108
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:40,224
这是她的
This was hers.

109
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:43,727
她从这跳下去的痛相比你刚刚的难受
If she jumped from the sickness that you had

110
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:46,230
那只是冰山一角啊
a minute ago, it's just the tip of the iceberg.

111
00:08:46,265 --> 00:08:49,100
发热和胃痉挛都会导致死亡
The delirium and the stomach cramps are gonna lead to death.

112
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:50,442
但是我很好啊 
But I'm fine! 

113
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:52,236
因为你和我在一起 元素
Because you're with me, an Elemental.

114
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:53,871
但是这火车太特别了
And this train is special.

115
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:56,506
如果你没有邀请就离开或者进来的话...
If you leave or enter without an invitation ...

116
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,758
或者只是靠一下 
or at least an anchor... 

117
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,342
但是你可以救她 不是吗
But you could save her, right?

118
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:00,844
我不知道 也许吧...
I don't know. Maybe...

119
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,512
你可以的 加油...
You can do this, come on...

120
00:09:15,226 --> 00:09:17,394
系好你的安全带 男孩
Fasten your seat belt, Lover Boy.

121
00:10:16,953 --> 00:10:19,220
你到底在这搞什么
What the hell are you doing down here?

122
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:23,760
今年还没过很久呢 是吗 伊恩?
Not so much father of the year, are we, Ian?

123
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:29,766
你认为你可以让别人来违背他们的意愿
You think you can just hold people against their will? Huh?

124
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:32,102
你要让你的女儿把牢底坐穿
You're keeping your daughter prisoner?

125
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:33,629
你太不了解我了 
You don't know anything about me... 

126
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,272
我们正在保护朱莉安
We are protecting Julia.

127
00:10:35,307 --> 00:10:37,774
我不需要你的保护
I don't need you to protect me.

128
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:40,578
- 保护她干什么 - 一个傻逼幽灵
- Protect her from what? - A stupid ghost!

129
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:42,813
再来一次
Come again?

130
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:47,584
我家被鬼缠身了
My family's haunted.

131
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:51,373
我们都是为每年的今天而来
Every year on this exact day it comes for us.

132
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:53,056
这就是我为什么要逃出这
That's why we come out here.

133
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:55,859
我们离开我们的邻居 我们离开我们的家族
We get away from neighbors, we get away from families.

134
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,595
我们把我们锁在这里一直到早晨
We lock ourselves in these cells until morning.

135
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:00,397
直到消失 
Until it's gone. 

136
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:02,665
为什么幽灵会缠住你的家族
Why is a ghost haunting your family?

137
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,135
我不知道 我身上貌似有他们的东西
I don't know. I just inherited the damn thing.

138
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:10,873
我家里每个人还没有告诉是什么时就死了
Everyone in my family died before they could tell my why.

139
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:14,443
你知道要想搞定这奇怪的东西是我要做的事情
Well, you know dealing with "weird shit" is kinda what I do.

140
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:16,946
我能帮助你
I can help.

141
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,495
天啊 帮助啥 哪有什么鬼 你这二货 
O-M-G, help what? There is no frigging ghost, you psychos!

142
00:11:24,054 --> 00:11:26,521
每年都会把我锁在这狗屁房间
Every year you lock me up in this stupid house,

143
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:28,791
我从来没有看见过一次鬼
and I have never even once seen a Ghost!

144
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:30,226
你休想再把我锁住了
You can't keep jailing me away!

145
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:33,194
- 好吧 就现在  - 爸爸 不要
- All right, it's time. - Dad! No!

146
00:11:33,963 --> 00:11:36,265
现在是你离开我房间的时候了
And it's time for you to leave my house.

147
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:39,000
如果我被锁住 她也要被锁住
If I'm locked up ... then she's locked up too.

148
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:42,837
你们两个不能呆在一起 朱莉安 你懂的
You both can't be in the same cell, Julia. You know that!

149
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:45,274
伊恩 要是她去外面 过了鞋子结呢?
Ian, what if she goes outside past the shoes and the knots?

150
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:48,176
我不会拿我女儿命来冒险
I am not risking my daughter's life!

151
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:51,212
现在你赶紧离开这
And you need to leave now!

152
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:55,454
- 爸爸 - 好 我就走
- Dad! - It's ok. I'll go.

153
00:12:01,257 --> 00:12:02,757
谢谢你做的一切
Thank you for everything.

154
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:13,268
在...
In...

155
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,651
好吧
Okay...

156
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:34,587
没有电话 没有信件 没有任何的回应
No phone calls, no letters. No correspondence of any kind.

157
00:12:34,622 --> 00:12:36,256
五年之类都没有
For five long years.

158
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,225
从现在开始 没有我 你活不下去
And now all of a sudden, you can't live without me.

159
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,528
我能说什么呢 我太感动了
What can I say? I'm touched.

160
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:43,697
如果生活教会我一件事情
If there's one thing that life has taught me,

161
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:46,132
那就是没有你 我绝对能活下去
it's that I can definitely live without you.

162
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,201
但是 我同意 你确实被感动了
But, I agree. You are touched.

163
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:51,404
现在开始 就有些不同了
Now, there is something different about you.

164
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,639
伊娃 你染过头发 
Evony. Did you dye your hair?

165
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:56,742
是的 谢谢你注意到
Yes. Thank you for noticing.

166
00:12:57,244 --> 00:13:00,213
这个颜色叫做把我眼球装回去
The color is called Grow-My-Eyeball-Back-

167
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:03,182
不然我把你变个球
Or-You-Will-Be-Growing-Back -A-Ball-Of-Your-Own!

168
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,517
- 朗朗上口啊 - 难道不是吗
- That's catchy. - Isn't it just?

169
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,518
是的
Yeah.

170
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,988
你在你的教堂合唱团里唱女高音 不是吗
You sing soprano in your church choir don't you?

171
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:11,890
是女低音
Alto.

172
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,594
我的孩子
Oh. My child...

173
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,534
我看见你还是可以和你的孩子相处的
I see you still have a way with children.

174
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,237
这职业真危险
Hazard of the profession, I suppose.

175
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,073
你要有我手上的权利
When you've been in power as long as I have ...

176
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,574
谁对你而言都是孩子
everyone is your child.

177
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,244
信不信由你
Like it or not,

178
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,213
某天你一觉醒来 你就成了妈
one day you just wake up and you're a mother.

179
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,450
还有德鲁
And Druid.

180
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,554
别让我失望
Don't disappoint me like 'Chanel Number Goo' did.

181
00:13:44,956 --> 00:13:48,192
- 我的眼睛是棕色的 - 它们有些棕色
- My eyes are brown. - Actually, they're imperial brown

182
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:51,396
瞳孔又有点发绿色
with a slight flare of green in the rim of the cornea.

183
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,732
别弄砸了
Just don't screw this up.

184
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,544
老爸? 老爸 我错了
Dad? Dad, I'm sorry...

185
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:09,413
- 嘿 - 你回来了
- Hey... - You came back.

186
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:11,882
想要个室友吗
Need a cell mate?

187
00:14:15,686 --> 00:14:17,186
你还好吗
Are you okay?

188
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:21,224
你就像健康课视频里的女孩
You kind of look like that girl from that video

189
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:23,319
刚刚生完恶心的孩子 
in health class giving gross birth. 

190
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,694
没事的 肯吉
It's fine, Kenz, really.

191
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:27,196
谁是肯吉?
Uh, who's Kenz?

192
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:31,701
肯定是我思念已久的人
Somebody I obviously miss very much.

193
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:37,173
听着 朱莉安 怎么回事?
Look, um, Julia... What is going on?

194
00:14:37,774 --> 00:14:40,243
我也有过不好的家庭团聚
I've been to my share of bad family reunions,

195
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:43,562
相信我 这是个疯狂的小镇
believe me, but this is crazy town.

196
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,514
我能给你看个东西吗
Um, can I show you something?

197
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:48,017
杀了他们 把他们杀光
Kill them... Kill them all

198
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:49,384
杀了他们
Kill them...

199
00:14:52,722 --> 00:14:55,958
我们家的人 一直都会死
People in my family, keep... they keep dying.

200
00:14:56,993 --> 00:14:59,394
凶杀 自杀
Murder. Suicide.

201
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:05,733
我的祖父毒死了全家 几乎全家死亡
My great grandfather he poisoned his whole family, almost, and then...

202
00:15:05,768 --> 00:15:08,170
还把他们放在桌旁 开茶会
posed them like dolls that are at a tea party.

203
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:10,505
还有这里
Um, and then there's...

204
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:13,494
这个
there's this.

205
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:16,840
这个小男孩 是我爸爸
That little boy, right there? That's my Dad.

206
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,181
他看见爸爸射杀全家
He saw his father shoot his entire family.

207
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:23,217
你知道他怎么谈论遗传鬼魂吗?
You know how he talked about inheriting this ghost?

208
00:15:23,251 --> 00:15:27,288
要是他有家族遗传病呢?
What if what he actually inherited is this thing? This...

209
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:30,191
这迫使他做这些疯狂的举动
...thing that keeps making them do all this horrible stuff.

210
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,727
你还见过更奇怪的吗
You've never seen anything out of the ordinary?

211
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:35,930
他把我锁在盒子里 好吗 他有病
He locks me in a box, okay? He's sick.

212
00:15:39,101 --> 00:15:41,602
我真害怕有一天他会伤害我们
I'm just scared that one day he's gonna hurt us.

213
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:51,379
那我无能为力了
Well, I guess there's nothing I can do.

214
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:55,883
不过可以救你出去
Except get you out of here.

215
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:02,022
谢谢 谢谢你听我说
Oh, thank you. Thank you for listening to me.

216
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:05,191
其实你还挺酷的 对一个
You know, for a totally loco chick breaking in our house, you're...

217
00:16:05,226 --> 00:16:06,560
破门而入的流浪女来说
you're actually pretty cool.

218
00:16:07,729 --> 00:16:08,395
来吧
Come on.

219
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:21,774
我们跟丢了她味道
We've lost her scent.

220
00:16:21,808 --> 00:16:24,944
不不 放心 我认识这片森林
No, no, relax... I know these woods.

221
00:16:24,978 --> 00:16:28,920
我朋友懒约翰被埋在这
My friend Lazy John was buried out here.

222
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:32,184
我靠着树睡着了 然后
He fell asleep against a tree and then...

223
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:36,188
- 猴子们把他埋了 - 猴子吗?
- monkeys buried him. - Monkeys?

224
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:43,799
约翰 约翰
John! John.

225
00:16:46,628 --> 00:16:48,228
约翰
John...

226
00:16:48,263 --> 00:16:50,764
嗨 约翰
Hi, John.

227
00:16:51,665 --> 00:16:54,533
- 你好啊 亲爱的 - 嗨 西里欧
- Hello. Hi, honey. - Hi, Clio.

228
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:56,803
约翰
John...


229
00:16:56,837 --> 00:17:00,006
见见我的生意伙伴
I would like you to meet my business associate.

230
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,143
- 约翰 - 生意伙伴
- John. - Business Associate.

231
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:07,146
你看到淫妖穿过树林吗
Have you seen a Succubus running through these woods?

232
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,850
你的淫妖昨晚过去的 不过...
Your Succubus ran through last night. But...

233
00:17:12,352 --> 00:17:15,621
她朝哪个方向走的
what direction did she go? Hm.

234
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:17,290
好吧
Okay.

235
00:17:21,027 --> 00:17:22,295
不许作评价
Don't judge me.

236
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:29,868
- 你可以添一只趾头 - 不
- You can lick one toe. - No!

237
00:17:31,037 --> 00:17:33,205
- 要他的 - 什么?
- Him. - Come again?

238
00:17:33,372 --> 00:17:35,640
你想不想找到淫妖了
Do you want to find your Succubus, or not?

239
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,876
生意伙伴
Business associate.

240
00:17:40,713 --> 00:17:43,715
天啊 你也太爱这姑娘了吧
Man! You must really love this girl.

241
00:17:43,749 --> 00:17:45,684
这话题不许再提了
We shall never speak of this again.

242
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:53,625
这些巫毒术到底是什么故事?
So, what's the real story with this voodoo juju?

243
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:55,293
显然是笨鬼进不来
Apparently the stupid ghost can't come inside

244
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:58,662
除非她解开所有的鞋子和扣 弱爆了
'til she tries on all the shoes and unties all the knots; lame!

245
00:17:58,697 --> 00:18:01,299
- 那向后倒呢? - 你向后走
- And walking backwards? - Oh, a ghost can't jump inside your body

246
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,666
鬼就不能附身 还真有道理
if you're walking backwards, duh. 'Cause that makes sense.

247
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,994
那可不是鬼魂
Oh. That's not a ghost.

248
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:08,717
那是附身鬼啊 朱莉安!
That's a body jumper! Julia!

249
00:18:08,718 --> 00:18:10,095
朱莉安 不
Julia, no!

250
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:23,444
天啊 你生病了?
Jesus! You're sick?

251
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:25,202
我让你别掺和
I told you not to interfere!

252
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:27,704
我很抱歉 我只想帮忙
Look, I'm sorry. I was just trying to help.

253
00:18:27,738 --> 00:18:29,605
帮忙 我已经控制住了
Help?! I had this under control!

254
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,473
伊恩!
Ian!

255
00:18:36,547 --> 00:18:39,114
- 朱莉安在哪倒下的? - 外面
- Where did Julia collapse? - Outside.

256
00:18:40,183 --> 00:18:42,017
鞋子结以外
Past the shoes and knots.

257
00:18:52,863 --> 00:18:54,096
伊恩 你在干嘛
Ian, what are you doing?!

258
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,847
我们曾说过要是我们中有人被附身 
We said if this thing entered one of us, 

259
00:18:56,848 --> 00:18:57,867
不论谁杀无赦
we would kill whoever that was!

260
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:00,124
不要杀朱莉安! 
But not Julia! 

261
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,571
我不会让她活...
I will not let her live...

262
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:04,172
让她忍受我忍过的一切
with what I had to live with.

263
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:07,037
伊恩! 求你了 她是我们的孩子
Ian! Please! She's our baby!

264
00:19:07,072 --> 00:19:09,745
我知道你童年发生过的事
I know what happened to you when you were young ...

265
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:11,179
可这事另有它法
but there is always another way.

266
00:19:11,213 --> 00:19:13,147
你一无所知
You don't know anything!

267
00:19:13,816 --> 00:19:17,986
你不知道它对我家人伤害多大
You don't know what this thing did to my family.

268
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:23,157
杀了我弟弟 妹妹 妈妈 爸爸
To my brother, to my sister my mother, my father!

269
00:19:25,227 --> 00:19:29,998
- 它指使我做 - 你?
- What it made me do. - You?

270
00:19:30,699 --> 00:19:33,033
你跟我说是你爸做的
You told me that was your father!

271
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,171
要是朱莉安也得做我经历过的事...
If Julia ever had to do what I did...

272
00:19:41,743 --> 00:19:45,646
你不懂它在你体内的感觉
You don't know what it's like to have something inside of you!

273
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,215
让你无法控制
To have something you just can't control.

274
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:52,719
其实 我懂 我能挽救这一切
Actually, yeah, I do. I can fix this.

275
00:19:52,753 --> 00:19:53,921
挽救?
Fix it?

276
00:19:55,689 --> 00:19:58,025
我手刃全家人之后
I can still hear that thing laughing...

277
00:20:01,262 --> 00:20:03,997
还能听到那玩意的笑声
...while I butchered everybody that I loved.

278
00:20:08,702 --> 00:20:10,537
你不能挽救邪恶
You can't fix pure evil.

279
00:20:19,112 --> 00:20:22,181
他说得对 我就是邪恶
He's right. I am pure evil.

280
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:24,683
我感觉太好了
And I ain't never felt better.

281
00:20:29,622 --> 00:20:31,623
走 躲起来 我不会让悲剧发生的
Go! Hide! I won't let anything happen!

282
00:20:31,658 --> 00:20:33,659
- 女儿不走我不走 - 我来处理
- Not without our daughter! - I've got this.

283
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:35,794
快点 走了
Come on, let's go!

284
00:20:51,243 --> 00:20:52,177
小费
Tips.

285
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,413
- 谢谢 - 嗯
- Thanks. - Mm-hmm.

286
00:21:00,752 --> 00:21:04,191
- 我脑子里太乱了 - 没事的 我了解
- I just have a lot on my mind. - It's okay. Really, I get it.

287
00:21:09,595 --> 00:21:10,928
你为什么在这
Why are you here?

288
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:15,032
- 我在这工作? - 我知道
- Uh... I work here? - Yeah, I know.

289
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:16,868
可是
It's just that...

290
00:21:18,937 --> 00:21:20,771
我知道为什么罗纳德在这
I know why Ronald is here.

291
00:21:21,272 --> 00:21:24,742
只是我还在回忆为什么我在这
And I'm still kinda working on why I'm here...

292
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,078
原来是这么个意思
Oh, that 'why are you here'.

293
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:30,714
要是太私人不方便的话...
You know what, if it's too personal a question...

294
00:21:31,616 --> 00:21:32,782
没事的
It's okay.

295
00:21:34,285 --> 00:21:39,023
我想
Uh... well, I guess...

296
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:42,059
有时 女孩家太不走运
...sometimes when a girl's had so much bad luck...

297
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:46,062
就觉得自己是一切霉运的起因
she can... start to feel like she's the one causing it.

298
00:21:46,898 --> 00:21:48,765
她就是扫把星
She is bad luck.

299
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:54,203
那时你也就坦然接受一切了
And that's when you start to except things.

300
00:21:54,238 --> 00:21:56,205
就像是镇里最好的歌手
Like how being the best singer in town

301
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,709
在大城市里一文不值
doesn't really mean very much in the big city.

302
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:04,680
你若不转换成小的梦想奋斗
And how sometimes big dreams will swallow you whole.

303
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:10,420
有时大抱负会将你整个吞噬掉
If you don't turn 'em into small ones instead.

304
00:22:12,256 --> 00:22:13,956
像这种小梦想
Small ones like this.

305
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:22,097
- 出售农场 - 小农场出售
- Farm for sale? - Small farm for sale.

306
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:24,667
不到十英亩
Just under ten acres.

307

一群鸡和猪
Couple of chickens. Pigs.

308

辛苦劳作一天 夜晚静坐下来看星星
Work hard all day and just sit and watch the stars at night.

310
00:22:34,577 --> 00:22:35,944
宛若天堂
Little heaven right there.

311
00:22:37,713 --> 00:22:40,449
- 明天见 - 嗯
- See you tomorrow. - Mm-hmm.

312
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:48,190
我知道你不想谈恋爱
Listen, I know you're not on the market

313
00:22:48,224 --> 00:22:51,859
可要想找人喝点酒
but if you ever wanna grab some beer and...

314
00:22:51,894 --> 00:22:53,727
吃点披萨 吐露心声
a pizza and vent...

315
00:22:54,996 --> 00:22:59,461
- 你知道我在哪 - 我根本不知道你住哪
- you know where I live. - I have no idea where you live.

316
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:17,183
你究竟是什么东西
What the hell are you?

317
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:18,885
两条腿的奇人
Awesome on two legs.

318
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,887
你是什么异种
And what type of Fae might you be?

319
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:22,555
受死 受死 受死吧
Jumbee,  Jumbee, Jumbee, Jumbee....

320
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:26,426
我不想伤害你朱莉安 可这婊子宁死不屈啊
Oh, I don't want to hurt you Julia, but this bitch ain't making it easy.

321
00:23:30,264 --> 00:23:32,565
啊 你他妈是谁
Ahhhh! Who the hell are you?

322
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,533
戴森
Dyson!

323
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:36,769
他叫戴森 没事的
His name is Dyson. It's okay.

324
00:23:41,175 --> 00:23:43,375
天啊 你怎么找到我的

325
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,544
我找人帮忙了
I had a little help.

326
00:23:47,881 --> 00:23:50,382
受死 受死 受死吧

346
00:25:12,507 --> 00:25:14,509
你不懂 当你从那火车
You don't understand. When you jumped from

347
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,310
跳下来的时候 你就病了 你需要帮助

What?

370
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:18,337
酒后胡言罢了 我想我没什么吐槽的了
It's probably the beer talking. I guess I ran out of bad shit to forget.

371
00:26:23,676 --> 00:26:27,879
想想我们真的能忘掉这一切
Imagine we could really forget all of that stuff ...

372
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,617
我们还剩什么
what would we have left?

373
00:27:20,331 --> 00:27:21,665
天啊
Oh, my God...

374
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:28,738
我有酒有披萨就够了 好吗
You know, I would have been fine with just beer and pizza, right?

375
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:32,275
倒轮你来说教
Now she tells me.

- 你 - 你不该那么做的
- you? - You shouldn't have done that.

不关你的事 你真不该瞎掺和
You shouldn't be meddling in things that don't concern you!

我一直都掺和与我无关的事
I always meddle in things that don't concern me.

387
00:28:38,373 --> 00:28:40,607

And if you don't stop torturing these innocent people

388

他们以为我是女巫
They thought I was a witch.

391
00:28:53,955 --> 00:28:57,724

And they wanted my fianc? my Noah, to see me proved a witch.

397
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:23,917

401
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:53,302
不
No!

402
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:16,232
他们让我们永远分开
They left us separate forever.

403
00:30:30,982 --> 00:30:33,649
除非金宁思家死绝 
And I ain't never gonna stop until every last one

404
00:30:33,684 --> 00:30:36,453
我绝不罢手

405
00:30:44,495 --> 00:30:48,798
他们杀了她 你的祖先杀了她
They killed her. Your ancestors killed her.

406
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,635
她和她的未婚夫 金宁思的 杀了她
Her and her fianc? also a Jenkins, murdered her!

407
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:54,470
天啊 怨恨深重啊
Oh, God! So much anger!

408
00:30:54,505 --> 00:30:56,972
苦难难敌 她永不会收手的
So much pain! She's never gonna stop!

409
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:00,976
为什么要让我们来还债
Why are they making me pay for what they did??

410
00:31:01,911 --> 00:31:04,946
- 因为因果报复循环 - 她要掌控一切了
- Because the past always comes calling. - She's trying to take over!

411
00:31:05,048 --> 00:31:06,548
跟她打 波
Fight her, Bo!

412
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:19,394
不错嘛 人类
Not bad. For a human.

413
00:31:19,695 --> 00:31:22,964
我永远任你派遣
Well, I am always at your disposal.

414
00:31:25,034 --> 00:31:28,469
派遣? 我喜欢
Disposal? I like that.

415
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:37,912
那是什么意思
What was that?

416
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:41,449
当我在伐克斯桌后的箱子里
When I was in the cell behind Vex's desk,

417
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,484
我有很多时间思考
I had a lot of time to think.

418
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,855
我意识到很重要的事
I realized something very important.

419
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,490
你意识到什么
Oh? What did you realize?

420
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,929
我这人太和善
That I've been far too nice.

421
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:57,965
我知道淫妖从我手中逃出
I know that Succubus was somehow behind my capture.

422
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,367
是时候有人捉她归位了
It's time somebody finally put her in her place.

423
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,169
我已经做了
I already did.

424
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:06,206
什么
Excuse me?

425
00:32:08,008 --> 00:32:10,977
她死了 我帮塔米辛摆脱了她
She's gone. I helped Tamsin get rid of her.

426
00:32:11,011 --> 00:32:13,947
为了你 我一直在想
For you. You know, I've been thinking,

427
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:15,815
也许我该回来
maybe I should come back here.

428
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:17,684
我和你又能住一起了
I could live here with you again.

429
00:32:18,018 --> 00:32:21,520
亲爱的
Oh... honey...

430
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,291
可是我在哪养狗啊
but then where would I keep the dogs?

431
00:32:27,962 --> 00:32:29,662
你现在要做什么
What are you gonna do now?

432
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:33,800
既然波死了?
With Bo gone?

433
00:32:38,805 --> 00:32:40,139
无恶不作啊
Everything.

434
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:57,222
- 永远分开 - 什么
- Separate forever! - What?

435
00:32:57,256 --> 00:32:59,424
永远分离 那就是受死精说的
Separate forever. That's what the Jumbee said!

436
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:01,192
我知道我们要做什么了
I know what we have to do!

437
00:33:01,227 --> 00:33:03,228
在他们结婚前被杀了
Before they were married, they were killed!

438
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:04,796
他们分开葬的
They were buried separately!

439
00:33:04,831 --> 00:33:05,964
- 要是我们 - 要是我们怎样
- If we... - If we what?

440
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:07,265
不不 我知道
No, no, I know!

441
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:09,700
如果我们把他们合葬
If we bury them together then it will end

442
00:33:09,735 --> 00:33:11,469
受死精就能瞑目了
the Jumbee's need for vengeance.

443
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:14,472
拜托 你已经千年高寿
Come on, you've been around for a thousand years,

444
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:16,241
难道就不能读本浪漫小说?
and you've never read a romance novel?

445
00:33:16,275 --> 00:33:17,808
你真是个幸运的姑娘
Wow, you are a lucky girl.

446
00:33:17,843 --> 00:33:20,512
把凯西带到楼下 把你们锁起来
Take Kathy downstairs and lock yourselves up.

447
00:33:20,846 --> 00:33:22,847
好好的 好吗?
Be okay, okay?

448
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:25,916
戴森 你得去找他们的墓地 好吗
Dyson, you have to go find their remains, ok?

449
00:33:25,951 --> 00:33:26,917
快去啊
Just please hurry.

450
00:33:26,952 --> 00:33:29,353
我不会离开你的 波 我刚找到你
I'm not leaving you, Bo! I just found you!

451
00:33:29,387 --> 00:33:30,888
我绝不可能
There's no way in hell I'm...

452
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:37,427
- 你相信我吗 - 是的
- Do you trust me? - Yes.

453
00:33:37,462 --> 00:33:40,931
那就相信吧 我能跟她斗争 戴森 你得走了
Then trust this. I can fight her, Dyson, but you have to go.

454
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:43,333
要快点 求你了 走啊
You have to hurry! Please, just go!

455
00:34:06,532 --> 00:34:09,300
这是他腿骨还是受死精的腿骨啊?
Ok, is this his leg bone or the Jumbee's leg bone? 

456
00:34:09,334 --> 00:34:11,569
没关系 反正都要放一起
Doesn't matter. It's all going in the same place.

457
00:34:11,604 --> 00:34:13,838
你跟波都这样约会吗?
Is this how your dates with Bo usually go?

458
00:34:13,873 --> 00:34:16,274
挖坟 救凡人性命?
Digging up graves, and trying to save human lives?

459
00:34:16,308 --> 00:34:20,111
我要说不是 肯定是在撒谎
I'd be lying if I said this didn't have some semblance of nostalgia.

460
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:24,283
好嘞 她跟他的部分都在一起了?
Okay, that's it... are all of his bits with her bits?

461
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:26,750
- 是的 没错 - 是吗?
- Yeah, they are. - Yeah?

462
00:34:28,653 --> 00:34:29,753
帮我制服她
Help me hold her down.

463
00:34:35,326 --> 00:34:39,463
- 把你们都杀掉 我太开心了 - 稳住她
- Oh, I'm gonna enjoy killing you both. - Hold her still...

464
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:43,667
他们从未结婚 因此她不能瞑目
They were never married! That's why she's still stuck in limbo.

465
00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:48,204
如果我们让他们成婚 就会结束痛苦
If we marry them ... maybe it will end the pain...

466
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,341
你在哪找到的
Where did you find these?

467
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:56,813
我愿娶你做我的合法妻子
I take you to be my lawfully wed wife

468
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:59,149
无论健康或疾病 死亡也不能
to have and hold, in sickness and in health,

469
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:00,516
将我们分开
and even in death.

470
00:35:01,352 --> 00:35:05,421
- 你愿意当我的妻子 - 诺亚
- Do you take me to be your... - Noah...

471
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:11,160
你愿意让诺亚做你的丈夫吗
Do you take Noah to be your lawfully wedded husband?

472
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:14,330
无论健康或患病 死亡也不能
To have and to hold, in sickness and in health,

473
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:15,498
将你们分开?
even in death?

474
00:35:16,633 --> 00:35:19,735
我愿意
Yes. I do.

475
00:35:32,482 --> 00:35:34,483
你们在看什么啊?
What are you guys looking at?

476
00:35:35,651 --> 00:35:36,985
你看不到他们?
You can't see them?

477
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:01,108
等等
Wait...

478
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:08,215
- 我们? - 准备好回家了?
- Are we? - Ready to go home?

479
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:12,185
- 当然 - 是啊
- Oh, hells yes. - Yeah.

480
00:36:28,035 --> 00:36:31,270
- 早上好 罗尼! - 接下电话 好吗
- Good morning, Ronny! - Grab the phone, would ya?

481
00:36:31,304 --> 00:36:33,772
有些人每隔十分钟就打来
Some yahoo's been calling every ten minutes or so,

482
00:36:33,806 --> 00:36:36,608
- 询问凯伦- 什么
- asking about some Karen. - What?

483
00:36:36,643 --> 00:36:39,278
说是重金悬赏信息
Yeah. Said there's a big reward for information.

484
00:36:39,312 --> 00:36:41,147
打扰我做准备工作
Hardly had time to do my prep.

485
00:36:43,816 --> 00:36:45,751
你要接吗 红发妹子?
You gonna answer it, Red?

486
00:36:46,486 --> 00:36:48,487
我着急去洗手间
I actually have to go to the washroom.

487
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:01,132
你的拳脚了得啊
Uh, your kicks are gone all ghetto.

488
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:03,349
你想借我的猫咪高跟飞靴吗
Oh, you want to borrow my kitten heel fly boots.

489
00:37:03,406 --> 00:37:05,636
它们太美了 也许会让
They are tris gorge and they might make

490
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:09,541
你这身流浪汉造型
this, um, homeless-persons- nighty-thing you're rockin'

491
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:11,309
增加点时尚元素
look like an actual fashion choice.

492
00:37:11,343 --> 00:37:13,578
你知道为什么我明白你会好好的吗
You know how I know you're gonna be okay?

493
00:37:13,612 --> 00:37:17,248
因为你和我最好的朋友一样勇敢
Because you've got balls as big as my best friend.

494
00:37:17,283 --> 00:37:19,072
- 她是个姑娘 - 哦
- Who is a girl? - Oh...

495
00:37:20,786 --> 00:37:24,254
再见了 宝贝 别太为难他们
Bye, babe. And don't be so hard on them.

496
00:37:24,289 --> 00:37:27,357
有朝一日 你也会面对自己的恶魔
One day you might have to face down your own demons...

497
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:29,060
这就能派上用场
and they might come in handy.

498
00:37:30,462 --> 00:37:33,965
要是需要我 就来找我吧
But if you do ever need me... come find me.

499
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:53,650
- 我要走了 - 什么
- I need to leave. - What?

500
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:56,252
小镇 我要离开小镇了
Town. I need to leave town.

501
00:37:56,286 --> 00:37:58,121
你在说什么 什么时候走
What are you talking about?? Leave when?

502
00:37:58,155 --> 00:38:00,090
现在 我真不能解释
Now! I can't really explain...

503
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:02,792
我跟你一起走 好吗 我能帮忙
I... will come with you, ok? I can help ...

504
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:05,629
不 答应我 要是有人找我
No! Just promise me. If anybody comes looking for me,

505
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:07,430
你要假装从不认识我
you'll pretend that you never knew me.

506
00:38:07,832 --> 00:38:10,767
- 你去哪 别... - 答应我
- Where are you going? Just... - Promise me.

507
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:13,769
保证
Promise.

508
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:20,709
致幸运 我希望你很快能找到好运
For luck. I really hope you find some soon.

509
00:38:22,613 --> 00:38:25,314
等等 还有其他办法离开这吗?
Wait, wait, wait... is there another way out of here?

510
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:26,949
是啊 快走
Yeah. Come on.

511
00:38:28,184 --> 00:38:30,418
都是生病的人 还这么着急?
You're in an awful rush for a sick girl?

512
00:38:30,453 --> 00:38:32,420
我等不及要爬上床了
I just can't wait to get into bed.

513
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,490
要事第一
First thing's first.

514
00:38:38,795 --> 00:38:40,729
西里欧 你想听听看吗?
Clio ... you wanna do that ear thing?

515
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,022
你以为自己在做什么 
What do you think you're doing? 

516
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,602
拿走属于自己的东西
Taking what's mine.

517
00:38:47,637 --> 00:38:49,809
有钱能使鬼推磨 你哥们 
Money talks, and your buddy, 

518
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,439
伐克斯 可有不少钱
Vex, has got boat loads of it.

519
00:38:51,474 --> 00:38:54,209
你真以为你能跟她走吗
Do you really think you're just gonna walk away with her?

520
00:38:54,243 --> 00:38:58,079
这么说吧 你要是跟着我们 或者想阻止我们
Let me put it this way. If you follow us or try to stop me,

521
00:38:58,113 --> 00:39:00,615
我会让异常的痛苦
then I'm gonna let the transcendental sickness

522
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:04,185
在她体内侵蚀她 然后我会离开她
eat her insides and then I'm gonna leave her

523
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:08,289
让她身处淫妖的水深火热吧
in a hot and bloody succubus mess.

524
00:39:08,456 --> 00:39:10,725
我不是说逃离我
I don't mean walk away from me.

525
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:13,895
- 我是说逃离她 - 什么
- I mean walk away from her. - What?

526
00:39:13,929 --> 00:39:16,698
如果我记得没错 受死精也是元素
Last time I checked, Jumbees were Elementals, too.

527
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,801
西里欧 助人为乐终有善报
See, that's the thing about helping people, Clio.

528
00:39:20,835 --> 00:39:23,770
有时因果报复会找上门啦
Sometimes you get paid back with a little thing called Karma.

529
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:26,207
受死精治愈了我
Jumbee already healed me ...

530
00:39:26,241 --> 00:39:29,269
当她在你体内时 看清了你的图谋
and when she was inside of you she saw exactly what you were up to.

531
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:31,063
这只是专业...
This is just professional...

532
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,814
你知道我有多累多讨厌
Do you have any idea how sick and tired I am

533
00:39:33,848 --> 00:39:37,517
被人两面三刀欺骗 愚弄玩耍
of being double crossed and lied to and generally dicked around!

534
00:39:38,352 --> 00:39:40,353
你惹错人了
You picked the wrong girl to screw over.

535
00:39:40,454 --> 00:39:44,224
我这人记仇 记私仇
Because I like to make everything personal.

536
00:39:54,868 --> 00:39:57,803
- 你是什么 - 她是噩梦
- What are you? - She's your worst nightmare.

537
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,544
带着微笑死去
Dying with a smile...

538
00:40:04,578 --> 00:40:08,313
这对你来说命太好了
that is much too good a fate for you.

539
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,455
你离开的时候 有点中世纪的感觉?
Did you get a little medieval while you were away?
