1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,120
"妙警贼探" 前情提要...
Previously on White Collar...

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,120
Mosconi法典
The Mosconi Codex.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,160
这可不是一般的书
This is no ordinary book.

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,060
我觉得Hagen在利用你
I think Hagen is using you.

5
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,400
率先破解出法典是我们
The only chance we have of getting a leg up on him

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,230
扳倒他的唯一机会
is by deciphering the Codex first.

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,330
- Neal开小差了 对吧?  - 没错 他开小差了
- Neal took off, didn't he?  - Yeah, he sure did.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,800
找下他去了哪儿
Find out where he went.

9
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,730
离那个伏特加酒吧一个街区的监控像头
Surveillance cameras a block from the vodka room

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,200
拍到了一个的哥
led us to a cabbie.

11
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,530
会有什么吸引他过来的原因吗?
Is there any reason he'd slip away to come here?

12
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,100
Neal来一定是有原因的
Neal always has a reason.

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,330
你没事吧?
You okay?

14
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,130
直到晚上听到你回家
I can't exhale until I hear you

15
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,200
我才可以松一口气
walk through that door at night.

16
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,730
Siegel探员被人谋杀
Agent Siegel's murder

17
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,800
是一次随机的暴力行动
was a random act of violence.

18
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,630
但不会发生在我身上
But it's not gonna happen to me.

19
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,760
我保证
I promise.

20
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,400
但法典一直以来
But the Codex has been hidden away

21
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,560
都被藏起来
its entire existence.

22
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,860
你怎么弄到副本的?
How did you get a copy?

23
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,160
我们的法典副本是不完整的
Our copy of the codex is incomplete.

24
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,300
你手头有多少?
How much do you have?

25
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,860
只有一章
A single chapter.

26
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,460
第13章
It's Chapter 13.

27
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,700
他所写的所有书中
In all the books he ever produced,

28
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,530
从没出现过第13章
he never wrote a Chapter 13.

29
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,760
新发型 新西装
Haircut, new suit.

30
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,030
今天是什么日子?
What's the occasion?

31
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,160
就在这天
On this very day,

32
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,960
我走进了市中心的一个画廊
I walked into a downtown art gallery

33
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,730
一眼看见了我未来的妻子
and first laid eyes on my future wife.

34
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,960
噢 例行的艺术犯罪案
Ah, routine art crime investigation

35
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,800
变成了你生命中最幸运的一天
turns into the luckiest day of your life.

36
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,930
对啊
I agree.

37
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,130
为了庆祝
And to celebrate,

38
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,060
我们打算去第一次约会的
we're going to the same restaurant

39
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,260
那家餐厅
we went to on our first date.

40
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,330
Papaya King餐厅吗?
Papaya King?

41
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,360
是La Cucina De Tua Nonna餐厅
La Cucina De Tua Nonna.

42
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,930
红酱 秸秆瓶葡萄酒
Red sauce, wine in straw bottles.

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,600
餐巾有塞进领子吗?
Napkin tucked into your collar?

44
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,100
我特别记得所有的纪念日
I'm making it a point to remember all the anniversaries.

45
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,060
生日 婚礼
Birthdays, weddings,

46
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,960
从饲养师那买Satchmo回家的那天
the day we brought Satchmo home from the breeders.

47
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,430
以为是白鹳叼它去你家的
I imagined a stork delivery.

48
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,100
- 是12月7日  - 珍珠港被偷袭那天?
- December 7th.  - Pearl harbor day?

49
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,830
另一个引以为耻的纪念日是
Another day that will live in infamy.

50
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,730
我第一次抓到你那天
First time I arrested you.

51
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,430
嗯 四年之后 我们又重新示范了一次
Hmm, and four years later we did it all over again.

52
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,630
- 对  - 但是这次
- Yeah.  - But this time,

53
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,560
- 你送我脚链了  - 对了 
- You gave me jewelry.  - Oh.

54
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,960
所以我叫你来
Which is why I asked you to meet me here.

55
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,060
上次在伏特加酒吧的秘密行动
I removed your anklet

56
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,630
我去掉你的脚铐
for our undercover operation at the vodka room.

57
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,100
不久 我就发现这了
Soon after, I found this.

58
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,510
办公室里不是有无数支这样的笔吗?
Don't we have hundreds of those back at the office?

59
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,020
我觉得这支有特殊意义
I wonder this has special significance

60
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,000
第56街的办公楼 Brivege Coral诊所
Office building, 56 streets, Brivege Coral practic.

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,350
我们的下个案子吗?
Our next case?

62
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,440
可能是我一个人的
It could be mine.

63
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,430
我随叫随到
I am here to help.

64
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,520
你可以回家了
You can go home now.

65
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,640
这年头 别再点秸秆瓶葡萄酒了 试试桑娇维塞
This year, skip the straw bottle wine. Spring for some sangiovese.

66
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,680
我平常吃什么就点什么
I will order what I always order.

67
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,700
我下载到了手机上 这样就能一直看了
I downloaded it to my phone so I'd always have it with me.

68
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,960
我仍旧喜欢意大利菜
I still love Italian.

69
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,900
我仍旧爱你
I still love you.

70
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,330
你第一次做标志就是为我做的吗?
So am I the first guy you ever made a sign for?

71
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,660
那是第一个没有写"滚开"的标志
It was the first sign that didn't say "go away."

72
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,430
噢 那也不会阻挠我
Oh, it wouldn't have discouraged me.

73
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,330
你有没有想过如果那天没有走进我的画廊
Did you ever think where you would be

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,160
你现在会在哪里吗?
if you didn't walk into my gallery that day?

75
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,860
没有 从没想过
Nope. Never.

76
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,530
太可怕了 不敢想
Too scary to think about.

77
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,730
工作上的事怎样? 有进展吗?
How's work going? Getting any better?

78
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,130
有 我们把Siegel的照片挂在荣誉墙上了
Yeah, we added Siegel's picture to the honor wall.

79
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,630
那也算是进展吧
That was something, at least.

80
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,460
喂 这是在庆祝什么?
Hey, what kind of celebration is this?

81
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,800
- 都没酒了  - 谢谢
- Glasses are almost empty.  - Thank you.

82
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,730
- 打扰下  - 噢
- Scusi.  - Oh.

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,660
我们没点这些
We didn't order these.

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,600
怎么了? 你认识她吗?
What's wrong? Do you know her?

85
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,830
应该认识
I think I do.

86
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,460
那是Jill
That's Jill.

87
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,630
哪个Jill
Jill.

88
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,030
匡提科那个
From Quantico.

89
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,500
她就是Jill啊?
Oh, that's Jill?

90
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,200
对 我的前女友
Right. My ex-girlfriend.

91
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,630
- Peter 你好  - 你好
- Peter.  - Yes.

92
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,130
好久不见
It's been a long time.

93
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,760
20年没见了
20 years long.

94
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,360
没想到今晚在这见到你
I never thought I'd see you here, tonight.

95
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,600
我跟踪你来的
I hunted you down.

96
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,960
噢
Oh.

97
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,730
这是我妻子Elizabeth
This is my wife, Elizabeth.

98
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,160
很高兴认识你
It's great to meet you.

99
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,000
等下 我好像打断你们了
Uh, wait, I've interrupted something.

100
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,560
没有
Oh, no.

101
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,260
只是个平常的周二晚上 对吧?
This is just an average Tuesday night for us, right?

102
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,430
来 坐下 一起吧
Come on, sit down. Join us.

Okay.

105

那你在纽约做什么呢?
So, um, what are you doing in New York?

106
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,760
我在调查一个案子 就来找你
I'm on a case. I'd look you up.

107
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,260
你怎么找到我的?
How'd you find me?

108
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,160
找人是我的职业 Peter
That's what I do, Peter.

109
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,530
你还在SSG吗?
You still in SSG?

110
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,530
至少现在还是
Last time I checked in.

111
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,400
什么是SSG?
What's SSG?

112
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,660
SSG就是特别监督小组

114
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,660
记录下他们的惺忪
record 'em if we can.

115
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,100
听起来很牛
Sounds fascinating.

116
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,430
- 你还喝波旁威士忌吗?  - 偶尔吧
- You still drink bourbon?  - On occasion.

117
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,100
这种酒真是超级特别
Well, this is a damn special one.

118
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,200
你喝吗? 
How about you?

119
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,800
好啊
Sure, why not?

记得我们怎么敬酒吗?
Remember our toast?

为了真理 正义...
Truth, justice...

这就是我家
Here it is.

127

每次经过这个房子
Every time I pass this house

128
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,400
我都忍不住想敲门 看看里面
I was tempted to knock and ask for a look inside.

129
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,760
你早该进来了
Oh, you should have.

130
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,630
我的女房东会邀请你进来喝咖啡的
My landlady would have invited you in for coffee.

131

God, it's like a good book I'm finally getting to read.

132
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,560
真不敢相信你住在这
I can't believe you live here.

133
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,030
我只是租了书的后记
Well, I just rent the epilogue.

134
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,000
我倒杯酒给你好吗?
Can I get you a glass of wine?

135
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,560
联邦调查局探员工作时可以喝酒吗?
FBI agents are allowed to drink on the job?

136
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,000
我们无时无刻都在工作
Well, we're always on the job.

137
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,360
有选择吗?
What choice do we have?

138
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,230
现在你加入我们了
And now that you're joining us,

139
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,130
我也要让你腐败下
I'm gonna corrupt you too.

140
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,430
- 谢谢  - 嗯
- Thank you.  - Mm hmm.

141
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,460
你们诡异的第13章在哪?
So where's this phantom Chapter 13 of yours?

142
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,760
在这
Right here.

143
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,360
不可能
It can't be.

144
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,560
为什么? 有问题吗?
Why? What's wrong?

145
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,460
这是真的 所以才有问题
What's wrong is that it's right.

146
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,200
这... 这... 这是Mosconi 但不可能的
It's... It... It's a Mosconi, but that's impossible.

147
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,700
这就是他创作的唯一第13章了
That would make it the only Chapter 13 that he ever made.

148
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,860
是从放在Gershon博物馆的法典上
Well, it was copied directly from the Codex

149
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,160
直接复制下来的
at the Gershon museum.

150
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,760
这可是他的笔迹
It is his handwriting.

151
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,030
太不可思议了
This is crazy.

152
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,830
还有这
And this.

153
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,400
这里
Here.

154
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,060
这是一幅画的草稿
It's a study for a painting

155
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,660
这本书发布一年后
That he didn't put on canvas

156
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,630
他才画到画布上
until a year after this was published.

157
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,200
所以这些页不可能是其它人伪造的
So these pages, they couldn't have been done by anyone else.

158
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,230
一定是他在纽约时创作的
And this has to be from his New York period.

159
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,430
1886年
1886.

160
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,160
他待在这的时间不超过一年
He was here less than a year.

161
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,800
联邦调查局的艺术犯罪案数据库显示的
FBI art crimes database.

162
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,760
可能他还在纽约写了这章唯一的第13章
Maybe he wrote his only chapter 13 in New York as well.

163
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,160
Mosconi匆匆回意大利了
Well, Mosconi rushed back to Italy in a hurry.

164
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,830
为什么匆匆离开还是一个谜
The why he ran is a mystery.

165
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,900
他留给我们这本书就更是一个谜了
And the book he left us is more of a what than a why.

166
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,200
他是个莫名其妙的人 喜欢拼图
He was a puzzling man who loved puzzles.

167
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,160
Mosconi相信如果一个人想要真相
See, Mosconi believed that if someone wanted the truth,

168
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,230
就应该去找
they should have to search for it.

169
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,060
你... 你在干什么?
What... what are you doing?

170
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,860
如果这本书是一个拼图 这些可能是拼块
If this book is a puzzle, maybe these are the pieces.

171
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,330
看
Look at that.

172
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
过来
Come here.

173
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,700
天啊
Oh, my gosh.

174
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,600
这是一块
Here's one.

175
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,530
中间那块在哪?
Where's the middle?

176
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,000
肯定就在这里面
It's gotta be here somewhere.

177
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,560
不可思议
It's incredible.

178
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,730
看上去像一个彩色玻璃窗
It looks like a stained glass window.

179
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,830
但如果他是在纽约写第13章的
But if he wrote Chapter 13 when he was in New York,

180
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,400
这个彩色玻璃窗
this stained glass window

181
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,930
肯定就在曼哈顿
could be right here in Manhattan.

182
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,900
你... 你知道你刚做了什么吗?
Do you... do you realize what you've just done?

183
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,400
随便翻折了法典?
Made a mess of the Codex?

184
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,630
不 我... 我觉得你可能
No, I... I think you might have just made

185
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,700
找到了数十年来Mosconi研究
one of the most important discoveries

186
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,160
最重要的发现之一
on Mosconi in decades.

187
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,630
工作到深夜呢?
Ah, working into the night?

188
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,900
真不错
Impressive.

189
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,830
你该知道联邦调查局不赞成加班
You should know the FBI frowns on overtime.

190
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,200
我们... 我们有了惊人的进步 长官
Uh, We... we've made incredible progress, sir.

191
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,500
对
Yes.

192
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,700
Caffrey探员会告诉你进展的
I'm gonna let Agent Caffrey fill you in.

193
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,660
好的 我还要...
Sure. You know, I'm gonna...

194
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,860
调查这个窗
research this window.

195
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,230
看下能否找到地方
See if I can find out where it is.

196
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,300
好的 我也会利用联邦调查局的资源
Yeah, I'll put my FBI resources on it as well.

197
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,700
看下谁先找到
We can see who finds it first.

198
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,630
好
'Kay.

199
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,400
怎么了?
What?

200
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,330
你 工作 和女人... 罪恶的三角组合
You, business, and women... The unholy trinity.

201
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,330
Rebecca只是在做法典的事
Rebecca is all about the business of the Codex.

202
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,430
我以前没见识过吗
Oh, like I've never seen this before.

203
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,360
有Kate 有Alex 还有Sarah
Kate, Alex, Sarah.

204
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,100
现在轮到Rebecca了
Now Rebecca.

205
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
肯定不止研究法典这么简单
There's more behind this than the Codex.

206
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,930
你现在是爱情专家了对吧?
So you're an expert on romance now?

207
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,760
一个在恋爱上不智而过于深情的人
One who has loved not wisely, but too well.

208
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,930
奥赛罗(莎士比亚四大悲剧之一)
Othello.

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,930
是 我们都知道他结局如何
Yeah. We all know how that turned out.

210
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,360
你没事吧?
You okay?

211
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,930
回来的路上一句话都没说
Pretty quiet on the way home.

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,960
嗯 我不想打破咒语
Well, I didn't wanna break the spell.

213
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,900
听我说 亲爱的
Oh, look, honey.

214
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,600
Jill向我挑战
Jill challenged me.

215
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,930
你知道我去匡蒂科的时候
You know that I didn't enter Quantico

216
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,100
没那么自信的
all that sure of myself.

217
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,900
但是她竭尽全力胜过我
But she tried so hard to beat me

218
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
而我为了胜过她 也是用尽全力
That I worked my butt off to beat her.

219
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,530
- 然后...  - 看看你现在的成就
- And...  - Look at you now.

220
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,330
不是 我不是那个意思
No, that's not what I meant.

221
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,260
只是... 只是我从未想过
It's... It's just that I never thought

222
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,400
我会有今天的成就
that I could finish as high as I did.

223
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,360
你知道的
You know that.

224
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,760
我会有今天的成就 全是因为你
You're the reason I'm the man I am today.

225
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,230
接着说
Continue.

226
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,160
嗯
Hmm.

227
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,360
没有你 我去年不知道怎么熬过来
I couldn't have gotten through this past year without you.

228
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,960
也许... 年年都是如此
Or... any year.

229
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,730
不管怎样 今天是我们的纪念日啊
You know, it's still our anniversary.

230
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,660
我正希望你这样说呢
I was hoping you'd say that.

231
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,260
谢谢你 探长
Thank you, Detective.

232
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,800
是的 嗯 希望如此
Right, well, let's hope it does.

233
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,460
再见 交给我们吧
Bye. We'll take it from here.

234
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,830
纽约市警察局打来的
That was NYPD.

235
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,760
两天前有人在布鲁克林强占车辆
Two days ago someone in Brooklyn commandeered a vehicle

236
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,430
自称是联邦调查局的
Posing as an FBI agent.

237
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,030
昨天又发生了一起
Yesterday he struck again.

238
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,630
- 他出示证件了吗?  - 出示了
- Did he flash a badge?  - Mm-hmm.

239
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,630
纽约警察局不知道是真是假
NYPD doesn't know if it's real or not.

240
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,160
也许是Siegel的
Or if it could be Siegel's.

241
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,230
可能性不大
Chances are slight that it is,

242
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,960
但是我们也要查一下
but we need to check it out.

243
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,430
可能是两周来第一个有用的线索
Could be our first solid lead in two weeks.

244
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,730
我想让你和Jones去查
I want you and Jones on this.

245
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,860
我信任的两个
Two people I trust.

246
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,900
我信任的一个半吧
Well, 1 1/2.

247
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,460
那是谁?
Who is that?

248
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,760
啊 不重要
Uh, no one important.

249
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,260
找到线索 抓住这个人
Come up with something to catch this guy.

250
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,760
- 出去吧  - 你似乎很紧张
- Now go.  - You seem nervous.

251
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,560
出去吧 出去
Just leave, just leave.

252
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,830
嘿
Hey.

253
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,060
你是Neal Caffrey
Neal Caffrey.

254
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,430
我们认识吗?
Do we know each other?

255
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,260
我叫Jill Stone 我熬了一晚上
Jill Stone. I stayed up all night

256
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,860
看你俩的案件卷宗
reading the case files of you two.

257
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,030
想不看都不行
Couldn't put it down.

258
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,560
好东西让你好久难以入睡
The good ones keep you up at night.

259
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,360
没错 坏的让你更久难以入睡
Mm-hmm. The bad ones even longer.

260
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,230
他正要出去呢
He was just leaving.

261
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,200
没想到你会来
I wasn't expecting you.

262
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,300
我们比较神秘
We're a secretive bunch.

263
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,530
别告诉我咱俩看到的不一样
Tell me we're looking at the same thing.

264
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Peter Burke有些不安
Peter Burke uncomfortable.

265
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,730
那不是他的正常状态
That's not his natural state.

266
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,500
你知道她是联邦调查局的吗?
You know she's FBI?

267
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,700
嗯 穿的不是一般般的西装
Well, it's not your run of the mill suit.

268
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,730
不知道她平时穿什么
Not that she ever wears one.

269
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,560
看她的举止
Look at the way she holds herself.

270
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,160
锋芒毕露
Open. Totally exposed.

271
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,260
非常有自信
Confidence and plenty of it.

272
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,800
喔 她那样摸他
Ooh. Oh, that's not the first time

273
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,430
已经不是第一次了
She's touched him like that.

274
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,900
- 嗯嗯  - 他们有段情史
- Uh-uh.  - They have a past.

275
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,860
看她的眼睛 一直注视着他
Look at her eyes. All over his face.

276
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,300
嗯 她想知道他对她还有没有感觉
Yeah, she wants to see if he still feels anything.

277
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,100
嗯嗯
Uh-huh.

278
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,560
- 喔  - 怎么了?
- Whoa.  - Whoa what?

279
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,260
- 他们上过床  - Peter吗?
- They slept together.  - Peter?

280
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,330
不是最近的事
Not recently.

281
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,460
好吧 我听说
All right, you know I heard

282
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,760
他在匡蒂科的时候
he had a pretty serious relationship

283
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,500
跟一个女探员认真交往过
with a female agent down at Quantico.

284
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,600
后来她加入了SSG
She joined SSG.

285
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,500
联邦调查局的中央情报局吗?
The CIA of the FBI?

286
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,860
那些是很牛逼的探员
Those are some badass agents.

287
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,330
怪不得这么有自信
That explains the confidence.

288
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,860
那是Peter的前女友
That's Peter's ex.

289
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,100
一定是
It has to be.

290
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,400
我不能在你妻子面前跟你谈案件的事
I couldn't talk about the case in front of your wife.

291
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,960
跟精英调查小组有关的吗?
White Collar related?

292
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,030
我在查一个叫Mason Sadowski的科学怪才
I'm tracking a tech genius named Mason Sadowski.

293
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,700
不怎么吓人啊
Doesn't look all that intimidating.

294
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,930
但在当今社会 这种人最麻烦
In today's world that's what trouble looks like.

295
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,500
他是一个团队的成员
He's part of a team that invented

296
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,500
这个团队为我们的一位高层国防承包商
a new and extremely dangerous microchip

297
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,230
新发明了一种极度危险的微型芯片
for one of our top defense contractors.

298
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,130
然后他变卦了吗?
Then he decided he didn't wanna share?

299
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,100
是的
Exactly.

300
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,730
这芯片一定非常重要
Must be a very important chip.

301
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,000
跟破解密码有关
Something to do with decoding passwords.

302
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,900
有了它 就连三脚猫的黑客都可以破解
With it, a two-bit hacker could break through

303
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,900
我们最复杂强大的安全墙
our most sophisticated security walls.

304
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,630
我们的敌人最想得到的
Low-hanging fruit for our enemies.

305
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,800
是的 他把东西放到了黑市上
Yeah, he put it on the black market.

306
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,400
我已经建立了一个假身份 伊朗的经纪人
I've established a cover I.D. as a broker for Iran.

307
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,730
下了饵了吗?
Set the hook yet?

308
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,500
- 他已经上钩了  - 很好
- He swallowed it.  - Good.

309
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,930
等着交易的时候抓住他
Waiting for a buy time to reel him in.

310
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,930
我的问题是:
My problem: most buyers

311
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,560
大部分买主是两个人代表外国集团
representing foreign interests come in twos.

312
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,060
按照行规 我需要一个帮手
In order for the ruse to work, I need a partner.

313
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,230
有卧底经验的
Someone with undercover experience.

314
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,330
你又信得过的人
Someone you can trust.

315
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,800
在纽约 你最合适
More than any other agent in New York.

316
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,030
头儿Bruce Hawes已经批准了
Section chief Bruce Hawes put the order through personally.

317
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,230
哦 Bruce啊?
Oh, Bruce, huh?

318
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,460
不只是Bruce
Not only Bruce.

319
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,960
你的名声在华盛顿也响当当
Your name gets dropped a lot in Washington.

320
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,630
听上去不错
Nice to hear.

321
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,760
你熟悉纽约 我不熟悉
You know New York, and I don't have GPS.

322
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,430
另外除了我 你是最好的
Besides, you're the best. Next to me, of course.

323
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,530
哦 那是在匡提科 现在是现在
Oh, that was Quantico. This is now.

324
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,900
我会安排好交易
I'll set up the buy.

325
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,130
好戏上场了
This is gonna be fun.

326
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,600
明白了
Got that too. Here.

327
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,760
- 很高兴见到你  - 保重
- Good to see you.  - Take care.

328
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,200
拜
Bye.

329
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,330
她令Peter浮想联翩啊
She left Peter with a lot to think about.

330
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,360
没错
Uh-huh.

331
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,960
回去工作!
Get back to work!

332
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,330
而且还是很紧张
And still uncomfortable.

333
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,100
- 噢 嘿 你的计划要推后了  - 为什么?
- Oh, hey, you got plans later?  - Why?

334
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,260
特别探员主管让咱们去执行另一个任务
ASAC gave us an assignment.

335
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,660
纽约警察局通知Peter
NYPD informed Peter

336
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,160
有人在布鲁克林用了Siegel的证件
someone may be using Siegel's badge in Brooklyn.

337
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,830
好的 我会联系纽约警察局
All right, I'll coordinate with NYPD.

338
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,700
我们需要罪犯的资料和他的外贸特点
We'll need the perp's description and his m.o.

339
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,960
才能知道我们要找的是谁
So we know what we're looking for.

340
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,700
或许想办法让他找到我们
Or we help him find us.

341
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,930
Jill只是需要我帮忙的联邦调查局探员
Jill's just an FBI agent who needs help on a case.

342
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,030
就这些 没了
That's it. End of story.

343
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,560
你从来不会用那种眼神看Jones
You never look at Jones like that.

344
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,530
- 够了  - 等一下
- Drop it.  - Hold on a second.

345
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,400
El知道你前女友是你的新搭档吗?
Does El know that your old ex is your new partner?

346
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,800
待时机成熟 今晚我就会告诉她
I'm gonna tell her tonight when it's more relaxed.

347
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,800
好吧 至少告诉我细节
All right, at least give up the details.

348
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,060
你俩是怎么分手的?
What broke you two lovers up?

349
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,130
我也不知道
I don't know.

350
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,530
道不同不相为谋吧
She went west, I went east.

351
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,260
这已经不重要了
It doesn't matter anymore.

352
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,260
- 这当然重要了 - 不 重要的是...
- It always matters.  - No, what matters...

353
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,260
你得抓到那个盗用证件的家伙
is that you catch the guy flashing the badge.

354
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,860
好吧 今晚我和Jones就扮成羊
All right, Jones and I are gonna cruise Brooklyn tonight

355
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,160
去布鲁克林 但是...
in sheep's clothing, but...

356
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,430
但是什么?
But what?

357
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,760
狼也要找肥硕的羊
The wolves need a sleeker wardrobe.

358
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,600
好吧
Yes.

359
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,060
先送我回家
Drop me off.

360
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,030
晚饭快好了
Dinner's almost ready.

361
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,800
嗯
Mm.

362
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,230
- 嗨 - 嗨
- Hi. - Hi.

363
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,100
Jill今天来我办公室了
Jill came to my office today.

364
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,060
我猜到了她早晚会去
I figured she would.

365
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,460
为什么不给我倒杯葡萄酒
Why don't you pour me a glass of wine

366
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,130
告诉我你们谈了点什么?
and tell me all about it?

367
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,030
这种葡萄酒?
What kind of wine is this?

368
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,960
噢 那是去年圣诞节Mozzie给咱们的
Oh, that's the bottle Mozzie gave us last Christmas

369
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,560
- 你当时还不敢打开  - 现在我也不敢
- you were afraid to open.  - Still am.

370
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,000
- 你请客人来家了?  - 没有
- You expecting someone?  - No.

371
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,700
噢... 嗨 Elizabeth
Oh... Hi, Elizabeth.

372
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,200
哇 闻上去像是在意大利菜
Um, wow, it smells like Italy in here.

373
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,800
我都忘了现在还有人会做饭
I forgot people still make dinner.

374
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,930
我忘了还有人不请自来
I forgot people just drop by.

375
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,960
真不好意思打扰你们了
I'm so sorry I keep interrupting you.

376
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,030
我应该先打电话的 但是我们现在有要紧的事儿
I should have called first, but we're just kind of in a rush.

377
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,500
- "我们"?  - 哦 Peter
- "we"?  - Oh, Peter.

378
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,900
我知道他们藏在哪儿了
I found where the guy's holed up,

379
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,000
所以现在我们要去调查下
so we gotta do recon on the thing now, right now.

380
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,430
你们现在一起工作?
You guys workin' on a case together?

381
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,560
这就是Jill来纽约的原因
That's why Jill is in New York

382
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,700
因为案子属于精英调查小组...
and since it was White Collar related...

383
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,200
- 什么案子?  - 是机密
- What's it about?  - Mm, it's classified.

384
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,430
好吧 我们只在这所房子里讨论
Oh, well, nothing we discuss ever leaves this house.

385
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,700
对不起 亲爱的
I'm sorry, hon.

386
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,260
我们不能透露这个
We can't discuss this one.

387
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,600
- 你还好吧?  - 我为什么不好?
- You okay?  - Why wouldn't I be?

388
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,560
回家的路上我打给你
I'll call you on my way home.

389
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,200
我会让他安全回家的
I'll try to get him home in one piece.

390
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,130
好吧
Yeah.

391
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,300
你住在车里?
Do you live in this?

392
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,930
有时是必须的
When I have to.

393
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,560
车里少了个冰箱和电炉
All you're missing is a fridge and a hot plate.

394
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,860
是吧 我正准备放进来
Well, I'm thinking about putting in

395
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,330
- 还有有壁炉和浴缸  - 不错
- A fireplace and Jacuzzi.  - That'd be nice.

396
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,260
你怎么还在出外勤?
How come you're still in the field?

397
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,400
我是说 过去你可是很有野心的
I mean, you had big ambitions way back then.

398
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,300
我还以为你已经是副局长了
I expected you to be assistant director by now.

399
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,100
我有机会去华盛顿了
I'm on a Washington track.

400
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,560
所以这段时间 我身兼双职
For the time being, I'm serving double duty.

401
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,360
特别探员主管和Neal的负责人
ASAC and Neal's handler.

402
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,330
我做得很开心
I'm pretty happy doing both.

403
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,800
- Peter...  - 怎么了?
- Peter...  - What?

404
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,630
你不用在我面前逞强
You don't have to put up a strong front for me.

405
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,030
你曾经是一名探员的上司 结果他被杀了
You were the supervisor of an agent who got killed.

406
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,860
我知道你很受伤
I know you're hurting.

407
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,400
大家都是
The entire bureau is.

408
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,030
是啊
Yeah.

409
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,900
这段记忆很难抹去
It's been hard to shake it.

410
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,060
八年前我失去了我的搭档
I lost my partner eight years ago.

411
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:11,160
现在还忘不了
Still can't.

412
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,730
坐在好车里追捕犯人
Cruisin' for the bad guy in a sweet ride,

413
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,360
- 跟Crockett和Tubbs一样  - 没错
- just like Crockett and Tubbs.  - Ah.

414
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,700
现在真是身处梦中
I am living the dream.

415
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,330
你难道是根据"迈阿密风云"规划的未来?
Did you base your entire future on Miami Vice?

416
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,600
希尔街的布鲁斯 警花拍档...
Ah, Hill Street Blues, Cagney & Lacey...

417
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,030
所有关于警察的电视剧
any show about law enforcement.

418
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,600
我的观点截然不同
I had a different perspective.

419
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,360
我来猜猜 赞助坏蛋吗?
Let me guess, rooting for the bad guys?

420
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,930
只会在他们善良时帮他们 Cagney
Only when they were good, Cagney.

421
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,860
我们已经兜风了三个小时
We've been driving around for about three hours.

422
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,960
这家伙在哪儿?
Where is this guy?

423
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,230
我们当时在追捕在Pomona抢劫银行的一对夫妻
We were chasing a couple that robbed a bank in Pomona.

424
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,260
他们分头逃跑了 我追那个男人
They split up. I followed the guy.

425
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,200
Earl去追那个女的 她假装投降
Earl was following the girl. She pretended to surrender.

426
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,230
向他开了枪
She shot him.

427
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,300
所以你现在都单独办案?
Is that why you work alone?

428
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,800
虽然并不是我的错 但感觉还是我的责任
It wasn't my fault, but it still feels like it was.

429
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,030
Siegel原本会来我的办公室
Siegel used to come to my office

430
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,330
就只是想听我讲以前办的案子
and just wanna hear about my old cases.

431
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,730
他总是听不够
He couldn't get enough.

432
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,230
我把他从芝加哥调过来
I brought him here from Chicago.

433
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,460
保护David是我的责任
David was my responsibility.

434
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,430
保护不了所有人
Can't protect everybody.

435
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,660
没错
No.

436
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,660
还没法替代他们的位置
And you can't take their place.

437
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,600
哪怕有时候你非常想这么做
Even though sometimes you wish you could.

438
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,630
对
Mm.

439
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,330
找到凶手了吗?
Any closer to finding the killer?

440
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,030
还没有
Not yet.

441
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,460
但今天有了条线索
Today we got a potential lead.

442
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,560
你会抓到凶手的
You'll find him.

443
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:33,230
正义并非一直会来得那么快
Justice is not always as swift as we want it to be.

444
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,260
那是我们要找的人吗?
Isn't that our guy?

445
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,100
没错 他出来了 我们的机会来了
Yeah, he's out of his room. Now's our chance.

446
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,860
- 怎么了?  - 我也不知道
- What?  - I don't know.

447
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,600
感觉不太妙
Bad feeling.

448
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,200
希望我们别在犯人出现前就被劫了
I hope we don't get jacked before our perp shows up.

449
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,900
等等
Hold on a second.

450
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,460
等等 你在做什么?
Whoa, what are you doing?

451
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,200
你知道Peter不喜欢别人碰他的按钮的
You know Peter doesn't like folks touching his buttons.

452
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,360
只是想换个好点的视野
Trying to get a better view.

453
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,300
看来你的期待要成真了
Looks like your hope is about to come true.

454
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,530
- 看你左边  - 是吗?
- On your left.  - Yeah?

455
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,460
我需要征用你们的车
I need your car.

456
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,300
- 联邦调查局在办案  - 好的
- Official FBI business.  - Yep.

457
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,900
快点下车! 罪犯要逃走了
Get out now! Criminal's getting away.

458
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,300
- 冷静点 伙计!  - 我们要怎样
- Chill, man!  - How are we

459
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,960
领回这辆车?
gonna get our car back?

460
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,960
真的联邦调查局
Real FBI.

461
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,800
把手放在车顶上
Hands on the roof.

462
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,160
怎么样?
What do you got?

463
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,430
如果我没穿高跟鞋 肯定能追上你
I would have had you if I wore flats.

464
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
以前可没见你找借口过
Well, I never knew you to make excuses before.

465
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,300
好吧 这次算你赢了
Okay, you won that one.

466
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,960
好好品味 因为这会是最后一次
Savor it, because it'll be your last.

467
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,360
好吧
Okay.

468
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,030
谢谢你让我们进来 新婚蜜月
Thanks for letting us in. Honeymooners, right?

469
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,360
总会忘拿些东西
Always forgetting something.

470
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,960
没关系 先生
Si, senor.

471
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,700
好了 我们找块地方藏枪
Come on, let's find a place to stash the gun

472
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,500
以免他在交易前搜我们的身
in case we get patted down before the buy.

473
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,900
你觉得他随身带着芯片吗?
You think he took the chip with him?

474
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,330
如果我这么认为 早就在外面逮捕他了
If I thought so, I would have taken him outside.

475
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,460
也许他藏在了这儿
Then maybe he left it here.

476
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,600
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

477
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,100
我们离开匡蒂科的时候
You could have had any assignment you wanted

478
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,260
你哪儿都能去
when we left Quantico.

479
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,530
为什么选了洛杉矶?
Why Los Angeles?

480
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,900
那辆车看着很眼熟
Hey, that looks familiar.

481
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,800
没错
Yeah.

482
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,700
跟我们进去时遇到的一样
Same guys we passed on our way in.

483
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,130
他们也许也是来买芯片的竞争者
They might be competitive shoppers for our chip.

484
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,500
我们看看他们是谁
Let's find out who they are.

485
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,500
假装是在约会的情侣 拍张自拍
Take a selfie like we're a couple on a date.

486
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,500
好了 再近点
Come on, closer.

487
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,400
得装得像些
We gotta sell it.

488
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,300
Neal 抓到了吗?
Neal, you got him?

489
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,700
你把流血不止的他留在了人行道上
You left him bleeding on the sidewalk.

490
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,030
胸部中弹
A bullet in his chest.

491
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,460
- 他是个联邦调查局探员  - 跟我们一样
- An FBI agent.  - One of us.

492
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,600
我没杀那家伙
I didn't kill the dude.

493
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,030
我拿了他的证件 把枪丢进了垃圾桶
I pulled that badge and gun outta the trash.

494
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,930
我发誓
I swear.

495
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,730
要知道 杀人犯发誓的时候
You know, when a murderer swears,

496
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,500
我总不会相信他们的
I tend not to believe them.

497
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,730
那是个星期五
It was a Friday.

498
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,400
大概一个月前 人们去存政府补贴支票的时候
About a month ago. When people cash their g-checks.

499
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,900
是吗?
Oh, yeah?

500
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,760
几点钟?
What time of day was it?

501
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,860
挺晚了 天快黑了
Later. Almost dark.

502
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,430
之前你在哪儿? 三点到四点的时候
Where were you before that? Between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m.?

503
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,430
我... 我不记得了
I... I don't remember.

504
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,800
"不记得了" 知道吗?
"I don't remember". Well, you know what?

505
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,960
因为你拿了证件 还拿了枪
It doesn't matter because you've got the badge

506
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,160
所以也无所谓了
and you've got the gun.

507
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,460
上面都是你的指纹
And your prints are all over them.

508
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,430
你肯定会坐牢的
You're going down for this.

509
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,460
我们走吧
Let's go.

510
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,860
- 我很期待  - 不 等等
- My skin is starting to crawl.  - No, wait, wait.

511
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,900
那家伙被杀的时候 我在Dante酒铺里
When your guy got hit, I was inside Dante's Liquor.

512
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
待了一个小时?
For an hour?

513
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,430
想等人走光了 再抢一票
Waited till it emptied out so I could rob it.

514
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,200
存支票那天 酒铺总会有很多人 现金也多
The place was crowded and full of cash on check day.

515
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,400
听着 你们可以去查
Look, check it out.

516
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,760
那家店有监控录像 这可做不了假
The store's got cameras. They don't lie.

517
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,400
进去盯着他
Get in there with him.

518
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,600
快点去酒铺 我要看监控录像
Head down to the liquor store. I wanna see that footage.

519
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,800
好的
Yeah.

520
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,330
听着 你已经让他坦白了
Look, you got him to talk.

521
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,730
嘿 Peter
Peter.

522
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,700
你已经尽力了
You did everything you could.

523
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,800
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

524
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,200
你还没睡?
You're awake?

525
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,230
我一直都会等你的
I always wait up for you.

526
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,360
有时候你也会睡着
Well, sometimes you fall asleep.

527
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,900
但这次没有
Not this time.

528
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,830
都告诉我吧
Tell me all about it.

529
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,800
这是机密
It's classified.

530
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,400
得了吧
Oh, come on.

531
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,930
Jill又不会发现的
It's not like jill will ever find out.

532
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,200
我不能说
I can't.

533
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,860
我们一直都讨论你在查的案子的
We always discuss your cases.

534
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:57,060
我知道 但... 我也很想告诉你
I know, but I... And I can't wait to tell you about it.

535
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,600
但... 得等案子结束了
But... not until it's done.

536
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,560
这个案子有什么特别的?
What's so special about this one?

537
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,100
抱歉 这...
I'm sorry, it's...

538
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,000
是机密
Classified.

539
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,930
你明白的 对吧?
You understand, right?

540
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,300
我当然明白
Of course I do.

541
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,760
我可是警嫂
I'm an FBI wife.

542
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,230
面部识别系统
Facial recognition scan

543
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,260
辨认出他们是Eric Healey和Robert Bly
fegged them as Eric Healey and Robert Bly.

544
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,230
都是前秘密组织成员
They're both ex-black ops.

545
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,500
他们现在是自由职业
They've been freelancing

546
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,900
为我们不太熟悉的国防承包商工作
for some of our lesser known defense contractors.

547
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,460
他们是高级雇佣兵
They're high-end mercenaries.

548
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,930
没错 看起来我们并不是唯一
Yeah, it does look like we're not the only ones

549
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,760
在找这个天才的人
hunting our genius.

550
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,500
对手国防承包商
Rival defense contractors

551
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,860
会不择手段想弄到芯片
would do anything for that technology.

552
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,000
我觉得这些家伙想成为新卖家
I think these guys are looking to be the new sellers.

553
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,400
这就意味着他们不会买芯片
Which means they're not gonna buy it.

554
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,330
而回去偷
They're gonna steal it.

555
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,300
嘿 Elizabeth Burke
Hey, Elizabeth Burke.

556
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,130
用棕色袋子装的爱心礼物
Bearing gifts in a brown paper bag.

557
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,230
想想就羡慕
I can only imagine.

558
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,300
这只是他的午餐
Oh, it's just his lunch.

559
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,300
他早上忘带了
He forgot it this morning.

560
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,800
你怎么没参加?
Why aren't you in there?

561
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,200
他们觉得我没必要知道
Uh, scratched off the need to know list.

562
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,200
我也是
Yeah, me too.

563
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,660
来吧 我们一起进去
Come on, let's go in.

564
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,630
不了 Neal 我不是那种多疑的妻子
No, Neal, I'm not that kind of wife.

565
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,530
我绝对就是那种线人
Well, I'm definitely that kind of C.I.

566
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,560
不用了 我就把东西放在他桌上了
No, I'll just leave it on his desk.

567
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,300
好吧
All right.

568
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,330
你觉得这个Jill怎么样?
What do we think of this Jill?

569
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,660
还需要再观察观察
There's need for further study.

570
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,030
我觉得她很孤独
I think she's lonely.

571
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,830
她住在一辆86年的雪佛兰里
Well, she lives out of an '86 chevy.

572
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,330
我觉得她不会参加很多晚宴
I doubt she throws a lot of dinner parties.

573
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,330
从没结过婚
She never got married.

574
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,730
Peter可能是他爱过的最后一个男人
Peter could be the last man she ever loved.

575
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,630
没移情别恋的话 20年可是很长一段时间
20 years is a long time to go without loving someone else.

576
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,800
你爱上了Peter... 就会一直爱他
You fall in love with Peter, you... you are in love.

577
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,200
我很难想象这份感情会消失
I can't imagine those feelings ever going away.

578
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,500
至少不会完全消失
Not completely.

579
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,260
真的?
Really?

580
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,800
你说Peter Burke? 就是会议室那个男人?
Peter Burke? The man in the conference room?

581
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,560
你无从知道
You have no idea.

582
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,960
这很好
This is good.

583
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,200
我会让Jones和纽约警局合作
We'll have Jones coordinate with NYPD.

584
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,430
就能弄到这辆SUV现在的位置
We'll get a current location of the SUV.

585
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,060
追踪这辆车 就能知道它的实时位置
He can trail it and give us updates of its whereabouts.

586
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,500
不 Peter 我想我说得很清楚了
No. Peter. I think I was pretty clear.

587
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,360
不能让别人知道 谁都不能参与
No one else can know anything. No one else can be involved.

588
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,000
这是我的案子 就得按我的规矩办
It's my case, my rules.

589
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,300
这是我们的案子
It's our case.

590
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,760
是我让你入伙的
I brought you in on this.

591
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,200
别逼我把你撤出去
Don't make me take you off.

592
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,060
你把案子带给了精英调查小组
You brought it to White Collar,

593
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,500
而我是特别探员主管
and I'm ASAC here.

594
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,000
用我们的办法 否则你就别办这个案子了
We'll do it our way or you're out.

595
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,060
你是开玩笑吧
You're not serious.

596
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,760
难道我这表情看着像在开玩笑?
This face doesn't look serious to you?

597
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,460
好吧... 主管先生
Okay... ASAC.

598
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,830
Jones会追查这辆车 直接向我们报告
Jones keeps tabs, he reports back to us,

599
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,900
但我们不用告诉他原因
but we don't tell him why.

600
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,800
同意
Agreed.

601
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,060
这个
Yeah.

602
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,430
我要和El打个招呼
I'm gonna say hi to El.

603
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,960
好的
Yep.

604
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,730
你打电话给她了吗?
Did you call her?

605
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,200
打了 El态度还是很好
I did. El couldn't have been sweeter.

606
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,800
- 那还不错 对吧?  - 糟透了
- That's good, right?  - It's terrible.

607
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,800
她生我气的时候
When she's upset with me,

608
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,930
总会让自己很迷人 行程很满
she makes herself irresistible and unavailable.

609
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
- 这方法很好  - 快把我逼疯了
- Oh, nice technique.  - Drives me crazy.

610
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,400
好吧 赶快回家 当面谈谈
All right, go home, talk to her in person.

611
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,900
我不能
I can't.

612
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,830
Jill在安排交易
Jill's setting something up.

613
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,500
如果我跟El道歉到一半 跑去见Jill...
If I have to leave El mid-apology to meet Jill...

614
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,700
那就派别的探员去和Jill合作
So just assign a different agent to work with Jill.

615
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,460
这案子太重要了
This case is too important.

616
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,760
再说了 除我以外她不信任任何人
Besides, she doesn't trust anyone else.

617
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,030
好吧
Okay.

618
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,330
案子和Jill 到底哪个才是重点?
Is it about the case or is it about Jill?

619
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,730
我可以无所顾忌地跟Jill谈David的死
I can talk to Jill about losing David.

620
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
她自己也是过来的人了
She's been through it herself.

621
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,700
但El已经够提心吊胆的了 你不想再刺激她
And you don't wanna worry El any more than she already is.

622
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,000
没错
I don't.

623
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,430
这一年来她受得够多了
She's been through enough this year.

624
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,060
多到让她相信没有什么坏事是绝对不可能的
Enough to believe that other bad things are possible.

625
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,300
El知道我爱她
El knows that I'm in love with her.

626
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,360
- 她信任我  - 信任?
- She trusts me.  - Trust?

627
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,060
可你看 你反倒不信任她了
Now you see it, now you don't.

628
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,660
我得走了
I have to go.

629
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,430
那件不能提的案子?
Thing I can't talk about?

630
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,100
有眉目了
It's going down.

631
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,500
- 你必须跟踪他  - 听着 我绝不会去跟踪他
- You must follow him.  - Look, I am not following him.

632
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,930
我绝不会跟踪自己的丈夫
I'm not following my husband.

633
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,930
他从来没让我感到不信任他
He's never given me reason not to trust him.

634
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,630
- 到此为止  - Mozzie
- Until now.  - Mozzie.

635
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,930
你大可以信任
You can trust truffles

636
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,060
佩里戈尔地区产的块菌
harvested in the Perigord region,

637
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,260
马德拉的手织枕套
bed linens handwoven in Madeira,

638
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,000
甚至一只名叫莫扎特的泰迪熊
and, for the most part, a teddy bear named Mozart.

639
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,300
但人心? 几乎没有绝对的信任
But people? Almost never.

640
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,330
你就信任Neal
You trust Neal.

641
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,860
就是因为有Neal
Neal is the reason

642
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,930
"没有"前面才放了个"几乎"
"never" was preceded by "almost".

643
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,360
反正我不去跟踪Peter
I'm not following Peter.

644
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,500
- 你必须得去  - 就不
- You must.  - I won't.

645
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,960
- 必须的  - 不
- You must.  - No.

646
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,130
那就跟踪那个女人
Then follow the woman.

647
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,060
还是说你对猫咪探长海枯石烂的信任也转移到她身上了?
Or does your intrepid faith in the suit extend to her as well?

648
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,300
- 查出什么了?  - 诶 Peter
- What do you have?  - Yeah, Peter.

649
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,000
我跟着那辆SUV到了村庄
I followed the SUV to the village.

650
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,830
他们停下车就去了一家餐厅
They just parked and went into a restaurant.

651
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,400
谢了 Jones 他们走的时候告诉我
Thanks, Jones. Let me know when they leave.

652
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,930
没问题
Okay.

653
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,100
那些佣兵刚进了家餐厅
Mercenaries just went into a restaurant.

654
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,630
咱们做完交易之前 他们应该还没吃完
That meal should keep 'em on the shelf until we make the buy.

655
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,060
既然他们是冲着芯片来的
Well, they're after the chip.

656
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,000
怎么还有闲情逸致吃饭?
Why stop for a meal?

657
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,060
他们又不知道咱们现在进行交易
They don't know our buy's going down now.

658
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:39,030
就连坏人也是要吃饭的嘛
Even bad guys gotta eat.

659
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,860
你跟你老婆还好吧?
You and the missus okay?

660
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,300
我看她离开办公室的时候行色匆匆的
She left the office in kind of a hurry.

661
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,830
挺好的 她就是路过帮我带个三明治
Yeah, she was just dropping by a sandwich.

662
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,530
真幸福
Sweet.

663
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,700
我还得靠快递小哥养活着
I depend on the kindness of delivery guys.

664
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,430
你没结过婚?
You never got married?

665
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,060
有谁能容忍我的性子?
Who would put up with me?

666
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,500
- 喂?  - 喂 Peter
- Yeah?  - Yeah, Peter.

667
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,960
我感觉事情不太对
I've got a bad feeling about this.

668
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,330
我们后门没安排人
We don't have eyes on the rear.

669
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,460
申请许可进行盘查
Requesting permission for a walk-through.

670
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,600
他连简单盘查一下也不行吗?
Can't he just do a simple walk-through?

671
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,700
说好的不行
It's not part of the agreement.

672
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,930
你叫他等着
You tell him to stand by.

673
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,630
别去了
Don't go.

674
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,660
她不想让我去 你想
She doesn't want me to go. You do.

675
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,960
- 没错  - 明白
- Right.  - Gotcha.

676
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,460
- 我去看看  - 明白
- I'm going in.  - Got it.

677
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,600
本来是Mozzie帮我的 但...
Mozzie was supposed to help me, but...

678
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,030
拇囊炎移除
Bunion removal.

679
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,530
- 我都听说了  - 好
- I heard all about it.  - Okay.

680
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,230
我觉得她住这儿
This is where I think she's staying.

681
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,200
我想让你陪我去
I want you to come with me.

682
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,230
我听说她住在她的86款雪佛兰卡普里斯里
I hear she stays at the '86 Caprice.

683
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,530
我看到一张他俩站在这家旅馆前的照片
I saw a picture of them in front of this hotel.

684
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,100
站得很近 非常近
Close. Extremely close.

685
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,700
她一脸的甜蜜
And she looked smitten,

686
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,930
但他一副想回家的样子
but he looked like he wanted to go home.

687
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,260
因为他爱的是你
Because he's in love with you.

688
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,630
这我知道 但我想知道的是
I know that. What I don't know

689
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,130
她到底什么目的
is her intentions with him.

690
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,530
他不是一般人 但他还是个男人
I mean, he's not an ordinary man, but he is a man.

691
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,330
他们去那肯定是为了案子
If they are there, it's for the case

692
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,430
所以此行会很危险
and that could be dangerous.

693
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,360
所以我要你陪我
That's why I need you.

694
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,860
你要是不去 我就一个人去
If you don't go with me, I'm gonna go alone.

695
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,530
等等
Wait.

696
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,500
我开车送你 你火气太大了
I'll drive. You're too angry.

697
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,530
坐着无所事事 咱们走吧
I'm tired of sitting. Let's go.

698
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,600
还早呢
We're early.

699
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,830
抓他个措手不及
We'll catch him off guard.

700
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,460
也有可能露馅
Or tip him off.

701
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,400
Peter 我又不是菜鸟
I've done this before, Peter.

702
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,800
听着 他们都未必在这里
Look, they're probably not even here.

703
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,500
好吧 他们出现了
Okay, they're here.

704
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,160
不是你想的样子
That is not what it looked like.

705
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,060
最好不是
It better not be.

706
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,530
你知道吗...
You know...

707
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,260
我一度真的以为会看到他俩
I really thought I was gonna see both of them

708
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,600
坐在板凳上如胶似漆 动手动脚的
sitting on stools so close to each other they were touching.

709
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,460
Peter举着一杯啤酒
You know, Peter having a beer

710
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,400
Jill端着那种
and Jill having whatever women have

711
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,130
女人勾引别人老公时会喝的酒
when they're sitting with someone else's husband.

712
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,260
别太急着下结论
All right, don't jump to conclusions.

713
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,360
晚了 我已经下了
Too late. Already jumped.

714
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,360
在吧台等着 我跟前台
Wait at the bar. I'll pull a room number

715
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,130
把房间号套出来
out of the desk clerk.

716
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,960
如果... 有房间号这一说的话
If... there is a room number.

717
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,560
那几个佣兵不见了
Mercenaries are gone.

718
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,760
他们肯定认出我们了
They must have I.D.'d us

719
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,960
就从餐厅后面开溜了
and snuck out the back of the restaurant.

720
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,460
让特警待命
I want you to put the tac team on alert.

721
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,500
我给Peter打电话
I'm calling Peter.

722
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,900
SSG的规矩
SSG procedure.

723
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,830
手机静音
Radio silence.

724
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,830
好吧 从现在开始追踪Peter的手机
Okay, start tracking Peter's cell phone now.

725
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,960
他可能中计了
He might be walking into an ambush.

726
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,060
- 喂 Elizabeth  - 喂 Neal
- Elizabeth.  - Neal.

727
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,400
一个Peter档案里的男子就在吧台
A man from Peter's file is in the bar.

728
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,460
他们来这就是为了他 的确是个案子
That's why they're here. It was the case.

729
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,860
我跟你说不要急着下结论的
I told you not to jump.

730
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,860
Peter肯定在找他
I'm sure Peter's looking for him.

731
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,800
我觉得我能拖住他
I think I could stall him.

732
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,200
帮我联系到Peter 好吗?
Call Peter for me, okay?

733
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,760
Elizabeth 别轻举妄动...
Elizabeth, don't do anything...

734
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,200
- 嗨  - 嗨
- Hi.  - Hi.

735
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,530
呃 你住在这家宾馆吗?
Um, are you staying at the hotel?

736

No. Just getting a drink.

739
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,330
你有急事吗?
Are you in a rush?

740
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,030
什么?
What?

741
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,400

744
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,800
现在不行吗?
Why not now?

745
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,260
我要开个会
I have a meeting.

746
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,460
呃 你把手机给我
Um, how about you give me your phone

747
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,260
我把号码留给你
and I'll give you my number

748
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,930
你半小时后打给我如何?

749
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,400

755
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:27,060
Neal 就是他 你联系上Peter了吗?
Neal, that's him. Did you get a hold of Peter?

756
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,130
没有 转到语音信箱了
No. Voicemail.

757
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,360
在这等着
Wait here.

758
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,260
我看看他们去哪
I need to see where they're going.

759
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,160
不 我也来
Oh, no, I'm coming.

760
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,900
跟我说说刚才都发生了什么
All right, tell me everything that happened.

761
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,630
好 我跟他调情
Well, um, okay, I flirted with him.

762
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,560
他也试着回应 但明显疏于此道
He tried to flirt back, but he was not very good at it.

763
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,160
- 接着说  - 他好像急着要走
- Keep going.  - He seemed anxious to leave.

764
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,930
他说要不30分钟之后见
He said maybe meet up in 30 minutes

765
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,260
然后就在我手机里留下了他的号码
and he put his number in my phone.

766
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,330
他把号码输进了你的手机?
He put his number in your phone?

767
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,260
让我看看
Let me see it.

768
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,630
那是什么?
What is that?

769
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,730
一款新的微芯片吧
Some kind of new microchip.

770
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,730
Peter只跟我说是有关信息安全的
All Peter told me was that it's about security.

771
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,400
咱们似乎找到了他俩正在找的东西
I think we found what he and Jill are looking for.

772
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,500
他不应该在等咱们来的吗?
Shouldn't he be waiting for us?

773
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,400
如你所说 咱们来早了
Like you said, we're early.

774
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,500
他按兵不动
He's playing it cool.

775
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,660
老婆 我跟你说了 咱们走错房间了
Honey, I told you, it's the wrong room.

776
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,600
嘿 我那天看见你们俩了
Hey, I saw you the other day.

777
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,200
拍我们的... 照片
Taking pictures... of us.

778
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,200
我们是度蜜月的
We're honeymooners.

779
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,900
我们以为这是我们的房间 但钥匙打不开
We thought this was our room, but our key doesn't work,

780
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,060
所以看来不是了
So I guess it isn't.

781
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,530
这边尽头只有这一间房
There's only one room on this end.

782
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,830
哇 哇 哇
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

783
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,960
我们... 我们可不想惹麻烦
We don't... we don't want any trouble.

784
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,360
我们这就走 行吗?
We'll just be leaving, all right?

785
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,560
包里装的什么?
What's in the bag?

786
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,430
没什么
Nothing.

787
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,800
衣服
Clothes.

788
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,060
打开来
Open it.

789
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:00,560
打开 不然让你把蜜月度成寡妇月
Open it, or you go from honeymooner to widow.

790
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,900
钞票说明你们俩
Buyers or feds.

791
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,760
要么是买家 要么是探员
Cash says that you're either one or the other.

792
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,030
还有第三种
Third option.

793
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,230
我们不过是一对
We're newlyweds

794
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,730
不喜欢用信用卡的新婚夫妇
who don't believe in credit cards.

795
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,360
他是很传统的那种
He's an old-fashioned kind of guy.

796
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,430
没错
That I am.

797
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,100
我... 我不知道他是谁
I... I don't know who he is,

798
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,830
但她是个买家
but she's a buyer.

799
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,660
交易本应今天完成的
The deal was supposed to go down today.

800
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:24,930
就现在
Right now.

801
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
芯片呢!
The chip!

802
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,960
我藏在楼下一个女人那里了
I hid it on a woman downstairs.

803
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,060
什么女人?
What woman?

804
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,800
等等 我们都是买家
Wait. We're both buyers.

805
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,500
我代表伊朗那边
Iranian interests.

806
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,630
至少今早还是的
Well, at least I was until this morning.

807
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,860
朝鲜打来电话
North Korea came calling.

808
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,560
还没出停车库我们的合作关系就破裂了
Our partnership wasn't gonna make it past the parking garage.

809
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,860
妈的
Son of a bitch.

810
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,030
如果你们两位可以加入我们团队
Their country would be very grateful

811
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,160
朝鲜那边会非常感激
if the two of you joined our team.

812
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,860
感激不尽
Extremely grateful.

813
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,460
听着 杀了他们俩
Look, kill the both of them.

814
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,230
你们尽管把钱拿走
You can take the money.

815
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,960
我把我的那一半分给你们
I'll cut you in on my half of the chip.

816
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,560
给我松绑就好
Just untie me.

817
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,600
好吧 你去楼下
All right, you have to go downstairs.

818
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,600
我手里有芯片
I have the chip.

819
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,730
我要进去
I'm going in.

820
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,000
给我 我进去
Give it to me. I'll take it in.

821
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,130
你是准备帮我进去呢
Are you gonna help me get in there,

822
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,430
还是得我自己敲门?
or am I gonna have to knock?

823
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,660
咱们好好谈谈
Let's discuss this.

824
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,900
我不知道你们为谁工作
I don't know who you're working for

825
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,230
也不知道他们给你们待遇如何
or what they're paying you,

826
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,930
但朝鲜一定会待你们更加优厚
but the North Koreans will beat it.

827
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,630
得了吧 他们连自己人都还喂不饱
They can't even feed their own people.

828
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,430
闭嘴吧你
Shut up.

829
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,760
你到底在找什么呢 新郎官?
What are you looking for, newlywed?

830
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,400
好吧
All right.

831
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,200
- 你什么都没看到  - 那是什么?
- You never saw this.  - What is that?

832
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,060
是我和Mozzie研制的
It's something Mozzie and I made.

833
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,260
现在进去吧 假装这里是你的房间
Now go in there like you own the place.

834
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,660
把芯片给他们看 但别拿得太近
Show them the chip, but keep it away from them.

835
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,400
帮我争取30秒
Okay, try to buy me 30 seconds.

836
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,330
小心
Careful.

837
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,360
我问你话呢 新郎官
I asked you a question, newlywed.

838
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,660
你们要的东西在我这
I've got what you want.

839
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,300
亲爱的 快离开这
Hon, get out of here now.

840
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,430
就... 就是她
Th... that's her.

841
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,100
我就是把芯片藏在她这的
That's the woman I stashed the chip on.

842
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,060
没错
He's right.

843
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,360
就... 就在这里面
It's, uh... it's in here.

844
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,060
就... 就在我这
It's, um... I have it.

845
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,030
就... 就在...
It's, um... it's, uh...

846
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,060
就... 就在这里头 在手机外壳里
It's... It's right here. It's... It's in the phone case.

847
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,930
嘿!
Hey!

848
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,230
联邦调查局
FBI.

849
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,060
简直太绝了
Oh, that was incredible.

850
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:27,130
但不许你再这么做
But don't do anything like that again.

851
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,060
这我可没法打包票
I don't know if I can promise that.

852
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,700
这边抓到两个人
All right, we got two men down.

853
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,660
又是在精英调查小组稀松平常的一天
Another typical day at White Collar.

854
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,600
终于圆了我最惦念的梦想
Well, I fulfilled one of my fondest dreams.

855
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,360
- 哦 是什么?  - 与你共事
- Yeah, what's that?  - Working with you.

856
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,030
- 喔  - 很有趣
- Aw.  - It was fun.

857
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,960
在匡蒂科的时候咱们确实对此谈了不少
We did talk about that at Quantico a lot.

858
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,260
非常符合期望
It lived up to expectations.

859
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,160
可你那时有过更宏伟的梦想
But you had bigger dreams back then.

860
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,030
去华盛顿
Washington.

861
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,860
马上?
Soon?

862
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,200
一旦我把这里的琐事处理完
Once I've tied up all the loose ends here.

863
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,730
是啊
Yeah.

864
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,460
我不能随便找个人来监管Neal
I can't just bring anyone in to be Neal's handler.

865
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,300
我得确保那个人能够胜任
I gotta make sure they're up to the task.

866
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,530
- Peter  - 怎么?
- Peter.  - What?

867
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,800
琐事是永远没个头的
There'll always be loose ends.

868
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,530
也是啊
Yeah.

869
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,060
还有件事得请你帮忙解答
Yeah, and there's one you might be able to help me with.

870
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,600
是件很久以前的事
Uh, this one is a cold case

871
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,400
困扰了我20年了
that has been gnawing at me for 20 years.

872
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,260
为什么选加州?
Why California?

873
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,900
你是班里的尖子生
You were top in our class.

874
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,460
你其实想选哪里都可以的
You could have had any assignment you wanted.

875
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,360
我选了啊
I took an assignment.

876
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,060
西海岸首位女性特别督查组成员
First female SSG agent on the west coast.

877
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,300
- 我怎么拒绝得了?  - 我也不会拦你
- How could I turn that down?  - I wouldn't have stopped you.

878
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,400
你一直想来纽约
You wanted New York.

879
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,700
华盛顿特区 那是你的梦想
D.C. That was your dream.

880
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
你跑了
You ran.

881
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,060
你也没追过来啊
You didn't chase after me.

882
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,600
那样你只会跑得更快
You would have just run faster.

883
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,660
说得对 我的确会这样
You're right. I would have.

884
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,360
至少这样我们都能记住匡蒂科
At least this way we can remember Quantico

885
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,000
美好的一面
as the beautiful thing it was.

886
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,660
这样挺好
Let's do that.

887
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,860
你接下来去哪?
Where you headed?

888
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,130
去迈阿密 下一个案子
Off to Miami. Another case.

889
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,060
我希望再有个案子能让你再来纽约一趟
Well, I hope another case brings you to New York again.

890
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,530
或许到时候我能带着我的那位El过来
Yeah, maybe I'll bring my El with me.

891
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,600
- 男版的El  - 能找到便是万幸
- Male edition.  - Good luck finding one.

892
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,430
她的确是万里挑一
She's one in a million.

893
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,860
别害怕跟她坦白 Peter
Don't be afraid to talk to her, Peter.

894
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,130
任何事情都是
About anything.

895
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,100
我本应早些跟你说这些的
I should have talked to you about this a long time ago,

896
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,030
但我无法将他从我脑中挥去
but I can't stop thinking about him.

897
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,760
我无法摆脱的想法是 要是我没当上特别探员主管
I can't shake the feeling that if I hadn't become ASAC

898
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,600
他也不会死
he'd still be alive.

899
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,330
相信我 好吗?
Just trust me, okay?

900
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,200
- 我能睁眼吗?  - 不许
- Can I open my eyes?  - No, you can't.

901
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,900
下来... 有台阶
Step down... Curb. Curb. Curb.

902
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,360
好了
There you go.

903
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,900
台阶没那么高啦
It's not that big of a curb.

904
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,630
我不喜欢惊喜 一般没什么好事
I don't like surprises. They never turn out good.

905
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,530
好了 我们快到了
All right, we're almost there.

906
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,800
你知道吗
You know, you should know that

907
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,430
蒙着眼睛走在纽约的街头
walking the streets of New York blind

908
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,230
简直是梦魇重现啊
is a recurring nightmare of mine.

909
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,160
可以睁眼了
You can open your eyes.

910
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,830
是法典里画的那扇窗
It's the window from the codex.

911
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:19,830
你怎么找到的?
How did you ever find it?

912
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,460
Gruetzner探员动用了黑道上认识的人
Agent Gruetzner used some of his underworld contacts.

913
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:26,230
美极了
It's beautiful.

914
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,060
一点也不专业
Not professional.

915
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,360
的确
No.

916
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,260
一点也不
Not professional at all.
