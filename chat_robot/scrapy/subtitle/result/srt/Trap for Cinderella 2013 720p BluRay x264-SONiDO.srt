她在医院里病得很厉害
She's very ill in hospital.

414
00:48:12,167 --> 00:48:14,841
抱歉，但是她只剩几个星期的日子了
I'm sorry, but they give her no more than a few weeks.

415
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:18,508
她希望你马上去法国见她
She wants you to visit her in France right away.

416
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:20,502
你们两个都去 多，请准备好行囊
Both of you. Do, please pack a bag.

417
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:24,004
- 不，别听她的，多。          - 她一样想见到多
- No, don't listen to her, Do. - She wants to see Do too.

418
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:27,208
- 你不能把她差来差去。             - 准备好你的行囊
- You can't just order her around. - Pack your bag, please.

419
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:28,710
我不会去的。她恨我。
I'm not going. She hates me.

420

- 你这贱人！  - 米琪！
- You bitch!  - Micky!

421
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:34,547
米琪，住手！
Micky, stop it!

422
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:35,668
米琪
Micky!

423
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:44,302
我只是去了洗手间。
I'm just going to go to the bathroom.

424
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,343
我不相信
I don't believe you.

425
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:18,881
因为你在自欺欺人
Because your mind is blocking it out.

426
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,253
我不是多。
I'm not Do.

427
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,377
我一点都不像她
I don't feel like her.

428
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:27,210
多在事故中死了
Do died in the accident.

429
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:33,170
谢谢你邀请我
(Do) 'Thank you for inviting me.'

430
00:49:33,292 --> 00:49:37,251
那么...你想和我谈些什么
So... what do you want to talk to me about?

431
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:39,127
我想你需要振作起来
I thought you needed cheering up.

432
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:41,926
不用，我很好
No, I'm fine.

433
00:49:42,042 --> 00:49:44,295
什么，活在米琪的阴影之下
What, living under Micky's shadow?

434
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,468
- 好了，我不想说这些         - 抱歉
- Well, I wouldn't say that. - Sorry.

435
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:50,427
只是这使我想起了我是怎么到现在这种地步
I was just reminded of how it was for me.

436
00:49:50,542 --> 00:49:53,170
我不知道我怎么能够忍耐如此长的时间
I don't know how I put up with it for so long.

437
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:57,172
- 先是埃莉诺然后是米琪         - 你们俩合不来，是吗？
- First Elinor and then Micky. - You two don't get on, do you?

438
00:49:57,292 --> 00:50:01,718
不，米琪魅力非凡
No. Micky is irresistible.

439
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:05,883
但是她在自我放纵。 小心些不要最后被她所伤害
But she's destroying herself. Be careful you don't end up getting hurt.

440
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,422
我是她的朋友
I'm her friend.

441
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:09,260
她不会伤害我
So she won't hurt me.

442
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:12,800
也许你是对的 只是给你一点忠告
No, you're probably right. Just a little warning.

443
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,219
我看过你写给埃莉诺的信
I've read your letters to Elinor.

444
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:30,547
- 你看过我的信            -抱歉，这是我工作的一部分
- You've read my letters? - Sorry. It's part of my job.

445

-你怎么可以     - 多
- How dare you? - Do...

446
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,630
我知道你为什么把支票退回给埃莉诺
I know why you returned the cheque to Elinor.

447
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:40,128
你一定觉得羞耻
You mustn't feel ashamed.

448
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,548
我真的觉得这不是个好想法
I really don't think this was such a good idea.

449
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:45,511
我只是觉得这非常不公平
I just think it is so unfair.

450
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:49,632
为什么我们得不到我们人生应得的
Why do we not get the life we deserve?

451
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,424
她亲自找到我，当我还是18岁在她的一家
When I was 18, I was working in one of Elinor's factories

452
00:50:52,542 --> 00:50:54,044
工厂工作的时候
and she saw something in me.

453
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:56,885
她给了我一切
She offered me everything.

454
00:50:58,167 --> 00:51:00,545
接着米琪来了
Then along came Micky.

455

实际上你就和我一样
Deep down you're just like me.

456

你知道你应该得到一个更好的人生

你要带上你的游泳衣和护照

护照
Passport?

我想也许我们可以去法国南部
I thought maybe we could go to the south of France.

- Yeah, but I thought you... - Yeah, I changed my mind.

I just hate myself when I'm with her, the way she makes me act.

(Receptionist) Miss Law.

683
01:24:21,833 --> 01:24:23,005
有问题吗
Isn't it?

684
01:24:24,042 --> 01:24:26,215
你的名字叫米琪
(Dr Muller) 'Micky, that's your name.'

685
01:24:26,333 --> 01:24:28,381
晚上好，多
(Julia) 'Good evening, Do.'

686
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:31,552
我是谁
(Micky) 'Who am I?'

687
01:24:31,667 --> 01:24:33,465
多米尼卡... 米琪 ...多
(Julia) 'Domenica... Micky... Do.'

688
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:51,836
我们会找出来的
We've been found out.

689
01:24:51,958 --> 01:24:54,632
咖啡店那男孩说他全都听到了
The boy from the café, says he's heard it all.

690
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:56,844
- 他怎么做到的  - 我不知道
- How could he? - I don't know.

691
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,676
伊薇特看到他在附近
Yvette's seen him snooping around.

692
01:24:58,792 --> 01:25:00,590
你都告诉了他什么
What did you tell him?

693
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:03,757
- 我没有告诉他真相                   - 真相        
- Well, I didn't tell him the truth. - The truth?

694
01:25:05,208 --> 01:25:07,882
我没有告诉她你和多密谋要杀害米琪
I didn't tell him that you plotted with Do to kill Micky.

695
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,048
还好
Just as well.

696
01:25:10,167 --> 01:25:13,011
明天是米琪21岁生日
Tomorrow is Micky's 21st birthday.

697
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:18,006
我去伦敦和钱斯见面，最终我们会看到遗嘱
I'm meeting Chance in London and at last we'll read the will.

698
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,344
没有看到米琪真是遗憾
(Chance) I'm sorry not to have seen Micky.

699
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:35,302
她余下的事情都做得很好
The rest is doing her good.

700
01:25:35,417 --> 01:25:38,717
我非常惊讶你居然不是遗嘱的
I was surprised that you were not made an executor,

701
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:41,006
执行人或者是受益人
or a beneficiary, indeed.

702
01:25:41,125 --> 01:25:43,378
也许她为你准备好了其他条款
Perhaps she'd already made provision for you.

703
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:47,050
这一段时间可以做些适当的调整
There's been an arrangement in place for some time.

704
01:25:47,167 --> 01:25:48,510
一份不错的养老金
A modest pension.

705
01:25:48,625 --> 01:25:50,844
- 我没有告诉他真相               - 真相
- 'I didn't tell him the truth.' - 'The truth?'

706
01:25:50,958 --> 01:25:53,928
我没有告诉他你和多密谋杀害米琪
'I didn't tell him that you plotted with Do to kill Micky.'

707
01:25:54,042 --> 01:25:55,385
还
'Just...'

708
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:02,549
这部分和五年前起草时没有多大变化
There had been no change to the will drafted five years ago,

709
01:26:02,667 --> 01:26:07,924
只有这些 最后条款的内容 一定要等到米琪生日那天才能被宣读
just this, the last detail, to be opened on Micky's birthday.

710
01:26:08,042 --> 01:26:09,794
顺带祝米琪生日快乐
Happy birthday to Micky, by the way.

711
01:26:54,708 --> 01:26:56,756
- 我的钱在哪        - 你会拿到的
- Where's my money? - You'll get your money.

712
01:26:56,875 --> 01:26:58,343
我们去兜会风
Let's go for a drive.

713
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:18,049
如果你能闭紧你的嘴巴这些就是你的了
It's yours if you can keep your mouth shut.

714
01:27:18,958 --> 01:27:21,211
你说这值10万
You said it's worth 100,000.

715
01:27:21,792 --> 01:27:23,635
你可以把它卖了只要你想这么做
You could sell it if you want.

716
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:49,752
茱莉亚
Julia?

717
01:27:57,125 --> 01:27:59,127
茱莉亚
Julia?

718
01:28:04,958 --> 01:28:07,507
有人吗 茱莉亚
Hello? Julia?

719
01:28:09,958 --> 01:28:11,585
你在这吗
Are you there?

720
01:28:16,292 --> 01:28:17,509
茱莉亚
Julia?

721
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:22,877
有人在这吗
Is anyone here?

722
01:28:30,167 --> 01:28:32,169
有人吗
Hello?

723
01:28:49,917 --> 01:28:51,965
那老妇人最后的决定
The old lady had the last word.

724
01:28:57,625 --> 01:28:59,969
我根本没猜到
I would never have guessed.

725
01:29:00,083 --> 01:29:01,710
你这是什么意思
What do you mean?

726
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:03,551
她把一切都给了你
She left everything to you.

727
01:29:03,667 --> 01:29:06,341
- 给我   - 给你
- To me? - To you.

728
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:10,550
她把所有东西都给了多米尼卡·劳
She left everything to Domenica Law.

729
01:29:12,125 --> 01:29:14,753
所有的一切
All this for nothing.

730
01:29:15,792 --> 01:29:18,591
- 米琪死了  - 米琪知道这一切 茱莉亚
- And Micky dead. - Micky knew, Julia.

731
01:29:19,417 --> 01:29:21,260
不
No.

732
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:23,002
不 她什么都不知道
No, she knew nothing.

733
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:29,426
如果她知道你根本就不会在这，多
Do, you wouldn't be here if she'd known.

734
01:29:30,125 --> 01:29:31,172
她
She...

735
01:29:31,292 --> 01:29:33,511
她想要阻止你
She would have stopped you.

736
01:29:43,792 --> 01:29:45,385
你不可能
You can't...

737
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:50,049
- 你不可能是米琪      - 都结束了
- You can't be Micky! - It's over.
