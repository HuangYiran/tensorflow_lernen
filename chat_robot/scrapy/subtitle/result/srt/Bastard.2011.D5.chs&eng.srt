This door?
{\fscx60\fscy60}是这间吗？{\r}

This box or that box?
{\fscx60\fscy60}这个箱子还是那个啊？{\r}

00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,161
Are they all for me?

There is nothing, no name, no face
{\fscx60\fscy60}那儿什么都没有，没有名字，没有外貌{\r}

11
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,209
I was born into nothingness,
{\fscx60\fscy60}我被降临到虚无的世界{\r}

Dad, look.
{\fscx60\fscy60}爸，快看{\r}

22

Great.
{\fscx60\fscy60}很好{\r}

23
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,889
They are down there in the deep wateg
but I can't dive that deep.
{\fscx60\fscy60}它掉深水区了，我潜不到那么深{\r}

24
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,121
Dad, you are not looking.
{\fscx60\fscy60}爸，你根本都没看{\r}

25
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,605
Of course I am.
{\fscx60\fscy60}噢，知道了{\r}

{\fscx60\fscy60}- 能帮我吗？    - 好的，可以{\r}

27
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,289
Lotte, wait here in the shallow wateg

28
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,886
So, where are your goggles?

29
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,007
Down there.

No problem!
{\fscx60\fscy60}没关系！{\r}

33
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,601
Would you go on the slide with me.
I get scared on my own.
{\fscx60\fscy60}跟我一起去滑梯吧，我一个人不敢滑{\r}

34
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,209
No way.
{\fscx60\fscy60}不行{\r}

35
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,169
Or we could play 'animal jumping',
{\fscx60\fscy60}或者我们去玩“动物跳水”{\r}

36
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,847
I'll jump into the water and pretend to be an animal
and you have to guess what I am.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我学一种动物姿势跳水，你来猜是什么动物{\r}

37

I am here with my daughter.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我是带女儿来的{\r}

38
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,002
Your daughter sucks at doing the handstand.
{\fscx60\fscy60}你女儿玩的那个水中倒立姿势不对{\r}

39
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,614
She can't do it at all!
{\fscx60\fscy60}她做那么差劲{\r}

40
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,085
What are you talking about?
{\fscx60\fscy60}你在胡说些什么？{\r}

41
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,489
What the..., Hey, stop this bullshit!
Leave my daughter alone!
{\fscx60\fscy60}嘿！别做这样的傻事了！别来烦我的女儿！{\r}

42
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,129
Lotte, come on... let's get something to drink.
{\fscx60\fscy60}洛特，我们去喝点东西吧{\r}

43
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,003
Asshole!
{\fscx60\fscy60}混蛋{\r}

44
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,963
Mrs. Heine?
{\fscx60\fscy60}海纳女士？{\r}

{\fscx60\fscy60}尼库拉斯他不在{\r}

47
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,400
I know... but I borrowed him my knee guards,
{\fscx60\fscy60}我知道…可我把自己的护腿板借给他了{\r}

48
00:07:17,402 --> 00:07:19,721
and just wanted to ask, if I could get them back.
{\fscx60\fscy60}然后我想问问能不能拿回来{\r}

49
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,490
I need them for tomorrow's game.
Otherwise, I won't be allowed to play.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我明天比赛要用的，要不然就不能上场了{\r}

50
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,006
Come in,
{\fscx60\fscy60}进来吧{\r}

but please take off your shoes.
{\fscx60\fscy60}请把鞋脱了{\r}

{\fscx60\fscy60}您觉得尼库拉斯什么时候会回来？{\r}

That's very kind,
but I'am afraid ransom won't help.
{\fscx60\fscy60}谢谢好意，不过我觉得钱起不到作用{\r}

61
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,565
The knee guards,they must be in the cupboard, somewhere.
{\fscx60\fscy60}护腿板应该是在柜子里面{\r}

62
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,281
I didn't know that Nicolas is still
playing with dolls.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我之前还不知道尼库拉斯还在玩毛绒娃娃{\r}

63
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,288
Not Friedolin, the rabbit, please don't touch him!
{\fscx60\fscy60}别碰福利多林，这兔娃娃{\r}

{\fscx60\fscy60}我是不是该叫你麦纳特博士？{\r}

71
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,382
Meinert is fine.
{\fscx60\fscy60}叫我麦纳特就行{\r}

00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,167
Thank's for coming down so quickly.
{\fscx60\fscy60}很感谢能如此迅速赶来{\r}

73
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,270
I think we can save the compliments.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我觉得我们可以跳过这些恭维之词了{\r}

74
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,848
If I understood correctly, we are pushed for time.
{\fscx60\fscy60}要是我理解得没错的话，目前我们应该争分夺秒{\r}

75
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,228
Who was that?
{\fscx60\fscy60}刚才是谁？{\r}

76
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,823
Nobody.
{\fscx60\fscy60}没啥{\r}

77
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:40,462
The boy was last seen when leaving
school after his sixth lesson.
{\fscx60\fscy60}这男孩最后一次被目击是在他上完第六节课后放学回家{\r}

78
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,791
He never arrived at home.
We are still searching his way to school.
{\fscx60\fscy60}然后却再没出现，我们仍旧在他家与学校沿路搜查{\r}

79
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,426
Do you know what mouldy sandwiches,
like them ones mean?
{\fscx60\fscy60}您知道这些发霉的三明治意味着什么吗？{\r}

80
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,380
This syndrome is almost exclusively found in boys.
{\fscx60\fscy60}这种情况一般只在男孩子身上出现{\r}

81
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,104
They don't want to eat their sandwich,
but they are unable to throw it away.
{\fscx60\fscy60}他们不愿意吃给他们准备的三明治
但又不知道要把这东西从书包里扔掉{\r}

82
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,942
So the sandwiches start moulding...
just like a bad conscience.
{\fscx60\fscy60}所以这些三明治就会在书包里发霉，变质…
就好象坏情绪一样{\r}

83
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,664
Do you have kids, Mrs Meinert?
{\fscx60\fscy60}您有孩子吗，麦纳特女士？{\r}

84
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,384
I don't get along with kids.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我跟孩子处不好{\r}

85
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,441
Good afternoon ladies and gentleman,
may I see you tickets please?
{\fscx60\fscy60}下午好，女士们先生们，请大家出示一下车票{\r}

86
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,680
Are you also travelling without a ticket?
{\fscx60\fscy60}你也是逃票吗？{\r}

87
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,649
May I?
{\fscx60\fscy60}让我一下？{\r}

88
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,563
I don't mind if you need to piss,
unless you need to go for a shit,
{\fscx60\fscy60}你如果要小便，我不介意的，除非你想要上大号{\r}

89
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,081
that would be pretty uncool.
{\fscx60\fscy60}那就太扫兴了{\r}

90
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,651
Did that hurt?
{\fscx60\fscy60}穿这耳洞疼吗？{\r}

91
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,006
Are you pretending to be on an 'emo trip'?
Because I am talking too much, or what?
{\fscx60\fscy60}不想搭理我还是咋的？{\r}

92
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,762
You look propper gay.
But you have nice eyes.
{\fscx60\fscy60}你看起来更像是同性恋
不过眼睛很漂亮{\r}

93
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,086
I need to get out of here.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我得出去了{\r}

94
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,282
Cute.

Pussy.

96
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,202
What are you doing there?
{\fscx60\fscy60}你躺这儿干嘛？{\r}

97
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,087
Oh, I am sorry...
I was just thinking.
{\fscx60\fscy60}哦，我正在想……
很抱歉…{\r}

98
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,563
Don't worry I'll take care of that!
{\fscx60\fscy60}没事，我来弄这些！{\r}

99
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,846
Maybe you could help me.
I am looking for something personal from your son.
{\fscx60\fscy60}或许您能帮我一下，我想找一些您孩子的私人物品{\r}

100
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,169
Something that was important to him.
{\fscx60\fscy60}一些对于他来说很重要的物件{\r}

101
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,487
The football.
{\fscx60\fscy60}那个足球{\r}

102

Do you have something more personal.
{\fscx60\fscy60}有没有更私密一点的{\r}

{\fscx60\fscy60}这上面有全队球员签名的{\r}

104
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,449
What about this rabbit?

105
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,721
Lost
{\fscx60\fscy60}不见了{\r}

106

Please take off your shoes inside the house
{\fscx60\fscy60}下次进屋前请脱鞋{\r}

107
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,022
Mum?

108
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,522
Mum!
{\fscx60\fscy60}妈！{\r}

109

Get up! Come on, get up!

00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,936
We can't do anything, he knows that.
{\fscx60\fscy60}他知道我们做不了什么{\r}

335
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,580
We will claim charge against the father.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我们会起诉他父亲{\r}

336
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,690
Bring the boy home!
Clarify if the parents comply their fiduciary duty.
{\fscx60\fscy60}带这孩子回家！向他们父母阐明监护义务{\r}

337
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:45,094
We will be observing him, day and night.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我们会日夜监控他的{\r}

338
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:47,758
What the fuck.
{\fscx60\fscy60}他在干啥！{\r}

339
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,892
Our Hanne is pregnant.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我们的汉娜怀孕了{\r}

340
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,735
Give it back!
{\fscx60\fscy60}还给我！{\r}

341
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:57,054
Did you already know, our Hanne is pregnant?
{\fscx60\fscy60}你知道吗，这位汉娜怀孕了{\r}

342
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,859
That's enough!
{\fscx60\fscy60}闹够了！走吧{\r}

343
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,891
Do you already have name for the little one?
{\fscx60\fscy60}给小宝宝起好名字了没？{\r}

344
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,452
Or is it going to be a little girl,
a little Hanne?
{\fscx60\fscy60}或者是个小女孩呢……一个小汉娜？{\r}

345
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:30,339
Will you ride the crawler with me?
{\fscx60\fscy60}带我一起坐旋转飞爪吧？{\r}

346
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:35,540
Just one time... I get scared on my own.
{\fscx60\fscy60}就一次…我一个人不敢坐{\r}

347
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,417
I am here with my children.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我是带我孩子一起来的{\r}

348
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,254
Otherwise, I am going to tell my mother
that you touched me.
{\fscx60\fscy60}不然我就告诉我妈你摸我{\r}

349
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,093
I did what?
{\fscx60\fscy60}我啥？{\r}

350
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:46,776
You touched my tits.
{\fscx60\fscy60}你摸了我的胸{\r}

351
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,978
Are you nuts?
{\fscx60\fscy60}你神经病啊？{\r}

352
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,418
Just one round. One little bitty round.
{\fscx60\fscy60}就坐一轮，就那么一小会儿{\r}

353
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,579
Get off!
{\fscx60\fscy60}一边去！{\r}

354
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:12,812
Asshole.
{\fscx60\fscy60}混蛋{\r}

355
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:26,290
Sabine Meissner Seventy, four years of age,
she fell in her apartment,
{\fscx60\fscy60}萨比娜·麦斯纳，七十四岁，摔倒在自己的公寓{\r}

356
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:30,254
three weeks later the neighbours complained about the smell.
{\fscx60\fscy60}三周之后，邻居抱怨她屋子有异味传出{\r}

357
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:44,655
Blistering on the lips,
mucosal skin dried out and lacerated,
{\fscx60\fscy60}嘴唇起泡，粘膜层干裂{\r}

358
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:46,655
the tonsils inflamed.
{\fscx60\fscy60}扁桃体发炎{\r}

359
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
That's how somebody looks, who died of thirst.
{\fscx60\fscy60}那些被渴死的人看上去就是这副样子{\r}

360
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,337
I know it from the TV
{\fscx60\fscy60}我在电视上见过{\r}

361
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:04,074
Well then, touch hen
{\fscx60\fscy60}那行，你摸摸看{\r}

362
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:09,300
It's just a dead body.
{\fscx60\fscy60}尸体而已{\r}

363
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,939
Feels like a cold apple, and now?
{\fscx60\fscy60}感觉像是冰过的苹果，现在呢？{\r}

364
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:26,890
If Nicolas dies, he will feel the same.
{\fscx60\fscy60}要是尼库拉斯死了，摸起来的感觉也是一样{\r}

365
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:32,018
And you will feel guilty for your entire life,
because you were unable to save him.
{\fscx60\fscy60}然后你的余生都将会因为没能救出他而自责{\r}

366
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:10,096
His grades are good,
we have no problems with him.
{\fscx60\fscy60}他学习成绩很好，我们跟他也没什么问题{\r}

367
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:15,297
He is one of the best students in his year,
at least in written work.
{\fscx60\fscy60}他是他们班上最好的学生之一，至少从考试成绩来看{\r}

368
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:22,860
I think, you didn't really get my point.
Your son committed a serious crime.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我不知道你们有没有领会我的意思
你们的儿子现在涉及刑事犯罪{\r}

369
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:28,937
Are you sure,
I mean do you have any evidence?
{\fscx60\fscy60}您确定吗？我是说，您有证据吗？{\r}

370
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:32,179
He confessed.
{\fscx60\fscy60}他亲口承认了{\r}

371
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,939
Do you mind if I smoke?
{\fscx60\fscy60}不介意我抽烟吧？{\r}

372
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,819
Not in the house, Cora please!
{\fscx60\fscy60}请别在屋里抽烟，科拉！{\r}

373
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,853
Has your son changed at all recently?
{\fscx60\fscy60}你们有没有感觉到孩子近段时间有什么变化？{\r}

374
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,531
How were we supposed to?
He barely even speaks to us.
{\fscx60\fscy60}怎么感觉？他几乎不跟我们交流{\r}

375
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,614
That's a change, don't you think?
{\fscx60\fscy60}这就是一种变化，你不觉得吗？{\r}

376
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:12,939
We thought, it's the age.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我们还以为，青春期都这样{\r}

377
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:22,091
Your son no longer answers to his name.
I think that's not normal, don't you?
{\fscx60\fscy60}你们的孩子已经不愿意提及他的名字了
我觉得这有点不寻常，是不是？{\r}

378
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:26,012
Sammy, would you please hand me my coat?
{\fscx60\fscy60}萨米，能帮我把外套拿来吗？{\r}

379
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:43,053
I am sorry,could you please repeat your question?
{\fscx60\fscy60}不好意思，您能再重复一下刚才的问题吗？{\r}

380
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:47,061
If your son doesn't answer to his own name,
to what does he answer then?
{\fscx60\fscy60}要是您儿子不理睬自己的名字，那他会应什么？{\r}

381
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,896
Nothing. Just: Hey you.
{\fscx60\fscy60}没什么，就是：喂，你！{\r}

382
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:54,574
Do you remember any triggeg a fight maybe?
{\fscx60\fscy60}有什么矛盾起因吗？{\r}

383
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:00,371
He just stopped talking to us.
{\fscx60\fscy60}他就是那样停止跟我们交流了{\r}

384
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:03,375
It got worse last year
{\fscx60\fscy60}去年开始更糟糕了{\r}

385
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,699
He used to work things out by himself.
{\fscx60\fscy60}他总是自己解决自己的问题{\r}

386
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:07,614
As I said, it got worse last year.
{\fscx60\fscy60}就像我说的，去年开始变糟糕的{\r}

387
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,734
I can't force my child to talk to me.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我肯定也无法强迫孩子跟我交流{\r}

388
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,381
But you try it over and over again.
{\fscx60\fscy60}但你一直在不断地说{\r}

389
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:14,892
Yes, unlike you, I try to talk to my son,
that's right.
{\fscx60\fscy60}没错，反正不像你，我试图跟我儿子交流，那很正常{\r}

390
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:20,496
Do you still have physical contact with your son?
{\fscx60\fscy60}你们还有没有肢体语言上的交流？{\r}

391
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:24,490
Touching, hugs, cuddles...
{\fscx60\fscy60}安抚，拥抱，接近…{\r}

392
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:27,974
He is thirteen.
I don't get your question.
{\fscx60\fscy60}他已经十三岁了，我不明白您的意思{\r}

393
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,252
If I understand you right,
{\fscx60\fscy60}要是我理解的没错的话{\r}

394
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:34,091
your son has been socially completely isolated
for more than one year now.
{\fscx60\fscy60}您孩子已经至少有一年时间，从他的社会关系中脱离了{\r}

395
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:36,976
That's right you could say that.
{\fscx60\fscy60}没错，可以那么说{\r}

396
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:39,772
No, that's not right.
Only recently he completed an internship
{\fscx60\fscy60}不，不是那样的，最近他还去做了实习呢{\r}

397
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:42,740
a student internship in the youth well-fare office.
{\fscx60\fscy60}在青年福利局的学生实习{\r}

398
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:46,019
That's kind of social, isn't it.
{\fscx60\fscy60}那算是一种社交活动吧？{\r}

399
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:52,934
Does that mean it's all my fault?
{\fscx60\fscy60}难道现在都觉得是我的责任？{\r}

400
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:56,016
This isn't about fault.
{\fscx60\fscy60}现在不是谁的责任的问题{\r}

401
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:58,099
What then?
{\fscx60\fscy60}那要咋样？{\r}

402
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:03,256
I think, you are hiding something from me.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我感觉您有在隐瞒什么{\r}

403
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:27,260
Nicolas?
{\fscx60\fscy60}尼库拉斯？{\r}

404
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:35,535
What do you want from me?
{\fscx60\fscy60}你想要我做什么？{\r}

405
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:10,936
Will this be one of this: Show me your room
and I will tell you who you are thing?
{\fscx60\fscy60}现在你要说的是不是：
带我去看你的房间，然后我告诉你是谁{\r}

406
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,081
My self perception is disturbed.
{\fscx60\fscy60}你打搅到我自慰了{\r}

407
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:22,412
Would you please wait outside?
{\fscx60\fscy60}你能不能去外面等着？{\r}

408
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:08,000
Nietzsche said: We do not accuse nature of being
immoral if it sends us a thunderstorm.
{\fscx60\fscy60}尼采曾说过，即使大自然带给我们暴风雨
我们也不会去指责它的不道德{\r}

409
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:15,316
Why do we call a human being immoral if he kills.
No one is born evil.
{\fscx60\fscy60}要是有人杀了人，为何我们称之为邪恶？
没有人天生是邪恶的{\r}

410
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,999
So, it's society's fault or that of the parents?
{\fscx60\fscy60}那是社会的错，还是父母的错？{\r}

411
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,815
May I have one too?
{\fscx60\fscy60}能给我也来一支吗？{\r}

412
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,579
Nice lighten
{\fscx60\fscy60}打火机不错{\r}

413
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:41,293
I had it since I was twelve, pure brass,
you won't find this anymore today.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我十二岁的时候就得到它了，纯铜打造
现如今是找不到这样的货了{\r}

414
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:43,213
May I?
{\fscx60\fscy60}给我看看？{\r}

415
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:44,170
You're welcome!
{\fscx60\fscy60}给！{\r}

416
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:48,014
Did your father give it to you?
{\fscx60\fscy60}是你父亲送给你的？{\r}

417
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,856
No, I just found in somewhere,
and never lost it since.
{\fscx60\fscy60}不是，是我自己弄来的，然后就没丢弃过{\r}

418
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,459
Look at the lighter!
{\fscx60\fscy60}瞧这个打火机{\r}

419
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:01,410
I just want to answer your question.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我只想回答你的问题{\r}

420
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:08,877
Until now, I am nobody, just someone
that you have barely known for three days.
{\fscx60\fscy60}直到现在，我对于你来说
只不过是一个刚认识了三天的泛泛之辈{\r}

421
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:11,818
Look at the lighter!
{\fscx60\fscy60}你该看着这打火机的！{\r}

422
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:27,211
Now I am the one who broke your lighten
{\fscx60\fscy60}现在我则成为了弄坏你打火机的人{\r}

423
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:33,938
That has been my favourite lighter
for over forty years.
{\fscx60\fscy60}这是我最喜欢的打火机，跟了我四十年{\r}

424
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:38,491
The more it hurts you, the deeper our relationship.
{\fscx60\fscy60}伤得你越深，我们之间的关系也越深{\r}

425
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:41,736
You want to have a relationship with me,
and therefore you brake my lighter?
{\fscx60\fscy60}你想跟我建立关系，所以就弄坏了我的打火机？{\r}

426
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,076
If this is the only way to get in contact with you.
{\fscx60\fscy60}要是这是能跟你获得接触的唯一途径{\r}

427
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:49,460
Now you will never forget me.
{\fscx60\fscy60}现在你永远都不会忘记我了{\r}

428
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:51,573
No, this I'll never forget.
{\fscx60\fscy60}不，我永远不会忘记你的恶行{\r}

429
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:56,541
And that is his motive,
he want's a relationship with her at any cost.
{\fscx60\fscy60}这就是他的动机
他想不惜一切代价跟她建立起关系{\r}

430
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:00,077
If you would be a guy, I would smack you for that.
{\fscx60\fscy60}要是我再年轻几岁，我会因此而揍你的{\r}

431
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,820
I will buy you a new one.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我会给你再弄个新的来{\r}

432
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,700
I also know a Nietzsche saying...
{\fscx60\fscy60}我也知道尼采的一句话{\r}

433
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:11,172
The one who fights with monsters needs to be careful
{\fscx60\fscy60}跟恶魔战斗的时候，需要注意…{\r}

434
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:14,011
that he doesn't turn into a monster himself.
{\fscx60\fscy60}…不要让自己变成恶魔{\r}

435
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,254
Like I said, I'll get you an new one.
{\fscx60\fscy60}我说了，会给你弄个新的{\r}

436
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,571
May I ask you a personal question?
{\fscx60\fscy60}能问你一个私人问题吗？{\r}

437
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,659
Maybe another time.
{\fscx60\fscy60}还是下次吧{\r}

438
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:44,179
Fucking cold today.
{\fscx60\fscy60}今天真他妈冷啊{\r}

439

But then you found your adoption certificate.
{\fscx60\fscy60}可你发现了自己的领养证{\r}

604
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:37,892
By accident or did you search for it.
{\fscx60\fscy60}偶然的…还是你特意寻找的{\r}

Then he felt very bashful,
and tucked his head under his wing.
{\fscx60\fscy60}然后他开始难为情起来，把自己的头深埋到翅膀之下{\r}

persecuted and scorned,

616
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:33,016
and now he heard them all call him
the most beautiful of all beautiful birds.
{\fscx60\fscy60}而现在却听到大家都称赞他是所有美丽的鸟儿中最美的{\r}

617
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:37,818
The lilacs dipped their clusters
into the stream before him,
{\fscx60\fscy60}紫丁香在他面前也都弯腰把枝条伸到了水中{\r}

618
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:41,298
and the sun shone so warm and so heartening.
{\fscx60\fscy60}阳光是如此的温暖，如此的柔和{\r}

when I was the ugly duckling."
{\fscx60\fscy60}“当我还是一只丑小鸭的时候

{\fscx60\fscy60}你忘记晚安吻了{\r}

624
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:33,309
The boy was handed in by an unknown person
in the baby flap of the children's hospital Albert Sabin.
{\fscx60\fscy60}这孩子是被人匿名送交给阿尔伯特·萨宾儿童医院的{\r}

tomorrow not the day after
{\fscx60\fscy60}既然这样，那就是说，他的生日不是后天，而是明天{\r}

628
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:56,172
With Foundlings, the handover date is classified
as the official date of birth.
{\fscx60\fscy60}对于弃婴，往往会把他的接管日作为官方的出生日期{\r}

Is it possible to find out,
who the mother of the child is?
{\fscx60\fscy60}能想办法找出来谁是这孩子的母亲吗？{\r}

641
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:35,461

everything is anonymous.
{\fscx60\fscy60}从接收弃婴的过程来看，没有任何信息
