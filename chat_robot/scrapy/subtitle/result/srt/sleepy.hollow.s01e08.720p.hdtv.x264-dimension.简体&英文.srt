1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,950
《断头谷》前情提要
Previous on Sleepy Hollow.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,910
安迪  你不是死了吗
Andy? You're supposed to be dead.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,090
骑士不拿到他的头
The Horseman won't stop coming after you

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,760
是不会善罢甘休的
until he gets his head.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,780
我妹妹珍妮  她明天就要出院
My sister, Jenny. She's getting out of the institution tomorrow.

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,630
黑森佣兵  德国士兵对英国皇室非常忠诚
Hessians. German soldiers loyal to the British Crown.

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,470
跟四骑士一样
Like the Horseman.

8
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,400
你杀不死死神  但是你能困住他
You can't kill Death. But you can trap him.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,830
这是你打败他的唯一方法
It's the only way you can defeat him.

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,650
克兰
Crane?

11
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:21,950
就是现在
Now!

12
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,720
好了
Okay.

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,810
给你看样东西
I want to show you something.

14
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,740
来顶个拳
Fist bump.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,490
你说什么
I beg your pardon?

16
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,200
这是种表达...
It's an expression of...

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,200
喜悦的方式
elation.

18
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,000
意味着团队合作
Teamwork.

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,660
我们抓到他了
We got him.

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,900
顶拳是吧
Huh. Fist bump.

21
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,570
真无聊
Makes no sense.

22
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,950
难以置信
Hard to believe.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,670
简直是不可思议
Impossible.

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,460
但我们做到了
And yet, here we are.

25
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,570
我真想给北美防空联合司令部打个电话
I'm tempted to dial in NORAD.

26
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,750
让他们丢个核弹下来  结束这一切
Drop a nuke down here and call it a day.

27
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,370
恐怕他的生命力会跟小强一样顽强
I'm afraid it and the cockroaches will still be standing.

28
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,420
我们已经试过成千上万种方法想要置之死地
We've tried killing this thing a thousand ways to Sunday.

29
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,180
我一枪打中了他的胸膛
I put a bullet in his chest.

30
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,530
甚至砍掉了他的头颅
And cut off his head.

31
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,260
我们在这囚室里布满了克制他的东西
And we filled this cell with his personal Kryptonite.

32
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,820
这些被赋咒语的蜡烛是共济会提供的
Those hex candles from the Mason's supply.

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,780
紫外灯是市面上能买到的最强款式
The strongest UV lights on the open market.

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,620
-这能削弱他  但...  -他仍然死不了
- It's weakened him, but... - Here he stands before us.

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,570
跟两个多世纪前与我交手的那个人
As monstrous as the man I met on the battlefield

36
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,250
一样的可怕
more than two centuries ago.

37
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,070
如果我们消灭不了他  那怎么办
If we can't destroy him, what do you suggest?

38
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,270
让他烂在这么
Let him rot down here?

39
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,100
这个监狱很安全  托马斯・杰斐逊设计的
The cell is secure. Thomas Jefferson designed it.

40
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,050
而且被他妻子所在的女巫集会
Alongside his wife's witch coven,

41
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,280
施以了驱逐邪恶的咒语
who put a supernatural hex around it to keep the evil out.

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,620
我很难相信杰斐逊当时预见了
I can hardly believe Jefferson foresaw

43
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,340
这里要囚禁一个无头怪物
holding a headless man prisoner.

44
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,010
他预见的是遍及整个世界
He foresaw holding the worst

45
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,050
最凶恶的恶魔
type of demons that may walk the earth.

46
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,350
毫无疑问  是一种需要他历时多年
A product, no doubt, of his years

47
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,130
才能跟法国人解释明白的产物
trying to reason with the French.

48
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,550
无论无头骑士如何  其他怪物也将降临
No matter what happens with the Horseman, others are coming.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,340
女巫  恶魔  睡魔
Witches, demons, Sandmen.

50
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,970
长官  这听起来很疯狂
Sir, as crazy as this sounds,

51
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,520
但这场战争才刚刚打响
this war has just begun.

52
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,570
也许我们要像对其他战俘一样对他
Then perhaps we treat him as any other captured enemy.

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,180
他来断头谷是有原因的
He rode into Sleepy Hollow for a reason.

54
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,210
他知道计划着下一次进攻的邪恶势力是什么
He knows what evil is planning to attack next.

55
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,660
你想审问无头骑士吗
You want to interrogate the Horseman.

56
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,760
我可不觉得他会开口说话
I don't think he's gonna talk.

57
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,250
或者他能与死人交谈
Or maybe he'll talk to someone who's already dead.

58
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,820
这个当然
Of course.

59
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,900
你之前的朋友  布鲁克斯警官
Your former friend, Officer Brooks.

60
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,730
是已故的安迪・布鲁克斯警探吗
As in the late Detective Andy Brooks?

61
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,910
他之前为我们给无头骑士传过口信
He delivered a message to the Horseman for us before.

62
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,630
-他们一定能交流  -我记得他不是死了吗
- They must communicate. - Last I heard, he was dead.

63
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,740
事情不像你想的那样
Rules on that status have gotten a little bendy.

64
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,480
他不幸地被复活了
He's unhappily resurrected.

65
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,360
从而为摩洛克办事儿
Deployed as an agent for Moloch.

66
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,230
摩洛克  是书上说的万恶之首吗
Moloch, the demon on the top of the org chart?

67
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,160
但有个问题  我们怎能相信布鲁克斯呢
Which begs the question: how can we trust Brooks?

68
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,150
我相信他真的很后悔自己的行为
I believe he truly regrets his lot.

69
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,220
他已经帮助我们擒住了无头骑士
He's already aided us in capturing the Horseman.

70
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,850
而且他依然愿意为米尔斯小姐赴汤蹈火
And he still holds unrequited feelings for Ms. Mills.

71
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,810
-真的吗  -长官  我们能找到布鲁克斯
- Seriously? - Sir, we can track down Brooks.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,840
如果你能联系的上我妹妹
If you could get in touch with my sister, I think

73
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,110
我想她能派上用场的
she could be useful.

74
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,760
她不是刚出院吗
Didn't she just get out of Tarrytown Psychiatric?

75
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,920
昨天出的
Yesterday.

76
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,430
她有权知道
She deserves to know.

77
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,500
一个死人  一个精神病人
A dead guy, a mental patient...

78
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,160
还有一个从革命年代穿越来的
and a time traveler from the Revolution.

79
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,590
这就是我们的队伍
That's our team.

80
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,530
我貌似听到只鹿的动静
Thought I heard a deer.

81
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:06,930
你看到了吗
You see it?

82
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,610
还没
Not yet.

83
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,650
见鬼了吧...
What the hell?

84
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,750
同意
Agreed.

85
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,940
骑士遇到麻烦了

86
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,840
我们需要在此集结队伍

87
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,870
马上

88
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,360
你说的什么  德语吗
What is that, German?

89
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,050
我们最后一次见布鲁克斯是在前面那里
We last saw Brooks in this section up ahead.

90
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,610
这里一定是他的衣柜了
This must be his closet.

91
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,800
比我的大多了
It's bigger than mine,

92
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,000
不得不承认
I'll give him that.

93
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,920
看样子我们的亡灵线人
It appears our undead informant

94
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,870
去城里了
is out on the town.

95
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,150
安迪这个人做事喜欢按习惯来
Andy's a creature of habit.

96
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,420
如果他住在这里的话  那就肯定会回来的
If this is where he lives, this is where he'll come back.

97
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,580
珍妮弗・米尔斯
Jennifer Mills.

98
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,610
我是弗兰克・欧文警监
I'm Captain Frank Irving.

99
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,940
由我接手可以了
I'll take it from here.

100
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,070
警监
Captain.

101
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,780
请问一位无辜的美国人民坐在咖啡厅
I'm all for renditioning innocent Americans

102
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,830
一边喝着豆奶拿铁咖啡
while they're sitting at a cafe,

103
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,420
一边上着网
enjoying a soy latte

104
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,850
你就能因此逮捕人家吗
and some free Wi-Fi.

105
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,820
没有逮捕令  也没有律师在场
No warrant. No lawyer present.

106
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,040
谁让你不接电话
You weren't answering your phone.

107
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,330
是这样啊
Now you see why.

108
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,510
来我办公室
My office.

109
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,450
坐吧
Have a seat.

110
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,770
离开泰瑞顿精神疗养院的第一天
First day out of Tarrytown Psychiatric.

111
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,410
-感觉如何  -我有假释官
- How you doing? - I already have a P.O.

112
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,670
也有心理医生去报告
and a shrink that I report to,

113
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,100
所以不需要别人过问
so I don't need another shoulder.

114
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,130
-你姐姐让我找你的  -那她人呢
- Your sister asked me to find you. - And where's she?

115
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,150
-她有任务在身  -忙的都没时间接电话
- On assignment. - She can't even pick up her phone.

116
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,460
艾比真是没变啊
Typical Abbie, already...

117
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,710
你不喜欢政府权力机构  我懂
You don't like authority. I get it.

118
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,710
我知道你的过去  你说了实话
I know about your past. You told the truth

119
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,490
你跟他们说了你跟你姐姐小时候看到的东西
about what you and your sister saw as kids,

120
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,950
但政府权力机构让你失望了
and the system failed you.

121
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,490
这件事你都知道些什么
What do you know about any of this?

122
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,510
你真的知道她现在在什么地方吗
Do you even really know where she is right now?

123
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,330
艾比让我找你是因为她现在跟无头骑士在一起
Abbie asked me to track you down because she's with the Horseman.

124
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,860
天启四骑士之一
One of the Four Horsemen.

125
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,830
我们抓住他了
We captured him.

126
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,360
"我们"
"We"?

127
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,120
对你姐姐宽容一点吧
Cut your sister some slack.

128
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,790
你联系不到她是有原因的
She got a pretty good excuse for being out of touch.

129
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,280
我要见他
I want to see him.

130
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,360
他现在在共济会的一间牢房里
He's in a Masonic cell

131
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,830
那里应该足够坚固  可以困住他  但是
that's supposed to be strong enough to hold him, but...

132
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,700
这是我有生以来第一次见到这种东西
I've never seen anything like this in my life.

133
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,580
你以前帮过你姐姐
You helped your sister before.

134
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,740
艾比说这件事你能帮上忙  所以让我找你
Abbie wants me to bring you in to this, says you'll be valuable.

135
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,560
我也想相信她  但到目前为止
I'd like to believe her, but so far

136
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,720
你没有给我任何相信的理由
you haven't given me any confidence.

137
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,620
请进
Yeah, come in.

138
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,990
长官  亚当斯古玩店发生了点状况
Sir, there's a situation at Adams Antiquities.

139
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,370
公共设施问题
10-65 in progress.

140
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,810
报警公司打电话报警的
Alarm company called it in.

141
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,110
亚当斯
Adams?

142
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,650
你知道这个地方吗
You know the place?

143
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,380
我以前在店主手下工作过
Yeah, I used to do work for the owner.

144
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,570
自由收购
Freelance acquisitions.

145
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,510
收购什么
What kind of acquisitions?

146
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,080
好吧
Fine.

147
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,040
在这乖乖等我回来
Stay put till I get back.

148
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,130
等一下
Wait.

149
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,880
等等
Hey.

150
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,450
你想让我干什么
What do you want from me?

151
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,740
你看到这些人了吗
Do you see these people?

152
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,420
他们不懂
They don't understand.

153
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,390
我希望他们永远都不用懂
Hopefully they never will.

154
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,630
至少有我在时不用  但我也是新手
At least not on my watch. But I'm new to this,

155
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,850
而你在过去十二年的时间里
and you've spent the last 12 years of your life

156
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,160
都在考虑魔鬼出现的那一天
thinking about the day the demons will rise.

157
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,620
你可以自己去对付他  也可以帮我们一起对付
You can go it alone or you can help us.

158
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,230
但是我需要知道
But I need to know:

159
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,160
你是帮我们还是不帮
are you in or out?

160
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,150
帮
In.

161
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,940
那我们一起走吧
Then let's take a ride.

162
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,070
《变形记》
Metamorphosis.

163
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,940
挺适合布鲁克斯的
It's appropriate for Brooks.

164
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,760
你也该看看
You should check it out, too.

165
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,800
过去两百年里出现了很多好的
You know, there's been some pretty good American literature

166
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,830
-美国文学作品  -是啊
- in the last 200 years. - Yes,

167
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,660
我发现有吐温
I've discovered Twain,

168
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,240
福克纳  很厉害的南方人
Faulkner-- fascinating Southerner.

169
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,630
虽然我们应该谈论的是...
Though we should discuss...

170
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,890
书
books.

171
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,720
这是埃及象形文字
These are Egyptian hieroglyphs.

172
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,690
-放下  -安迪
- Put that down! - Andy.

173
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,200
艾比  你来这里干嘛  他怎么会来这里
Abbie. What are you doing here? What's he doing here?

174
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,990
我们一直都在找你
We've been looking for you.

175
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,120
希望你能帮我们
We're hoping you can help us.

176
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,970
我已经告诉你困住骑士的方法了
I already told you how to trap the Horseman.

177
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,700
你不是抓到他了吗
You have him, don't you?

178
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,620
但我们要知道他的弱点
We want to know his weakness.

179
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,430
我们要怎样才能打倒他
How do we break him?

180
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,780
打不倒
You don't.

181
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,460
你打不倒他
You don't break him.

182
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,530
别管他就是了
You leave him be.

183
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,880
唯一能和他沟通的办法
There is a way to communicate with him.

184
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,160
就是通过你
Through you.

185
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,330
这些是埃及人和死神沟通的标志
These are Egyptian symbols for communicating with the dead.

186
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,330
你是他的巫师
You're his necromancer.

187
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,800
巫师
Necromancer?

188
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,380
被指定的人拥有与死神对话的力量
An appointed one who has the power to speak for the dead.

189
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,590
你就是他的声音代言人吧
You're his voice, aren't you?

190
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,290
是的
I am.

191
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,800
那这就是你赎罪的机会
Then this is your chance at redemption.

192
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,570
和我们一起
Come with us,

193
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,660
让我们揭露他的秘密
allow us to unearth the man within.

194
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,870
你要带布鲁克斯回牢里吗
You want to bring Brooks to the cell?

195
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,450
是的  让他与骑士对话
Yes, to speak to the Horseman.

196
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,590
虽然有失败的风险  但我们不得不这么做
It's a calculated risk but one we must take

197
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,150
才能在这场战争中取得进展
to gain ground in this war.

198
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,160
我们会采取一切防范措施
We'll take every precaution.

199
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,860
艾比  请不要逼我
Abbie, please don't make me do this.

200
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,880
你说过你想帮我
You said you wanted to help me.

201
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:04,970
是的
I do.

202
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,380
但是你得明白
But you got to understand,

203
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,490
我在活着的时候  所作出的决定
the decisions I made when I was alive,

204
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,060
是不能反悔的
I can't take back.

205
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,130
我的灵魂再也不属于我自己
My soul doesn't belong to me anymore.

206
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,670
你的灵魂归我所有

207
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,010
当他来的时候
When he visits...

208
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,570
我毫无选择  只能服从他的命令
I have no choice but to obey his commands.

209
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,440
在我力所能及的时候
I help you

210
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,460
我会帮助你
when I can,

211
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,780
但是如果你把我和他关在一起
but if you put me in there with him,

212
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,170
结果会很糟糕
it is not gonna end well.

213
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,060
我怎么知道我现在能相信你
How do I know I can even trust you now?

214
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,920
你不能
You can't.

215
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,600
但是相信这句话
But believe this:

216
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,520
面对死神...
Confronting Death...

217
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,120
带来的只有痛苦
leads to nothing but misery.

218
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,830
这个黑暗将会永远萦绕着你
It's a darkness that'll haunt you forever.

219
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,630
好了
All right.

220
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,260
这边请
This way.

221
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,220
拜托了
Please.

222
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,940
错了  抱歉
No. Apologies.

223
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,870
应该是这边
It's this way.

224
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,750
手离远点
Hey. Hands in the open.

225
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,900
他们打破了珠宝盒
They broke the jewelry case

226
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,710
却没拿走这些价值连城的首饰
and left all the most expensive stuff.

227
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,500
这一切看起来像是
This all just seems...

228
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,430
幌子吗
Fake?

229
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,440
声东击西  但是为什么呢
A diversion, but why?

230
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,620
我要给你看些东西
I got to show you something.

231
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,070
通常亚当斯把他最贵重的物品藏在这里
Adams used to hide his most valuable merch in here.

232
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,520
-珍妮...  -亚当斯
- Jenny... - Adams!

233
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,470
他中枪了
He's shot!

234
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,570
这里需要个医务人员
Get a medic in here.

235
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,120
过来这边
Over here.

236
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,660
把第二个架子上的盒子拿过来
Second shelf. The box. Bring it over.

237
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,890
他们得手了吗
Did they get it?

238
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,130
盒子是空的
It's empty.

239
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,540
这是十六世纪督德鲁伊教徒的手稿
16th century Druidic scripture.

240
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,490
里面有什么
What was in it?

241
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,860
有色雷斯盘
Thracian Phiale.

242
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,310
一个古老的残遗物  据说在克伦威尔
A ancient relic, allegedly protected by warlocks

243
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,030
征服英国之后  此盘由术士保护
after Cromwell's conquest of Britain.

244
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,480
怎么会有人想要这种东西
Why would someone want something like that?

245
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,500
你不会想要
You wouldn't.

246
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,490
除非你想要打破降咒魔法
Not unless you wanted to break a Hax-Spell.

247
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,170
就像保护骑士牢房的那个咒语
Like the one protecting the Horseman's cell.

248
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,110
是谁干的
Who did this?

249
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,620
他们之间讲的是德语
They spoke German to each other.

250
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,700
是黑森佣兵
Hessians.

251
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,420
去吧
Go.

252
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,440
-去吧  -快点
- Go. - Come on.

253
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,910
如果黑森佣兵知道骑士的所在地
If the Hessians know where the Horseman is,

254
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,710
他们就能用这个盘子解除降咒
they can use the Phiale to remove the Hex.

255
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,910
我们把骑士照在紫外线灯下
We've got the Horseman weak

256
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,600
他们就会失去能力
under the U.V. lights.

257
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,370
除非他们把电力切断
Not if they cut the power.

258
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,160
他们下一步就要破坏电网
They're gonna take out the grid next.

259
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,530
我们要在去的路上打电话给艾比
We need to call Abbie on the way.

260
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,090
别说我没警告过你
Consider yourself warned.

261
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,390
你说过了
Considered.

262
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,330
主人  请听吾之召唤

263
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,690
赐吾汝之声

264
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,330
他好像没有聊天的兴致  你该感到庆幸
Must not be feeling too chatty. Consider it a blessing.

265
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,290
提不起精神吗
Feeling less than robust?

266
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,470
很好
Good.

267
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,270
你有名字吗
So, do you have a name?

268
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,880
还是我就这么叫你"死神"
Should I just call you Death?

269
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,300
或许你伺奉着摩洛克
You may serve Moloch...

270
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,560
或许在这牢房之外
and outside these walls you may be

271
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,040
你是《启示录》中的四骑士之一
one of the Four Horsemen from the Book of Revelation,

272
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,150
但如今...
but now...

273
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,180
你只是一个囚徒
you are nothing but a prisoner.

274
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,420
我会亲眼见证你与你同类的溃败
And I will see you and your kind defeated.

275
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,750
正如我亲手取了你的首级一样
Just as I took your head.

276
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,110
无论用什么方式
One way or other,

277
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,800
我都将得知你的秘密
I will learn your secrets,

278
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,370
而你将永世被困在这里
and you shall remain here for eternity...

279
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,020
...永远的失败者
...A failure.

280
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,130
这是从哪里来的
Where'd that come from?

281
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,250
克兰
Crane.

282
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,820
这是属于...
It belonged...

283
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,900
卡特里娜的
to Katrina.

284
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,720
是的
Yes,

285
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,850
你虽砍下了我的头颅
you took my head,

286
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,960
但死神不会因此而缄默
but death will not be silenced.

287
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,950
克兰  我知道你在想什么
Crane, I know what you're thinking.

288
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,780
你不会知道我在想些什么
You have no idea what I'm thinking.

289
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,120
听着  我是站在你这边的
Look, I'm on your side here.

290
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,220
布鲁克斯说过他会试图激怒我们
Brooks warned us that he would try to get under our skin.

291
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,790
但骑士为什么会有卡特里娜的项链
But how does the Horseman have Katrina's necklace?

292
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,030
好吧
Okay,

293
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,730
让我们从已知的信息着手
let's start with what we know.

294
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,820
为什么骑士会有这条项链
Why would he have this exact necklace?

295
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,190
这是送给她的一份礼物
It was a gift to her.

296
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,070
但不是我送的
But not from me.

297
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,620
这是她曾经的订婚对象送给她的
It was given to her by the man to whom she was once betrothed.

298
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,330
我的挚友
My best friend,

299
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,310
亚伯拉罕・范・布朗特
Abraham Van Brunt.

300
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,590
这条项链一定会虏获她的心  先生
This one, sir, is sure to melt her heart.

301
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,300
您在殖民地里再找不出一条这样的项链了
There's no other like it in the colonies.

302
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,040
我想这条项链一定会很适合她
I think I rather like it for her.

303
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,600
你觉得怎么样  伊卡伯德
What do you think, Ichabod?

304
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,060
是的  它...很漂亮
Yes, it's a... it's a beautiful piece.

305
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,190
这是最好的一条了
It's the best one.

306
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,320
这不是我该做的决定
It's not my place.

307
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,790
伊卡伯德  这很重要
Ichabod, this is important.

308
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,740
我...不确定这是否适合卡特里娜
I'm... I'm not sure it suits Katrina.

309
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,080
这条不错
This one.

310
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,010
能衬托出她的优雅
It embodies her elegance,

311
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,640
简单  美貌
simplicity, beauty...

312
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,540
和内敛
and restraint.

313
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,400
那好吧
Uh, very well.

314
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,590
我相信你的眼光
I'm trusting you.

315
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,760
转过身去  亲爱的
Turn around, darling.

316
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,760
喜欢吗
There... we... go.

317
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,440
太完美了
It's perfect.

318
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,820
这正是我喜欢的款式
Exactly what I would have chosen.

319
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,240
我就知道你一定会喜欢
I knew it would be.

320
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,440
拉特利奇来了
Ah, Rutledge is here,

321
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,060
他一定是带来了英国皇室的消息
with news from the Crown.

322
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,060
有传言说皇室正派部队前来消灭议会
Word is they're sending troops to disrupt Congress.

323
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,600
母亲
Mother.

324
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,880
恕我们失陪一阵
Excuse us.

325
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,370
项链是你挑的  不是吗
You picked this out, didn't you?

326
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,280
-你说什么  -亚伯拉罕的品味太浮夸
- Sorry? - Abraham's taste is far more excessive.

327
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,050
他绝不会送这样的东西给我
He's not bought anything of the kind for me.

328
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,300
或许他正在试着学习你的喜好
Perhaps he's learning.

329
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,670
我只是提供了一些建议
I merely consulted.

330
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,890
别太在意
Take no offense.

331
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,610
我要取消这个婚约
I'm breaking off the engagement.

332
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,680
你不能这样做
You can't.

333
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,290
我今晚就会告诉亚伯拉罕
I'm telling Abraham tonight.

334
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,430
卡特里娜...
Katrina...

335
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,070
我知道包办婚姻并不像童话故事般美好
I know an arranged marriage is not the stuff of fairy tales,

336
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,210
但亚伯拉罕来自一个良好的家庭  而且...
but Abraham's from a good family, and...

337
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,790
他爱你
he loves you.

338
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,160
但我不爱他
I do not love him.

339
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,640
我从未爱过他
I never have.

340
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,970
我的心另有所属
My heart belongs to another.

341
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,510
我不能背叛我的朋友
I cannot betray my friend.

342
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,780
这事不关乎你  亲爱的伊卡伯德
This isn't about you, dear Ichabod.

343
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,950
这关系着我的人生
This is my life.

344
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,150
我要取消这个婚约
I am breaking off the engagement

345
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,770
是因为我不想这样
because it isn't right for me.

346
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,180
-这么做会有后果的  -记得吗
- There are consequences. - As there were

347
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,390
在你背叛英格兰时不也正是如此
when you turned your back on England, remember?

348
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,020
这一切
All of this...

349
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,500
都是我们要努力留给后人的宝贵财富
it's the remnants of the life we are fighting to leave behind.

350
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,580
我可不希望自己努力建立的独立国家
I do not wish to go to the effort of creating

351
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,710
到头来还要被毫无意义的旧俗所桎梏
an independent country only to have it dictated by the same

352
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,270
正如我们祖国的传统
senseless customs as our motherland.

353
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,030
如果我要结婚
If and when I marry,

354
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,540
那一定是因为爱
it will be out of love.

355
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,610
否则  我都不知道自己在为何而战
Otherwise, I know not what I'm fighting for.

356
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,090
你完全有资格获得爱
You deserve nothing less than love.

357
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,960
我爱你  伊卡伯德
And I love you, Ichabod.

358
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,860
她甩了她的未婚夫  为了你
She dumped her fiance? For you.

359
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,720
你可真有几把刷子
Wow. You got some game.

360
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,880
我既没那个贼心也没那个贼胆
I neither wanted nor did I invite "Game."

361
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,080
这种不幸的情况
The unfortunate situation was a by-product

362
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,310
是当时女权极端贫乏的产物
of the meager rights afforded to women at the time.

363
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,860
但选了你还是好一些
It's still better to be you.

364
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,920
无论如何...
Be that as it may...

365
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,970
我得知道天启骑士是怎么拿到的
I need to understand why the Horseman has it.

366
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,430
是不是从她那里拿的
Did he take it from her?

367
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,810
他知不知道摩洛克为何要囚禁卡特里娜
Does he know why Moloch holds Katrina captive?

368
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,420
我们得关注重点
We need to stay on point.

369
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,700
我们在找他的弱点
We are looking for his weakness.

370
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,800
别让他发现你的弱点
Don't let him find yours.

371
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,370
那我们就来找找吧
And we shall find it.

372
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,580
让他开口
We have him talking.

373
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,280
断头谷电厂  西区电网

374
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,550
这就是为什么电厂工人都不配武器
That's why no electrical workers carry firearms.

375
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,530
在这儿等着
Wait here.

376
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,230
你开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

377
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,630
不许动
Don't move.

378
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,610
这么快就等得不耐烦了
So much for her waiting.

379
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,590
把枪放下  马上
Put 'em down! Now!

380
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,850
我们的人数比你多多了
You're way outnumbered.

381
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,310
换做我就会乖乖听她话
I'd do exactly as she said.

382
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,490
二对四吗
Two against four?

383
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,230
我觉得我们胜算更大
I like our odds.

384
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,020
再好好数数  阿道夫
Check your math, Adolf.

385
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,910
把手放在头上
Now, put your hands behind your head.

386
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:02,300
你怎么拿到这条项链的
How did you acquire this necklace?

387
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,230
你想戴上吗
You wish to wear it?

388
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,110
你怎么戴得上啊
How would that work, exactly?

389
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,950
你想念卡特里娜了
You miss Katrina.

390
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,580
关于她你知道些什么
What do you know about her?

391
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,570
我知道她所有的秘密
I know all of her secrets.

392
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,980
她的命运  她的定数
Her fate. Her destiny.

393
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,590
好  那跟我说说
Well, tell me.

394
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,970
你希望我知道的  不是吗
You want me to know, don't you?

395
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,190
还不到时候
Not yet.

396
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,330
但是你会知道的  在你死前
But you will learn... before you die.

397
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,470
我在战场上打败了你
I bested you in battle.

398
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,790
日光削弱了你的力量
The sunlight has weakened you.

399
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,010
你必须用一个傀儡来传话
You must use a puppet to speak.

400
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,660
而你现在像个笼中困兽
And now you are caged like a beast,

401
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,370
因为
because...

402
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,520
我取了你的项上人头
I took your head.

403
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,040
我打败了你们  在战场上打败了你们
I took you! I took you on the battlefield!

404
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,000
我杀了你的共济会弟兄
I slayed your Mason brethren!

405
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,810
把他们的脑袋当灯笼挂
I hung their heads like lanterns!

406
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,180
我杀了她的搭档
I killed her partner!

407
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,270
我也会杀了你
And I will kill you.

408
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,980
天呐  变成私人恩怨了
My, this has become very personal.

409
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,200
为什么是我
Why me?

410
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,990
你的任务是屠杀共济会  可你逗留在这里
Your mission was to massacre the Masons, yet you lingered.

411
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,290
为了你的头颅吗
For your head?

412
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,640
不
No.

413
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,540
为了我
For me.

414
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,620
对你来说那是巨大的打击
That was your downfall.

415
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,740
摩洛克批准这个任务了吗
Did Moloch sanction this mission?

416
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,060
还是说你自作主张
Are you on your own?

417
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,810
有些东西影响了你的判断力
Something blinded your judgment...

418
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,230
让你变得不够谨慎
made you careless.

419
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,370
我一直在等待这一天
I have waited for this day.

420
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,660
受到华盛顿嘉奖的士兵
Washington's prize soldier--

421
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:33,200
你在战场上搜寻我的同时
all the time you were searching for me on the battlefield...

422
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,650
我也在搜寻你
...I, too, was searching for you.

423
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,110
你就是我的任务
You were my mission.

424
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,170
无论过去还是现在
Then and now.

425
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,100
你问我为什么留在这里
You ask why I remain here.

426
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,790
是为了了结我的任务
To finish what I started.

427
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,140
当你垂死的时候
And as you lay dying,

428
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,740
想想紧随其后的鲜血与杀戮
think about all the bloodshed that will follow,

429
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,510
那都是你一手造成的
and know that it will be on your hands.

430
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,610
米尔斯  那辆货车是证物
Mills, that van is evidence.

431
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,580
你知道这有多危险吗
Do you know how dangerous this is?

432
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,710
我出动了一整支特种部队
I have an entire TAC team in position.

433
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,010
所以我才不担心
That's why I wasn't worried.

434
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,690
下次我再让你等着的时候
The next time I tell you to wait...

435
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,020
包是空的
This bag is empty.

436
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,440
袋子里装着的东西被转移到别处了
Whatever was in it is somewhere else out here now.

437
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:25,930
各单位注意
Attention,

438
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,930
我需要警犬在现场西南角立即展开搜索
I need the dogs rolling over the southwest quadrant immediately.

439
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,320
你为什么要在战场上找我
Why were you searching for me on the battlefield?

440
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,900
为你搭档的死报仇
To avenge the death of your partner.

441
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,550
我的搭档
My partner?

442
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,940
亚伯拉罕
Abraham.

443
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,940
难道你已经忘了他吗
Have you forgotten about him already?

444
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,520
克兰
Crane.

445
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,530
另一位见证者知道
Does the other Witness know

446
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,750
你背叛并杀害了自己以前的搭档吗
that you betrayed and killed your former partner?

447
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,330
不  一派胡言
No. That's lies.

448
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,640
这根本不是事实
That's not what happened!

449
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,840
克兰  听我说
Crane, listen to me.

450
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,880
我还没审完  女中尉
I'm not finished, Lieutenant.

451
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,420
警监
Captain.

452
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,420
我在现场周围发现了这个
Found this on the perimeter.

453
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,450
全体注意  断头谷水电部技术人员...
All teams, S&R on Hollow DWP...

454
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,840
紫外灯灭了
U.V. Lights.

455
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,200
我早说了不会顺利的
I told you this wasn't gonna end well.

456
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,370
所以警监相信还是这些
And the captain believes these same Hessians

457
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,900
黑森佣兵们偷了那个东西吗
are responsible for stealing this artifact?

458
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,270
我们只是不知道确切的人数
We just don't know how many of these guys there are.

459
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,420
他在水电部逮捕了六个人
He arrested six at the DWP.

460
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,210
说全称行吗
Uh, acronyms.

461
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,890
水务与电力部门
Department of Water & Power.

462
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,210
而且我们预计  距离重新恢复供电
And we're still guessing it's two hours

463
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,830
还有两小时
until they get the power back on.

464
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,100
两小时吗
Two hours?

465
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,700
他的力量每时每刻都在加强
Every minute he grows stronger.

466
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,490
他们会试着解救无头骑士的
They will attempt to release the Horseman.

467
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,100
我们已经准备好了  欧文正在来的路上
We'll be ready for them. Irving's on his way.

468
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,230
我要进去继续审问他
I'm going to resume our interrogation.

469
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,710
别急  我能看出来  他触动了你的神经
Not yet. Clearly, he struck a nerve in there.

470
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,650
我没有杀亚伯拉罕
I didn't kill Abraham.

471
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,180
我相信你  但我要了解他到底在说什么
I believe you, but I need to know what he's talking about.

472
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,580
想告诉我吗
Want to fill me in?

473
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,160
当卡特里娜打破婚约之后  亚伯拉罕伤心欲绝
Abraham was devastated when Katrina broke her troth to him.

474
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,680
第二天
The next day,

475
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,090
我们俩被委派去执行一项重要的秘密任务
the two of us were charged with an important clandestine mission,

476
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,110
去护送
to deliver

477
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:31,790
《第一届大陆会议决议宣言》
the Declaration of Resolves of the First Continental Congress.

478
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,360
《决议宣言》
Declaration of Resolves?

479
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,170
就是《独立宣言》的前身吗
Was that a precursor to the Declaration of Independence?

480
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,290
是的
Indeed.

481
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,270
它向国王描述了我们的怨愤和不满
It outlined our grievances to the king.

482
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,640
这是一项充满危险的重任
It was a crucial errand fraught with danger.

483
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,520
但是亚伯拉罕一直心不在焉
But Abraham's mind was elsewhere.

484
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,960
亚伯拉罕
Abraham.

485
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,520
小心一点  我们可是在敌占区
Be cautious-- we're in enemy territory.

486
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,220
她不想嫁给我
She doesn't want to marry me.

487
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:03,300
-真抱歉  -是我对她不好吗  克兰
- I'm sorry. - Did I mistreat her, Crane?

488
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,170
是我不够富有
Have I not enough wealth

489
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,460
没法给她的家人奢侈安逸的生活吗
to keep her family in comfort, even luxury?

490
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,580
没法给她显赫的社会地位吗
Social status she clearly has never had.

491
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,570
卡特里娜从不看重这些
Katrina's never cared for those things.

492
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,840
她充满生气  随心所欲
She's spirited. She's motivated by the heart.

493
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:15,990
随心所欲
The heart?

494
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,490
她没权利这么做
She has no right.

495
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,190
她这么做会让我怎么想
Do you realize how this will make me look?

496
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,470
是我配不上她吗
That I am not good enough for her?

497
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,120
我也是昨天才知道的  我发誓
I did not know until yesterday, I swear.

498
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,700
她向我...表达了自己的爱意
She professed her love... to me.

499
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,210
向你吗
To you?

500
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,960
强扭的瓜不甜
There's no need to force an unhappy union,

501
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,810
以你的身份和前景  有很多女人都愿意
not when there are many women who would faint

502
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,270
-投怀送抱...  -别一副...
- at your prospect... - Do not...

503
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,020
神气十足的样子
patronize me.

504
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,370
你追求她多久了
How long have you been wooing her?

505
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,910
亚伯拉罕  不  我绝不会拿我们的友情...
Abraham, no, I would not do our friendship the dishonor...

506
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,530
但你还是做了  你做了
But you have. You have!

507
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,570
亚伯拉罕...
Abraham...

508
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,340
你是我的朋友
you are my friend.

509
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,710
现在  请你理解  这对大家来说都不好受
Now, please, you must understand, this is hard for us all.

510
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,370
我们还想得到你的祝福
We wish for your blessing.

511
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,530
别想太多了
Do not burden yourself.

512
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,830
亚伯拉罕  不管你对我有多忿恨
Abraham, whatever your misgivings,

513
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,460
别在这时候发泄  别在这里
now is not the time, not here.

514
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,720
我们还有任务
Our mission.

515
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,840
满口胡言
Lies!

516
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,120
-拔出你的剑  -亚伯拉罕  我不跟你决斗
- Draw your sword. - Abraham, I will not duel.

517
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,420
你觉得我不配和你决斗吗  拔剑吧
You don't deem me worthy? Arm yourself!

518
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,570
-我认输  认输好吗  -我不接受
- I yield. I yield. - I do not accept.

519
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,530
现在是谁不配了
Who's unworthy now?

520
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,650
-亚伯拉罕  挺住  -走  快走
- Abraham, oh, no. - Leave, leave.

521
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,430
我们必须要平安护送《决议宣言》
We must deliver the Declaration.

522
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,090
快走
Leave me!

523
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,650
我不想伤害他的
I never meant to hurt him.

524
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,780
他的自尊
His pride

525
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,390
最终害了他自己
came at a great cost.

526
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,080
杀了他的是黑森雇佣兵  不是我
The Hessians killed him, not me.

527
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,240
布鲁克斯警告过我们
This is exactly what Brooks warned.

528
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,340
他知道你最黑暗的秘密
He knows your darkest secrets.

529
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,600
我也要发掘他的秘密
And I will learn his.

530
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,340
现在不行  他正在逐渐变强
Not yet. Not while he's getting stronger.

531
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,620
那我就更要...
That's all the more reason for me...

532
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,440
坐下来
For you to sit down.

533
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,920
我的审问有进展
I'm making progress.

534
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,070
现在我们知道了他为什么杀死了
Now we know why remained in Sleepy Hollow

535
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,340
共济会会员后还留在断头谷
after killing the Masons.

536
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,960
没错  为了杀你
Yes. To kill you.

537
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,000
只有知道他要杀我的原因才能找到他的弱点
And understanding why is key to learning his weakness.

538
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,930
克兰
Crane,

539
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,090
我们都知道该怎么审讯犯人
we both know how interrogations work.

540
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,730
对方若是揭了你的伤疤  就不该再继续
You don't face your adversary when you're raw

541
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,810
你就是这么失控的
that is how you lose control.

542
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,500
我没失控
I am in control!

543
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:53,040
艾比  克兰  我是欧文
Abbie? Crane? It's Irving.

544
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,470
我们尽快赶来了
We came as soon as we could.

545
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,490
我们
We?

546
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,900
我们查了所有黑森佣兵
We searched all the Hessians.

547
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,120
他们都没有色雷斯盘
None of them have the Thracian Phiale.

548
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,820
你把她也扯进来了
You brought her down?

549
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,930
我在帮警监的忙
I'm helping out the captain.

550
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,370
我说的是告诉她情况  不是带她来
I said tell her about it, not introduce them.

551
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,200
-你知道这是她出院第一天  -是吗
- You understand this is her first day out. - Do I?

552
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,820
如果他们都没有色雷斯盘
If none of them have the Thracian Phiale,

553
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,460
那它在哪里
where is it?

554
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,340
我们搜查了他们的家
We're searching their homes,

555
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,620
不动产  能想到的地方都搜遍了
properties, any connection we can think of.

556
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,960
目前仍一无所获
Nothing so far.

557
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,670
那玩意怎样才能生效
How does this thing work, exactly?

558
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,910
珍妮
Jenny.

559
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,170
对...
Right. Um...

560
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,890
他们得闯入牢房
they'd have to break into the cell

561
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,300
然后施展德鲁伊教的咒语
and perform a Druidic incantation.

562
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,460
就能解除巫法
That will lift the hex,

563
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,580
而所有的邪恶力量都会来到他身边
and all kinds of bad could get down here with him.

564
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,790
-我去叫后援  -别
- I'm calling for backup. - No.

565
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,930
她说得对  那可能就正好中了黑森佣兵的计
She's right. That may be exactly what the Hessians want.

566
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,670
已经有一个出卖灵魂的警察了
We already know of one dirty cop.

567
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,420
我们不知道能相信谁
We have no idea who we can trust

568
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,090
让外人进来会置我们于死地
Letting anyone into the tunnels with us could be the death of us.

569
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,710
恐怕她们说得对
I'm afraid they may be right.

570
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,230
这是一场秘密战争
This is a secret war.

571
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,390
挑选战友时要谨慎
We must be cautious whom we invite into it.

572
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,040
好吧
Fine.

573
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,230
我会在每个入口都布置一支特种兵队
I'll station an armed TAC team at every access point.

574
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,400
禁止任何人下来
Nobody's getting down here.

575
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,520
骑士出不去的  女中尉
The Horseman's not going anywhere, Lieutenant.

576
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,710
除非先杀了我
Not whilst I'm still alive.

577
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,180
好吧
All right,

578
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,650
如果只有我们守这里  那得需要重型火炮
if it's just us down here, we're gonna need heavier artillery.

579
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,510
我不会独留他一人在这
I'm not leaving the prisoner unmanned.

580
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,920
那你就留在这  坚守岗位
Then you can stay behind. Hold the fort.

581
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,640
你们两个帮我拿武器
But you two can help me carry the weapons.

582
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,650
长官
Sir...

583
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,810
没事的
It's all right.

584
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,230
还有巫法保护着牢房
The cell is still protected by the hex.

585
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,410
留你俩在一起我不放心  克兰
I don't like leaving you with him, Crane.

586
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,340
没有选择了
I see no alternative.

587
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,960
我不能留他单独在这里
I'm not leaving him alone.

588
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,210
我们走得越早
Sooner we leave,

589
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,350
回来得越早
sooner we're back.

590
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,840
我们待在隧道里  你俩去拿武器
We'll stay in the tunnels.You go to the precinct.

591
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,260
我会联系还驻守在电网的特种部队
I'll connect with the TAC team at the top of the grid.

592
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,550
一切顺利
Godspeed.

593
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,310
警监
Captain.

594
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,050
克兰  我留下来陪你
Crane, I'm staying back here with you.

595
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,180
不用了  女中尉
I'm fine, Lieutenant.

596
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,910
谢谢
Thank you.

597
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,550
别失了风度
Just don't lose your cool.

598
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,050
我永远不会
Oh. I shall never...

599
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,090
"失了风度"
"Lose my cool."

600
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,380
如果布鲁克斯攻击你的话
If Brooks gives you any flack,

601
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,070
把他的头也砍下来
take his head, too.

602
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,050
他好可怕
He is damn scary.

603
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:46,000
对  起码他现在还被锁着
Yeah. And you saw him locked up.

604
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:49,650
想象他骑在马上  拿着一把M4卡宾枪对着你
Imagine him on a horse, pointing an M4 at your ass.

605
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,760
他干过这事吗
He did that?

606
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,660
前几周不寻常的事我见多了
I've seen a lot of things in the last few weeks.

607
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,000
也许我们成功了
Well, maybe if we do this right,

608
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,510
那些东西就不会来了
those things'll stop coming.

609
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,170
色雷斯教徒...

610
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,380
我用魔盘

611
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,070
解除所有约束咒语

612
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,770
我召唤你们...

613
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,570
摩洛克奴仆请现身...

614
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,140
该死的那是什么
What the hell was that?

615
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,310
珍妮
Jenny!

616
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,400
这场秘密战争再次开始了
So, the secret war has begun anew.

617
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:20,340
你的任务是屠杀共济会会员
You were sent on a mission to kill the Masons.

618
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,310
你成功了
You succeeded.

619
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,030
但后来却忤逆了你的主人
But then you disobeyed your master

620
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,690
因为你有自己的任务
because you had your own mission.

621
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,900
是什么让你甘冒永囚地狱之险
What caused you to risk eternal imprisonment?

622
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,930
你与我有何未解的恩怨
What is your unfinished business with me?

623
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,220
现在  伊卡伯德
Now, Ichabod,

624
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,680
你马上就知道了
you shall learn.

625
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,080
布鲁克斯
Brooks.

626
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,420
不
No.

627
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,420
你搞了什么鬼
What have you done?

628
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,680
我别无选择
I had no choice!

629
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,570
根本不受我的意志所控
It wasn't my decision!

630
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,390
亚伯拉罕
Abraham.

631
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,730
这怎么可能
How can this be?

632
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,830
亚伯拉罕
Abraham?

633
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,290
这不可能
This is impossible.

634
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,000
你看着亚伯拉罕死去
You watched Abraham die.

635
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,340
那只不过是开始
That was only the beginning.

636
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,450
之后他来找我
Then he came to me.

637
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,400
你跟恶魔做了交易
You made a deal with the Devil.

638
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,070
他给了我一直想要的东西
He gave me what I always wanted.

639
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,430
复仇
Revenge.

640
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,770
我的战利品可不是复仇
My prize is not revenge.

641
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,160
是卡特里娜
It is Katrina.

642
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,550
卡特里娜
Katrina?

643
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,940
我想我知道自己被困在这里的原因
I believe I know why I am here.

644
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,390
她被囚禁...
She's held captive...

645
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,710
是因为你
for you.

646
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,190
她的灵魂...
Her soul...

647
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,620
会再一次属于我
will be mine once more.

648
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,870
不
No.

649
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,600
黑暗之影
进入房间

650
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,700
保护骑士

651
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,830
停  你不能杀他
Stop! You can't kill him!

652
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,450
主人不允许
The master forbids it!

653
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,960
告诉艾比我很抱歉
Tell Abbie I'm sorry.

654
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,180
导致亚伯拉罕成为天启骑士的并不是你
You didn't cause Abraham to become the Horseman.

655
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,770
不  是我
Yes, I did.

656
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,990
我亵渎了他的荣誉
I violated his honor.

657
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:34,140
这个太老套了
That is so 18th century.

658
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,810
人们会自己做决定
People make their own decisions.

659
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,940
你不必为他的行为负责
You are not responsible for his actions.

660
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,060
不用吗
No?

661
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,840
我对卡特里娜的爱蒙蔽了我
I was so blinded by my love for Katrina

662
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,770
我咎由自取
I created my own nemesis.

663
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:46,170
你这么说也太自大了
That is your arrogance talking.

664
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,020
怎么了
What?

665
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,470
我总觉得亚伯拉罕很自大
I always found Abraham arrogant.

666
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,870
但也许...
But perhaps...

667
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,510
他其实是我在镜中的倒影
he was just a mirror to myself.

668
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,430
说实话  我更喜欢烛光
Truth be told, I prefer candlelight.

669
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,670
它能营造一种氛围
It sets a certain mood.

670
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,230
布拉姆本可以杀了我以了心愿
Bram could've quenched his desire to kill me,

671
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,860
但布鲁克斯和摩洛克的奴仆阻止了他
but Brooks and Moloch's minions stopped him.

672
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,520
我无法解释摩洛克为何会帮我摆脱天启骑士
I can't explain why Moloch spared me from the Horseman.

673
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,140
或许  你只是不该死在他手上
Other than maybe you are not his to kill.

674
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,800
如果我不该由死亡骑士处置
If I'm not meant for the Horseman of Death,

675
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:32,930
那该由谁来
then who?

676
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,450
骑士说卡特里娜的灵魂将会是他的
The Horseman said that Katrina's soul will be his.

677
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,900
"将"这个字至关重要
"Will" being the crucial word.

678
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,290
所以也许
So perhaps...

679
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,140
也许等他和其他骑士一起重返马背
perhaps she's being held

680
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,110
她就能脱离囚禁了
until he rides with the other Horsemen.

681
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,080
从此末日便会开始
Thus beginning the end of days.

682
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,590
我们面对的是我们远不能控制的力量
We're dealing with forces so beyond our control.

683
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,780
远远不能
Beyond beyond.

684
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,170
可是...
And yet...

685
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,320
什么
Yes?

686
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,560
如果卡特里娜作为骑士的战利品被囚禁
If Katrina is being held for the Horseman as his prize

687
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,160
而亚伯拉罕想除你而后快
and Abraham was willing to go rogue and kill you,

688
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,110
所以出卖他的灵魂来...困住她...
sell his soul to... trap her...

689
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,370
那我们就找到了骑士的弱点
Then we've found the Horseman's weakness.

690
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,950
我妻子
My wife.

691
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,150
这就是关键  中尉
That's the key, Lieutenant.

692
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,950
现在  我们更加需要卡特里娜了
Now, more than ever... we need Katrina.
