3
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's happening now?

4
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, the zombie is eating her head, Grandma.

5
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not very nice. What's he doing that for?

6
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because he's a zombie. That's what they do.

7
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's going to ruin his dinner.

8
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure if they just bothered to sit down and talk it through,

9
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it would be a different story.

10
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman, didn't I tell you to take out the garbage?

11
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, coming, Dad.

12
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell him to turn up the thermostat, too, will you?

13
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My feet are like ice.

14
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, fit, you stupid...

15
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. What are you watching in there?

16
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sex and violence.

17
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, that's nice.

18
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't you be like other kids your age,

19
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and pitch a tent in the yard or have a healthy interest in carpentry?

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perry...

21
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you said kids my age were too busy shoplifting and joyriding.

22
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman.

23
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's, like, R-I-double-P-E-D. Like, a seven-pack at least.

24
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh-huh. Ew!

25
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch it!

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Courtney, be nice. Whoa!

27
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, she totally doesn't deserve him.

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, she's nice and I really like her,

29
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but she's a complete loser.

30
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I know.

31
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, uh, Dad?

32
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandma says, can you turn up the heating? Her feet are cold.

33
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, Perry...

34
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many times do we have to go through this, son?

35
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your grandmother is dead!

36
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

37
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then why do you keep on talking to her?

38
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because she talks back.

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OMG, you are such a liar.

40
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God, I'm not making this up, I swear! She talks to me all the time.

41
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah? Prove it.

42
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said, it's not very ladylike to hide photos of the high-school quarterback

43
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with his shirt off in your underwear drawer.

44
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew it!

45
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh! You've been sneaking around in my personal... Ugh!

46
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I haven't. Grandma told me.

47
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are the worst!

48
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman, I know you and Grandma were very close,

49
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but we all have to move on.

50
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grandma's in a better place now.

51
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, she's not. She's in the living room.

52
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your grandmother was old and sick and she died.

53
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's all there is to it!

54
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Perry, this is just part of the mourning process.

55
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, stop indulging him.

56
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm nothing if I'm not liberal,

57
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but that limp-wristed hippie garbage needs to be nipped in the bud.

58
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This behavior might be okay with your side of the family,

59
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I'm not putting up with it any more!

60
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not me!       - Not this again.

61
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This isn't the West Coast, Sandra.

62
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People talk. They do.

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's just sensitive, Perry.

64
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, please! Sensitive is writing poetry

65
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and being lousy at team sports. Not this.

66
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't have him turn out like that uncle of yours.

67
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If that crazy old tramp has been around here,

68
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}putting ideas in Norman's head...

69
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perry, no one has had anything to do with Uncle Prenderghast in years.

70
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I bet he doesn't even know what Norman looks like.

71
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not much time.

72
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not much time.

73
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,800


74
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning!

75
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Bruce, how's it going?

76
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not much. I'm kind of late for school, I need to go.

77
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi! Nice to see you guys.

78
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning. Sorry, I got to run. Oh!

79
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. Pardon me. See ya!

80
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey there, little buddy. Come on, come here.

81
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, good to see you.

82
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How you doing?

83
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi, Mrs. Hardman. You look nice today.

84
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like what you've done with your hair.

85
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does anyone smell burning?

86
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, peace, man.

87
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Totally. Yeah.

88
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As you were, soldier.

89
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, yes, sir!

90
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, Norman. You playing hooky?

91
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, I'm just late for school. Sorry, I got to go.

92
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How you doing?

93
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, how you doing?

94
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. How's it hanging?

95
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Haven't heard that one before.

96
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's a nice day.

97
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,890


98
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,490


99
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch and learn. "Parking violation" is my middle name.

100
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? I thought it was Rhona.

101
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,170


102
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,990


103
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,240


104
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,410


105
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,410


106
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey, ghost jerk, you know what?

107
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want, Alvin?

108
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you go see some more ghosts, Goober?

109
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey, Norman.

110
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Talk to that.

111
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's so Alvin! Right?

112
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was good, right, guys? That was fun?

113
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Flies don't talk.

114
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neil, come on, let's go.

115
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stink of illiteracy!

116
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pilgrims! The Mayflower!

117
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:32,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't any of you know anything about the history of this town?

118
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Puritans were strict and devout settlers,

119
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who came here to build a home,

120
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a place without sin!

121
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it now, Salma?

122
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is the witch always a hideous old crone

123
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with a pointy hat and a broomstick?

124
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe it's historically accurate, Miss Henscher.

125
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not supposed to be!

126
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's supposed to sell postcards and key chains.

127
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, let's try it again!

128
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Top of page six, Norman!

129
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"The founding fathers of Blithe Hollow

130
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}discovered an evil witch amongst them..."

131
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, Norman! With gusto!

132
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like this.

133
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"They put her on trial and hanged her!"

134
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:23,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"But the vengeful witch cursed her accusers, seven of them in all,

135
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to die a horrible and gruesome death,

136
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:34,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and rise from their graves as the living dead!"

137
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Their souls!"

138
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:43,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Their souls, doomed to an eternity of damnation!"

139
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I want you to try that again, but with conviction.

140
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My reputation is at stake, here.

141
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I won't have this turn out like that wretched Kabuki debacle of '09...

142
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman! Are you listening to me, boy?

143
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, Mrs. Henscher.

144
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So am I.

145
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, unless there's any other issues, let us resume.

146
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:26,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"They put her on trial and hanged her!"

147
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ooh! This is my moment!

148
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boom, baby!

149
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

150
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah! You useless bunch of...

151
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,420


152
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman, wait up!

153
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I keep telling you, Neil. I like to be alone.

154
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So do I! Let's do it together.

155
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You shouldn't let them get you down.

156
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They always do stuff like that to me.

157
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

158
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I'm fat. And my allergies make my eyes leak.

159
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I sweat when I walk too fast.

160
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I have a lunch box with a kitten on it.

161
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ooh. And I have irritable bowel syndrome.

162
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess there's a whole bunch of stuff.

163
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't it bother you?

164
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. You can't stop bullying. It's part of human nature.

165
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you were bigger and more stupid,

166
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you'd probably be a bully, too.

167
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's called "survival of the thickest."

168
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Psst!

169
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That statue just "psst" at us.

170
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know who I am?

171
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The weird, stinky old bum who lives up the hill?

172
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was asking him!

173
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, uh, I know.

174
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was told not to talk to you. Sorry.

175
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you know why you're not supposed to talk to me?

176
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can see ghosts, too!

177
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I know that's not all you've been seeing lately, is it?

178
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bad omens?

179
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Things you can't quite explain.

180
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Strange faces peering through the veil?

181
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I'll bet no one told you about the witch's curse, did they?

182
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, we're learning about it in school.

183
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, oh! I'm a tree!

184
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's something you really need to know.

185
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the most important thing you will ever hear.

186
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fate of everyone depends on it!

187
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, listen close.

188
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The witch's curse is real!

189
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're the one who has to stop it.

190
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got to use your gift

191
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}of talking to the dead.

192
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because, if you don't, the witch's...

193
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, oh. This is the most important thing of all!

194
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got to...

195
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got... You've...

196
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave him alone!

197
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't make me throw this hummus. It's spicy.

198
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This ain't done with!

199
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll see it soon enough.

200
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch for the sign.

201
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jeez, what a dirty old creep.

202
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's my uncle.

203
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, is it true?

204
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

205
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you see ghosts, like, everywhere, all the time?

206
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, yeah.

207
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Awesome!

208
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ooh, ooh! Do you think you could see my dog Bub?

209
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:04,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was ran over by an animal rescue van. Tragic and ironic.

210
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We buried him in the yard. Could you see him?

211
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Maybe.       - Sweet! Come on!

212
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neil? Is that you?

213
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Mitch. We're going to go play with the dead dog in the garden,

214
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we're not even going to have to dig him up first!

215
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're digging what? What? What did you say?

216
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neil, isn't he that weird kid?

217
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, "Look at me, I'm talking to ghosts

218
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so people will pay attention to me."

219
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you stop doing that? It's kind of stupid.

220
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, listen to me.

221
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't need to be hanging out with weird people. Okay?

222
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's atip.

223
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't blow this for me, Mitch. This one's not weird.

224
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He talks to dead people!

225
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's around here somewhere.

226
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,440


227
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, does everyone come back as a ghost?

228
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

229
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:57,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My grandma told me it's usually people who still have stuff to figure out,

230
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or sometimes it's the ones who died suddenly or in a bad way.

231
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bub?

232
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is he there? How does he look?

233
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, good. He's happy to see you.

234
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who's a good boy, huh? Good boy!

235
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can he feel if I pet him?

236
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I guess.

237
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, that's not his chin.

238
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go get it!

239
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He can't fetch it, you know.

240
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Well, it's still fun. Good boy!

241
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring it back!

242
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go get it, Bub. Good boy!

243
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you try?

244
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I don't really... You can go.

245
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No. It's fun, try it.

246
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I don't want to.

247
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You throw it. It's really easy.      - No, it's okay.

248
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You can throw it. I don't mind.       - No. Come on. It's really fun.

249
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, you go first.

250
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you try it. I already went, like, 50 times.

251
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, what do I do?

252
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get the stick, you pull back and you throw it.

253
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neil?

254
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry!

255
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I fetched it.

256
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?

257
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll show him, and that scary little fat kid.

258
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't he realize we're running out of...

259
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Not yet!

260
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not yet!

261
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aw, nuts.

262
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, I don't want to go! I want to go home! I don't want to go!

263
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. Now I'll never get to remember this moment.

264
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,860


265
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You suck.

266
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I curse you accusers to die a horrible and gruesome death,

267
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and rise from your graves as the living dead!

268
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your souls doomed to an eternity of damnation.

269
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill the witch! Kill the witch!

270
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill the witch!

271
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gosh, aren't they adorable?

272
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

273
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

274
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. Not again.

275
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This way. Over here.

276
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Witch! We know you're out there.

277
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There!     - No!

278
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Witch.

279
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The dead are coming!

280
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, buddy. Are you okay?

281
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The dead are coming!

282
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman!

283
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did he say the dead are coming?

284
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No, no, no, no.

285
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! The tree told me!

286
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is where it stops.

287
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's one thing being a mental case in front of your family,

288
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but not the whole freaking town!

289
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is not going to be any more talking to ghosts,

290
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or grandmas, or what is it now?

291
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's trees.

292
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are grounded.

293
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you hear me?

294
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is ridiculous. I wish everyone could see what I see.

295
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't ask to be born this way.

296
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Funny. Neither did we.

297
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, sometimes people say things that seem mean,

298
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but they do it because they're afraid.

299
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:36,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's my dad. He shouldn't be afraid of me.

300
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not afraid of you. He's afraid for you.

301
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look! It's AbNorman.

302
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did the tree tell you today, Norman?

303
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are the dead coming soon, Norman?

304
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You... You died?

305
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but I got unfinished business here.

306
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh. Couldn't you use another stall?

307
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My ghost isn't going anywhere,

308
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}until I pass on my duty to another.

309
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that would be you.

310
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me? No, no, no, no. You must have it wrong.

311
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ho hoo, it's you, all right.

312
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been holding back the witch's curse for years.

313
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:51,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now I'm dead. It has to be you.

314
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I... I don't know what any of it means.

315
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It means the past is coming back to haunt you!

316
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time is running out!

317
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The anniversary of the witch's death is tonight!

318
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her ghost is going to wake up.

319
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when she does, she'll raise the dead.

320
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got to keep her in her grave!

321
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm just a kid! How am I supposed to stop it?

322
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:33,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Read from the book at the spot the witch was buried.

323
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What book?

324
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The one in my hands.

325
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not these hands! My other hands.

326
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The "me" that's at home in my study

327
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}starting to smell a little funny.

328
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the book and read from it

329
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:55,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before the sun sets tonight.

330
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this is crazy.

331
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do I look crazy to you?

332
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me you'll do this.

333
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Swear!

334
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean like the "F" word?

335
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, promise!

336
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay. I... I promise.

337
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That will do.

338
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Mr. Prenderghast, wait!

339
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, kid, I'm done here. I'm free!

340
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm finally free!

341
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. No, you can't leave now!

342
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please! I don't understand!

343
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, you, uh... You might want to give that a few minutes.

344
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman?

345
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, what's the big deal?

346
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't get your bra in a twist, fat boy.

347
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This has nothing to do with you,

348
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so keep out of my way.

349
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or what?

350
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or I'll punch you in the boobs.

351
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have boobs. These are pectorals.

352
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ow, my boobs!

353
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're dead, freak show! Do you hear me?

354
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}D-E-D, dead!

355
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're going to be so dead,

356
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you're going to have to talk to yourself when you're dead!

357
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really don't think we should be leaving him.

358
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perry, you promised me a meal that someone else microwaved.

359
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:36,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's probably up there right now, fiddling with his Ouija, or his orbs,

360
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or whatever it is he's got up there! This is not good!

361
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,240


362
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,740


363
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want to play some hockey?

364
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:30,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I've kind of got other things on my mind right now.

365
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it all that walking dead stuff again?

366
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Prenderghast appeared to me in the bathroom.

367
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ew.

368
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! His spirit.

369
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He says the witch's curse is real,

370
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I have to go up to the old graveyard

371
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:48,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and stop it before the sun sets tonight.

372
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you want to come play a bit later?

373
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't you hear what I just said?

374
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but I thought my idea was the less likely to get us eaten.

375
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just go home, Neil. I'm better off on my own, anyway.

376
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But...     - Go home!

377
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:18,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jeez. Who rattled your chains?

378
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one.

379
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad says I'm not supposed to talk to you any more, Grandma.

380
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jackass.

381
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:41,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I were a poltergeist, I'd throw something at his head.

382
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, by rights,

383
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:50,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm supposed to be frolicking in paradise with your grandfather.

384
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm not.

385
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, why did you stay?

386
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was never one for frolicking.

387
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:02,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll bet there's no cable or canasta up there, either.

388
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:07,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides, I promised I'd always look out for you.

389
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, it's your duty.

390
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, in a manner of speaking.

391
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you would do it, no matter what?

392
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course!

393
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even if it was something really scary?

394
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:27,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing wrong with being scared, Norman,

395
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:32,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so long as you don't let it change who you are.

396
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I said to her, "Girl, come back and talk to me

397
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when your basket toss gets 12,000 hits on YouTube!"

398
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. No, I said that.

399
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I'm stuck on lame patrol.

400
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tonight's going to be a total yawn.

401
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman!

402
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You better not be sneaking out, you little weirdo!

403
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

404
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Prenderghast?

405
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, come on.

406
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Darn it.

407
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let go!

408
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

409
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,610


410
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is it.

411
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Read from the book, stop the curse,

412
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:25,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}go home, and pretend this never happened.

413
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,730

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hell, yeah. Hmm.

454
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I... Sorry to bug you so late.

455

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. He's my brother.

457
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, wow! That's great!

00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,680

00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Courtney.

460
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Neil! Come here a minute.

461
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a girl asking for you.

462
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, there!

463
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How are you doing, little guy?

464
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Neil?      - Yeah, Neil.

465
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know where Norman is? He kind of disappeared.

466
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. Idea!

467
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have no idea where he is. Sorry. Bye!

468
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, Neil.

469
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Better start talking, buddy.

470
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't really think he was serious about

471
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}going up to the old graveyard on his own.

472
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's so Norman!

473
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, man, that place is bad news.

474
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like a total slasher-movie vibe.

475
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did he go up there?

476
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Maybe we should go look for him.

477
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you he was trouble.

478
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, but I did.

479
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's fine. He sucks.

480
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I got to make sure he doesn't, you know, die or anything tonight.

481
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you help me?

482
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please?

483
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

484
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess I should go get some clothes on.

485
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, is Norman in trouble?

486
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are they going to try to eat our brains?

487
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you'll be safe.

488
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, thank God!

489
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't get it.

490
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why didn't it work?

491

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Story of Sleeping Beauty?

492
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This doesn't make any sense!

493
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! Where are you going?

494
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:49,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Prenderghast, I don't understand. Just tell me what to do!

495
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude, what are you doing?

496
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He told me to read from the book to stop the curse!

497
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought it was like a spell or something, but...

498
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. There has to be something.

499
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:03,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really need to get home

500
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because I've got a seriously early curfew.

501
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, seven victims.

502
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- My mom gets really upset...     - Seven victims.

503
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

504
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, got to defend ourselves.

505
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got to shoot them in the head with, like,

506
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}some sort of silver stake or something.

507
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seven victims.

508
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,040

00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman, are you listening to me?

510
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really got to do something!

511
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The witch's grave!

00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It wasn't there!

513
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was reading the book in the wrong place!

514
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hide!      - What?

515
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

516
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:10,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she said, "I could totally consider a career in formation swimming."

517
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:15,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I was like, "I want to do something that helps people less fortunate than me, thank you very much."

518
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know? Like, um... Like the poor.

519
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or people who are dying, or ugly or something.

520
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:25,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I really think that ecology and world peace

521
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are, like, totally important today.

522
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:30,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you use free weights? Because your deltoids are huge!

523
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never used deltoids in my life, I swear. You can test me.

524
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill me now.

525
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you for doing this, Mitch.

526
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He means an awful lot to me, you know?

527
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love him like he was a brother.

528
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is your brother.

529
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at that sky!

530
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look out!

531
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no!

532
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was Norman!

533
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:10,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is everyone okay?

534
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No.      - No.

535
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, hello, sir?

536
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:29,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is he dead or what?

537
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. He's not moving.

538
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:34,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's still breathing!

539
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, he's okay?

540
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not exactly.

541
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:44,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? What did you just say?

542
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does anyone know CPR or...

543
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run!

544
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you see that?

545
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was insane.

546
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:05,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know, right? I kicked that, like, a hundred yards!

547
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:07,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman, what just happened?

548
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Zombies! I swear, okay?

549
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We saw them burst out of their graves for real!

550
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:16,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just so you know, I totally saved his life,

551
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I could totally save yours.

552
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:20,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, who are you?

553
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:21,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Alvin.

554
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys? Maybe we should actually drive away now.

555
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, right.

556
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pesky kids with their cell phones, burning up the ozone.

557
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what this is.

558
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the...

559
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ugh! I just knew something like this was going to happen tonight.

560
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did? Wow. Because that zombie bit really threw me.

561
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you have to go and get everyone involved in all your weird stuff?

562
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you weren't supposed to follow me, were you?

563
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:31,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, my fault. When I'm nervous, I get mouth diarrhea.

564
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa! Diarrhea!

565
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:37,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my gosh! I think I'm having an aneurysm.

566
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, this is so typical of you!

567
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. You don't understand. I'm the only one who can stop this, Courtney!

568
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:43,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I understand.

569
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:47,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand that this is all getting completely out of... Hand!

570
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do we do? What do we do? Mitch!

571
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know! I don't know!

572
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the oldest.

573
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:58,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not mentally!

574
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, great, the cops.

575
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:05,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pull over the vehicle!

576
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman! How do we stop them?

577
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm supposed to read from the book at the witch's grave.

578
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got to go back to the graveyard?

579
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She wasn't buried with the others.

580
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:14,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know where else to look!

581
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:16,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you better think of something, quick!

582
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I have an idea!

583
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,570


584
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:23,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, Norman, let me get this straight.

585
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys all go on this big supernatural adventure,

586
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:28,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you're calling me in the middle of the night

587
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because you need someone to help you do your homework?

588
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:33,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, yeah.

589
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to find out where the witch is buried!

590
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no!

591
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I went to the old graveyard, but her grave wasn't there.

592
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:50,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, duh.

593
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:51,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People found guilty of witchcraft

594
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}weren't considered people any more.

595
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman, your witch was buried someplace else.

596
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In an unmarked grave.

597
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mitch, do something!

598
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you cared to pay attention some of the time,

599
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you would know that we covered this in fifth-grade history class.

600
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Salma! Please hurry!

601
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no!

602
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would Google this myself

603
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:32,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if there wasn't a 300-year-old dead guy trying to rip my face off.

604
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, okay.

605
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:38,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It says here she was tried in the old town hall on Main Street.

606
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There may be a record of her execution and burial in the archives.

607
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quick! She said, "Go to the town hall!"

608
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my goodness!

609
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really think it might help if you tried

610
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to see things from his point of view.

611
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:15,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to.

612
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perry, not believing in the afterlife

613
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is like not believing in astrology.

614
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have no idea what you're talking about.

615
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seriously. Where did you learn that?

616
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Calm down.

617
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:33,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Delinquent drivers! Where are the police when you need them?

618
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, my gosh.      - I broke a nail.

619
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:15,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to be sick.

620
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! Alvin the zombie slayer! I got you! Ow!

621
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Baby, I'm so sorry. You'll be all right.

622
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going to get through this together.

623
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:45,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

624
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:47,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah!

625
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:54,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perfect. Now the geeks are in charge.

626
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:40,040


627
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:53,840


628
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See? I told you! Zombies!

629
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the witch's curse!

630
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mama?

631
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:29,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

632
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:31,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What should we do?

633
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:39,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kill 'em in the head!

634
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

635
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:51,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hurry! This way!

636
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:56,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, this is awful!

637
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The zombies are, like, eating everyone!

638
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,600


639
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on!

640
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is everyone all right? Nobody got bitten?

641
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I bit my tongue. Does that count?

642
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does anyone know how to pick a lock?

643
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:32,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure. Picking locks is my thing.

644
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,080


645
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boom.

646
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:05,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is it!      - This is?

647
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000


648
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:08,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now we can find out where the witch was buried.

649
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. I'm super-psyched.

650
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is turning into the most fun night ever!

651
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man! Zombies take over the world

652
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we lock ourselves in a library!

653
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:26,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding me?

654
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's an adult video store just across the street.

655
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:32,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This will be a piece of cake, you'll see.

656
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Page one.

657
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, page one.

658
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really hate these places.

659
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:42,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

660
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not it. Time is running out.

661
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ain't room for no more zombies in this town!

662
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:53,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

663
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:26,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It would have been a quiet night, too,

664
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:29,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if it hadn't been for those meddling kids.

665
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweet baby jinkies!

666
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:37,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think you're doing, firing at civilians?

667
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is for the police to do!

668
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, no, no, it's okay, Sheriff.

669
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've only been shooting at the dead ones.

670
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the living dead, come to take us all to hell!

671
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:49,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got to stop them before they get away!

672
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,600


673
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:20,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move along now, people! There isn't anything to see here!

674
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw them! I saw them!

675
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're in the town hall!

676
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:36,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cry "Havoc," and let slip the dogs of war!

677
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's rip 'em apart!

678
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not going to find it in here, Norman.

679
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is useless!

680
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I know, and it's also really boring.

681
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought I was driving the van.

682
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:00,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one told me I was going to have to do this other dumb stuff.

683
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I had known there was so much reading involved,

684
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:06,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would have brought a completely different group of people who hate me.

685
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! Book number one, finished!

686
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:12,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is right. Twenty-six pages.

687
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah!

688
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't believe this is your plan.

689
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:25,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to get bitten and start eating people's brains.

690
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm supposed to be vegan!

691
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:29,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's something moving out there. I think it's the zombies.

692
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:30,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hide!

693
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, it's not. It's just grown-ups.

694
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:33,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hide!

695
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That sound. Do you know what that is?

696
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not awesome things.

697
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:44,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, come on!

698
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just give it up, you wiener.

699
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we have to keep trying.

700
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh! We tried, and look what happened.

701
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:54,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm scared, Norman, and I can't listen to this any more.

702
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never listen. No one ever listens!

703
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm scared, too, but I've still got to do this.

704
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do too listen!

705
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And whatever it was you just said, it's not working.

706
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think you're going to go out there, do your "talking to the dead" thing,

707
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and this is all going to be okay?

708
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:12,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you going to do? Huh? Ask the zombies not to eat you?

709
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:14,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I should have known you wouldn't understand.

710
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:16,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one ever does!

711
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman, you need to stop all this weird stuff,

712
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:21,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and start living in the real world.

713
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:23,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone in the real world thinks I'm a freak!

714
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you know what? Maybe they're right. Maybe I am a freak.

715
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I never asked for your help! Just go!

716
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out!

717
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jeez, that was dramatic.

718
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ugh! Come on!

719
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:47,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not going anywhere. You can't make me.

720
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dude, you're really heavy.

721
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:54,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not speaking to you. You can't make me.

00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:05,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um, excuse me! Hello?

723
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:15,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're in there, all right. I can feel its clammy flesh!

724
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

725
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:46,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help! Somebody, help me!

726
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:48,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's burn them out!

727
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:55,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're all going to die!

728
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my gosh.

729
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:22,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you think this has got anything to do with Norman?

730
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:24,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course not.

731
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone, look!

732
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perry, do something!

733
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman! Get down from there this instant!

734
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're supposed to be grounded!

735
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:38,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You horrible old witch! Is this what you want?

736
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Necromancer!

737
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:44,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is all his doing!

738
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:45,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman!

739
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:51,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Once upon a time, in a far-off land,

740
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:55,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there lived a king and a queen in a magnificent castle."

01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:59,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why won't you listen to me? Why are you doing this?

742
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:36,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Agatha Prenderghast of His Majesty's province of Massachusetts,

01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:43,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for the horrible crime of witchcraft

745
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:49,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}witnessed by those whose testimonies have been heard.

746
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:54,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have, by this court, been found guilty!

01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:55,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

748
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:58,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it is passed on you,

749
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}according to your grievous crimes,

750
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:03,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}execution!

751
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:11,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No!

752
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:17,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have anything to say for yourself?

753
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was only playing.

754
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:21,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye! With fire!

755
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were speaking with the dead!

756
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:29,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wait! No!      - I'll not risk damnation on these good people.

01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:32,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't do anything wrong!

759
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are to be taken to the place of execution

760
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}where you will be hanged by the neck

761
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:37,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}until you be dead.

762
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop!

763
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:41,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave me alone or I'll make you sorry!

764
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll make all of you sorry!

765
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:27,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could you?

766
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was just a little kid.

767
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:32,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She was no different than me.

768
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:36,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep away from me!

769
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:44,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must stop the curse.

770
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

771
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:49,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't want to kill me?

772
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can speak to the dead.

773
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To us.

774
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:59,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To her.

775
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:04,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need you to read from the book

776
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:08,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to send us all back to the grave.

777
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it didn't work!

778
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a fairytale!

779
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a bedtime story.

780
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:23,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it, isn't it?

781
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:27,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A bedtime story, to keep a little girl asleep for another year.

782
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:31,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now you need my help because

783
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:34,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the only one who can read it to her.

784
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here's your book!

785
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:39,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try reading it yourself.

786
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:44,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did you do it?

787
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:48,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were scared.

788
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:50,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of what?

789
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of her.

790
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:59,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believed we were doing what was right.

791
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:04,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was wrong.

792
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:08,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, this is our punishment.

793
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:12,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We thought we knew our way in life,

794
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but in death,

795
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:17,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we are lost.

796
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please help us.

797
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:27,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every year, someone reads the story at her grave.

798
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:30,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before me, it was Mr. Prenderghast,

799
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:34,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and before him, there were others,

800
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:37,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but the curse doesn't ever go away.

801
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:42,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing gets better. It's not enough.

802
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:45,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What will you do?

803
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:50,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something nobody ever did before.

804
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got to go talk to her.

805
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, guys! Under here, under here!

806
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mitch, Mitch, if we die tonight,

807
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}this may be the last chance I get to tell you how I feel.

808
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, well, no, unless we get brought back as zombies,

809
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:17,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then, technically, you'll have longer.

810
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:23,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman?

811
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:25,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! This way!

812
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:27,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got to be kidding me.

813
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:45,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stay right where you are!

814
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:49,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You may be dead already, but I will still shoot you!

815
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:51,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wait!      - Oh, my gosh.

816
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:56,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Son! Step away from the zombies!

817
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:57,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I won't.

818
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perry, calm down!

819
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:02,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're going to have a heart attack, and then what are you going to do?

820
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:04,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll come back and haunt Norman!

821
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe then he'll start listening to me.

822
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:09,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No, you don't understand what's happening here.

823
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:12,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I spoke to them, and it's not what you think.

824
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The curse isn't about the zombies hurting you,

825
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it's about you hurting them.

826
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I figured it out, and I know a way to stop this.

827
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's in league with them!

828
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:24,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's hang him!

829
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We can't hang him, stupid! It's the 21st century!

830
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then let's burn him!

831
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:31,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you stop being a mob for just one minute?

832
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:32,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to me!

833
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:35,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get them before they eat us!

834
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:40,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave him alone!

835
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hand, Alvin. My hand.

836
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:58,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody, listen up!

837
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:02,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You all need to stop trying to kill my brother!

838
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:03,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're adults!

839
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:05,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stop it!

840
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that this seems crazy.

841
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:10,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Believe me, lam with you on that.

842
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:14,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I think he does actually know what he's talking about.

843
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:18,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All night, he's been trying to save you from the witch's curse.

844
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:20,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! Yeah!

845
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:25,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And all you want to do is burn and murder stuff, burn and murder stuff.

846
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just burning and murdering.

847
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:30,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, shame on every single one of you!

848
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How dare you all?

849
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, they're not going to hurt us?

850
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:37,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

851
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does it look like any of them are trying to hurt you?

852
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're just people.

853
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:45,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, at least they used to be.

854
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:48,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just stupid people who should have known better.

855
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:53,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They did something unforgivable because they were scared,

856
01:08:53,790 --> 01:08:55,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they were cursed for it.

857
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:57,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now it's happening all over again.

858
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you get it? They were just like you.

859
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now it has to stop.

860
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For good.

861
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jeez, what is her problem?

862
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:55,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Norman!

863
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:59,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what do we do now?

864
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really don't know.

865
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, you do, Norman.

866
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:05,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got to get to that witch's grave.

867
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But...     - But nothing! Listen to me, buster.

868
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:11,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We didn't turn away when Daleridge High was slaughtering our volleyball team, did we?

869
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I thought we did.      - No, we didn't.

870
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:16,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have cheered the uncheerable, Norman,

871
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:18,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'm not letting you give up now!

872
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:22,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dad, could I borrow the car?

873
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:24,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me?

874
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:26,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Officials are urging people to panic and run...

875
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:47,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoo, boy. The traffic tonight, huh?

876
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:51,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman! Uh!

877
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:53,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's on my side of the seat.

878
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:55,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She wants you to move over.

879
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um, I heard that!

880
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:01,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, tell the zombie to stop saying stuff about me.

881
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:04,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you quit using the "Z" word?

882
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:06,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So help me, I will stop this car right now

883
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:09,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if all three of you don't quit it this instant!

884
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:19,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He says, take a left here.

885
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:22,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've already been this way! We're going around in circles!

886
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe we should pull over and ask someone.

887
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:27,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, right! You think maybe we should stop at a graveyard

888
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:30,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and dig up some other 18th-century corpses?

889
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not a bad idea.

890
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wish I understood you.

891
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:40,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please don't tell me he needs to use the bathroom.

892
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn down there!

893
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:50,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my. Do you think that's it?

894
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:58,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, why are we here?

895
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:02,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone has got to talk to her, Dad.

896
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:07,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Why is that person you, exactly?

897
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my goodness. Look out!

898
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:25,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom!

899
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:27,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perry! Do something!

900
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am trying!

901
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:30,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kick it in the knothole!

902
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman?

903
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:39,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm okay, Mom!

904
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:41,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just wait for me here. Don't worry.

905
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:43,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be careful!

906
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:21,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

907
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not welcome here.

908
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go away.

909
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:31,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really need to speak with you.

910
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who are you?

911
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:37,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Norman. Norman Babcock.

912
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:41,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't actually know me, but I know you.

913
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:44,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're actually kind of the same, you and I.

914
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:45,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not dead.

915
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, no, apart from that.

916
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:51,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're a boy.

917
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:53,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, yes. That, too.

918
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:56,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not like me at all!

919
01:13:57,330 --> 01:13:59,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I know how you feel.

920
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you don't. You don't know anything about me.

921
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:05,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know your name is Agatha Prenderghast.

922
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:06,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

923
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I know you're probably tired, right?

924
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:12,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because, I mean, it's really late,

925
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:15,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it's been a long night,

926
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:18,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we're, like, only 11 years old, and...

927
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:22,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to go to sleep, and you can't make me.

928
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:00,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I burned the book into dust.

929
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:04,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I don't have to listen to that stupid story any more!

930
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave me alone.

931
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:19,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, I'm not leaving.

932
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:21,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just listen to me.

933
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once upon a time,

934
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:27,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}long ago, there was a little girl.

935
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:28,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

936
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:31,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A little girl who was different...

937
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:34,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who was different from the other people in her village.

938
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not listening!

939
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She could see and do things that no one could understand,

940
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that made them scared of her.

941
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't like this story!

942
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She turned away from everyone, and became sad and lonely,

943
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:51,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and had no one to turn to!

944
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it!

945
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:11,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the more she turned away from people,

946
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:13,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the more scared they were of her,

947
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they did something terrible!

948
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:18,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They became so scared

949
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that they took her away and they killed her!

950
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:21,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

951
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:24,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But even though she was dead, something in her came back.

952
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:25,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop!

953
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:28,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this part of her, it wouldn't go away. Not for 300 years!

954
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:29,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shut up!

955
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:33,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the longer it stayed, the less there was of the little girl.

956
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:46,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll make you suffer!

957
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why?

958
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because... Because...

959
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:55,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because you want everyone to hurt just as much as you are.

960
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:58,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, whenever you wake up, you play this mean game,

961
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but you don't play fair!

962
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:06,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They hurt me.

963
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you hurt them back?

964
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:11,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanted everyone to see how rotten they were.

965
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're just like them, Agatha.

966
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm not!

967
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:17,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a bully!

968
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm not!

969
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They did something awful,

970
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but that doesn't mean you should, too.

971
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:53,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All that's left in you now is mean and horrible!

972
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not true!

973
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:57,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then stop! This is wrong and you know it!

974
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:59,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You spent so long remembering the bad people

975
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:01,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you've forgotten the good ones.

976
01:18:01,570 --> 01:18:05,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There must have been somebody who loved you and cared for you.

977
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't remember them?

978
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:07,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave me alone!

979
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you're not alone! You have to remember!

980
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:11,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep away from me!

981
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:12,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember!

982
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aggie.

983
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:42,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My name was Aggie.

984
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:51,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I remember,

985
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:54,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}my mommy brought me here once.

986
01:18:57,190 --> 01:19:01,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We sat under the tree and she told me stories.

987
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:04,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They all had happy endings.

988
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then those horrible men came and took me away,

989
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:10,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I never saw her again!

990
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes when people get scared,

991
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:23,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they say and do terrible things.

992
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:26,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you got so scared

993
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you forgot who you are.

994
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I don't think you're a witch. Not really.

995
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't?

996
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:41,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think you're just a little kid with a really special gift

997
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:44,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who only ever wanted people to understand her.

998
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, we're not all that different at all.

999
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:51,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what about the people who hurt you?

1000
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:54,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you ever want to make them suffer?

1001
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:59,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, yeah, but what good would that do?

1002
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:02,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think just because there's bad people out there,

1003
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:05,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that there's no good ones either?

1004
01:20:05,830 --> 01:20:08,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought the same thing for a while,

1005
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:11,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but there's always someone out there for you,

1006
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:14,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}somewhere.

1007
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want my mommy.

1008
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:25,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Aggie.

1009
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's gone.

1010
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:34,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That story you were telling, how does it end?

1011
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:38,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think that's up to you.

1012
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:50,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this where they buried me?

1013
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a pretty good place to sleep.

1014
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:58,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you can be with your mom again.

1015
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:24,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sleep tight.

1016
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:26,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman?

1017
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Norman!

1018
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:30,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My brave little man!

1019
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:34,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought I was going to lose you.

1020
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:36,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom! You're embarrassing me.

1021
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:38,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my job.

1022
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:40,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good job, Norman.

1023
01:22:40,850 --> 01:22:43,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well done, son. You did it.

1024
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:58,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, are we going to need statements?

1025
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:00,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Ow! That was my fingernail.

1026
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:04,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what it's like. You join a mob and you say things.

1027
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:07,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was merely inhabiting the role.

1028
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:10,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it was the others. They pushed me into it.

1029
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:13,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, me and Norman are in a lot of the same classes.

1030
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're pretty much inseparable best buds,

1031
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:18,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we do a lot of psychic investigations together.

1032
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a blog, actually. You should check it out.

1033
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:24,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, I was thinking maybe we could catch a movie sometime.

1034
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing scary.

1035
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That sounds great, Kathy.

1036
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:31,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, you're going to love my boyfriend.

1037
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:34,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's, like, a total chick-flick nut!

1038
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:43,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Neil.

1039
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:45,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did it! You stopped the witch's curse,

1040
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:49,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and made the zombies go away and saved pretty much everything!

1041
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:50,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess.

1042
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:52,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted to say thanks.

1043
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:55,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stood by me, all the time.

1044
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:58,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, of course! Don't get weird or anything.

1045
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:02,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, do you think now everything is going to turn back to normal?

1046
01:24:02,330 --> 01:24:05,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, as normal as it could be.

1047
01:24:07,170 --> 01:24:08,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it!

1048
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:09,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...whose lives have been ruined

1049
