仔细看看这张脸 巴尼 好吗
Take a good look at this face, Barney, okay?

27
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:56,233

00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,174
我要是真穿成李伯拉斯那样儿呢
What if I dressed up as Liberace?

137
00:04:08,176 --> 00:04:09,158
-成交  -成交
-Sold! -Sold.

138
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:12,545
然后 就没有然后了
And that was the end of it.

139
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:14,163
直到我的单身派对
Until my bachelor party.

140
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:15,348
啧啧
Uh-oh.

141
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,566
我猜猜看
Let me guess:

142
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:17,934
派对上肯定有个脱衣舞娘
there was a stripper.

143
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:20,169
你玩儿得挺美
You had a little fun.

144
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:22,806
备不住还禁不住怂恿 拍了几张少儿不宜的照片
Maybe took some ill-advised pictures.

145
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:23,890
然后紧接着
Next thing you know,

146
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:25,942
她就开始以此要挟勒索你 直到你几近破产
she's blackmailing you into bankruptcy,

147
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:27,360
你的医学学位就得挂在
and your medical degree's hanging on the wall

148
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:29,813
某真人激光枪游戏厅保安部的墙上
of a laser tag security office!

149
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:32,949
没有啊
No.

150
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:34,818
我单身派对那晚 我的哥们儿们把我带到了
The night of my bachelor party, my friends took me

151
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,152
一个屎到爆的破旅馆
to a crappy hotel,

152
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:37,988
把我前未婚妻请来当脱衣舞娘
hired my ex-fiancée to be the stripper,

153
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,856
我输了好几千块钱 而我最好的朋友
I lost thousands of dollars, and my best friend

154
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:40,857
连手都被人砍了
even had his hand cut off.

155
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:41,858
这本会是我人生中
It would've been

156
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,076
最糟糕的一个晚上
the worst night of all time

157
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:44,360
但这一切 都只是我
if the whole thing hadn't been

158
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:45,462
既有美丽又有魅力的未婚妻
a prank planned by

159
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:47,414
一手策划的充满惊喜的恶作剧
my beautiful, amazing fiancee.

160
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,833
她让我跌落地狱 就是为了让我
She put me through hell just to give me the best

161
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:52,218
拥有人生中最棒的惊喜 这里面还包括了
surprise of my life...which, p.S.,included an appearance

162
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,420
我最喜欢的演员的出场
by my favorite actor--

163
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:55,505
不属于A片范畴的
non-porn category.

164
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:57,707
哇 听起来挺酷的
Wow, that sounds pretty cool.

165
00:04:57,709 --> 00:04:59,576
可不是嘛 唯一不酷的就是
Yeah. Except pretty not cool,

166
00:04:59,578 --> 00:05:01,761
这个人嘴上一直说什么会再回敬我一个
because he kept talking about how he was gonna get me back,

167
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:04,097
然后 就在派对几天后 还真就...
and sure enough, a few days later...

168
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:06,733
罗宾 有些话我真的不知道该怎么跟你说
Robin, there's no good way to say this.

169
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:09,019
我犯了一个天大的错误
I've made a huge mistake.

170
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:10,820
这婚我没法结了
I can't go through with the wedding.

171
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:12,489
你说什么
What?

172
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:13,690
真的非常对不起
I'm so sorry.

173
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:15,492
只是 我...我必须在
I-I just... I had to tell you

174
00:05:15,494 --> 00:05:17,193
一切再也无可挽回之前告诉你
before it was too late.

175
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:19,496
天啊 你是认真的吗
Oh, my God, you're serious.

176
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:20,396
是
Yeah.

177
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:23,232
而且这里是我的公寓
And since this is my apartment,

178
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:25,168
所以 我觉得你应该搬出去了
I think that you should move out.

179
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:29,756
行啊
Fine.

180
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:34,410
狗狗
Puppies!

181
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,465
我知道 超棒的恶作剧 是不
I know. Great prank, right?

182
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:40,083
简直糟糕透顶
That is awful.

183
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:41,751
你丫绝壁是个怪胎
You're a frickin' weirdo.

184
00:05:41,753 --> 00:05:44,771
妥妥儿的怪胎
Such a weirdo.

185
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:46,139
小心点 别弄脏了袍子
Careful, watch the robe.

186
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:47,774
但是吧
Anyway,

187
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:49,776
因为某些只有你们和罗宾能理解
for reasons only you guys and Robin

188
00:05:49,778 --> 00:05:51,861
而像我这样的正常人所不能理解的原因
but nobody normal like me would understand,

189
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:53,262
罗宾变得超暴躁
she got cranky.

190
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:55,148
然后立下规矩
And she laid down the law.

191
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,566
不许再搞惊喜
No more surprises.

192
00:05:56,568 --> 00:05:58,318
但是你明明爱死惊喜了嘛
But you love surprises.

193
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,237
你爱惊喜就跟我爱舔自己一样
Almost as much as I love lickin' myself!

194
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:03,106
这话是我说的 不是狗狗说的
That was me talking, not the puppy.

195
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:04,457
巴尼 惊喜这东西很难收场的
Barney, the surprises are out of hand

196
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:05,408
不能再搞惊喜了
and they have to stop.

197
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,960
-行吗  -但是...
-Deal? -But...

198
00:06:06,962 --> 00:06:07,911
-行吗  -但是...
-Deal? -But...

199
00:06:07,913 --> 00:06:10,046
-行吗  -屁屁...
-Deal. -Butt...

200
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:10,780
巴尼
Barney...

201
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:13,133
好啦
Fine.

202
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:14,617
{\a6}deal还同时有小弟弟的意思

203
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:14,617
哦了
Deal.

204
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:16,469
老天
Man.

205
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:18,421
这个"不许再搞惊喜"的规矩
This whole "No more surprises" thing

206
00:06:18,423 --> 00:06:20,123
太不公平了
is so unfair.

207
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,141
谁会这么干啊
Who does that?

208
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:23,476
巴尼 "不再有惊喜"
Barney, the "No more surprises" thing

209
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:25,261
是婚姻中最好的部分
is the best part of being married.

210
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:26,796
真的 每天早晨我醒来的时候
It's true. When I wake up in the morning,

211
00:06:26,798 --> 00:06:29,298
我连莉莉的呼吸是什么味道的都能一清二楚
I know what Lily's breath is gonna smell like.

212
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,984
她的呼吸 就像玫瑰一样香甜
It's like... roses.

213
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:33,019
难道你真的希望在你和罗宾婚后的生活里
Do you really want a marriage

214
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:34,187
你每天都需要琢磨
where you have this paranoia

215
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:36,156
罗宾有没有偷偷摸摸的
that Robin's hiding around every corner,

216
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:38,608
搞些什么新恶作剧来回敬你吗
planning to get you back with some crazy new prank?

217
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,527
你说的一点错都没有
You're absolutely right.

218
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:41,528
谢谢你 莉莉
Thank you, Lily.

219
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,613
不对 那...是我说的 我在这儿呢
No, th... that was me, over here.

220
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:44,497
他根本没在听
He wasn't listening.

221
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:45,782
如果你们想告诉我的...
If you guys are saying

222
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:46,916
就是你们刚才说的
what I think you're saying...

223
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:48,118
非常有可能不是 你继续说
Probably not. Go on.

224
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,152
...那你们一定就是说...
...then that must mean...

225
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:50,153
不是 我们没那个意思
No, it doesn't.

226
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:52,455
...罗宾在为我策划一个
...that Robin is planning a surprise

227
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:54,841
真人激光枪惊喜预演晚宴
laser tag rehearsal dinner!

228
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,685
伙计 罗宾根本没有在策划
Dude, Robin is not planning

229
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,686
什么真人激光枪惊喜预演晚宴好嘛
a surprise laser tag rehearsal dinner.

230
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:02,637
不对 她有
Yes, she is.

231
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,438
-不 她没有  -不 她肯定有
-No, she isn't.  -Yes, she is.

232
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,073
不 我才没有
No, I'm not!

233
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:07,275
不 她有的
Yes, she is.

234
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:09,043
不 她没有
No, she isn't.

235
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:10,711
那她又是为什么
Then why did she pretend

236
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:12,813
装作在嘲笑这主意有多傻呢
to ridicule it as an idiotic idea?

237
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:15,983
因为这主意本来就傻透了
Because it is an idiotic idea.

238
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:17,785
如果罗宾真的
If Robin actually was

239
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:19,287
在策划什么惊喜
planning a surprise,

240
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:21,355
她至少会告诉她的首席伴娘吧
don't you think she would tell her maid of honor?

241
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,241
她没告诉你你因为你根本守不住秘密
She didn't tell you 'cause you can keep a secret

242
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,126
就像我的牙医总丢车钥匙
the way my dentist keeps his car keys.

243
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:29,863
你们不认识他啊 不过他确实总弄丢
You don't know him, but he's lost them...

244
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:30,965
两次呢
like, twice.

245
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:32,199
其实是 只有一次是丢的
Actually, just once, and...

246
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,302
另一次是放另一个口袋里了
that time they were in his other pocket.

247
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:36,104
我守不住秘密吗
I can't keep a secret?

248
00:07:36,106 --> 00:07:37,438
他说的有道理 莉莉
He does have a point, Lily.

249
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,140
你在大嘴跑风方面已经非常有名了
You're kind of famous for the old blabbity-blabbity.

250
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:40,275
嘿
Hey.

251
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:41,493
和黛比的午餐如何
How was lunch with Debbie?

252
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,111
好极 她怀孕了
Great. She's pregnant!

253
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:44,162
呜
Oops.

254
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,997
我不该告诉别人的
I'm not supposed to tell anybody. Why not?

255
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,665
因为她正在打离婚
Because she's getting a divorce.

256
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,816
妈蛋
Damn it!

257
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:49,984
黛比正闹离婚
Debbie's getting a divorce?

258
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:52,704
嗯 她把她老公捉奸在床了
Yeah, she walked in on her husband having sex.

259
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:53,922
搞毛啊 莉莉
Oh! Come on, Lily.

260
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:55,673
呃 也不用什么细节都说出来吧
Well, maybe we don't need to know every gory...

261
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,791
还是和一个男的
With a man.

262
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:59,627
你就不能闭嘴嘛 艾尔德林女士
Will you get it together, Aldrin?!

263
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:00,795
你没事吧 莉莉
You okay, Lily?

264
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:03,497
而那个男人正是搞大黛比肚子的
And that guy's the father of the baby.

265
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:03,497
{\a6}贵圈 真乱

266
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:05,767
我回去躺一会
I gotta go lie down.

267
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:08,887
于是就到今天早些时候
Which brings us to earlier today,

268
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,856
罗宾在布置假的预演晚宴时
when Robin was setting up the decoy rehearsal dinner,

269
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,775
连酒都是假的
complete with fake booze.

270
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,175
{\a6}预演晚宴前一小时

271
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:17,278
把这个当威士忌蒙混过去啊
Trying to pass this off as Scotch,

272
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,531
我们都知道这其实是苹果汁
and we all know it's apple juice.

273
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,022
喝苹果汁呛嗓子了
Typical apple juice burn.

274
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,159
没错 巴尼 这酒是真的
Yes, Barney, the booze is real.

275
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:32,460
吃的也是真的
The food is real.

276
00:08:32,462 --> 00:08:34,796
哦 说到吃的 无花果培根卷在哪儿呢
Ooh, speaking of which, where are the bacon-wrapped figs?

277
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:36,581
大概在
Probably at...

278
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,865
真人激光枪游戏厅了吧
...the laser tag place,

279
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:40,168
那儿不才是真正的预演晚宴举办的地方么
where the real rehearsal dinner's going down.

280
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,338
是不是这样 西奥多
Isn't that right, Theodore?

281
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,757
巴尼 没有什么真人激光枪
Barney, there is no laser tag.

282
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,008
咱们就在这儿好好吃顿饭
We're gonna have a nice dinner,

283
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,426
喝点酒 然后
some drinks, and then,

284
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,427
按照罗宾说的
according to Robin,

285
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,979
如果她的伊迪斯姑妈喝得够醉
if her Aunt Edith gets drunk enough,

286
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:52,713
她就会把假发摘下来 然后他们就能拿它打冰球了
she'll take off her wig and they'll play hockey with it.

287
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:53,815
胡说八道
Poppycock!

288
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,900
你知道她会怎么做的
You know how she's gonna do it,

289
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:56,985
你也会如实告诉我的
and you're gonna tell me!

290
00:08:56,987 --> 00:09:00,188
还是我要把脸凑得更近点
Or do I have to get my face

291
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,557
你才会告诉我
even closer to yours?

292
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,558
嘿
Hey.

293
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,827
你为什么不把脸
How come you're not getting

294
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:07,395
跟我的脸贴近点呢
uncomfortably close to my face?

295
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:09,897
我也有可能知道内情啊
I could be in on it, too.

296
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:12,733
可不嘛 莉莉
'Course you could, Lil.

297
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:14,369
我能保守秘密的
I can keep a secret.

298
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:15,787
莉莉哟 快别逗我了
Lily, don't make me laugh.

299
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,171
我要是信你能保守秘密
I'd trust you with a secret

300
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:19,090
就跟我信马修会抖出秘密一样傻
as much as I'd trust Marshall with Pop Secret.

301
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,242
我能保守秘密的
I can keep a secret!

302
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:23,294
为了保守秘密我能守口如瓶
I can keep a secret real good.

303
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,630
我保守秘密的时候 就跟这秘密不关任何人的事儿一样
I can keep a secret like nobody's business,

304
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,582
因为它本身就不关任何人的事儿
'cause it is nobody's business.

305
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:29,851
因为它是个秘密
'Cause it's a secret,

306
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:31,585
而且我没有把它说出来
and I'm keeping it!

307
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:32,553
马修刮后背吗
Does Marshall shave his back?

308
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:34,588
他才不刮呢 都是我替他刮 尼玛
No, I shave it for him. Damn it!

309
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,589
对了
Ooh!

310
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:36,941
我该给马修打个电话
I should call Marshall.

311
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,476
我敢肯定他也知道晚宴的事儿
I bet he's in on this.

312
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,594
如果他真的存在的话
If he really exists.

313
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:43,264
好吧
Okay.

314
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:45,232
我就不说我帮你隐瞒了
Setting aside the fact that I've kept your 

315
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:48,036
搬去芝加哥的事这个事实
whole "Moving to Chicago" Thing a secret,

316
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:50,938
你现在不是应该穿成李伯拉斯的样子吗
aren't you supposed to be dressed like Liberace right now?

317
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,490
好吧 首先呢
Okay, first of all,

318
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,125
如果我现在就穿着服装出现
if I showed up in costume,

319
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:57,295
会破坏我之后华丽登场时的惊喜和壮观场面
it would steal from the surprise and spectacle of my grand entrance.

320
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,080
其次呢 我不打算这么玩了
And second of all, I'm not doing that.

321
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:00,248
为什么啊
Why not?

322
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,617
因为打扮成列勃拉斯很容易 但...
Because dressing like Liberace is easy, but...

323
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:07,288
啊 对 四四拍 E大调...
Uh, yes, 4/4, E-sharp...

324
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,624
大三度...
major...

325
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:12,343
好
Okay.

326
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,847
咱们来制造点美妙的音乐吧 如何
Let's make something beautiful, shall we?

327
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:20,301
我觉得今天练得差不多了
I think that's enough for today.

328
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,405
好了 我已经分析出事情会怎样进行了
Okay, I figured out how this is gonna go down.

329
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:26,824
我们会"急缺"冰块
We're gonna "Run out" Of ice,

330
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,809
然后罗宾会让我去买
and Robin's gonna ask me to go get some,

331
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:31,412
于是 你们瞧 整个小镇唯一一个
and lo and behold, the only place that sells ice

332
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:35,450
卖冰的地方就在一家真人激光枪游戏厅旁边
in this whole town is right next to the local laser taggery.

333
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,118
我走进去 然后...
I go inside and...

334
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,252
惊喜来啦
Surprise!

335
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:40,621
美好的晚宴 家人和朋友
Beautiful dinner, family and friends,

336
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:43,124
免费的游戏代币还有经典街机游戏
free game tokens and an off-road arcade game

337
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:45,126
已经装备了无限制涡轮驱动
that's rigged for unlimited turbos!

338
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:47,045
这是唯一蠢到家的...
That is the single stupidest...

339
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,463
同志们 真不敢相信
Guys, you aren't gonna believe this.

340
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,682
制冰机坏掉了
The ice machine is broken.

341
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,633
坏了是吧
Is it now?

342
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:56,437
真见鬼呢 这种事儿能有多大概率
Well, dog my cats, what are the chances?

343
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:58,940
好吧 现在怎么办呢
Huh? What do we do?

344
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:01,642
呃 我可以出去弄点冰回来
Well, I guess I could go get some ice.

345
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:02,777
哦 不用了 他们会派人去的
Uh, no, they'll send someone.

346
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,479
行 好吧 非让我去不可 我这就去
All right, fine. Twist my arm. I'll do it.

347
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:05,613
不过说真的 哈
But seriously, Hmm?

348
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:07,398
你们把那边都布置好了吗
did you get everything set up over there?

349
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,067
食物充足不 枪支齐备不
Do you have enough food, have enough guns?

350
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,652
有没有给斯丁森奶奶准备超大号背心 她可是...
Did you get a vest extender for Grandma Stinson? She's...

351
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:14,122
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

352
00:11:14,124 --> 00:11:18,209
哦 宝贝 你好擅长掩饰哦 我好爱你哦
Oh, babe, you're so good at this. I love it.

353
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,161
好了 咱们在那边见吧
All right, I'll see you guys over there.

354
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:21,662
我是说 我马上回来
I mean, be right back.

355
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:25,466
巴尼 巴尼 这就是咱们的预演晚宴
Barney, Barney, this is our rehearsal dinner, okay?

356
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:27,168
不要离开这栋楼
Do not leave the premises.

357
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,970
跟我保证你哪儿也不去
Promise me you're not going anywhere.

358
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:30,054
好
Fine.

359
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:30,888
说出来
Say it.

360
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,391
说你保证你不会走
Say you promise you won't leave.

361
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:36,761
我保证我不会走
I promise I won't leave.

362
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,896
于是我走了 多么巧啊
So I left. And what do you know,

363
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:42,984
冰店的旁边就是一家真人激光枪游戏厅
the ice store is right next to a laser tag place!

364
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:45,386
根本不是 两家店相距六英里
No, it isn't! It's six miles away

365
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:46,571
而且在相反的方向
in the opposite direction.

366
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,406
而且我明明说了让你不要走
And I told you not to go!

367
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,607
是啊 不过你也说过
Yeah, well, you also told me

368
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,559
婚礼上不想要花熊
didn't want a ring bear at the wedding.

369
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:52,527
是花童
Ring bear-er!

370
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:54,728
我们都知道那会有多赞 重点是
We all know how great that's gonna be. The point is,

371
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,114
我顺着她的计划演
I played along with her plan,

372
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:59,733
还表现得很"自然" 这样就不会剧透惊喜
and I acted "Natural" So I wouldn't spoil the surprise.

373
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:02,487
我的七舅老爷啊
Oh, my goodness!

374
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,288
真人激光枪
Laser tag?!

375
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,407
或许我应该进去待一会儿呢
Maybe I should go in here for a minute,

376
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,126
只是去看看 没什么特别的理由
just check it out for no apparent reason.

377
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,743
哟 这是什么
And what's this?

378
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:12,246
我的免手提代币小腰包
My hands-free token satchel?

379
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:14,849
还有我的终身免费续杯根啤马克杯
And my free lifetime refill root beer mug?

380
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,970
那过去的两个月里
So for the past two months

381
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,022
我们借给你公寓用来
when we were letting you use our apartment

382
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:22,923
每周日晚上练习钢琴的时候
to practice the piano every Sunday night,

383
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:24,308
你都在干嘛
what were you doing?

384
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,479
哦 他是个MVP这就不算走步了吗
Oh, so that's not traveling 'cause he's the MVP?

385
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,479
{\a6}MVP most valuable player 最有价值球员

386
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,265
搞什么
Come on!

387
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:33,901
巴尼去哪儿了 有人见到他了吗
Where's Barney? Has anyone seen him?

388
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:35,269
罗宾 泰德完全放弃了
Robin, Ted's totally bailing

389
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:37,238
为你和巴尼演奏钢琴的事
on playing the piano for you and Barney.

390
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,875
哦 真的吗 泰德 你并不需要这样做的呢
Oh, really? Ted, you didn't have to not do that.

391
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:41,909
不过真是谢谢啦
But thank you.

392
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:44,629
但他保证过的 承诺就是承诺
But he promised! A promise is a promise.

393
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,414
你不能明明说好要做一件事
You can't say you're gonna do something

394
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,116
却突然去做完全不同的另一件事
and then suddenly do something completely different!

395
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:50,918
你为什么对这事这么生气
Why are you getting so worked up about this?

396
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,722
因为 很显然 我是在为另外一件
Because, obviously, I'm worked up for a different

397
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:55,756
与之类似的事情生气
but somewhat similar reason.

398
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:57,425
该有人来问问我了吧
And someone should ask me about it!

399
00:12:57,427 --> 00:13:00,178
不好意思 我现在没有时间陪你闹 莉莉
I'm sorry. I don't have time for your drama right now, Lily.

400
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,345
我的未婚夫失踪了
My fiance is missing.

401
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,231
马修被选中当法官了
Marshall got picked to be a judge.

402
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:05,433
他连问都没问我 就接受了这份工作
He took the job without even asking me.

403
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:07,968
意大利没戏了
Italy's off!

404
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:13,488
我的时间就是来陪你闹的
I have time for your drama.

405
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:20,416
-这么说 马修不能去意大利了吗  -如果他想当法官的话
-So, Marshall can't go to Italy? -Not if he wants to be a judge.

406
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,807
但我的意大利语现在说的可好了
And my Italian was getting so good.

407
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,920
特别的...
It was so...

408
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:28,020
\N我是一个工作到意大利的告别

409
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:29,520
\N好桑感

410
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:31,692
等等 你们俩已经把公寓转租了
But wait, you guys already sublet the apartment.

411
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:33,561
你的行李都收拾好了
I mean, you're already packed.

412
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,280
马修已经借走而且弄丢了我的罗塞达石碑
Marshall already borrowed and lost my Rosetta Stone.

413
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,280
{\a6}刻有希腊文及埃及象形文字的石板 用于研究古埃及文字

414
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,982
这个自私的魂淡
That selfish bastard!

415
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,301
抱歉 莉儿 喂
Sorry, Lil. Hello.

416
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:42,036
好了 我也很愤怒
Okay, I'm mad, too.

417
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,538
你就该愤怒
I should hope so.

418
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,023
突然之间 他的梦想就比你的梦想更重要了吗
All of a sudden, his dream is more important than yours?

419
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,692
而且他还背着你做这事
And he did it behind your back.

420
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:48,893
魂淡
Bastardo!

421
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,661
他绝对不会故意伤害我的
He would never hurt me intentionally.

422
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,413
我会故意伤害他的
I'll hurt him intentionally.

423
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,714
极其魂淡
Molto bastardo!

424
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:54,966
你这样说真贴心
That's sweet of you to say.

425
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,118
你再过一百万年也打不过马修的
You could never take Marshall in a million years,

426
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,970
不过你这样说真贴心哈
but that's sweet of you to say.

427
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:02,974
好吧 很显然 巴尼去了真人激光枪游戏厅
Well, apparently, Barney went to the laser tag place

428
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:05,643
去找他那个惊喜预演晚宴
looking for a surprise rehearsal dinner.

429
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,962
结果他没找到 就威胁要
When he didn't find one, he threatened

430
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:09,630
把零食柜台售货员的脑袋
to dunk the snack bar guy's head

431
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:13,267
塞进装满滚烫玉米片的大桶里
into a vat of scalding nacho Whiz.

432
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,936
他现在被扣住了 等着警察过去呢
He's being held until the police arrive

433
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,822
我得来点苹果汁
I need your apple juice.

434
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:22,910
然后就变成这样了
And here we are.

435
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:26,831
现在 我觉得猜谜游戏已经进行得差不多了
Now, I believe this charade has gone on long enough.

436
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,484
咱们快去那个惊喜真人激光枪预演晚宴吧 好不好
Can we please get to the surprise laser tag rehearsal?

437
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:33,037
嘿 根本没有什么惊喜真人激光枪预演晚宴
Hey, there is no surprise laser tag rehearsal dinner!

438
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,991
好吧 但我能不能提一个相反的观点呢
Okay, but if I may offer an opposing view.

439
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:38,626
当然有啦
Of course there is!

440
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,828
这地方到处都是线索
This place is lousy with clues.

441
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,298
这个人真的是个保安吗
Is he even really a security guard?

442
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,934
他看起来无比像一个非巴基斯坦版的
Because he looks an awful lot like a non-Pakistani version

443
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:49,937
我办公室的三明治外卖送货员
of the guy who delivers sandwiches at my office.

444
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:51,606
而且...
Also...

445
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:58,512
"真人激光枪"和"预演晚宴"的字数一样多
"Laser tag" Has the same number of letters as "Rehearsal."

446
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:01,732
"真人激光枪"有8个字母 "预演晚宴"⑨个
Laser tag has eight, rehearsal has nine.

447
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:06,287
而且如果你重新排列一下这些字母 再加上一些字母
And if you rearrange the letters and add some other ones,

448
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:10,541
就会变成 "准备好 巴尼 为你最大的惊喜
it says, "Get ready, Barney, for the biggest surprise ever,

449
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,894
你个帅气的小..."
you handsome son of a..."

450
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:15,362
后面没有足够的字母来拼"王八蛋"了
and then not quite enough letters for "Bitch,"

451
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:16,414
不过你已经尽力了 罗宾
but good try, Robin.

452
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,749
这也太疯狂了 巴尼
This is crazy, Barney.

453
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,918
我们的婚姻不应该是这样的
We-We can't have a marriage like this.

454
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,922
婚姻必须建立在诚实以及信任
A marriage has to be built on honesty and trust

455
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,308
还有各种莉莉马修的那堆什么玩意儿上
and all of that Lily-and-Marshall crap.

456
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,678
我以为我们的婚姻是建立在诚实以及信任
I though our marriage was built on honesty and trust

457
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,098
还有各种莉莉马修的那堆什么玩意儿上
and all that Lily- and-Marshal crap.

458
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,817
我觉得真的好孤单
I just feel so alone right now.

459
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:39,437
但是 你并不孤单 有我在呢
Well, you're not. I'm here.

460
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:42,990
我知道你能守住秘密
And I know you can keep a secret.

461
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:44,992
是啊
Yeah, right.

462
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:46,244
要不这样
Tell you what.

463
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,896
要不我告诉你另外一个秘密吧
How about I let you in on another secret?

464
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:50,865
更大的秘密
Something bigger.

465
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,867
比芝加哥还大吗
Bigger than Chicago?

466
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,371
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding?

467
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,341
不 可否赏光
Nope. Want to do the honors?

468
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,746
女士们 先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

469
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:09,083
计划有些小变动
there's been a slight change of plan.

470
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:11,018
好啦 好啦
Fine! Fine.

471
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,470
你说得对 罗宾
You're right, Robin.

472
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,306
婚姻不是整天恶作剧
Marriage isn't about playing crazy pranks.

473
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,425
不是处心积虑编一堆谎话
It isn't about telling long expertly crafted lies

474
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:19,527
去掩盖这些恶作剧...
to cover those pranks...

475
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:21,312
你是怎么解开手铐的
How'd you get out of those handcuffs?

476
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,481
...再请个演员扮演保安
...and hiring actors to play security guards

477
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,067
还斥巨资弄出来这些个大的要死的
and spending exorbitant amounts of money on things

478
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,119
假的真人激光枪牌子什么的
like giant, fake laser tag signs.

479
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,954
都不要 这关乎诚信
No, it's about honesty.

480
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,073
六码的冰鞋是吧
Size six skate, right?

481
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,124
是啊
Yeah.

482
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:36,494
正因如此 我要对你完全诚实
And in that spirit, I got to be honest.

483
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,080
从今往后
Every now and then,

484
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:43,284
我若对你撒谎 就是撒谎了
I am gonna lie to you. I just am.

485
00:16:43,286 --> 00:16:46,620
是为了给你准备惊喜的
If it's in the interest of an amazing surprise, that is.

486
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:50,891
你会被忽悠 哄骗
You're gonna get bamboozled, hoodwinked.

487
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:53,344
算了 直接说出来吧
Heck, I'll just say it.

488
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,063
{\a6}snow双关雪以及蒙混

489
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,063
你会被雪片般的谎言迷惑
You're gonna get snowed.

490
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,650
这里怎么下雪了
Why is it snowing in here?

491
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:00,818
穿好冰鞋
Put on the skates.

492
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,236
我们得走了
We gotta go.

493
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,021
去哪儿
Where?

494
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,307
我们是要去哪儿啊
Where are we going?

495
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:08,526
去预演晚宴啊 小傻瓜
To the rehearsal dinner, silly.

496
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,946
接下来就是见证奇迹的时刻
Let's get this party started.

497
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,917
什么
What?!

498
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,869
惊喜
Surprise!

499
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:22,173
这 这是怎么回事
What-What is going on?

500
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:26,594
我知道你非常想在加拿大度过这个周末
I know how much you wanted to be in Canada this weekend.

501
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:28,512
所以 我给你把加拿大搬过来了
So I brought Canada to you.

502
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,999
还有 这是韦恩•格雷斯基的签名照
Oh, and here's an autographed picture of Wayne Gretzky.

503
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,334
谢谢
Thanks.

504
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:36,470
还有这家伙也不是什么真的保安
And this guy's not really a security guard.

505
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:44,528
* 从前有一个男孩 *
Once there was this boy who

506
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:50,684
* 穿过无数西装 把传奇挂在嘴边 *
Wore a lot of suits and said that stuff was "Legendary" 

507
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:54,739
* 他无数次击掌 *
He gave lots of high fives

508
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,875
* 无数次起誓 *
And swore...

509
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:02,963
* 婚姻与他无关 *
That he would never get married

510
00:18:04,132 --> 00:18:06,334
* 他以为他非常坚决 *
He really thought he meant it

511
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,469
谢谢你让我参与其中
Thanks for letting me in on this.

512
00:18:08,471 --> 00:18:10,421
就算到最后才有我的份
Even if it was at the very end.

513
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,555
不胜荣幸
My pleasure.

514
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,090
哦 顺便说一句
Oh, and by the way,

515
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,059
我还有一个秘密一直没说
there's one more secret I've been keeping.

516
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,594
那些个晚上我不是应该
All those nights I was supposed

517
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,978
在上钢琴课的吗
to be taking piano lessons?

518
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,733
我其实 是在上花样滑冰课
I was actually taking figure skating lessons!

519
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,188
* 从前有一个女孩 *
Once, there was this girl who...

520
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,659
孩子们 花样滑冰可不是只要两个月就能学会的 
Kids, it takes more than two months to learn how to figure skate.

521
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,029
我爱你
I love you.

522
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,081
我也爱你
I love you, too.

523
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,617
-我会再回敬你一个的 知道不  -来呀 
-I'm gonna get you back, you know? -Bring it.

524
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:47,074
* 无数次起誓 婚姻也与她无关 *
And swore she'd also never get married

525
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:50,678
* 她以为她非常坚决 *
She really thought she meant it.

526
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:54,896
万万没想到这都是你做的
I can't believe you did all of this.

527
00:18:54,898 --> 00:18:56,731
你不是讨厌加拿大的吗
Hey, I thought you didn't like Canada.

528
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:58,650
开什么玩笑 我爱死加拿大了好吗
Are you kidding? I love Canada.

529
00:18:58,652 --> 00:19:02,887
{\a6}麝牛产于加拿大 多见于美洲原住民的图腾

530
00:18:58,652 --> 00:19:02,887
麝了个牛的 这位是加拿大传奇医生 弗雷德里克•班廷吗
Holy musk ox, is that the legendary Canadian doctor Frederick Banting

531
00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:04,022
哇哦
Whoa!

532
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:06,324
1924年 我发现了胰岛素
In 1924, I discovered insulin.

533
00:19:06,326 --> 00:19:08,193
接招吧 糖尿病

534

看啊 曼尼托巴的子孙 诺曼•布雷基
Hey, look, it's Manitoba's native son, Norman Breakey.

who I think worked for the company that probably created Wonderbra.

546
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:32,515
滚蛋吧 老掉牙的拖带
au revoir vieille gaine façonné

加拿大助攻赢了两次世界大战
