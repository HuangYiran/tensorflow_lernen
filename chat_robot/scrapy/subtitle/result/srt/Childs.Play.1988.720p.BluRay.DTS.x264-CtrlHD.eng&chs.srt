I already checked his closet. None of his shoes matched these prints.
我已查过他的柜子，他的鞋对不上这些脚印

308
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,306
Mommy? Mommy?

Chucky wanted to know what was going on.

Why are you treating Andy like this?
你为何这么对安迪？

他说了不知道那里为何有脚印，他就是不知道

你知道我的鞋为什么这么重要吗，恰奇？

339
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,893
You don't know either, do you?

345
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,801
Your doll?
你的公仔？

346
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,137
KAREN: Andy, that's enough stories for tonight.

Nothing.

Why didn't you tell me?

It's not exactly the kind of thing you tell someone.

Why won't you believe me?

- 什么？

Well, I'm a loose end.

You can't just let go what I said tonight without checking it out.

After I talked to you last night,
在我昨晚跟你说过话后

What do you think? The grigri work?

没门！你把我弄到里面去，就得把我弄出来！

an outrage against nature.
你的暴行违背了天理！

Tell me or die, John. Your choice.
