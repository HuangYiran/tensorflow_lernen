1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,300
就如你们所听说的一样
As you may have already heard

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,730
我们收到一份邀请
we've received an invitation

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,910
准确来说
Or, more precisely,

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,620
那是份邀请你们小队
Your team has received an invitation

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,620
代表亚特兰蒂斯出席
to represent atlantis at a meeting

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,460
飞马座星系的
Of leaders from various human populations

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,500
人类领袖会议的请柬
throughout the pegasus galaxy.

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,720
这是什么  飞马座星系版的联合国吗
What's this, a pegasus version of the united nations?

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,890
没那个正式
Nothing quite so formal.

10
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,090
现在  只算是个不稳定的联盟
At the moment, it's more of a loose coalition.

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,520
这个所谓的联盟有什么先进技术吗
Is there any advanced technology in this "coalition"?

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,520
没有
No.

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,170
但是国际勘察顾问组织
But the i.o.a.

14
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,870
认为这是走向星际政府
Believes it could be an important

15
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,190
举足轻重的第一步
First step toward interplanetary government.

16
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,150
联邦政府  可以这样说
A... federation, if you will.

17
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,750
联邦有战舰
The federation had ships.

18
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,490
出席这个对我们有什么好处
Look, what do we hope to gain from this?

19
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,820
那些人能相互认识的唯一原因就是
The only reason these people even know about each other is

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,550
他们碰巧都继承了
Because they happened to inherit

21
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,550
古人的星门系统
the gate system from the ancients.

22
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,230
缺少高端的技术
Just because they lack advancement does

23
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,250
不代表他们不能联盟
Not mean they cannot benefit from cooperation.

24
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,450
所言甚是
She's right.

25
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,780
这个星系的人们
It's about time people in this galaxy

26
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,290
也是时候要自己当家做主了
Got together and stood up for themselves.

27
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,820
对付幽灵族吗
Against the wraith?

28
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,490
有何不可
Why not?

29
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,260
幽灵人正在自相残杀
The wraith are at war with each other,

30
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,890
现在正是时机
Which is why the people trying to

31
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,050
人类有所行动
Form this coalition feel the time is right.

32
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,320
他们也希望我们能参与其中
And they want us to be part of it.

33
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,790
联络委员稍后就到
The council liaison will be with you in a moment.

34
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,290
他们还特意为我们铺了红地毯
Wow, they're really rolling the red carpet out for us, huh?

35
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,650
我觉得他们倒是想把
I'm sure they're just trying to keep

36
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,850
这次会议保密
the details of this meeting secret.

37
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,750
同志们
Uh, guys...

38
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,390
形势不妙
Not good.

39
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,390
若楠
Ronon!

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,500
这是哪里
Where are we?

41
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,530
已经不在接待室
We're not in the same room.

42
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,800
我们被转移了
We've been moved.

43
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,000
发生什么事
What the hell happened?

44
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,160
问得好
That's a good question.

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,500
这是什么意思
What is the meaning of this?

46
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,230
待会你们便会知晓
It will all be explained shortly.

47
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,670
现在传召谢帕德中校
The council wishes to speak to lt. colonel sheppard.

48
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,560
我是来自洛提雅的科洛
I am kelore of latira.

49
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,490
她是希安娜  来自圣佛部落
This is shiana of the tribes of santhal,

50
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,500
最后是迪默  代表里瓦自由人民
And dimas of the free peoples of riva.

51
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,930
我们都是联盟的代表
We speak on behalf of the coalition.

52
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,190
如果你们不想别人知道这个地方
You know, if you wanted to keep this location secret,

53
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,800
大可蒙住我的双眼
You could have just blindfolded me.

54
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,360
我保证不会偷看
I wouldn't have peeked, I swear.

55
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,590
谢帕德中校
Lt.Colonel john sheppard,

56
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,830
你站在此地
You stand before this council

57
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,830
代表了整个亚特兰蒂斯小队的全体人员
as a representative of the atlantis expedition.

58
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,030
没问题
Okay.

59
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,600
正因如此  你有义务对以下的指控做出回答
And as such, it falls to you to answer the charges.

60
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,130
什么
Excuse me?

61
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,730
你会有足够的时间进行自我辩护
You will be given ample opportunity to present your defense,

62
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,460
陈词之后  我们再进行裁决
And when all evidence is heard, we will decide the outcome.

63
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,430
你他妈的说什么
What the hell are you talking about?

64
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,630
这是什么
What is this?

65
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,140
亚特兰蒂斯小队面临着
The atlantis expedition has been accused

66
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,030
伤害本星系人类的多项指控
Of crimes against the peoples of this galaxy.

67
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,730
现在进行审讯
This is your trial.

68
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,830
少校  发生什么事
Major, what happened?

69
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,130
长官  我们也在想办法搞清楚这事
We're still trying to figure that out, sir.

70
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,830
但可以确定的是  他们不在那村庄了
One thing's for sure, they're not in the village anymore.

71
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,030
他们不会事前不通知我们就擅自行动
They wouldn't have gone anywhere else without notifying us first.

72
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,000
是的  不会自发行动
Not voluntarily, no.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,260
尽可能召集人手
Take as many men as you need.

74
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,630
进行全方位搜索
Search the entire area.

75
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,130
同时向村民打听他们的去向
And keep questioning the villagers.

76
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,530
肯定会有线索的
Somebody there knows something.

77
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,230
这本应是个友善的招待
This was supposed to be a meet-and-greet.

78
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,660
有鸡尾酒  精致点心小菜  舞蹈什么的
Just cocktails, hors d'oeuvres, maybe a little dancing?

79
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,160
借口推搪  在所难免
Subterfuge was necessary.

80
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,790
你们拥有的科学技术和军事火力
You possess technology and military power beyond the

81
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,630
在规模上和威力上都比本星系人类要大
Scope of most of the indigenous peoples of this galaxy.

82
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,000
因此  你们要被带到安全的地方审讯
Which is why you have been brought to a secure location.

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,700
只有议会成员和重要人员
Only the members of this council

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,700
才知道这里的星门拨号地址
and key personnel know the gate address.

85
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,260
别枉费心思  期盼有援兵到
So don't waste your time entertaining any hopes of rescue.

86
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,100
到底你们认为我们触犯了什么法律
What is it exactly that you think we did?

87
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,050
据统计  亚特兰蒂斯小队
According to our calculations, the atlantis expedition is responsible,

88
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,340
直接或间接
Directly or indirectly,

89
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,800
要对本星系2百万人口的死亡负责
For the deaths of over two million people in this galaxy.

90
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,130
开什么玩笑
You've got to be kidding me.

91
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,000
请陈述你们第一次和幽灵族碰头的情况
Tell us about your first encounter with the wraith.

92
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,560
好吧
Oh. okay.

93
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,930
我知道你要说什么
I see where this is going.

94
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,530
你到达的时候  幽灵族还在冬眠  不是吗
When you arrived here, the wraith were in hibernation, were they not?

95
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,900
并非个个如此
Not all of them.

96
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,260
什么意思
What do you mean?

97
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,360
我是说  他们袭击我们
I mean they attacked us.

98
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,760
那是什么
What is it?

99
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,860
幽灵人
The wraith!

100
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,760
击下那飞船
Take that thing down!

101
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,500
只是其中之一
That's one.

102
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,860
趴下
Get down!

103
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,830
泰勒
Teyla?

104
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,100
那只是一次侦查  并不是屠杀
That was a scouting party, not a culling.

105
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,460
我事先不知晓
Well, I didn't know that.

106
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,230
我只知道他们掳走了我们的人
All I know is they took our people.

107
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,400
然后你追击他们
And you went after them.

108
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,630
没错
That's right.

109
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,730
你该让他们自生自灭
You should have left them to their fate.

110
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,700
你们才会这么做
Oh, I'm sure that's what you would've done,

111
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,700
那可不是我们的惯常做法
but that's not how we operate.

112
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,260
后来怎么了
What happened?

113
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,630
我们潜进去
Well, we went in, we rescued

114
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,630
把人都救走  然后我们逃出来
as many people as we could, then we got out.

115
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,430
但是后来遇上了他们的女王
But not before encountering a queen.

116
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,330
是的
No.

117
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,800
这个你怎么得来的
How did this come to you?

118
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,160
不记得了
I don't remember.

119
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,500
引爆
Light it up!

120
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,460
你一定得死
That has to kill you.

121
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,030
长官  撤
Sir, let's go.

122
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,060
你不知道  你捅出个什么篓子
You don't know what you have done.

123
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:08,030
我们不过是沉睡中的族人们的看守者罢了
We are merely the caretakers for those that sleep.

124
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,630
我一死  他们就会醒觉
When I die, the others will awaken...

125
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,560
所有人
...all of them.

126
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,730
她说什么
What's she talking about?

127
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,030
外面还有多少幽灵人
How many are left?

128
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,760
如此说来  你承认了
So you admit it.

129
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,000
你唤醒了幽灵族
You woke the wraith.

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,530
他们醒觉也是迟早的事
Look, sooner or later, they were going to wake up on their own anyway.

131
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,500
但不是这一代
But not for generations.

132
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,360
中校
You see, colonel,

133
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,060
本星系的大部分人还没有
Most of the human populations of this galaxy have

134
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,200
从上次屠杀的阴影中走出来
Not yet fully recovered from the last round of cullings.

135
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,970
提前唤醒他们
As a result of this early awakening,

136
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,390
导致多个世界沦陷和灭亡
Several worlds have been driven to the point of

137
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,200
幸存者四散东西  他们的文明也没落消亡
Extinction-- their survivors scattered, their civilizations lost forever.

138
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,800
我们在外和幽灵人战斗  不分日夜
We're out there fighting the wraith, day after day,

139
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,460
我们的性命命悬一线
Putting our asses on the line.

140
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,530
但事实证明
But the fact remains,

141
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,600
如果你们不出现
Many who have been killed would be alive today

142
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,600
许多遇害者本可以逃过一劫
if you had never come here.

143
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,560
不是吗
Isn't that true?

144
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,930
够了  我没时间跟你玩
That's it, I'm not playing in this game anymore.

145
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,400
这只是众多指控中第一宗
This is just the first of many charges.

146
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,810
若你拒绝和我们合作
If you refuse to participate,

147
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,520
剩下的控罪会被判为罪名成立
It'll be taken as an admission of guilt on all counts,

148
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,500
然后我们唯有将你定罪
And we will have no choice but to proceed to sentencing.

149
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,830
那又如何
What are you going to do?

150
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,260
把亚特兰蒂斯的所有人都关进监狱吗
Put everybody in atlantis in jail?

151
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,760
很明显  这不可能
Obviously that's not possible.

152
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,900
但  我们能拒绝合作往来
However, we can refuse cooperation.

153
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,260
那就意味着停止商品交易  彼此之间不再牵扯任何关系
That means no more trade, no more relations of any kind.

154
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,730
亚特兰蒂斯将被孤立
Atlantis will be completely isolated.

155
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,160
不跟你们这帮人牵扯关系
No relations with the likes of you?

156
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,130
这不成问题
I think we can handle that.

157
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,760
联盟的体制与影响力在日益增强
The coalition grows in strength and influence every day.

158
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,410
很快
Soon enough,

159
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,990
你们当前的交易伙伴会别无选择
All of your current trading partners will have no choice but

160
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,700
加入并遵守议会的规定
To join and therefore to abide by the ruling of this council.

161
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,200
至于你的小队和你本人  我们要杀一儆百
As for you and your team, an example must be made.

162
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,300
这是公正之举
Justice demands it.

163
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,430
公正  你们管这个叫公正
Justice-- is that what you're calling this?

164
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,400
我们已经选好了一个荒无人烟的星球
A suitable, uninhabited planet has been chosen.

165
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,480
如果你们被判定有罪  就会被遣送过去
If you're found guilty, you'll be sent there, without any hope of return,

166
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,160
你的余生将没有可能再回来
For the rest of your naural life apparently,

167
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:27,660
他们所选的星球有足够维生的食物
The planet they picked for us has just enough food for us to survive,

168
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,660
技术上来说  并不是死刑
so, technically, it's not an execution.

169
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,360
太棒了
Great.

170
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,520
同时他们还有潜孔钻机
And they took the dhd,

171
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,930
所以不管谁一旦穿过星门  就再也回不来了
So whoever comes through the gate-- they're not coming back.

172
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,100
要是能有个地址
The  daedalus can find us.

173
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,870
泰达路斯就可以找到我们
If they had the address.

174
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:38,780
没有的话
Short of that,

175
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,500
他们就得搜遍银河系来才能找到我们
They'd need to search every solar system in the galaxy for a habitable

176
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,500
那差不多要花一百万年
planet, which would take, what, a million years?

177
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,130
对  我们不能慌
Right. let's not panic.

178
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,900
我已经在这地方待了一段时间了
I've been to the chamber a couple of times now.

179
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,760
我正在琢磨出路
I'm beginning to get a sense of the layout.

180
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,100
这里的建筑体系跟村子里的完全不一样
The architecture is definitely different from that of the village.

181
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,260
对  我们这是在另一个星球上
No, we're on another planet.

182
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,870
没有自然光线或者窗户
Judging by the fact there's no natural light or windows,

183
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,630
如此看来这是个井下储仓
I'm guessing an underground bunker.

184
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,900
卫兵呢
Guards?

185
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,460
嗯  六个或者更多
Yeah. half a dozen or so.

186
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,330
得想办法知道他们是否换班
We're going to have to see if they change in shifts.

187
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,500
无论如何也要让他们相信我们是无罪的
Any chance you could just convince them that we're not guilty?

188
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,600
事实如此  对吧
'cause we're not, right?

189
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,230
想想看
Oh, come on,

190
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,240
要不是我们的到来
There is no way the pegasus galaxy

191
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,900
飞马星系不可能有现在这么富裕
Would be better off if we'd never come here.

192
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,300
不
No.

193
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,500
相反的自从你来了  他们反而退步了
But since your arrival, there have been setbacks.

194
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,960
很多人丧生
Lives have been lost.

195
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,760
现在只不过是枯木逢春而已
But there is hope now where once there was none.

196
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,250
因为是我告诉他们去哪里做实验
As much as I'd like to tell these guys where to put their little trial,

197
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,830
在想出法子逃出去之前
We'll just have to play along for a while

198
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,830
我们应该暂时是盟友
until we figure out how to get out of here.

199
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,200
伍尔希先生  这是马瑞斯
Mr. woolsey, this is myrus.

200
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,260
他自称是新行星联盟的代表
He claims to be a representative for the new coalition of planets.

201
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,500
真的
Does he?

202
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,400
你是亚特兰蒂斯的指挥者吗
Are you the leader of atlantis?

203
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,960
没错
That's right.

204
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,960
我们得谈一谈
Then we need to speak.

205
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,130
议程上下一步要做什么
Well, what's next on the agenda?

206
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,730
这难道是我们最后一次踏足韦迪纳的玫瑰树林的事
Did we step on the rose bushes on our last trip to vedeena?

207
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,740
你应该听说过最近横扫几大世界的瘟疫了吧
Perhaps you've heard of a plague that's recently swept

208
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,320
这场疾病来得非常突然
Through several worlds, a sickness that arrives suddenly, runs

209
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,020
几天的时间就蔓延开来
Its course in a matter of days,

210
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,130
不管是男人  女人  还是孩子感染上了
And typically kills one out of every three men,

211
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,130
就有1/3的概率丧命
women, and children wherever it strikes.

212
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,050
有人坚信这根本就不是疾病
There are those who believe it is not a sickness at

213
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,500
而是蓄意的投毒  是个别人的行为
All but a deliberate poisoning, the work of one individual.

214
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,100
我知道你们在说谁
I know who you're talking about.

215
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,560
他叫迈克尔
His name is michael.

216
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,430
据说他既不是人类也不是幽灵人
It is said that he is neither human nor wraith,

217
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,300
而是混血
But some kind of half-breed.

218
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,830
对此  你有何解释吗
Can you explain to us how such a thing is possible?

219
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,260
我们中有人正在进行研究
One of our people was conducting research.

220
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,380
他们试图彻底解决
They were trying to come up with a way to

221
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,600
幽灵人带来的麻烦
Solve the wraith problem once and for all.

222
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,700
你们找到了把幽灵人转变成人类的法子吗
You found a way to convert wraith into humans?

223
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,360
别问我医学上的问题
Don't ask me the medical questions.

224
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,700
我可不是医生
I'm not a doctor.

225
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,260
那这个叫迈克尔的人是你们的测试对象之一吗
And this michael was one of your test subjects?

226
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,300
事实上  他是第一例
As a matter of fact, he was the first.

227
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,500
血压正常  脉搏平稳
Blood pressure's fine, pulse normal.

228
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,130
你现在复原得不错了
You're bouncing back quite nicely.

229
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,030
为什么说是复原
Bouncing back from what?

230
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,460
你好  迈克尔
Hello, michael.

231
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,800
还记得我吗
Do you remember me?

232
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,260
不
No.

233
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,530
我是伊丽莎白·韦尔博士
I'm dr. elizabeth weir.

234
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,130
这是约翰·谢帕德中校
This is  colonel john sheppard.

235
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,000
你是我的部下
You served under my command.

236
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,130
你的全名是迈克尔·肯摩尔中尉
Your name is lieutenant michael kenmore.

237
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:42,230
你现在是在亚特兰蒂斯的一所私人诊疗室
You're in a private room off the infirmary here in atlantis.

238
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,860
想起什么来了吗
Is that familiar to you?

239
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,030
亚特兰蒂斯
Atlantis...

240
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,200
对  是吧
Yeah. I think.

241
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,630
我们尝试着让他相信  他是我们中的一员
We tried to convince him he was one of us.

242
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,730
但他清楚有地方不对劲  然后他找出了证据
But he knew something was wrong, and then he found proof.

243
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,830
5毫克
Five milligrams!

244
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,800
放开我
Release me!

245
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,630
你将为此丧命
You will die for this!

246
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,430
其他人会来救我的
Others will come for me!

247
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,560
-他们会...  -省省吧
They will-- blah blah blah .

248
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,330
他们得先能找到我们再说
They've got to find us first.

249
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,430
得给你起个名字
You're going to need a name.

250
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,360
迈克尔怎么样
How does "mike" sound?

251
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,960
在那以后  他出逃了
After that, he escaped.

252
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,220
他在人类与幽灵人之中踌躇徘徊了很久
He went back and forth between wraith and human a couple

253
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,600
最终在选择了一个折中的地方定居下来
More times until he finally settled somewhere in between.

254
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,900
这么说来你再次承认了你的罪行
So once again you admit your guilt.

255
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,800
你们把这东西...放到银河系
You unleashed this...thing on the galaxy.

256
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,960
我们并不是主动放走他  而且也没有对其放任不管
We didn't just let him out the front door and forget about him.

257
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
自从他逃走那刻起我们就一直在找
We've been chasing him ever since.

258
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,200
几个月前   我们终于找到了他
A couple of months ago, we managed to catch up with him.

259
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,400
准备引爆
Fire in the hole.

260
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,960
发生什么事
What happened?

261
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,330
超时空引擎发生爆炸
The hyperdrive just exploded.

262
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,130
不  这不可能
No, that's impossible.

263
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,760
飞船主电力系统不足
Main power is out across much of the ship.

264
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,300
意外超负荷
An accidental overload?

265
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,060
那也不可能
It doesn't appear that way.

266
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,760
那是什么回事
How did they do that?

267
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,660
我去看看
I will look into it.

268
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,600
泰达路斯  请接入
Daedalus,  please come in.

269
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,430
谢帕德中校  你们的飞船怎么了
Colonel sheppard, what the hell happened to your jumper?

270
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,030
我在停车场上来回寻觅
Hell, I got all turned around in the parking garage.

271
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,360
匆忙之下  只好借用这架幽灵战斗机
I was in a rush, so I borrowed this dart.

272
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,460
我即将通过牵引进入存储仓
I've got the team beamed in to a storage device.

273
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,630
那巡洋舰随便你怎么处理吧
Feel free to do whatever you want to that cruiser.

274
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,830
马克斯少校  让那艘飞船消失吧
Major marks, please make that ship go away.

275
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,560
遵命  长官
Yes, sir.

276
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,900
你确定他已经死了吗
Are you sure he was killed?

277
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,100
整艘船都毁了  无人生还
The ship was vaporized. there was no body to recover.

278
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,190
也就是说你无法在议会跟古人的眼下
Well, then, you cannot testify before this council,

279
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,410
证明这点了
And under the eyes of the ancestors,

280
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,200
你不能确认他的死讯
That you know for certain that he is dead.

281
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,900
不
No.

282
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,130
这真是太无礼了
This is outrageous.

283
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,370
你这是告诉我  新政府成立的首要任务是
You're telling me that one of the first official acts

284
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,900
袭击并诱拐我们这些人吗
Of your new government was to assault and kidnap my people?

285
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,360
谈不上袭击
They weren't assaulted.

286
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,600
只是逮捕而已
They were arrested.

287
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,760
你这是跟我开玩笑吧
You've got to be kidding me.

288
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,300
相信我  不是所有人都同意这项决定
Believe me, not all of us agreed with this decision,

289
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,600
但是  事出有因
But it wasn't taken entirely without reason.

290
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,930
我们一直在努力帮助你们
We've been trying to help you people.

291
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,060
你们片面的决定无凭无据极不负责
What you've been doing is making unilateral decisions that affect

292
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,630
使数以百万计的人丧命
The lives of millions, without consultation and without accountability.

293
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,330
这样的情况我们不能再容忍了
This is no longer acceptable.

294
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,000
我不想和你在这里争论
I'm not going to get drawn into a debate here.

295
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,700
我想问你一句话  我们的人被关在哪儿
I only need to know one thing-- where are my people being held?

296
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,860
这肯定不能告诉你
Of course I can't tell you that.

297
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,530
正当的审问是不用遮遮掩掩的
Fair trials don't take place in secret locations.

298
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,450
就算如此...
Nevertheless

299
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,700
看来马如斯先生需要好好认清一下自己的处境
Mr.Myrus needs a little time to reconsider his position here.

300
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,300
把他押进牢房
Escort him to a cell.

301
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,600
立即执行
My pleasure.

302
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,360
你犯了个大错
You're making a mistake.

303
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,860
是吗
Am i?

304
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,940
当我被选作信使的时候
When I was chosen to deliver this message,

305
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,200
我就知道自己有可能回不去了
I knew there was a chance I wouldn't be coming back.

306
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,390
但如果你扣押我
But if you detain me,

307
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:34,560
就证实了许多人的怀疑
You will only be confirming what many already suspect-- that you're a

308
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,030
你们是银河系里无法无天的流氓群体
Rogue element in this galaxy, operating without restraint or due process.

309
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,260
把他关起来
Lock him up.

310
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,900
好吧
All right.

311
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,680
我不是说我们一点错都没犯过
I'm not saying we haven't made some mistakes,

312
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,060
可那是因为只有我们在战斗
But that's 'cause we're the only ones out there fighting.

313
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,460
没有其他人敢站出来对抗幽灵族了
Nobody else is out there taking on the wraith.

314
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,830
但那不也是你们的错吗
But isn't that your own fault as well?

315
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,830
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

316
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,860
杰纳人本来是准备去对付幽灵族的
The genii had a plan to combat the wraith,

317
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,230
而后来他们却没有  是因为你们背叛了他们
But they were thwarted when you betrayed them.

318
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,130
他们是这样说的吗
Oh, is that what they told you?

319
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,030
恐怕我有不同意见
Because that's not what I remember.

320
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,400
我父亲呢
Where's my father?

321
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,960
他没能活下来
He did not survive.

322
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,930
怎么会
How?

323
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:31,930
发生什么了
What happened?

324
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,460
我们会查明的
I think we should find out.

325
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,800
瞄准目标
Take aim!

326
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:48,060
科文  我们好像刚同意和平相处吧
Cowen, I thought we were just learning how to get along.

327
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,400
她杀了泰卢斯
She killed tyrus.

328
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
没有
No.

329
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,460
眼睁睁看着他咽气和杀死他没什么区别
By leaving him to die, you may just as well have killed him yourself.

330
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,710
我们要把你们的情报资料和飞船
We will keep this intelligence information and your ship,

331
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,400
加上所有的炸药全都扣下
And whatever quantities of c4 you have in your possession.

332
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,760
你们早就计划好了是么  利用我们
That is all you ever intended-- to use us.

333
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,530
放下武器
Your weapons.

334
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,260
不可能  开什么玩笑
No. I don't think so.

335
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,230
你父亲会死的瞑目吗
This is what your father died for?

336
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,080
对称自己为"朋友"的人撒谎
In the name of people who would lie and

337
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,060
并进行洗劫
Steal from those they would call friends?

338
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,000
我也撒谎了
Well, I lied too.

339
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,960
飞船2号  3号  行动
Jumpers two and three, execute.

340
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,230
你真当我们只有一辆飞船啊
Did you really think we had one ship?

341
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,960
这么说来你们是互相背叛了
So you betrayed each other.

342
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,000
我们只不过是有备而来  他们先动的手
We came prepared. they made the first move.

343
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,460
杰纳人的计划根本不可能成功
Look, the genii plan was never going to work anyways.

344
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,090
没有我们帮助  他们连炸弹都造不出
They had bombs they couldn't finish without our help,

345
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,460
而且他们也不懂得如何传送
They had no methods of delivery.

346
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:52,500
若想战胜幽灵  靠我们才有希望
If you want a military victory against the wraith, we're your only chance.

347
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,300
你和外星系的人联系过了吗
You've been in touch with our off-world contacts?

348
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,260
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

349
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,760
结果呢
And?

350
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,130
谁都不清楚状况
Nobody knows anything.

351
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,930
至少他们是这么说的
At least, that's what they're saying.

352
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,400
你相信了?
You don't believe them?

353
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,060
老实说  现在我都不知道该相信谁了
Well, frankly, right now, I don't know what to believe, sir.

354
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,720
他们应该是我们的盟友
These people are supposed to be our friends,

355
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,680
但如果我们就这样走进一个村庄
But if we can't just walk into an ordinary village

356
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,730
肯定会怕中埋伏的  怎么会这样
Without worrying about an ambush, what's the point?

357
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,590
还没到这地步
We're not there yet.

358
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,860
我不相信整个银河系都视我们为敌
I refuse to believe that the whole galaxy has turned against us.

359
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:19,030
最好如此  因为现在我们可以说是一无所有
Well, it might as well, because right now we have nothing.

360
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,730
也许不是
Maybe not...

361
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,200
跟我来
Come with me.

362
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,960
开门
Open it.

363
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,930
马卢斯先生  我有一个提议
Mr. myrus, I have a proposal for you.

364
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:37,500
你是说你们在军事上战胜过幽灵?
So you claim to have had military success against the wraith?

365
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,800
我们给他们造成了一定的破坏
We've done our share of damage.

366
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,230
甚至还能把一些蜂巢飞船转移
Even managed to take a few hive ships out here and there.

367
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,460
是吗
Really?

368
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,360
你们是如何完成这些伟大成就的
And how did you manage to accomplish this remarkable feat?

369
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,950
强调一点  这绝非易事
Well, I can tell you one thing-- it's never easy,

370
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,130
但稍使计谋  就能让他们自相残杀
But one good trick is to get them to shoot at each other.

371
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,730
看到了吗
Look. see that?

372
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,730
幽灵开始攻击蜂巢战斗机了
It's a dart firing at one of the hive ships.

373
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,590
为什么
Why?

374
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,260
谢帕德
Sheppard.

375
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,330
谢帕德居然能让他们自己人打自己人
Sheppard's actually getting them to fire at each other.

376
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,300
两架蜂巢飞船对攻的时候
If two hive ships are going at it and you happen to

377
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,830
无论你在哪一架上面  形势都不容乐观
Be onboard one of them, that can be a bit of a problem.

378
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,260
所以一定要随机应变
That's when you have to improvise.

379
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,200
泰勒  罗恩  进来
Teyla, lorne, come in.

380
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,230
中校  你在哪儿
Colonel, where are you?

381
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,560
正往你那儿赶
We're on our way.

382
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,200
赶快  那些蜂巢舰发现我们了
You must hurry. the other hive has found us.

383
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,530
你们能顶住吗
Can you hold 'em off?

384
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,630
顶不了多久
Not for long.

385
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,530
进入飞船停泊岗
Approaching dart bay.

386
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,960
收到
Acknowledged.

387
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,660
他们进来了
They're inside.

388
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,800
中校  我们请求立刻进入超空间
Colonel, request permission to jump to hyperspace immediately.

389
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,300
不行  我有一个主意
Negative. I have another idea.

390
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,300
泰勒  改变线路
Teyla, I want you to set a new course.

391
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
长官
Commander.

392
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,330
什么事
What is it?

393
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,360
我们刚从蜂巢舰那里收到一个紧急通报
We just received an urgent communication from the hive.

394
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,360
敌人正朝我们驶来
The enemy-- they're headed straight for us.

395
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,880
我还说过我们常利用古人技术
Did I also mention that we have a fair amount of ancient

396
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,760
真的非常方便
Technology at our disposal, because that can be pretty handy too.

397
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,130
有一架蜂巢舰正在朝你开火
There's a hive bearing down on your position.

398
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:44,860
是的  长官  我看见了
Yes, sir, I see that.

399
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,200
什么都别做
Stand by.

400
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,160
医生  我们会死在这儿的
Doc, they're killing us here.

401
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,330
我知道  我知道
I have it, I have it.

402
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,200
火链袭击
Firing drones.

403
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,060
让我想想  还漏了什么
Let's see, what else did I leave out?

404
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,660
都这么多年了  想全记住还真不容易
There's been so many over the years, you know, it's hard to keep track.

405
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,160
够了
Enough.

406
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,160
你把自己说得天花乱坠  中校
You spin a colorful tale, colonel.

407
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,730
这牛吹的还真大
That much is obvious.

408
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:27,060
全凭你一面之辞  没有证据不行
Yet for all these fantastic claims, we have no evidence but your word.

409
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,960
这次审问就是证据
This trial is evidence.

410
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,950
现在你们坐在这里审讯我
None of this would be happening-- your

411
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,720
要不是我们把幽灵族打退的话
Precious little coalition wouldn't even exist if we

412
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,390
你们这个小联盟早就灭亡了
Hadn't have pushed the wraith so far back that you

413
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,160
现在算是你们万年一遇的机会
Got an opportunity you haven't had in 10,000 years.

414
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,430
你们在这件事上需要负的责任已经很清楚了
Your responsibility in this has already been determined.

415
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,600
这个星系里的人口恢复之前
You woke the wraith early,

416
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,790
你们就唤醒了幽灵族
Before the population of this galaxy had sufficient time to recover,

417
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,930
导致了那些幽灵族在食物区开战
Which eventually led to the wraith going to war with each other over feeding grounds.

418
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,640
是这场战争给了我们机会
That war is what has given us this opportunity,

419
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,060
而不是你们所谓的胜利
Not some imagined victory on your part.

420
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,260
暂时休庭
We will take a recess.

421
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,200
请将犯人带回牢房
Please take the prisoner back to his cell.

422
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,260
伍尔希  你在这儿干嘛
Woolsey, what the hell are you doing here?

423
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,030
我和他们达成了一个协议
I've made an arrangement with your captors.

424
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,560
我来替你接受审问
I'm taking over your defense.

425
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,360
你不会带了一个子空间的定位器吧
I don't suppose you managed to bring along a subspace locator beacon, did you?

426
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,500
那是幽灵族的技术
That's wraith technology.

427
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,630
不是我们随手就能拿到的
It's not like we have one just lying around.

428
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,060
我甚至还去问过泰德  看看能否借一个
I even tried to contact todd to see if we could borrow one,

429
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,860
他都没给我回音
But he never responded.

430
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,390
用我们在星球上埋伏的拨号装置怎么样
What about the dhd on the planet we were ambushed?

431
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,690
可以查到最近拨出的地址
You could pull the most recent addresses that were dialed from there.

432
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,820
查过了
Already done.

433
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,490
缓冲区里有至少50个地址
There were over 50 addresses in the buffer.

434
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,730
我几乎把整个城翻个底朝天
I almost cleaned out the entire city sending people

435
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,190
派人寻访了每一处  毫无结果
To investigate all of them, but they turned up nothing.

436
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,260
他们带我们穿越了不止一道门
They took us through more than one gate.

437
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,560
貌似是的
So it would seem.

438
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,290
这谁都想得到
This was obviously very well thought out.

439
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,410
他们计划得很好
They had a very clever plan,

440
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,520
但我们更聪明  更有准备
But we're smarter and better armed.

441
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,620
周围肯定还有其他的路
There's got to be a way around this.

442
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,410
他们利用了我们最大的弱点
They took advantage of one significant weakness--

443
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,190
我们相信他们
We trusted them.

444
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,610
听着  我来这是因为
Look, I came here because

445
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,590
我想到了带大家出去的办法
I have a plan to get you out of here.

446
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,290
什么办法
Well, what is it?

447
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,160
赢得审判
Win the trial.

448
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:52,670
听着
Look,

449
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,630
我们一直在努力赢取
We were just playing along to buy us

450
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,090
足够时间离开这儿
Enough time to figure out a way out of here.

451
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,560
结果如何呢
And how's that coming along?

452
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,460
我们  我们还在努力
Well, we're-- we're working on it.

453
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,260
我是哈佛的法学评论员
I was harvard law review.

454
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,620
陆军工程兵团的首席顾问
I was chief counsel of the us army corps of engineers.

455
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,610
在此之前  我作为辩护律师
Prior to that, I was an appellate advocate

456
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,600
为哈茨霍恩和斯洛特上诉
For hartshorne & slaughter,

457
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,680
此案成为全纽约闻名的
One of the most prestigious litigation

458
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,760
经典案例之一
Boutiques in all new york city.

459
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:25,160
相信我  我能用一堆草纸告倒三个长老级人物
Believe me, I can handle three tribal elders with a stack of papyrus.

460
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,840
前些天
Some time ago,

461
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,250
人类世界遭到了
A number of human worlds

462
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,670
来自宇宙的攻击
Were attacked and destroyed from space,

463
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,820
不是幽灵干的  而是另有其人
Not by the wraith, but by someone else.

464
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,680
我们对这场神秘之战知之甚少
Little is known of this mysterious race

465
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,700
除了攻击者拥有超高的先进技术
Except that they possess incredibly advanced technology,

466
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,860
和他们来自亚特兰蒂斯联盟的传言
End are rumored to be allies of atlantis.

467
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,750
我想我知道你指的是谁  相信我
I think I know who you're referring to, and believe me,

468
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,620
我们不跟他们合作
They are not our allies.

469
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,720
他们叫复制人
They're called replicators.

470
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,960
是被古人创造出来的
They were created by the ancients.

471
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,680
你想知道我们的真实身份
If you wish to know the truth of who we are,

472
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,360
我带你去看
I will show you.

473
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,810
你们所谓的古人
The ancients, as you call them,

474
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,570
在研究如何打败幽灵的过程中
Were desperate in their search

475
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,330
举步维艰
for a better way to fight the wraith.

476
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,570
虽然人数上占很大优势
Though greatly outnumbered,

477
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,230
他们还是依靠科技的
They relied on their technological

478
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,430
优势占据了有利地位
Superiority to give them a needed advantage.

479
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,580
他们并没有一味制造
Instead of building

480
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,720
更大更强的武器
bigger, more powerful weapons,

481
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,360
而是选择制造小型武器
They chose to build smaller ones.

482
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,730
那奈斯（小型杀伤性武器）
Nanites.

483
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,790
这些小型杀伤性武器里
In these tiny killing machines,

484
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,040
古人们赋予的攻击能力
The ancients imbued an aggression

485
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,300
远远超过了敌人的
that surpassed even that of their enemy.

486
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,860
这项技术实现了有机同化
The technology allowed for organic assimilation

487
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,800
能让人自我复制  提高了效率
And self-replication to increase their effectiveness.

488
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,170
然而真的复制成功了
And replicate they did.

489
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,980
人数成倍增长
They grew in numbers,

490
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,560
速度让古人们都感吃惊
Evolving at a rate that took the ancients by surprise.

491
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,940
分子机器联合运作
The molecular machines began interlocking,

492
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,300
合力提供更多复杂生物
Assembling themselves to form even more complex organisms,

493
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,600
最终进化到他们想到的
Eventually evolving into the most

494
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,900
最高效形式
effective and efficient form they knew of.

495
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,700
于是我们诞生了
This is how we were born.

496
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,440
然而古人们发现我们成不了
When the ancients concluded that we would never become

497
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,530
他们设想的武器  他们决定中止
The weapon they desired to create, they decided to end it.

498
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:24,130
想把我们杀光  一个不留
So they chose to destroy us, to leave no trace of us behind.

499
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,230
但还是有些幸存者
Some of them managed to survive.

500
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,500
没错
That's right.

501
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,110
正如其名
And as the name suggests,

502
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:36,360
他们不断复制直至重建成一股强大力量
They replicated and rebuilt themselves into a powerful force.

503
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,260
天哪
Oh... my...

504
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,330
开玩笑吧
No kidding.

505
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,160
那他们为何攻击人类
But why would they attack human worlds?

506
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,950
这是他们对抗幽灵计划的一部分
It was a strategy they developed in their campaign

507
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:08,200
断绝他们的食物来源
Against the wraith-- eliminate the enemy's food supply.

508
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,400
还有一件事我不明白  伍尔希先生
There's one thing I don't understand, mr. Woolsey.

509
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,740
如果你说的是真的  他们最初是用来对抗幽灵的
If, as you suggest, they were originally designed to fight the wraith,

510
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,630
为什么要等到现在
Why did they wait until now?

511
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,600
我拿到点模块了  我们走
I got the zpm. we're leaving.

512
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,800
等一下  不能走
Wait a minute. we can't go.

513
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,200
你说什么
What are you talking about?

514
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,430
你说你能在线操控的
You said you could get the hyperdrive back online.

515
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,930
我说了  但不是现在
I mean, we can, but not yet.

516
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,920
听着  伊丽莎白联接的时候
Look, while elizabeth's been connected,

517
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,710
我们搜索了复制人的编码
I've been going over the replicators' base code,

518
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,500
我找到了这个
and I found this.

519
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,560
那是什么
What is that?

520
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,660
圣杯
The holy grail.

521
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,430
他们存在的唯一目的
It's their whole reason for being.

522
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:47,230
一个指引他们攻击幽灵的命令代码
It's a command code that directs them to attack the wraith.

523
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,160
对  但他们没有攻击幽灵
Yeah, but they don't attack the wraith.

524
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,960
他们已经在复制系统里住了N年
They've been sitting on their nanite asses for 10,000 years.

525
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,900
那是因为指令失效了
That's because it's been deactivated.

526
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,080
你是说是你们
Are you telling us that you are the ones

527
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,260
激活了攻击编码
that activated the attack code?

528
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,330
我们也不知道他们会攻击人类世界
We didn't know they were going to target human worlds.

529
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,600
但就是因为你们莽撞行事
No, because you acted rashly,

530
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,860
不计后果
without considering the consequences.

531
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,150
我们好不容易才有机会
We had an opportunity,

532
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,430
机不可失  时不再来
one that wasn't going to present itself again.

533
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,700
请相信我  我们并非草率决定
Believe me, councilors, this decision was not taken lightly.

534
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:17,260
其实我们已经损失了一名最优秀的成员
In fact, it cost us one of our best people.

535
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,600
伊丽莎白
Elizabeth...

536
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,530
快上飞船
Get to the jumper.

537
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,830
你跟我们一起上船
You're coming with us.

538
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:30,700
我马上就要冻不住他们了
I can't keep them frozen much longer.

539
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,000
我们不会把你丢下
We're not leaving you behind.

540
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,060
如果你现在不走
If you don't leave right now,

541
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,130
谁都走不了了  快走
none of us will get out of here, so go!

542
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,260
这是命令
That's an order!

543
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,230
快
Come on!

544
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,060
伊丽莎白
Elizabeth!

545
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,430
走!
Go!

546
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,950
你们死了一个人
One of your people died,

547
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,300
你认为这就是巨大的牺牲?
and you consider this a grave sacrifice?

548
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,000
事实上  是的
As a matter of fact, I do.

549
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,160
那考虑一下我们的感受
Then imagine how we feel-- those of us

550
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,660
我们眼睁睁看着无数人死掉
Who have witnessed the deaths of thousands.

551
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,900
复制人这么做不能怪罪到我们头上
We cannot be held responsible for the actions of the replicators.

552
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,980
谢帕德中校从幽灵的角度提出了同样的问题
Colonel sheppard made the same argument in respect to the wraith,

553
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,730
这种情况下我倒倾向于他的说法
And in that case I might be inclined to agree with him.

554
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,400
你也承认复制人是机器
By your own admission, these replicators are machines.

555
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,460
那是否我杀了一个人
So if I were to set a detonator,

556
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,930
可以说不是我杀的  是刀杀的
Can I then later deny responsibility for the actions of the bomb?

557
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,660
按你的逻辑  那古人也有责任了
By that logic, you might just as well blame the ancients.

558
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,960
古人创造了复制者
They created them.

559
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,700
你口中所谓的古人
The ancients, as you call them,

560
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,430
不在现场  无法做证
are not here to answer for their actions.

561
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,900
但你可以
You are.

562
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,420
到目前为止有六个人类世界
We know for certain of six human worlds

563
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,660
都被复制人给摧毁了
That were destroyed by the replicators.

564
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,790
但同时也有十几个
But we also know of at least a dozen

565
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,910
蜂巢战舰被毁
hive ships that were destroyed,

566
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:38,160
蜂巢战舰基本上一年之内都不会在战场出现了
Hive ships that would almost certainly have culled within a year.

567
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,850
总的来说  两相抵消
One could make the argument that, on balance,

568
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,230
获救的人比牺牲的人多
More lives were saved than were lost.

569
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,130
两相抵消?
On balance?

570
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,000
我们对你而言就这点意义?
Is that what we are to you?

571
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,400
一个一个死  最后都得死
Figures on a ledger?

572
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,630
游戏的规则是一命换一命
Pieces that can be moved about in a game of strategy,

573
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:54,560
有人获救就得有人牺牲吗
Some to be saved while others are sacrificed?

574
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,160
对不起
I'm sorry,

575
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,520
我也不想以牺牲为代价
I certainly didn't mean to diminish--

576
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,490
活生生的人被杀  伍尔希先生
real people are being killed, mr.Woolsey

577
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,860
村镇在倾颓  我的家园  我的同胞
real villages destroyed-- my village, my people.

578
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,130
我的丈夫和孩子在我面前死去
My husband and children-- murdered before my eyes.

579
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,530
你的星球也被复制人毁了
You're from one of the planets destroyed by the replicators.

580
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,770
我捡回一条命
I barely escaped with my life,

581
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:20,690
但眼见着我珍视的一切
But not before I saw everything I hold dear

582
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:26,060
随着一束光照便消失得无影无踪了
Get wiped out by a beam of light from the sky.

583
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:31,400
直到有人为此付出代价  我才会停止战斗
And I will not rest until someone is made to pay for it.

584
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,800
看来她是不可能投我们的票了
Well, I guess we can rule out getting her vote.

585
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,630
委员里不应该有这么偏激的人
It's clearly inappropriate for someone that biased to be on the council.

586
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,200
他们就会全体反对我们
So they stacked the deck against us.

587
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,460
我也不确定
I'm not sure.

588
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,060
迪默看起来还是挺讲道理的
Dimas seems to be a reasonable man.

589
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,160
我想劝劝他还是有可能站我们这边的
I think he might even be persuaded to vote our way.

590
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,030
不知道科洛怎么想的
Kelore is a little harder to read.

591
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,130
是啊  他貌似对我充满敌意
Yeah, he seemed pretty hostile to me.

592
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,900
你说他来自洛提雅
Didn't you say he was from latira?

593
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,160
是啊  没错
Yeah, that's right.

594
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,120
我们的一项智能报告表明
One of our last intelligence reports suggests a

595
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,330
洛提雅人和杰纳人之间的关系日渐紧密
Growing relationship between latira and the genii.

596
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:10,560
是啊
Yeah,

597
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,190
他以前是跟我说过
He did try to convince me that they should be

598
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,930
他们应该带头对抗幽灵
The ones leading the fight against the wraith.

599
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,400
你觉得杰纳人是幕后黑手?
You think the genii are behind this?

600
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,560
说得通
It makes sense.

601
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,760
除了亚特兰蒂斯
Apart from atlantis,

602
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,660
他们显然是联盟里最强的军事力量
They're clearly the biggest military power in the coalition.

603
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,780
如果走对了棋
If they played their cards right,

604
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,360
他们最终会掌控局势
They could wind up running the whole thing.

605
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,830
除非我们不插手
But only with us out of the picture.

606
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,230
原来我们一直是对的  事情解决了
So we were right all along. this whole thing's fixed.

607
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:34,590
我觉得应该实行B计划  等守卫进来  我就上
I say we go to plan b-- wait for the guards come in, I beat 'em up,

608
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,030
抢走枪  一路杀出去
Take their guns, we shoot our way out of here.

609
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,830
我们还知道路么
Do we even know the way out?

610
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,930
我们至少在地下二层
We know we're at least two levels underground and

611
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,460
不过十几个守卫
There's no more than a dozen or so guards at any one time.

612
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,760
那地面上呢
What about on the surface?

613
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,260
上面有多少守卫
How many guards are up there?

614
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,930
门在哪儿  有多远
And which way is the gate? and how far?

615
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,430
路上我们慢慢想
There's a few things we'll have to figure out along the way.

616
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,060
太冒险了
It's too risky.

617
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,660
出去之前我们可能就没命了
We could wind up being shot before we even got out of the building.

618
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,000
还有别的选择么
What other choice do we have?

619
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,960
我们肯定赢不了的
We know we can't win this thing.

620
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,360
不全是
Not fairly, no.

621
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,130
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

622
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:12,700
我是说既然知道游戏规则  我就能玩了
I'm saying now that I know what the game is, I can play it.

623
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,360
科洛  感谢你能会见我
Kelore, thank you for agreeing to meet me.

624
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,330
在外面守着
Wait outside.

625
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,470
我给了他一块父亲留给我的怀表
It cost me rather a fine pocketwatch that used

626
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,230
他才带我来的
To belong to my father to get him to bring me here.

627
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,360
你不用这么费心的
You shouldn't have bothered.

628
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,760
我什么都做不了
There's nothing I can do for you.

629
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,130
那就当我今晚特大方吧
Well, maybe I'm just feeling generous tonight.

630
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,630
有什么直说吧
Speak plainly.

631
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,330
你站错边了
You're backing the wrong horse.

632
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,560
我们知道你与杰纳人有联系
We know you're connected with the genii.

633
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,700
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

634
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,790
我还知道他们想成为
We also know they're looking to become

635
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,100
联盟背后的军事力量
The military muscle behind the coalition.

636
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,260
得做个选择了
We think we'd make a better choice.

637
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,330
你?  还是亚特兰蒂斯?
You? atlantis?

638
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,260
是的
That's right.

639
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,860
我还不知道你有如此雄心壮志
Well, I didn't realize you had those kinds of ambitions.

640
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,660
迄今为止我们都很满意
We've been content to keep to ourselves up until now,

641
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,790
但对于是淘汰出局还是积极参与
But if it's a choice between getting pushed out of the game and

642
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:25,060
结果肯定不言而喻  对吧
Taking a more active part, well, that's no choice at all, is it?

643
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:30,690
当然  也不能太张扬  得装装门面
Of course, for appearance's sake, we can't be too aggressive,

644
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:36,700
所以我们需要有人在内部接应
So we'll need someone on the inside to help push our agenda...

645
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,530
此人日后必当重谢
Someone to whom we'll be very, very grateful.

646
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,630
我如何确保你没有向别人提出请求
And how do I know you haven't made this offer to the others?

647
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:50,430
你我深知迪默只相信真理
I think we both know dimas will only be swayed by reason,

648
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:55,230
希安娜无论如何都会投反对票
And shiana's going to vote against us, no matter what.

649
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,060
就剩你了
That leaves you.

650
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,760
伍尔希先生  准备好面对最终判决了么
Mr. woolsey, are you ready to face the final charge?

651
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,430
是的
I am.

652
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:23,230
亚特兰蒂斯人民被起诉与幽灵勾结
The people of atlantis stand accused of conspiring with the wraith.

653
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,630
勾结
Conspiring?

654
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,210
有人举报亚特兰蒂斯与幽灵协商
We have reports that atlantis has negotiated with

655
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:30,160
并与其进行军事演习
The wraith and performed military operations with them.

656
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,500
据称你与其中一名幽灵建立了联盟
It is said you have formed an alliance with one wraith in particular.

657
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,430
泰德
Todd.

658
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:40,400
我们就这么叫他
That's what we call him.

659
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,330
他与谢帕德中校一同被杰纳人关进监狱
This wraith was imprisoned with colonel sheppard by the genii.

660
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,250
幽灵可以吃了他  尽管如此
The wraith was allowed to feed on him but, despite this,

661
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,200
谢帕德中校发现
Colonel sheppard realized that their

662
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,600
只有合作才有逃生的希望
Best chance of escape was to work together.

663
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,100
哪条路
Which way?

664
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,630
这条路
This way.

665
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,400
你们一直和这个幽灵有来往?
And you continue to have dealings with this wraith?

666
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,500
偶尔有接触
We have... occasional contact.

667
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,000
你相信他
You trust him?

668
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,230
当然不
Of course not.

669
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,060
但他有时很有用
But he has proven to be useful at times.

670
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:00,250
他帮助我们拖住复制人的飞船  争取时间
He helped us hold off the replicator fleet long enough for dr.Mckay

671
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,000
以便麦凯博士想出计划摧毁他们
To enact a plan to destroy them.

672
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,500
内部吸收
Interior suction.

673
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,230
将非关键系统的能量用于船体再生
Transferring power from non-critical systems to hull regeneration.

674
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,700
我们的防护快承受不住了  长官
Our shields can't take much more of this, sir.

675
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,100
可喜可贺  已经不用了
Hopefully, they won't have to.

676
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:31,900
准备将光子武器的能量转入
And get ready to transfer power from the beam weapons to the--

677
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,800
什么东西
What the hell?

678
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,860
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

679
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,130
他真这么干了
He actually did it.

680
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,830
得赶快离开这儿
We need to get out of here.

681
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,300
好的  走吧  快
Right. let's go. come on!

682
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,860
虽然很想  但我们不应该在这儿看着它垮掉
As much as I'd love to, we shouldn't stick around and watch this go down.

683
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,630
应该通知船队立刻去汇合点
We should tell the fleet to jump to the rendezvous point immediately.

684
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,360
星球不稳定了
The planet's become unstable.

685
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:41,300
事实上没有他的帮助我们不可能打败复制人
The fact is we would never have defeated the replicators without his help.

686
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,400
可以说他们将会一直攻击人类
I think it's safe to say they would have continued their policy of

687
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,200
那样的话  到如今银河系里的人就死光了
Attacking human worlds and, by now, everyone in this galaxy would be dead.

688
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,430
很好
Very well.

689
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:03,060
作为最后判决  我们将休庭讨论
As that was the final charge, we will recess to deliberate.

690
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,000
如果可以的话  我想做最后的陈述
I'd like to make one final statement, if I may.

691
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,700
说吧
Very well.

692
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:15,000
幽灵正在起内讧  但不会长久
The wraith are in disarray, but that won't last forever.

693
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,060
有一方迟早会胜利
Sooner or later, one faction will win out over the others.

694
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,370
一旦发生
And when that happens,

695
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:23,850
他们会将冷酷仇视的目光射向联盟
They will turn their attention to this coalition with a

696
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:27,530
这是你们闻所未闻的
Ruthless vengeance, the likes of which you've never seen.

697
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:37,610
如果真有这么一天  你们也不想要我们的援助
If you don't want us there when that day comes, fighting by your side,

698
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:41,560
请务必投我们有罪
Then, by all means, vote us guilty.

699
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,060
我不需要讨论了
I need no deliberation.

700
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,130
我提议当场表决
I say we get this over with now.

701
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,430
可以
Very well.

702
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:57,560
我赞成所有指控
I vote guilty, on all charges.

703
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,400
我不赞成所有指控
I vote not guilty on all charges.

704
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,530
就看你了  科洛
It falls to you, kelore.

705
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,730
你是关键的一票
Yours is the deciding vote.

706
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,830
怎么说
Well? what's the word?

707
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,230
无罪
Not guilty.

708
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,660
谢天谢地
Oh, thank god.

709
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,460
我们可以走了
We're free to go.

710
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,560
我从没怀疑过你的能力
I never doubted you for a second.

711
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,630
西装不错
Whoo, nice suit.

712
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,860
一上法庭我就想念我的制服了
Being back in the courtroom made me miss my old uniform.

713
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,200
不会吧
You're kidding.

714
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,930
不想工作  只想制服
Not the job, just the uniform.

715
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,330
味道不错
Oh, that's nice.

716
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:06,330
这样更好
Well, it seemed appropriate.

717
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:12,030
跟我说说你是怎么搞定的
So, you going to tell me how you managed to pull this one off?

718
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,470
要我说这是综合效应  我的法律技巧
Well, I'd say it was a combination of things-- my legal skills,

719
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:20,280
我的口才  我的论点  充满逻辑无懈可击
My eloquence, the indisputable logic of my arguments,

720
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,700
还有给科洛的贿赂
And the bribe I offered kelore.

721
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,560
是啊
Mm. yeah.

722
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,780
关键是
On top of that,

723
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,400
我得保证亚特兰蒂斯在银河系飞马座
I had to commit atlantis to a much larger

724
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,060
每天都参与到政治中来
Day-to-day participation in the politics of the pegasus galaxy.

725
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,930
得想个法子写进报告里...
A way to explain that in my report...

726
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:40,180
是啊
Yeah...

727
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,800
有影响力才是最重要的  对吧
What's the point of being out here if we don't try to make a difference, right?

728
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,030
希望勘察顾问组织也这么想
Let's hope the i.o.a. agrees with you.

729
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,330
这个不用急
Let's worry about that later.

730
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:51,860
现在  恭喜贺喜
For now, congratulations.

731
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,030
多谢
Thanks.
