1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,750
你愛上她了吧?
Are you in love with her?

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,750
喔! 才沒有 別說了 爸
Whoa! No, shut up, Dad.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,000
什么?      我要么作為自己去
What?        No, I either go as me

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,180
要么就不去了
or I'm not going at all.

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,190
不 滾開 想得美 蠢逼
No! Fuck off! Moron.

6
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,630
你不可能永遠不認我的
You can't...you can't deny me for ever, you know.

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,680
我還就不認了
Well, denied, mate!

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,540
是移植的肺
It was the lung transplant.

9
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,880
給了我操掉別人超能力的能力
I've got the power to fuck powers out of people.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,860
喂 喂 我有事跟你談
Whoa! Whoa! I need to talk to you!

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,010
是關于一件毛衣的
It's about a jumper!

12
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,810
早安 費利
Morning, Finlay!

13
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,800
不是吧
Oh, come on!

14
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,790
我操 是真的
That's...that's fucking it.

15
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,760
他滾蛋了
He's fucked off!

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,890
他離開我了
He's left me!

17
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,770
魯迪二號跑了 離開我了
Rudy 2's buggered off and left me!

18
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,520
他去哪了?      不知道 兩天沒見了
Where's he gone?        I don't know. He's been gone a couple of days.

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,250
我以為他會回來過夜 可他沒回
I thought he might come back in the night, but he's not.

20
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,290
他頭一次從我分離這么久
He's never been out of me this long before.

21
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,830
這是我的褲子嗎?
Are they my trousers?

22
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,630
對 該死 抱歉
Yeah. Shit. I'm sorry.

23
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,050
我正要問你借點衣服
I was going to ask if I could borrow some clothes,

24
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,930
我沒得穿了
because I've run out!

25
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,390
你打算怎么辦?      操 我才不管呢
What you gonna do?        Fuck, I'm not gonna do nothing.

26
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,690
他想一個人去忙他的 隨便他
If he wants go off and do his own thing, that's his decision.

27
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,440
謝天謝地 我說 終于自由了
Good riddance. That's what I say. Frigging free at last!

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,380
老天開眼啊 我終于自由啦      別...
Thank fuck almighty, I'm free at last.         Don't...

29
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,960
快住手
Stop it.

33
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,700
大衛﹒西蒙斯 是我一個同學 他長了尾巴
David Simmonds, right? Now, he was a kid at our school. He had a tail.

34
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,220
就好像脊椎末端長了塊沒用的皮
It was like a useless flap of skin at the base of his spine.

35
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,140
終于有一天 他把尾巴摘掉了
And one day, he had the bloody tail removed.

36
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,800
那就是我現在的感覺
And now I know how he feels.

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,560
摘掉尾巴了 伙計們 我們干了吧
To losing your tail, guys. Let's get in there.

38
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,320
可他是我們的一員
But he was part of the gang.

39
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,440
得了吧
For fuck's sake!

40
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,510
你是史酷比 他是小皮(史酷比的侄子)
He was Scrappy-Doo to your Scooby.

41
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,300
你當然是夏奇(史酷比的飼主)
You're Shaggy. Obviously.

42
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,440
那我是哪個?
Um...which one am I?

43
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,190
薇瑪      薇瑪?
Velma.        Velma?

44
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,970
嗯      戴眼鏡那個?
Mm.        With the glasses?

45
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,000
嗯      扯淡
Mm.        Fuck off.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,330
要是他把自己弄死了呢?
What if he's killed himself?

47
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,170
他為啥要自殺啊 費恩?
W-Why the fuck would he have killed himself, Finn?

48
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,570
他也不想的
He didn't mean to.

49
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:06,480
吃著橘子 戴上狗項圈 捆緊點 再緊點
Satsuma in the mouth. Dog collar on. Bit tighter, bit tighter.

50
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,030
夠了啊
Fuck's sake!

51
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,580
我走 我自己慶祝去 好了吧?
I'll piss off and I'll frigging celebrate by myself, shall I?

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,100
滾草
Fuck you.

53
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,640
你也滾草
Fuck...you.

54
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,110
你也滾草
Fuck you.

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,820
好好休息
Have a nice evening.

56
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,790
好白的屁股
That is a really pale arse.

57
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,040
你們干什么啊?
What the fuck, guys?

58
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,830
啊      好了
Aah!        OK.

59
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,570
老天 我怎么沒在床上?
Christ sake! Why am I not in bed?

60
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,510
早安
Morning.

61
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,000
早安 啊
Morning! Ah!

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,780
這都怪魯迪二號
This is...this is Rudy 2's fault!

63
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,110
我怎么能照顧自己呢
I cannot be expected to look after meself!

64
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,800
我才剛學會阿司匹林瓶蓋要用擰的
I've only just worked out them screw-top lids on them aspirin bottles.

65
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
好了 你先把褲子穿上吧
OK. How about you just put some pants on first,

66
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,760
然后再說別的?
then we'll talk about it?

67
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,100
伙計 把手紙用完了我能理解
Mate, running out of bog roll is one fucking thing.

68
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,650
可這也太過分了
This is bang out of order.

69
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,050
氣死我了
It makes my blood boil.

70
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,700
往前走兩分鐘就有垃圾站啊
I mean, there's a municipal recycling facility two minutes down the road.

71
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,750
真是渣滓
It's just scum.

72
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,030
沒人性的渣滓
Sick, inhuman scum.

73
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,550
我們還殺人呢
We kill people.

74
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,290
沒少殺
Frequently.

75
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,530
對
Yeah.

76
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,980
呃 殺人也很了不起的
Well, there's honour in killing people.

77
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,790
亂丟垃圾有個毛的技朮含量啊?
There's no honour in fly-tipping, is there?

78
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,600
喂
Hey!

79
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,980
注意那個人
Check this guy out.

80
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,550
他沒事吧
Is he all right?

81
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,750
你沒事吧 伙計?
You all right, mate?

82
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,610
你還好嗎?      他好像挺友好的?
How you doing?        Oh, he looks friendly, doesn't he?

83
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,870
你還好吧 沒事吧你?
How you doing? You all right, mate?

84
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,950
哎喲 還挺缺愛呢
Oh, shit! He's a bit huggy.

85
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,180
兩塊糖 牛奶加兩塊糖
Two sugars. Milk and two sugars.

86
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,090
牛奶加兩塊糖 快給他倒杯茶...
Milk and two sugars! Get the man a cup of tea immediately bef...

87
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,790
我了個大操的
Oh, my fucking God.

88
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,330
是他 魯迪二號
It's him! It's Rudy 2!

89
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,100
你去哪了 誰把你變成這樣的?
Where have you been? Who's done this to you?

90
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
能肯定是他嗎?
Are we absolutely sure it's him?

91
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,260
開什么玩笑? 看
Are you fucking kidding me, man? Look!

92
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,720
他看著有80了 可能還不止呢
He's got to be about 80. Maybe even more.

93
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,840
你記得出了什么事嗎?
Do you remember what happened to you?

94
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,680
哦
Oh.

95
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,350
是你      對
It's you.        Yeah.

96
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,790
一直喜歡你
Always liked you.

97
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,540
下雨天 你的頭發好漂亮
It's raining. Your hair's so pretty...

98
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,800
濕濕的好漂亮
when it's wet.

99
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,290
老天 這貨真是個呆子
Jesus Christ. The man's a fucking vegetable.

100
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,440
我告訴你怎么回事 是風暴
I tell you what's happened here. The storm.

101
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,520
肯定跟風暴有關
This will be something to do with the storm.

102
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,390
真的?      對
Really?        Yeah.

103
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,860
你覺得是?      嗯
You think so?        Mm-hm.

104
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,840
多謝你的線索 馬普爾小姐
Well, thanks for the heads-up, Miss Marple.

105
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,260
也許是因為
Maybe it's something to do

106
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,090
他去的那個超能力互助小組
with that super-power support group he's been going to.

107
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,740
他到底去那種小組干什么?
So, what does he need with a support group, anyway?

108
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,000
講出你的感受 這是示弱的第一步
Talking about your feelings - first sign of weakness.

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,680
你應該悶在心里
You should bottle that up inside you

110
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,760
把憤恨憋成鐵板一塊
till it becomes a solid mass of anger and resentment.

111
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,230
我叔叔彼得就是這么做的
That's what my Uncle Peter did.

112
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,020
沒錯 他喝酒喝死了 可這不是重點
Admittedly, he drank himself to death, but that's not the...point.

113
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,940
喂?
Hello?

114
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,040
他餓了
He's hungry.

115
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,120
火腿 雞蛋
Gammon and egg,

116
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,320
還有魚 還有...
and fish and...

117
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,160
他要火腿
He wants gammon.

118
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,430
我也沒辦法 從售貨機給他弄點東西
Well, I don't know. Get him some from a vending machine?

119
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,340
趕快
'OK, hurry up.'

120
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,410
這都應該是你的事 不是我的
You need to be the one dealing with this, not me.

121
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:54,930
哦
Oh...

122
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,780
各位 就是這里了      好
Guys, this is it.        Right.

123
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,100
什么計划?
What's the plan?

124
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,570
計划是...我們進去
The plan is...we go in there

125
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:07,630
問問誰把魯迪二號變成了老頭
and we ask 'em which one turned Rudy 2 into an old man.

126
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,750
什么爛計划      是嗎?
Shit plan.        Is it?

127
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,470
如果魯迪二號常來 他們會以為你是他
If Rudy 2's a regular at this group, they're going to think you're him.

128
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,340
進去臥底 假裝成他
Go undercover, pretend to be him

129
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,170
凶手看見你一定會驚訝
and whoever did it'll be surprised to see you.

130
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,920
他們會自動暴露的
They'll give themselves away.

131
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,460
太天才了 我需要這些對嗎?
That is genius. Here's what I need, right?

132
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,140
我需要假胡子 一副眼鏡
I need a beard. I need some glasses.

133
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,200
我需要煙斗 斗篷 再找根拐棍
I need a pipe. I want a cloak. Get me a staff of some kind.

134
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,890
你需要像二號那樣
You need to look like Rudy 2,

135
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,330
不然他們就不會以為你是他了
or they're not gonna think you're him.

136
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,240
這家伙 中考八門合格
This guy, eight GCSEs.

137
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,680
我們去臥底吧
Let's go undercover.

138
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,550
魯迪二號 你近來可好?
Rudy 2. How you doing?

139
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:07,200
我想你們一定...見到我很驚訝吧
I would imagine you're... quite surprised to see me, guy.

140
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,050
也沒有啊 你每周二都會來嘛
Not really. Um... you always come on a Tuesday.

141
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,520
只能說 老習慣成自然
Let's just say that old habits... die hard.

142
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,090
"老"習慣
OLD...habits.

143
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,400
我叫費恩      很高興見到你 嗨
I'm Finn.        Nice to meet you. Hi.

144
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,650
別理我 我是來蹭餅干吃的
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm just here for the biscuits.

145
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:23,880
她確實是
She is.

146
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,440
你有什么能力?
So, what's your power?

147
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,640
隔空...      他會產奶
Teleke...        Milky nipples.

148
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,230
嗯?      產奶
Hm?        Milky nipples.

149
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,970
他只要一撒謊 乳頭就出奶
Cos every time he tells a lie, he just expresses milk from his nipples.

150
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,560
太荒謬了 他很尷尬
It's ridiculous. He's very embarrassed about it.

151
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,550
抱歉失陪了
Now, you're going to have to excuse us,

152
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,660
我們還得跟其他人說話呢
cos we do have other people we need to speak to.

153
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,580
費利
Finlay.

154
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,810
什么叫他媽的產奶?
What was all that with the fucking milky nipples?

155
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,670
計划是怎樣的 費恩 還記得嗎?
What was the plan, Finn? Can you remember it?

156
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,290
計划是 我們不暴露真實的能力
The plan was, we don't tell anyone what our real powers are.

157
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,220
計划里沒有這部分
That was nothing to do with the plan.

158
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,040
沒有嗎?      沒有
Was it not?        No!

159
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,390
認真聽我說 兄弟
Now, listen to me, dude, seriously.

160
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,160
這里有個人知道魯迪二號的事 我建議分頭找
Someone here knows something about Rudy 2. I suggest we just split up.

161
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,480
嗯 我覺得我們應該...      滾開
Yeah, I think we should just...       Fuck off.

162
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,500
為什么餅干旁邊有只烏龜?
Why is there a turtle by the biscuits?

163
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,810
他每周都來 是個有超能力的人
He turns up every week. It's someone with a power.

164
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,160
這里面有個人?
There's someone inside of there?

165
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,730
對
Yeah.

166
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,440
他叫馬克
His name's Mark.

167
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,860
你好啊 兄弟
All right, mate?

168
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,820
不用不好意思
You don't have to be embarrassed.

169
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,210
關于你的...能力
About your, um... Your power.

170
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,950
你呢 你的能力是什么?      我? 哦
How about you? What's... What's your power?        Me? Oh.

171
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:50,140
一言...難盡 我不想說
It's, er...it's complicated. I don't really like to talk about it.

172
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,160
沒關系 不想說不勉強
It's all right. You don't have to, if you don't want to.

173
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,210
問題是 別的人...
The thing is, other people...

174
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:59,110
總是亂猜我的...
make certain assumptions about my...

175
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,010
性取向 而且...
...sexuality, and...

176
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,560
怎么 他們以為你是同性戀?
What, they... They think you're gay?

177
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,550
對 我覺得他們是這么以為的
Yeah, yeah. I...I guess they do.

178
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,640
那...你是同性戀嗎?
And...a-are you gay?

179
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,700
不是
No!

180
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,510
現在你知道了
Now you know.

181
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,380
不是吧
Fuck off!

182
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,170
你... 你真的出不了柜了
You're... You're literally trapped in the closet?

183
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,980
太好笑了吧?
How funny's that?

184
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,750
而且非常嚴重
And also very serious.

185
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,410
太傷人了
Quietly poignant.

186
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:46,850
沒錯
Yeah.

187
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,720
其實 我有個朋友能移除超能力
Actually, I've got a friend who can take powers.

188
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,440
他怎么移除 有什么辦法?
How does he take powers? How does it work?

189
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,670
我讓他自己告訴你細節吧
I'll let him fill you in on the details.

Y-You were saying that at times you're ashamed of him,

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,360
他讓你覺得丟人

Cornetto, chair. It's like the frigging Ritz in here.

266
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,020
好好玩 別一下全吃完了 一會兒見
Have fun. Don't eat it all at once. See you in a bit.

267
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,270
你是亞歷克斯嗎?
Are you Alex?

268
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,910
你朋友說你能移除超能力
Your mate said you'd take my power.

269
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,170
什么朋友?
What mate?

270
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,580
乳頭會產奶那個
Your mate with the milky nipples.

271
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,230
抱歉 誰?      矮個子的
What? Sorry?        He was short.

272
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,320
哦 費恩 小猴崽子
Oh, Finn. You monkey-faced fuck.

273
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,040
呃 請別介意 但我不幫男的
Er...look, no offence, mate, but I don't really do blokes.

274
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,650
這是什么意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

275
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,750
就是我不想和男人上床
It means I'm not into having sex with men.

276
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,790
你以為我是基佬?
What, you think I'm gay?

277
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,420
我不管你是什么
I don't really care what you are.

278
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,970
聽著 我才不是基
Look, I'm not gay!

279
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,060
就是這里 她叫瑪吉
This is it. Her name's Maggie.

280
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,240
好吧 瑪吉
All right, Maggie.

281
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,980
出來混總是要還的 婊子
It's time to pay the fucking piper, biatch.

282
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,200
我操
Bosh!

283
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,850
你干什么?
What are you doing?

284
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,160
我以為這是計划的一部分
Well, I thought it was part of the plan!

285
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,520
我們直接敲門就好
We could have just knocked.

286
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,470
沒時間敲門了 費利 還要我說出來嗎
It's too late to frigging knock now, Finlay, for crying out loud!

287
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,720
沒時間敲門了吧?
IS it too late to knock?

288
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,370
操 我現在敲吧 看她怎么說
Shit, I'm just gonna knock, man, see what she's saying.

289
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,320
有人嗎?
Yoo-hoo?

290
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,170
她來了 我怎么說?
Here she comes. What do I say?

291
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,620
說對不起
Say sorry.

292
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,920
你好嗎 親愛的?
All right, love?

293
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,290
你為什么打破我的門?
Why did you break my door?

294
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,570
因為我...
Because I...

295
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,200
我以為你摔倒了...
I thought you'd fallen...over...

296
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,830
扭了腰
..and broken your hip.

297
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,730
來幫我把拼圖拼了 然后把鎖修好
Well, you can fix that lock when you've helped me with my jigsaw.

298
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,930
哦 上帝
Oh...God.

299
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,960
我有只貓
I have a cat.

300
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,340
她可能會想吃你的奶
She may try to drink from your nipples.

301
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,670
你干什么?      合不上啊
What are you doing?        It just fucking won't fit.

302
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,930
首先要找到邊 再朝里推進
You need to find the edges first, work from the outside in.

303
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,900
這是常識      哦 拜托...
Basic puzzling.        Oh, just...

304
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,120
拼你的拼圖 兄弟
the jigsaw, man.

305
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,760
我去臥底了
I'm going undercover.

306
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,240
問問她知道什么
I'm going to see what she knows.

307
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,180
好嗎?      好
Yeah?        Yes.

308
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,220
所以 瑪吉
So...Maggie.

309
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,370
你一定... 沒想到會見到我吧
I suppose you're... quite surprised to see me.

310
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,430
不是嗎?
Aren't you?

311
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,250
今天周三 你每周三都來
It's Wednesday. You always come Wednesday.

312
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,340
手伸出來
Hands.

313
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
哦
Oh...

314
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,030
所以...
So...

315
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,290
那個混蛋魯迪一號最近對你如何?
how's that awful Rudy 1 treating you?

316
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,050
他不是混蛋 他就... 就是有點被誤會
He's not awful. He's just... He's a bit misunderstood, that's all.

317
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,610
我說多少遍了 你該離開他
You should leave him. I'm sick of telling you.

318
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,220
也許他需要我
Well, maybe he needs me.

319
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,810
也許他該學著照顧自己了
And perhaps it's time he learnt to look after himself.

320
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,710
恕我直言
Well, with all due respect,

321
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,000
也許你他媽該學會少管閑事 瑪格麗特
perhaps it's time you minded your own fucking beeswax, Margaret.

322
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,630
我不喜歡你今天的腔調 魯迪二號
I don't think I care for your tone today, Rudy 2.

323
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,440
對不起 我不該罵人
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have sworn.

324
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,220
去臥室
Bedroom.

325
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,510
把淺粉色線團拿來
There's a ball of pale pink.

326
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,750
快去呀
Well, go on.

327
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,100
耶
Yes.

328
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,100
四角找全了
All four corners.

329
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,320
哼
Huh.

330
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,610
這都是有意義的
They all mean something.

331
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:26,990
是什么呢?
Who knows what?

332
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,220
他們總會知道的
They'll find out eventually.

333
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,210
誰會?
Who will?

334
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,300
毛衣上的人
The people on the jumpers.

335
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,290
這是他們的未來
It's their future.

336
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,860
你該走了
You'd better be going.

337
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,100
你周三不是還要見提姆嗎?
Don't you usually meet up with Tim on a Wednesday?

338
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,970
哦 提姆 當然
Oh! Tim! Course I do!

339
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,190
提姆 提姆可不等人 沒錯
Tim...Tim. Tim waits for no man, as it t'were.

340
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,630
不過說真的
Seriously, though.

341
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,910
我行事歷丟了 我忘了
I've mislaid my old Filofax. Can't remember.

342
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,880
在哪見提姆來著?
Where exactly do I meet Tim?

343
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,730
她能織出預言
She knits the future.

344
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,070
真是非傳統的能力啊 是吧?
It's not exactly your classic super-power, is it?

345
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,030
嗨
Hey.

346
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,710
我得跟你談談
I need to talk to you.

347
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,690
哦
Oh.

348
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,500
所以
So...

349
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:13,140
提姆? 我想...你見到我一定很意外吧
Tim? I suppose you're, er... quite surprised to see me.

350
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,100
我們單獨談一分鐘
Give us a minute.

351
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,450
別走 你去哪 兄弟? 坐這別動
Stay. Where you going, dude? Stay there.

352
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,290
提姆 提姆?
Tim? Tim?

353
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,130
又發生了      嗯?
It happened again.        Hm?

354
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,420
我今早醒來 發現了這個
I woke up this morning and I found this.

355
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,160
哦我操... 你是不是... 這是槍哎
Oh, for fuck... Do you...? What? Fucking gun!

356
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,260
我不知道哪來的 反正肯定沒好事
I don't know where it came from, but it can't be good.

357
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,370
幫幫我
Help me.

358
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,140
求你 告訴我該怎么辦
Just please tell me what to do.

359
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,550
好吧 不是我要告訴你該怎么辦
All right, instead of me telling you what I think you should do,

360
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:55,050
也許你該告訴我 你打算怎么辦 提姆
maybe you should tell me what YOU think you should do, Tim.

361
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,210
我得彈一下手環
I need to snap the band.

362
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,370
提醒自己 這是現實
Remind myself that this is real.

363
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,850
這不是游戲
That it's not a game.

364
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,870
好主意 那就彈吧
Cool. Well, then, just snap it.

365
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,680
彈手環 提醒你自己這是現實 然后...
You snap the band, remind yourself it's real and...

366
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,180
怎么了 哥們?
Well, what, dude?

367
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,030
什么...
What...?

368
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,660
什么情況? 你有點緊張啊
What's the matter, dude? You're getting a bit twitchy.

369
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,070
別拿出來 我操拜托 快拿開
Let's not get that out... For fuck's sake, put it away.

370
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,450
他們會報警的
They'll ring the fucking police.

371
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,110
不不不 我操 拜托

Fucking snap the band, Tim. Snap the fucking band!

374
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,010
快他媽彈手環 快他媽彈手環
Snap the fucking band. Snap the fucking band.

375
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,690
把槍收回包里去
Put the fucking gun in the bag.

376
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,330
老兄 快把槍收起來 老天在上 提姆 我操
Dude, put the fucking gun in the bag. For Christ's sake, Tim! Shit!

377
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,950
謝謝
Thanks.

378
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,500

你真是個好朋友
You're a good friend.

380
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,710
你也不壞 費利 把那玩意喝掉
You're not so bad yourself. Finlay, dude, drink that shit up.

381
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,060
他到底為啥幫這些人?
Why the fuck does he help these people?

382
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,730
他連說都沒說過 他誰也沒告訴
And he doesn't even go on about it, he doesn't tell anyone.

383
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,830
我捐了2毛錢給抗癌中心 至今我還挂在嘴邊
I?I gave 20p to Cancer Research. I'm still going on about it.

384
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,820
你沒事吧?      我有件事要做
Are you all right?        There's something I need to do.

385
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,690
我回頭打給你      好
I'll call you later.        OK.

386
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,710
他在這兒呢
Here he is.

387
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,290
狡猾的銀狐狸 你去哪...
The silver fox, where...

388
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,670
我操
Shit!

389
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,300
你把他關壁櫥里了
You locked him in a fucking cupboard!

390
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,310
哼 理論上講那不是壁櫥
Huh. Well, technically, that's not a cupboard.

391
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,910
那是個儲藏室啊 對吧?
That's a bloody storeroom, innit?

392
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,410
不 這不是開玩笑
No, this isn't a fucking joke.

393
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,700
我就走開五分鐘
It was only five minutes while I was...

394
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,480
所有事都要我管 所以...
I was taking care of everything. So...

395
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,720
你走開五分鐘去撒尿我也不管
I don't care if it's for five minutes while you go for a piss.

396
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,990
好吧 老天啊 我道歉好不好
All right. Jesus Christ, I'm fucking sorry, like.

397
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,170
你看看他
Look at him!

398
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:42,940
你看看他
Look at him!

399
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,150
這不是玩笑
This is not a joke!

400
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,580
這不是生活中一點小麻煩
This is not some minor inconvenience to your day!

401

這不是外人

他是魯迪二號 你的一部分
He's Rudy 2 and he's a part of you!

403
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,230
好吧
All right.

404
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,350

去睡一覺吧 我去弄我們的晚餐
Go and get some bloody shut-eye. I'll go and get our dinner.

415
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,270
我沒打算變成這樣的
I didn't mean for it to happen like this.

416

我一輩子都在等待這種感覺
I've waited my whole life to feel this way...

418
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,770
現在我得到了她 我...

419
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,310
我不能再讓她走了
I can't just let her go again.

420

我回來了 我不會再離開你的
I'm here now and I won't leave you.

435
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:33,540
好吧 在我找到辦法把他復原之前
Now then, until I can figure out how to get him back to normal,

436
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,140
我們得輪流照看他
we're all gonna take turns helping,

437
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,670
所以我列了個簡單的輪班表
so I've drawn out a simple rota system.

438
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,250
按顏色標明 手寫的
That's colour-coded and handwritten.

439

447
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,420
我還要說

448
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,070
他也照料過你們每個人
he'd have done the same for each and every one of you,

449
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,750
因為他真是個大好人

動起來吧 各位
Let's do this. Come on, guys.

452
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:34,040
# 我聽說了昨晚的好消息

# 昨晚的好消息

457
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,330
# 所以別驚訝

458
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:03,040
# 這些事注定要發生
# These things must come to pass... #

459
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,070
亞歷克斯 幫我個小忙好嗎?
Um...Alex, will you do me a quick favour?

460
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,520
能不能操我的烏龜?
Will you fuck my tortoise?

461
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,700
給我一分鐘 考慮一下
Um...just give me a minute to think about...that.

462
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:18,220
實際上 用不了一分鐘 答案是不行
Er...actually, I don't need a full minute. It's a no.

463
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,870
這是個人 他叫馬克
It's a man and his name's Mark.

464
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,890
他被困在里面 沒法逃脫
He's trapped in here and he can't get out.

465
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,890
真是悲劇啊      嗯
That is really tragic.        Mm.

466
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,030
可我還是不會操你的烏龜
But I'm still not fucking your tortoise.

467
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,460
你根本不理解 對嗎?
You have no idea, do you?

468
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,920
我知道了我的超能力 一點用都沒有
I found out what my power is and it's totally useless.

469
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,130
根本誰也幫不了
There's nothing I can do to help anyone.

470
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,330
可你 你能作出改變
But you... You can make a difference.

471
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,640
我們中只有你能改變別人的人生
You're the only one out of us who can actually change people's lives.

472
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:47,400
可你做了什么呢? 袖手旁觀
And what are you doing about it? Nothing.

473
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,370
坐在那一動不動
It's just sat there in your pants.

474
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,910
把超能力用起來 亞歷克斯
Use your power, Alex.

475
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,700
幫助別人
Help people.

Be a superhero.

477
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,710
操了這只烏龜吧 亞歷克斯
Fuck the tortoise, Alex.

478

There you go. All right, let's get...

481

你穿的什么東西?
What the frigging hell are you wearing?

482
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,810
毛衣 瑪吉給我織的
My jumper. Maggie made it for me.

483
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,340
他說冷 我在沙發底下找到的
He was cold. I found it under the sofa.

484
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,680

That's fucking me! That's me! I'm fucking flying! Look!

485
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,590
你說什么?
What you talking about?

486
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,480
這是未來的我 我就知道 我就知道
It's the future. That is me, that. I fucking knew...I knew it!

487
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,110
哦 這只是件毛衣
Oh, it's just a jumper.

488
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,850
那個女人能織出預言 這是我們 瞧
This woman, she knits the future. That is us, look.

489
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,920
好吧 怎么只有四個人?
All right. How comes there's only four of us?

490
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,320
肯定漏了費恩
She had to miss Finn out, obviously.

491
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,380
那么小的人怎么織啊?
No-one can knit that fucking small, can they?

492
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,600
我們送他上床睡覺吧 手舉起來
Let's get him... Let's get him ready for bed. Hands in the air.

493
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,630

495
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,040
好了 衣服脫下來 准備好了嗎?

496
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:55,090
他去哪了 他去哪了?
Where's he gone? Where's he gone?

497
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,160
天啊 他去哪了? 在這兒呢
Oh, my God, where's he gone? There he is.

498
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,010
好了      給他講講巧克力的事
Right.       Oh, tell him about the chocolate.

499
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,170
什么巧克力?
What chocolate?

500
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,250
皮座椅 你去海邊的時候
The leather seats. You were going to the seaside.

Oh, shut up, man. No-one wants to hear about that. It's boring.

504
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,600
不 我就愛聽
No. I like it.

505
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,220
是焦糖夾心巧克力棒
It was a...a Curly Wurly.

506
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,580
我把它放在...短褲屁股兜里
And I put it in my back pocket of my... Of my shorts.

507
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:24,060
我坐在上面 從家里一直坐到公路上
And I sat on it all the way from home until the motorway.

508
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,330
那個假期可開心了
That were a bloody brilliant holiday!

509

我操 那坦克

00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:38,450
我最愛的坦克 過生日別人送的 對吧?
I got... I loved that tank. I got it for my birthday, didn't I?

513
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,340
媽媽和爸爸把海灘挖了個遍
Me mam and dad, they dug up the whole beach,

514
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,040
怎么也找不到
but they couldn't find it.

515
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,480
15年后 他們回去 回到原來的海灘 對吧?
15 years later, they went back, didn't they, to t'same beach?

516
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,300
他們吃著三明治
They were eating their sandwiches...

517

你要看電視嗎?
Do you want to watch TV?

521
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,860
好      好嗎?
Er...yeah.        Yeah?

522
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,200
就這么辦      好
Yeah, all right, then.        Good.

523
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,320
我去拿薯片好不好? 行
I'll get the crisps, shall I? All right?

524
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,710
諷刺的是 為了讓我拿走你的能力
The irony is that for me to take your power,

525
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:31,550
為了讓你從柜里出來
and for you to stop being trapped in closets,

526
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,890
我們得來次肛交

527
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,070
嗯
Mm.

528
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,160
事先說清楚 我和你上床是因為你不是基
Just so we're clear, am I fucking you because you're not gay

529
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,590
而且想移除你的超能力?
and you're just sick of having your power?

530
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,720
還是因為你就是基
Or am I fucking you because you are gay

531
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,760
卻不想被別人知道?
and you just don't want anyone to know about it?

532
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,560
有點難回答
It's a head-scratcher.

533
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,750
是因為我爸
It's my dad.

534
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,970
他不接受我
He won't accept me.

535
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,600
那他是個傻逼
Well, then, he's a dick.

536
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,090
有問題的是他 不是你
He's the one who needs helping, not you.

537
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,540
我該走了
I should go.

538
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,070
不想有空一起喝一杯?
I don't suppose you'd fancy a drink some time?

539
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,560
盡管交配已經結束
'And though their mating is now over,

540
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,320
雄性卻會開始審視其交媾行為
'the male will often begin to review his amorous...'

541
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,240
額 你在干什么?      沒什么
Eurgh. What you doing?        N-Nothing.

542
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,940
該死 對不起 我以為...是他的脖子
Shit. I'm sorry. I just thought... I thought it was his neck.

543
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,770
從皮毛中捉出虱子 于是...
'..picking fleas and tics out of his fur and so...'

544
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,290
好啦 你個二逼 快喝掉
Right, come on, you, buggerlugs, drink up.

545
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,750
"新居大改造"要開始了 快去看啊
Homes Under The Hammer's about to start. Let's have it.

546
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,220
來吧 可別錯過了 對不對?
Come on. We don't want to miss that, do we?

547
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,950
你干什么?      我覺得他心臟病犯了
What are you doing, man?        I think he's having a heart attack.

548
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,990
我們怎么辦? 操
What do we do? Fuck!

549
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,830
快來人啊
Somebody help!

550
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,100
快來人啊      吸氣
Somebody help!        Breathe!

551
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,260
上帝耶穌老天爺啊 怎么辦?
Jesus fucking Christ! What do we do?

552
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,190
退后
Stand back.

553
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,170
你是醫生嗎?      我是電工
Are you a doctor?        I'm an electrician.

554
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,020
他沒呼吸了
He's not fucking breathing!

555
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,310
清除
Clear!

556
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:20,990
哦操
Oh, shit.

557
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,290
你沒事吧 兄弟?
Are you all right, mate?

558
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,590
你沒事吧?
Are you all right?

559
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,210
你沒事吧?      他沒事
Are you all right?        He is.

560
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,210
沒關系 哥們 我在這 沒關系了
It's all right, man, I'm here now. It's all right, bud.

561
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,430
謝謝 謝謝你
Thanks. Thank you.

562
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,480
把他扶起來
Get him up.

563
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,280
費恩陪著他 他睡著了
Finn's with him. He's gone off to sleep.

564
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,920
他會死的 對嗎?
He's gonna die, isn't he?

565
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,030
不是... 不是現在
Not... Not now.

566
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,890
很快
Soon.

567
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,560
我會變成孤身一人
And I'm going to be all on my own.

568
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,040
等我變成這樣 誰來照顧我呢?
Who's going to look after me when I get like that?

569
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,780
也許你會遇見合適的人 成家 生子
Maybe you'll meet someone, settle down, have kids.

570
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,880
像普通人那樣
Like a normal person.

571
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,630
誰會樂意和我成家?
Who'd want to settle down with me?

572
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,270
嗯?
Hm?

573
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:43,200
我爺爺老了之后 我們給他找了個療養院
When my grandad got old, we found him a home.

574
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,090
他在那挺開心的
He was happy there.

575
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,760
也許這是他最好的歸宿
Maybe it's the best thing for him.

576
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,760
對大家都好
For everyone.

577
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,880
會有人照顧他 你想看他就去看
They'll look after him. You can visit him when you like.

578
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:01,850
對
Yeah.

579
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,980
你會跟我們一起去嗎?
Will you come with us?

580
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,770
我當然會
Of course I will.

581
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,800
我們只用給你弄台電視 几張海報
All we need t'do is get you a bloody TV. Couple of posters.

582
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,260
這可是單身公寓啊 瞧瞧 里外套間
It's a fucking bachelor pad. That's what this... Look at this. En suite.

583
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,230
還有撒尿的池子
Cheeky wee in the sink.

584
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,410
如果你凌晨四點想吃火腿鱷梨三明治
And if you fancy a ham and avocado sandwich at four in the morning,

585
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,290
還有客房服務 隨叫隨到
you got your room service there, cheeky tug.

586
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,290
他來了 他來看我了
He came. H-He came to see me.

587
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,470
喂 聽我說
Oi, listen to me.

588
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,100
我會來看你的
I'LL come and see you.

589
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,340
我會早也來 晚也來
I'm gonna be here so often,

590
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,600
直到你見我就想吐
you're gonna be sick of the friggin' sight of me.

591
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,210
我馬上就回來看你
I'll see you soon.

592
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,480
怎樣?
Yeah?

593
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,790
好嗎?
All right?

594
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,160
我們走吧 去新的地方
Let's just get away. We'll go somewhere.

595
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,210
從頭開始
Start again.

596
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,170
去哪?
Where?

597
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,980
我不知道 去哪都行
I don't know. Anywhere.

598
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,300
這里有我太多的回憶
There's too many memories for me here.

599
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,390
或者
Or...

600
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,610
不如我們
..how about

601
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,320
哪也不去
we don't go anywhere...

602
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,350
就去喝一杯?
and we just go for a drink instead?

603
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,440
我又去你的互助組了 什么也沒問出來
I went back to your group. No-one knows anything.

604
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,390
操 對不起 兄弟 我盡力了
Shit, I'm...I'm sorry, man. I tried.

605
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:17,920
可我后來又去了爸媽家
You know, but then I went to Mum and Dad's house

606
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,780
給你帶了個禮物
and I've got you a present.

607
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,260
怎樣?
Eh?

608
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,250
哦 對
Oh, yeah.

609
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,630
他們翻遍了整個海灘
They dug up the whole beach.

610
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,070
他們正吃著三明治...
They were having their sandwiches...

611
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:35,830
沒錯
They did.

612
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,540
你留著 好嗎?
I want you to have it, yeah?

613
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,550
你? 我沒想到你會來
You? I wasn't expecting to see you.

614
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,940
是嗎 為什么? 抱歉 為什么沒想到?
Really? Why? Sorry, why might that be?

615
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,470
強森先生不在這了 他走了
Mr Johnson isn't here any more. He's gone.

616
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:55,240
對不起 我... 我行事歷丟了
I'm sorry, I just...I seem to have mislaid the old Filofax.

617
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,420
你說的哪個強森先生?
Which Mr Johnson do you mean?

618
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,420
因為我常來看的有好几個 所以...
Cos I help a few on a regular basis, that's all, so...

619
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,140
倫﹒強森 我真的很擔心他
Len Johnson. I'm really worried about him.

620
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:08,170
我們查了所有醫院 就是找不到他
We've tried all the hospitals, but there's no sign of him.

621
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,480
謝謝
Thanks

622
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,080
(倫﹒強森)

623
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,820
沒事的
It's OK.

624
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,050
不用驚慌
There's no need to panic.

625
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,590
我們要在一起了
We're going to be together.

626
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,100
我和娜奧米
Me and Naomi.

627
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,300
我知道你會為我們高興的
I know you'd be happy for us.

628
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,190
可我不能冒險讓你毀了一切
But I can't risk you ruining everything.

629
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,730
你要把他怎樣?
What the fuck are you doing to him, man?

630
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,380
他是我的朋友
He's my friend.

631
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,580
我的超能力 可以和人互換年齡
My power. I can swap ages with people.

632
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,600
魯迪二號愿意每周和我互換一小時
Rudy 2 used to let me switch with him for an hour a week

633
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,910
讓我享受一下年輕的滋味
just to give me a break from being an old man.

634
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,910
我對她一見鐘情
I loved her from the minute I saw her.

635
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,710
娜奧米
Naomi.

636
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,930
我的護士
She was my nurse.

637
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,080
我終生沒結婚 我...
I never got married. I...

638
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,820
一直沒能找到真愛 直到今天
..never found my true love... until now.

639
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,060
如果我告訴她你的行為呢?
What if I was to tell her what you've been doing?

640
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,540
如果我給他看你的照片會怎樣?
What if I showed her the photo of you?

641
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,100
那時她就明白了 你是怎樣的人
Cos then she'd see you for what you really are.

642
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,820
求你別告訴她
Please don't tell her.

643
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,340
你還好吧 兄弟?
You all right, mate?

644
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,360
沒事了 兄弟
It's all right, mate.

645
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,680
沒事了 沒事了
It's all right, it's all right.

646
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,280
動手吧
Do it.

647
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,340
快動手 不然我就告訴她一切
Do it or I'll tell her everything.

648
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,900
握住他的手 好了
Take his hand. It's all right.

649
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,840

650
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,830

652
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,440
現在
Now then,

653
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:21,900
你得好好謝謝我了 年輕人 對不對?
I believe a thanks is in order, innit, young man? Ha-ha-ha!

654
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,330
你把我關壁櫥里了
You locked me in a cupboard.

655
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,420
那才不是壁櫥 那是儲藏室
No, it wasn't a cupboard, it was a storeroom,

656
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,980
我還給你擦屁股 喂你吃黃油糖
and I wiped your arse and I gave you butterscotch

657
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,950
還讓你看他媽的斯諾克
and I let you watch the friggin' snooker.

658
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,860
我不愛看斯諾克      忘恩負義的東西
I don't like the snooker.        You ungrateful fucker!

659
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,360
我開玩笑的 你做得挺好
Nah, I'm only kidding. You did great.

660
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:39,270
我走了 伙計 周五見
I'm going now, mate. See you on Friday.

661
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,740

Hey, come on. Give over, you soft shite.

快過來 歡迎回家
Come here, come on, welcome home.

663
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,120
所以 你幫我勾搭的那個基佬
So...about that gay guy that you hooked me up with.

664
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,100
哦對      對

我得說聲謝謝
I just wanted to say thanks.

666
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,290
幫助別人的感覺不錯
It felt good helping somebody.

667
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:10,200
你知道嗎 我覺得這就是我超能力的用法
You know, I think this is what I'm supposed to do with my power.

668
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,710
做個... 真正的英雄
You know, be like a... A proper hero.

669
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,670
都得謝謝你 嗯?
And all thanks to you, eh?

670
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,360
嗯 別客氣
Yeah, pleasure.

671
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,260
等等 現在你肯幫別人了 能不能...
So, hang on. Now you're into helping people, would you...?

672
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,190
不行 還是不操你的烏龜
No. I won't shag your tortoise.

673
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,870
早安 馬克 你睡得好嗎?
Morning, Mark. Did you sleep well?

674
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:45,610
回頭見
(See you later.)

675
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,920
你還好嗎?      嗯
You all right?        Mm.

676
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,740
我有點想他 是不是很奇怪?
Is it weird that I miss him?

677
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,970
照顧人的感覺挺好的
It was nice having someone to look after.

678
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,190
不 我不覺得奇怪
No, I don't think it's weird.

679
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,690
知道嗎? 如果我不是這么個混蛋 我會...
Do you know what? If I wasn't such a total fuck-up, I'd...

680
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,790
我大概會約你喝一杯 你會答應的
I'd probably ask you out for a drink and you'd say yeah

681
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:27,640
因為 我不會是你現在看到的這個混蛋
because, well, I wouldn't be the mess that stands before you now.

682
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,610
我會是...另一個人 你知道 一個...
I'd be... I'd be someone different, you know, someone...

683
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:33,820
一個好人
You know, someone good.

684
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:38,410
我們會在一起度過特別開心的時光
And we'd end up having this really amazing time together and...

685
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,510
也許... 也許還會變成男女朋友
I dunno, we might even end up as boyfriend and girlfriend.

686
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,620
也許最后 我也不會把一切搞成一團糟
And it wouldn't end up with me just fucking it up all the time

687
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:50,720
在你眼里變成個人渣
and you thinking I'm a total cunt.

688
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,850
絕對不會那樣的 結果會很圓滿
It wouldn't be like that at all. It'd be nice.

689
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,360
我們會幸福地... 在一起
And we'd be happy...together.

690
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,790
我不知道
And, I don't know, fucking hell,

691
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,530
沒准有一天 我們還會養個狗什么的
one day we might even get a dog or summat.

692
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,270
那好吧
All right, then.

693
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:15,830
什么好吧?
All right, then, what?

694
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,210
你剛請我喝一杯 我答應了
You just asked me out for a drink and I said yes.

695
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,000
好吧
Yeah.

696
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,390

Sam. Sam.

698
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:36,560
我想給你看點東西
I wanna show you something.

699
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,520
那是我嗎?
Is that me?

700
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,470
對 我覺得是
Yeah. I think so.

701
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,520
下面這個帶閃電的女孩
And this girl down here with the lightning bolts.

702
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,500
我犯了心臟病 被她救了
I had an heart attack. She saved my life.

703
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:57,410
樓頂上這個是誰?
Who's that on top of the building?

704
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,960
我不知道      也許是你
I don't know.        Maybe it's you.

705
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,120
說不定我們都能成為超級英雄?
What if we all become superheroes?

706
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,710
我是說 真正的...
I mean, like, you know, proper...

707
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,760
超級英雄
superheroes.

708
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:18,910
也許這才是我們的宿命
Maybe it's our destiny.
