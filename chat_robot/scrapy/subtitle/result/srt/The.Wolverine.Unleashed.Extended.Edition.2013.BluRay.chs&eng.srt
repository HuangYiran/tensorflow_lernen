00:01:01,718 --> 00:01:03,092
快看！在那儿！

4
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:04,982
有敌机！

5
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:07,380
在那儿！看啊！

6
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,677
报警！快准备！

7
00:01:10,705 --> 00:01:12,380
长崎将被袭击了！

8
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,336
快找掩体！

9
00:01:14,802 --> 00:01:15,410
快找掩体！

10
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,840
你们要去哪儿？
Where are you going?

11
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,291
救救我！
Help me!

12
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,965
在这儿！
Over here!

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,539
停下！别开枪！别开枪！

14
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,119
你！
You!

15
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,880
快走！
Go!

16
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,321
快走！
Go!

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,337
那是B29轰炸机，老弟
That was a b-29, bub.

18
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:34,527
这玩意儿来了跑也没用
There's no outrunning what's coming.

19
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,565
矢志田！

20
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,765
矢志田，你在干什么？！过来！

21
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,565
矢志田，过来啊！

22
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,170
想活命就下来躲着
You're better off down here.

23
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:46,800
- 矢志田！  - 是，我马上就来！

24
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,684
我要是你就抓紧时间
I'd hurry if I were you.

25
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,001
快跑！
Run. Now!

26
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,964
趴下！
Stay down!

27
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,807
不，等等！再等等！
No, wait! No, no. Wait.

28
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,326
不 外面不安全
No. It's not safe.

29
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,579
醒醒，醒醒，醒醒
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

30
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:08,170
醒醒
Wake up.

31
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,323
梦到什么了？
Where were you?

32
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,366
长崎
Nagasaki.

33
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,687
又是那事？
That far back?

34
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,681
你来啦
You're here.

35
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,921
是啊
Of course.

36
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,889
能留下来吗？
Can you stay?

37
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,645
你知道不行的
You know I can't.

38
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,802
珍，我很抱歉
Jean, I'm so sorry.

39
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,201
我明白
I know.

40
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,006
我再也不会伤害你或者其他人了
I'll never hurt you or anyone ever again.

41
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,491
我发誓
I made a vow.

42
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,044
郑重起誓吗？
A solemn vow?

43
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,402
你在嘲笑我
You're making fun of me.

44
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,482
太晚了
It's too late.

45
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,604
不！不，珍！
No! No, Jean!

46
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,205
不，不，不！求你了！
No, no, no! Please!

47
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,446
你躲不了的
You can't hide.

48
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,601
不，不，不！不要
No, no, no! Please!

49
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,961
你躲不了的！
You can't hide!

50
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,645
不，珍！不要！
No, Jean! No!

51
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,361
不
No.

52
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:56,689
（法洛五金店）

53
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,563
账都先赊着 谢谢啦，亲爱的
Whack all of that on store credit. Thanks, honey.

54
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,480
- 买箭了吗？   - 买了
- Got the arrows? - Yeah.

55
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,286
别忘了买箭
Remember the arrows?

56
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,250
好了，知道了，埃迪，买到了！
Yeah, yeah, Eddie, we got them!

57
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,650
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

58
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,370
兄弟，你差点打飞他的脚！
Man, you almost blew his foot off!

59
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,449
你不是猎人吧？
You're not a hunter, are you?

60
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,085
不再是了
Not anymore.

61
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,448
出了什么事？
What the hell?

62
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,930
别逼我这么做
Don't make me do this.

63
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,805
它绝对有近12英尺高
It must have been damn near 12 feet tall.

64
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,442
除了树枝被踩断的声音我们啥也没听见
We didn't hear nothing except twigs.

65
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,211
它就这样猛地冲了出来
Then it just came upon us.

66
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,753
它杀了赖利，内脏扯了一地
It got Riley, just gutted him.

67
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:54,370
还杀了埃迪
It got Eddie.

68
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,624
帐篷被撕得粉碎
Ripped through the tent,

69
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:59,006
雪地车像玩具一样被撞翻了
knocked over the snowcat like it was a toy.

70
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,928
你就是被灰熊袭击的那个人？
You the one was attacked by the grizzly?

71
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,761
我是唯一幸存下来的
I'm the one that survived.

72
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,565
我想请这位先生喝酒
I'd like to buy this man a drink.

73
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,361
你叫什么名字，先生？
What's your name, mister?

74
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,130
罗根
It's Logan.

75
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,114
这箭头抹了毒药
And that's a poison broadhead,

76
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:37,409
据我所知，这是非法的
which, last I heard, was illegal.

77
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,650
继续，问我是在哪儿找到的
Go ahead, ask me where I found it.

78
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,564
快点问我
Ask me.

79
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,320
你在哪儿找到的？
Where did you find it?

80
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,482
嗯，问得好
Well, funny you should ask.

81
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,802
是从一头灰熊身上拔出来来的
I pulled it out of the back of a grizzly.

82
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,484
不管是谁射的，都没有能力和胆量
Whoever shot it, didn't have the wind or the balls

83
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,005
正确追踪猎物…
to track the animal properly...

84
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,320
并且快速结束它的痛苦
And put it out of its misery.

85
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,483
相反你们却下毒…
Instead of dropping a lethal dose of the poison...

86
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,237
毒药渗进熊的体内
It bled into the bear,

87
00:12:23,237 --> 00:12:24,279
逼得它发疯
made him crazy,

88
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,565
丢了五条人命
killed five people.

89
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,410
我不知道你在说些什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

90
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,284
那是因为我从来不在箭上抹毒
Because I don't dip my arrows in anything.

91
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,527
既然这样，那也就没什么好怕的了
In that case, you got nothing to worry about.

92
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,601
见你的鬼
Damn.

93
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,290
这很疼啊
That hurt.

94
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,201
对不起了，珍
Sorry, Jean.

95
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,641
不用为他们操心
I wouldn't bother with them.

96
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,963
他们大多也是死路一条，不用你出手
Most of them will die soon anyway, without your help.

97
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,007
他们中的三个，一周内都会被同一辆车撞死
Three of them, a week from now in the same truck.

98
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,642
这把剑有几百年的历史了…
This sword is hundreds of years old...

99
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,202
被第一位使用它的武士命名为“谈山”
And was named Danzan by the first samurai who used it.

100
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,204
谈山在日文里的意思就是“分离器”
Danzan means "separator" in Japanese.

101
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,447
把脑袋和四肢从躯体上分离开的完美武器
The ideal weapon for separating head and limb from body.

102
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,204
就像这样
Like so.

103
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,601
我在后门等你
I'm parked in back.

104
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,730
上车
Get in.

105
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,721
对不起，车是租的
Sorry, it's a rental.

106
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,651
你是谁？
Who are you?

107
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,485
我？我叫雪绪
Me? I'm Yukio.

108
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,085
然后呢？
And?

109
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,807
我已经找了你一年多了
I've been trying to find you for over a year.

110
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,481
为什么？
Why?

111
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,682
为了给你这个
To give you that.

112
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,129
雇我的人想让你收下它
My employer wanted you to have it.

113
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,131
谁是你的雇主？
Who's your employer?

114
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,330
矢志田主人
Master Yashida.

115
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,389
他说这柄剑属于你
He said it belongs to you,

116
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,441
他要还债
and that he's paying all debts.

117
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,122
矢志田主人快死了
Master Yashida is dying.

118
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,940
他想向你道谢
He wants to say thank you

119
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,127
为了你多年前的救命之恩
for saving his life all those years ago.

120
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,729
他知道你是个…
He knows that you are a...

121
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,966
大忙人
Busy man.

122
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,647
但他很想亲自和你道别
But he very much wants to say his goodbye in person.

123
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,724
好吧，他在哪儿？
All right, where is he?

124
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,120
东京
Tokyo.

125
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,362
等等… 我可不去日本
Wait... I'm not going to Japan.

126
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,040
拒绝他的请求是很无礼的
It would be dishonorable for you to refuse his request.

127
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,360
那么，代我向矢志田先生道歉
Well, apologize to Mr. Yashida,

128
00:15:25,362 --> 00:15:27,330
我不会去东京的
I'm not going to Tokyo.

129
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,005
好吗？我还有很多事
All right? I've got things to do.

130
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,566
不必道歉
Do not apologize.

131
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,246
能见到金刚狼本尊已经很荣幸了
It's been an honor just to meet the Wolverine.

132
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,721
我已经不是从前的我了，明白吗？
That's not who I am anymore, you understand?

133
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,721
有意思
Interesting.

134
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,603
你干吗还跑到酒吧里去了
Why did you go into that bar,

135
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:45,680
不是为了寻求正义吗？
if not to seek justice?

136
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,881
- 我不知道   - 你不知道
- I don't know. - You don't know.

137
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,240
- 是的！ - 我觉得你知道
- No! - I think you know.

138
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,402
- 停车   - 你是个战士
- Pull over. - You are a soldier.

139
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,846
不，我不是 停车
No, I'm not. Pull over.

140
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,047
你就是个战士
You are a soldier.

141
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,849
赶紧停车！
Pull over, now!

142
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,320
快点
Now.

143
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,930
你是个战士
You are a soldier,

144
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,765
你所寻求的和其他战士是一样的
and you seek what all soldiers do.

145
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,087
什么呢？
And what's that?

146
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,762
光荣战死
An honorable death.

147
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,126
结束痛苦
An end to your pain.

148
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,449
谁说我很痛苦？
Who says I'm in pain?

149
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,770
一个人一辈子都在做同一个噩梦就是痛苦
A man who has nightmares every night of his life is in pain.

150
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,680

151
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,848
我和矢志田先生道别后就马上回来

152
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,650
没问题

153
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,609
要飞15个小时 还得取决于风向
Fifteen hours. Depending on the wind.

154
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,850
15个小时？
Fifteen hours?

155
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,360
你不喜欢坐飞机？
You don't like to fly?

156
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,445
很喜欢
I love it.

00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,286

158
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,566
Kuzuri.

159
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,481
Kuzuri.

160
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,483
Kuzuri 是什么意思？
Kuzuri. What does that mean?

161
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,925
怪兽

162
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,367

163
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,090

164
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,485
非常疼
Plenty of pain.

165
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,569
你几岁了？
How old are you?

166
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,363
反正活得够久了
It's been a long time.

167
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,091
经历了很多战争
Many wars.

168
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,291
明白吗？
Understand?

169
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,769
太多的战争了
Too many fuckin' wars.

170
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,965
快到了
We are almost there.

171
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,885
你能预知未来？
So, you can see the future?

172
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,968
我会看地图
I can read a map.

173
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,689
你说你知道酒吧里那些混蛋的下场
You said you knew the future of those assholes in the bar.

174
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,522
我知道他们会死

175
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,522
我们都会死
We are all going to die.

176
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,208
你说他们会在一周内被同一辆车撞死
You said they would die in the same truck, in a week.

177
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,882
如果你说中了，那可是个了不起的天赋
If you're right, that's quite a talent.

178
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,209
不是每个人都有钢爪的
We don't all have claws.

179
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,211
那么，我会死于空难吗？
So, do I die on this plane?

180
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,881
不会
No.

181
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,371
不是这架飞机
Not on this plane.

182
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,929
别被繁华的表象所迷惑
Don't let the lights fool you.

183
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,124
其实背后充满黑暗
These are dark days in Japan.

184
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,526
有人相信矢志田主人生病后
Some believe when master Yashida got sick,

185
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,761
有个黑影一直伴其左右
a shadow fell upon us.

186
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,924
你觉得他是神吗？
Do you think he's a God?

187
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,403
不 是个人
No. A man.

188
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,165
但很伟大

00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,450
战后，他参与了国家重建

190
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,206
家族产业也成了日本第一

191
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,483
他们给你纪念卡片了吗？

192
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,442
矢志田主人救了我的命
I owe master Yashida my life.

193
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,525
别得寸进尺
Don't be a dick.

194
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,086
戒备森严啊
A lot of guns.

195
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,685
这里发生了多起袭击事件

199
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,731
一个日本社团，黑帮
The Japanese mob, the Yakuza.

200
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,605
趁着政府萎靡不振他们日益强大
They've grown strong as the government has grown weak.

201
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,879
- 他身上有枪  - 他没问题

202
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,269
- 雪绪小姐，他带有枪  - 我说过了他没问题

203
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,845
我做过髋关节置换手术
Hip replacement.

204
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,359
请穿鞋

205
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,771
鞋太小了
Uh, too small.

206
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,805
太小了
Too small.

207
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,121
这边请
this way.

208
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,531
他是谁？
Who's that?

209
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,607
他叫信玄，矢志田主人的儿子
Shingen, master Yashida's son.

210
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,241
武艺不错
He's good.

211
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,761
一般吧
He's all right.

212
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,325
好久不见

213
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,445
穿靴子的坏蛋出了什么事？
So, what happened to the badass in boots?

214
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,762
矢志田主人非常传统
Master Yashida is traditional.

215
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,890
既着眼于过去又着眼于未来
One eye on the past and the other on the future.

216
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,838
必须死…

217
00:21:51,703 --> 00:21:55,093
对于抚养你是最合适的人选…

218
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,439
- 我不想做那种事情，爷爷…  - 只有你能做到…

219
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,922
那是真理子，她的孙女
That's Mariko, his granddaughter.

220
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,326
真理子

221
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,410
怎么了？发生什么事了？

222
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,041
最近也都没回我我邮件

223
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,285
现在不能告诉你

224
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,044
为什么？说清楚些啊

225
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,523
那个脏兮兮的人是谁？

226
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,811
他就是矢志田大人说要我找的人

227
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,167
给他收拾干净了再让他见爷爷

228
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,770
静和佐纪会为你沐浴

刮脸

230
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,370
想都别想
Like hell they are.

231
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,365
快进浴盆
Get in the tub.

232
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,242
给我进去
Get in the tub.

233
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,326
当真？
Really?

234
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,039
快坐好！快坐好！快坐好！

235
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,326
好了
All right.

236
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,192
- 别乱动啊！  - 怎么样？很舒服吧

237
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:31,000
就这么别动！

238
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,766
好吧 好吧
Okay. Okay.

239
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,473
行了，行了，行了
All right, all right, all right.

240
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:36,321
我自己能行
I can do that bit.

241
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,440
干嘛？
What?

242
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,726
干什么？
What?

243
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,885
你挺帅的
You look nice.

244
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,528
我觉着被侵犯了似的

为矢志田主人多准备两管抑制剂

矢志田大人

248
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,950
你找的人已到了

249
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,207
Kuzuri.

250
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,643
别来无恙啊

251
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,164
不过，这也不稀奇

我受够了这些预防措施

259

00:25:07,713 --> 00:25:10,362
我一直想感谢你的救命之恩

对别人也很好

268
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,321
我不仅仅是要感谢你，罗根

永生是个诅咒

他们对我的所作所为

284
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:57,046
是无法消除的

矢志田产业无所不能

你的自愈能力可以被转移

288
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,527
转移？
Passed?

289
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,205
转移到另一个人身上
From you to another.

290

你挣扎的够久了，罗根
You have struggled long enough, Logan.

291
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,441
我不明白
I'm confused.

292
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,241
我是来向一位故人道别的
I came here to say goodbye to a man I once knew.

293
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,129
我还是我

294
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,760
以前我没有准备好去死
I was not ready to die then.

295
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,446
现在也没有准备好
I am not ready to die now.

296
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,446
但你不是…
But you are...

297
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,444
对吗？
Aren't you?

298
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,682
- 你是要杀了我吗？   - 不
- Are you offering to kill me? - No.

299
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,763
不是马上
Not right away.

300
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,569
你能过上长寿平凡的日子
You can live a long and ordinary life.

301
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,806
恋爱，成家…
Fall in love, have a family...

302
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,883
变老
Grow old.

303
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,993
然后在某一天
And one day,

304
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:54,209
平凡离世
die an ordinary death.

305
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,050
这些都能做到
It can be done.

306
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,515
好吧，听我说
Yeah, look,

307
00:28:03,758 --> 00:28:04,630
很高兴再次见到你
nice to see you again.

308
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:05,604
我很抱歉你病了
Sorry you got sick.

309
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,809
求你了，罗根君 我需要你的帮助
Please, Logan-San. I need you again.

310
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,406
我担心我的家族
I fear for my family.

311
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,086
担心我所创造的一切
I fear for everything I have built.

312
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,402
- 够了 你该走了   - 求你了，罗根君
- Enough. You should leave. - Please, Logan-San.

313
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,005
她会被杀死的
They're going to kill her.

314
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,843
谁？
Who?

315
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,288
真理子，我的孙女
Mariko, my granddaughter.

316
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,172
她是我的宝贝
She is my treasure.

317
00:28:23,373 --> 00:28:25,281
她必须得到保护
She must be protected.

318
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,246
你不会想要我的能力的
You don't want what I've got.

319
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,241
Kuzuri.

320
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,846
Kuzuri!

321
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,930
信玄老爷，令尊有请

322
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,923
也是时候了

323
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,423
父亲！父亲，父亲…

324
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,693
在他和爷爷面谈之前

325
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,023
我有话要和父亲说

326
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,323
让开，让我进去

327
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,323
他一会儿会和你谈的，小姐

328
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,010
我现在就要见您！父亲！

329
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,964
现在不是时候，真理子！

330
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,464
- 求你了，父亲！  - 肃静！

331
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,364
等等，父亲 求你了，听我说

332
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,364
- 求你了，听我说，爸爸  - 别再烦我！

333
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,964
- 求你了，听我说  - 我现在没有时间

334
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,764
- 就因为爷爷选择了我…  - 我说过了，闭嘴！

335
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,264
你就是不在乎，所以爷爷才会…

336
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,050
真理子大小姐！

337
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,002
小心，小心 这里滑的很
Careful, careful. It's slippery out here.

338
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,361
放开我
Let go.

339
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,284
闹够了吗？
You about done?

340
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,688
放开我
Let go of me.

341
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,291
他就是想道个别，是吧？
He just wanted to say goodbye, huh?

342
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,405
你们俩一起长大的
You two grew up together.

343
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,201
是的
Yes.

344
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,569
但你不是她的亲妹妹
But you're not her sister.

345
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,046
是的
No.

346
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,571
矢志田主人在一次南方旅行中找到了我
Master Yashida found me on a trip to the South.

347
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,444
他带着真理子看在建的厂房
He brought Mariko to see a factory he was building.

348
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,008
当时我在垃圾堆里找吃的
I was digging through the garbage for something to eat.

349
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,610
所以他们就带你一起回家了？
So they just took you home with them?

350
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,322
交朋友对于真理子来说一向很难
It was always difficult for Mariko to make friends.

351
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,121
我去看看明早的飞机是否备妥
I'll see to it the plane is ready in the morning.

352
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,523
你就睡这儿
Sleep here.

353
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,244
别摆那么一张失望的脸啊，信玄

354
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,169
我还没死呢

355
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,206
需要我的话，我就在办公室
I'll be in my office if you need me.

356
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,167
说这些话不容易

357
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,964
但是，你我之间从来就没有过轻松的交流，不是吗？

358
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,288
我尽力吧，父亲

359
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,841
你已经尽力了

360
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,886
你一直以来就是我的第一继承人
You have always been my assumed successor.

361
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,201
所以过去的今年，为了培养你，
So the past few years, as a test,

362
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,248
我给予你更多的权力
I allowed you more control.

363
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,805
荣幸之至
It has been an honor.

364
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,089
但现在我意识到这是个错误
And I now realize that was a mistake.

365
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,767
你已经把公司带向了毁灭的边缘
You have brought this company close to ruin.

366
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,559
这些话我想应该重新…

367
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,422
我死后
When I die,

368
00:32:49,452 --> 00:32:52,724
会有别人接替我的主席一职
someone else will take my place as chairman.

369
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,165
父亲，如果我让您失望了，我很抱歉…
Father, I'm sorry if I have disappointed you...

370
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,242
我们就别再互相指责了
Let's not insult one another.

371
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,683
你不是那个领导矢志田的人
You are not the man to lead Yashida.

372
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,484
可您也不能一个外人来接管家族事业啊
You cannot bring in someone from the outside.

373
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,807
这个，你倒是说对了
In that, you are correct.

374
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,005
我绝不会让它发生的

375
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,890
永生就是个诅咒…
Eternity can be a curse...

376
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,040
Kuzuri.

377
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,602
你没有痛觉吗，Kuzuri？
You have no pain, Kuzuri?

378
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,801
你几岁了？
How old are you?

379
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,930
这个提议有点意思
Interesting offer.

380
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,451
为什么要拒绝呢？
What are you doing turning the old man down?

381
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,646
我以为你想要和我在一起
I thought you wanted to be with me.

382
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,087
过来
Come here.

383
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,881
他死了
He's dead.

384
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,282
我没能预见到
I didn't foresee it.

385
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,876
作为矢志田一郎最大的支持者和后盾，你对主人家有什么看法？

386
00:35:35,912 --> 00:35:37,068
这个不好说

387
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,726
真理子旁边的是谁？
Who's that? With Mariko.

388
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,370
他叫茂吕升
His name is Noburo Mori.

389
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,131
司法部长，前途无量
Minister of justice, a rising star.

390
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,886
他是真理子的未婚夫
He's Mariko's fiance.

391
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,042
你得鞠躬
You need to bow.

392
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,481
鞠躬
Bow.

393
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,089
信玄大人，这位是罗根先生
Lord Shingen, this is Mr. Logan.

394
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,083
我知道他是谁
I know who he is.

395
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,369
令尊是个好人
Your father was a good man.

396
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,207
他时常这样说起你
He would often say the same about you.

397
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,087
但是，他也总是痴迷于你这类人
But then, he was always fascinated with your kind.

398
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,600
告诉我，你凭什么认为
Tell me, why do you think

399
00:37:31,687 --> 00:37:34,329
他会派小雪绪来请你呢？
he sent our little Yukio to fetch you?

400
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,765
为了道别
To say goodbye.

401
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,602
那现在你已经道过了
And now you have.

402
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,840
该是你滚回老家的时候了
Time for you to go back to your cave.

403
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,967
还想让我见谁？
Anyone else you want me to meet?

404
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,323
我向您保证…

405
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,405
矢志田主人…

406
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,563
随时保持警惕…

407
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,683
用我的生命…

408
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,888
来保护真理子

409
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,087
这套铠甲属于Shiruba武士的…
That armor belonged to shiruba-samurai...

410
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,527
也就是银武士
The silver samurai.

411
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,127
他会生生世世守护在老人身边
It will stand watch over the old man forever.

412
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,485
罗根？
Logan?

413
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,089
有点不对劲儿
Something's not right.

414
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,330
放开我
Let go.

415
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,765
可以退到后面来吗？

416
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,846
请退回来！

417
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,523
退回来！

418
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:24,005
退后！

419
00:39:25,141 --> 00:39:25,869
退后！

420
00:39:27,544 --> 00:39:28,873
退后！

421
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,527
罗根！
Logan!

422
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,804
罗根！
Logan!

423
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,561
放开我！

424
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,321
罗根！
Logan!

425
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,684
你在拍什么呢！

426
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,723
老实点儿！

427
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,889
是那个外国佬！把他干掉！

428
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,961
Kuzuri.

429
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,570
走吧 快点，快走！
Let's go. Come on, let's go!

430
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,968
- 雪绪！   - 真理子！
- Yukio!        - Mariko!

431
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,041
你想去哪儿！

432
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,005
真理子！
Mariko!

433
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,529
那边儿！

434
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,370
快点 快走，快走
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

435
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,844
往这儿走！
Here, here! Here!

436
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,241
快走！
Move!

437
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,208
快进来！快！
In here! Move!

438
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,251
别想逃！死老外！

439
00:45:10,052 --> 00:45:11,174
你跑不了啦！

440
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,485
继续走，不要停
Keep moving, keep moving.

441
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,770
走！
Move!

442
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,444
你在流血 需要包扎
You're bleeding. You need help.

443
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,125
先走吧
Just keep moving.

444
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,123
感谢你的帮助
Thank you for what you did back there.

445
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,884
- 那些人是黑帮的   - 我没事了
- Those were Yakuza. - I'm fine.

446
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,724
他们为什么跟踪你？
Why are they after you?

447
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,406
没事了 我一个人能离开这儿
I'm fine. I can make my way from here.

448
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,524
你也该走了
You should go.

449
00:45:52,737 --> 00:45:55,207
去找个医生治伤
Get yourself a doctor.

450
00:45:58,629 --> 00:46:00,945
（上野车站）

451
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,001
真舒服
That's nice.

452
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,568
这就是子弹头列车，对吗？
This is one of those bullet trains, right?

453
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,563
我说过了不需要你的帮助
I told you I don't need your help.

454
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,963
他们能跑多快，300英里时速？
So what do they do, like, 300 Miles an hour?

455
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,119
走这边，请上车吧

456
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,929
这次无耻的攻击事件…

457
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,857
是由黑帮暴徒一手策划的

458
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:19,288
针对我有效摧毁有组织犯罪行为的暴力回应

459
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,731
他们从北门跑了

460
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,770
她当时和那个陌生人在一起…

461
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,887
你那个外国朋友，是哪儿来的？
Your gaijin friend, where is he?

462
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,562
据我所见，他一直在保护您的女儿啊
Last I saw, he was protecting your daughter.

463
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,649
你只是个玩具娃娃
You are a toy doll.

464
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,963
一个孩子的玩伴，长大后就抛弃你
A companion for a child who has outgrown you.

465
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,327
记住这点
Keep that in mind.

466
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,529
哈优，没事吧？

467
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,841
那么，我们这是要去哪儿，真理子？
So, where are we headed, Mariko?

468
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,521
我们要去哪儿？
Where are we going?

469
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,481
我坐到终点站
I'm going to the end of the line.

470
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,881
我的家族在南方有个老宅子
My family has a home in the South.

471
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,680
愚蠢
That's stupid.

472
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,291
恕我冒犯
No offense,

473
00:48:19,366 --> 00:48:21,284
但是他们肯定知道去那里找你的
but they're gonna know to look for you there.

474
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,443
总比这儿强
Not this place.

475
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,801
- 你想一个人去   - 是的
- You want to be left alone. - Yes.

476
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,041
- 我理解   - 是吗？
- I understand. - Do you?

477
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,610
是的 相信我
Oh, yeah. Trust me.

478
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,881
问题是，如果我不跟着你…
Problem is, if I do that...

479
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,321
恐怕你活不过今晚
I don't think you're gonna live to see the end of the day.

480
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,882
你不能假装什么事都没发生过
You can't pretend shit isn't happening when it is,

481
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:39,441
公主阁下
princess.

482
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,953
除非你想死
Unless you want to die.

483
00:48:40,953 --> 00:48:43,361
否则，你就得加倍小心
In that case, you're playing this perfectly.

484
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,164
这是怎么了？
what the hell?

485
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,684
发生了什么事？
What the hell is happening?

486
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,170
是那个老外！

487
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,121
你怎么了？
What happened to you?

488
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,924
我们得离开这儿 快走
We get off here. Let's go.

489
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,721
听我说，好吗？
Just listen to me, will you?

490
00:52:24,721 --> 00:52:25,920
我们得去找个安全的地方
We need to find someplace safe.

491
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,020
我不明白
I don't understand.

492
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,770
你怎么知道他们是黑帮的？
How do you know they were Yakuza?

493
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,481
他们和那些僧侣是一伙儿的
They were the same guys from the temple.

494
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,881
你怎么知道他们跟踪我？
How do you know they were after me?

495
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,161
我们得先找个安全的地方
Look, we need to find someplace safe.

496
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,287
我们不能暴露
We need to get off the streets.

497
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,329
- 我不明白   - 闭嘴！听着
- I don't understand. - Shut up! Listen.

498
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,926
你熟悉这里吗？市中心在哪儿？
Do you know this place? Where's downtown?

499
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,605
直走
Straight ahead.

500
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,122
闹市区在哪儿？
So, where's the nice part of town?

501
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,611
往前再走八个街区
Another eight blocks that way.

502
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,808
很好 我们就躲在这儿
Good. We're staying here.

503
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,810
走吧
Let's go.

504
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,808
这是情侣主题客栈
This is a love hotel.

505
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,325
什么客栈？
A what?

506
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,005
情侣主题客栈
A love hotel.

507
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,011
专供情侣住的，明白吗？
For couples, understand?

508
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,489
好吧
Right.

509
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,624
要两间房
uh, two rooms.

510
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,850
要同一楼层，相邻的两间房
Adjoining rooms, on the same floor.

511
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,327
两隔壁的 紧挨着的
Right next to each other. Very close.

512
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,889
要同一层的 同一层
Same floor. Same floor.

513
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,912
我们需要两间房间

514
00:53:31,365 --> 00:53:33,490
有没有挨着的两间吗？

515
00:53:34,168 --> 00:53:35,327
现在客人很多啊

516
00:53:36,139 --> 00:53:37,241
现在空着的房间啊…

517
00:53:38,956 --> 00:53:40,296
地牢特色房

518
00:53:41,214 --> 00:53:42,571
护士特色房

519
00:53:43,097 --> 00:53:44,823
火星探险房

520
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,121
她说什么来着？
What did she say?

521
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,209
她说没有紧挨着的房间了
She has no rooms available next to each other.

522
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,342
她在问我们是不是更喜欢
She's asking if we prefer

523
00:53:52,342 --> 00:53:55,241
“地牢房”，“护士房”…
"the dungeon", "the nurse's office..."

524
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,691
或者“火星探险房”
Or the "mission to Mars."

525
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,205
这间不错
This'll do.

526
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,447
发射！我们要发射啦！
Liftoff! We have a liftoff!

527
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,762
老实说，挺温馨的
Kind of homey, actually.

528
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,770
打算怎么睡？
Where do you plan on sleeping?

529
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,322
不知道
I don't.

530
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,245
你流了很多血
That's a lot of blood.

531
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,804
我想英雄已经救美了
I thought you were done being the hero.

532
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,444
但是那些家伙… 会杀了她的
But these guys were... Trying to kill her.

533
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,248
别管了
Just let it go.

534
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,370
死其实不难
It's not hard to die.

535
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,003
跟我来吧
Come to me.

536
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,281
罗根…
Logan...

537
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,241
小心地滑
You're slipping.

538
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,088
站住，混蛋！别跑！

539
00:56:16,482 --> 00:56:18,467
你是什么东西！

540
00:56:23,543 --> 00:56:25,913
干掉他！快点！

541
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,641
罗根…
Logan...

542
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,560
快杀了他！

543
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,690
有什么临终遗言吗，外国佬？
Wanna say something before you die, gaijin?

544
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,289
怎么回事？谁啊？

545
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,888
不行！

546
00:57:39,718 --> 00:57:43,577
- 让我来  - 不行 我不放心，不行

547
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,641
他醒过来了

548
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,399
这是老板娘美惠子
This is Mieko from the hotel

549
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:12,562
和他的孙子，仁志
and her grandson, Hitoshi.

550
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,324
他是医生吗？
Is he a doctor?

551
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,161
某种意义上说，是的
In a manner of speaking, yes.

552
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,727
他是名兽医…
He's a veterinarian...

553
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,484

Thanks.

556
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,611
你把他割伤了一两次
You may have cut him once or twice

557
00:58:36,611 --> 00:58:38,410
在他为你缝合的时候
while he was stitching you.

558
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,564
好吧，不用谢，没关系
Okay, okay, okay.

559
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,735
我来收拾就行了

560
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:45,708
你们去休息一会儿吧

561
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,404
谢谢你
thank you.

562
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,801
我从来都不需要这些的
I never needed this before.

563
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,281
什么？治疗吗？
What? Help?

564
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,394
那个医生，治疗你爷爷的
That doctor, the one who helped your grandfather,

565
00:59:13,394 --> 00:59:14,080
一头金发的
the blonde.

566
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,287
她是谁？
Who is she?

567
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,967
她是去年爷爷在美国接受治疗时认识的
He met her last year when he was in America for treatment.

568
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,923
你爷爷说我的自愈能力能被移除
Your grandfather told me my healing could be taken from me,

569
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,081
并转移
passed on.

570
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,360
我不如以前恢复的快了
I'm not getting better, not like before.

571
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,490
肯定是她捣的鬼
She did this to me.

572
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,801
美女！
Blondie!

573
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,039
那个金发美女，你等一下啊

574
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:45,709
美女！
Blondie!

575
00:59:45,817 --> 00:59:48,762
等下，等下，等下 好正点啊

576
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,849
多少钱？多少钱，懂吗？多少钱过夜？
How much? How much, yeah? How much?

577
01:00:00,317 --> 01:00:01,356
他没事儿吧？

578
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,051
你让我等了两小时
You kept me waiting two hours.

579
01:00:16,051 --> 01:00:17,323
你太无礼了
You have no respect.

580
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,050
你没找着他们吧？
So you haven't found them?

581
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,241
别耍我，贱人 我会杀了你的
Don't play with me, bitch. I could kill you.

582
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,523
如果你杀了我
If you could make me feel something,

583
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,246
原田，那可就太高尚了
Harada, that would be sublime.

584
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,164
我会撕烂你的嘴
I can slit your pretty mouth open,

585
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,322
再敢说我是笨蛋的话…
before you open it to say one more stupid...

586
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,570
我只要求你做一件事，小家伙
I asked you to do one thing, little man.

587
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,524
把那个变异人带来
Bring me the mutant.

588
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,570
我不是你的手下 我受雇于…
I don't work for you. I work for the house of...

589
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,605
你为矢志田家族服务，这我知道
You work for Yashida, I get it.

590
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,529
但你并没有完成他的遗愿
Yet you cannot fulfill his dying wish.

591
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,568
天哪，知道你辜负了他多少心血吗
My God, if you had any idea how much you have failed him.

592
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,042
罗根在哪儿？我和他没完
Where is Logan? Lam not done with him.

593
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,803
那个变异人很强大
The mutant has powers.

594
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,861
现在只是个凡人罢了
He's just a man now.

595
01:01:14,095 --> 01:01:16,040
他现在很虚弱
His flesh is weak now.

596
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,925
我的杰作
I did that.

597
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,731
我抑制了他的能力，他可以被打败
I suppressed his power so he could be taken.

598
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,123
知道了吧，现在对我客气点儿
You see, it's me you should respect.

599
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,201
赶在黑帮之前找到他们
Just find them, before the Yakuza.

600
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,888
我们在这里下车
We get off here.

601
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,809
我们在哪儿？
Where are we?

602
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,529
长崎外的某个地方
Just outside Nagasaki.

603
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,091
往这儿走
This way.

604
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,607
这不是出现在葬礼上的家伙嘛，那个弓箭手
This is the guy from the funeral, the archer.

605
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,923
他是你的前男友
He was your boyfriend.

606
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,162
他叫原田
That's Harada.

607
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,323
我们是那年夏天的小镇冠军
We were village champions that summer.

608
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,405
他是箭术冠军，而我是刀术冠军
He with the bow and me with the knives.

609
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,646
原田和我本打算结婚
Harada and I were planning to get married.

610
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,370
是谁阻止了你们？
What stopped you?

611
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,846
我爷爷
Grandfather.

612
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,685
他说至少要等到我们15岁之后
He said we had to wait until we were at least 15.

613
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,204
这是山货，这是海货
From the Mountain, from the sea.

614
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,522
- 我开吃了！  - 我开吃了！

615
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,044
筷子插在饭上是很不吉利的
Chopsticks upright are a bad omen.

616
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,048
就像葬礼上焚香一样
It resembles incense at a funeral.

617
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,046
世间万事都是有寓意的
Nothing is without meaning.

618
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,124
那么，那天晚上
So, the other night at the house,

619
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,601
你冲入雨幕…
when you ran out in the rain...

620
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,922
是什么寓意呢？
What did that mean?

621
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,688
我爷爷快死了
My grandfather was dying.

622
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,324
你知道他快死了
You knew he was gonna die.

623
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,640
他卧病在床多年
He'd been sick for a long time.

624
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,206
我怕的不是他的死
It wasn't his death I feared.

625
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,603
那你怕的是什么？
So, what, then?

626
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,769
那天晚上他和你说了些什么？
What did he tell you that night?

627
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,681
真理子，为什么你的父亲会打你？
Mariko, why did your father hit you?

628
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,285
我在试图警告他
I was trying to warn him.

629
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,090
警告什么？
About what?

630
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,927
你爷爷和你说了些什么？
What did your grandfather tell you?

631
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:42,249
他跟我说…
He told me that...

632
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,801
三天之内，宣读遗嘱的时候…
In three days, when they read his will...

633
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:55,444
我会成为全日本最有权势的人
I will become the most powerful person in Japan.

634
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,084
他把一切都给了我
He gave it all to me.

635
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:02,881
矢志田企业？
The company?

636
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,122
可我不想要
I didn't want it.

637
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,288
他早就料到
He knew that.

638
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,245
我就是不明白他为什么要给我
I don't understand why he gave it to me.

639
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,001
这一切都是我父亲日思夜想的
It was all my father dreamed of.

640
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,009
我想，这就是关键吧
Well, that's why.

641
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,641
你的未婚夫呢？毛驴
What about this fiance of yours? Nostromo.

642
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,806
茂吕
Noburo.

643
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,644
他知道这事吗？
Does he know about this?

644
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,131
不知道
No.

645
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,329
你为什么要嫁给他？
Why are you marrying him?

646
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,762
他就是个混球啊
He seems like kind of an asshole.

647
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,007
这是我父亲去年安排的
My father arranged it last year.

648
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,481
什么？
What?

649
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,883
我们的婚姻能在政坛上助他一臂之力
It gives him a better access to the political theater.

650
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,608
违背我父亲的意愿就是让他蒙羞
To disobey my father would be to dishonor him.

651
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,926
我不指望你能理解
I don't expect you to understand.

652
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,961
毕竟你不是日本人
You're not Japanese.

653
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,013
我们的国土又长又窄

654
01:06:18,036 --> 01:06:21,842
就连火车都只能跑两个方向

655
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,851
我向您保证，信玄阁下…

656
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,883
我的人正在尽全力…

657
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,003
你们都是一群废物

658
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,088
你已经浪费了我太多的时间

659
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,048
我还要料理家父的后事

660
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,085
赶紧滚去找她！

661
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,043
告诉我你从内部带来的好消息吧
Tell me you have more promising news from your contacts.

662
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,808
遗嘱三天之内就要公布了
They open the will in three days.

663
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,044
我们快没时间了
We are running out of time.

664
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,117
快了
Soon,

665
01:06:53,397 --> 01:06:54,562
我希望是
I hope.

666
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,889
我派了人去南方
I'm sending men to the South.

667
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,042
就是我们发现尸体的地方
That's where we found the bodies.

668
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,889
如果黑帮混入了葬礼队伍…

669
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,491
那他们肯定安插了内线

670
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,161
他们绝对找不到我的

671
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,005
你现在不安全

672
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,925
我来找你

673
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,526
他们会跟踪你的

674
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,080
拜托了

675
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,766
再等几天吧

676
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,286
求你了 我没事

677
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,171
罗根在这

678
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,442
真理子，他受伤了

679
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,045
真理子小姐

680
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,321
有人来了

681
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,083
真理子？
Mariko?

682
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:37,968
不说了

683
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,401
真理子？
Mariko?

684
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,364
- 真理子小姐  - 奶奶

685
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:45,411
真理子小姐，有一树倒在了路边

686
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,604
那个男人能帮上忙

687
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,288
- 茶好了  - 辛苦您了

688
01:07:55,045 --> 01:07:57,011
茶有点儿热，您小心点儿

689
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,530
你还好吧？
Are you okay?

690
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,287
我累了
Tired.

691
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,524
你需要点什么吗？
Do you need something?

692
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,721
不
No.

693
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,356
- 你好啊  - 你好

694
01:08:37,852 --> 01:08:39,532
- 我来个苹果？  - 苹果啊

695
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,966
这个能帮到你
This will help.

696
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,250
是时候了
It's time.

697
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,121
什么？
What?

698
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,891
求你了 收下吧
Please. Take it.

699
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,925
谢谢
Thank you.

700
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,611
不
No.

701
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,810
要握双手
Two hands.

702
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:14,080
日本的剑要双手握紧
Japanese sword require two hands.

703
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,042
- 像这样？  - 没错
- Like that? - That's it.

704
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,648
真是漂亮，矢志田
It's beautiful, Yashida.

705
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,766
但是我不能收下
But I can't take it.

706
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,566
求你
Please.

707
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,926
谢谢
Thank you.

708
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,521
妥善保管
Keep it safe.

709
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,329
给我妥善保管
Keep it safe for me.

710
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,491
终有一天，我会来取
Someday, I'll come get it.

711
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,003
是时候了
It's time.

712
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:51,361
事发之时，我在现场
I was here when it happened.

713
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,241
我就是这样认识你的爷爷
It's how I met your grandfather.

714
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,682
我们躲在这里
We hid in there.

715
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,725
我听过你们的故事
I heard the stories.

716
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,050
我的爷爷会说…
My grandfather would say...

717
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,510
这里发生的事见证着
What happened here was proof

718
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:11,363
世界和平的出现
that everything in the world finds peace.

719
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,082
到最后
Eventually.

720
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,886
人类终能踏上复兴之路
That man can recover from anything.

721
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,486
或许你也一样
Maybe you, too.

722
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,562
你睡得不怎么好
You don't sleep very well.

723
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,722
夜里传来你的呼叫
You call out in the night.

724
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,606
谁是珍？
Who's Jean?

725
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,009
我们该回去了
We should go back.

726
01:13:06,592 --> 01:13:07,371
大雨将至
There's rain coming.

727
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:29,645
我来烧茶
I'll make tea.

728
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,131
给你
For you.

729
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,570
这样不对
This isn't right.

730
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,488
你要系得像个真正的武士
You need this tied like a proper samurai.

731
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,642
你的爷爷称我为浪人
Your grandfather called me a ronin.

732
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,401
意思是没有主人的武士
A samurai without a master.

733
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,443
他说我命中注定长生不老…
He said I was destined to live forever...

734
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,006
没有意义地活下去
With no reason to live.

735
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,485
他说得对吗？
Was he right?

736
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,091
对
Yes.

737
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,969
现在还是？
Still?

738
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,730
你在干什么？
what are you doing?

739
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,800
不会有好的结果
This isn't going to end well.

740
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,202
你爱上的人都要死去
Everyone you love dies.

741
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,882
Kuzuri.

742
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,684
你知道什么意思吗？
Do you know what that means?

743
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,203
一种动物
An animal.

744
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:52,605
拥有长爪利牙的凶猛野兽
A fierce creature with long claws and sharp teeth.

745
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,728
它无所畏惧
It fears nothing.

746
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,596
我还是个女孩的时候
When I was a girl,

747
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:02,570
我做过恶梦
I had nightmares.

748
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,641
我醒来，然后奔向父母
I'd wake up and run to my parents.

749
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,285
我的父亲会发怒
My father would get angry.

750
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,429
别害怕，回到床上去

751
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:16,803
“回到梦中 面对你的恐惧”
"Go back to sleep. Face your fears."

752
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,766
我的爷爷则不同
My grandfather was different.

753
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,021
他告诉我关于Kuzuri的故事
He told me stories about Kuzuri,

754
01:17:24,544 --> 01:17:25,486
他的朋友
his friend.

755
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,449
就是他在井底认识的那个人
Who he met at the bottom of a well.

756
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,581
他说Kuzuri是天神下凡
He said the Kuzuri was magical

757
01:17:34,367 --> 01:17:36,088
守护他的生命
and saved his life.

758
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,781
他又说Kuzuri会守护我
He said Kuzuri would protect me, too,

759
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:43,770
在我入睡以后
as I slept in my bed.

760
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,530
谁是珍？
Who's Jean?

761
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,685
她喜欢你吗？
Is she like you?

762
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,442
她发生什么事了？
What happened to her?

763
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,649
她死了
She died.

764
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,124
我杀了她
I killed her.

765
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,723
还有Kuzuri
Along with the Kuzuri.

766
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,400
罗根
Logan.

767
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,683
真理子？
Mariko?

768
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,002
罗根！
Logan!

769
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,211
罗根！
Logan!

770
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:35,841
真理子？
Mariko?

771
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,726
真理子！
Mariko!

772
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,443
不要！罗根！
No! Logan!

773
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,361
不要！
No!

774
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:49,282
罗根！
Logan!

775
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:50,967
不要！
No!

776
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:03,802
真理子！
Mariko!

777
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,601
罗根！
Logan!

778
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,401
不要！
No!

779
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:14,721
罗根！
Logan!

780
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,564
真理子！真理子！
Mariko! Mariko!

781
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,245
罗根！
Logan!

782
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,920
他们把她带到什么地方？
Where are they taking her?

783
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,804
他们把她带到什么地方？
Where are they taking her?

784
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,450
说话啊，废物？
Where, you piece of shit?

785
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,931
我不会说的，外国佬
I no talk, gaijin.

786
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,489
我不会说的
I never talk.

787
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,127
雇佣你的是谁？
Who hired you?

788
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,964
带我去找森信郎
Take me to Noburo.

789
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,643
罗根… 带我去找他
Logan... Take me to him.

790
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,800
我必须要告诉你一件事
I need to tell you something.

791
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,883
开车 快
Do it. Now.

792
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,083
你留在车里
You wait in the car.

793
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,562
- 罗根  - 什么？
- Logan. - What?

794
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,323
我预见到你的死
I saw you die.

795
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,005
什么？
What?

796
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,244
我预见到你的死
I saw you die.

797
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,682
什么时候？就刚才？
When? Just now?

798
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,849
不久前
Awhile ago.

799
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,890
但是我又看不到完整的画面
But it's not like I get a complete picture.

800
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,327
更像是管中窥豹
More like looking through a keyhole.

801
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:16,121
但是我的预感没有错过
But I'm always right.

802
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,368
我只能看到一个人一生的一小部分…
All I can see is one part of a person's life...

803
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,530
和他们的死亡
Their death.

804
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,481
如今，我看到你的
And I saw yours.

805
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,563
那么，你看到什么？
So, what did you see?

806
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,157
我看到你的背影
I see you on your back.

807
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:35,364
周围血迹斑斑
There's blood everywhere.

808
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,409
你手里捧着你的心脏
You're holding your own heart in your hand.

809
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,528
它停止了跳动
It's not beating.

810
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,560
我没有时间听你的鬼话
I don't have time for this shit.

811
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,153
我五岁的时候
When I was five,

812
01:22:48,153 --> 01:22:50,766
就预见到父母的死
I knew how my own parents would die.

813
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:56,607
然后，我就在后座目睹死亡的发生
Then I watched it happen from the back seat.

814
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:00,721
看着我
Look at me.

815
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,676
许多人都要我的命
A lot of people have tried to kill me,

816
01:23:05,676 --> 01:23:06,571
但是我还在这
and I'm still here.

817
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:11,366
但是你如今不同了
But you're different now, aren't you?

818
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,043
他们能伤害你
They can hurt you.

819
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,202
他们能杀死你
They can kill you.

820
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,362
你乖乖留在车上
Just wait in the car.

821
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,202
- 我说，留在车上  - 你需要支援
- I said, wait in the car. - You need backup.

822
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,243
你目前的状态，你并不安全
You're not safe, not in your condition.

823
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,601
就当我是你的随身保镖
Just think of me as your bodyguard.

824
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,409
性感啊
Sexy.

825
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,408
来吧！我要上了
Come on! I'm coming.

826
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,171
等我一下哟

827
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,929
第四轮 我们一饮而尽
Okay, round four. Here we go.

828
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,565
屁股不错嘛

829
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,485
女士们，干杯
Drink for you, my lady.

830
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,561
出去
Get out.

831
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,924
不是说你
Not you.

832
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,001
说我过时也好…
Call me old-fashioned...

833
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,730
但是我认为订婚以后
But I thought being engaged meant

834
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,006
你就别乱搞
you were done with this kind of bullshit.

835
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,571
我是法务大臣
I am the minister of justice.

836
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:48,926
你知道我能怎样整死你吗？
Do you have any idea what I could do to you?

837
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,969
真的？你以为穿个红色内裤
Really? You're gonna try and talk tough,

838
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,849
就能装成硬汉要挟我吗？
standing there in your red underwear?

839
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:54,446
我让你再说十个字…
You have ten words...

840
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,967
只有十个字…
Ten words...

841
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:01,483
跟我解释一下，为什么你一个法务大臣…
To explain to me why you, the minister of justice...

842
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:04,484
要让你的未婚妻死于矢志田一族刀下？
Would want your fiance killed by the Yakuza.

843
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,170
如果我不满意你的答案
And if I don't like what you say,

844
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:08,846
我就把你扔出这个窗外
you are going through that fucking window.

845
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,802
你压根就不知道将要…
You don't have the faintest idea what's going on...

846
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,568
- 他说了多少个字了？  - 九个
- How many words was that? - Nine.

847
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:19,371
九个 你还有一个字剩下
Nine. You have one word left.

848
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:23,043
玩真的？
Really?

849
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,810
玩真的？
Really?

850
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,645
信玄 信玄！

851
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:29,801
继续说
Keep going.

852
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,291
自从他病了后…
Since he got sick...

853
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:36,962
矢志田老头子花费数亿元看病、治疗
Old man Yashida spent billions on doctors, healers.

854
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,885
在他北方的研究所大量贮备艾德曼合金…
Stockpiling adamantium at his lab in the north...

855
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,441
秘密研究延长寿命的方法
Secretly trying to prolong his life.

856
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,729
他把公司推向破产的边缘
He brought the company to the edge of bankruptcy.

857
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:48,042
他对你入了迷
He was obsessed with you.

858
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,245
东武的干部们全都…

859
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:51,926
说人话！
English!

860
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,484
信玄撒谎了，为了保护这个老头…
Shingen lied, protected the old man...

861
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:58,849
对股东和董事会隐瞒了巨债
Concealed the debt from stockholders and the board.

862
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,401
他要成为个好孩子，以为自己会得到奖赏
He tried to be a good son and thought he'd be rewarded.

863
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,761
结果老头把所有都留给了孙女
And then the old man left everything to his granddaughter.

864
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,326
如果真理子掌控大权，她会甩掉他
If Mariko got all that power, she would dump his ass.

865
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:08,447
说得没错
It's true.

866
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,689
真理子绝对不会完成这场婚姻…
Mariko would have never gone through with the wedding...

867
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,320
只要遗嘱公诸于世
Not once the will was revealed.

868
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,246
她从来都不管我
She never took to me.

869
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:19,524
真的吗？你真是正人君子
Oh, really? A class act like you.

870
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,845
信玄答应事成给我一笔钱
Shingen promised me a fortune for my help.

871
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,607
所以你要追杀他的女儿 是这样吗？
So, you put a hit on his daughter. Is that it?

872
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,682
官场沉浮谁能主宰
Political careers don't last forever.

873
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:32,367
没错
That's right.

874
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:34,523
等下！等下！不！
Wait! Wait! No!

875
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:37,445
你要真相 我给了你真相！
You wanted the truth. I told you the truth!

876
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,169
我不喜欢
I didn't like it.

877
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:45,451
你怎么知道下面有个泳池？
How did you know there's a pool down there?

878
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,011
我不知道的
I didn't.

879
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:07,689
你知道我在大学修读的是生物学？

880
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,005
遗传学

881
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:17,486
有许多基因跳过了遗传

882
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,764
隐性基因

883
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,359
眼睛

884
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,486
眼睛 毛发

885
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,166
才能

886
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,050
性格

887
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:35,408
每个孩子获得了不同的基因

888
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:38,322
我的父亲在我身上看不到自己的影子

889
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:41,005
但在你的身上…

890
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,767
他好像看着块镜子一样

891
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,850
你是如何说服我的父亲…

892
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,490
让你来掌控…

893
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,125
全亚洲最大型的企业？

894
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,045
你疯了

895
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,329
我只是在觉醒

896
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:16,650
如果你杀了我，你会失去…

897
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,769
仅存不多的荣誉

898
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,681
真理子，别害怕

899
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:26,327
我不是要伤害你

900
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:27,806
我想要帮助你

901
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,690
帮你解除你的痛苦…

902
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,160
让你重做上周…

903
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,646
那个变种人阻止你做的事

904
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:35,081
我从没想过要死，父亲

905
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:48,491
放开我

906
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,886
没事了，真理子

907
01:28:59,080 --> 01:28:59,842
跟我走

908
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:00,847
发生什么事？！

909
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,327
超出你所想象的

910
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,284
是你
You.

911
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,170
是我
Me.

912
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:19,041
打扰你们不好意思，不过我要你女儿的活着
Sorry to interrupt, but I need your daughter alive.

913
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,531
你究竟是谁？
What are you?

914
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,761
化学家，虚无主义者…
A chemist, a nihilist...

915
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:27,647
资本家，变种人
A capitalist, a mutation.

916
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:32,765
我是毒蛇
A viper.

917
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,809
守卫都上哪去了？
Where is the security?

918
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:25,841
矢志田的人
Yakuza.

919
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,481
信玄？
Shingen?

920
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,366
罗根？
Logan.

921
01:30:55,212 --> 01:30:58,322
（来找她）

922
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,570
这里 看这
This. This here.

923
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,324
这是哪里？
Where is this?

924
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,568
矢志田主人出生的地方
Master Yashida's birthplace.

925
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:14,410
公司在山中的一个建筑
The company built a facility into the mountainside.

926
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:19,406
有多远？
How far?

927
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,646
离这里500公里
500 kilometers from here.

928
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,881
我要把这个东西弄出体外
I gotta get that thing out of me.

929
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,322
怎么做？
How?

930
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,881
不，停下，罗根
No, stop, Logan.

931
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:38,044
我预见你的死亡 我不会错的
I saw you die. I'm never wrong.

932
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,248
- 我从没错过  - 你不是一直都对的
- I'm never wrong. - You're not always right.

933
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,606
你预见不到老头要咬它
You didn't know the old man was gonna bite it.

934
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:42,797
我看到你在这样的房间
I saw you die in a room like this

935
01:32:42,797 --> 01:32:43,683
手里捧着你的心脏
with your heart in your hand.

936
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,729
我不能让她和那些怪物杀手在一起
I can't leave her with those freaks and killers.

937
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,568
我是她唯一的机会
I'm the only chance she's got,

938
01:32:47,568 --> 01:32:49,288
但是先要弄走那个东西
but not with that thing inside me.

939
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,521
你会死的，罗根
You're going to die, Logan.

940
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,125
或许我没事
Maybe that's okay.

941
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,403
不，听我说，罗根！
No, listen to me, Logan!

942
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,562
不要，停下 罗根！
No, stop. Logan!

943
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:59,091
你不会喜欢接下来这一幕
You're not gonna want to watch this part.

944
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,766
不！听我说！求你，不要！
No! Listen to me! Please, no!

945
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,971
不，停手 听我说
No, stop. Listen to me.

946
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,247
罗根！
Logan!

947
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:17,087
让开！
Move!

948
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,765
不要碰他！
Stay away from him.

949
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:21,929
是他杀了你的主人
He killed your master.

950
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:25,331
又勾搭上了你的姐姐
Put hands on your sister.

951
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,443
现在你却护着他？
And now you want him?

952
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,043
不 我看不见了
Oh, no. I can't see.

953
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,849
你永远只能是个乞丐
You'll always be a beggar.

954
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:35,962
你疯了
You're crazy.

955
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:45,327
惨了
Oh, no.

956
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,806
雪绪
Yukio.

957
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:38,401
罗根！
Logan!

958
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,682
罗根！罗根！
Logan! Logan!

959
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:49,686
罗根！
Logan!

960
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,048
不要打我的朋友
Don't hit my friends.

961
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,201
真理子在哪里？
Where's Mariko?

962
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:41,204
她被带走了 毒蛇抢走了她
She's gone. That viper bitch took her.

963
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,681
就是因为我的父亲的执念…
It was my father's obsession...

964
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:47,210
对变种沉迷，对上帝的错误沉迷…
With mutation, with God's mistakes...

965
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:50,548
像你和她一样
Like you and her,

966
01:35:50,548 --> 01:35:52,884
毁了这个家族
that ruined this house.

967
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:07,530
你要杀死自己的亲生女儿
You tried to kill your daughter.

968
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:11,645
背负这个恶名吧
Live with that.

969
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:29,650
你究竟是何方妖怪？
What kind of monster are you?

970
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,090
我是金刚狼
The Wolverine.

971
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:48,449
看着我，看着我 对了
Hey, come here, come here. That's it.

972
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:50,121
我错了
I was wrong.

973
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:52,171
我就说过
I told you.

974
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,084
让我瞧瞧
Let me have a look at you.

975
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,405
什么事也没有
It's nothing.

976
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,245
谢谢你
Hey, thank you.

977
01:38:02,144 --> 01:38:02,765
（来找她）

978
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:13,767
那是陷阱，罗根
It's a trap, Logan.

979
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,084
你为什么带我来这里？

980
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:36,965
你在隐藏什么东西？

981
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,850
你很快就会知道了

982
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:43,088
欢迎，真理子
Welcome, Mariko.

983
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:45,502
真理子，别害怕
It's all right, Mariko.

984
01:38:45,502 --> 01:38:47,449
她也是矢志田一家的
She also serves the house of Yashida.

985
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,011
她只效忠于自己
She serves herself.

986
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:51,447
她感染了罗根
She infected Logan.

987
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:54,321
那么爷爷呢？
And what about grandfather?

988
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:56,930
你让他感染什么？
What did you infect him with?

989
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,127
我满足了他临死时的愿望
I granted his dying wish.

990
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,842
我让他安眠
I helped him rest.

991
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,281
现在轮到你了
Now, it's your turn.

992
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,046
过来帮忙

993
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:44,471
听我说，变种人
Listen to me, mutant.

994
01:39:44,471 --> 01:39:45,885
她不能受到伤害
She will not be harmed.

995
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:48,964
她不会有事的
She will be fine.

996
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:52,242
只要你完成你的职责
So long as you do your job.

997
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:56,090
罗根很快就赶到了，你该准备好
Logan will be here soon, you should prepare.

998
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:58,887
引他过来是很容易
It was easy to lure him here.

999
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:00,730
要捉住他又是另外一回事了
It's another thing to capture him.

1000
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,883
我们准备好 他从没和黑色联盟交过手
We're ready. He's never faced the black clan.

1001
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:07,806
好的，那么…
Yes, well...

1002
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,962
往你的箭头上蘸点这个
Dip your arrows in this.

1003
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:14,409
杀不死他
It won't kill him,

1004
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,963
但是能把他困住
but it will slow him down.

1005
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,166
收好你的毒药
Keep your potions.

1006
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:20,921
他对付不了我们的 他很弱
He's no challenge for us now. He's weak.

1007
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:22,881
好吧
okay.

1008
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:27,929
如果你们失败了…
but when you fail...

1009
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:30,811
你们还有这个
You have this.

1010
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:50,283
你睡得香吗？
Did you have a nice rest?

1011
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,800
我不知道你做了什么
I don't know what you said or did

1012
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:00,320
可以欺骗原田和我的爷爷…
to deceive Harada or my grandfather...

1013
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:01,771
冷静一下
Now, now, calm down.

1014
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,922
是你的爷爷寻求我的帮助
Your grandfather sought me out.

1015
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:06,124
我现在是家族的主人
I am the head of this family now.

1016
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,971
你为什么会这么认为呢？
And why do you suppose that is?

1017
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:17,730
你为什么以为老头选中了你？
Why do you think the old man chose you?

1018
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:22,769
因为你强大？
Because you are strong?

1019
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:25,802
还是因为你软弱？
Or because you are weak?

1020
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,644
我知道你要来打架
I see you've come to fight.

1021
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:23,961
但这毫无意义
It's pointless.

1022
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:26,487
你很弱 寡不敌众的
You're weak. You're outnumbered.

1023
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:29,182
黑色联盟守护矢志田家族
The black clan has protected the house of Yashida

1024
01:42:29,768 --> 01:42:30,645
已经有700年历史
for 700 years.

1025
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:33,724
你就带了这么点人马？
Is that all the men you brought?

1026
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:38,650
我要去救她
I'm gonna get her.

1027
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,282
我们会感激你奋力保护真理子
We are grateful for your protection of Mariko.

1028
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:44,569
但是你要为她的家族再牺牲一件事
But there is one more sacrifice you must make for her family.

1029
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,002
滚一边去，小白脸
Go fuck yourself, pretty boy.

1030
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:57,639
开干！

1031
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:25,283
破风！上！

1032
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,001
雪绪，快跑！
Yukio, run!

1033
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:04,446
罗根
Logan.

1034
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:38,285
罗根
Logan.

1035
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:39,447
凯拉
Kayla.

1036
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:40,721
我爱你 凯拉！
I love you. Kayla!

1037
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:42,205
罗根
Logan.

1038
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,605
罗根！真理子！
Logan! Mariko!

1039
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,561
珍
Jean.

1040
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:54,011
救救我
Save me.

1041
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:27,208
退后 没有必要
Stand back. There is no need.

1042
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:29,329
她在哪里？真理子在哪里？
Where is she? Where's Mariko?

1043
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:30,441
她在哪里？
Where is she?

1044
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:33,522
“真理子在哪里？”
"Where is Mariko?"

1045
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:35,967
为伊消得人憔悴？
Still pining away?

1046
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:37,963
真是甜蜜
That's so sweet.

1047
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:41,003
惊讶吗？
Impressive, no?

1048
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:44,847
他是由艾德曼合金制成，和你一样
He is made of adamantium, just like you.

1049
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,977
罗根，知道吗，我懂了
Oh, Logan, you know what, I get it.

1050
01:49:57,977 --> 01:49:59,206
你绝望了
You're frustrated.

1051
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:01,482
我知道她在这里 我要见她
I know she's here. I want to see her.

1052
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:03,806
你要答案
You want answers.

1053
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:06,046
没错，我要答案！
Yes, I want answers!

1054
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:08,049
对不起，我也想说的更多
I'm sorry, I wish I could say more,

1055
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:10,049
但是谨慎才让我谋到这份工作
but I was hired in part for my discretion.

1056
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:11,087
我肯定你是
I'm sure you were.

1057
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:13,401
谨慎…
That...

1058
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:15,124
还有某种天分
and a certain talent

1059
01:50:15,124 --> 01:50:18,327
结合了生物化学和玄学方面的
for combining biochemistry and metaphysics.

1060
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:21,770
高等毒药是我的专长
High-grade toxins are my specialty.

1061
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:24,447
帮助我从遗传上免疫
It helps to be genetically immune

1062
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:26,921
人类所知的每样毒物，如我所是
to every poison known to man, as I am.

1063
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:31,891
也让我对男性的吸引力免疫…
And immune to the toxin that is man himself...

1064
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,371
如我所是
As I am.

1065
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:37,201
我跟你说，你这个变态变种贱人…
I'll tell you what, you twisted mutant bitch...

1066
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,684
何不解开我的手铐
Why don't you open these bracelets

1067
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,683
然后看看我们谁更厉害呢？
and we'll see who's made of what?

1068
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:48,886
爪子来了 我们可以开始
The claws. Now we can begin.

1069
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:53,847
我知道你关心他

1070
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:55,810
你需要忘了他

1071
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:58,168
你是矢志田家族的

1072
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:00,328
她背叛了我的爷爷

1073
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:02,091
你也一样

1074
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:03,482
不，真理子

1075
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:05,723
我们一起长大

1076
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,411
你要相信我

1077
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,363
让我去救他！

1078
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:13,000
他救了我的命！

1079
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:15,567
忘了他，真理子！

1080
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:17,080
这对我来说不容易，但是…

1081
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:20,210
我是追随爷爷的意愿

1082
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:23,762
你在你的体内找到的抑制虫是我的杰作
The suppressant bug you found inside of you was mine.

1083
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:26,691
你竟然自己取了出来
You took it out on your own.

1084
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:29,682
这点是我无法预料的
I didn't see that coming.

1085
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:31,530
毒蛇女人是邪恶的…

1086
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:33,489
你我都知道

1087
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:36,450
但她是完结一切的工具…

1088
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:37,762
她在哪里？
Where is she?

1089
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:39,564
你的爷爷想要的终结

1090
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:40,766
你很坚强
You are strong.

1091
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:42,844
也有勇气
You have courage.

1092
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:44,885
真正的勇气
Real courage.

1093
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:51,330
但是没有多大用处
But that won't help much now.

1094
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:05,806
什么…？
What the...?

1095
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:08,284
你需要相信我

1096
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,211
有那么难吗？

1097
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:13,531
我们命中注定在一起

1098
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,048
我们仍然还是

1099
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:18,405
或许吧

1100
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:48,082
住手！
Stop!

1101
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:55,561
简直是疯了

1102
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,321
我们走
Let's go.

1103
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:06,241
走啊！
Go!

1104
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:08,321
快跑！
Run!

1105
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:23,250
快走
Come on.

1106
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:40,331
真理子，快跑！跑啊！
Mariko, come! Go! Run!

1107
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:01,051
真理子，出去！
Mariko, get out!

1108
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:51,086
快点
Come on.

1109
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,126
这不是解决的方法
This is not the way.

1110
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:08,170
双手握紧
Two hands.

1111
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:13,726
主人…
Master...

1112
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,128
老弟！
Bub!

1113
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:44,648
原田

1114
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:52,845
对不起

1115
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:44,287
现在，你要死了
Now, you die.

1116
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:46,445
今天不是我的死期
Today is not my day.

1117
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:41,930
罗根君
Logan-San.

1118
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:44,128
不要这么惊讶
Don't look so shocked.

1119
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:50,366
有了你的帮助，我在长崎活下来了
With you at my side, I survived Nagasaki.

1120
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:53,171
自然，这次我也不会死
Surely, I could survive this.

1121
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:57,644
没关系 会让你死得痛快
It's all right. It won't take long.

1122
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:01,204
格林医生和我一直在等待机会
Dr. green and I have been waiting.

1123
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:05,041
只有这件装甲能让我存活下去
It's only this armor that's kept me alive.

1124
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:07,413
打造它让我变得强大
We built it to make me strong,

1125
02:00:07,413 --> 02:00:10,127
让我拿走你不愿意给的
so I can take what you would not give.

1126
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:13,489
把你不想要的复原能力…
And transfer your unwanted healing...

1127
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:16,567
传送给我的身体
To my body.

1128
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:22,128
我的遗产必须保存下去
My legacy must be preserved.

1129
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:26,407
你的错误是以为没有终结的生命…
Your mistake was to believe that a life without end...

1130
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:27,846
没有意义
Can have no meaning.

1131
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:33,650
这才是生命的意义
It is the only life that can.

1132
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,525
等一下
Hold on.

1133
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:38,523
我们快要完成了
We are almost there.

1134
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:42,685
宁静，你一直想要的宁静
The peace, the peace you've wanted.

1135
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:45,322
你的奖赏
Your reward.

1136
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:49,163
我在给予你彻底的死亡…
You know, I'm giving you the very death...

1137
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:51,882
你渴望的死亡
You longed for.

1138
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:05,727
我感觉到…
This feeling...

1139
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:09,406
无敌的感觉…
To be invincible...

1140
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,729
就和你一样
Like you.

1141
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:28,727
你是个怪物

1142
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:30,321
真理子
Mariko.

1143
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:33,560
是我 你的爷爷啊
It's me. Your grandfather.

1144
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:37,004
我亲手埋葬了我的爷爷
I buried my grandfather.

1145
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:42,811
你叫我来道别
You asked me to come say goodbye.

1146
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:45,169
永别了
Sayonara.

1147
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:09,363
没事吧你？
Are you all right?

1148
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:19,681
罗根
Logan.

1149
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:31,689
罗根
Logan.

1150
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:35,886
罗根
Logan.

1151
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:49,485
你来了
You're here.

1152
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:53,404
没错
Of course.

1153
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:57,008
能留下吗？
Can you stay?

1154
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:01,202
我不能
I can't.

1155
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:05,244
你可以的
Yes, you can.

1156
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:09,247
这是你所追求的
This is what you wanted.

1157
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:12,725
不再是了
Not anymore.

1158
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:20,246
我在这很寂寞
I'm all alone here.

1159
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:26,608
你把我送到这里
You put me here.

1160
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:30,926
你伤害了人，珍
You were hurting people, Jean.

1161
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:33,650
我别无选择
I had to.

1162
02:04:42,160 --> 02:04:44,322
我爱你，珍
I love you, Jean.

1163
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,683
永生不变
I always will.

1164
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,365
我不会寂寞的

1165
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:31,250
虽然只有你一个亲人了

1166
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:35,167
姐姐，多珍重

1167
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:51,809
我怎么觉得你很快会再探访我呢？
Am I wrong to think you might visit me soon?

1168
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:04,646
留下吧
Stay.

1169
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:07,810
我不能，公主阁下
I can't, princess.

1170
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:10,165
我是名战士
I'm a soldier,

1171
02:06:10,240 --> 02:06:12,004
我已经躲藏了太久
and I've been hiding too long.

1172
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:28,371
今晚《商业剖析》的头条，是矢志田真理子
In our business profile tonight, Mariko Yashida.

1173
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:31,330
矢志田两代之间传承家族的火炬…
A two-generation passing of the torch in the Yashida family...

1174
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:34,251
矢志田真理子从其爷爷手中接掌大权
As Mariko Yashida takes the helm from her grandfather,

1175
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:35,481
曾建立科技巨头的那个人
who built this tech giant.

1176
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:37,722
我知道一个企业的目的
I know it will always be the purpose

1177
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:39,882
是创造利益…
for a corporation to make a profit...

1178
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:42,058
但是矢志田工业坚信
But Yashida industries believes

1179
02:06:42,058 --> 02:06:44,329
可以和社会携手合作
we can also work with our community.

1180
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:52,847
那么，你决定了吗？
So, have you decided?

1181
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:56,322
什么？
What?

1182
02:06:56,760 --> 02:06:59,047
真理子说我们想去哪里都可以
Mariko says we can go wherever we want.

1183
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:00,929
只要说一个目的地
Just say where.

1184
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:03,491
