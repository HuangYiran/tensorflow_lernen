I can't believe Your mom's not coming to the wedding?

15

距婚礼还有31个小时

说真的  我不想再哭了
Okay, seriously, I-I need to stop crying.

17
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,000
你们知道怎么止住眼泪吗
Does anyone know how to turn this off?

18
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,740
是不是有个开关什么的
Is there, like, a button or something?

19
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,040
要我帮你找找吗
Want me to feel around for it?

20
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,550
可能在你的背上
It's probably somewhere on your back.

21
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,220
-住手  -怎么了  我只是想让你高兴点
- Stop it. - What? I'm trying to cheer you up.

22
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,430
我觉得现阶段这是不可能的
I don't think that's possible at this point.

I just need to get myself to stop crying, that's all.

26
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,310
鬼来了
Boogity-boo!

27
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,670
莉莉 你干嘛啊  她又不是打嗝
Lily, what the hell?! It's not the hiccups.

28
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,590
我只是凭直觉做事
I was just going on a hunch.

29
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,610
现在我开始打嗝了
And now I have the hiccups.

30
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,400
各位  真的不用担心我  好吗
Look, guys, just, seriously, don't worry about me, okay?

31
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,850
请让我用自己的方式解决
Just let me deal with this on my own.

32
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,810
恕我做不到  罗宾
I'm afraid that's not possible, Robin.

33
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,420
只要我接受了挑战  就绝不会反悔
Once I've accepted a challenge, it cannot be unaccepted.

34
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,530
挑战不成功  决不罢休
I will not rest until the job is done.

35
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,250
是吗
Oh, is that so?

36
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,200
那我们的尿布和咖喱角在哪
Then where are our diapers and samosas?

37
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,550
<i>尿布和咖喱角  这件事发生在六个月前</i>
<i>Diapers and samosas. Oh, that's the story</i>

38
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,020
<i>也就是2012年的秋天</i>
<i>that took place six months earlier in the fall of 2012.</i>

39
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,080
少校想要一杯鸡尾酒
Major craving for a mojito.

40
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,270
天啊  
Oh, god,

41
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,190
你们又在玩白痴的内部[二等兵]玩笑吗
we're back to your stupid little private joke again?

42
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,350
七年过去了  你们居然还在玩这个
Are you guys really still doing this seven years later?

43
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,500
真烦人  不许玩了
It's so annoying. Just stop it.

44
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,410
二等兵玩笑

七年过去了  你们居然还在玩这个

真烦人  不许玩了
It's so annoying. Just stop it.

47
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,530
谁会向二等兵敬礼啊
You don't salute a private!

48
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,220
-我去去就回  -好
- I'll be right back. - All right.

49
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,320
莉莉  你在偷蹭小腿勾搭我吗
Lily, are you playing footsie with me?

50
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,850
什么  不是不是
What? Oh, no, no.

51
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,630
我只是试探下你的小腿在哪里
I was just feeling around for your shin.

52
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,080
我的小腿  为什么你要...
My shin? Why would you...?

53
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,860
你干嘛踢我
Ow! Why'd you do that?

54
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,940
提醒你痛是什么感觉
To remind you what pain is.

55
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,410
你和罗宾再保持这种暧昧的亲密关系
You keep it up with all the cutesy-tootsy stuff with Robin,

56
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,960
小心生出更多的事端
gonna be a whole lot more where that came from.

57
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,920
莉莉  你不用担心
Lily, you have nothing to worry about.

58
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,880
我才不会  你和罗宾是纯友谊
I better not. You and Robin are platonic.

59
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,790
拜托  泰德和罗宾才不是纯友谊
Please. Ted and Robin are not platonic.

60
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,790
就像我和罗宾不是纯友谊那样
Just like me and Robin are not platonic.

61
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,190
世界上两个单身的人永远不可能
Just like no two single people in the world

62
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,620
保持纯友谊关系
are ever platonic.

63
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,300
观点就是  如果在二十分钟内
Symposium: two people are only platonic

64
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,610
两个人都没有勾搭对方的苗头
if in the next 20 minutes there is no

65
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,050
那就是纯友谊关系
chance of them hooking up.

66
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,480
老实说  我只认识两个人能保持纯友谊关系
Truth is, I only know of one genuinely platonic relationship.

67
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,360
你和我
You and me.

68
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,810
别开玩笑了  莉莉
Don't make me laugh, Lily.

69
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,350
你超级想勾搭我的好吗
You want to hit this so hard.

70
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,950
说真的  她正偷蹭我腿呢
Seriously, she's playing footsies with me as I... Ow!

71
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,850
我说的是马修和罗宾
No, I'm talking about Marshall and Robin.

72
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,630
即使如下情况发生  马修和罗宾绝不会搞上
Marshall and Robin wouldn't hook up even if this happened:

73
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,150
马修  罗宾
Marshall, Robin!

74
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,820
如果你们俩二十分钟内不火力全开亲热的话
If you guys don't full-on make out in the next 20 minutes,

75
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,640
他们就会炸了我和酒吧里的所有人
they're gonna blow me up and everyone in this bar!

76
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,980
天啊  除了罗宾谁都行
My God, no! Anyone but Robin.

77
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,260
我真的不想这么做
I really don't want to do this!

78
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,700
我们没时间了  快点
Guys, we have no time! Just do it!

79
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,430
十九分钟后

80
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,670
对不起  宝贝  我做不到
I'm sorry, baby, I just, I can't do it.

81
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,750
我是唯一的幸存者
And the only survivor was me

82
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,370
因为我正在楼上  和泰德的妈妈上床
because I was upstairs banging Ted's mom.

83
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,770
什么  去要金发女郎的电话吗
What? Get that blond girl's phone number?

84
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,470
接受挑战
Challenge accepted.

85
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,010
未知来电者  别打了
Unknown caller, stop calling me.

86
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,030
你要接吗
Are you gonna answer it?

87
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,770
你以为现在是1994年
Yeah, 'cause it's 1994

88
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,680
即使不知道来电者是谁
and I'm gonna pick up a phone

89
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,350
我也会接电话吗
without knowing who's on the other end.

90
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,710
-我该走了  -泰德
- I should get going. - Ted...

91
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,470
莉莉  根据"纯友谊"这个词的所有解释
Lily, by every definition of the word platonic,

92
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,800
包括巴尼那个假解释
including Barney's fake one,

93
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,810
我可以百分百确定
I can say with total certainty...

94
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,210
甘蓝菜
that Brussels sprouts

95
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,300
是21世纪再度走红的蔬菜
are the comeback vegetable of the 21st century.

96
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,260
-回见  -再见
- Well, see you guys later. - Bye.

97
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,220
挑战成功
Challenge completed.

98
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,640
抱歉  我错过了前半部分
I'm sorry. I-I missed the first half of this.

99
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,710
一个喝醉的妞  独坐在那里
Um, why is picking up a drunk chick sitting alone

100
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,330
手指抚摸着婚戒留下的痕迹
and rubbing a tan line on her finger

101
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,390
你泡到她是应该的  怎么能称为挑战呢
where a wedding ring used to be, a challenge?

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,870
因为我说接受挑战啊
Because I said challenge accepted.

103
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,700
看  这就是你的问题了  巴尼
See? That's your problem, Barney.

104
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,570
你只接受你想出来的挑战
You only accept challenges you came up with.

105
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,180
你什么时候也接受
Just once, I'd like to see you accept

106
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,560
别人提出的挑战
someone else's challenge.

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,950
挑战接...  等等  什么挑战
Challenge acc... Wait-- What's the challenge?

108
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,170
有意思
Interesting.

109
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,010
一个充满无限可能的机会
An opportunity rife with possibilities.

110
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,090
我们得来点有想象力的挑战
We need to find something with just the right amount of poetic...

111
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,200
学海豚说话  去要女孩子的电话
Get a girl's number while talking like a dolphin!

112
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,130
那也行
That works.

113
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,740
接受挑战

114
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,590
哈林花式篮球

115
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,860
睁大眼睛看清楚  裁判  那不是怀孕的女人
Open your eyes, ref! That's not a pregnant lady!

116
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,060
他衣服里面藏着一颗篮球
It's a basketball under his shirt!

117
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,760
快吹哨子啊
Blow the freakin' whistle!

118
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,260
巴尼说得对
Anyways, Barney's right;

119
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,550
我肯定情愿让酒吧被炸掉
I would absolutely let the bar blow up.

120
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,040
但是你会死  莉莉也会死
But you'd die, and Lily would die, too.

121
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,780
没错  但能让我们的魂魄留在酒吧里吓人
Yeah, but then we could haunt the bar for eternity

122
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,980
这正中我们下怀
like we always planned.

123
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,700
总之  罗宾是你的女人
Anyways, Robin's your girl.

124
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,660
我们怎么老是回到这个话题[这里]呢
Why do we keep coming back to this?

125
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,050
比赛有趣  票也便宜  还能离家出来透透气
It's fun. Tickets are cheap. Gets us out of the house.

126
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,580
我是说我和罗宾
No, me and Robin.

127
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,080
因为罗宾告诉我  她还爱着你
Because Robin told me that she's still in love with you.

128
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,700
你说真的吗
Are you seriou?

129
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,060
罗宾告诉你  她还爱我吗
Robin told you that she's still in love with me?

130
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,740
没说  是我编的
No, I just made that up.

131
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,450
不过这假话说值了  因为你的表情
But it was worth it because I can tell

132
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,280
告诉我你还对罗宾还有感觉
by that look on your face that you still have feelings for Robin.

133
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,900
球放在篮筐上了
Okay, ball is sitting on the basket!

134
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,150
虽然没有犯规  但是不安全
That's not only illegal, it's unsafe!

135
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,220
拜托  金斯  防御啊
Come on, Gens, D up!

136
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,980
康乃迪克州的森里里有一家修道院
It's this monastery in Connecticut out in the woods,

137
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,090
那里的修女能做出美味的奶酪
and the nuns there, they make this gourmet cheese.

138
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,560
超级好吃的
It's just amazing.

139
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,510
这已经是第三杯酒了吗
Wow, was that three glasses of wine?

140
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,890
时间过得真快
Where does the time go.

141
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,480
我知道你要回去做研究了
Look, I know that you need to get back to your studies.

142
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,770
要不我们改天再约吧
Maybe we could get together some other time?

143
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,490
不  不可能吧
No! Not possible!

144
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,440
那是我一生中最精彩的表演
It was the performance of a lifetime.

145
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,890
如果我和她再多待一会
Man, if I'd have hung around for a few more minutes,

146
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,790
我可能已经让她
I probably could have gotten her

147
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,920
-摸我的"喷水孔"了  -手机给我
- to touch my blowhole. - Give me that.

148
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,050
喂
Hello?

149
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,800
你刚刚把你的电话给了一个
Hi, did you just give your phone number to a guy

150
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,650
像海豚一样叽叽叫的男人吗
who was squeaking like a dolphin?

151
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,060
是的
Yeah.

152
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,020
亲爱的  听我一句
Honey, listen to me.

153
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,310
我要你这一年  这一整年
I need you to take a year, a full year

154
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,140
都保持独身  知道吗
and just be celibate, okay?

155
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,530
不要接触男人
No boys.

156
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,490
一年
One year.

157
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,740
你知道我是对的
I think you know I'm right about this.

158
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,820
-你是对的  -没错
- You're right. - Yeah.

159
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,510
真是让人心酸
That was heartbreaking.

160
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,480
裤子也栓不住
And pants-breaking Boing-oing-oing!

161
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,120
好了  下一个挑战
All right, next challenge.

162
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,250
今晚都要玩这个吗
Oh, this is an all-night thing?

163
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,660
好吧  穿着垃圾袋
Okay, um, pick up a girl...

164
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,810
去泡个妞
wearing a garbage bag.

165
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,350
非常"乐意"
I'd be "Glad" To.

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,770
"乐意"'和"巨大"两者皆为垃圾袋制造商

167
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,770
希望她别太"巨大"
Just hope she's not too "Hefty."

168
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,700
我只能想到这两个垃圾袋品牌
And those are all of the brands of trash bags I can think of.

169
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,850
我还没说完
I'm not done.

170
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,840
你也不能说带"E"的字
You also can't use the letter "E."

171
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,010
"几"受挑战
Challng... accptd-d.

172
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,980
你是单身  她也是单身
You're single, she's single.

173
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,300
是时候在一起了
It's time to do this.

174
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,540
你之所以这么说  是因为你和莉莉打赌
You're only saying this because you bet Lily

175
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,050
我和罗宾最后会在一起
that Robin and I would end up together,

176
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,400
你想赢那五块钱
and you want that five bucks.

177
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,040
我想要那五块钱  泰德
I need that five bucks, Ted.

178
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,940
但是更重要的是  我想要你开心
But more importantly, I need you to be happy.

179
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,560
马修  我们之间是纯友谊
Marshall, we're platonic.

180
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,890
可你们之间才不是纯友谊
But you're not platonic!

181
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,650
你离你的幸福生活只有短短二十分钟的时间
You are 20 short minutes away from happily ever after.

182
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,310
当然  如果你现在就出发的话
I mean, if you left right now.

183
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,510
从我们相遇的那一刻  我就爱上了你
I have loved you from the moment we met.

184
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,640
命中注定我们要在一起
I know we're meant to be together.

185
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,270
我每分每秒都想跟你在一起
I don't want to waste another second without you.

186
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,520
我们重新开始好不好
Let's give it another shot.

187
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,620
好呀
Okay!

188
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,070
不会吧
No!

189
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,230
你输了  宝贝  付钱吧
Pay up, baby. Pay up.

190
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,210
太好了
Oh, yes!

191
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,890
乖乖的五块钱   快到我的碗里来 *
* Sweet, sweet five bucks, you soon will be mine

192
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,690
虽然我和莉莉的钱都共享 *
* Even though Lily and I share bank accounts

193
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,260
你还是属于我的 *  
* You're already mine to begin with.

194
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,010
抱歉
Sorry.

195
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,910
而你和罗宾从此也会
And you and Robin get a lifetime of happiness,

196
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,180
幸福快乐一辈子 
so there's that.

197
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,100
但你最好赶快行动
But you better hurry up

198
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,050
免得别人把她抢走了
before some other guy snatches her up.

199
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,230
是吗  谁是我的竞争对手呢
Really? And who's my competition?

200
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,330
好  不能用到字母E  不能用到字母E
Okay, don't use the letter "E." Don't use the letter "E."

201
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,400
嗨[hEy]  糟糕
Hey. Damn it.

202
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,700
你好  我...叫...巴尼[barnEy]
Hi. I... am...Barney.

203
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,460
讨厌  我名字里就有个E
Damn it! There's an E in my name!

204
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,420
你好  我叫
Hi. My word for...

205
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,880
我自己巴...诺
this guy is Barno.

206
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,920
巴诺  你长得
Barno. You look...

207
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,910
不丑
not ugly.

208
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,920
你的...  号码
Your... dial thing...

209
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,170
是多少
is what?

210
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,940
你想和我一起回我家吗
Do you want to just go back to my place?

211
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,040
好啊[yEs]  又错了
Yes. Damn it!

212
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,420
我想请你喝一杯
I want to buy you a drink.

213
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,590
不过  我该怎么称呼你
But first, what do I call you?

214
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,000
E莲・艾E斯坦
Elaine Edelstein.

215
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,880
我还是干脆明天
How about I just call you...

216
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,420
打给你吧
tomorrow?

217
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,990
小姐  你的号码是
Your digits, m'lady?

218
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,470
说真的  两位
Seriously, guys,

219
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,540
出点更有难度的题好吗
you're gonna have to try harder than that.

220
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,600
接受挑战
Challenge accepted.

221
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,140
你好 
Excuse me, hi.

222
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,930
我是瑞恩・高斯林的个人助理
I'm Ryan Gosling's personal assistant.

223
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,090
他刚才看见你走进这酒吧
He saw you as you were walking in,

224
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,530
于是他派我过来  请你在这里等他
and he sent me over to tell you to wait here.

225
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,580
别激动  这可是真事哦
Be cool. This is real, okay?

226
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,400
不过呢  瑞恩这人特别害羞
But listen, Ryan is super shy.

227
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,930
我知道
I know.

228
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,020
如果他进来时看到
Which means that if he comes in here

229
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,200
你在和其他男人说话  
and he sees you talking to some other guy,

230
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,490
他肯定转头就走
he's gonna turn right around and leave.

231
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,250
明白的话就点点头
Nod if you understand.

232
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,590
吧台的红发妞
Redhead at the bar.

233
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,430
接受挑战 
Challenge accepted.

234
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,120
-你好  -滚开
- Hey, there. - Get away from me!

235
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,740
你是不是在尽力输球啊  艾迪
It's like you're trying to lose, Eddie!

236
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,170
艾迪  我上次看见
Hey, Eddie, last time I saw

237
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,720
这么多失误[小馅饼]还是在面包店呢
this many turnovers was at a bakery.

238
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,250
-你到底要不要行动  -不要
- So are you doing this or what? - No.

239
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,350
而且  就算我要这么做
And for the record, if I were gonna do it,

240
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,360
我也不会对她说"我们应该重新来过"
I wouldn't just be, like, "Hey, we should get back together."

241
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,830
这也太外行了吧
Amateur hour.

242
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,420
哥教你该怎么做
Here's how you do it.

243
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,210
借过  不好意思
Excuse me. Okay, sorry.

244
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,540
抱歉 
Sorry.

245
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,810
现在去屋顶

246
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,950
别走  有小偷
Stop, thief!

247
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,920
那只蓝色法国号  真是太浪漫了
The blue French horn, it's so romantic!

248
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,640
我的天  你知道你是谁吗
Oh, my God, do you know who you are?!

249
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,580
擅长写浪漫爱情故事的小说家  著有《恋恋笔记本》等

250
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,580
你是尼可拉斯・史派克
You're Nicholas Sparks!

251
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,940
各位  有位名人在此
Hey, everybody, we got a, uh, celebrity

252
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,940
让我们欢迎  尼古拉斯・史派克
in the crowd over here. We got, uh, Nicholas Sparks!

253
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,370
等我说完好不好
You didn't let me finish.

254
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,960
泰德  听我说
Ted, listen...

255
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,020
我不想再经历一次这种事了
I can do without reliving that.

256
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,200
你是瞎眼了吗
Are you completely blind?

257
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,770
什么
What?

258
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,610
你睁眼看看好吗  裁判
Open your eyes, ref!

259
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,080
那球已经整整7分钟没落地了
The ball hasn't touched the ground in seven minutes!

260
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,050
裁判  检查一下你的语音信箱
Hey, ref, check your voicemail!

261
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,960
你错过了不少电话[犯规]呢
I think you've missed a few calls!

262
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,060
你是瞎眼了吗
Are you completely blind?!

263
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,320
你是说我还是
Wait-- me or...?

264
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,330
当然是你  泰德
You, Ted!

265
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,380
罗宾的想法已经改变了 
Robin has changed her mind.

266
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,100
才怪  罗宾根本没改变
No, Robin doesn't change her mind.

267
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,220
她真的变了
Except that she does.

268
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,180
记得她以前有多讨厌
Remember how she used to claim

269
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,220
白人放克乐团吗
to hate white guy funk bands?

270
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,740
结果在我乐团
And yet, at the farewell performance of my band,

271
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,120
"放克  放克  一直放到死"的告别演出上
"The Funk, the Whole Funk and Nothing but the Funk,"

272
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,560
罗宾随着音乐点头呢
there's Robin rhythmically nodding her head

273
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,140
还大声要求我们唱"放弃放克"这首歌
and shouting out a request for "Give Up the Funk."

274
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,070
我想她当时点头  是因为我问她
I think she was nodding her head in response to my question,

275
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,730
"你想现在回家吗"
"Do you want to leave soon?"

276
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,910
而且她是认真地
And she was legitimately suggesting

277
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,650
叫你们别再玩放克了
that you give up the funk.

278
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,250
别说这事了  我已经向前看了 
Can we just drop this? I have moved on.

279
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,800
你根本没有
Well, except that you haven't.

280
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,330
你不会突然想到蓝色法国号的点子
You didn't just come up with this blue French horn thing.

281
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,650
你之前肯定有考虑过这招
You've thought about this.

282
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,750
史派克先生
Mr. Sparks?

283
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,280
我好喜欢你的《恋恋笔记本》
I loved The Notebook.

284
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,260
艾迪  你都落后八十分了
Eddie, you're down by 80.

285
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,320
你认真比赛好不好
Will you watch the game?

286
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:19,930
别再靠近我
Do not come any closer!

287
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,450
不然我一定灭了你
I swear to God I will kill you.

288
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,110
好  我保证不靠近了
It's cool. I'm not gonna come any closer.

289
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,500
你一直在看门那边  你是在等人
You're looking at the door, you're waiting for someone.

290
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,910
某个重要的人  
Someone important,

291
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,400
某个能填补你生活空虚的人
someone who will fill an empty space in your life.

292
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,330
电影明星
A movie star?

293
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,250
是哪一个呢
But which one?

294
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,710
克鲁尼  李奥纳多  泽布卡[巴尼最爱的空手道小子]
Clooney, DiCaprio, Zabka...?

295
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,030
都不是
No...

296
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,480
我猜是瑞恩
I'm gonna go with Ryan...

297
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,960
雷诺
Reyn...

298
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,750
菲利普
Phil-Phillip...

299
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,040
西克[美偶主持]  高斯林
Seacr... Gosling...

300
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,560
瑞恩・高斯林
Ryan Gosling!

301
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,340
没错  我等的就是瑞恩・高斯林
Yes, I'm waiting for Ryan Gosling, okay?

302
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,960
别再烦我了
Now, leave me alone.

303
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,860
姑娘  你通过了我的考验  
You passed my test, girl.

304
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,120
-瑞恩  -不可能
- Ryan? - No.

305
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,830
这绝对...不可能
Just... no.

306
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,700
我告诉她我是演技派
I told her I'm a method actor.

307
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,450
我做了整容手术
And I had to get plastic surgery

308
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,150
为了在下一部戏里
for an upcoming role where I play a man

309
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,760
扮演一个比瑞恩本人还帅的角色
much more handsome than myself.

310
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,110
恭喜你  你赢了
Congratulations, you win.

311
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,590
赢了  不  我才不在乎赢呢
Win? No, I don't want to win.

312
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,400
我还想继续玩呢  再来几个挑战吧
I want to keep playing. More challenges.

313
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,160
好吧  你想要挑战吗
Fine, you want another challenge?

314
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,690
再来一个  再来一个
More challenges, more challenges.

315
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,360
好  你的挑战就是
Fine, here's your challenge.

316
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,250
去药店买点尿布回来
Go down to the pharmacy and buy some diapers.

317
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,280
再去印度馆子帮我买个印度咖喱角
And, uh, get me a Samosa from the Indian place.

318
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,150
这只是叫我跑腿办事吧
Sounds like an errand.

319
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,410
同时钓个妹子回来
While picking up a girl.

320
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,980
接受挑战
Challenge accepted!

321
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,880
拜托
Come on!

322
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,280
从前那个不管结局如何
Whatever happened to the guy who wasn't afraid to charge

323
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,790
勇于行动的人哪去了
headlong into the unknown?

324
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,150
结局显而易见
What unknown?

325
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,500
没错  八年前
Sure, eight years ago

326
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,110
当我偷那只蓝色法国号时
when I stole that blue French horn, yeah.

327
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,380
结局还是未知数
That was the unknown.

328
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,690
可现在  同样的事已经发生过好几次
But now? I mean, how many times have we been here?

329
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,670
我很清楚结局是什么
I know exactly what's gonna happen.

330
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,420
你知道还有谁最清楚结局吗
You know who else knew exactly what was gonna happen, Ted?

331
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,930
1971年1月5日的华盛顿将军队
The Washington Generals on January 5, 1971.

332
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,020
他们知道自己会输 
They knew they were gonna lose,

333
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,160
却还是上场比赛
but they went in there anyway,

334
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,120
打出他们最好的表现
and then gave it their best shot.

335
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,780
最后取得了胜利  泰德
And they won that game, Ted!

336
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,240
这就是他们唯一获胜的原因
For one reason and for one reason only.

337
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,790
因为计分出错  还是敌方的卡里・尼尔还身患感冒
A scoring error and the fact that Curly Neal had the flu?

338
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,750
是毅力
Perseverance.

339
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,650
那是将军队历史上唯一一场胜利
It was the only win in Generals history,

340
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,320
但一场足以代表一切
but that's all you need.

341
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,180
只要赢一次就好
Just one win.

342
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,180
我去买点啤酒
I'm gonna go grab us some beers.

343
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,090
我不知道你是谁  也不管你想推销什么
Hi, I don't know who this is or what you're trying to sell,

344
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,120
可你打扰到我看哈林篮球赛了
but you are disturbing me during the Globetrotters.

345
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,660
泰德  我是哈蒙德・德鲁瑟
Hello, Ted, it's Hammond Druthers.

346
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,120
目标确定
Target acquired.

347
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,420
我正在为
I‘m recruiting volunteers

348
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,940
我工作的狗狗孤儿院招募志愿者
for the starving puppy orphanage where I work.

349
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,920
我是免费帮忙的
For free.

350
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,540
你可以留下你的电话号码吗
So, if you wouldn't mind just writing your number down

351
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,800
就写在报名表上
on this signup sheet...?

352
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,970
我很感谢你想要
Listen, I appreciate that you feel

353
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,300
我的电话号码
like you need my number.

354
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,110
也许是因为你为了某事伤心
Maybe it's because you're really sad about something

355
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,020
而这是你减轻痛苦的办法
and this is your way of feeling better about yourself.

356
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,840
但是
But...

357
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,890
因为我有男友  而且我相当肯定
since I have a boyfriend, and I'm pretty sure

358
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,530
你之前在那边管我叫"目标"
I heard you call me a target earlier over there,

359
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,680
-什么  -我会走开
- Wha...? - I'm gonna go ahead

360
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,310
不会给你我的号码
and not give you my number.

361
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,290
我要给你一些更棒的东西
I'm gonna give you something even better.

362
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,440
直奔主题了啊
Wow, right to the chase.

363
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,730
我去六号货道等你
Meet you in aisle six.

364
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,760
-我要给你这个  -好的
- I'm gonna give you this. - Okay.

365
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,070
一切都会好起来的
It's gonna be okay.

366
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,320
你是个好人
You're a good guy.

367
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,400
你一定会熬过这段伤心日子
You will get through this.

368
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,580
好吧
Uh, okay.

369
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,160
有怪人出没
Weirdo alert.

370
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,160
你见过...

不好意思
Excuse me.

372
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,200
你说"伤心"是什么意思
What do you mean "sad"?

373
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,430
泰德
Ted?

374
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,750
我是从伊利诺伊州芝加哥打给你的
I'm calling you from Chicago, Illinois

375
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,030

你建了座凹面的大玻璃楼

那玻璃楼把对面街的几栋楼给熔了
And it melted a few buildings across the street.

381
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,290
好吧  但是拜托

385
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,240
干掉了数千条非常稀有的鱼

那已经是历史了  泰德  我已经向前看了
That's the past, Ted. I'm looking forward.

387
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,390
我要你加入我的团队
I want you on my team.

388
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,060
我不接受"不"这个答案
And I won't take no for an answer.

389
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,950
-不  -我想你没听清楚我的话  泰德
- No. - I don't think you heard me, Ted.

390
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,460
-不  -别这样  泰德
- No. - Come on, Ted!

391
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,770
求你了

392
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,870
如果你同意  公司会给我停车位
They're gonna give me a parking spot if you say yes.

- Do I get a parking spot? - Well, we can go tandem.

394
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,720
-不  -隔周换着用呢
- No. - Every other week then?

395
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,260
-不  -其实芝加哥非常适合步行
- No. - You know, Chicago's more of a walking town.

396
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,020
-不  -算你狠
- No. - All right!

397
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,880
停车位归你了
You can have the parking spot.

398
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,000
你这是同意了吗
So, that's a yes?

399
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,470
-不  -听着  泰德
- Mm, no. - Look, Ted.

400
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,860
我能让你的日子非常不好过
I can make your life very difficult.

401
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,980

404
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,150
我会死占着你的脸书墙不下来
I will live on your Facebook wall!

405
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,130
我们不是脸书好友
We're not Facebook friends.

406
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,810
对啊  这是怎么回事
Yeah, what's going on with that?

407
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,480
我都已经申请了八个月了
It's been pending, like, for eight months now.

408

而且我貌似
And I-I may have told

414
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,180
告诉了这里的合伙人  咱俩是死党
the partners here that you and I are very, very good friends.

415
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,210
求你了  说你会考虑一下  好吗

这还只是玩票性质的一晚
And this was an off night.

421
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,870
我怎么可能会有伤心事
What can I possibly be sad about?

422
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,000
我觉得你之前碰到了真爱  却搞砸了
I think you were in love and you messed it up.

435
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,340
你在吃橄榄
You're eating olives.

436
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,560
是的
Yup.

437
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,710
你要这个吗
Do you want these?

438
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,190
我讨厌橄榄
I hate olives.

439
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,090
你不是讨厌橄榄吗
I... thought you hate olives.

440
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,370
我想我改变想法了

441

449
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,220
-你不会的  -我不会  但你听好了

When I hang up this phone, you and I are done.

453
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,110
-这扇门关上了  -好的

这扇门永远对你敞开  泰德

455

我想他会来的
I think he's coming around.

458

我们过去谈过恋爱
We tried dating a while back

459

不知道
I don't know.

465
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,020
我觉得自己也许还没有碰上真命天子
I think maybe I still haven't met the right guy.

466
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,660
我想想有没有认识的人可以介绍给你
I wonder if I know someone to set you up with.

我现在在人生巅峰
I'm kind of at my peak right now.

我不知道能否潇洒地从游戏人生中抽身而去
I don't know if I can just walk away from the game.

不  不行  不行

478
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,330
二十分钟可远远不够
It's gonna take a lot more than 20 minutes.

479
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,370
你需要付出你的一切
This is gonna take everything you have got.

480

You got work to do.

489
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,590
我们不是纯友谊
We're not platonic.

490
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,800
也许算是"类似纯友谊"吧
Platon-ish, maybe.

491
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,940
不知道这算不算一个词
If that's even a word.

492

你为什么没这样做呢
Well, why don't you?

500
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,650
我不知道

如果是命中注定  等时机到了自然就会在一起
it's gonna happen, it'll happen when it happens.

506
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,700
我不会离开  她不会离开
I'm not going anywhere, she's not going anywhere.

507
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,780
急什么呢  对吧
