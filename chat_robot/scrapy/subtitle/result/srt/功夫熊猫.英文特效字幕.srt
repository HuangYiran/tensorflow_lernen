00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One way in, one way out.

216

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, except that prisoner...

218
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...is Tai Lung.

219
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take us down.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

221
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my.

222

224
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:33,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's nothing to worry about.\nIt's perfectly safe.

225
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crossbows! At the ready!

226
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crossbows?

227
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, tough guy, did you hear?

228
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oogway's giving someone the Dragon\nScroll, and it's not gonna be you.

229
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't get him mad.

230
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's he gonna do about it?\nI've got him completely immobilized.

231
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?

232
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm good. I've seen enough.

233
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll tell Shifu he\nhas nothing to worry about.

234
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, he doesn't.

235
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll tell him that.

236
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can we please go now?

237
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

238
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a second!

239
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think there's been a slight mistake.\nEveryone seems to think that I'm...

240
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!

241
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at this place.

242

244
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,390

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Invisible Trident of Destiny!

246
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've only seen paintings\nof that painting.

247
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

250
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello.

251
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you finished sight-seeing?

252
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry, I should have come to you first.

253
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My patience is wearing thin.

254
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I mean, it's not like you\nwere going anywhere.

255
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Would you turn around?\n- Sure.

256
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's it going?

257
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you get 5,000...\nMaster Shifu!

258
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone... broke that.

259
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'll fix it. Do you have some...

260
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...glue?

261
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A splinter.

262
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior?

263
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I guess so.\n- Wrong!

264
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:16,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will\nnever be the Dragon Warrior until...

265
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you have learned the secret\nof the Dragon Scroll.

266
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, how does this work?

267
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have a ladder,\nor a trampoline, or?

268
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think it's that easy?\nThat I'll just hand you the secret

269
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- to limitless power?\n- No, I...

270
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One must first master\nthe highest level of kung fu.

271
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that is impossible\nif that one is someone like you.

272
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone like me?

273
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, look at you!\nThis fat butt! Flabby arms!

274
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.

275
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this ridiculous belly.

276
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And utter disregard\nfor personal hygiene.

277
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, wait a minute.\nThat's uncalled for.

278
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't stand that close.\nI can smell your breath.

279
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, Oogway said I was...

280
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Wuxi Finger Hold.\nNot the Wuxi Finger Hold!

281
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you know this hold?

282
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Developed by Master Wuxi\nin the Third Dynasty.

283
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then you know what happens\nwhen I flex my pinky.

284
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, no!\n- You know the hardest part of this?

285
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The hardest part is cleaning up\nafterwards.

286
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, OK, take it easy.

287
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:26,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now listen closely, panda.

288
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oogway may have picked you,\nbut when I'm through with you,

289
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise you, you're going to wish\nhe hadn't! Are we clear?

290
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we're clear. We're so clear.

291
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

292
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't wait to get started.

293
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's begin.\n- Wait, wait, wait.

294
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

295
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Now?\n- Yes, now.

296
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:33,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unless the great Oogway was wrong\nand you are not the Dragon Warrior.

297
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, OK, well...

298
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know\nif I can do all of those moves.

299
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if we don't try,\nwe'll never know, will we?

300
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find\nsomething more suited to my level.

301
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What level is that?

302
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I'm not a master, but...

303
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...let's just start at zero. Level zero.

304
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. There is no such thing\nas level zero.

305
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Maybe I can start with that.\n- That?

306
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We use that for training children and\npropping the door open when it's hot.

307
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you insist...

308
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Furious Five!

309
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:14,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're bigger than your action figures.\nExcept, you, Mantis. You're the same.

310
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead, panda.\nShow us what you can do.

311
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:25,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are they gonna watch, or should I wait\ntill they get back to work?

312
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hit it.

313
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:30,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate.\nSo I'm still digesting.

314
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So my kung fu might not be\nas good as... later on.

315
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just hit it.

316
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

317
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What you got? You got nothing,\n'cause I got it right here.

318
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You picking on my friends?\nGet ready to feel thunder.

319
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm coming at you with crazy feet.

320
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. I'm a blur.\nYou've never seen bear style.

321
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've only seen praying mantis.

322
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or monkey style.

323
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or I could come at you snickety-snake.

324
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you hit it!

325
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. All right.

326
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you try again?\nA little harder.

327
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's that?

328
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}(tooth)

329
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That hurts.

330
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This will be easier than I thought.

331
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm feeling a little nauseous!

332
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those are hard!

333
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My tenders.

334
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did I do?

335
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:19,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is now a level zero.

336
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There's no words.\n- No denying that.

337
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was Master Oogway thinking?

338
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The poor guy's gonna get himself killed.

339
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is so mighty!

340
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:34,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky\non a ball of fire!

341
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When he walks, the very ground shakes!

342
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One would think Master Oogway would\nchoose someone who knew kung fu.

343
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.

344
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or even see his toes.

345
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

346
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great.

347
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. You're up.

348
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am now.

349
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just...

350
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some day, huh?

351
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That kung fu stuff is hard work, right?\nAre your biceps sore?

352
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:54,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've had a long\nand rather disappointing day, so...

353
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I should probably\nget to sleep now.

354
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.\n- OK, thanks.

355
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just...\nMan, I'm such a big fan!

356
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys were amazing\nat the Battle of Weeping River.

357
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Outnumbered a thousand to one,\nbut you didn't stop. You just...

358
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry about that.

359
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, you don't belong here.

360
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. I know. You're right.

361
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have... I just...

362
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My whole life I dreamed of...

363
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:32,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I meant you don't belong here.\nI mean, in this room. This is my room.

364
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Property of Crane.

365
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. Right, right.

366
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, you want to get to sleep.

367
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah.\n- I'm keeping you up.

368
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got big things tomorrow.

369
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. You're awesome.\nLast thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.

370
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was that?

371
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't say anything.

372
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. All right. Good night.

373
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sleep well.

374
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That seemed a little awkward.

375
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master Tigress!\nI didn't mean to wake you.

376
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You don't belong here.\n- Yeah, of course.

377
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is your room.

378
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, you don't belong\nin the Jade Palace.

379
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a disgrace to kung fu,\nand if you have

380
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:21,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}any respect for who we are\nand what we do,

381
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you will be gone by morning.

382
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Big fan!

383
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:42,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see you have found the Sacred\nPeach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

384
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought\nit was just a regular peach tree.

385
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:54,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand.\nYou eat when you are upset.

386
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Upset? I'm not upset.\nWhat makes you think I'm upset.

387
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So why are you so upset?

388
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I probably sucked more today\nthan anyone in the history of kung fu.

389
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the history of China.\nIn the history of sucking!

390
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably.

391
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the Five! Man, you should've\nseen them! They totally hate me.

392
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Totally.

393
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How is Shifu ever going to turn me\ninto the Dragon Warrior?

394
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I'm not like the Five.

395
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got no claws, no wings, no venom.

396
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:35,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even Mantis has those... thingies.

397
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:40,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe I should just quit\nand go back to making noodles.

398
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Quit, don't quit.

399
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Noodles, don't noodles.

400
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are too concerned\nwith what was and what will be.

401
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a saying:

402
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yesterday is history,

403
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:01,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}tomorrow is a mystery,

404
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but today is a gift.

405
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is why it is called the present.

406
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, no!\n- What's happening?!

407
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!

408
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire crossbows!

409
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire!

410
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire!

411
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.

412
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not going anywhere! Neither is he!\n- Let go of me!

413
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring it up!

414
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! Bring it back!

415
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's coming this way!\n- He won't get far. Archers!

416
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're dead. So very, very dead.

417
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not yet we're not. Now!

418
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:43,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can we run now?\n- Yes.

419
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}(Commander is killed)

420
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm glad Shifu sent you.

421
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was beginning to think\nI'd been forgotten.

422
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fly back there and tell them...

423
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the real Dragon Warrior\nis coming home.

424
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good morning, Master!

425
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Panda!

426
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Panda!

427
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wake up!

428
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's quit.

429
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do we do now, with the panda gone?\nWho will be the Dragon Warrior?

430
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All we can do is resume our training\nand trust that in time,

431
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the true Dragon Warrior\nwill be revealed.

432
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing here?!

433
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi! Good morning, Master!

434
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought I'd warm up a little.

435
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're stuck.

436
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:07,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?

437
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nah. This is one of my...\nYeah, I'm stuck.

438
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Help him.\n- Oh, dear.

439
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe on three. One, two...

440
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...three.

441
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thank you.\n- Don't mention it.

442
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No, really, I appreciate...\n- Ever.

443
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:29,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You actually thought you could learn\nto do a full split in one night?

444
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It takes years to develop\none's flexibility!

445
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And years longer to apply it in combat!

446
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put that down!

447
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The only souvenirs we collect here are\nbloody knuckles and broken bones.

448
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:55,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah! Excellent.

449
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get started.

450
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Are you ready?\n- I was born re...

451
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, brother.\nI thought you said you were ready.

452
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was awesome! Let's go again!

453
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been taking it easy on you, panda.\nBut no more.

454
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your next opponent will be me.

455
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right! Yeah, let's go!

456
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Step forth.

457
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:51,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The true path to victory is to find\nyour opponent's weakness...

458
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and make him suffer for it.

459
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah!

460
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To take his strength\nand use it against him...

461
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...until he finally falls...

462
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...or quits.

463
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A real warrior never quits.

464
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:07,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry, Master. I will never quit!

465
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he's smart,\nhe won't come back up those steps.

466
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he will.

467
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not going to quit, is he?

468
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not going to quit bouncing,\nI'll tell you that.

469
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you said acupuncture\nwould make me feel better.

470
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Trust me, it will.

471
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:47,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just not easy finding the right\nnerve points under all this...

472
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Fat?\n- Fur. I was going to say fur.

473
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure you were.

474
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who am I to judge a warrior\nbased on his size? Look at me.

475
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm over here.

476
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you should look at this again.

477
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, OK.

478
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it. Stop!

479
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know Master Shifu is trying\nto inspire me and all...

480
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but if I didn't know better,\nI'd say he was trying to get rid of me.

481
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know he can seem kind of heartless...

482
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but he wasn't always like that.

483
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}According to legend,

484
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:32,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there was once a time when\nMaster Shifu actually used to smile.

485
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No!\n- Yes.

486
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But that was before.

487
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before what?

488
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before Tai Lung.

489
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not really supposed\nto talk about him.

490
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if he's going to stay here,\nhe should know.

491
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.

492
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:52,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was a student. The first ever to\nmaster the thousand scrolls of kung fu.

493
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:56,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then he turned bad,\nand now he's in jail.

494
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wasn'tjust a student.

495
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shifu found him as a cub...

496
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and he raised him as his son.

497
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when the boy showed\ntalent in kung fu...

498
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:19,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Shifu trained him.

499
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:23,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He believed in him. He told him\nhe was destined for greatness.

500
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was never enough for Tai Lung.

501
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wanted the Dragon Scroll.

502
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:35,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Oogway saw darkness\nin his heart and refused.

503
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Outraged, Tai Lung\nlaid waste to the valley.

504
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He tried to take the scroll by force.

505
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And Shifu had to destroy\nwhat he had created.

506
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But how could he?

507
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:10,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shifu loved Tai Lung\nlike he had never loved anyone before.

508
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or since.

509
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now he has a chance\nto make things right.

510
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To train the true Dragon Warrior.

511
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he's stuck with you.

512
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:40,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A big fat panda\nwho treats it like a joke.

513
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is it!

514
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! My fault!\nI accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

515
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And may have also stopped his heart.

516
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inner peace.

517
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inner peace.

518
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inner...

519
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inner peace.

520
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:15,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would whoever is making\nthat flapping sound quiet down?!

521
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Inner...

522
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Zeng.

523
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excellent.

524
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could use some good news right now.

525
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master! Master!

526
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:43,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have... It's...\nIt's very bad news.

527
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shifu.

528
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:49,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is just news.\nThere is no good or bad.

529
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master, your vision.\nYour vision was right.

530
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tai Lung has broken out of prison.\nHe's on his way.

531
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is bad news...

532
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:05,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...if you do not believe\nthat the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

533
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:10,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The panda? Master,\nthat panda is not the Dragon Warrior.

534
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wasn't meant to be here!\nIt was an accident.

535
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are no accidents.

536
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I know. You've said that already.

537
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:24,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Twice.\n- Well, that was no accident, either.

538
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:25,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thrice.

539
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My old friend,

540
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the panda will never fulfill\nhis destiny, nor you yours,

541
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:35,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}until you let go\nof the illusion of control.

542
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Illusion?

543
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:40,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

544
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I cannot make it blossom\nwhen it suits me,

545
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}nor make it bear fruit\nbefore its time.

546
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there are things we can control.

547
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can control when the fruit will fall.

548
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I can control...

549
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...where to plant the seed.

550
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is no illusion, Master.

551
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

552
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But no matter what you do

553
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that seed will grow to be a peach tree.

554
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:15,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You may wish for an apple or an orange,\nbut you will get a peach.

555
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

556
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe it can.

557
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you are willing to guide it.

558
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:27,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To nurture it.

559
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To believe in it.

560
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:31,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But how? How?

561
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:33,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need your help, Master.

562
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, you just need to believe.

563
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Promise me, Shifu.

564
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Promise me you will believe.

565
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will try.

566
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good.

567
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My time has come.

568
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:59,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must continue\nyour journey without me.

569
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you? Wait!

570
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master!

571
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't leave me!

572
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:13,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must believe.

573
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master!

574
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:49,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, so I'm like,\n"Fine, you may be a wolf,

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but you're a lousy tipper."

577
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? So how did you\nget out of there alive?

578
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I didn't actually say that...

579
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...but I thought it...

580
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...in my mind.

581
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he could read my mind,\nhe'd be, like, "What?"

582
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:10,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Order up! Hope you like it.

583
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is really good!\n- No, come on.

584
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup.\nHe actually knows the secret ingredient.

585
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean? This is amazing!

586
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're a really good cook.\n- I wish my mouth was bigger.

587

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tigress, you've got to try this.

588
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is said that the Dragon Warrior\ncan survive for months

589
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:35,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf\nand the energy of the universe.

590
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:41,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess my body doesn't know\nit's the Dragon Warrior yet.

591
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:46,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna need a lot more\nthan dew and universe juice.

592
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What?\n- Nothing... Master Shifu.

593
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never be the Dragon Warrior unless you\nlose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!

594
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is that noise you're making?\nLaughter? I never heard of it!

595
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Work hard, panda, and maybe someday...

596
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...you will have ears like mine.

597
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:13,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's good.

598
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:17,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ears. It's not working for you?\nI thought they were pretty good.

599
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:18,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Shifu!

600
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:21,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course it's Shifu.\nWhat do you think I'm doing?

601
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master Shifu!

602
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think this is funny?

603
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:32,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tai Lung has escaped\nand you're acting like children!

604
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:35,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What?\n- He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,

605
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you are the only one\nwho can stop him.

606
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I was saying\nyou got no sense of humor.

607
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung.

608
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? You're serious? And I have to?

609
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:53,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master Oogway will stop him,\nlike he did before.

610
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oogway cannot!

611
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not anymore.

612
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:01,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

613
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The panda?\n- Yes, the panda!

614
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master, let us stop Tai Lung.\nThis is what you've trained us for.

615
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:10,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! It is not your destiny\nto defeat Tai Lung.

616
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is his!

617
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:13,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where'd he go?

618
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:24,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You cannot leave!\nA real warrior never quits.

619
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Watch me.

620
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:29,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

621
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung?\nI can't even beat you to the stairs.

622
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will beat him\nbecause you are the Dragon Warrior.

623
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:40,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't believe that.\nYou never believed that.

624
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From the beginning,\nyou've tried to get rid of me.

625
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:46,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! I was.

626
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:51,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now I ask you to trust in your\nmaster as I have come to trust in mine.

627
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:56,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not my master.\nAnd I'm not the Dragon Warrior.

628
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:00,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then why didn't you quit?! You knew\nI wanted you gone, yet you stayed.

629
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I stayed.

630
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:06,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I stayed because every time\nyou threw a brick at my head

631
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:10,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or said I smelled, it hurt,\nbut it could never hurt more

632
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}than it did every day\nof my life just being me.

00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. I was getting a cookie.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think I'm a fool?

713
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:41,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you're not the Dragon Warrior.\nNone of you!

714

715
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:49,440

734
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:37,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, they're breathing. They're asleep?\nBut their eyes are open.

735
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We were no match for his nerve attach.

736

01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought we could stop him.

741
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:53,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He could have killed you.

742
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:54,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why didn't he?

743
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:58,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you could come back and strike fear\ninto our hearts. But it won't work.

744
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:03,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It might. I mean, a little.

745
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:04,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm pretty scared.

746
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:05,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can defeat him, panda!

747
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding? If they can't?!

748
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're five masters. I'm just one me.

749
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:15,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you will have\nthe one thing that no one else does.

750
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:23,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You really believe I'm ready?

751
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:25,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are...

752
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:26,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Po.

753
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:18,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Behold the Dragon Scroll.

754
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:20,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is yours.

755
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:23,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. What happens when I read it?

756
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:28,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Legend says you will be able\nto hear a butterfly's wing beat.

757
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Really? That's cool.

758
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.

759
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:36,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will feel the universe\nin motion around you.

760
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I punch through walls?

761
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Do a quadruple back flip?\n- Focus.

762
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:42,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Will I?\n- Focus.

763
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Focus.\n- Oh, yeah, yeah.

764
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny.

765
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:49,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Read it and become...

766
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the Dragon Warrior.

767
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:59,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's impossible to open.

768
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:03,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. Come on, baby. Come on now.

769
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:07,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

770
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I probably loosened it up\nfor you though.

771
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:12,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK, here goes.

772
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:26,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's blank.\n- What?!

773
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:29,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Here, look.\n- No, I am forbidden to look upon...

774
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:38,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blank. I don't...

775
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:40,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand.

776
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK. So, like...

777
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:48,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...Oogway was\njust a crazy old turtle after all.

778
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:50,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

779
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:54,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, come on! Face it,\nhe picked me by accident.

780
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:59,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior.\nWho am I kidding?

781
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:01,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But who will stop Tai Lung?

782
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll destroy everything and everyone.

783
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

784
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:11,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Evacuate the valley. You must protect\nthe villagers from Tai Lung's rage.

785
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:14,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What about you, Master?\n- I will fight him.

786
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:17,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What?\n- I can hold him off long enough

787
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:18,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for everyone to escape.

788
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:21,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, Shifu, he'll kill you.

789
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:24,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I will finally have paid\nfor my mistake.

790
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:27,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to me, all of you.

791
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:30,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is time for you to continue\nyourjourney without me.

792
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:33,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am very proud\nto have been your master.

793
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got to get them out safely.

794
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:59,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come, little one. Let's find your mama.

795
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:03,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Viper, gather the southern farmers.\nMantis, the north.

796
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:04,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crane, light the way.

797
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:26,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

798
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Dad.

799
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po!

800
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:46,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good to have you back, son.

801
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:50,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good to be back.

802
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:52,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go, Po.

803
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:58,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So for our next shop,\nit's time to face it...

804
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:01,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...the future of noodles\nis dice-cut vegetables...

805
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...no longer slices.

806
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:07,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Also, I was thinking, maybe this time

807
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:10,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll have a kitchen\nyou can actually stand up in.

808
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You like that?

809
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:24,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po, I'm sorry if things didn't work out.

810
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:27,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It just wasn't meant to be.

811
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po, forget everything else.

812
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:35,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your destiny still awaits.

813
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are noodle folk.\nBroth runs deep through our veins.

814
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:42,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know, Dad.

815
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:46,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honestly, sometimes\nI can't believe I'm actually your son.

816
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Po...

817
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:55,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...I think it's time I told you\nsomething I should have told you...

818
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:57,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...a long time ago.

819
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:59,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}OK.

820
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:05,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The secret ingredient\nof my Secret Ingredient Soup.

821

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come here. The secret ingredient is...

822
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:13,660

823
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:17,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You heard me. Nothing!

824
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is no secret ingredient!

825
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:23,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait.\nIt's just plain old noodle soup?

826
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:26,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't add some kind of special\nsauce or something?

827
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:30,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't have to. To make something\nspecial, you just believe it's special.

828
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:43,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is no secret ingredient.

829
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:09,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have come home, Master.

830
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is no longer your home.\nAnd I am no longer your master.

831
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:16,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yes. You have a new favorite.

832
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So where is this Po?

833
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did I scare him off?

834
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This battle is between you and me.

835
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:29,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, that is how it's going to be.

836
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is how it must be.

837
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:50,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I rotted in jail for 20 years\nbecause of your weakness!

838
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:52,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Obeying your master is not weakness!

839
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:55,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.

840
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You always knew.

841
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:03,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But when Oogway said otherwise,\nwhat did you do?

842
01:11:04,150 --> 01:11:06,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you do?!

843
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:10,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing!

844
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:13,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were not meant to be the Dragon\nWarrior! That was not my fault!

845
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:15,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not your fault?!
