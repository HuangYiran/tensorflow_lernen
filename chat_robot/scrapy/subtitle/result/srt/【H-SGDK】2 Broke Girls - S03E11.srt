1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,700
用时... 三十七分钟
And... time! 37 minutes.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,840
这可是我们从家出发
We got from the apartment to

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,940
上地铁 再到糕点学校的最快记录了
the subway to the pastry school in record time.

4
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:13,181
不过得说 我可是没穿胸罩 丁字裤也反穿了
I mean, I'm not wearing a bra and my thong may be on backwards.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,160
丁字裤只要穿得舒服
There's no wrong way to wear a thong,

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,200
理它分前及后
as long as it's uncomfortable.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,300
还有 你的胸罩只是装饰而已
And with you, the bra's just for decoration.

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,500
我穿着是因为
I have to wear one 'cause you get

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,200
你没把孩子放进安全座椅而被发票了
a ticket for not putting the kids in a car seat.

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,100
课上见 伙计们 我要和咱家亲耐滴老婆道个别
See you in class, guys. I gotta say good-bye to my wife.

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,120
- 你还真以为我会亲你  - 是滴
- Did you think I was gonna kiss you? - Yes!

12
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,920
我是老婆 你是我老公啊
I'm the wife, you're the husband,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,360
你还被我抓到穿着我的衣服
who I caught wearing my clothes one day,

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,540
我可是忍气吞声了
but I don't say anything about it...

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,460
- 早啊 姑娘们  - 哦 Bebe
- Morning, guys. - Oh, hi, Bebe.

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,280
很惊讶看到我 是吧
Surprised to see me, right?

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,680
所有人都以为我活不过昨晚了
Everyone always thinks I'm not gonna make it through the night,

18
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,800
不过 姐就在这呢 连我都觉得不可思议
but here I am, even surprised myself.

19
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,600
和随时可能领便当的人
What's it like working in an office

20
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,420
一起工作的滋味如何
with someone who's about to snap like a breadstick?

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,180
没你想的般有趣
Not as much fun as you'd think.

22
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,580
不过Bebe人不错的
But Bebe's sweet, and working

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,040
而且这工作能供你在糕点学校毕业
here is putting you through pastry school.

24
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,640
- 好的 再见  - 再见
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

25
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,700
- 我要离婚  - 我已提交文件了
- I want a divorce. - I already filed.

嘿 老婆 我要五块钱赔我昨天用坏的刮铲
Hey, wife, I need $5 to pay for a spatula I broke yesterday.

31
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,100
我那时候化身Gordon Ramsay模式了
I was having a Gordon Ramsay moment.

32
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,040
我还想和他打了一炮呢
I'd have sex with him, by the way.

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,000
怎么 他对你大叫
Why? He'd just be yelling

34
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,800
说你的煮法不对
at you and telling you you're doing it wrong.

35
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,180
是啊 做爱不都如此
Yeah, sex.

36
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,360
拿吧 在我钱包里
Take it. It's in my purse.

37
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,560
嘿 Bebe 你有吃余的药吗
Yo, Bebe, you got any extra pills you're not taking?

38
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,780
不会的 我把药全吃了
No, I'm taking them all.

39
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,700
- 天啊 不会吧  - 什么 我只不过是想买一个 或者两个刮铲
- Oh, my God, no. - What? I just wanted one. Or two.

40
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:54,974
能给我撸一炮就好 我三点就要参加发泡奶油制作考试了
Just to take the edge off. I have a whipped cream final at 3:00.

41
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,460
不是了 是报纸上的讣告栏 我认识这个人
No. In the obituaries. I know this person.

42
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,220
"Antonia Florentino 享年八十岁 在睡梦中安详离去"
"Antonia Florentino, 80, died peacefully in her sleep."

43
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,600
是自杀的 是吧
That's a suicide, right?

44
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,680
她是我的保姆
She was my nanny.

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,680
你还在雇保姆
You still have a nanny?

46
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,620
真走运
Lucky...

47
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,920
她陪我度过了大部分的童年时光
She took care of me most of my childhood.

48
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,240
- 我很爱她  - 节哀
- I loved her so much. - So sorry...

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,760
让我想起了我的老邻居Carla
That's kind of how I felt about my old neighbor, Carla.

50
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,540
我是说 她倒没有照顾过我
I mean, she didn't take care of me,

51
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,660
我还是小孩子的时候 她让我用她的水管喝水
but when I was a kid, she used to let me drink out of her hose.

52
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,060
我最后一次见Antonia
The last time I saw Antonia, she was driving me

53
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,820
是她开车戴着邋遢的Nelly Furtado和我去青少年选择奖
and a sloppy Nelly Furtado to the Teen Choice Awards.

54
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,100
哦 上班还让哭了么
Oh, are we allowed to cry at work now?

55
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,520
我可是只敢在车里这么干
'Cause I only do it in my car.

56
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,840
Max 知道我怎么想的么
Max, you know what I just realized?

57
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,640
我的保姆去世后我还是第一次来这里呢
This is the first time I've been here since my nanny died.

58
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,740
你刚才在Chipotle也这么说
You just said that at Chipotle.

59
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,700
十分钟后你又说了一遍 还是在那里
And then you said it again ten minutes later, also at Chipotle.

60
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,440
有点人性好不好 我是为保姆的去世而伤心落泪
Show some sensitivity. I was crying because my nanny died.

61
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,640
而且我们那悼念的早午餐也是在那里吃的
And also because our grief brunch was at Chipotle.

62
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,020
Caroline 你的保姆去世了
Caroline, your nanny passed?

63
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,320
我很同情 宝贝 很遗憾
My sympathies, sweetheart. That's a shame.

64
00:03:16,493 --> 00:03:18,794
不过没什么比一个黑人葬礼爽了
But there is nothing better than a black funeral.

65
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,760
我还正处于84年爷爷葬礼后的宿醉呢
I'm still hung over from my grandpa's in '84.

66
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,280
Earl 我的保姆是个白人
Earl, my nanny was white.

67
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,360
你的保姆是个白人 妹纸你真曾是富人呢
Your nanny was white? Child, you were rich.

68
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,620
看见Han了吗
Have you seen Han?

69
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,000
葬礼明天在费城举行 我要请一天假
The funeral's in Philadelphia tomorrow, and I need the day off.

70
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,820
嗯 我刚才看见他了
Well, I think I saw him earlier,

71
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,460
不过可能是走眼了 那或许是只猫
but then again, it might have been a cat.

72
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,280
嘿 我俩都要请假
Hey, we both need the day off.

73
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,100
我要在精神上支持你
I'm going with you for moral support

74
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,800
而且我要吃人生第一份费城牛肉干酪三明治
my first cheese steak/ I want

75
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,300
我还要像麦粒般骑在独立钟上面爽一下
to ride the liberty bell like a wrecking ball.

76
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,120
这是我在"科技新时代"上 读过有关白矮星 黑洞和天王星
I just read the craziest article in this Popular Science

77
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,700
最扯的文章了
about white dwarfs, black holes, and Uranus.

78
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,540
中坑了 重新再来
Oh, no. Let me start over.

79
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,480
Han 我们明天想请假
Han, we need tomorrow off.

80
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,600
我保姆去世了 她待我如女
My nanny died. She was like a mother to me.

81
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,480
不过她不是你妈妈 餐馆的规定是
But she was not your mother. And diner rules clearly state

82
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,740
你家人去世才能请假
you can only take off for the death of a family member.

83
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,520
是啊 规定也有"工作期间不许饮酒" 可你...
Well, the rules also say "No drinking on the job", but...

84
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,090
好吧 好 你们能去
Okay, yes, you can go.

85
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,790
因为在我们国家里 敬老是很重要的
Because in my culture, it's important to honor the elderly.

86
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,880
我22岁的时候还和一个97岁的老人共享一张双层床呢
I shared a bunk bed with a 97-year-old till I was 22.

87
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,700
你在上面还是下面
Were you on the top or the bottom?

88
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,620
哦 我总是在下面
Oh, I was always the bottom.

89
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,260
又中坑了 重新再来
Oh, no. Let me start over.

90
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,420
嘿 Caroline
Hey, Caroline.

91
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,760
我收到了你保姆去世的短信
I got your nanny death text.

92
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,140
所以我穿黑的以示尊敬
So I'm wearing black out of respect.

93
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,640
还有 我大姨妈来了
And also, I got my period.

94
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,900
- 谢谢 Sopie 你真好人  - 是吗 哪里
- Thanks, Sophie. That's lovely. - It is? Which part?

95
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,280
你看 还在波兰的时候 我的保姆去世了
You know, back in Poland when my nanny died,

96
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,220
我很伤心 我几乎都吃不下她
I was so heartbroken, I could barely eat her.

97
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,220
你把你去世的保姆吃掉了
You ate your dead nanny?

98
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,880
就是只山羊而已 怎称呼也没影响吧
Well, a goat's a goat. It doesn't matter what you name it.

99
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,820
那山羊肉还是很好吃的
It's still good goat meat.

100
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,780
好吧 我去卡位坐着了
All right, I'll be in my booth.

101
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:26,296
我要点一份金枪鱼三明治 三片Midol止疼片 谢啦
I'm going to order a tuna melt and three Midol, please.

102
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,420
等等 我们怎么去
Wait, how are we gonna get there?

103
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,000
哦 Bebe说她说自己有辆车 我们去找她吧
Oh, Bebe said she had a car, we can just ask her.

104
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,640
我才不要和她坐一辆车
I don't want to get in a car with her.

105
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,680
我都不想和她说话
I don't even want to get in a conversation with her.

106
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,660
我载你们去吧
I can drive you.

107
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:39,341
不过要去我姐姐那里一趟
We just have to stop at my sister's

108
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,540
她在Bucks县 取一个没有标记的包裹
in Bucks County, pick up an unmarked package,

109
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,540
送到康涅狄格州
and swing by Connecticut to drop it off.

110
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,840
Oleg 你送的东西有什么违禁品么
Oleg, is there anything illegal about this delivery?

111
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,900
没有 就是几双鞋...装了可卡因
No, it's just some shoes... Stuffed with cocaine.

112
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,280
鞋还是大麻做的
Also the shoes are made of hashish.

113
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
我还是给Bebe打电话吧
I'll call Bebe.

114
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,620
行 不过我要坐后座
Okay, but I'm sitting in the

115
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,220
要不就会被她传染成神经病了
back 'cause I don't want the crazy to get on me.

116
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,660
Bebe 你能载我们去葬礼 我都不知道该怎么感谢你了
Bebe, I can't thank you enough for driving us to the funeral.

117
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,460
我们才开20英里时速 你可以再开快点的
We're only going 20. You can go faster if you want.

118
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,960
是啊 我们都被树超过去了
Yeah, we just got passed by a tree.

119
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,870
我特别高兴你还带上了
And I'm especially thrilled your nervous cocker spaniel

120
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,920
你那放屁 患了热点病的神经质可卡犬
with gas and hot spots got to join us.

121
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:28,891
好吧 这下你开到100英里时速了
Okay, now you're going 100.

122
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,660
你可以开慢点的
We can go slower if you want.

123
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,260
不好意思 极端 我的风格
Sorry. Extremes... That's my thing.

124
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,620
有一次 我搬家去东京待了一天
One time I moved to Tokyo for a day.

125
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,860
Max 我又感到了
Max, it just hit me again.

126
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,260
我知道 闻着像是她给狗狗喂了花椰菜
I know. It's like she feeds him broccoli.

127
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,480
Antonia真的去世了
No. That Antonia is really dead.

128
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,840
好消息是 Yelp点评网上说
Well, the good news is, according to Yelp,

129
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,050
她葬礼的地方离著名的
she's dead about two blocks

130
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,640
费城牛肉干酪三明治店只有两个街区
from the famous Philly cheese steak place.

131
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,980
- Max 体面点  -  我又不认识她
- Max, show some respect. - Well, I didn't know her.

132
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,140
其实 我就知道
In fact, I only know her as the

133
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,040
她就是让我有机会吃到牛肉干酪三明治的女士
lady who brought me and cheese steaks together.

134
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,270
即便我们从未谋面
Even though we've never met, it'll mean so much

135
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,080
Antonia的家人看到我能去致哀 他们会感到有意义的
to Antonia's Family that I came out of respect.

136
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,760
对我的心理医生来说
It'll mean so much to my therapist

137
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,420
我能只带着一只狗狗就脱离心理安全区 这也很有意义
that I left my safe zone and only brought one of the dogs.

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,620
Max 你觉得我在悼词里加上
Max, do you think in addition to my eulogy,

139
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,880
一些我小时候的日记如何
I should read something from my childhood journal?

140
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,300
我不建议 但你还是会一意孤行的
I don't, but I think you're gonna do it anyway.

141
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,270
"1997年的圣诞节清晨"
"Christmas morning, 1997.

142
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,740
"Antonia用一杯热可可"
"Antonia woke me up with a cup of hot cocoa"

143
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,820
"还有我最爱吃的薄荷棒糖叫醒我 然后我们就去打开礼物"
"And my favorite peppermint stick, and then we opened presents."

144
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,180
1997年的圣诞节清晨
Christmas morning, 1997.

145
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,080
我泼了我妈妈一脸的冷水
I threw cold water on my mother's face.

146
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,160
到了新年那天 她纹风不动
New Year's day... Still no movement.

147
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,200
这张照片是我留下来唯一一张和她的合影
This is the only picture I still have of us.

148
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,580
第一个一起过的万圣节 那时我才四岁
It was our first Halloween together. I was four.

149
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,020
看看这是她给我做的小鸡服装
Look at that cute little baby chick costume she made me.

150
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,840
- 哇 真可爱  - 看着点路
- Aw, so cute. - Car.

151
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,520
我从来就没穿过万圣节服装
I never had a Halloween costume.

152
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,820
我曾经梳着凌乱发髻
I used to put my hair in a messy bun

153
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,380
然后走路蹒跚挨家挨户的敲门假扮我妈
and stumble from door-to-door telling people I was my mother.

154
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,860
这个万圣节 我打扮我的医生Michael
This Halloween, I went as my doctor, Michael.

155
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,940
我把这小狗狗打扮成他的恋人Joseph
And I dressed up my buddy here as his lover, Joseph.

156
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:07,042
我们一时情迷意乱了
We lost.

157
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,600
Antonia一直守护着我
Antonia was always there for me...

158
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,120
万圣节 圣诞节 复活节 每个节日都在我身边
Halloween, Christmas, Easter... Every holiday.

159
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,460
每一天
Really, every day.

160
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,260
她就像我的妈妈
She was really like a mother to me.

161
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,000
那你亲妈去哪儿了
Where was your real mother?

162
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,783
哟 你这狗除了有着悲伤基因以外算什么品种
Hey, what kind of dog is that? I mean, besides "Sad"?

163
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,680
她娘红杏出墙 被她爹休了
Her mother had an affair, got pushed out.

164
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,200
这是她的伤心往事 你别再提了
That's her hot spot, so don't lick it.

165
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,400
没事的 Max 我已经不需要保护了
It's okay, Max, I don't need any protection.

166
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,700
你不需要保护
You don't need protection?

167
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,520
你以为你是我前男友们啊
Who are you, every guy I've ever dated?

168
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,680
Bebe 是的 我妈妈对我爸爸不忠 然后被赶出了家门
Bebe, yes, my mother was unfaithful to my father, so she was sent away.

169
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,280
但是我身边还有Antonia 她一直在照顾我
But I had Antonia and she took care of me.

170
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,440
她就是我的家人
She was my family.

171
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,940
你人生太苦逼了 每个人都需要个妈
That must have been hard. Everybody needs a mother.

172
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,820
如果我妈不在的话我得疯了
I'd be crazy without my mother.

173
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,600
每次她都会开车戴我去看医生
She drives me to all my appointments.

174
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,280
但现在你在开车
But you drive.

175
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,200
是啊
Yeah...

176
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,000
但是我不该开的
But I'm not supposed to.

177
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
我让Bebe在车里等没什么问题吧
It's okay I asked Bebe to wait in the car, right?

178
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,440
她会好好的对吧 我们还给她开了扇车窗
I mean, she'll be okay. We cracked a window.

179
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,180
恩 她有个碗及咀嚼玩具
Yeah, and she's got a bowl and a chew-toy.

180
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,040
快 我们来登记
Come on, let's sign in.

181
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,850
Max 当我见到她家人的时候 我得振作起来
Max, I have to keep it together when I meet the family.

182
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,340
我不能太情绪化
I can't be all emotional.

183
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,420
看 我手还在抖 真可怕
Look, my hand's shaking. This is terrible.

184
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,360
怎么了 我签的不好嘛
What? It was a terrible signature.

185
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,840
而且这张纸上只有五个名字而已
And there were only five other names on the page.

186
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,440
把它处理掉
Get rid of it.

187
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,100
把它处理掉
"Get rid of it"?

188
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,000
你以为你是我前男友们啊
Who are you, every guy I've ever dated?

189
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,100
Caroline Channing
"Caroline Channing."

190
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,040
给你 Max
Here, Max.

191
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,300
喔 看
Oh, look.

192
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,060
这鲜花还有这里的一切是多么美
The flowers and everything are so beautiful.

193
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,300
写好了
There you go.

194
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,700
你竟然签了"费城.牛肉干酪三明治"
You signed "Phil E. Cheese Steak"?

195
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,820
你跟我说别老提着 所以我就写下来当个提醒
You told me not to mention it anymore, so it's just a reminder.

196
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,960
好吧 Max 这里会有许多想跟我攀谈的人
Okay, Max, there are gonna be a lot of people

197
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,180
所以你要耐心一点
who will want my attention, so please be patient

198
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,372
站在我旁边 偶尔给点精神上的依靠
and stand next to me for the occasional supportive lean.

199
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,030
如果有人开始涕泗横流
And if someone starts to get too weepy,

200
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,100
你赶紧把他们拉开 因为我这件儿衣服可不能沾上眼泪
push them out of the way because I can't get tears on this dress.

201
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,840
我得明天早上9点前把它还回Barneys
It has to be back to Barneys by 9:00 A.M.

202
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,420
- 你来了  - 做好准备 Max
- You're here. - Here we go, Max.

203
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
其实我在跟他说话
I was talking to him.

204
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,800
那必须 真是个悲伤的日子
Of course you were. It's a very sad day for us all.

205
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,080
那真是乱来
That was rough.

206
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,100
喔 Max 看 这是Antonia
Oh. Max, look. This is Antonia.

207
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,900
- 哇 她看起来很和蔼可亲  - 是的
- Wow. She looks really nice. - She was.

208
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,200
我不知道她曾经参加过军队
I didn't know she was in the military.

209
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,160
这倒能够解释那些整齐床单的由来
But it does explain those fabulous bed sheet corners.

210
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,510
等一下 你不知道你保姆曾经是个陆战队
Wait, you didn't know your nanny was a marine?

211
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,180
真不幸 如果我知道我就会说
That's too bad, 'cause I'd be all,

212
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,960
"哟 有钱的小不点们 老子的保姆能折断你们的脖子"
"Yo, other little rich kid! My nanny can snap your neck."

213
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,920
喔 看 这是她的妹妹 Cecelia和Angela
Oh, look. There are her sisters, Cecelia and Angela,

214
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,380
还有她可爱的侄子和侄女
and there are her nieces and nephews.

215
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,980
但是竟然没有我
And there is not me anywhere.

216
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,900
我的照片一定是和其他的VIP照片一起放在棺材里
You know, my picture must be in the coffin with the other V.I.P.S.

217
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,480
如果你是VIP的话 能给我们拿瓶酒吗
If you're a V.I.P., can we get some bottle service?

218
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,340
女士们下午好 我是Anthony Antonia的侄子
Good afternoon, ladies. I'm Anthony, Antonia's Nephew.

219
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,080
- 真是太悲伤了 不是吗  - 是的
- It's sad day, huh? - Yes, it is.

220
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,900
- 我想我能得到些许安慰了  - 拿开你的咸猪手 Anthony
- Think I just got a little less sad. - Oh! Anthony!

221
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,210
快停下 我们是一家人 我是Caroline Channing
Stop. We're family. I'm Caroline Channing.

222
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,320
我只知道你是 性感Caroline
You're Caroline "Hot," Is all I know.

223
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,700
你们需要信封装钱吗 还是你们无所谓
You ladies need cash envelopes or you guys cool?

224
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,200
我总是需要装满现金的信封
I always need a cash envelope.

225
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,520
不好意思 为什么需要信封
I'm sorry, envelopes for what?

226
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,060
在意大利文化中守丧时 哀悼者需要
Well, at Italian wakes, the mourners give the family

227
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,020
在拜谒过亡者之后给家属一定的捐款
a donation after they view the deceased.

228
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,300
按次计费
So it's pay-per-view?

229
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,180
哇 你戳中了我的笑点
That was a good one.

230
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,100
嗨 你们一会儿想一块喝杯嘛
Hey, you want to go get a pop later?

231
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,460
我们一会儿就走 但是Anthony
We're leaving right after, but yes, Anthony.

232
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,680
我们需要个信封
Thank you. We'll take an envelope.

233
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,240
好吧 走过去就能看到她了
All right.The body's right through there.

234
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,280
- 向前走  - Anthony 住手
- Go right ahead. - Anthony, stop.

235
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,090
我很紧张 以前还从没见过死人
I'm really nervous. I've never seen a dead body before.

236
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,600
我见过一堆 我还跟几个之死有关
I've seen a bunch. A couple of them were my fault.

237
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,400
我没有现金 你有吗
I don't have any cash. Do you have any money?

238
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,460
我来看看
Let me check my wallet.

239
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,960
这可是真正的密封塑料袋 可不是山寨货
This is a real Ziploc, not one of those knock-offs.

240
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,600
把信封封好
Make sure you seal the envelope,

241
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,980
大家就都会以为里边装的都是25美分硬币
so people think it's all quarters.

242
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,220
Max 马上就到我们了 我有点害怕 牵着我的手
Max, we're next. I'm afraid. Hold my hand.

243
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,180
牵你的手 我们是约会网里第五次约会的情侣吗
Hold hands? What are we? On a Christian mingle fifth date?

244
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,340
拜托了 Max我有点紧张
Please, Max. I'm nervous.

245
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,560
- 喔 老天  - 谢谢你
- Oh, God. - Thank you.

246
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,700
好 放手
Okay. Now give it back.

247
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,840
怎么了 那已经是我最长的关系了
What? That was just my longest relationship.

248
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,980
另外 我需要我的手来把硬币装进信封
Plus, I need it to put this change in the envelope.

249
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,380
喔 她看起来是多么慈祥
Oh, she looks so peaceful.

250
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,660
嗨 Antonia 我是Caroline
Hi, Antonia. It's me, Caroline.

251
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,180
我要亲亲她吗 这个家的人都在看着呢
Should I kiss her? The family is right there watching.

252
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,540
在我们之前的女士亲了她
The lady before us kissed her.

253
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,840
上吧 她看起来不会打你
Go for it. Doesn't look like she'd fight you.

254
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,480
好的 从一数到三
Okay, on the count of three.

255
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,320
一 二
One, two...

256
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,540
Max 快来牵着我的手 我要
No! Max, hold my hand again while I...

257
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,340
我们该怎么办
What do we do?

258
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,730
手拿开 这些无论如何都得留下
Wait, leave it! We were giving it to them anyway.

259
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,860
也别全留下啊 这些是我们买牛肉干酪三明治的钱
Not all of it. That's our cheese steak money.

260
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,500
留下 走吧
Leave it. Come on.

261
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,520
真的很不好意思
I am so, so sorry about that.

262
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,860
我太紧张了 希望你理解
My nerves got the best of me. You understand.

263
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,180
- 我是Cecelia Antonia  - 的妹妹 我知道
- I'm Cecelia, Antonia??... - Sister. I know.

264
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,160
你们俩长得很像 我是Caroline
I see the resemblance. I'm Caroline.

265
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,760
姓什么
Caroline who?

266
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,160
Caroline Channing
Oh. Caroline Channing.

267
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,380
Caroline Channing是谁
Caroline Channing who?

268
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,520
我很理解 你现在在度过一个很困难的时刻
You're having a hard time processing. Understandable.

269
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,360
今天真的带给我们很大的冲击
It's been a very emotional day for us all.

270
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,000
这个女孩是谁 你 我觉得我好像在哪见过你
Who is this girl? You, I feel like I've seen somewhere.

271
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,940
你是Ricky那住在罗彻斯特的女人吗
Are you Ricky's girl from Rochester?

272
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,680
也许是 怎么了
I could be. What's in it for me?

273
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,420
Antonia在我小时候一直照顾我
Antonia used to take care of me when I was little.

274
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,440
哦 Antonia是你的临时保姆
Oh, Antonia was your baby-sitter.

275
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,420
很感谢你的到来
Very nice of you to come.

276
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,440
她不止是我的临时保姆
Well, she was hardly my "Baby-sitter."

277
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,960
十年来的日日夜夜都是她在照顾着我
She took care of me every day for ten years.

278
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,340
Caroline Caroline Channing
Caroline. Caroline Channing.

279
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,360
不好意思 宝贝 我真的不认识你
I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are, sweetheart,

280
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,520
即使你一再强调地提示我
though it seems to be what you're hammering me about.

281
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,920
不好意思 我想抽根烟
If you'll excuse me, I need a cigarette.

282
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,110
我还得把那些硬币从我姐姐身上拿开
And then I got to remove some of those pennies off of my sister.

283
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,600
这个是棺材 不是许愿池
It's a coffin, not a wishing well.

284
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,960
这个葬礼变得好沉重
This funeral turned out to be very depressing.

285
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,320
是啊
Well, yeah.

286
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,660
房间里的死人 真扫兴
Dead body in the room, generally a buzz-kill.

287
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,180
除非是一个爱尔兰式的葬礼
Unless it's an Irish wake...

288
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,820
你就可以在棺材旁边玩啤酒桌球赛了
Then you're playing beer pong off the coffin.

289
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,480
不 我是说 为什么这个家的人居然会不认识我
No, I mean, how is it possible that the family doesn't know me?

290
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,740
难道Antonia没跟她们提过我
Did Antonia never even mention me?

291
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,760
我们往好的方面想 Antonia很喜欢你的翘臀
Let's focus on the positive. Anthony really liked your ass.

292
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,380
我就知道Antonia和我拥有的是什么了
I know what Antonia and I had.

293
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,520
就是这
This is what we had.

294
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,680
啾啾 这就是我们拥有的
Peep, peep. That's what we had.

295
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,220
好吧 还真多
Well, that's a lot.

296
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,580
但是我觉得这家人
But I guess no one in this family

297
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,280
没人想承认这个事情 真遗憾
wants to admit that, and it's a shame too,

298
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,760
我的悼词很美
because I had a great eulogy.

299
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,220
真的吗
You do?

300
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,340
那当然 你想听听吗
Yes. I do. Would you like me to share it with you?

301
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,954
乐意之极
I most certainly would.

302
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,880
你不是真的要给那位老女人念悼词吧
You are not seriously eulogy-bombing that old lady, are you?

303
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,580
她主动问我的悼词
She asked me about my great eulogy.

304
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,040
她都能有100岁了 她极有可能
She's a hundred. She probably

305
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,740
以为你说你有一个很棒的泌尿科医生
thought you said you had a great urologist.

306
00:15:48,634 --> 00:15:52,830
有笔没 我要记一下医生的名字
Do you have a pen? I'm getting the name of her doctor.

307
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,830
不 我没有说
No, ma'am, I didn't say,

308
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,080
泌尿科医生 我说的是 悼词 非常完美的悼词
"Urologist." I said, "Eulogy." A great eulogy.

309
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,740
为什么要写悼词
Why would you give the eulogy?

310
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,920
因为我是 Caroline Channing
Because I'm Caroline Channing.

311
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,280
- 谁  - Caroline Channing
- Who? - Caroline Channing.

312
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,960
我是Caroline Channing Antonia是我的保姆
Caroline Channing...? Antonia was my nanny.

313
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,660
我曾经非常富有
My family was rich,

314
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,560
但是 我父亲骗了大家的钱
but then my father robbed everyone,

315
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,380
我们变成了过街老鼠
and we became the scourge of society,

316
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,070
Mel Gibson在同一周发表了反犹太人宣言
overshadowed a little bit

317
00:16:21,071 --> 00:16:23,101
所以他的风头稍微盖过了我们一点点
by Mel Gibson hating the Jews that same week.

318
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,140
这下你想起来了吗
Surely, you remember?

319
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,480
宝贝 我甚至都不记得我是怎么到这儿的
Honey, I don't even remember how I got here.

320
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,020
我不相信
I can't believe this.

321
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,120
我努力为自己创造一个幸福的童年的故事
I constructed my entire "Happy" Childhood

322
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,940
尽管事实上
on the fact that even though

323
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,920
我母亲离开了我 而且她根本不爱我
my mom left and apparently didn't love me,

324
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,160
但我认为Antonia是爱我的
Antonia did.

325
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,250
可我来到了这儿
And now I get here and I

326
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,640
然后忽然意识到 根本没有人爱我
我在她眼中只是张付薪水支票
realize no one loved me, I was just a paycheck.

327
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,720
我就是她众多照料的孩子中的一个而已
One of the many kids she baby-sat.

328
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,880
我都不知道我为什么要来
I don't even know why I bothered to come.

329
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,340
我要去卫生间呆会儿 然后我们就走吧
I'm gonna go to the restroom and then we can just leave.

330
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,520
不好意思 嗨
Excuse me. Hi.

331
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,900
我是Max Ricky的女人
Max, Ricky's girl.

332
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,440
我知道这段时间对你来说很痛苦
I know this is a hard time for you,

333
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,420
但是对我的朋友来说也一样
but it's a hard time for my friend as well.

334
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,160
尽管 可能你从来都没听说过她
And even though you never heard of her,

335
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,460
但你可不可以走过去
I was wondering if you could just go over there,

336
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,720
然后告诉她 你刚刚记起她了
and say you just remembered her,

337
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,360
其实Antonia一直都有和你们提到过她
and that Antonia talked about her all the time?

338
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,380
我知道你得推翻说过的话 而且还是个谎言
I know it's a 180 on your original story and a lie,

339
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,560
我愿意付钱解忧
and I'd offer to pay you for your trouble,

340
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,140
但是我的退休金都掉进那个棺材里 你姐姐身上了
but my 401k is laying in that box on top of your sister.

341
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,740
听着 我之所以让你们两个呆在这里
Look, I only permitted you two to stay

342
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,330
完全是因为Joe叔叔去年从房顶上掉下来之后
'cause your Ricky was so nice to Uncle Joe

343
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,080
Ricky对他一直都很好
when he fell off the roof last year.

344
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,960
但是现在 你赶紧滚
But now, you gotta go.

345
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,300
好吧 没问题
Okay. Be that way.

346
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,680
但是不要指望Ricky会带Joe叔叔去做透析
But don't expect Ricky to pick up Uncle Joe for dialysis.

347
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,700
Max 你干嘛呢
Max, what are you doing?

348
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,240
那家人让我把照片放上 他们刚刚想起来你了
The family asked me to put it up. They just remembered you.

349
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,840
天啊
Oh, my God.

350
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,289
我太可悲了
I'm so pathetic, you have

351
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,300
你为了让我感觉好过一点 而把我的照片放上去
to put up my picture to make me feel better?

352
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,800
从某种角度来说 是的
In a way, yes.

353
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,580
它就是属于这里的 怎么会有人不想认识这个孩子呢
It belongs up there. Who wouldn't want to know that kid?

354
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,960
很高兴认识你 Antonia 但是就请不要来我们家串门了
Nice to meet you, Antonia. Please don't haunt us.

355
00:18:11,241 --> 00:18:13,207
现在 我们该出发了 去吃一些好吃到爆的牛肉干酪三明治
Now, let's hit the road and get some freaking cheese steaks!

356
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,370
Max 把那个拿下来吧 太让人难为情了
Max, please take that down. It's so embarrassing.

357
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,180
在这儿 没有人认识我
Nobody here knows anything about me.

358
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,700
他们也不认识我 小鸡仔
They didn't know me either, chicken.

359
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,460
嘿 你叫谁小鸡仔呢
Hey, who you callin' chicken?

360
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,420
是我 那是Antonia给我起的昵称
Me. That was Antonia's Nickname for me.

361
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,680
- 你知道我是谁  - 当然
- You know who I am? - Of course I do.

362
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,540
Antonia的小鸡仔 唧唧叫的小鸡仔
Antonia's little chick, her peep.

363
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,820
她是爱你的
She loved you.

364
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,660
她做那套服装时也很高兴
And she loved making you that costume.

365
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,280
把整个厨房餐桌都弄得都是闪片
Took the whole kitchen table up with all those sequins,

366
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,700
她知道你值得光耀照人
but she knew you deserved to sparkle.

367
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,280
她非常非常爱你 让我都没法抱怨
She loved you so much, I couldn't begin to complain.

368
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,140
很抱歉 你叫什么
I'm so sorry. What was your name?

369
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,480
Meg O'Hara 我是她的室友
I'm Meg O'Hara. I was her roommate.

370
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,140
和爱人
And lover.

371
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,560
我们在一起30年了
We were together 30 years.

372
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,380
陆战队那张照片中的人是你
The military!

373
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,160
我晓 这不明显吗
I know, right? I mean, come on.

374
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,220
在坦克前面 我的手环抱着她的肩膀
That's me with my arm around her on that tank.

375
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,480
可是她家族里的人还傻傻的不知道
And the family still had no clue.

376
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,460
拉拉历史的先驱 太酷了
Vintage lez... Very cool.

377
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,480
我知道 Toni一定想让你保留这些东西
I know Toni would have wanted you to have these.

378
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,000
感谢你能来 小鸡仔
Oh, thanks for coming, chicken.

379
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,440
你可能是这个世界上唯一一个
You're probably the only person in the world

380
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,980
和我一样 全身心爱着她的人
who loved her as purely as I did.

381
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,660
Max 看哪
Max, look.

382
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,060
圣诞节
Christmas.

383
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,320
我的生日
And my birthday.

384
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,460
美国青少年选择奖
And the Teen Choice Awards.

385
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,260
节哀顺变
I'm sorry for your loss.

386
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,380
谢谢
Thank you.

387
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,500
大家一起来享用费城牛肉干酪三明治吧
Philly cheese steaks for everybody!

388
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,520
和9件牛肉干酪三明治以及一只
And you really haven't lived

389
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,300
会放屁的狗狗一起待在雪佛兰里
until you've driven two hours in a Chevy

390
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,380
两个小时过后 这才算是活了过来
with nine cheese steaks and a gassy animal.

391
