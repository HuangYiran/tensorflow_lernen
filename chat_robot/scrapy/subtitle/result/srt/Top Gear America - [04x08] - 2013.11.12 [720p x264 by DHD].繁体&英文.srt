翻譯   淳屌絲   socoollike

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,843
當你聽到超跑這個詞 你常常會想到歐洲
When you think supercars, you tend to think European.

6
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:15,013
但不久之前 可不是這樣的
But not so long ago, it was a different story.

7
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:21,020
請原諒我臉上的誇張笑容
Please excuse the gigantic grin on my face right now

8
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,189
因為我現在駕駛的是...
because I am driving a car

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,026
我兒時夢寐以求的車子
I dreamed of just getting close to my entire childhood...

10
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:33,266
極速240邁、純美國製造的Vector W8
The 240-mile-per-hour all-American Vector W8.

11
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:37,603
1990年問世 W8是第一台能夠與...
Born in 1990, the W8 was the first U.S. supercar that could compete

12
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,039
蘭博基尼和法拉利之流競爭的美國車
with the likes of Lamborghini and Ferrari.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,911
這輛車的發佈對美國有著重大意義
It was so big for America to come out with a car like this...

14
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,513
它告訴歐洲人 "你知道 我們不怕你"
To tell the Europeans, "you know, we're not afraid.

15
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,015
我們也能造超跑 甚至比你們更好"
We can do this, and we can do it even better."

16
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,617
但它馬上就沒落了
And then it was gone.

17
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,986
發生了什麼
So, what happened?

18
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:57,423
為什麼沒有美國超跑
Why is there no American supercar?

19
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:01,928
W8在1993年工廠倒閉後就停產了
W8 production stopped in 1993 after the company faltered,

20
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:04,113
只生產了19台
and only 19 were ever made.

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,901
看上去美國的超跑夢破滅了
It seemed like the American supercar dream was dead.

22
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,803
但在美國其他地方
But across the country,

23
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,106
一些小手工作坊讓夢想繼續延續
a few boutique manufacturers have kept the dream alive.

24
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,642
為了看看這些土生土長的超跑究竟如何
So to find out how good these homegrown supercars are,

25
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,077
我們每人挑選了一輛
we each chose our favorite

26
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,113
駕駛它們與歐洲競爭者進行測試
and put them to the test against their European rivals.

27
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,816
我去
Holy...

28
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:46,339
Top Gear讓我們駕駛美國超跑...
"Top Gear" told us to drive our American supercars

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,342
前往加州馬利布市的起點處
to the starting point in Malibu, California.

30
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,776
為了看看誰選的車最好
To see who had the best one,

31
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,645
我們將完成一系列挑戰
we'd be competing in challenges,

32
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:53,980
拉特的第一個挑戰是...
and Rut's first challenge

33
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,649
從他的車裏爬出來
was just to get out of the damn car.

34
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,151
你還好嗎 老爹
You all right, big daddy?

35
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,753
- 搞定   - 好的
- Got it! - Okay.

36
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,055
搞定
Got it.

37
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,223
我們需要那種椅子
We could get, like, one of those chairs

38
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,858
可以把人抬起來
that gets people up the stairs.

39
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,177
對 就像他們把海豚...
Yeah. You know, like, when they move the big dolphins

40
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,495
從一個水族館挪到另一個
from one aquarium to the other.

41
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:10,513
對 像吊床一樣的東西
Yeah, like a cradle thing.

42
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,997
向它背上灑水
You just squirt water on his back.

43
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,933
- 保持濕潤   - 對 把它拉過來
- Keep him moist. - Yeah, pull him around there.

44
00:02:14,017 --> 00:02:18,704
我剛剛駕駛了一輛薩林S7 你敢相信？
Can you believe that I'm driving a Saleen S7?

45
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,307
它大概有10歲了
It might have been 10 years old,

46
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:25,277
但對我來說 S7是完美的美國超跑
but, to me, the S7 is the perfect American supercar...

47
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,314
自然吸氣的V8爆發出650匹馬力
Naturally aspirated V8, 650-horsepower,

48
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:34,387
四分之一英里用時10秒 2003年的售價為三十七萬五千美元
10-second quarter mile, and $375,000 back in 2003.

49
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,855
它那賽車式的設計...
And its racecar design

50
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:39,492
讓它在160邁時有足夠的下壓力
means that it creates enough downforce at 160 miles an hour,

51
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,328
相當於它自身重量 它可以翻過來開
creates its weight... It could drive upside down.

52
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,896
試試看啊 我可不相信
- Do it. - I don't believe you.

53
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,331
我聽過很多次了
I've heard that stat so many times

54
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:46,666
但沒人能做到
about so many amazing cars, and nobody's done it.

55
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,100
我跟你們講
Let me tell you something.

56
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,718
我把車翻過來開好多次了
I've been upside down in a car many times.

57
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,719
你不會想那樣做的
You don't want to do it.

58
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,054
那是什麼
What's that?

59
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,422
- 我好像見過那台車   - 是的
- I feel like I've seen that car before. - You have.

60
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,741
我選擇了羅森Q1
I've chosen the Rossion Q1.

61
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,510
羅森公司買斷了noble M400的生產權
Rossion bought the rights to the noble M400,

62
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,846
把它變得更高端大氣上檔次
added luxury and refinement, but still kept

63
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,115
仍保留了賽車的功重比
the power-to-weight ratio of a track car.

64
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,618
只要十萬美元 你就能得到一輛擁有450匹馬力、
For 100 grand, you get 450 horsepower in a car

65
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,421
總重不到2500磅的車子
that weighs less than 2,500 pounds.

66
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,256
- 你死定了   - 我死定了？
You are dead. I'm dead?!

67
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,558
你還開那輛呢
You're driving that.

68
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,543
這是Lucra 你們所見到的...
This is a Lucra. Gentlemen, what you're looking at

69
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,463
是美國工藝的代表作
is a manifestation of American ingenuity.

70
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,214
連擋風都沒有
Without a windshield.

71
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,267
對 在手冊上沒看到 但問題不大
Yeah, I didn't see that in the brochure, but it's cool.

72
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,971
雖然我的Lucra LC470沒有車頂
Sure, my Lucra LC470 didn't have a roof,

73
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:30,776
但它有一台7升的V8引擎爆發出500多匹馬力
but it did have a 7-liter v8, generating over 500 horsepower,

74
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,928
而車子只有兩千磅重
the car weighing just 2,000 pounds,

75
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:36,315
售價只要十三萬五千美元
and all that for just 135 grand.

76
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,382
酷斃了
This is pretty cool.

77
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,117
這就是一台酷酷的Miata
It's a cool-looking Miata, though.

78
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,436
它一點也不像Miata
This looks nothing like a Miata.

79
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,588
我喜歡在側排氣管上的商標
I like that it has the logo here on the side pipes,

80
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,023
當你出來時
so that way, when you get out,

81
00:03:44,107 --> 00:03:48,127
就會把商標印在你的褲腿上
it'll brand the car's logo right on your calves.

82
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,263
不管是不是Miata 我們要出發了
Miata or not, it was time to start our journey.

83
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,567
我們要行駛100英里到達莫哈韋沙漠裏的...
We were told to head 100 miles to an automotive proving ground

84
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,985
一個汽車試驗場
in the Mojave desert.

85
00:03:56,103 --> 00:04:01,307
勝者將駕駛一輛三十萬美元的汽車
The winner would get his hands on a $300,000 dream car.

86
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,075
出發了 夥伴們
Mount up, gentlemen.

87
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,076
我們要去沙漠了
We're heading to the desert.

88
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,294
你帶防曬霜了嗎
Do you have sunscreen in there?

89
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,879
不 我有車頂 還要防曬霜幹嘛
No, I got a roof. Why would I have sunscreen?

90
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,180
哈哈
Ha ha!

91
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,915
哦 我的老天啊
Oh, my goodness gracious.

92
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,151
每次 每次
Each time. Each time. Oh, wow.

93
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:20,459
在前往莫哈韋沙漠的路上 我們聽了一場...
As we headed to Mojave, we were given a lecture

94
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:23,596
關於"怎樣成為超跑"的演講
on what makes a supercar by the human fly.

95
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,931
它必須別具一格
It's got to be fairly exclusive.

96
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,166
它必須非常快
It's got to be very fast.

97
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,636
它必須由專注的駕駛員...
It's got to take a concentrated hand

98
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,571
來釋放它的動力
to extract the most out of it.

99
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,040
它的全部潛力...
And its performance potential

100
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:38,577
無法被大多數車手所激發
has to be out of reach for most drivers.

101
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:42,148
它還要做的就是...
Oh, what it also needs to do is inspire

102
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,950
調動車手的情感
some sort of emotion from the driver.

103
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:49,922
能夠滿足一位汽車愛好者的熱情
It needs to feed the addiction that you have as a car enthusiast.

104
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,626
我之所以挑選這輛車是因為...
I picked this car because I really...

105
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,895
哦 好大一塊石頭
Ooh That was a big rock.

106
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,198
是因為我想知道...
I picked this car 'cause I really wanted to know

107
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,966
當它剛上市時...
if it could live up to all the hype

108
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,335
那些雜誌天花亂墜的宣傳是否屬實
that the magazines gave it when it first came out.

109
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,687
現在我得承認
Now, I'll admit,

110
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,406
這輛車的駕駛體驗非常扣人心弦
the driving experience of this car is really intense.

111
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,708
你得真正地去駕駛它
This is something that you really have to drive.

112
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,477
而不是隨隨便便地
You're not just kind of driving it.

113
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:15,214
這是一種緊張的駕駛過程
It is a full, intense driving session.

114
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,883
當拉特全神貫注時
While Rut was busy concentrating,

115
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,435
亞當有點困惑
Adam was getting confused.

116
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,320
當你抬起油門時
When you lift off the gas,

117
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:25,758
會發出這種排氣口的聲音
that's either the exhaust note burbling

118
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,560
或者是車子的顛簸聲
or the car's crumbling.

119
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,228
我不太確定
I'm not quite sure.

120
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,813
前往試驗場的路線
Our route to the proving grounds

121
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,733
要從洛杉磯穿越到比華利山
took us across Los Angeles to Beverly hills.

122
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,652
現在該進行第一個挑戰了
And it was time for the first challenge.

123
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,923
定義超跑的標準之一就是...
One of the defining features of supercars is their ability

124
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,209
能否擁有超高的回頭率
to turn heads with their stunning looks.

125
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,229
為了看看誰的回頭率最高
To find out which of ours stood out the most,

126
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,532
我們要把車停在羅迪歐大道上 看看誰的車子...
we had to park on rodeo drive and see which one of our cars

127
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,168
在十分鐘內被拍照的次數最多
had the most photographs taken in 10 minutes.

128
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,439
你嚇到小朋友了
You just scared a kid.

129
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,407
你剛剛嚇到小朋友了
You just scared a kid officially.

130
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,345
右邊的小孩跳了起來 摸了摸心臟
This kid to your right jumped. Bless his heart.

131
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,480
你還好嗎
Are you okay? You okay?

132
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,415
這是個嚇人的野獸 還能說什麼呢
It's a scary beast. What can I say?

133
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:27,152
延著街道前進 我們遇到了個競爭對手
But just down the street, we had some competition.

134
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,422
史上最偉大的超跑之一
It was one of the greatest supercars ever made...

135
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:34,927
一百七十萬美元的布加迪威龍SS
The $1.7 million Bugatti Veyron SS.

136
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,029
我們的車子要怎麼跟它比呢
How would our cars do up against that?

137
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,732
哇 那輛布加迪可真帥
Wow. I'll say that bugatti looks pretty good.

138
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,868
臭蟲小子先上
Bug boy was up first.

139
00:06:42,953 --> 00:06:45,437
好 這裏已經有一群人了
Okay, there's already a crowd formed here.

140
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,306
不敢相信
Unbelievable.

141
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,808
他需要主題樂 是嗎
He needs theme music, doesn't he?

142
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,011
他需要圍巾和皮頭盔
He needs a scarf and a leather helmet.

143
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,179
好 計時開始
Okay. Count it.

144
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,348
零七分了 他有十分鐘
It's 7 after. He's got 10 minutes.

145
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,684
他在幹嘛
What's he doing? What's he doing?

146
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,819
他來了
Here he comes. Here he comes.

147
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,121
很酷的護目鏡
Cool goggles.

148
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:03,622
很帥啊 你去滑雪了嗎
That's neat. Were you skiing?

149
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:04,873
哦 護目鏡
Oh. Goggles.

150
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,342
你剛滑雪回來嗎
Were you just snowboarding?

151
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,960
你做電焊多久了
How long have you been welding?

152
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:10,596
好 目前為止我看到八個人
All right, so thus far, I see eight people.

153
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,897
- 什麼   - 最多九個
What? Maybe nine.

154
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,566
你應該這麼數 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35...
Okay, you got to count by 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35...

155
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,135
停下
Stop it!

156
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,937
那是站著的人 不是拍照的人
Those are people standing, not people taking pictures.

157
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,438
只有八...九個人在拍照
There's only eight... there's nine people taking pictures.

158
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,522
那他們幹嘛站在那兒
Why are they standing there?

159
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,774
別的人站在那兒是因為...
The other people are just standing there

160
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,275
他們無法相信那玩意也能開到這兒
'cause they can't believe that that thing made it.

161
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,560
時間到
And that's time.

162
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,095
時間到了 就是這些
Time. That's it.

163
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,262
87個
87.

164
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,882
- 好吧 25個   - 25張照片
All right. 25. 25 pictures.

165
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:30,983
你以為很多了？
You think that's something,

166
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,317
等著我的薩林吧
wait till I pull the Saleen around.

167
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:33,786
好 去吧
Okay. Go.

168
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,922
薩林這麼帥的賽車造型
With the Saleen's racecar styling,

169
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,691
讓我很有信心
I was feeling confident.

170
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:48,000
那位女士好像在說 "需要我幫你出來嗎"
Look at... this other lady is like, "can I help you get out?"

171
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:49,852
他們在拍他摔倒的照片
They're taking a picture of him falling out.

172
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,572
他們在拍他的股溝
They just got a picture of his plumber crack.

173
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:55,507
你們好 你好
Hey, how you doing? Hey.

174
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,361
你知道嗎 目前唯一的照片...
You know, so far the only photograph

175
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,246
是你倒在地上的樣子
has been of you falling on the ground.

176
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:03,499
那...是...一個前滾翻
It was a tuck and roll.

177
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,085
我停車的時候就有兩個拍照了 那也算上
I got two as I was pulling in, so count that.

178
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:07,086
兩個？無所謂
Two? Whatever.

179
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,021
人群都涌向它
Look at them just flocking to it.

180
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,407
他們在想 "這是輛布加迪嗎"
They're thinking, "ooh, is this a bugatti?"

181
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,025
- 不   - 看 看
No. Look. Look.

182
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,927
他讓他的兒子與車合影了
He just got his son in the picture with him.

183
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,028
他又拍了一張
Oh, now he's going for the other.

184
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,147
六分鐘過後 我的薩林...
Six minutes in and my Saleen

185
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,383
像蜂蜜吸引蜜蜂一樣 吸引著人群
was drawing people in like bees to honey.

186
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,101
老實說 雖然我的照片更多
I would say that I had more photos,

187
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,987
但你的照片都是走到門前...
but your photos are actually going up to the door

188
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,121
與車合影
and taking a picture with it.

189
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,156
高質
Quality.

190
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,540
我的照片都是高質量的
I'm getting quality pictures right now.

191
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,975
可惜的是 這不算是挑戰的一部分
Too bad that wasn't part of the challenge.

192
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,077
- 停表吧   - 多少
Stop the clock. What's the time?

193
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:33,112
大概20個
That's like 20.

194
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:34,313
好 你是20個
Okay, so you got 20.

195
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,548
好 你是25個 我是20個
All right, 25 for you, 20 for me.

196
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:37,616
還不錯
Respectable.

197
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,334
你不可能超過我們的
There's no chance you can beat that.

198
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,287
在這等兒著 準備學著點吧
Wait right here, gentlemen. Watch and learn.

199
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,491
你看 那東西長得真無聊
Look at that... How boring that thing looks.

200
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,227
就像新一代的MR2
I mean, it looks like a new-age mr2.

201
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,795
沒錯
That's exactly right.

202
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,564
沒有一個人站在旁邊
Not a single person standing around it.

203
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,616
你去過那邊的陛尚精品店嗎
Have you ever seen Bijan down there?

204
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,801
天吶 那地方太瘋狂了
Oh, my gosh, that place is insane.

205
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:57,252
- 難以置信   - 開始計時吧
Unbelievable. Start the clock.

206
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,904
陛尚裏到處是黃色
A lot of yellow in Bijan.

207
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:00,372
我們在找話題聊天
We're trying to find something to talk about

208
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,541
因為沒人在你的車邊上
because there is nobody around your car.

209
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,109
開什麼玩笑 快看
Are you kidding? Look at that!

210
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,644
沒人
Nobody.

211
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,179
真的沒有一個人在拍照
There's literally not a single person taking a picture.

212
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,247
你們知道為什麼嗎
You know why?

213
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,048
因為它很低調 好嗎
- It's understated. - All right?

214
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,351
人們走過之後
People are gonna walk by and go...

215
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:15,270
第二眼看到它 會說 "哇 我竟然沒看到它
On the second look, they'll go, "wow, I had no idea!

216
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,355
羅森耶"
Rossion!"

217
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:19,057
"哦 一輛MR2"才不會那樣呢
- "Oh, an mr2!" - No, I don't think so.

218
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,460
我覺得他們根本不會那麼說
I don't feel like they're gonna say that at all.

219
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,479
情況不太妙
It wasn't going very well,

220
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,631
於是我決定使用我的斗篷裝置
so I activated my cloaking device.

221
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,417
不好意思
Excuse me.

222
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:31,220
你們知道那邊停著一輛羅森Q1嗎
Did you know there's a Rossion Q1 right up the block?

223
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,721
沒錯 我可以看到你們的表情
Yes! I can see it on your faces.

224
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,757
你們很驚訝 去吧 去看看它
You're amazed. Go ahead. Go take a look at it.

225
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,142
一輛鮮活的羅森Q1
A Rossion Q1 live in the flesh.

226
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,361
開啟了斗篷裝置
With the cloaking device activated,

227
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,846
情況有所好轉
things began to look up.

228
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,148
看看他們 看到沒
Look at them looking. See that?

229
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,617
為什麼這麼多人從陛尚裏過來了
What's this crowd of people coming over from Bijan?

230
00:09:45,702 --> 00:09:47,419
看 他們都過來了
See? Look. They're all coming over.

231
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,755
他們都聚集過來
Look. Look at them gathering around.

232
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,989
奏效了
Word's getting out.

233
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,293
繼續看吧 隨便拍
Go ahead! Enjoy! Take all you want!

234
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,061
這是輛羅森Q1
It's a Rossion! Q1!

235
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:58,497
我已經超過25了 我贏了
I'm over 25. I'm the winner.

236
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,133
我的羅森贏得了挑戰
With my Rossion winning the day,

237
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,235
我們離開比華利山
we left Beverly hills behind

238
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,371
前往莫哈韋沙漠裏的試驗場
and headed to the Mojave desert proving ground.

239
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,371
讓我覺得S7很酷的是...
What makes the S7 so cool to me

240
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,757
它只是史提夫·薩林的一個想法
is that this was just an idea that Steve Saleen had.

241
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,693
他是位成功的肌肉賽車手
He'd been successful racing mustangs,

242
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,028
他與福特關係很好
he had a great relationship with Ford,

243
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,931
他決定用美國的方式來詮釋...
and he decided to make an American interpretation

244
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,199
歐洲超跑
of a European supercar.

245
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,869
從圖紙到成品用了18個月
It went from paper to a working car in 18 months.

246
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:40,372
在這三輛車中
And if you look at these three cars,

247
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:44,143
它向超跑的嘗試是最出色的
it's hands down the best attempt at a supercar here.

248
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,947
羅森Q1是由noble M400改的
The Rossion Q1 is based on the noble M400.

249
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,950
當noble公司不打算再製造它時
When noble decided they're not making anymore of them,

250
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,154
羅森買下了知識產權 製造Q1
Rossion bought the intellectual property and built the Q1.

251
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:58,307
他們想製造一輛你可以天天使用的超跑
They wanted to make a supercar you could use every day.

252
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,360
所以他們對內飾花了很多心思
So they really paid attention to the interior,

253
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:05,063
加入了更多的高端皮革、電動車窗
adding more leather and Alcantara®, power windows,

254
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,966
以及奢侈至極的...手套盒
and the ultimate in luxury... a glove box.

255
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:11,203
從駕駛體驗上看 他們在賽道與日常使用間...
As far as the ride, they seem to have struck a good balance

256
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:13,672
達到了很好的平衡
between track performance and daily driver.

257
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,541
懸掛不是很硬
The suspension is not spine-crushing.

258
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:16,942
甚至有點舒服
It's kind of comfortable.

259
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,812
我保證我現在坐得比坦納舒服
And I guarantee I'm having a better ride than Tanner is.

260
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,214
看看他
Look at him back there.

261
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,683
他就像個卡通人物
He looks like a cartoon character.

262
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,936
你在後面曬得怎麼樣啊
Are you just baking in the sun back there?

263
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,254
你還好嗎
Are you okay, man?

264
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,989
你說什麼
What did you say?

265
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:36,662
這灰塵真煩人
The freakin' dirt is insane.

266
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:39,915
試驗場很酷的一點就是...
The cool thing about a proving ground is that it's a place

267
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,533
你要去那兒證明一些東西
where you go to prove stuff,

268
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,702
你要把車子推到極限
where you get to push things to the limit.

269
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,671
最終我們要讓它覺醒
Finally, we get to open this baby up.

270
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,974
我知道它馬力很強 我知道它輕如鴻毛
I know it's got a ton of power. I know it weighs nothing.

271
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,375
有點蠕動的感覺
It feels a little squirmy,

272
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,244
但我等不及帶它到賽道上嘗試
but I can't wait to get it on a road course and find out.

273
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,416
我們來到了老舊的本田試驗場
We arrived at the old Honda proving grounds.

274
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,720
建於1990年 佔地四千英畝
Built in 1990, the facility stretches over 4,000 acres,

275
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,756
它有一條五英里長的直道
and it has a 5-mile road course, straightaways,

276
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,959
7.5英里的環形道
and a 7-1/2 mile oval.

277
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,994
這地方真酷
How cool is this place?

278
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,596
我很多年前就想來這兒了
I've wanted to come here for years.

279
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:13,031
你可不會在這裏挖出...
It's not like there's old Honda engines buried in the dirt

280
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,033
老的本田引擎什麼的
or something that you're gonna find, you know.

281
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,169
別告訴他啊 你讓他的夢想破滅了
Don't tell him that. You're ruining the magic for him.

282
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,287
看看這兒 我們可以完全釋放它們
Look at this. We can open these things up.

283
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:19,488
沒錯
Hell yes.

284
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,340
我們要幹什麼
What are we gonna do with them?

285
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,243
一台好的超跑要有迅雷不及掩耳的加速
A good supercar promises lightning-quick acceleration,

286
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,312
為了看看哪輛美國車是最快的
so, to see which one of our American cars was the quickest,

287
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,681
我們要來一場百公里加速賽
we're going to have a race... Zero to 60.

288
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,783
- 百公里加速   - 三車並行
- Zero to 60? - Three wide.

289
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:32,784
沒錯
Hell yeah.

290
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,553
沒問題
Not a problem at all.

291
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,663
真是個白癡
What an absolute dork.

292
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,331
天啊
Oh, gosh.

293
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,403
開始吧
Let's go for it.

294
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:56,041
先生們
Gentlemen...

295
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,443
三
In 3...

296
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,846
二
2...

297
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,648
一
1...

298
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:03,949
走
Go!

299
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,319
稍後
Coming up,

300
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,721
我們和歐洲對手正面對決
we go head-to-head with the Europeans...

301
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,456
快 亞當
Come on, Adam!

302
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,824
我們中的一個
...And one of us gets to put

303
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,395
有機會測試30萬美金的肌肉車
a $300,000 muscle car to the test.

304
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:19,937
我們在莫哈維沙漠
We were in the Mojave desert

305
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:22,774
比賽看看誰有最好的美國超跑
competing to see who had the best American supercar.

306
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:26,177
我的Rossion贏得了拍照比賽
My Rossion won the photo challenge,

307
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:29,781
現在是0到60加速比賽
and now it was a zero-to-60 race.

308
00:13:29,882 --> 00:13:31,449
倒數 三
In 3...

309
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,751
二
2...

310
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:35,553
一
1...

311
00:13:35,654 --> 00:13:36,821
出發
Go!

312
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,624
哦 我的輪胎打滑了
Oh, my tires are spinning.

313
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:43,895
60 到了 60
60! There it is. 60.

314
00:13:51,403 --> 00:13:53,638
我一騎絕塵
I smoked them the whole way.

315
00:13:55,908 --> 00:13:58,409
太輕鬆了 小夥伴們
Well, that was easy. Yeah, buddy.

316
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,111
我輪胎打滑了 我起步沒起好
I was spinning the tires. I didn't get a good launch.

317
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:01,179
怎麼了 拉特
What happened, Rut?

318
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,548
馬力太大了
There's so much power, it just...

319
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:05,750
一直在打滑
It spun the tires all the way.

320
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:07,785
你到60的時候剎車了嗎 是的
- Did you stop when you hit 60? - Yeah.

321
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:09,720
這東西一檔就能到65邁
This thing goes 65 in first gear.

322
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:11,222
我根本不用換擋
I didn't have to shift at all.

323
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:13,224
我就一直加到轉速限制 然後踩的剎車
I just went right up to the rev limit and then hit the brakes.

324
00:14:13,325 --> 00:14:15,626
我是說這就意味著Lucrs
I mean, this basically means that the Lucra

325
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:17,662
有擊敗歐洲對手的潛質
could potentially take on the Europeans,

326
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:19,030
但是你們那些我就不確定了
but those guys I don't know.

327
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:19,997
我聽不見
I can't hear.

328
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:20,998
我是說
Basically, it means...

329
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,233
我聽不見你
I can't hear ya!

330
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:23,901
Lucra可以擊敗歐洲對手
That the Lucra could take on the Europeans.

331
00:14:24,002 --> 00:14:26,637
不論他們能不能聽見我
Whether or not they could hear me,

332
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:28,406
我輕鬆地贏得了比賽
I easily won the challenge.

333
00:14:28,507 --> 00:14:31,041
現在我和亞當各勝一場
So with one victory each for Adam and I,

334
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:34,345
我們前往測試場的另一側
we drove off to the other side of the proving grounds

335
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:35,947
去接受下一個挑戰
for our next challenge.

336
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:41,219
先生們 我們下方是本田試驗場裏...
Gentlemen, we are standing above the longest straightaway

337
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,887
最長的直道
here at the Honda proving ground.

338
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:45,123
是的 大概有1.2英里長的直道
Yeah, I think it's 1.2 miles from turn to turn.

339
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:46,724
好的 我們要做什麼
Okay. What are we doing here?

340
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:47,725
很高興你問了
I'm glad you asked.

341
00:14:47,826 --> 00:14:49,260
哦 好的
Oh, yeah.

342
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:51,813
現代歐洲超跑引以為豪的
"Contemporary European supercars pride themselves

343
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,114
是他們的做工質量
"on their build quality

344
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:56,033
並且可以安全地到達極速
"and ability to safely reach their claimed top speeds.

345
00:14:56,118 --> 00:14:58,169
為了測試你們的車能否做到同樣水準
"To see if your cars can do the same,

346
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,320
你們要在一英里內
"you will each have a mile

347
00:14:59,437 --> 00:15:01,105
加速到你們車子自稱的最高時速
"to hit your vehicles' claimed top speeds.

348
00:15:01,206 --> 00:15:02,807
最接近的人獲勝
Closest to the top speed wins."

349
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:04,909
好的
Okay.

350
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,178
我的是200英里每小時
I mean, mine goes 200 miles an hour.

351
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,179
我的也是
So does mine.

352
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,981
就那個 沒有風擋
In that? No windshield.

353
00:15:10,082 --> 00:15:11,349
你會帶頭盔嗎
Are you gonna wear a helmet?

354
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:12,967
是的 我要帶
Yeah. I'm gonna wear a helmet.

355
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:14,852
好 主要是為了防蟲子
- Good. - Just for the bugs, mainly.

356
00:15:14,937 --> 00:15:17,338
好的 你的極速是200英里
Okay, so your top speed is 200 even?

357
00:15:17,456 --> 00:15:18,322
是的 他們是這麼說的
Yeah, that's what they say.

358
00:15:18,423 --> 00:15:19,457
你的呢
What's your top speed?

359
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,658
187 先生們
187, gentlemen.

360
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:22,410
我覺得我有優勢
I think I have an advantage for this one.

361
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:24,195
因為你要達到
'Cause you have to get...

362
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:25,496
187英里
To 187 in a mile.

363
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,248
13英里 看 我自己算出來的
- 13. - See that? - By myself.

364
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:29,000
你做了數學 是的
- You did the math? - Yeah.

365
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:30,268
慢13英里每小時
13 miles an hour slower.

366
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:31,485
因為這有整一英里
Since it's a standing mile,

367
00:15:31,603 --> 00:15:33,671
這就離終點有2/10的距離
and this is about two tenths away from the end,

368
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:36,207
我想我們應該在這待著 你去弄個頭盔
I think we should stay here and you should get a helmet.

369
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:39,277
我同意
I think you're right.

370
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:45,016
毫無疑問 這回很嚇人
This, have no doubt, is going to be very scary.

371
00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:48,052
100英里的時速 沒有風擋
No windshield at 100 miles an hour.

372
00:15:48,153 --> 00:15:52,089
如果你騎過摩托車 非常誇張
If you've ever ridden a motorcycle, it is extreme.

373
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:54,091
但是摩托車上你有頭盔
But with a motorcycle, you have a helmet,

374
00:15:54,193 --> 00:15:56,594
幸運的是 我確實有一個
and, luckily, I do have one of those.

375
00:15:56,695 --> 00:15:59,030
我的意思是 這不僅僅是為了...
I mean, this isn't just about, you know,

376
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,631
你能把右邊的那個踏板踩的多狠
how hard you can press the right pedal,

377
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:02,817
而是你要去踩右邊的那個踏板
it's about the thing that makes you press the right pedal.

378
00:16:02,935 --> 00:16:03,968
膽子
His balls.

379
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:05,670
不 他的腦子 我是要說他的腦子
No, his brain. I was gonna say his brain.

380
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:07,972
好的 讓我點火 她啟動了
All right, let me fire it up. She's running.

381
00:16:21,353 --> 00:16:23,020
100了
That's 100!

382
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,424
他來了
Here he comes.

383
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:31,696
130!
130!

384
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:38,169
已經三檔了 三檔
Third gear already. Third gear.

385
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:40,705
140
140!

386
00:16:40,806 --> 00:16:42,206
150!
150!

387
00:16:42,307 --> 00:16:43,841
160!
160!

388
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:48,112
真快
That's quick.

389
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:51,015
162英里每小時
162 miles an hour.

390
00:17:01,793 --> 00:17:05,096
太瘋狂了
That was insanity!

391
00:17:05,197 --> 00:17:07,064
哦 我的天
Oh, my gosh!

392
00:17:07,165 --> 00:17:09,834
真是太快了
- That was fast. - That was fast.

393
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:14,238
親媽呀 真是太吵了
Holy crimine. That was loud.

394
00:17:18,143 --> 00:17:20,378
頭保住了
Still has a head.

395
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:22,546
讓我從這東西裏出去
Get me out of this thing.

396
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:26,884
看到有多瘋狂了吧
How freaking crazy was that?

397
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,136
你還好?
You okay?

398
00:17:29,254 --> 00:17:30,388
你沒事吧
You all right?

399
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:32,590
我感覺自己剛去了崔健的演唱會
I feel like I just went to a Motley Crue concert.

400
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:34,275
耳朵已經聾了
That was deafening.

401
00:17:34,392 --> 00:17:37,295
我85邁的時候就失去聽力了
I think I lost hearing at about 85.

402
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:39,330
你過去的時候像個晃頭小人
You went by like a bobble head was driving it.

403
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,084
你開了多快
So, how fast did you go?

404
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:44,201
162
162.

405
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:45,303
哇哦 什麼
- Wow. - What?

406
00:17:45,387 --> 00:17:46,837
是的 真是快
Yeah. That's fast.

407
00:17:46,938 --> 00:17:49,406
這就意味著我要超過162
Well, this means I've got to beat 162

408
00:17:49,508 --> 00:17:52,710
因為我的車據說也能跑200英里每小時
since my car also says it'll do 200 miles an hour.

409
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:54,178
咻 去吧
Whew. Go get 'em.

410
00:17:54,262 --> 00:17:55,579
讓我們出發
Let's do it.

411
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:56,647
真是危險
That was dangerous.

412
00:17:56,748 --> 00:17:58,115
真是即可怕又有趣
That was scary. And fun.

413
00:17:58,216 --> 00:18:00,985
我的Lucra達到了162英里每小時
My Lucra's 162-mile-per-hour run

414
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:03,854
比極速慢了38英里
was 38 short of its claimed top speed,

415
00:18:03,955 --> 00:18:05,956
不過對於1英里來說不算慢
but not bad for just one mile.

416
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:09,293
現在該看拉特如何駕馭超跑了
Now it was time to see how Rut would handle supercar speed.

417
00:18:09,394 --> 00:18:10,594
他肯定會嚇尿的
He's gonna freak out.

418
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:13,247
他肯定會說"我的天" 一定是這樣的
He's gonna go, "oh, my God!" And that's gonna be it.

419
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:16,117
哇哇哇 我有孩子
"W-w-w-whoa! I got kids!"

420
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:18,469
我有孩子 我不能做這個
"I got kids! I can't do..."

421
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,672
我在想我的妻兒
All I'm thinking about is my wife and kids.

422
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:26,143
想我們晚飯能吃些什麼
Maybe what we're gonna have for dinner,

423
00:18:26,244 --> 00:18:29,914
想怎麼為我媳婦慶祝下周的生日
what we're gonna do next week for my wife's birthday.

424
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,650
但是我要先對著那個橋有多快開多快
And I've got to drive as fast as I can towards this bridge.

425
00:18:32,751 --> 00:18:35,019
好的 準備好了嗎 大個
All right, you ready, big fella?

426
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,454
開始吧
Let's do this.

427
00:18:43,562 --> 00:18:44,628
哦好的
Oh, yeah.

428
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:48,766
好的 來吧
All right, bring it, big daddy.

429
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,936
出發 200英里每小時的超跑
Here we go. 200 miles an hour in a supercar.

430
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,508
好的 一檔
All right, there's first gear. Okay.

431
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:01,712
慢慢來
Nice and easy there.

432
00:19:01,813 --> 00:19:03,881
好的
Okay.

433
00:19:03,982 --> 00:19:06,217
開始有些發飄了 100了
Oh, it's starting to float around a little bit. That's 100.

434
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:10,421
他來了 他來了
Here he comes. Here he is.

435
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:12,089
紅色小火箭
Just a little red rocket.

436
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:19,764
120 130
Oh, that's 120, 130.

437
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:23,701
140
140.

438
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:25,553
我去
Holy...

439
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,308
我去
Holy sh...

440
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:35,679
160
160.

441
00:19:39,785 --> 00:19:42,186
減速 夥伴
Slow down there, big guy.

442
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:50,544
尼瑪呀 真叫快
Slap your mama, that is fast.

443
00:19:53,498 --> 00:19:56,467
哇哈 半箱油用掉了
Whoo, I just used a half a tank of gas.

444
00:19:56,568 --> 00:20:01,272
我160邁的比坦納慢了2英里
My speed of 160 was 2 miles per hour slower than Tanner's.

445
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:03,641
因為亞當的極速只有187英里
Since Adam's top speed was only 187,

446
00:20:03,742 --> 00:20:06,844
他只要到148就可以勝利
he'd only have to reach 148 to win.

447
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:10,214
亞當 我們已經完成了任務 該你了
Adam, we've made our peace. Have you?

448
00:20:10,315 --> 00:20:13,984
準備好了
I'm ready.

449
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:16,804
出發 我的天
And go. Good lord.

450
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:18,489
好的 我們走
Okay. Here we go.

451
00:20:23,762 --> 00:20:27,331
稍後 亞當是死是活
Coming up, will Adam live or die?

452
00:20:31,477 --> 00:20:33,277
我們在莫哈維沙漠
We were in the Mojave desert

453
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:35,146
測試三輛美國超跑
testing three American supercars.

454
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,115
亞當和我各自贏得一場比賽
Adam and I had each won a challenge

455
00:20:37,216 --> 00:20:39,717
我們正試圖達到最高速
and we were now trying to reach our cars' top speed.

456
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:44,655
我到了162 哦吼吼
I hit 162... Whoo-hoo-hoo!

457
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:46,924
拉特到了160
...Rut hit 160...

458
00:20:48,594 --> 00:20:51,863
現在該亞當出發了
...And now it was Adam's turn.

459
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:54,682
出發 我的神
And go. Good lord.

460
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,334
好的 我們走
Okay. Here we go.

461
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:02,406
出發
There we go.

462
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:04,041
起步不錯
Good launch.

463
00:21:04,142 --> 00:21:07,078
加油 寶貝
Come on, baby.

464
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,249
薩林是全程都很安靜嗎
Was the Saleen just quiet the whole time

465
00:21:12,351 --> 00:21:14,519
然後開始叫喊
until you just started, "rawr"? Just...

466
00:21:14,603 --> 00:21:16,154
你喊的比薩林響
That's louder than the Saleen.

467
00:21:19,658 --> 00:21:21,025
超過100了
Over 100.

468
00:21:21,126 --> 00:21:23,094
110
110.

469
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:24,862
120
120.

470
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:28,366
他已經開始顛了
He's moving around with it already.

471
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:29,634
他還在加速
He's going for it.

472
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:32,870
五檔了
That's it right there.

473
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:34,539
已經夠快了 亞當
That's fast enough, Adam.

474
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,107
加油 寶貝 加速
Come on, baby. Get up there!

475
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,342
挺住 加油
Grab some of it! Let's go.

476
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,313
130
130.

477
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,716
夠快了
Fast enough.

478
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:48,085
140
140.

479
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:50,054
145 哦!
145. Ohh!

480
00:21:58,263 --> 00:21:59,347
真快呀
That was quick.

481
00:21:59,464 --> 00:22:02,183
是的 我是說 真快
Yeah, that... I mean, that seemed fast.

482
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,301
開薩林的時候我沒在這
I wasn't up here for the Saleen, obviously,

483
00:22:04,403 --> 00:22:05,353
但是他真快
but he was booking it.

484
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,240
薩林更紅一些
The Saleen was More red.

485
00:22:09,324 --> 00:22:10,641
怎麼樣
How was it?

486
00:22:10,742 --> 00:22:12,009
真有意思
It was fun.

487
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,377
是的 多快
Yeah? How fast?

488
00:22:13,478 --> 00:22:15,079
145 哦
145. Oh!

489
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,947
yes 等一下
Yes! Wait.

490
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:19,217
是百分比 你們很接近
It's a percentage. See, you were closer.

491
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:20,284
等等 好的!
Oh, wait. Yes!

492
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:21,786
跳吧 跳吧
Do the dance. Do the dance.

493
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:24,021
不 我不需要
No, I don't need to. I didn't stretch.

494
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:27,091
但我們知道Lucra又贏了
But I think we established that somehow the Lucra, again,

495
00:22:27,192 --> 00:22:29,360
它比那些更加超跑
is more of a supercar than those things.

496
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:31,996
你還知道嗎 除非下雨
You know what? Unless it rains.

497
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:33,931
下一個是什麼 我聽夠了
What's next? I've heard enough.

498
00:22:34,032 --> 00:22:35,166
很不錯 我們走
That's nice. Let's roll.

499
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,617
你覺得可能下雨? 我們在沙漠了
You think it's gonna rain? We're in the desert.

500
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:38,536
好消息是 我出汗了
The nice thing is, I'm so sweaty

501
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:40,738
我一直往座椅下滑
I'm just really sliding in the car now.

502
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:43,341
坦納已經兩勝我的Rossion了
With Tanner leading two wins to my Rossion's one,

503
00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:45,793
所以我就要贏得下一個比賽
it was down to me to win the next challenge

504
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,178
逼平比分
and force a tie-breaker.

505
00:22:47,262 --> 00:22:48,879
最後的比賽就在
That challenge would take place

506
00:22:48,964 --> 00:22:50,932
數英里以外的賽道
on a road course a few miles away,

507
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:52,883
給我們機會表現
which gave us a chance to reflect

508
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:54,735
我們車子的能力
on how our cars were shaping up.

509
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:56,854
也許現在比較難開
It may be hard to drive at times.

510
00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:58,456
也許不是路上最快的車
It may not be the fastest supercar on the road.

511
00:22:58,557 --> 00:22:59,590
但你知道嗎
But you know what?

512
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:02,460
我仍然認為它是輛好車
I still think this is a brilliant car.

513
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:06,681
是公路上的猛獸嗎? 是的
Is it a beast on the road? Yeah, it is.

514
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:08,983
想想看
I mean, think about it.

515
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:11,068
S7R拿下了勒芒
The S7R won le mans.

516
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:14,572
我的基本上就是調低的版本
I'm basically in a tuned-down version of that car.

517
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:17,775
所以前面沒有躍馬標誌
So it doesn't have the little prancing horse on the front.

518
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:20,044
沒有以牛來命名 沒什麼大不了
It wasn't named after a bull. Big deal.

519
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:23,447
不會改變我愛這輛車的事實
It doesn't change the fact that I still love this car.

520
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:26,083
而且如果錢不是問題 我一定來一台
And if money was no object, I'd own one.

521
00:23:26,184 --> 00:23:27,802
即便取得勝利
Despite his victories,

522
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,104
Lucra還是不能說服坦納
Tanner was less convinced by the Lucra.

523
00:23:30,222 --> 00:23:31,355
老實講
I'll be honest.

524
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,226
2000磅505馬力
For being 2,000 pounds and 505 horsepower,

525
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:39,030
這東西的加速確實很好
this thing certainly is good at accelerating.

526
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:43,567
不過只要動動方向盤我就能告訴你
But I can tell just by jerking the wheel back and forth

527
00:23:43,652 --> 00:23:46,454
這東西到了彎道絕對是噩夢
that it is gonna be a nightmare in a corner.

528
00:23:46,571 --> 00:23:49,573
前部實在太活躍了
It's just that the front end moves so willingly.

529
00:23:49,675 --> 00:23:52,209
前懸掛非常的紮實
The front suspension is really good.

530
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:53,361
但是尾部
But the back end

531
00:23:53,478 --> 00:23:55,813
根本不知道在做什麼
doesn't necessarily have a clue what's up.

532
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:56,881
但是
But holy crap...

533
00:23:56,982 --> 00:23:58,482
太尼瑪有趣了
Is it fun.

534
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:02,086
我坦白
I'll be honest.

535
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,873
我對Rossion很失望
I'm getting a little disappointed with the Rossion.

536
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,860
有一種自製改裝車的感覺
We have this kind of homemade-y kind of kit-car-ish,

537
00:24:09,961 --> 00:24:14,231
我在後院做的 改自另一輛車
"I made it in the backyard. It's based on this other car."

538
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,367
這就是拼湊而成的
We're frankensteining stuff together.

539
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:19,603
如果美國人真想
If America was seriously considering

540
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:21,238
進入超跑的遊戲
getting into the supercar game,

541
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,541
為什麼不做一台中置引擎克爾維特
why don't they make a mid-engine corvette?

542
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:26,277
造一台可以與法拉利媲美的野獸
Just build a beast to go up against Ferrari.

543
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:28,913
我們要做得就是致力去做
I think we just got to commit ourselves and do it.

544
00:24:29,014 --> 00:24:34,368
目前為止 我們的美國超跑表現得很好
So far, our American supercars had performed pretty well

545
00:24:34,486 --> 00:24:36,353
令人印象深刻的0-60加速
with impressive zero to 60 times

546
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:38,789
和一英里極速的嘗試
and strong top-speed attempts over a mile,

547
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,092
但是我們都是獨自進行的
but we'd been testing in isolation.

548
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:44,478
現在是真正考驗他們的時刻了
Now it was time to find out how good they really were,

549
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:48,232
這就意味著帶來意大利和德國對手
and that meant bringing on two Italians and a German...

550
00:24:49,368 --> 00:24:52,669
40萬美金V12 艾文塔多
The $400,000 v-12 Aventador,

551
00:24:52,753 --> 00:24:54,905
蘭博基尼有史以來造過最好的一輛
one of the best Lamborghinis ever made;

552
00:24:55,006 --> 00:25:00,511
15萬美金保時捷911 GT3 RS
the $150,000 Porsche 911 GT3 RS,

553
00:25:00,595 --> 00:25:02,913
全世界操控最好的車之一
one of the best-handling sports cars in the world;

554
00:25:03,014 --> 00:25:07,818
和 23萬美金法拉利458 意大利
and the $230,000 Ferrari 458 Italia,

555
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,888
2009年一發售便成為經典
an instant classic when it was launched in 2009.

556
00:25:12,524 --> 00:25:14,625
為了測試我們車的綜合操控
As a test of our cars' overall handling,

557
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:17,361
我們要和它們在一條充斥著各種彎道的...
we'd each race one of them over a 2-mile road course

558
00:25:17,462 --> 00:25:19,397
兩英里的賽道上比賽
packed full of twists and turns.

559
00:25:19,498 --> 00:25:22,767
亞當決定第一個出發
Adam had decided to go first.

560
00:25:22,851 --> 00:25:25,886
所以你要讓rossion對法拉利458
So, you're gonna put the Rossion up against the Ferrari 458,

561
00:25:26,004 --> 00:25:28,773
550匹的終極超跑
a 550-horsepower amazing supercar.

562
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:33,511
也是這一代最好的超跑
Arguably one of the better supercars built in our generation.

563
00:25:33,612 --> 00:25:34,879
非常理解 先生們
Totally understood, gentlemen.

564
00:25:34,963 --> 00:25:37,014
458不僅僅是超跑 是一個成就
The 458's not a supercar. It's an achievement.

565
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:39,182
難道我們束手就擒嗎
What are you gonna do, lay down?

566
00:25:39,283 --> 00:25:40,935
你晚上睡得著嗎
You don't go gentle into that good night.

567
00:25:41,052 --> 00:25:43,888
你要的是憤怒的死亡之夜
You rage against the dying of the light.

568
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:45,889
我去 隨你便
Wow. Whatever.

569
00:25:45,991 --> 00:25:47,158
兩台車 一個人
Two cars, one driver.

570
00:25:47,242 --> 00:25:49,160
不是
No.

571
00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:52,430
兩台車 兩個人
Two cars, two drivers.

572
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,004
這就是 我們的希望
Well, there goes all hope.

573
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:03,874
一定很慘
This is gonna suck.

574
00:26:05,444 --> 00:26:08,245
這邊請 試替哥
Right this way, stig.

575
00:26:08,346 --> 00:26:11,248
隨後亞當有了一個好點子
Then Adam had an unusually bright idea.

576
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:12,883
這不合理
This doesn't make any sense.

577
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:16,670
亞當 有個問題 說
- Uh, Adam, question. - Yeah.

578
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:19,190
為什麼他在rossion裏面
- Why's he in the Rossion? - Look.

579
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,091
這是為美國車而戰 對不
This is a fight about American supercars, right?

580
00:26:21,193 --> 00:26:24,028
這個國家的希望不是我
Well, the best shot the country has ain't me.

581
00:26:24,112 --> 00:26:25,196
而是他
It's him.

582
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:27,014
為了國家的利益犧牲自己
Sacrifice yourself for the good of the nation.

583
00:26:27,131 --> 00:26:28,149
我喜歡
I like it.

584
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:30,184
我不是為了我們 先生們
I'm not doing this for us, gentlemen.

585
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:32,703
我這麼做是為了美利堅合眾國
I'm doing this for the United States of America.

586
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:36,205
法拉利都不會知道是怎麼輸的
Ferrari's never gonna know what hit it.

587
00:26:39,945 --> 00:26:43,047
好的 亞當 萬事俱備 準備好了?
All right. Adam, thumbs up, you ready?

588
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:44,181
試替哥 無所謂了
Stig, whatever.

589
00:26:44,282 --> 00:26:47,284
我們走 倒數 3 2 1
Here we go. In three, two, one.

590
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:49,620
出發
Go!

591
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,560
法拉利出發了 哦 哦
Ferrari gets it off the line! Oh! Oh!

592
00:26:58,296 --> 00:27:01,098
試替哥第一個彎要延遲剎車
The stig's gonna outbrake in the first corner.

593
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:05,903
哦 試替哥真是飛過去的
Wow! The stig just blew right by me.

594
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:07,838
他來了 我輸了
There he goes. I'm losing!

595
00:27:07,939 --> 00:27:12,008
我輸了 但是我贏了 但是我們贏了
I'm losing! But I'm win... But we're winning!

596
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:15,846
這個其實可以說通
This actually makes sense.

597
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:17,982
亞當給了車子勝利的機會
Adam's giving that car a fighting chance

598
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:21,018
因為458在數據上更好 是的
- 'cause the 458's a better car on paper, right? - Uh, yeah.

599
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,521
我希望rossion贏 但是不想看起來很糟糕
I want the Rossion to win, but I don't want to look bad.

600
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:29,059
你覺得會很接近嗎
Do you think it's gonna be close?

601
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,327
呃 不
Well, no. I...

602
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:32,997
我覺得試替哥會秒了他
No, I think that stig's gonna walk him.

603
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:34,131
他可是試替哥
He's the stig.

604
00:27:39,905 --> 00:27:41,238
哦 那走線真乾淨
Oh, this part's tight.

605
00:27:43,308 --> 00:27:45,342
他來了 試替哥 我的天
Here he comes, the stig. Oh, my gosh!

606
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,882
快 亞當 快
Come on, Adam! Come on!

607
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:53,851
快 快 快 快
Go! Go, go, go!

608
00:27:57,305 --> 00:27:59,757
一點也不接近
That wasn't even close at all.

609
00:27:59,841 --> 00:28:01,659
這就意味著rossion很快
That means the Rossion's pretty quick.

610
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,965
哈哈 親們 我輸了我們贏了
Ha ha! Fellas, I lost and we won!

611
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:11,035
我不知道什麼意思 不過我覺得是好事
I don't know what that means, but I think this is all good.

612
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,571
不 你知道嗎 你的主意不錯
No, you know what? You had a good idea.

613
00:28:13,655 --> 00:28:15,806
我也用這招 下一個是我
I'm gonna follow suit. Way to go.

614
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:19,176
美國1 歐洲0
It was America 1, Europe zero.

615
00:28:19,277 --> 00:28:23,063
我要用蘭博基尼打敗試替哥
I'm gonna try to beat the stig in a Lamborghini Aventador

616
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:27,050
700匹的四輪驅動
with 700 all-wheel-drive horsepower.

617
00:28:27,152 --> 00:28:28,586
他在薩林裏
There he is in the Saleen.

618
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:32,373
我是說 我希望車贏 所以這就是我在這個車裏的原因
I mean, I want that car to win, which is why I'm in this one.

619
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,690
但也是因為
But I also did this

620
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:36,693
我非常想開艾文塔多
because I really want to drive an Aventador.

621
00:28:41,032 --> 00:28:42,900
嘿 拉特 裏面感覺怎麼樣
Hey, Rut, how you feeling in there?

622
00:28:44,402 --> 00:28:45,869
唯一能讓沙漠更熱的辦法
The only way to make this desert hotter

623
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:48,772
就是坐在一台黑色的車裏
is to get in a black car.

624
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:50,975
好的 先生 準備好了嗎
Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready?

625
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:53,777
我準備好了
I'm ready.

626
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,413
我們走
Here we go

627
00:28:56,498 --> 00:29:00,351
倒數 3 2 1
in three, two, one, go!

628
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,324
快 拉特
Come on, Rut!

629
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:11,729
哦 我在第一個彎之前還領先
Whoo, I'm holding off the stig in the first turn!

630
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,898
蘭博四驅的馬力讓
The power of the all-wheel-drive in the lambo

631
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,583
試替哥只能在後面
is keeping the stig at bay.

632
00:29:18,637 --> 00:29:21,171
不錯 不錯 非常厲害
All right. All right, that was impressive.

633
00:29:21,272 --> 00:29:22,640
他還是領先
He's still leading.

634
00:29:22,724 --> 00:29:24,174
進入第二個彎還是領先
Still leading going into the second corner.

635
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,577
我在做什麼
What am I doing?

636
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:29,179
我怎麼會跑在試替哥前面 真瘋狂
Why did I pull in front of the stig? That's crazy.

637
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,598
哦 親 哦
Whoa, man! Ohh!

638
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:38,889
好的 這就是了
Oh, right, there I go.

639
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,492
哦 你現在是幾檔 哦 哦 哦
Oh, what gear are you in? Oh, oh, oh!

640
00:29:41,593 --> 00:29:43,794
哦 換擋撥片 我用反了
Oh, the panels shift. I went the wrong way.

641
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,598
哦 我的天
Oh, my gosh!

642
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:50,067
700馬力真是不可思議
700 horsepower in this car is amazing.

643
00:29:51,786 --> 00:29:53,470
薩林已經領先很多了
It's a pretty big lead with the Saleen.

644
00:29:53,571 --> 00:29:55,439
他來了
Here he comes.

645
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,840
薩林贏了
The Saleen's got it!

646
00:29:58,943 --> 00:30:01,445
他們來了 S7領先
Here they come, man. The S7 is in the lead.

647
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,117
艾文塔多過去了
And the Aventador passes through.

648
00:30:07,218 --> 00:30:09,987
看 很完美
See? It's perfect.

649
00:30:10,088 --> 00:30:12,222
拉特輸了 美國贏了
Rut loses, America wins.

650
00:30:15,694 --> 00:30:17,394
所以拉特輸了 耶
- So, Rut loses... - Yeah.

651
00:30:17,495 --> 00:30:18,612
在埃文塔頓
In the Aventador,

652
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,415
因為他比試替哥開的慢
but because he's a slower driver than the stig,

653
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:24,451
S7就先過線了
the S7 happens across the line first.

654
00:30:31,342 --> 00:30:33,811
我想應該豎大拇指 是不錯吧?
I think it's a thumbs up. Is it a thumbs up?

655
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:34,912
好樣的
Great job!

656
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:36,580
輸的好
Good job losing!

657
00:30:37,415 --> 00:30:40,217
稍後 這一場景我已經...
Coming up, it's something I've wanted to see

658
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:43,187
期待很久了 坦納vs試替哥
for a long time... Tanner versus the stig.

659
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:50,690
我們的美國超跑迎來最後的挑戰
It was the final challenge for our American supercars,

660
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:53,293
與歐洲競爭對手正面交鋒
a head-to-head race against their European rivals.

661
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:55,495
為了讓我們的車有更大幾率獲勝
To give our cars the best chance of winning,

662
00:30:55,596 --> 00:30:59,266
亞當和我讓試替哥代駕 結果奏效了
Adam and I had the stig drive, and it worked.

663
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:02,552
現在坦納的Lucra要對陣保時捷
Now Tanner's Lucra was up against the Porsche.

664
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:06,306
公平起見 由試替哥駕駛Lucra
To keep it consistent, the stig would drive the Lucra.

665
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,942
如果坦納想要自己的車獲勝 他就得放棄榮譽
While Tanner wanted his car to win, he had his pride.

666
00:31:11,512 --> 00:31:14,781
這並不意味著我要放水
It's not like me to just not go out and try to win.

667
00:31:14,882 --> 00:31:17,384
在直道上 跟它比會有點吃力
On the straightaways, it's gonna be hard to hang with that thing.

668
00:31:17,485 --> 00:31:19,019
但在彎道和剎車方面
But in the corners and braking,

669
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,121
那可是保時捷的拿手好戲
that's what Porsche is legendary for.

670
00:31:21,222 --> 00:31:23,223
那就是GT3 RS所擅長的
That is what the GT3 RS is all about.

671
00:31:23,324 --> 00:31:27,727
今天 它將成為Lucra的終結者
And today, it could be a Lucra-eating machine.

672
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:30,297
你覺得試替哥真的是達妮卡·帕特裏克？(性感女車手)
You think it's true stig's Danica Patrick?

673
00:31:30,381 --> 00:31:31,364
可能
Could be.

674
00:31:31,465 --> 00:31:33,466
好 坦納 你準備好了嗎
All right, Tanner. You ready?

675
00:31:33,568 --> 00:31:34,901
好了
Ready here.

676
00:31:35,002 --> 00:31:37,487
試替哥 我默認你已經準備好了
Stig, I'm just gonna assume you're ready

677
00:31:37,505 --> 00:31:39,338
你都不鳥我一下
and not acknowledge me at all.

678
00:31:39,423 --> 00:31:41,408
好 準備
- Okay. Here we go. - Here we go.

679
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:47,712
三 二 一 走
In three, two, one, go!

680
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,750
哦 起步差不多
Oh, it's a pretty even start.

681
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:53,553
哦 他超過去了
Oh, he's gone.

682
00:31:53,654 --> 00:31:56,923
那台Lucra可真快
Oh! That Lucra is fast.

683
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,561
我要從外線超越
I'm taking him on the outside!

684
00:32:07,235 --> 00:32:09,736
坦納又領先了
Oh, Tanner's in front again!

685
00:32:09,837 --> 00:32:13,306
他就在後面
Oh, he's right on me!

686
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:14,708
我擋住他了
Oh, now I'm holding him up.

687
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:16,042
這可不好
This is bad.

688
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:23,917
在彎道我可以超過他
In the corners, I can get him.

689
00:32:24,018 --> 00:32:26,786
但每次到直道
But on every single straightaway,

690
00:32:26,887 --> 00:32:28,255
他又追回來了
he just bites back.

691
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:38,632
Lucra 他到處漂
Oh, the Lucra! He's sliding everywhere.

692
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:40,333
試替哥很認真啊
The stig is really working for it.

693
00:32:40,434 --> 00:32:43,803
Lucra的動力爆發了 不好
Oh, the power of the Lucra! Oh, no!

694
00:32:43,904 --> 00:32:45,805
我喜歡它 但我又討厭它
I love it, but I hate it!

695
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:51,111
他來了 他超過我了
There he goes. He squirted in front of me.

696
00:32:51,212 --> 00:32:53,380
試替哥超過他了
Oh, the stig's got him.

697
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:56,683
那麼多的馬力可真快啊
It's so fast with all that horsepower!

698
00:32:56,784 --> 00:32:58,485
難以置信
It's unbelievable!

699
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:05,825
我在彎道可以追上他
I'm gaining on him in the corner.

700
00:33:05,926 --> 00:33:07,861
我可以在最後的彎道前超過他
I can get him before the last turn.

701
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:12,365
這兩個傢伙都不松油門的
This is two dudes that don't lift professionally.

702
00:33:12,466 --> 00:33:14,634
直接衝過彎道
Steer through it.

703
00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:16,836
他們來了 他們來了
Here they come. Here they come.

704
00:33:20,908 --> 00:33:24,077
他在猛打方向盤
Oh, he's really sawing at the wheel.

705
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:31,084
不 Lucra贏了
No! The Lucra takes it!

706
00:33:33,087 --> 00:33:35,021
太帥了
That was awesome!

707
00:33:36,824 --> 00:33:37,991
我們站在這作死啊
Why are we standing here?

708
00:33:38,092 --> 00:33:38,992
不知道
I don't know.

709
00:33:41,462 --> 00:33:42,362
怎麼樣
How was it?

710
00:33:42,446 --> 00:33:44,813
- 感覺很卑鄙   - 為什麼
I feel dirty. Why?

711
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:46,716
因為有點像是我贏了
I mean, I know that it's kind of a win...

712
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:48,551
- 對   - 但是我輸了
Yes. ...But I lost.

713
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:50,286
好消息是
Here's the good news.

714
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,739
你輸了 美國贏了
You lost, America won, gentlemen.

715
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,641
你得承認 這些美國車很酷
You have to admit... these American cars are cool,

716
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:56,109
但它們還有很長的路要走
but they still have a long way to go.

717
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,745
比如 你會選這輛還是Lucra？
For example, would you not still choose this over the Lucra?

718
00:33:58,846 --> 00:34:01,081
其實...如果你想要可靠性的話
Well... well, if you're gonna rely on it

719
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:02,849
日常使用的話 當然...
on a daily basis, of course.

720
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,984
你會選擇458還是羅森
Would you choose the 458 over the Rossion?

721
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:05,985
開一整天都沒事
All day long, baby.

722
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,237
奇怪的是
Now, here's the weird thing.

723
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:09,522
我還是會選擇薩林 而不是Aventador
I'd still choose that Saleen over the Aventador.

724
00:34:10,023 --> 00:34:12,091
我覺得Aventador是輛上等的超跑
I realize that the Aventador's a superior car.

725
00:34:12,192 --> 00:34:13,876
我知道 但我不在乎
I get that, but I don't care.

726
00:34:13,993 --> 00:34:15,361
有時這才是超跑的內涵
Sometimes that's what a supercar's about.

727
00:34:15,446 --> 00:34:17,530
就是說 "你知道嗎 我不在乎"
It's about saying, "you know what? I don't care."

728
00:34:17,614 --> 00:34:19,098
我們學到了什麼
So, what'd we learn here?

729
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,333
我覺得我們學到了...
I think we learned

730
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:22,001
美國超跑所做的嘗試很酷
that the American supercars' attempts are cool.

731
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:23,002
很酷的車子
They're cool cars.

732
00:34:23,086 --> 00:34:24,420
但要想與歐洲超跑競爭...
But they've got a long way to go

733
00:34:24,538 --> 00:34:26,506
他們還有很長的路要走
to try to compete with the European supercar.

734
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:28,892
不 這不是我想到的
No. Not what I was actually getting at.

735
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:31,378
我們學到的是——我贏了
What we learned here is that I won.

736
00:34:33,013 --> 00:34:33,930
我喜歡
Love it.

737
00:34:34,047 --> 00:34:35,098
- 他說的對   - 沒錯
That's true. Yeah.

738
00:34:35,215 --> 00:34:36,933
這可不是我學到的
I mean, that's not what I learned.

739
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,318
我也沒學到
I didn't learn that, either.

740
00:34:38,402 --> 00:34:39,385
我懂
I knew that.

741
00:34:39,487 --> 00:34:40,987
小心 要燒胎了
Yeah. Wait. Here comes the burning.

742
00:34:46,994 --> 00:34:50,196
在證明了我的美國超跑是最好的之後
After proving that my American supercar was best,

743
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,898
我要享受戰利品了
I was off to claim my prize.

744
00:34:51,999 --> 00:34:54,167
這是另一台高性能跑車
It was another high-performance car.

745
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:57,137
相較於超跑 它更有肌肉車的味道
This one was a little more muscle than supercar.

746
00:35:04,078 --> 00:35:05,361
當你聽到"梅賽德斯"
When you think "Mercedes,"

747
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,547
你會想到精緻、
you think of words like refinement...

748
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,416
優雅、
Elegance...

749
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:12,552
保守的中產階級會計
Conservative mid-level accountants.

750
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:17,023
最近 他們肯定遇到了中年危機
But recently, they must have had some sort of midlife crisis,

751
00:35:17,124 --> 00:35:19,692
便用那滑稽的德國小煙斗...
put something in that funny little German pipe

752
00:35:19,777 --> 00:35:20,693
抽起煙來
and smoked it.

753
00:35:20,778 --> 00:35:22,829
不像比爾·克林頓 他們確實吸了(克林頓大麻梗)
But unlike Bill Clinton, they inhaled

754
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,998
因為他們製造了這個
because they've gone and made this.

755
00:35:32,106 --> 00:35:37,477
這是梅賽德斯SLS AMG黑系
This is the Mercedes SLS amg black series.

756
00:35:39,814 --> 00:35:42,482
沒錯 它是亮黃色的
And, yes, it is bright yellow.

757
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:44,050
"黑"是他們給那些...
Black is the name they give

758
00:35:44,151 --> 00:35:46,319
高性能車的特別高性能版本...
to the very special performance versions

759
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,854
所取的名字
of their performance cars.

760
00:35:47,955 --> 00:35:49,823
它也名副其實
And it lives up to its name

761
00:35:49,924 --> 00:35:56,896
這輛三十萬美元的車子壞得讓你愛不釋手
'cause this $300,000 car is very bad in a very good way.

762
00:36:04,905 --> 00:36:06,539
好 我們走
Okay, here we go.

763
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,976
這輛SLS的第一項肌肉測試
The first test of the muscle-car credentials of the SLS

764
00:36:10,077 --> 00:36:12,045
必須是百公里加速了
had to be a zero-to-60 run.

765
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:26,059
百公里加速3.6秒 極速198邁
Zero to 60 in 3.6 seconds, 198 mile-an-hour top speed,

766
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,461
聲浪超乎想像
and the sound is unbelievable!

767
00:36:30,764 --> 00:36:32,298
這是輛梅賽德斯？
This is a Mercedes?

768
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:42,275
推力就像貨運火車一樣 太棒了
It just pulls like a freight train, and it's glorious!

769
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:46,813
德國沒有限速 所以他們能好好享受它了
The Germans have no speed limit so they can enjoy this stuff.

770
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:50,183
老天啊 為什麼我們沒有不限速的高速公路
Good lord, why don't we have autobahns?

771
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,699
稱之為肌肉車有點荒謬
Seems a little ridiculous to call it a muscle car,

772
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,650
但你想想看
but if you think about it,

773
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:12,338
這輛SLS已經有了V-8這個噴火猛獸
the SLS already started out as a v-8 fire-breathing monster.

774
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,474
AMG又把它改裝得到處是碳纖維
Then amg put carbon fiber everywhere,

775
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:17,243
擴大了排氣口 改成鋁質
opened up the exhaust, made it out of titanium,

776
00:37:17,328 --> 00:37:20,547
減輕了150磅 讓它更快
lost 150 pounds on the car... Making it faster.

777
00:37:20,648 --> 00:37:22,081
這是許多工廠所做的事情
It's what a lot of companies do here

778
00:37:22,182 --> 00:37:26,436
比如shelby, Saleen, hennessy 增加馬力 減輕重量
like shelby, Saleen, hennessy... Add power, lose weight.

779
00:37:26,554 --> 00:37:27,520
就是這麼簡單
It's simple, really.

780
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:31,090
所以 SLS在這兒就像在家裏一樣
So, the SLS black will be right at home

781
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:32,325
轉速爆表
revving at a red light

782
00:37:32,426 --> 00:37:34,360
行駛在凌晨兩點的美國街頭
on main street, U.S.A., at 2:00 A.M.

783
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,329
但那也是所有...
But that's where the similarities

784
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,665
美國肌肉車的終點
with the all-American muscle cars end.

785
00:37:43,404 --> 00:37:45,939
梅賽德斯以高科技的創新...
Mercedes prides themselves on high-tech innovation

786
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,740
和高額的研發經費而自豪
and limitless research budgets.

787
00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:50,810
這就意味這輛肌肉車應該可以做...
That means that this muscle car should be able to do

788
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:52,946
其他肌肉車做不到的事情
what other muscle cars can't do...

789
00:37:53,047 --> 00:37:55,131
高速過彎
Corner at high speed.

790
00:38:04,391 --> 00:38:07,860
為了找到答案 我前往高山
So, to find out, I headed for the hills.

791
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,834
這兒 女士們先生們 這才是公路
And this, ladies and gentlemen, this is a proper road.

792
00:38:17,304 --> 00:38:19,505
加州南部的74號高速
Southern California's highway 74,

793
00:38:19,607 --> 00:38:22,108
把普通肌肉車當早餐
which eats ordinary muscle cars for breakfast.

794
00:38:22,209 --> 00:38:25,979
稍後 我將試駕SLS黑系...
Coming up, I put the SLS black series to the test

795
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,480
嘗試在10分鐘內...
when I try to cover 10 miles

796
00:38:27,581 --> 00:38:31,484
通過全美最危險公路之一的10英里路程
of one of America's most dangerous roads in less than 10 minutes.

797
00:38:36,124 --> 00:38:38,125
我們來到加州沙漠
We've been in the California desert

798
00:38:38,227 --> 00:38:40,661
看看誰選的美國超跑最好
competing over which was the best American supercar.

799
00:38:40,746 --> 00:38:43,497
我的Lucra贏了 這意味著...
My Lucra had won, and that meant

800
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,202
我將試駕德國肌肉車——梅賽德斯SLS AMG黑系
I got to drive a German muscle car... Mercedes SLS AMG black.

801
00:38:48,303 --> 00:38:50,938
它在直道上已經證明了自己
It had proven itself in a straight line,

802
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:53,007
現在我要在一段十英里的自殺公路上
but now I was going to test its cornering ability

803
00:38:53,108 --> 00:38:55,376
測試它的彎道性能
in a 10-mile suicide run

804
00:38:55,477 --> 00:38:57,745
遍佈發卡彎和一百英尺的懸崖
with hairpin bends and 100-foot dropoffs.

805
00:38:57,846 --> 00:38:59,513
為了讓挑戰更有趣
And to make it interesting,

806
00:38:59,615 --> 00:39:02,516
我要在十分鐘之內完成
I was gonna try to do it in less than 10 minutes,

807
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:05,636
也就是說平均每分鐘要開一英里
which would mean averaging at least a mile a minute.

808
00:39:05,754 --> 00:39:11,559
好 在我面前 是一段十英里的狹窄崎嶇山路
Okay. Ahead of me, we have 10 miles of twisty, gnarly road.

809
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,029
為了應對 我們有碳陶瓷剎車
But against that, we have carbon ceramic brakes.

810
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,732
我們有622匹馬力
We have 622 horsepower.

811
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:20,468
我們有上千名梅賽德斯和AMG的工程師...
We have thousands of Mercedes and AMG engineers

812
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:22,670
建造的機器 只為了做一件事...
who built a machine to do one thing,

813
00:39:22,754 --> 00:39:26,274
把十英里的山路一口吞下
and that is to devour that 10 miles in one gulp.

814
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:28,476
不要讓我太得意
And stop me if I'm smiling too much.

815
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:29,577
準備
Here we go.

816
00:39:33,315 --> 00:39:34,382
出發了
And we're off!

817
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:44,725
老天啊
Good lord!

818
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:49,764
我在做一件非常危險的事
I'm doing something so dangerous!

819
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:51,198
我喜歡
I love it!

820
00:39:57,372 --> 00:40:00,274
感覺我在駕駛一條黃色巨龍
Feel like I'm riding a giant yellow dragon

821
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:01,909
通過地獄之門
through the gates of hell.

822
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:16,657
三英里過後 我達到了75邁的平均速度
3 miles in and I'd managed to average 75 miles an hour.

823
00:40:16,758 --> 00:40:18,025
我的計劃超前了
I was ahead of schedule.

824
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:19,293
我要趕時間
Now we're getting after it.

825
00:40:26,868 --> 00:40:28,803
牽引力控制系統完全關閉了
Traction control is completely off.

826
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:31,772
只有少數電子元件在工作
Still a few electronics going on with a...

827
00:40:31,873 --> 00:40:35,710
天啊 你好 ABS
Oh, my gosh. Hello, ABS

828
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:37,812
近況如何
How's your day going?

829
00:40:40,415 --> 00:40:43,484
感覺我正在打破物理定律
It felt like I was breaking the laws of physics.

830
00:40:46,521 --> 00:40:47,822
我已經開了六英里了
I was already 6 miles in

831
00:40:47,923 --> 00:40:50,491
時間還剩下四分多鐘
and still had over four minutes on the clock.

832
00:40:55,397 --> 00:40:58,299
但群山沒有放棄
But the mountain wasn't giving up.

833
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,570
它要動真格 它請來了蕭敬騰
It wanted blood, and it called in the rain gods.

834
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:08,209
下雨了 路況不太理想
Now, rainy conditions, of course, are not ideal,

835
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:10,811
特別是用著晴胎
especially when working with dry-weather tires

836
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,247
它必須有足夠的溫度才行
that like to be right up to temperature.

837
00:41:14,282 --> 00:41:15,716
但是潮濕路面...
But the wet is a place

838
00:41:15,817 --> 00:41:18,853
能夠讓你真正地窺探一輛車的裙底
where you really look under the skirt of a car

839
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:22,289
看看裏面究竟有什麼...別想歪了
and really see what it's about... not to be too graphic.

840
00:41:22,391 --> 00:41:25,810
不管是晴是雨 已經沒有退路了
Rain or not, there's no turning back now.

841
00:41:36,405 --> 00:41:40,107
別忘了 黃色代表著危險
Don't forget, yellow is the color for danger.

842
00:41:41,476 --> 00:41:46,614
這顛簸的路面、這淅瀝的小雨 黃色就對了
This bumpy road...And this rain... it's the right color.

843
00:41:51,186 --> 00:41:52,720
老天啊
Good God!

844
00:41:55,924 --> 00:41:59,927
天啊 高速時太難過彎了
Oh, God. It is just the twitchiest thing at speed.

845
00:42:00,028 --> 00:42:02,029
我不確定這是不是...
I'm not sure if it's just a problem

846
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:06,934
輪胎抓地力所造成的問題
coping with the amount of grip that the tires create or what,

847
00:42:07,035 --> 00:42:09,070
但這真尼瑪嚇人
but [Bleep] It's scary.

848
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:12,039
我還有一英里 雨拖慢了我
I had a mile to go, but the rain had slowed things down

849
00:42:12,124 --> 00:42:14,575
我必須在一分鐘內完成
so I had to cover it in less than a minute.

850
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,391
最後的彎道
Here's the last turn.

851
00:42:35,564 --> 00:42:36,831
我成功了
I had done it.

852
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:41,051
不敢相信SLS打敗了時間
Incredibly, the SLS had managed to beat the clock.

853
00:42:41,169 --> 00:42:43,838
在這樣的速度和路況下行駛
Driving at these speeds and these conditions

854
00:42:43,922 --> 00:42:45,339
如果開的是普通的車子
in your average car

855
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,008
這可能是你最後一次開車了
would most likely be your last time behind the wheel.

856
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:51,011
但梅賽德斯讓不可能變成可能
But Mercedes has made it possible.

857
00:42:53,482 --> 00:42:56,317
這不是一輛普通的車
And this is not a simple car.

858
00:42:56,418 --> 00:42:58,853
它原始 它純粹
It's raw. It's pure.

859
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:01,822
但還是由電腦控制著
But it still is electronically controlled.

860
00:43:01,923 --> 00:43:04,525
當你抬起油門時 會有一絲猶豫
There's a little hesitation when you lift off the throttle.

861
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:05,860
這些控制...
There is controls

862
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:08,796
成為駕駛體驗的一部分
that are always a part of your driving experience.

863
00:43:08,897 --> 00:43:12,433
本質上講 梅賽德斯製造了...
So, essentially, what Mercedes has built

864
00:43:12,534 --> 00:43:15,970
地球上最聰明的肌肉車
is about the smartest muscle car on the planet.

865
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:21,175
SLS黑系確實是一項...
The SLS black is, indeed,

866
00:43:21,276 --> 00:43:23,644
卓越而驚人的成就
a stunning and outrageous achievement

867
00:43:23,745 --> 00:43:26,714
不只是因為它那全能的性能表現
not just because of its all-in-one performance package

868
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:30,518
更是因為它代表了大公司...
but more because it represents that big car companies

869
00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:32,686
仍然有著推動汽車產業...
still have the desire in what they can do

870
00:43:32,787 --> 00:43:35,189
技術革新的慾望
when they want to push the automotive envelope.

871
00:43:36,057 --> 00:43:39,293
這讓我又回想到美國的超跑
And that brings me back to the American supercar.

872
00:43:39,394 --> 00:43:41,812
小手工作坊竭盡所能...
Boutique shops are doing their best

873
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:45,666
在世界舞台上競爭 而汽車三巨頭們又在幹嘛呢
to compete on a world scale, but what about the big three?

874
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:48,335
福特GT發佈、成為世界級的超跑
It's been since 2004 when the Ford gt came out

875
00:43:48,436 --> 00:43:51,138
那已經是2004年的事情了
as a world-beating supercar that we've done that.

876
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:54,909
道奇、雪佛蘭、福特 來吧
Dodge, Chevy, Ford, come on.

877
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,377
我們準備好了
We are ready.
