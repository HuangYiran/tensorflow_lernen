00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,010
BATESVILLE, UTAH

3
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,690
Is there a problem?

4
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,410
Jack Benson was a friend of mine.

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,150
- I'm... I'm so sorry. - You were the one in charge, right?

6
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,540
Some kind of manager? Uh, he... he was my friend, too.

7
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,280
Jack's wife said it was your fault. That true?

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,220
You know what? Um, never mind.

9
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,700
I think I'm just gonna go somewhere else.

10
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,090
Hey! I asked you a question. Stay away from me.

11
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,380
<i>Oh, man! What the hell?</i>

12
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,830
- You did that? - No, I... I swear.

13
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,780
Get away from me!

14
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,660

19
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,870
We have a mission.

20
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,060
- Any specifics? - No.

21
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,590
Well, we should follow the same plan as before...

22
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,320
take separate routes back, stagger our timing so no one suspects...

23
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,120
<i>Wait, a telekinetic? I thought they didn't exist.</i>

24
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,080
We never verified one. That's why we're going to Batesville...

25
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,780
to conduct an index asset evaluation and intake.

26
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,480
Does that mean we talk to her and see if she has powers?

27
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,280
- Basically. - Well, that needs a better name...

28
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,950
less I.R.S., more... better.

29
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,010
Something like the welcome wagon.

30
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,310
I want you to pay close attention on this one, Skye.

31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,750
It's an opportunity to learn how to deal with someone with newfound abilities.

32
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,650
It's not like I've never done this before.

33
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,070
- I found Mike Peterson before you did.
- Remember how that went?

34
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,370
This is a chance to see how it's done when it's done right.

35
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,670
How many people like this have you encountered?

36
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,380
A handful. There's not that many people on the index.

37
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,950
They must wig out when they see the S.H.I.E.L.D. trucks roll up.

38
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,280
Each case is different. Some people are in complete denial

39
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,400
<i>that there's anything unusual about them.</i>

40
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,860
<i>It's a delicate process, and from all reports,</i>

41
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,600
this sounds like a particularly sensitive situation.

42
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,870
"Particle accelerator explodes. "

43
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,940
Hannah Hutchins, one of the quality-control engineers.

44
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,490
<i>- Was it her fault? - The town blames her.</i>

45
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,470
Four technicians died in that blast... on her watch.

46
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,770
<i>That's terrible... all those families.</i>
LABORATORY ACCIDENT KILLS 4
The Victims of Laboratory Explosion

47
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,730
Small church community... they're pretty rattled. She must be, too.

48
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,980
Friends, co-workers dead, and on top of all that,

49
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,800
<i>she might have some crazy power she can't understand.</i>

50
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,750
- Or control. - Sir, the department of energy's

51
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,410
<i>declared the particle acceleration lab too dangerous to enter.</i>

52
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,740
<i>But the good news is,</i> we still think we can retrieve the disaster-event data

53
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,860
from the instruments.

54
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,170
We'll determine the cause and see if there's any correlation

55
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,720
between telekinesis spontaneously forming

56
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,580
and a particle accelerator exploding.

57
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:05,040
Well, it does use giant magnets to fire billions of subatomic particles

58
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,240
into their anti-particles at the speed of light

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,140
to create miniature big bangs, so... seems like a good place to start.

60
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,950
- I read. - I'll try not to mention big bangs when we talk to Hutchins about the explosion.

61
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,860
You'll stay in the car. This is a delicate situation.

62
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,060
We don't know what kind of danger this woman poses,

63
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,280
so I'll make initial contact with Agents Ward and May.

64
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,600
<i>Wheels up in five. Better strap in.</i>

65
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,780
It's a delicate situation, so you're bringing along warm and fuzzy?

66
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,480
- Hey, guys. - You're late.

67
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,570
<i>We know what you did.</i>

68
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,510
<i>She blew up that gas station. Why aren't you arresting her?</i>

69
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,590
Officer, is there anything you can do to get these people to disperse?

70
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,540
Been trying, but it's a free country.

71
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,540
Miss Hutchins, I'm Agent Coulson.

72
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,710
We specialize in strange occurrences like the ones you've encountered.

73
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,130
- You've come to lock me up? - To talk.

74
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,510
Well, what good will that do?

75
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,330
<i>Get out of here!</i> We don't want you here anymore.

76
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,570
Officers, get those people back.

77
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,510
<i>Move it! Move it!</i>

78
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,420
<i>It's her! That freak just tried to kill us!</i>

79
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,440
Calm down.

80
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,730
Easy, officer. Put the gun down.

81
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,830
Leave me alone. Miss Hutchins, please calm down.

82
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,730
- It wasn't me. - Please calm down.

83
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,460
We're not gonna let anyone hurt you.

84
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,320
- Time to go. - So much for the welcome wagon.

85
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,790
Particle Accelerator Complex
Authorized Personnel Only

86
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,870
<i>We don't believe that people have telekinetic powers, do we?</i>

87
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,230
Well. May was forced to sedate her.

88
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,310
The woman made a police car move... with her mind.

89
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,550
<i>There's no principal that would support...</i>

90
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,430
Telekinesis. Not yet.

91
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,210
We did believe for a bit, though, remember? Freshman year?

92
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,690
When Sally Webber made the books fall off the table in neurobiology?

93
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,560
Oh, well, that was a particularly cruel prank.

94
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,030
- You screamed like a girl. - I am a girl.

95
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,580
You know, that's the one drawback of graduating three years early...

96
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,060
we never to pull any freshman pranks on anyone else.

97
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,740
Fitz... Skye never went to the academy.

98
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,430
- She's a freshman. - A wide-eyed little freshman.

99
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,530
And being pranked is an integral part of becoming a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

100
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,910
Well, mandatory, really.

101
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,960
<i>Why not give her the full S.H.I.E.L.D. academy experience?</i>

102
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,240
It would be unjust to deny her such a thing.

103
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,360
Information data uploaded. Let's get going.

104
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,270
Yes, sir.

105
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,370
Just a mattress, sir? It's a six-hour-long ride to the fridge.

106
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,530
Fitz added magnetic shielding to the cage after Simmons had her scare.

107
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,570
If miss Hutchins has this power,

108
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,770
then that room should keep it from getting out,

109
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,940
but in there, she'll be just as dangerous.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,350
- How is she? - The dendrotoxin's wearing off.

111
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,570
She'll be awake soon, scared, in a strange room.

112
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,750
<i>Our next interaction with her is crucial to gaining her trust,</i> which is why I want you there.
(Capture:ON)

113
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,860
Are you sure that's a good idea?

114
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,700
If miss Hutchins is gonna believe anything we say,

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,090
she needs to know we're not hiding things from her,

116
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,890
which means you explaining the situation.

117
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,220
What if that doesn't calm her down? What if that makes her more agitated?

118
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,550
- Then he definitely wants me in there. - Pretty much.

119
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,440
- I'll observe from out here. - And I'll lose the tie.

120
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,870
If she is telekinetic, I don't want to have a noose around my neck.

121
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,470
Brought you some water.

122
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,590
<i>It's okay. I'm Phil. This is Melinda May.</i>

123
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,830
- How did I get here? - I sedated you.

124
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,950
I apologize for bringing you in that way.

125
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,030
<i>Things were escalating. It was for everyone's safety.</i>

126
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,200
Everyone's safety. Good. Okay.

127
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,890
Oh, lord, what have I done? I promise you, miss Hutchins...

128
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,330
nobody was hurt back there.

129
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,970
Wherever I go, things turn bad.

130
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,140
Were you angry at those people, back at the house?

131
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,130
Um, angry? No. I know most of them.

132
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,440
They were angry. I understand.

133
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:30,080
Oh, god. Frank's wife... the way she was looking at me.

134
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,300
Frank Delacort. He died in the accident.

135
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,880
Because of me, they're gone. I killed them.

136
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,830
- So sad. - And normal.

137
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,440
<i>These readings are entirely within average ranges.</i>

138
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,490
<i>Of course, it's hard to find something</i>

139
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,120
<i>when you don't know what you're looking for.</i>

140
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,800
All I can tell from these brain waves is she's upset.

141
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,450
You need a computer for that?

142
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,870
May's in there... the woman who shot her.

143
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,400
<i>Sedated her.</i>

144
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,360
Things got out of hand. May sorted it out.

145
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,030
- She's the Cavalry. - Mm.

146
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,520
Where does that name come from, anyway?

147
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,700
- Didn't Ward tell you? - You don't know?

148
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,410
Of course not. You spent no time at the academy.

149
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,240
<i>It's quite a story.</i>

150
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,140
Yeah, well, Ward isn't exactly a chatty S.O.

151
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,320
Well, imagine if you will...

152
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,370
...a heavily secured compound. Manama, Bahrain.

153
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,770
Multiple S.H.I.E.L.D. agents are taken hostage, tortured for information.

154
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,840
May's mission... eliminate the threat.

155
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,610
You mean kill people.

156
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,170
Not people... entire squads of mercenaries,

157
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,520
- almost 100. - More than 100.

158
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,310
More than 100 men, heavily armed.

159
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,740
Her vehicle got totaled, so she rode in.

160
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,960
And, um, she had a M249 in each hand.

161
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,130
Right... in each hand. And she rode in on a horse.

162
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,170
- Hence the name... the Cavalry. - Is this real?

163
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,830
She eliminated the enemy threat single-handedly.

164
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,550
She saw a lot of hurt that day.

165
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,270
- Is that why she's so... - Happy?

166
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,880
Particle accelerator data loading.

167
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,900
No! You do not touch that!

168
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,550
Two semesters minimum of holographic engineering

169
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,440
- before you get to touch this! - All right, all right.

170
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,990
I get it. I didn't go to your stupid

171
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,690
S.H.I.E.L.D. hogwarts or whatever. I'm gonna go upstairs.

172
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,690
And I'm gonna do my own research on my computer...

173
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,500
my boring, old, flat computer.

174
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,220
- Can you believe she bought that? - A horse... brilliant.

175
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,040
<i>You think you have the next prank?</i>

176
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,290
- We must carry on the tradition. - Yeah.

177
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,130
For weeks, I was getting reports from section two

178
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,590
complaining that the coupling assembly was coming loose at the bolts.

179
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,410
Tobias is the...

180
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,940
He was the technician down there.

181
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,650
We replaced the part, and we triple-checked it for damage.

182
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,590
Seems like I went down there every few days.

183
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,870
Did you find a problem?

184
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,060
No. But clearly, I missed something.

185
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,730
My team is working to determine what really did happen and what might have happen to you.

186
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,350
To me? What do you mean?

187
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,300
We believe that somehow, as a result of the accident,

188
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,310
you acquired some form of telekinetic ability.

189
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,920
You think it's me?

190
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:12,230
The police car, the gas sta... you think I did that?

191
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,810
<i>We're not sure, and this can be a hard thing to hear,</i>

192
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,340
but all these events have one thing in common.

193
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:25,260
Me, but I'm not causing it. It's not me.

194
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,600
I wish it were because then maybe I could make it stop.

195
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,960
But if it's not you, then what is it?

196
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,450
You people won't believe me.

197
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,300
Try me.

198
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,610
God's punishing me.

199
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,360
He abandoned me. He doesn't protect me anymore.

200
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,000
That's why this is happening.

201
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,840
- Protect you from what? - Demons, sir.

202
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,690
I'm being haunted by demons.

203
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,220
Delusions of being persecuted aren't uncommon after trauma.

204
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,300
She's certainly been through her fair share.

205
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,800
She's blaming herself. It's guilt.

206
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,950
It's all of it. She's broken. Pore over the accident site.

207
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,350
If that tragedy gave her powers, we need to shut them down.

208
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:35,940
<i>If it wasn't her fault, even better,</i> but until then, she's a danger to all of us.

209
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,310
Just let me go in and talk to her, sir, as a friend.

210
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,350
I can't let you do that. It's too dangerous.

211
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,020
She's not dangerous. She's nice... like, overly nice.

212
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,700
She never misses a birthday post to her friends,

213
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,480
runs the youth program at her church, rescues dogs.

214
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,110
Hannah's a safety inspector not just because she's detail-oriented

215
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,810
- but because she... - She genuinely cares.

216
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,140
Right. And someone with that much empathy

217
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,030
being responsible for that much loss of life, she's devastated,

218
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,950
spouting nonsense about god punishing her for...

219
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,830
People believe what they need to believe to justify their actions.

220
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,510
Is that how you justify your shoot-first policy?

221
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,660
At least let me try to repair that damage.

222
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,980
Until we figure out what's going on with her,

223
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,360
she stays locked up and you stay away.

224
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,290
Thought that was glued down.

225
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,380
You're asking the right questions, Skye,

226
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,130
but for now, that's all you get to do. I'm sorry.

227
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,390
I just don't understand her at all.

228
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,260
Everything to her is just...

229
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,750
"Target acquired. Threat eliminated. "

230
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,030
- Well, she's a specialist. - In one thing.

231
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,000
You can catch a lot more flies with honey

232
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,330
- than with napalm... just saying. - Hand me the lettuce.

233
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,480
And she says I need to stay away, but you know what I think?

234
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,600
I think she needs to get laid.

235
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,670
Might want to be less confrontational with Agent May.

236
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,480
I'm not scared of her. Well, I am,

237
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,570
but just because the Cavalry shot 100 guys on horseback

238
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,010
doesn't mean she knows how people work.

239
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,980
Wait, horseback? Where'd you hear that?

240
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,640
- Fitz-Simmons. - Were they messing with you?

241
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,760
Story gets bigger every year.

242
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,230
It wasn't 100 guys... it was 20. Trained assassins.

243
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,690
May crossed them off with one pistol, no support.

244
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,130
- She rescued a bunch of agents? - Mm-hmm.

245
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,480
There definitely wasn't a horse.

246
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,480
Well, if it went so well, why's she so squirrelly about the name?

247
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,010
I don't know, May's not in it for the glory.

248
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,880
She got the job done. End of story.

249
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,380
Where'd I put that knife?

250
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,700
Leave me alone!

251
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,040
Oh, god, please forgive me!

252
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,800
Oh. This must be the coupling from the reports.

253
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,940
Oh, dear. The technicians were right.

254
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,450
Were you even listening?

255
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,030
<i>You weren't even a wee bit scared?</i>

256
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,530
More disappointed, really.

257
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
It's fine. It's fine.

258
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,510
I'm just workshopping here, and, yes, I was listening.

259
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,270
I was about to go fetch our own magnetic couplings

260
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,550
to run simulations.

261
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,300
Oh, well, while you're in there, grab some more diazepam for Hannah.

262
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,140
She may need to be more heavily sedated.

263
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,090
And the prank needs more work, as well.

264
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,580
I know. I'm trying different things.

265
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,120
It's the timing that matters, Simmons.

266
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,260
<i>Skye can't suspect a thing.</i>

267
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,170
Laboratory Accident Kills Four, Lone Survivor Questioned

268
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,850
TOBIAS FORD

269
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,390
Ward, come look at this.

270
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,960
Tobias Ford.

271
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,440
Oh, isn't he one of the technicians who died at the plant?

272
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,170
Yeah, and he filed three safety complaints

273
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,750
in the past month, each one in Hannah's department.

274
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,890
She thought he was a friend. But he had it out for her.

275
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,300
Sad part is... he was right.

276
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,280
Oh. Couplings.

277
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,310
<i>Couplings, couplings. Yes.</i>

278
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,590
Actually... Oh.

279
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,580
<i>Now, this I could use.</i>

280
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,610
All I need now is a little bit of twine

281
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,140
and an unsuspecting victim.

282
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,180
<i>Oh, that's fantastic, that is.</i>

283
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,690
<i>Well, that's odd.</i>

284
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,990
My god. Fitz, look at this.

285
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,460
What are we seeing here?

286
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,860
It's as if the explosion tore open some sort of window to...

287
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,990
To hell.

288
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,800
Simmons! Are you okay?

289
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,280
Sir, Hannah's telling the truth. She's not telekinetic.

290
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,960
There's someone else on this plane.

291
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,720
- What was that? - Plane's lost power.

292
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,960
We're going down.

293
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,400
- Ward, you certified? - What about engine-driven generators?

294
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,970
Those are dead, too.

295
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,440
Switch batteries to maintain flight controls.

296
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,680
The rest will be needed to keep the cage shielded.

297
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,650
Flaps... 10.

298
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,470
- Lower landing gear. - What can I do?

299
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,470
Buckle up.

300
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,030
There's a decent-sized field up ahead, but it's gonna be rough.

301
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,820
Vertical landing's out.

302
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,430
- Coming in a little hot. - I got it.

303
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,780
Our ear comms are usually relayed through the plane, so here's some hardware.

304
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,230
<i>Did the girl do this to us, sir?</i>

305
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,640
We believe miss Hutchins is the victim here.

306
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,530
Our theories about her powers have been disproved.

307
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,380
- By who? - I saw a ghost.

308
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,450
I... I know how it sounds,

309
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,510
but a man attacked me, and then he disappeared.

310
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,830
- Did you get a good look at him? - He dematerialized!

311
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,450
May, run your systems checks. Is the cage still shielded?

312
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,230
Most of the power dedicated to it.

313
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,670
This man or whatever he is has been tormenting miss Hutchins.

314
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,840
The cage might be the one thing protecting her now.

315
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,010
- We'll inform her. - Sir, can it be me to talk to Hannah?

316
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,340
Her life has been turned upside down, and we stuck her in a nightmare box.

317
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,940
She thinks she's being punished.

318
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,200
Can I please be the one to deliver the good news?

319
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,290
That a non-corporeal madman is hunting her?

320
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,440
Again, I think it'd be better coming from anyone else, really.

321
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,690
All right. I'll head upstairs,

322
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,210
activate the emergency transceiver, and radio HQ.

323
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,930
Ward, take a firearm. Escort Fitz-Simmons downstairs,

324
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,520
<i>assess the damage, get us up and running.</i>

325
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,520
Wait. Guys, um... where's Fitz?

326
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,210
<i>Hello? Can anybody hear me?</i>

327
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,530
What the hell's happening?

328
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:45,470
Did we crash? Who was screaming?

329
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,420
<i>This is not funny, Jemma, if this is a prank.</i>

330
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,850
This is a prank.

331
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,340
Clever.

332
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,530
Simmons?

333
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,660
Come on. Turn on the lights.

334
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,230
Thank god. Where have you been?!

335
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,970
<i>I have been locked in a closet freaking out,</i>

336
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,720
- thanks to you two geniuses. - That wasn't us.

337
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,890
- Well, then, who was it? - We found Fitz.

338
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,100
<i>Good, we'll need him.</i>

339
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,600
Looks like the main problem is in avionics bay two.

340
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,500
<i>But he took out all our systems.</i>

341
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,630
- Who's she talking about? - Grab your equipment and get in there.

342
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,270
I'm going to power down flight controls to conserve energy

343
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:05,310
and then go defend the cage door in case this ghost comes knocking.

344
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,630
Did she just say "ghost"?

345
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,780
<i>Mayday, mayday, mayday.</i>

346
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,290
Region North, this is S.H.I.E.L.D. 616.

347
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,270
We've lost electrical and are grounded.

348
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,130
Calculating coordinates, requesting supp...

349
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,140
ERROR

350
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,070
1990s technology at its best.

351
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,210
- Hannah? - Who's there?

352
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,030
My name is Skye. We haven't met yet.

353
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:50,090
We crashed, didn't we? Are you all hurt?

354
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,670
- I'm so sorry. - No. No, no, no. We're okay.

355
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,760
<i>Whatever's happening, it's not your fault.</i>

356
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,310
<i>We were wrong.</i>

357
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,040
But you need to stay in that room so that you're safe.

358
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:07,060
Something... bad is out here.

359
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,430
Demons.

360
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,250
I don't know what it is.

361
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,980
Do you believe in god?

362
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,130
Honestly?

363
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,180
- Not really. - Well, I do.

364
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,460
And I know that he's punishing me, and I deserve it.

365
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,570
No. No, you don't. No one does.

366
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,960
I had a few nuns around me growing up, and they would talk like that,

367
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,110
scaring kids with stories of god's wrath.

368
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,850
It made me not want to believe.

369
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,970
The only words that stuck with me

370
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:09,120
<i>were something that sister McKenna said from the Bible, I think.</i>

371
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,410
<i>She said, "god is love. "</i>

372
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,450
<i>It's simple and it's a little sappy,</i>

373
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:20,530
but that's the version I like. God is love...

374
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,990
the thing that holds us together.

375
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,520
And if that's true,

376
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,860
<i>I don't think he would punish you for making a mistake.</i>

377
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,460
<i>I think he'd forgive a mistake.</i>

378
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:39,450
- I want to believe that. I do. - I'll stand guard now.

379
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,340
Coulson needs help with the emergency transceiver.

380
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,130
I would rather stay here for a while...

381
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,050
It needs to get done, not discussed. That's an order.

382
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,690
I'll nearby if you need me, okay?

383
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,950
Try not to hurt her any more than you already have, Agent May.

384
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,170
<i>He thinks it's hell, but I think it's an alien world.</i>

385
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,810
<i>- Fitz, it was stunning. - Well, there were reports in London</i>

386
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,900
<i>after the spaceship landed of multiple portals opening,</i>

387
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,670
<i>Thor passing between worlds.</i>

388
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,110
You think that's what they were researching at that lab?

389
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,310
Trying to create another portal, yes.

390
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,620
Failing until a malfunction produced a burst of energy.

391
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:30,430
This "ghost" is a man trapped between our universe and another.

392
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,540
Perhaps that's how all ghosts are. It's a simple explanation, really.

393
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,540
Simple would be a relative term in this case.

394
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,010
- Bloody hell. - He was thorough.

395
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,320
- Oh, god. - Oh, god.

396
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,510
Plane's on uneven ground. Could just be settling.

397
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,870
Or the other thing.

398
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,210
Get to work.

399
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,180
Clear.

400
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,370
<i>Ward, help!</i>

401
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,330
Quiet.

402
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,400
<i>Help!</i>

403
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,630
Seems like a hardware issue, not firmware.

404
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,000
I should be with Hannah, anyway. No wonder she keeps screaming in there.

405
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,150
You keep sending in the Cavalry, you're bound to get a reaction like that.

406
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,140
- Don't... don't call her that. - Why not?

407
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,850
No normal person can shoot 100 Bahrain...

408
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:25,030
- That's not how it went down. - Whatever, 20.

409
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,050
- I just... I don't understand... - She didn't have a gun.

410
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,760
None of us did.

411
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,160
And it wasn't a rescue or an assault,

412
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,150
whatever they say at the academy these days.

413
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:40,450
We were the welcome wagon. And it went South.

414
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,180
- How many... - Plenty.

415
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,910
A civilian girl and a few of our guys were stuck inside a building,

416
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:58,770
being held by the followers of this gifted individual...

417
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,370
or worshippers. We never found out.

418
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:06,860
May did.

419
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,620
She took it upon herself to get them out.

420
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,360
Said she could fix the problem.

421
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:22,030
So she went in, crossed off the enemy force.

422
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,810
- Didn't say how. - Did she lose anyone in there?

423
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:35,220
Herself. May used to be different.

424
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,880
She was always quiet, she just...

425
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,820
she was warm.

426
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,420
Fearless in a different way, getting in trouble,

427
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,030
<i>pulling pranks, thought rules were meant to be broken.</i>

428
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,310
<i>Sound familiar?</i>

429
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,020
But when she walked out of that building...

430
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,670
it was like that part of her was gone.

431
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,310
<i>I tried to comfort her,</i>

432
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,380
but she wouldn't tell me what went down in there.

433
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,660
What did you say?

434
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,680
I said the words I thought she needed to hear.

435
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,640
It's why you want her on the plane...

436
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,540
to see if that person is still in there somewhere.

437
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,950
The lock is jammed.

438
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,340
Let me in or let her out.

439
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,230
- That's not up to us. - Let her out!

440
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,850
Talk to me. What's happening?

441
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:57,580
<i>May, he's disappearing. He's passing between worlds.</i>

442
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,490
It seems a little less of him is returning every time he appears.

443
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,990
But why is he after you guys?

444
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,150
Because he can't get to Hannah in there. She's safe.

445
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,550
If we wait it out, maybe he'll disappear fully.

446
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,950
- What are you going to do? - Fix the problem.

447
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,730
We got to find a way out of here. Any of this crap still work?

448
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,850
<i>There he is.</i>

449
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:04,020
- What happened? - Well, we lost communication.

450
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,450
And you were hit with a very large plumber's wrench.

451
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,880
- A wrench? - Yeah.

452
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,170
That guy's traveling back and forth between alien worlds with a wrench?

453
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,800
Must have been in his hand when the blast hit.

454
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,860
Not the kind of wrench you would use to loosen a coupling, is it?

455
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:24,960
<i>...there?</i> <i>Maybe it doesn't work after all.</i>

456
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,680
<i>Uh, yes, yes, we're here, sir. Where'd you go?</i>

457
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,070
Nowhere. We were attacked, locked in,

458
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,710
then the guy disappeared.

459
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,250
- Hey, that's our story. - Is May with you guys?

460
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,820
She isn't with you?

461
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,550
I don't mean to scare you, I just need to use you as bait.

462
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,200
Well, that's comforting.

463
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,960
To draw him out, away from my people.

464
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,900
Then what will you do?

465
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,870
Whatever I have to.

466
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,880
You're sure this is how to do it?

467
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,640
Yes. I'll max the signal,

468
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,580
and the transceiver will act as a trigger.

469
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,830
Okay, fine.

470
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,280
They only made 20, I think.

471
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,280
<i>So, we believe that this man is responsible for the blast?</i>

472
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,930
<i>Skye said she thinks he's the worker who filed all the reports.</i>

473
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,790
<i>Tobias Ford. It looks like him.</i>

474
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,740
It makes no sense for a man to complain about safety issues

475
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,670
- whilst causing them. Another theory is...
- Theories don't matter.

476
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,240
Only facts, and the fact is,

477
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,200
a bullet will take you out of whatever world you're in.

478
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,490
Any idea which direction may could've taken her?

479
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,680
We'll deploy the golden retrievers. They're in here.

480
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,060
Fitz! This is no time for childish nonsense like this!

481
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,120
Pranking was your idea.

482
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,350
And obviously, I rigged this little beauty

483
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:57,770
before I knew there was a dimension-jumping psychopath in the mix. - Wait, childish.

484
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,200
- This guy is childish. - What are you getting at?

485
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,190
Tobias. Is that you?

486
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,880
He wanted her to notice him.

487
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,730
Why would he file a complaint to her office when there was

488
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:38,680
nothing wrong and then cause an actual safety issue himself?

489
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,560
To get her fired?

490
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,340
To get her attention, to spend time with her. Think about it...

491
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,210
he scared the guy who was harassing her at the airport.

492
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:47,740
- He tried to hit you with a cop car. - When we took her into custody.

493
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,610
Yeah, he's not trying to hurt her.

494
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:54,760
- He's trying to protect her. - He likes her.

495
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,080
Stay here.

496
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,040
It's okay. It's okay.

497
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:46,140
- Tell him I won't hurt you. - Tobias, wait, she's a friend.

498
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,070
- Hannah. - You have to stop.

499
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:56,230
- Please. - Listen, we believe you're trapped between two worlds...

500
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,840
- this world... - And hell.

501
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,040
I'm being dragged to hell for what I did.

502
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,490
What did you do?

503
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,650
Just loosen a few bolts, and then you'd visit.

504
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,220
It was the best part of my day.

505
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,710
I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.

506
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,940
Oh, no. Tobias.

507
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:29,350
- How could you? - I killed them. I know.

508
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,130
And even worse, everyone started blaming you.

509
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,690
- I tr... I tried to stop them. - But you hurt more people.

510
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,290
I was trying to protect you from them,

511
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,910
<i>trying to atone from my sin. Hannah, please,</i>

512
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,920
maybe if you forgive me, I won't go to hell.

513
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,950
- Only god can forgive you. - And he won't.

514
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,830
You can't undo what's been done. That will be with you forever.

515
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,350
But trying to hold on to this life,

516
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:07,930
<i>clinging to the person you thought you could be, that's hell.</i>

517
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,620
And you're dragging her down with you.

518
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,970
You have to let go before my people come and make you do it.

519
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,770
<i>If you care about her, and I know you do,</i>

520
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,050
let her go.

521
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,810
<i>Let the girl go, Tobias.</i>

522
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,130
Let the girl go.

523
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,320
<i>- Are you okay? - Yes.</i>

524
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,550
What did you say to him?

525
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,300
Same words you said to me in Bahrain.

526
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,680
- She all right? - Much better.

527
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,330
Let me know if she needs anything.

528
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,340
- Can Fitz repair it? - No. This one's a lost cause.

529
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,450
But May isn't.

530
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,510
<i>If anyone can bring her around, it's you.</i>

531
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,140
You know what makes people tick. Pun intended.

532
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:24,760
So do you. You see the good in them.

533
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,440
You were a friend to Hannah,

534
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,070
you can't wait to get inside May's head,

535
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,750
and you figured out Tobias without even trying.

536
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,210
Guess I'm full of surprises.

537
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,560
But this isn't one of them. I wanted you paying close attention

538
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,150
to the index asset evaluation and intake process

539
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,170
because someday, you'll be really good at it...

540
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,050
even the best.

541
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:55,880
- Thanks, A.C. - Maybe you'll get to rename it.

542
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,410
Good, because that name is super stupid.

543
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,270
I know.

544
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,120
Mind if I keep you company?

545
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,260
Cool.

546
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,540
<i>We'll return in a moment.</i>

547
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,220
AGLET

548
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,480
- Ta-da! - That isn't a word in our language.

549
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,660
- I've never heard of it. - I'm checking.

550
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,860
Our language?

551
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,060
You mean the English language, first spoken in England?

552
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:09,740
"Aglet... a plastic or metal tube covering the end of a shoelace. "

553
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,500
Oh, come on.

554
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,340
- She used her Britishness against us. - It's a word.

555
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,060
It's not funny. I was sleeping peacefully.

556
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:27,210
- Very clever, Simmons. - I didn't... I didn't do it.

557
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:31,820
- Well, Ward, I don't appreciate... - Don't look at me!

558
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,080
- Okay, well, Skye... - No.

559
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:41,890
<i>Well, who, then? Look, the bunks should be off-limits, okay?</i>

560
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:45,400
<i>Don't laugh! Because I know it was one of you.</i>

561
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:51,360
