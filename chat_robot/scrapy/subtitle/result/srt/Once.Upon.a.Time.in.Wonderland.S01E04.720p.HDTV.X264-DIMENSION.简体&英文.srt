1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,540
没人相信爱丽丝
No one believed Alice

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,330
所说的仙境冒险
when she spoke of her adventures in Wonderland,

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,060
她是如何爱上精灵塞勒斯
of how she fell in love with a genie named Cyrus,

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,870
红心王后又是如何拆散他们的
and how the Red Queen tore them apart.

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,890
不
No!

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,940
爱丽丝  她需要帮助
Alice. She needs help.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,910
所以红桃杰克和我带她回了仙境
So the Knave of Hearts and I brought her back to Wonderland

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,280
寻找她的真爱
to search for her true love.

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,160
他在这里  我能感觉到
He's here. I can feel it.

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,350
有人想阻止她
There are those who will try to stop her.

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,340
让那个女孩许下三个愿
What we want can't be accomplished

12
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,220
我们的目的才能达成
until the girl's made all her wishes.

13
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,200
但是爱丽丝的伟大冒险
But Alice's greatest adventure

14
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,640
刚刚开始
has just begun.

15
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,760
《仙境奇缘》前情提要
Previously in Wonderland...

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,090
这里怎么了
What happened here?

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,630
猛兽来袭过
Bandersnatch attacked.

18
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,000
-你杀了它吗  -没有
- Did you kill it? - No.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,460
是个年轻女子  和一个男人
It was a young woman and a man.

20
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,730
这个男人是谁
Who was this man?

21
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,270
她叫他"杰克"
She called him "Knave."

22
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,310
告诉我  杰克  安娜斯塔西娅是谁
So, tell me, Knave, who's Anastasia?

23
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,330
这是个心碎的故事
That is a tale of heartbreak.

24
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,430
我爱你  安娜斯塔西娅
I love you, Anastasia.

25
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,170
我爱你  威尔・史卡利
I love you, Will Scarlet.

26
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,080
阿格拉巴
多年前

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,910
男孩
Boy!

28
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,030
男孩  火要灭了
Boy, the fire's dying!

29
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,160
小崽子
Boy!

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,970
没有煤了  我得去...
There was no coal left. I had to go--

31
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,550
不要找借口
No excuses!

32
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,650
我真该把你丢回那条发现你的阴沟
I should throw you back in the gutter where I found you!

33
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,240
不要  求你了
No! Please!

34
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,270
今晚又不想吃饭了是吧
Maybe another night without food

35
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,600
也许这样能提醒你更好地干活儿
will remind you to be better prepared!

36
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,080
男孩  男孩
Boy! Boy!

37
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,030
转过来
Turn away!

38
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,340
转过来
Turn away!

39
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,600
男孩  她会让我们原地烧起来的
Boy! She'll burn us where we stand!

40
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,310
抱歉来打扰您
I'm sorry to disturb you.

41
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,120
-我...  -你在集市干活
- I-- - You work at the market.

42
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,620
是的
Yes.

43
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,170
来敲我的门干什么
What are you doing at my door?

44
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,500
我想知道您能不能...
I was wondering if you--

45
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,150
我不是在问你想要什么
I'm not asking what you want.

46
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,330
我是在问你为什么来骚扰我
I'm asking why you'd disturb me.

47
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,270
你一定知道我的能耐
You must know what I can do to you.

48
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,500
对于我即将过上的生活来说
Death would be a kindness

49
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,590
死亡都算是仁慈了
compared to the life I have ahead of me.

50
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,830
我希望您能教我
I want you to teach me.

51
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,410
-教你  -黑魔法
- Teach you? - Dark magic.

52
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,320
这样有一天  人们就会畏惧我
So that one day people will fear me,

53
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,500
就如他们畏惧你一样
as they fear you.

54
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,500
不行
No.

55
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,500
求你了  我会替你干活  听从你的吩咐
Please! I will work for you, do anything you want.

56
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,400
魔法可不只是用来对抗恶棍的
Magic is not something you use to simply fight off bullies.

57
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,930
-我不想...  -那你想怎样
- That's not what-- - Then what is it?

58
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,530
我想报仇
I want revenge.

59
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,170
对谁
On who?

60
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,720
走吧  男孩  免得我...
Go away, boy, before I turn--

61
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,850
苏丹王
The Sultan.

62
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,800
为什么像你这样的人
And why would someone like you

63
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,110
会和苏丹王扯上关系
have any concern with the Sultan?

64
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,660
因为  他是我父亲
Because... he's my father.

65
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,610
是真的吗
Is this true?

66
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,220
两个人之间最重要的就是诚信
There's nothing more important between two people than honesty.

67
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,550
在我看来  你可不像皇族
To my eyes, you look nothing like royalty.

68
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,850
他抛弃了我
He abandoned me!

69
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,270
苏丹王为什么要抛弃自己的亲骨肉
Why would the Sultan abandon his own flesh and blood?

70
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,160
因为他说  我是他的私生子
Because, as he says, I am his bastard.

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,940
我恨他入骨
I hate him with the fire of a thousand suns!

72
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,350
总算
Finally...

73
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,320
你说实话了
honesty.

74
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,830
你叫什么  男孩
What's your name, boy?

75
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,920
贾法尔
Jafar.

76
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,290
好吧  贾法尔
Well, Jafar,

77
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,270
明天我们来看看你有什么本事
tomorrow we will begin to see what you can do.

78
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,940
美丽至极
Fabulous.

79
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,400
有样东西叫前门  亲爱的
There's a thing called the front door, darling.

80
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,290
你真该试一试
You really must try it sometime.

81
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,180
我觉得秘密见面
I thought making our interactions secret

82
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,600
更合你的意
would be more to your liking.

83
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,330
毕竟  保密是你的习惯
After all, secrets seem to be a habit of yours.

84
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,170
对对的  对对得  你们退下吧
Tweedles, begone, dears.

85
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,020
两个人之间
There's nothing more important

86
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,550
最重要的
between two people

87
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,550
就是诚信
than honesty.

88
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,650
你不同意吗
Wouldn't you agree?

89
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,380
什么事
What's this about?

90
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,130
你为什么不告诉我爱丽丝带了朋友来仙境
Why didn't you tell me Alice brought a friend to Wonderland?

91
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,920
这个红桃杰克
This Knave of Hearts.

92
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,500
因为这是无关紧要的小细节
'Cause it was an inconsequential detail.

93
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,940
他只不过是个懦弱的小偷
He's nothing but a cowardly thief.

94
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,960
我们无需担心他
He's of very little concern to us.

95
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,920
其实  他造成了很大的麻烦
Actually, he's caused a great deal of trouble,

96
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,830
要我说  他的出现需要引起大大的重视
so I'd say his presence is of great concern.

97
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,110
你为什么带他来
Why did you bring him?

98
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,640
因为事情不是
Because it wasn't quite as simple

99
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,270
给爱丽丝送一张邀请函那样简单
as sending Alice an invitation.

100
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,550
不然你一个人就能搞定了
Otherwise, you'd have done it yourself.

101
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,650
我需要爱丽丝信任的人
I needed someone that Alice trusted,

102
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,670
这个人刚好就是杰克
and that someone happened to be the Knave.

103
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,350
他起了作用
He served his purpose.

104
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,920
现在他的任务完成了
And now his purpose is done.

105
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,290
正是
Precisely.

106
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,660
那就没问题了
Then there's no issue.

107
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,270
除掉他
Eliminate him.

108
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,620
把他驱逐出场
Remove him from the playing field.

109
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,760
去找红心王后是个糟糕的主意  爱丽丝
Going after the Red Queen is a bad idea, Alice.

110
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,960
她偷走了塞勒斯的瓶子
She stole Cyrus' bottle.

111
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,080
唯一合理的解释就是塞勒斯也在他手上
It only stands to reason that she has Cyrus as well.

112
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,650
所以你打算只身一人去追踪她的军队吗
So you're gonna go after the entire red army by yourself?

113
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,970
如果有必要的话
If that's what it takes.

114
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,070
-有更聪明的法子  -有吗
- There's a smarter way to do this. - Is there now?

115
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,930
打出你手上有的牌  爱丽丝
Play the hand you've been dealt, Alice.

116
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,460
我看过你的牌  杰克  没有几张
I've seen your cards, Knave, and they're quite lacking.

117
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,550
正是虚张声势的时候
Which is exactly the time to start bluffing.

118
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,010
白兔...
Look, the White Rabbit--

119
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,280
他还不知道我们知道他在为王后效力
he has no idea we know he's working for the Queen.

120
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,250
我们得利用这一点
We need to use that to our advantage,

121
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,350
骗他告诉我们塞勒斯在哪里
fool him into telling us where Cyrus is.

122
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,350
或者我们可以提起他的双脚
Or we could just pick him up by the feet,

123
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,250
把他挂在悬崖边  直到他告诉我们所知的一切
dangle him over a cliff until he tells us everything he knows.

124
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,620
-你最好别这么一本正经的  -那边
- We need to work on your poker face. - Over here!

125
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,720
-你听到了吗  -听到了
- Did you hear that? - I did.

126
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,410
有人在跟踪我们
Oh. Someone's following us.

127
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,440
听这声音  看来有不少人
By the sounds of things, I'd say several someones.

128
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,940
你认识他们吗
Do you recognize them?

129
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,760
是毛虫的人
They work for the Caterpillar.

130
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,440
-他们是搜捕队  -我们有什么选择
- They're collectors. - What are our options?

131
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,150
基本上我们可以去死  也可以逃跑
Well, basically, we could die, or we could run.

132
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,280
我不大喜欢第一种
I don't particularly care for the first one.

133
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,050
我也不喜欢  左边还是右边
Me, neither. Left or right?

134
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,120
-左边  -好
- Left. - Okay.

135
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,450
他去哪里了
Where'd he go?!

136
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,060
快追他
After him!

137
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,650
他逃跑了
He's getting away!

138
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,700
他跑了
Getting away!

139
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,870
他们找的是我  我们该分头行动
I'm the one they want. We should split up.

140
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,070
我们应该留下来战斗
We should stay and fight.

141
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,450
更好的主意  你留在这里  我去引开他们
Oh, better idea-- you stay, I go.

142
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,110
这边
Oi! Over here!

143
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,710
-威尔  不要  -我会没事的
- Will, no! - I'll be fine.

144
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,470
我对这片森林了如指掌
I know these woods like the back of my hand--

145
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,030
-我没事  拼图森林见  -威尔
- I'm fine! Meet you back in Tulgey. - Will!

146
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,400
没事  塞勒斯  好事多磨
It's okay, Cyrus. This is just a detour.

147
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,040
我们很快就能在一起了
I'll be with you soon.

148
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,420
行行好吧  先生
Please, sir.

149
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,760
-我好几天没吃饭了  -你该在犯错前
- I haven't eaten for days. - You should have thought of that

150
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,000
就想到这一点
before you did whatever it is you did.

151
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,200
你说得对  我犯了十分严重的错误
You're right. I-I've made some terrible mistakes,

152
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,720
但我饿死了
but I'm starving.

153
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,360
你能不能分我一根骨头  让我尝尝味道
Could you even just spare a bone? Just a little taste?

154
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,120
看看上面还有没有肉吧
See if you can find a morsel out of that.

155
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,980
我们被关在这里这么多天
In all the days we've been here together,

156
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,670
我从没见过你像那样祈求过任何东西
I've never seen you grovel like that for anything,

157
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,700
更别说是食物了
let alone food.

158
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,210
那是因为我对食物不感兴趣
That's because I'm not interested in food.

159
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,310
你想要骨头吗
You wanted the bone?

160
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,540
这是一根如愿叉骨
It's a wishbone.

161
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,480
你打算许个愿逃离这里吗
You're going to wish yourself out of this place?

162
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,540
类似吧
Something like that.

163
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,470
我们一定跟丢了他  你走这边
We must have missed him! You go this way!

164
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,670
我走后面
I'll go the back!

165
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,910
沿着岸找
Look along the bank!

166
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,240
爱丽丝
Alice?

167
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,970
你真觉得
Did you really think

168
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,020
她有那个能耐  一个人搞定这些吗
that she could do this all by herself?

169
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,890
该死
Bloody hell.

170
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,260
你好  威尔
Hello, Will.

171
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,870
阿格拉巴

172
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,760
我爬到岩壁下
And so... so I'm scrambling

173
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,220
试图救他
down the rock face to try and save him,

174
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,290
这只蠢羊看见一丛灌木
when the stupid goat-- he sees a shrub.

175
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,250
还没鹰嘴豆大
No bigger than a chickpea,

176
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,470
但他就是得吃  他走了一步
but he just has to eat it. He takes one step...

177
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,620
就摔了下去...
down right...

178
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,390
永远也不能低估
One can never underestimate the stupidity

179
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,300
-山羊的愚蠢和吃货精神啊  -是啊
- or the appetite of a goat. - Yes.

180
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,100
谢谢你救了他  艾其尔
Well, thanks for saving him, Akil--

181
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,410
尽管他不配
even if he didn't deserve it.

182
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,150
这是我的工作
Well, it is my job.

183
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,890
这袋酒是给你的
We have this wine for you

184
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,040
这是对你辛劳工作的奖赏
as a reward for your good work.

185
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,290
谢谢你  贾法尔
Oh... thank you, Jafar.

186
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,290
请你放心
May you rest easy.

187
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,380
不  还不是时候
No, not yet.

188
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,980
你什么时候才能让我学习那本书里的咒语
When are you going to let me study the spells inside that book?

189
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,990
等你准备好的时候
When you're ready.

190
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,040
而现在你还没准备好
Which, as of now, you're not.

191
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,960
不过  是时候该教你
It is, however, time for me to teach you

192
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,370
掩蔽咒语了
the masking spell,

193
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,430
你不是很想学吗
which you've been so eager to learn.

194
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,680
你不是说过学不了那个咒语的吗
But I thought you said we couldn't,

195
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,960
因为需要人的肝脏
because it requires a human liver.

196
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,360
确实如此  但你刚刚给弄到一个
It does, but you've just gotten us one.

197
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,970
你给艾其尔的那袋酒...被下过毒
The wine you gave Akil-- it was poisoned.

198
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,120
他马上就要命丧黄泉了
He'll be dead any moment now.

199
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,170
艾其尔什么都没做错
But Akil did nothing!

200
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,540
确实如此
Quite right.

201
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,130
他是个好人
He's a fine man.

202
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,120
这是毒药的解药
And this is the antidote to the poison.

203
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,740
如果愿意  你把它可以交给他
If you wish, you can give it to him.

204
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,720
但如果你给了他  我们就没有人肝了
But if you do, we won't have the liver.

205
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,760
你就不能学咒语了
And you won't be able to learn the spell.

206
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,730
你知道这是什么吗  贾法尔
Do you know what this is, Jafar?

207
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,870
-一条蛇  -你知道为什么
- A serpent. - Do you know why

208
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,440
我在周围摆满这种生物的装饰吗
I surrounded myself with such creatures?

209
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,340
不知道
No.

210
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,100
因为它们其中蕴藏的真谛
It is because of their true essence.

211
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,650
它们最重要的能力
Their most important quality--

212
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,210
就是必要之时
that when they need to,

213
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,050
可以蜕皮  重获新生
they shed their skin and are reborn.

214
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,930
这就是你要做的  贾法尔
And that is what you need to do, Jafar.

215
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,980
放任无辜的人死去吗
By letting an innocent die?

216
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,930
是向我展示
By showing me

217
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,830
你会不惜一切代价
that you're willing to do whatever's necessary

218
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,290
争取你想要的东西
to get what you want.

219
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,510
你会吗
Are you?

220
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,590
还是说  你还是那个
Or are you still just that little boy

221
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,920
来到我门前的
who came to my door,

222
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,880
仅有一腔怒火的小男孩
full of anger but little else?

223
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,530
现在我们知道了
Well, now we know.

224
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,400
祝贺你  贾法尔
Congratulations, Jafar.

225
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,720
你重获新生了
You are reborn.

226
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,550
大人
Sire?

227
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,510
她抓到他了
She's got him--

228
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,690
红桃杰克
the knave of hearts.

229
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,790
他们正押送他回宫殿
They're on their way back to the palace.

230
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,050
好极了
Excellent.

231
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,480
还有什么事要我为您效劳吗
Is there anything else I can do for you?

232
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,560
不了  下面的事就交给我吧
No. I shall take it from here.

233
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,510
记得提醒我奖赏你的好表现
Remind me to reward you for your good work.

234
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,290
当然
Of course.

235
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,070
你不该回仙境来的  威尔
You should never have come back to wonderland, Will.

236
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,010
你的女朋友爱丽丝给了你什么
So what did your girlfriend Alice offer you

237
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,870
这么吸引你  甚至战胜了你的生存本能
that was enticing enough for you to overcome your survival instincts, hmm?

238
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,280
她不是我的女朋友
She's not me girlfriend.

239
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,290
我可不喜欢善良又普通的女人
I'm clearly not attracted to nice, normal women.

240
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,540
你这几年都在忙什么呢  威尔
What have you been up to all these years, Will?

241
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,060
还在乞讨  借钱  偷窃吗
Still begging, borrowing, and stealing?

242
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,510
真了解我
Bloody hell.

243
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,220
也许你能骗过所有人
Maybe you've fooled all these people

244
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,290
让他们相信你是什么王后
into believing you're some kind of queen...

245
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,070
但我知道你的真实身份
but I know who you really are...

246
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,780
安娜斯塔西娅
Anastasia.

247
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,240
你从来不知道什么时候该消停  是吧  威尔
You never did know when to stop fighting, did you, Will?

248
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,800
你打算把我关在这多久
How long are you gonna keep me in here?

249
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,480
不如先关一辈子
How about we start with forever

250
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,290
剩下的事以后再说
and work our way back from there?

251
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,020
他不在里面
He's not in there.

252
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,560
谁不在里面
Who's not in there?

253
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,030
你在找杰克  对吗
You're looking for the knave, right?

254
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,900
他不在里面
He ain't in there.

255
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,880
你怎么知道
How do you know?

256
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,120
如果他在里面
'Cause if he was,

257
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,020
我就会在里面收取报酬了
I'd be inside collecting a reward.

258
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,160
你也是在追捕队的
You're one of those collectors

259
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,640
你也在找他
that was chasing him.

260
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,510
而且很不幸  还没抓到他
And, unfortunately, not the one catching him.

261
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,530
等等  有人抓到他了吗
Wait. Did someone catch him?

262
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,840
我可以告诉你  但是你看啊
I could tell ya. But, you see, I got this thing

263
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,170
有人用剑指着我的时候
where it's hard for me to be straight with people

264
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,650
我很难坦言相告
pointing swords at me.

265
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,930
红心王后抓到他了
The Red Queen got him.

266
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,850
-你确定吗  -确定
- Are you quite sure? - Oh, yeah.

267
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,360
这些伤就是证据
I got the bruises to prove it.

268
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,070
我知道我该怎么做了
Well, I know what I have to do.

269
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,850
谢谢你  小姐...
Thank you, miss...

270
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,910
伊丽莎白
Elizabeth.

271
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,160
但大多数人叫我丽莎尔
But most people call me Lizard.

272
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,490
我叫爱丽丝
Alice.

273
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,020
祝我好运吧
Wish me luck.

274
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,370
等等  你要去追他吗
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. You going after him?

275
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,020
不  是"她"
No. I'm going after her.

276
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,820
红心王后  你一个人是进不去的
The Red Queen? You can't go in there by yourself.

277
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,640
为什么每个人都这么说
Why does everybody keep telling me that?

278
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,850
因为这是事实
Maybe 'cause it's true.

279
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,110
好吧  管他的  我和你一起去
Fine. Hell with it. I'm coming with you.

280
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,470
我好像没请你这么做
I'm quite certain I didn't ask you to.

281
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,560
不管怎样
Whatever.

282
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,590
杰克欠我的  而且死人可不能还债
The Knave owes me, and, uh, dead men can't pay debts.

283
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,520
恭喜你  陛下
Congratulations, majesty.

284
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,570
恭喜什么
About what?

285
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,420
这么快就抓到了杰克
Such a quick capture of the knave.

286
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,930
消息传得真快
News travels fast.

287
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,670
确实如此
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

288
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,920
我只是想问  为什么他还活着
But I just have to ask, why is he still breathing?

289
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,350
-你说谁  -杰克
- Pardon? - The Knave.

290
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,290
我知道他被你关在地牢里
I understand he's locked in your dungeon.

291
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,120
我只是好奇为什么
I was just curious as to why that is.

292
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,820
我们想要除掉他  现在他已经被除掉了
We wanted him "Removed." He's "Removed."

293
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,570
但把他关在暗无天日的地牢
But he's no use to us locked away

294
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,160
对我们毫无用处
where no one can see him.

295
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,880
你想让我把他绑起来示众吗  没问题
You want me to put him outside in the gallows? Fine--

296
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,330
我要你砍下他的头
I want you to put his head on the chopping block!

297
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,440
公开处决
A public execution

298
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,280
这样  每个人都会看到帮助爱丽丝的下场
So everyone will see the price for helping Alice in wonderland.

299
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,000
贾法尔  你难道不知道
Did it ever occur to you, Jafar,

300
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,350
对我们来说  让他活着比死了更有用
that he might be more useful to us alive than dead?

301
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,360
对我们更有用
More use to us...

302
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,830
还是对你更有用
or more use to you?

303
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,440
你在暗示什么吗
Do you have something to say?

304
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,710
你就没事要告诉我吗
Do you?

305
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,170
你先是忘了告诉我杰克在帮助爱丽丝
First you forget to tell me this knave was helping Alice,

306
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,160
现在你又不愿杀了他
now you seem reluctant to kill him.

307
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,080
这让我不禁好奇
It makes me wonder if

308
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,800
你的不作为是不是另有隐情
perhaps there's a reason for your inaction.

309
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,370
是时候看看你是不是一个
It's time to find out if you're a woman

310
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,280
为得到想要的东西
who's prepared to do whatever it takes

311
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,810
可以不惜一切代价的女人
to get what she wants,

312
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,280
还是只是一个
or just a little girl

313
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,530
除了偷来的王冠  而一无所有的小女孩
with a stolen crown and nothing else.

314
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,110
这一次  让我看清楚
Let me be clear this time.

315
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,670
杀了他
Kill him.

316
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,580
这本书包含了世间所有
This book contains all the world's wisdom

317
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,310
关于精灵的知识
about genies.

318
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,130
精灵
Genies?

319
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,270
这就是你一直以来拒绝与我分享的秘密
That's what you've refused to share with me all this time?

320
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,870
我得等到你准备好
Well, I had to wait until you were ready.

321
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,710
现在你准备好了
And you are.

322
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,610
这本书里的咒语
Inside these pages is a spell

323
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,620
只有拥有三只精灵的力量
that only the power of the three genies

324
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,110
才能施放
will allow us to cast.

325
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,150
这个咒语非常强大  即使是我
A spell so powerful that even I,

326
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,230
用上我所有的魔力  也无法独自施展
with all my magic, could not attempt alone.

327
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,390
但现在我有了一个搭档
But now that I have a partner...

328
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,210
什么样的咒语会这么难
What kind of spell could be so difficult

329
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,880
需要我们两个才能进行
that it requires both of us?

330
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,670
如果成功了
One that, if we succeed,

331
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,150
我们将成为世界上最强大的巫师
will make us the most powerful sorcerers the world has ever known.

332
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,380
我们将能改变魔法规则
We will be able to change the very laws of magic.

333
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,100
一旦做到这一点
And once we do that...

334
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,940
一切都唾手可得
all we desire will be at our fingertips.

335
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,120
你愿意将这一切与我分享
And you wish to share this with me?

336
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,960
你的慷慨
Your generosity--

337
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,000
我不知道该如何报答
I don't know how I could ever repay it.

338
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,400
我等待了无数岁月
I have waited many, many years

339
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,990
寻找值得这一切的人  贾法尔
to find someone worthy of this, Jafar.

340
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,750
就像你等待了那么多年
Just as you have waited years to seek your revenge

341
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,190
去向抛弃你的父亲
not only on your father who cast you out,

342
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,560
和所有那些轻视你
but on all those who ever... belittled you...

343
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,640
或怀疑你的人复仇
or doubted you.

344
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,830
没人对我这么友善过
No one has ever shown me such kindness.

345
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,380
也没有人
No one...

346
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,710
像我这样深爱你
has ever loved you like I do.

347
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,120
就快成功了
Almost there.

348
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,780
你在做什么
What are you doing?

349
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,160
-你说什么  -举起你的双手
- Excuse me? - Show me your hands.

350
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,790
我不懂
I don't understand.

351
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,910
我看到你手里拿着东西
You're holding something. I saw it.

352
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,700
举起你的双手
Show me your hands.

353
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,580
很好
All right.

354
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,820
很锋利
Sharp.

355
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,630
磨了很长时间吧
Must have taken you a long time.

356
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,390
王后的宫殿是个陷阱密布的地方
The queen's palace is a tricky place.

357
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,380
我知道  我
I know. I, uh,

358
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,510
每半年左右就去双胞胎兄弟那扒一次
pickpocket the tweedles every six months or so.

359
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,970
你从未被逮到吗
And you never got caught?

360
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,310
名师出高徒嘛
Learned from the best.

361
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,890
-是红桃杰克吗  -当然了
- The Knave? - Of course.

362
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,120
你这么做  不是为了
You're not doing this for repayment

363
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,840
要追回债务吧
of a financial debt, are you?

364
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,200
我当时在街上
I was on the streets.

365
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,960
他收留了我  给我一瓦遮头
He took me in, gave me a place to sleep.

366
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,480
教会了我这一身本领
Taught me everything I know.

367
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,490
很遗憾听到这些
Well, sorry to hear that.

368
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,130
走吧  我知道他有时很难相处
Come on, I know he can be difficult,

369
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,630
可是他心地善良  这要谢谢你了
but his heart's in the right place, thanks to you.

370
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,040
听起来你俩曾是亲密好友
Sounds like you two were close friends.

371
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,400
除非  等等  你俩是否
Unless... wait, were you two...

372
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,430
不   不是
No. Uh, no.

373
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,580
我绝对不会
I mean... I would never...

374
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,010
威尔和我  我们只是一起跑路
Will and I-- we just ran together.

375
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,300
一起偷东西
You know, stealing.

376
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,640
有时是为了毛虫
Sometimes for the Caterpillar, and...

377
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,460
有时只是为了好玩
sometimes just for fun.

378
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,500
你们以抢劫他人为乐吗
You'd rob people for fun?

379
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,840
自从安娜斯塔西娅的事情之后
Will kind of went through a dark period

380
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,870
威尔经历了一段黑暗的时期
after the whole Anastasia thing.

381
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,240
又是这个  安娜斯塔西娅
There's that name again-- Anastasia.

382
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,350
这个女孩到底是何方神圣
Who is this girl?

383
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,610
从未见过  但不管她是谁
Never met her, but whoever she is,

384
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,890
她都彻底毁了他
she completely wrecked him.

385
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,960
人们都说威尔离开仙境是因为他债台高筑
Everyone says Will left Wonderland 'cause of his debts,

386
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,350
但我并不这么看
but I don't think so.

387
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,410
这地方令他想起她
This place reminded him of her.

388
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,000
我想他只是再也承受不了了
I think he just couldn't take it anymore.

389
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,050
你来这里干嘛
What are you doing here?

390
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,640
我以为成为王后的好处
I thought the whole point of becoming queen

391
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,790
就是再也不必亲自动手做那些肮脏的勾当了
was that so you never had to get your hands dirty again.

392
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,320
威尔  那些勾搭还是我做
Will, I still get my hands dirty.

393
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,120
唯一不同的是  现在我可以让别人
The only difference is now I get people

394
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,590
为我动手处理
to clean them off for me.

395
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,500
这么说你只是来幸灾乐祸的吗
So you've just come to gloat?

396
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,020
提醒你自己  多年以前
Remind yourself that you did the right thing

397
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,480
-所做的事都是正确的吗  这不是原因
- all those years ago? - That's not why.

398
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,320
那你究竟为什么来
Then why?

399
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,180
我是来告诉你过几分钟后
I came to tell you that in a few minutes,

400
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,280
白兔会过来告诉你
the white rabbit will be here with instructions

401
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,830
离开仙境的路
to take you out of Wonderland

402
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,540
带你回到他发现你的地方
and back to where he found you.

403
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,200
-是吗  -威尔  我是说真的
- Will he now? - Will, I'm serious.

404
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,490
你这样是为了要我逃跑  再当场逮住我吗
Is this the part where you get to catch me escaping?

405
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,640
然后给自己一个杀我的借口吗
Give you an excuse to kill me?

406
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,980
威尔  我不需要找借口来杀你
Will, I don't need an excuse to kill you.

407
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,110
我需要一个不用杀你的借口
I need an excuse not to kill you.

408
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,730
与我有关联的人想要你死
I'm involved with people who want you dead.

409
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,640
从何时起  你开始照他人的意志来行事了
Since when did you do what anyone told ya?

410
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,430
不是
No.

411
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,380
你还不明白吗
No, you don't understand.

412
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,050
我是想要弥补你
I'm trying to make it up to you.

413
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,670
安娜  我不需要你的同情
I don't need your pity, Anna.

414
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,440
事实上你需要  因为我不同情你的话
Actually, you do, because without my pity,

415
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,730
你将会失去很多东西  包括你的脑袋
you won't have a lot of things, including your head!

416
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,200
所以等兔子来的时候
So when the Rabbit gets here--

417
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,230
我不会走的
I'm not going.

418
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,350
威尔  不要犯傻了
Oh, don't be a fool now, Will.

419
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,700
如果我是傻子  那也是因为你
If I'm a fool, it's only because you made me one.

420
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,700
你是个可怕的人
You're a terrible person

421
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,780
对人心狠手辣
who does terrible things to people.

422
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,080
但是我认为有一件事  就连你也不会做
But I think there's one thing even you won't do.

423
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,460
是什么
What's that?

424
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,840
杀了我
Kill me.

425
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,330
事实上  我打赌你不敢杀我
In fact, I dare you to kill me.

426
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,410
因为在我看来  你没这个胆量
Because personally, I don't think you've got it in ya.

427
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,400
你应该比任何人都清楚
You should know better than anyone

428
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,080
最能保证我动手的方法
that the surest way to make me do something

429
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,290
就是告诉我  我做不到
is to tell me that I can't.

430
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,220
你是做不到
You can't.

431
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,100
打扰一下
Excuse me.

432
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,840
发生什么事了
What's going on here?

433
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,460
马上会有公开行刑
There's gonna be an execution.

434
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,760
请让让
Excuse me?

435
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,750
对不起
Pardon me?

436
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,680
刀剑不长眼
I have a blade.

437
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,680
-上面写了什么  -红桃杰克
- What's it say? - The Knave.

438
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,010
他们要处决他
They're executing him...

439
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,970
今日公开处决
红桃杰克

440
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,390
就在今天
Today.

441
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,400
那辆投石车是用来做什么的
What's the Catapult for?

442
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,370
如果抢到头  就有免费的晚餐
If you catch the head, you get a free dinner.

443
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,400
-射好点  -让他的脑袋飞起来
- Make it a good one! - Make his head fly.

444
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,810
射得真棒
That was a beauty!

445
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,400
依旧如此野蛮
Still barbaric as ever.

446
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,080
为王后欢呼
Hail the queen!

447
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,190
我们得救威尔
We have to save Will.

448
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,250
你有办法吗  貌似已经希望全无了
You have an idea? 'Cause this is looking bleak.

449
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,110
砍掉他的脑袋
Off with his head!

450
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,940
事实上  我有办法
As a matter of fact, I do.

451
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,630
杀掉红桃杰克
Kill the Knave!

452
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,060
你的笑容跑哪去了
Now where's that smile?

453
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,310
你知道王后的样儿
You know the one.

454
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,630
一看到人头落地就会喜笑颜开
The one that loves a good beheading.

455
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,650
这不就是嘛
It's right here.

456
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,650
有什么问题吗  合作伙伴
Anything wrong... partner?

457
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,470
没问题  只是你经常干涉我处理事务
No. Just your constantly interfering with my affairs.

458
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,510
我认为是你的事务
I think it's your affairs

459
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,170
在让我神烦
that are interfering with me.

460
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,990
如果你有话要说
If you've got something to say,

461
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,760
就快点说
spit it out.

462
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,550
爱丽丝来了
Alice is here.

463
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,440
在庭院里
In the courtyard.

464
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,040
叫守卫抓住她
Well, have the guards seize her.

465
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,260
我们不需要她来搞破坏
We don't need her ruining things--

466
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,990
不  只要
No. Just...

467
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,290
只要盯住她就行了
Just keep an eye on her.

468
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,890
是时候让我们看看  她为了达到目的
It's time for us to see how far she's willing to go

469
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,390
愿意付出多大的代价
to get what she wants.

470
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,090
我们打烊了
We are closed.

471
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,720
我不是来喝酒的
I'm not here for a drink.

472
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,700
如果来寻欢  请上楼吧
If it's women you seek, then that's upstairs.

473
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,880
我要你手里的精灵
I want the genie in your possession.

474
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,440
我没有精灵
I don't have a genie--

475
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,140
不必否认了
Don't bother denying it.

476
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,250
谣言传千里
Rumors travel great distances, sir,

477
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,480
特别是那些关于魔法的流言
When magic is involved.

478
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,310
很抱歉  让你千里迢迢地扑了个空
I'm sorry you've come so far for nothing.

479
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,110
我不准备把瓶子交出去
I'm not ready to pass on the bottle.

480
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,640
我还有一个未许的愿望
I still have one more wish to make,

481
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,670
我要留着适当的时候使用
and I'm saving it for just the right thing.

482
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,370
而且我不着急
And I'm in no hurry.

483
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,320
可是我着急
But I am.

484
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,610
你是谁
Who are you?

485
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,960
我将是你最后看到的人
The last person you will ever see

486
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,620
除非你交出我想要的东西
unless you give me what I want.

487
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,340
你瞧
You see...

488
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,080
我会带着精灵离开这里
I will be leaving here with the genie.

489
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,980
但问题是  你还能活着离开这里吗
The question is, will you be leaving here at all?

490
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,200
如果你对精灵如此感兴趣
If you are so interested in genies,

491
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,040
那你就该知道你不能杀了我
then you know you can't kill me.

492
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,580
成为他的新主人的唯一方法就是
The only way for you to become his new master

493
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:14,080
让我许下我所有的愿望
is for me to make all of my wishes.

494
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,370
说得对
You're right.

495
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,180
我是不能杀你
I can't kill you.

496
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,640
但我可以让你痛不欲生
But I can inflict so much pain,

497
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,600
似乎没有任何愿望值得你付出如此的代价
no wish will ever seem worth it.

498
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,190
我许愿你无法伤害到我
I wish that you can do me no harm.

499
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,300
如您所愿
As wishes go,

500
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,170
您真是我见过的最识时务的许愿人
that's one of the wiser ones I've heard.

501
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,810
杂种  滚回地沟里去吧
Go back to the gutter, you bastard.

502
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,270
你说什么
What did you say?

503
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,670
你听到了
You heard me.

504
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,090
是啊  但我想再听你说一次
Perhaps I did, but I'd like to hear you say it again.

505
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,970
你忘记我许下的愿望了吗
Did you forget about my wish?

506
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,060
你再也伤害不了我了
You can't hurt me anymore.

507
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,360
的确是  但是她可以
True, but she can.

508
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,950
求你
Please...

509
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,570
不要杀我  求求你
don't kill me, I beg you.

510
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,840
你会明白  有些事比死亡更痛苦
I think you'll find there are far worse things than death.

511
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,820
现在我们还差一个瓶子了
We're now one bottle away.

512
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,220
敬我们俩
To us.

513
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,900
敬我们俩
To us.

514
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,740
把红心杰克带上来
Bring on the Knave!

515
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,840
杀了他
Kill him!

516
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,000
杀了这个叛徒  杀了红心杰克
Kill the traitor! Kill the Knave!

517
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,070
现在就砍下他的脑袋
Off with his head now!

518
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,960
他就该去死
He deserves to die!

519
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,250
让他付出代价
Make him pay!

520
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,710
我要看着他的头滚下来
I want to see his head roll!

521
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,340
冷静点
Be still.

522
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,970
你们从不清扫这里吗
Don't you ever clean these things?

523
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,780
杀了这个叛徒
Kill the traitor!

524
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,890
-杀了他  -马上杀了他
- Kill him now! - Come on!

525
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,410
这就对了  杀了他
That's it, kill him!

526
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,560
让他好好受受折磨
Make him suffer!

527
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,970
让他人头落地
Off with his head!

528
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,090
出什么事了
What's happening?

529
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,010
老天啊
Bloody hell.

530
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,180
阻止他们
Stop them!

531
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,040
拦住他们
Stop them!

532
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,740
他们想要逃跑
They're trying to escape!

533
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,590
别让他们跑了
Don't let them get away!

534
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,620
我还以为我死定了
I thought I was bolluxed.

535
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,210
如果那个行刑者再高六英寸的话
If that executioner had been 6 inches taller,

536
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,090
你就真死定了
You would have been.

537
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,840
好吧
All right.

538
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,940
我们究竟要怎么离开这里
How the bloody hell do we get out of here?

539
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,360
来吧  走这边
Come on. This way.

540
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,750
丽莎尔  你吓了他一大跳
Lizard, you knocked him out cold.

541
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,780
你们都在想些什么啊
What were you thinking?

542
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,710
你们可能都会送命
You could have both been killed.

543
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,030
一句"谢谢"就好了
A simple "Thank you" would suffice.

544
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,220
谢谢
Thank you.

545
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,870
还有你  lizard
You, too, lizard.

546
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,380
走右边  跟我来
To the right! Follow me!

547
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,340
有人来了
We got company.

548
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,230
-最好赶紧走  -在这里  快来
- We better go. - Over here! Come on!

549
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,830
他们在迷宫里
They're in the maze!

550
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,580
你好  爱丽丝
Hello, Alice.

551
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,930
-这家伙是谁啊  -晚点再跟你解释
- Who the hell is that? - I'll tell you later.

552
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,140
我们得先逃走
We need to get out of here--

553
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,250
这么快就要走了吗
Leaving so soon?

554
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,640
我来掩护  你们快逃
I'll distract 'em. You guys run.

555
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,490
丽兹  不要
Liz, no!

556
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,080
Lizard
Lizard!

557
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,850
我想是正式见面的时候了  我叫...
I suppose it's time we met. My name is--

558
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,350
我知道你是谁  贾法尔
I know who you are, Jafar.

559
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,630
塞勒斯把你的一切都告诉我了
Cyrus has told me all about you.

560
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,670
有意思
Interesting.

561
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,860
我今天也算对你有所了解了  爱丽丝
It seems I've learned a little bit about you today as well, Alice.

562
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,990
你了解我什么了
And what was that?

563
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,410
你愿意为了朋友而做任何事
That you're willing to do anything for a friend.

564
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,870
真让人感动
Quite touching, actually.

565
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,600
停下  他什么也没做
Stop it! He's done nothing!

566
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,760
拜托了  求你
Please, I beg you!

567
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,080
你不需要求我  爱丽丝
You don't have to beg, Alice.

568
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,070
许愿就行了
Just wish.

569
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,240
安娜斯塔西娅
Anastasia...

570
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,210
快许愿  爱丽丝
Just make a bloody wish, Alice!

571
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,170
我许愿  红桃杰克一死
I wish if the Knave of Hearts dies...

572
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,090
我也会立刻死去
then I die!

573
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,910
不要  爱丽丝
Alice, no.

574
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,720
干得好  爱丽丝  干得好
Well played, alice. Well played.

575
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,880
你已经许下一个愿望了  还剩下两个
That's one wish down, and two to go.

576
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,540
除非你杀了我
You'll have to kill me first.

577
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,050
等等
Oh, wait.

578
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,030
你还不能杀我  对吧
You can't now, can you? True.

579
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,300
没错  我需要你活着  这样才能许愿
True. I need you alive to make your wishes.

580
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,900
但我不需要你完好无损
But I don't need you whole.

581
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,530
爱丽丝
Alice...

582
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,530
你只需要许愿让我住手
All you have to do is wish for me to stop,

583
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,980
所有这些痛楚就会停止了
And the pain will go away.

584
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,380
你只需要付出说几个字的代价
Such sweet relief can be yours

585
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,540
就可以得到无比甜蜜的解放
for the bargain price of a few words.

586
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,450
我绝不会让塞勒斯任你摆布
I will never put Cyrus at your mercy.

587
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,830
你确定吗
Are you sure about that?

588
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,370
你只能杀了我  贾法尔
You'll have to kill me, Jafar,

589
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,210
因为我永远不会为你而许愿
'cause I will never, ever wish for you.

590
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,560
爱丽丝  你还好吗
Alice... are you all right?

591
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:57,340
还好
Yes.

592
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,590
走吧
Come on.

593
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,520
趁我们还能动  赶紧离开这里
Let's get out of here while we still can.

594
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,170
我的确不能杀了你们中的任何一个
While it's true I might not be able to kill either of you,

595
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,100
但你得明白  爱丽丝
I think you'll find, Alice,

596
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,290
有些事比死亡更可怕
There are worse things than death.

597
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,700
我动不了了
Can't move.

598
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:15,900
这是怎么了
What's happening?

599
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,430
爱丽丝  这是怎么了
Alice, what's happening?

600
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,140
住手  让他住手
Stop him. Make him stop.

601
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,980
你是对的  王后陛下
You were right, your majesty.

602
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,460
让他活着的确比让他死了更有用
He was more useful alive than dead.

603
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,340
你不会为了自己而许愿  爱丽丝
So you won't use your wishes to help yourself, Alice?

604
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,830
那么我就会摧毁所有你在乎的
Then I will keep destroying all the things you care about,

605
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,850
伤害所有你爱的人
hurting all the people you love...

606
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,770
直到你别无他选
until you have no other choice.

607
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,760
因为你有软肋  爱丽丝
Because you have a weakness, Alice.

608
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,190
今天我已经看出来了
I've seen it today.

609
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,990
你有一颗心
You have a heart.

610
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,510
相信我  我会好好利用这一点的
And trust me, I shall exploit it.

611
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,930
帮帮他
Help him.

612
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,110
我为什么要帮他  亲爱的
Why would I want to do that, darling?

613
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,480
因为你在乎他
Because you care.

614
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,090
你不了解我
You don't know me.

615
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,000
不  我了解你
Yes, I do...

616
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,730
安娜斯塔西娅
Anastasia.

617
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,600
你能够帮助他
You can help him.

618
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,010
能帮助他的是你  用你的愿望
You can help him. Wish!

619
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,000
你要是再这样做  亲爱的  我就...
You keep on doing that, dear, and--

620
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,620
怎样  杀了我  你不能
What? You'll kill me? You can't.

621
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,190
你以为你们占尽优势  但事实并非如此
You think you have the advantage, but you don't.

622
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,810
我的朋友可没有被变成石头
I'm not the one whose friend has turned to stone

623
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,150
我的爱人也没有被监禁
And whose love is in my possession.

624
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,310
现在  你可以继续表现得像
Now... you can carry on behaving like the little girl

625
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,360
我们刚见面时的那个小女孩一样
you were when we very first met.

626
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,980
你也可以赶紧长大
Or you can grow up.

627
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,120
做点符合常理的事情
And do what common sense compels you to do.

628
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,370
反正你知道在哪里可以找到我
Either way, you know where to find me.

629
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:01,810
你不把我关进监牢  折磨我吗
You're not... going to put me in prison, torture me?

630
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,070
若我不遵照你的命令  就让我把牢底坐穿
Let me rot until I do your bidding?

631
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,730
你还没看出来吗  亲爱的
Don't you see, darling?

632
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,580
你已经在监牢里了
You are in prison.

633
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,680
不然你以为仙境是什么
What do you think wonderland is?

634
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,270
你是我的囊中之物  爱丽丝
You're mine, Alice.

635
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,660
从现在起  事情只会变得更糟
And from now on, things are only going to get worse.

636
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,130
直到你完成了自己的任务
Until you do what you must.

637
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,200
许完愿望
Wish.

638
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,350
相信你已经知道了
I'm sure you already know,

639
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,590
你的挚爱今天已许下了她的第一个愿望
But your precious love used her wish today.

640
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,920
你知道这意味着什么
I think you know what that means.

641
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,800
这个笼子很快就会没用了
Soon the cage won't be necessary,

642
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,400
因为你很快就会回到你的归属地
Because you'll be back where you belong--

643
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,940
回到你的瓶子里
In your bottle.

644
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,790
发生什么好事了
What's the occasion?

645
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,710
我听到了传言
I've heard a rumor.

646
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,130
关于第三个精灵吗
The third genie?

647
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,570
他就在阿格拉巴
Right here in agrabah.

648
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,790
为了前两个精灵  我们长途跋涉
With how far we've traveled to get the others,

649
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,490
如今这个可真是让人愉快
that would be a welcome change.

650
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,540
我很自信  我很快就会得到第三个精灵
I'm confident I will soon have the third genie,

651
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,590
然后我就可以准备好施咒了
And then I'll be ready to begin the spell.

652
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,120
你是说我们就可以准备好施咒了
You mean we will be ready to begin the spell.

653
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,170
贾法尔
Jafar?

654
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,380
还记得吗  很久以前
Do you remember a long time ago,

655
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,140
你问过我  为了得到所求之物愿意付出什么
you asked me what I was willing to do in order to get what I want?

656
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,330
你做了什么
What have you done?

657
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,200
这是一剂可以攫取你魔力的魔药
It's a potion to steal your magical essence.

658
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,990
不过估计你早就知道
But then again, you probably know that.

659
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,390
这正是你的书中所记录的
It was in your book.

660
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,410
你是爱我的
You loved me.

661
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:53,970
不
No.

662
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,640
是你爱着我
You loved me.

663
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,880
求你  贾法尔  别这样
Please, Jafar. Don't do this.

664
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,010
你一个人是完成不了这个咒语的
You know you can't complete the spell on your own.

665
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,850
没有一个人可以单独施展这么强大的力量
No one person can achieve that much power alone.

666
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,220
我不是一个人
I won't be alone.

667
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,940
我有你
I'll have you...

668
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,990
还有你的魔力
and your magic.

669
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,580
现在是时候
Now it's time for you,

670
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,350
像你喜爱的毒蛇那样
like the serpent you so admire...

671
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,900
蜕去旧皮了
to shed your skin.

672
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,360
恭喜你  阿玛拉
Congratulations, Amara.

673
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,260
你已经重生了
You are reborn.

674
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,690
你还有一半
You have the other half.

675
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,600
这是个传说  你听过关于如愿骨的传说吗
It's a myth, what you've heard about wishbones--

676
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,130
当如愿骨被一分为二时
That when you break them,

677
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:39,620
手上拿着较大那一半者将得以实现愿望
whoever has the larger half gets a wish.

678
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,810
这是精灵们在很久以前编造出的故事
It's a story, created long ago by genies,

679
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,380
目的是为了让人们相信
to make people believe

680
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,810
他们不必为了满足自己的欲望
That you did not need to seek out a bottle

681
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:57,040
而四处寻找瓶子
in order to someday have what you desire.

682
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,200
而直到今天
And so to this day,

683
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,030
人们还在不停地拆开如愿骨
people keep pulling wishbones apart,

684
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,350
期望有魔力从中喷涌而出
hoping that magic will spill out of them.

685
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,920
但如愿骨真正想要的
But what a wishbone really wants

686
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:14,060
与我们所想要的无二
is no different from what we all want.

687
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,910
那就是与自己的另一半重逢
To be joined to our other half.

688
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:24,470
而一旦与爱人被分离  你会尽其所能
And if we're separated, you will do whatever it takes

689
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,710
与爱人重聚
to be together again.

690
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,180
正如这支如愿骨一样
Just like a wishbone.

691
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,520
仙

692
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,520
境

693
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,520
奇

694
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,520
缘
