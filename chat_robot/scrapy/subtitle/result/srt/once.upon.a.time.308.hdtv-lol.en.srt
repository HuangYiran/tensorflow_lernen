00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,500
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,580
Rumplestiltskin, scared of ending
up just like his coward father

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,610
Papa.No

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,150
A young boy will lead you to your son

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,100
What's going on

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,460
The boy will be your undoing

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,610
Once you drink this water,you
can never leave Neverland

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,750
It's a small price to pay
for what I get in return

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,790
- What do you need him to believe in
-  me

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,280
Inside is where our salvation awaits

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,370
Are you up to the task

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,770
Follow the lady,gents

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,370
A shilling returns two

14
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,620
What

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
Don't feel too bad

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,310
You're not the only one who's
been spurned by the lady tonight

17
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,440
She's been quite shy all evening

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:05,580
You tricked me

19
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,100
How'd she get in there

20
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,320
Please,don't hurt him.He's my father

21
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,250
You'd be better off without him

22
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,930
No,no

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,910
Are you okay

24
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,570
The cost of the game

25
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,170
He didn't even leave me a
shilling for a pint.How rude

26
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,520
He took all of our money

27
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,730
Yes,but I'll figure something out

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,550
I always do... Rumple

29
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,510
Roll up

33
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,450
How is she

34
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,650
I fear she's getting worse,Henry

35
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,270
- But if I save magic... She'll live?
- Yes

36
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,900
But more than that,Henry

37
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,120
If you save magic,you'll save us all

38
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,200
But to do it,you have to truly believe

39
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,000
I do

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,970
Good,because we don't have much time

41
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,480
Follow me

42
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,570
My brothers

43
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,610
Tonight,the dream of Neverland
will awaken from its slumber

44
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,320
Tonight,the heart of the truest
believer shall fulfill its destiny,

45
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,280
and with it our destiny

46
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,670
Tonight,Henry saves magic

47
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,000
You know,despite our differences,

48
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,000
I can always count on you to get
things done... Unlike the rest of them

49
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,360
You were right

50
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,470
They're just a liability

51
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,650
Where are they

52
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,690
Oh,well,Pan told them Neal was alive,
and,of course,Emma took the bait

53
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,030
Such a waste of time

54
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,970
Oh,I'm so sorry

55
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,450
- No,no,don't be. -
He is alive. - What?

56
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,000
Pan wasn't lying

57
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,500
My son is here on the
island.I've seen him

58
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,600
You saw him and you...
you just parted ways

59
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,570
You realize that he might
have a way off the island

60
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,470
Let's worry about the travel
plans after we get Henry

61
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,990
There's something you're not telling me

62
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,430
What happened when you saw him

63
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,530
Look,all you have to know is,the
next time I see him will be

64
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,510
when I'm putting Henry in his arms

65
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,290
When father and son are reunited

66
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,700
Where are we

67
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,950
These nice ladies are going to
look after you for a little while

68
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,300
- You must be the boy...
- Rumplestiltskin

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,280
- Do you know how to spin?
- We can teach you

70
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,040
I... I don't want to stay here

71
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,000
Please,I... I'll be good

72
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,120
This will give me time to get a
real job, so we can be together

73
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,750
We can be together right now

74
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,760
Papa,please.Don't leave me here

75
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,460
Don't be scared now

76
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,200
Hey,I got you a present.A friend

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,760
Someone to be at your side when I'm away

78
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,200
It will be with you when I cannot

79
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,700
- It will?
- Give it a name

80
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,640
Names always make things better

81
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,510
They make them real.Trust me

82
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,040
It will protect you

83
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,390
And I'll be back before you know it

84
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,500
I promise

85
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,830
I'm gonna ask Tink how close
we are to Pan's compound

86
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,920
I don't wanna be surprised
by any lost boys on patrol

87
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,020
Good idea

88
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,020
Looks like you two buried the hatchet

89
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,870
Buried.I don't know

90
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,290
We've at least put it away for now

91
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,760
So you're really gonna
stay here with him

92
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,030
The thought of leaving
you,Emma,it kills me

93
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,870
But there's nothing we can do

94
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,480
If David leaves the island,he'll die

95
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,530
So you're just giving up

96
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,060
Family means being together,all of us

97
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,930
But there's no other way

98
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,450
Maybe this is just you rubbing
off on me, but I don't believe that

99
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,320
There's always a way

100
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,750
Well,if this is your version of a
rescue party, we got here just in time

101
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,750
What are you two doing here

102
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,320
Well,same as you, except
we actually have a chance

103
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,220
Pandora's box

104
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,440
It could trap Pan for eternity
simply by opening the lid

105
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,700
- You didn't tell me my father was with her.
- I didn't know

106
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,420
Wait,your father is the Dark One

107
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,720
Yeah,and he's not getting
anywhere near Henry

108
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,040
- Bae...
- Why?What are you talking about

109
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,530
There's a prophecy that says
that Henry will be his undoing

110
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,790
He didn't come here to protect him

111
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,870
He came here to kill him

112
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,460
That's why you didn't want to
find Neal before you got Henry back

113
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,630
Because you knew he'd spill your secret

114
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,890
Everything I did was to protect
Henry, to rescue him from Pan

115
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,660
It all makes sense

116
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,620
You left before we even made shore

117
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,730
- You wanted to get to Henry first.
- To be on his own

118
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,510
So no one could stop
you... So you can kill him

119
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,500
It's not gonna happen, not unless
you go through all of us first

120
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,600
Someone so young... In such
a short time.Look at him

121
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,610
He could spin for... for
kings and queens one day

122
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,370
- I didn't think I had any talent.
- Oof,more than talent.A gift

123
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,890
You could apprentice
with anyone in the land

124
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,810
If I can make money, then my
father and I can be together

125
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:37,890
Rumple... even with your talent, too
many people know your father is a cheat

126
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,000
And a coward

127
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,500
If you are to have a happy
life, you must go somewhere

128
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,510
where your father's
name cannot follow you

129
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,490
You mean... alone

130
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,630
This bean... can open a portal,
take you far away from this land

131
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,930
Even this realm

132
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,950
You could start a new life

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,650
But it cannot be with your father

134
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,400
But he's coming back for
me as soon as he gets a job

135
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,450
- The truth is,he's at the pub.He doesn't want a job.
- Or real responsibility

136
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,460
Family can be a strength,but
it can also be a burden

137
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,830
And your father will always
be your burden,Rumplestiltskin

138
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,690
You're making a mistake

139
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,270
I don't care if the boy is
destined to be my undoing

140
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,920
I won't hurt him

141
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,990
Because that sounds just like you

142
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,550
Without me,you will fail

143
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,380
I'm the most powerful amongst us

144
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,860
That's why we can't trust you

145
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,540
If I could give you my
dagger,I would But I can't

146
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,920
But you can give me Pandora's box

147
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,490
I don't have to trust
you if I could stop you

148
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:58,540
Son... Look at me, you so much
as lift a finger to perform magic,

149
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,490
you're gonna spend an
eternity in this box

150
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,930
Let's go

151
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:16,800
Look... you may think you know who
you're up against, but you don't

152
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,600
Then tell me

153
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,820
What really happened between you two

154
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,760
Peter Pan destroyed my father

155
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,620
They were right.You're here

156
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,110
Hey,laddie

157
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,870
My dogs were barking after hitting the
cobblestones all morning looking for work

158
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,240
Then these fellas told me that
they never played "find the lady"

159
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,860
Rumple Come on Rumple

160
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,860
You said you were finding a job

161
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,450
No one in this town would hire me

162
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,880
Because no one trusts you

163
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:15,770
But you do

164
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,440
Don't you,son

165
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,680
I want to

166
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,360
What if there was someplace
we could start over

167
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,320
Somewhere where no one knew you

168
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,310
How

169
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,230
With this

170
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,440
Where'd you get that

171
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,640
Do you know how much money
a bean like that would fetch

172
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,980
No,it's mine.I won't
let you gamble it away

173
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,900
Rumple,you don't understand

174
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,180
I understand this bean can take us
someplace... where no one knows us

175
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,830
Where we can be a family

176
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,310
- A real fresh start
- Yes

177
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,250
I trust you

178
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,480
Then where should we go

179
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,920
There must be someplace special to you

180
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,050
Think,think

181
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,040
Think,think,think,think,think

182
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,240
Think lovely thoughts

183
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,280
- That's it.
- What

184
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,820
When I was a boy, my father
sold me to a blacksmith

185
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,110
All day in front of hot
coals,the sweat and the grime

186
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,480
But every night I would say to
myself, "think lovely thoughts"

187
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,950
And in my sleep,I would travel
to the most wonderful place

188
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:48,870
- What was it called?
- Neverland

189
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,440
Then that's where we should go

190
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,590
I don't even know if this place is real

191
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,470
We need to talk

192
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,230
I've found when a woman says that,
I'm rarely in for pleasant conversation

193
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,740
There has to be a way for
David to leave the island

194
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,900
Well,there isn't

195
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,510
He told me about your
brother,what happened

196
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,740
I know it can't be easy to talk
about,but... Well,then let's not,shall we

197
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,050
The water that cured David from
dreamshade has connected him to the island

198
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,280
If he leaves,the connection is broken

199
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,170
The poison will kill him

200
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,430
What if we take some
of the water with us

201
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,610
That way he stays connected

202
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,070
He can stay alive in Storybrooke

203
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,900
For how long

204
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,370
Once the water runs out, the
dreamshade will take his life

205
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,100
Unless there was another cure

206
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,250
You suddenly interested
in what I have to say

207
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,260
Thought I wasn't to be trusted

208
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,880
You're not,but I'll take my chances

209
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:16,540
Well,if you remember, I,too,was poisoned
with dreamshade by a cowardly pirate

210
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,760
And yet... Yes,and we know
how you cured yourself...

211
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,820
with a candle that takes
another person's life

212
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,070
David is not that selfish

213
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,220
Oh,how noble

214
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:30,420
The point is,after my near-death experience,
I discovered much about the poison

215
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,680
I believe I could create
an elixir back in my shop

216
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,220
what is your price?

217
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,760
Well,this is quite the favor

218
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:44,760
- I'd expect one of equal weight in return.
- No

219
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,340
When we get back to Storybrooke,
you're gonna save David

220
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,630
because it's the right thing to do

221
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,150
No deals,no favors,understand

222
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,730
Fine

223
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,610
I'll do as you ask

224
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,660
I'll go tell David

225
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,040
We're here

226
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,530
Pan's perimeter

227
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,890
It's time

228
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,750
Tink will sneak us in
the back like we planned

229
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,660
We grab Henry.In and out,simple

230
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,700
You good with Pan patrol

231
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,180
Locked and loaded

232
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,710
You mind if I, borrow this

233
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,830
You said no magic,I agreed

234
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,530
But I'm not walking in there
with nothing but my good looks

235
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,920
Now I,on the other hand... Here,in
case your good looks fail you

236
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,560
Thanks,mate

237
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,970
Let's get Henry

238
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,860
Can I at least use magic on these boys

239
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,620
- No.
- I'll do it

240
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,450
You remember the spell

241
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,040
- Where's Pan?
- I don't know

242
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,530
- Henry - He's gotta
be somewhere - Where

243
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,790
Help

244
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,480
You're an... an adult

245
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,660
My name's Emma.I'm looking for my son

246
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,040
- Wendy
- Do I know you.It's Baelfire

247
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,090
- You two know each other
- Bae. - Yeah Yeah,we do

248
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,310
Can it really be you

249
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,760
I thought I'd never see you again

250
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,930
What are you... wh...
what are you doing here

251
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,210
Well,I... I came back to save you

252
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,560
You did that for me

253
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,950
Well,I couldn't bear for
you to be without a family,

254
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,950
not after you told us that your
mother and father were both dead

255
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,500
You told her I was dead

256
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,130
It was easier than telling the
truth... my own father abandoned me

257
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,800
We actually did it.We made it

258
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,060
It's just as I remember in my dreams

259
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,520
Hasn't changed at all

260
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,080
It's beautiful

261
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,130
No,it's more than that

262
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,650
Neverland is special

263
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,860
You can do anything here

264
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,940
Just think it,and it can happen

265
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,970
What would you like to eat

266
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,230
Go on.Just think it

267
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,880
You can eat cake all day
and not get a stomachache

268
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,750
Or swing on a vine through a waterfall

269
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,980
But best of all... you can fly

270
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,730
Flying is impossible

271
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,390
Neverland is where the impossible
is possible, if you believe it

272
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,560
Here,I'll show you

273
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:35,900
I don't understand

274
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,400
I could always fly
when I visited as a boy

275
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,220
Maybe you can't fly because
you're not a boy anymore

276
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,510
How could I have forgotten

277
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,980
Of course

278
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,200
Pixie dust

279
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,890
Even as a boy,you needed
pixie dust if you wanted to fly

280
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:04,600
- Where do we get some?
- Oh,I'll show you

281
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,400
Hey,Wendy, since you've been
here,have you seen my son

282
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,210
His name's Henry

283
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,410
- You have a son
- Yeah

284
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,740
Pan needs his heart

285
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,650
Has he said anything about the
heart of the truest believer

286
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,880
No I'm sorry

287
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,600
He never mentioned
anything about a heart

288
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:43,600
She's lying

289
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,150
Where is he

290
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,970
What the hell are you doing

291
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,760
I've carried enough lies in my
life to recognize their burden

292
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,410
She knows where Henry is

293
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,220
Is that true

294
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,300
You don't understand

295
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:01,820
You're helping Pan

296
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,570
He's keeping John and Michael
alive, only if I do as he says

297
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,900
Trust me, whatever he's
promised,he will go back on his word

298
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,610
And why should I trust a
man who abandoned his own son

299
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,100
Because your brothers did

300
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,130
They trusted a woman named Belle

301
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,730
They helped her get this
box so we can defeat Pan

302
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,070
They're okay

303
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,830
For now, and only if we succeed

304
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,420
Wendy... we will save John
and Michael,I swear to God

305
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,400
But right now,I really
need your help.Please

306
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,680
Pan told Henry that... he
needs his heart to save magic

307
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,420
But it's a lie

308
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,870
He needs it to save himself

309
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,230
What do you mean

310
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,690
Pan's dying

311
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:01,330
He needs the heart of the truest believer
to absorb all the magic in Neverland

312
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:07,040
And once he does... he will
be immortal,all powerful

313
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,780
And what happens to Henry

314
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,360
Well,it's a trade

315
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:18,380
When Pan lives, Henry will die

316
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,310
Ah,it's been a long time since
I stepped foot on this shore

317
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,260
What's that

318
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,610
It's a protection spell

319
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,810
Now let's go.It's time

320
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,200
How do we stop Pan

321
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,090
Pan took Henry to Skull Rock

322
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,710
But you haven't got much time

323
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,980
Then we stay behind

324
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,960
Someone needs to be here to guard
the lost boys when they wake up

325
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,800
- You don't need to stay behind
- David's right

326
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,910
You get him home,tell him we love him

327
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,420
Tell him yourself, when you
get back from Deadman's Peak

328
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,360
Gold can cure you back in Storybrooke

329
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,700
We just need to bring
some of the water with us

330
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:59,450
And you... you didn't give up.Thank you

331
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,070
Well,apparently,that's the
only thanks I need these days

332
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,070
Tink and I will take care of things here

333
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,410
Meet you back at the "Jolly
Roger" when you find Henry

334
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,510
Promise me if your father and I
don't make it back,you get him home

335
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,760
We're all going back home.Together

336
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,820
I'm tired

337
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,910
We're almost there

338
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,610
We can rest all we want
after we get the pixie dust,

339
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,160
do whatever your heart desires

340
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,450
Just wait.You'll see

341
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,000
What does it look like

342
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,540
It's just like dust

343
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,920
You never know the power it
contains just by looking at it

344
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,570
But when you believe in its power,

345
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,550
it glows with magic and becomes
something very special indeed

346
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,390
We're here

347
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,430
All I see are trees

348
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,220
That's because it's made in the flowers
that grow on the highest of the branches

349
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,220
Where they're closest to the stars

350
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,730
The flowers bloom at
night,soak in the starlight

351
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,000
That's how the pixie dust gets its magic

352
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,300
I haven't felt this excited in years,

353
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,590
since I was a boy about to climb
one of those trees in my dreams

354
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,920
Come on,Rumple

355
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,580
It'll be fun

356
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,590
Hey... you wanna fly,you
can't be afraid of heights

357
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,340
But I don't want to fly.You do

358
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,050
But you will,son, once
you see how it feels

359
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,750
The wind whipping in your
hair,the world below you

360
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,770
Like you've not got a care in the world

361
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,230
You're all alone.You're free

362
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,840
Come on,I'll give you a boost

363
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,920
But what if I fall

364
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,920
I promise you won't,hey

365
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,610
Don't make me,papa Please.I'm scared

366
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,940
I'm sorry,Rumple

367
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,560
I just get excited

368
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,060
Why don't you wait here,and I'll go get
the pixie dust for the both of us,hmm

369
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,430
- You promise not to be long
- Aye

370
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,490
I'll be as quick as a whip

371
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,790
Back before you know it

372
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,040
And then you'll see how
wonderful Neverland can really be

373
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,030
I want to fly

374
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,640
Hello

375
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,560
Is someone there

376
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,990
Who are you

377
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,860
I am the sole inhabitant of Neverland

378
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,310
Then can you tell me what's wrong

379
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,480
Why can't I fly

380
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,970
You have to believe

381
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,900
I'm trying,but it doesn't work

382
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,750
Because you don't belong

383
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:03,920
Papa.Papa.Papa

384
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,520
These are Henry's shoes

385
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,470
Wendy was right

386
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:29,980
They're here

387
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,000
Are you okay

388
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,370
I think so

389
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,290
What was that

390
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,020
Pan cast a protection spell

391
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,800
There has to be a way to break it

392
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,600
Careful with that

393
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,160
Try all you want,but
Pan's magic is too powerful

394
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,250
At least for you

395
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,050
Wha... How did you do that

396
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,370
The spell is designed to keep anyone
who casts a shadow from entering

397
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,550
And you don't have one

398
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,290
You were telling the truth
about ripping your shadow off

399
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,700
And Pan knows it

400
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,500
That's why he cast the spell he did

401
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,820
This isn't about keeping you out

402
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,200
It's about drawing me in

403
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,510
He knows I won't give up the chance
to finish what I came here to do

404
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,440
You really did come here to save Henry

405
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,780
I gave you my trust with that box

406
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,770
Now I need you to give it back

407
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,260
You better come through,Gold

408
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,340
Or I'll make whatever Pan has
planned for you look like child's play

409
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,020
You understand me

410
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:45,030
Well,a simple "good
luck" would've sufficed

411
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,090
So what are we supposed to do now

412
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,900
What about the spell my father
used to rip off his shadow

413
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,000
You think if I knew how to do that,
I wouldn't have done it already

414
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,580
- The moon
- The moon

415
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,850
The moon is what
causes our shadows,right

416
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,790
What if there was a way
to block it out using magic

417
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,060
What,you mean like an eclipse

418
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,030
Is that even possible

419
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,950
- Maybe
- So

420
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,490
- I need help
- With magic

421
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,400
It requires a lot

422
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,260
I guess we're about to find out how
much those lessons I gave you paid off

423
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,660
Follow my lead

424
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,800
This is it

425
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,470
The place where you're
going to save magic

426
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,130
Why does it have to be here

427
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:14,950
Well,because this is the location
from which Neverland's magic emanates

428
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,810
What's the hourglass for

429
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,680
Marks how much time we have left
before Neverland's magic runs out

430
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,110
It's almost empty

431
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,630
- Is something wrong?
- No.Come with me

432
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,460
There's something I need to take
care of before we get started,okay

433
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:09,750
What's wrong

434
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,160
- Rumple
- Papa

435
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,000
I thought something
terrible had happened to you

436
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,170
No.No,I'm fine,son

437
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,950
You don't have to worry about me

438
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:29,930
Did you get pixie dust

439
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:32,940
Yes

440
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,040
But when I tried using it,it didn't work

441
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,420
Why not

442
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,870
I'm not a boy anymore

443
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,460
You were right

444
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,610
Neverland is just for children

445
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,810
Adults don't belong here

446
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,040
Then... we'll leave
and go somewhere else

447
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:55,830
All that matters...
is that we're together

448
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,770
I wish it was that easy

449
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:04,490
But we both know wherever we
go, I'll go back to my old ways

450
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,960
I can never be the
father you need me to be

451
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,640
- I'm too weak 
- I don't understand

452
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,230
What are you trying to say

453
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,320
That there is a way
that I can stay here,

454
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,320
a way that I can get the pixie
dust to work so I can fly again...

455
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,800
just like I was when I was a boy

456
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,240
How

457
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:35,580
By letting go of the thing
that is holding me back... you

458
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,760
Help!A monster

459
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,860
It's not a monster,Rumple.It's a friend

460
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,140
It's part of the island

461
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:49,520
And after I do what it told me... I let
you go... it will become part of me,too

462
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,850
Don't let him take me

463
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,570
I don't have a choice

464
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,840
To stay here,I have to
believe that I'm young again

465
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,250
And with you here to remind me,I can't

466
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,960
No,papa,please.Help me

467
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,860
A child can't have a child,Rumple

468
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,280
I'm sorry but it's true

469
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,430
Don't fight it

470
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,280
We both know that you're
better off without me

471
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:16,180
I was never meant to be a father.No

472
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:49,990
Hello,laddie

473
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,860
Oh,I see you've come bearing gifts

474
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,490
Where's Henry

475
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,920
Oh,you mean my great-grandson

476
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,840
You still haven't told
the others who I really am

477
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,750
Not even your own son

478
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,000
Why

479
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,530
Because you're nothing
but a coward to me

480
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,870
We both know if that were
true, I'd already be in that box

481
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,150
You don't think I can do it

482
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,840
- You let me inside just to,uh,taunt me.
- No

483
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,410
To see you again, to
give you one last chance

484
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,570
Stay with me

485
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,690
Let this go

486
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,550
Let's start over

487
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,880
Do you think I want to be with you

488
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,540
That I could ever forgive
you after you abandoned me

489
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,120
I'm disappointed,Rumple

490
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,120
After all these years,I
thought you'd be more...

491
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:53,970
understanding, considering you
did the same thing to your son

492
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:59,720
You traded Baelfire for the power of
a dagger, and I traded you for youth

493
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,990
We're a lot more alike
than you care to admit

494
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:06,010
- We are nothing alike
- Oh,of course we are

495
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,780
And it's nothing to be ashamed of

496
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,530
Neither one of us was cut
out to be a father,m'boy

497
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,910
I regretted leaving my
son the moment I let him go

498
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:19,190
I spent my life trying to
find him, to get him back

499
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,560
And what did you do

500
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,570
You forgot about me

501
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,900
I never forgot about you

502
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,440
Why do you think I
call myself "Peter Pan"

503
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,410
Don't think for a moment I believe
it's because you care for me

504
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,350
But I do

505
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:41,920
All you have to do is put down
that box, and you'll see it's true

506
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,370
We can make the fresh start you always
wanted, together, just as we planned

507
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,660
Oh,I'm gonna make a fresh start

508
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,280
Just not with you

509
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,470
I don't understand

510
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,790
'Cause you don't have it

511
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,730
- You switched them 
- Follow the lady

512
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,740
Still having trouble believing

513
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,410
In Neverland,all you have to do
is think of something to have it

514
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,550
Even something fake

515
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:36,590
But the real one...
Well,let's see what it can do

516
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,040
No.I'm sorry,Rumple

517
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,190
You had your chance

518
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,870
The choice was yours

519
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:18,900
Come on

520
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,250
What happened to the bean

521
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:26,550
He used it

522
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,990
He left me and he's never coming back

523
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,450
Oh,it's for the best,Rumple

524
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,070
I'm alone now

525
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,450
No,you have us...
- And a wheel

526
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,720
- You always have a home here

527
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,370
Now get some rest...
And you'll feel better

528
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,050
Later we'll spin,hmm

529
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,300
Where's your doll

530
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:45,740
I lost him

531
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,830
Well,we'll make you another one

532
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,620
You can give it the same name

533
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:54,770
No.Peter Pan is gone forever

534
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,360
What is this place

535
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,050
I don't remember
seeing it from my dreams

536
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,660
That's because it didn't exist

537
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,800
It was created when you made
the decision to stay here

538
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,080
A giant skull

539
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,820
It's glorious

540
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,570
What's the hourglass for

541
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,360
It represents the magic
fueling your youth,

542
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,140
the magic allowing you to
stay here, to stay young

543
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,300
And what happens when it runs out

544
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:56,850
Your youth will be
taken and you will die

545
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,620
But I thought I was going
to stay young forever

546
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,780
Neverland is a place for
children to visit in their dreams,

547
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,740
not a place for them to live

548
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,940
You are the first to try to stay

549
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,390
And in doing so,you're
breaking the rules

550
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,390
Any rule can be broken,especially here

551
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,570
I made this place without
even thinking about it

552
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,090
- There has to be a way.
- Perhaps

553
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,300
Then I will find it

554
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,270
I will find a way

555
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,700
I believe

556
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,780
It's time,Henry

557
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,560
Time to save magic, to save Neverland

558
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,490
What do I have to do

559
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:49,970
You must give me your heart,Henry...
the heart of the truest believer

560
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,010
You mean... I have to believe

561
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,660
No,Henry

562
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,740
I mean,you need to give me your heart

563
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,300
But... what will happen to me

564
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,900
You'll become the greatest of all heroes

565
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,750
You can tell me the truth

566
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,210
I know all magic comes with a price

567
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,480
Saving it must come with a price,too

568
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,340
I would never lie to you,Henry

569
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,110
I mean,you're right

570
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,310
There is a price

571
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,060
You have to stay here
on the island with me

572
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,000
Neverland will become your new home

573
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,750
I know it's a huge
sacrifice,but isn't it worth it

574
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,290
Heroes have to make
sacrifices all the time

575
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,430
My family taught me that

576
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,280
Then they'd be proud if they could see you
now, because you're about to save them all

577
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,600
- Now are you ready?
- Yes

578
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:53,810
Then let me help you

579
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,370
Henry,wait

580
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,960
Whatever Pan's telling
you to do,don't do it

581
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,820
- Dad.You're alive?
- I am,buddy

582
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,550
And I need you to listen to me

583
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,430
Pan is lying to you

584
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:28,310
Oh,pleasure to see you,too,Baelfire, not
to mention the Savior and the Evil Queen

585
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,790
Henry, you need to get away from him now

586
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,540
- He's trying to hurt you
- No

587
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,250
The heart of the truest believer

588
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,280
It's what's gonna save magic

589
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,230
It's gonna save all of you

590
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,520
No,it's not

591
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,180
This was never about magic,Henry

592
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,260
You have to believe us

593
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,980
The only person Pan's
interested in saving is himself

594
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,980
That's not true

595
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,290
Of course it isn't

596
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,290
Yes,it is

597
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,950
Pan can't live without you dying

598
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,740
If you give him your
heart,it's gonna kill you

599
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,850
They're trying to stem your belief,Henry

600
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:00,850
But don't let them

601
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:05,000
Remember,every hero gets tested

602
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:15,330
Henry... I know what being a
hero looks like, and this isn't it

603
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,420
Why would they lie

604
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,820
Because that's what adults do,Henry

605
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,710
You know that better than anyone

606
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,300
Henry... you have to believe us

607
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,850
Your parents don't care
about Neverland,Henry

608
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:33,360
They know if you give your heart
to save it, then you'll have to stay

609
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,570
They're being selfish because
they don't wanna lose you

610
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,180
- Henry,you have to trust us
- Trust!

611
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,610
I'm the only one who's ever
been honest with you,Henry

612
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,250
The only one who ever believed in you

613
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,700
This is your choice.Not theirs

614
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,480
You have to choose now

615
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,380
We're running out of time

616
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,630
We believe in
you,Henry.Because we love you

617
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,080
More than anything

618
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:04,930
I love you,too

619
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,030
But I have to save magic

620
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,760
No,no,no,no.I'm sorry

621
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,160
No.

622
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,000
Henry
