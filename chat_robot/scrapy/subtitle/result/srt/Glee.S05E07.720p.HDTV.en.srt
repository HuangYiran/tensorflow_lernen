1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,040
So here's what you missed on Glee.Sue framed Figgins so she could take his job

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,570
- so now she's principal and Becky's her Beckretary.- Get out,bitch!

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,540
Kurt started a cover band  called Pamela Lansbury and Rachel's in it

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,480
and so is Santana and so is Dani and so is Elliot,

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,710
- who they also call Star Child but his name's really Elliot.- Oh,my God,Star Child.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,250
Jake used to be a man-slut but then he wasn't  because he met Marley

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,720
but then he cheated on Marley with Bree  which was so super mean

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,270
because Marley's so nice and Bree's so horrible and it's like,geez,

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,630
I guess he's a man-slut again.That's so sad.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,030
My Aunt Felicia always says,"A tiger can't change his stripes.

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,590
And that's what you missed on Glee.

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,630
Hey,um,guys!Guys... New Directions!New Directions!Guys!

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,460
Hey!I just ran into Mr.Shue,and he's gonna be stuck  in his classroom for the rest of the afternoon

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,020
because of some school board inspection thing,but he still wanted us to meet

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,850
- so we can start working on ideas for nationals.- Beyonc!

16
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,260
This is anarchy!We can't... we can't all just shout at the same time.

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,010
That's better.I have some ideas already.

18
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,920
I'm thinking  that the music needs to be really simple,so we can really highlight our voices.

19
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,130
No guitars,or nothing electronic.We go with a simple piano arrangement.Which I could play.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,290
- I'm assuming you're singing lead?- Well,I am a senior,and this is my last go at it.

21
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,130
We need to win this.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,430
- Well,feels like North Korea up in here.- Okay,forget the piano.Forget all the music.

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,100
We could just do,um,a cappella,that always works.

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,280
Warblers.Should we wear matching blazers,too?

25
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,980
Let's take it back... What was wrong with the guitars?

26
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,390
Nothing,why can't you guys just stop resisting me  for a second,and just go with me?

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,410
- Okay,Blaine Jong-il.- Yes!Blaine Jong-il

28
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,960
I am not trying to be bossy.I am trying to give the benefit of my experience.

29
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,030
I have won more show choir competitions than anyone in this room.

30
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,340
You suck.

31
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,980
- A capella is worth a shot.Let's do it.- Thank you.

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,570
- Then you two can have fun in your little barbershop couplet  while the rest of us discuss something good.- Fine.

33
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:04,360
You don't want my help...  ...then I am not gonna give it.

34
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,200
- Looks like somebody's man-struating.- I heard that.

35

38
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,420
Oh,good.We're all here.

39
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,880
Thank you,Team Pamela Lansbury,for assembling on such short notice.

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,270
Okay,well,I rescheduled my dialect session,so what's up with this emergency text?

41
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:31,250
- What's up is I just booked our band's debut gig!- Amazing.Where?When?

42
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,570
This Thursday,7:30 p.m.,at the Greenwich Village hot-spot Callbacks.

43
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,610
Ooh,NYADA's premier piano bar.

44
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,200
Hold on,isn't that a Broadway hangout?

45
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,850
Well,traditionally,but I talked to the manager,and he says that Thursdays are kind of their dead nights.

46
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,190
So we can go in and do whatever we want.

47
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,420
No way,we cannot debut there.That is instant career suicide.

48
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,680
Yeah,Kurt,look,not to overstep,

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,150
but I-I follow a lot of bands just starting out,and it's kind of all about the launch.

50
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,230
You know,getting music critics out to see you,and that's a lot easier with the right venue.

51
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,210
Oh,come on,Callbacks is a real funky place.You know,they've got tons of history.

52
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,270
Yeah,but I can't think  of a single band that started out there.

53
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,190
I mean,it's not like The Bitter End or the Mercury Lounge,or...

54
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,510
Yeah,and if people associate that place  with show tunes,nobody's gonna come out for...

55
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,630
Our covers of Madonna's greatest hits?I disagree,Dani.

56
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,890
- Oh,so we're back to the whole Madonna thing?- Yes,it was my first impulse.

57
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,780
Okay,look,guys,I know it's untraditional,but you have to trust me.

58
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:30,710
I was there at Callbacks.I saw it all,a vision of perfect clarity.Every seat was occupied.

59
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,110
A quiet hush fell over the expectant crowd.As Pamela Lansbury made their way to the stage,

60
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,980
and the opening notes of Madonna's 1985 single hit "Into the Groove" begin.

61
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,660
*And you can dance *

62
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,430
*For inspiration *

63
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,560
*Get into the groove,boy *

64
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,720
*You've got to prove your love to me *

65
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:02,130
*Yeah *Get up on your feet,yeah,step to the beat *

66
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:09,950
*Boy,what will it be *Music can be such a revelation *

67
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,110
*Dancing around you feel the sweet sensation *

68
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,260
*We might be lovers if the rhythm's right *

69
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,190
*I hope this feeling never ends tonight *

70
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,210
*Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free *

71
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,370
*At night I lock the doors where no one else can see *

72
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,520
*I'm tired of dancing here all by myself *

73
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,700
*Tonight I want to dance with someone else *

74
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,580
*Get into the groove,boy *You've got to prove your love to me *

75
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,300
*Yeah,get up on your feet *

76
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,130
*Yeah,step to the beat *

77
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:59,490
*Boy,what can it be,yeah *Live out your fantasy here with me *

78
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,730
*Just let the music set you free *

79
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:10,850
*Touch my body,move in time *  *Now I know you're mine *

80
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,450
*Now I know you're mine *

81
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:23,600
*Now I know you're mine *  Now I know you're mine *

82
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:30,270
*Now I know you're mine *You've got to get into the groove,boy *

83
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,760
*You've got to prove your love to me *

84
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:42,940
*Yeah,get up on your feet *Yeah,step to the beat *Boy,what will it be *

85
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,090
*You have to get into the groove *

86
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,830
*Boy,you got to prove your love to me *

87
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:59,260
*Get up on your feet *Yeah,step to the beat *Boy,what will it be *

88
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,060
*You've got to get into the groove.*

89
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,830
Oh,it's my fianc.Talk amongst yourselves.Hello?

90
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,430
Oh,can I just say Glee Club sucks!Mr.Shue asked for ideas for nationals.

91
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,970
And when I gave some genius ones,everyone got all mad and started dissing me.

92
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,930
Maybe I came on too strong.But since when is that a bad thing?

93
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,910
It's not,but you got to remember,at McKinley everyone has an equal vote.

94
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,240
And if you come on too aggressively,they might think you're a control-freak or a puppet master.

95
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,680
Anyway... I was gonna call you.Pamela Lansbury booked its first gig.

96
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,390
And I know you were just here,but I was hoping you could come cheer us on in the audience.

97
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,240
So,what do you say... can I send you the deets?And a JetBlue voucher?

98
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,500
Uh,of course,I wouldn't miss it.Wow,I can't believe anyone would see me as controlling.

99
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,350
- You missed a spot.- I'm doing the best I can,Sue.

100
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,380
You know,the way you clean these floors  is a perfect metaphor for the way you ran this school.

101
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,120
You did your best,but your best just wasn't good enough.

102
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,050
Look,I know you're upset  that the school board is coming today to evaluate McKinley,

103
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,440
and to determine if I'm worthy to be instated as full-time principal.

104
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,180
And do you realize in my short time as acting principal,test scores have risen 42%.

105
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,720
And my new caning policy has dropped both absences and tardiness down to zero.

106
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,160
So,the truth is you should be cleaning floors and I should be running schools.

107
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,760
And if you would like to continue cleaning floors  and feeding your family,

108
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,270
I suggest you do  everything you can to make sure this place looks just amazing  for this evaluation.

109
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,330
They're in your office,Coach.

110
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,900
One last question before we come back  for the official evaluation later in the week.

111
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,740
Why do you want to be a principal?

112
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,670
Now,I know everyone wants to wear the crown,but the fantasy of it  can be quite different from the reality.

113
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,550
Well,more than anyone I have ever met,I was born to be in charge.

114
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,010
Test scores are up.Kids are showing up.Our sports teams are winning.

115
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,130
Heck,even the Glee Club is back competing  for the national title of clubs no one really cares about.

116
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:10,240
And all of this is happening because I can finally manifest my vision  without having to clear it with some fool.

117
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:16,280
You give me this school,and in one year  it will be the top school in the state.I guarantee it.

118
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,610
I'm a champion,gentlemen.Let me be your champion.

119
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,090
We'll be back in a week.

120
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,750
But between you and me,barring a total catastrophe,you have my vote.

121
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,500
You certainly have a lot of trophies,Principal Sylvester.

122
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,620
Well,Superintendent Harris,you're new in town,you may not be aware,

123
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,500
but I am the only seven-time national champion cheerleading coach  in the country.

124
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,420
- Hmm,my wife used to watch those competitions on television.- Mm-hmm.

125
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,650
Bugged the crap out of me if I'm gonna be totally honest.

126
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,850
- We're divorced.Are you married?- No,no.I married myself once,but I don't think it was legal.

127
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,150
We should go out for a beer sometime.

128
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,620
Oh,are you sure that's appropriate,Bob?

129
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,550
I don't think anyone would see a couple of guys going out  for a beer as anything shady.

130
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,780
Besides I'm new in town.I'd like to find some great dudes to hang out with.

131
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,520
I-I'll call your office,okay?

132
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,830
I'm lactose intolerant,and I may have to fart,Coach.

133
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,980
I don't look masculine,do I,Becky?

134
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,240
- You have an allure that goes beyond gender.- That's what I always say.

135
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,890
I have to admit,while I find his hairline highly suspicious for a man his age,

136
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,640
that Bob Harris thinks I could star in the sequel to Boys Don't Cry,honestly,it kind of bums me out.

137
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,250
Maybe it's your clothes.You could try on a skirt every now and then.

138
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:48,790
No,you don't understand the era I grew up in.I became a teacher almost 30 years ago.It was 1986.

139
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,080
It was a different time.

140
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,510
I tried being girly.But I found it hard to get the respect I felt I deserved.

141
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,830
- Boys,no video games in school.- Who are you supposed to be?

142
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,430
- I'm the new cheerleading coach.- Do you bop?

143
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,630
Get to class,mates.

144
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,860
I've been trying to sound like Crocodile Dundee.Word of advice new Cheerios!Coach,Sue Sylvester.

145
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,840
Try some pants.

146
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,350
Get to class!

147
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,190
That new cheerleading coach is one scary dude.

148
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:13,940
The moment I put that track suit on,the world bowed before me.I had one made in every color.

149
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:20,210
Maybe it's time for a change,Coach.Everybody is scared of you now.It can't hurt to girl it up a bit.

150
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,750
- You're early.- Geez!Oh,Brad!You scared the crap out of me!Warn me before you talk!

151
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,580
I'm sorry,man.I'm having a bad week.

152
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:42,580
Tell me about it.I can't stop playing online blackjack.I owe thousands of dollars to some very sketchy people.

153
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,680
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?I'm in 23 clubs!

154
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,620
I probably would've been prom king if this school didn't have so many stoners.

155
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,880
And what's wrong with having a solid game plan?

156
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:57,000
- My house is getting foreclosed on.- And get this,my fianc called me a Puppet Master!

157
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:01,780
Well,if "pulling strings"  means that I encourage people to reach their fullest potential,

158
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,540
then,hell yeah,guilty as charged!

159
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:12,930
Brad,if everyone just wants me to sit down and shut up...  that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

160
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,910
I'm gonna be right back here in the back corner.

161
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:26,260
- Believe me,that'll send a message...  - Blainey Days!

162
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:31,430
- Blainey Days,wake up!We're sorry we didn't listen to you earlier.- Yeah,dawg.Our bad,yo!

163
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,730
I'd love to say something really bitchy or even downright cruel,

164
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,930
but I can't,because you're clearly the most talented teenager at this school!

165
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,190
On this planet!

166
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,860
Yeah,that's why we're best friends,even though  I'm straight and you're gay and I'm blond and you're gay.

167
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,870
- May the Force be with you.- Kids,I've got an awesome idea!

168
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,060
This week's lesson is all about the most inspiring guy we know: Blaine!

169
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,150
Ooh,child,Unique's got the blues!

170
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,660
And the only way to cure 'em  is to hear Blaine's smooth-as-a-baby's-butt voice!

171
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,740
- Please,Blaine!- Please?

172
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,090
Please?

173
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,590
- Yeah,Blaine!- Really?

174
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,860
Well,if you guys insist.What should I sing?Oh,I know.Hit it!

175
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:23,660
*Ooh,you make me live *Whatever this world can give to me *

176
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:31,620
*It's you,you're all I see *  Ooh,you make me live now,honey *

177
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,540
*Ooh,you make me live *

178
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:41,020
*Oh,you're the best friend that I ever had *

179
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,340
*I've been with you such a long time *

180
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,380
*You're my sunshine,and I want you to know *

181
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:57,340
*That my feelings are true *I really love you  *Oh,you're my best friend.*

182
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,810
*Ooh,you make me live!*

183
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:08,880
*Ooh,I've been wandering around back to you *He'll come back to you *

184
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,310
*Rain or shine,you stood by me,girl *

185
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,910
*And I'm happy at home *  *You're my best friend *

186
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:27,150
*Ooh,you make me live *Whenever this world is cruel to me *

187
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,520
*I've got you to help me forgive *  *Ooh-ooh *

188
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,410
*Ooh,you make me live now,honey *

189
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,800
*And I'm happy *  *You're my best friend *

190
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:52,230
*Oh **Oh,you're my best friend *

191
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,020
*Ooh,you make me live,ooh-ooh *

192
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:03,170
*Ooh,you're my best friend *Oh-oh *Oh-oh!*

193
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,030
*Oh-oh!You make me live!*

194
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,060
Blainey Days,Blainey Days,what's wrong with you?

195
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah,dude,you didn't say a word the entire class.Didn't even sing.

196
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,330
You want us to call you a waaambulance?'Cause your pity party is out of control.

197
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,440
Yeah,girl,check yourself before you wreck yourself!

198
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:33,520
And again.Five,six,seven,eight.Go one,two... four.Six,eight.

199
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,610
Sharper.Two,three,here it comes.Make sure we land.

200
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,110
Oh,God,okay,I've seen enough.Everyone stop.

201
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,750
Look,I'm gonna do you guys a favor.

202
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,480
You suck,and I can't be bothered to keep wasting my time.

203
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:49,660
Hit the showers and get focused.Please,tomorrow,we are doing 540s.

204
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,210
- Oh,my God,her,too?- All of them,actually.

205
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,820
Jake,hey,uh,listen,I just wanted to say thanks  for sticking up for me in Glee Club.

206
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,210
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one  that cares about pushing us so we can nail it,you know?

207
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah,I know,I mean,I'm getting pretty sick of it,too.

208
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:20,260
Um,I don't know how else to say this,but...  there's something's going on in the choir room.

209
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,090
I don't know if it's haunted or like a space-time rift happening,

210
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:29,710
but trust me,do yourself a favor,sit in the back corner.

211
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,800
It's crazy.

212
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,770
Dance has never been our strong suit,but I think with Jake's help,we can really kick it up a notch.

213
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,980
- Jake?- What's the point?

214
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,740
I'm sorry?

215
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,130
Seriously,what is the point?I could choreograph a sick dance,none of you can keep up.

216
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,550
I mean,half of you can't even do it and won't even try.Why?

217
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,010
Because you're not dancers.So let's not waste my time.

218
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,810
Let's just do another cut-and-paste dance routine that even Tina can pick up.

219
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,860
- You are such a conceited jerk.- I'm not conceited,I'm bored.

220
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,870
- Please,we've seen your dance moves.They're fine,not epic.- Oh,you want to see epic?

221
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,750
Give me a beat!

222
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:25,260
*Sittin' in the movie show thinking nasty thoughts *

223
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:35,510
*Better be a gentleman or you'll turn me off,uh,huh *

224
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,350
*That's right,and let me tell it *

225
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,000
*Nasty,nasty boys don't mean a thing,uh,huh *

226
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:52,560
*Oh,you nasty boys *Nasty,nasty boys,don't ever change,huh *

227
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,910
*Oh,you nasty boys *I don't like no nasty girl *

228
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,460
*I don't like nasty food,uh,huh *

229
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,650
*Ooh,yeah *

230
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:10,490
*The only nasty thing I like is a nasty groove,uh!*

231
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,470
*Will this one do?*

232
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:18,280
*Uh-huh,I know,sing *I'm not a prude,I just want some respect *

233
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,690
*That's right *So close the door if you want me to respond,ooh,yeah *

234
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,340
*'Cause privacy is my middle name *

235
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,650
*My last name is control *No,my first name ain't "baby" *

236
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,190
*It's Janet... Ms.Jackson if you're nasty *

237
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,600
*People of the world today *Are we looking for a better way of life?*

238
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:49,070
*Say!We are a part of the rhythm nation *

239
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,710
*Rhythm!*  *People of the world unite *

240
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,940
*Strength in numbers,we can get it right,one time *

241
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,720
*Sing on *We are a part of the rhythm nation *

242
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:02,230
*Everybody!*Nasty,nasty boys *  *Don't mean a thing *

243
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,000
*We are a part of the rhythm nation *Everybody sing it *

244
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,850
*Nasty,nasty boys don't ever change *

245
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,190
*We are a part of the rhythm nation *

246
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:24,400
*Rhythm... *We are a part of the rhythm nation *Sing it *

247
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,010
*It goes to hear the rhythm *

248
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,840
*We are a part of the rhythm nation *  *Oh,you nasty boys.*

249
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,340
Baby-faced mocha-teen boy,arise!

250
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,430
Where is everyone?

251
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,460
They left minutes ago,muttering hateful comments  about your snide,

252
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,690
nasty mouth and bad boy attitudes.Now clear out!

253
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,910
Excuse me,Miss Alfano.

254
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,820
As much as I've really enjoyed learning about yarn these past three months,I was wondering,

255
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,280
since Arts and Crafts is my senior elective,if maybe I could do my own thing

256
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,070
and venture into felt  and fabric and even yarn and make a puppet?

257
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,590
Your request surely begs the question,Why on earth would an 18-year-old man want to make a puppet?

258
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,900
Well... it's not just any puppet... It's a puppet of my fianc.

259
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,520
We're 600 miles apart,and even though I get to see him tomorrow night,

260
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,130
I'd really like to see him right now,even though it might be only in my imagination.

261
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,920
Fine.Make a puppet.

262
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,570
- May I experiment with coupage?- No.

263
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,450
I forgave myself a long time ago.I think it's time I forgive you now.

264
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,280
You are right.Please forgive me.

265
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,280
In this argument,I don't have a leg to stand on.

266
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,010
Hey,Principal... uh,Coach.Um,geez,are you okay?

267
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:04,130
Oh,what's with the shoes?Man,you have big feet.

268
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,820
Well,I'm sorry if my femininity threatens you.

269
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,350
What is that?Did you just touch me with a puppet?

270
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,740
Oh,I made it in Crafts class.

271
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,290
- Get that thing out of here!I don't ever want to see that thing  in my hallway again!- What?

272
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,310
You can't just ban puppets.

273
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,440
Are you saying that because of the shoes?Are you less afraid of me?

274
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,650
In a few days' time I am going to be evaluated  on my abilities to run this school.

275
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,240
If the school board comes here and sees schizophrenic students clearly off their meds talking to puppets,

276
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,410
they are gonna think I don't have a handle on things.

277
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,840
- Well... Hey,hey!Kurt puppet!- This is contraband.

278
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:40,670
And if I catch you with your hand  up the butt of anything that isn't human,you're in a world of trouble.

279
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,980
But... Be careful.

280
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,670
Damn it!

281
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,460
Sue,I... look,I-I'm trying to work.

282
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,960
Do you mind coming back in,like,an hour to barge in here  without knocking

283
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,500
and start insulting me for no reason?

284
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,790
Oh,sure,sure,pal.I just,uh,I want to ask you a question first.

285
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,120
Um... you're an oddly feminine man.

286
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,130
- What?- Oh,please,you just literally did a pirouette.

287
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,710
Sue,just because a guy can dance doesn't make him effeminate.

288
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,820
That's what I'm saying.When you dance,somehow  you're able to maintain your manliness.

289
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,970
Here's the thing:  Um... I happen to have a sizeable crush

290
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,140
on the handsomest man in the universe,Superintendent Bob Harris.

291
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,330
I've had multiple conversations with him.

292
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,500
In fact,several days ago,I was quite certain he was flirting with me.

293
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,990
But it turns out all this time he thought I was a man.

294
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,890
I blame the Johnny Cash song,"A Boy Named Sue.

295
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,330
- You know what they used to say about Ginger Rogers?- No.

296
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,230
That she could lead her partner while dancing backwards in high heels.

297
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,300
I have no idea how that is germane to this conversation.

298
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,490
Ginger Rogers was the pinnacle of femininity.

299
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,090
I mean,she was one of the most famous dancers in the world,and her partner was Fred Astaire,

300
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,460
maybe the greatest dancer of all time.

301
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,900
Again,I don't know how this pertains to what I'm talking about.

302
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,600
The point is,Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did...

303
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,150
only she did it backwards and in high heels.

304
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,320
I mean,she managed to find a way to be feminine and strong.

305
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,680
Half the time when it looked like Fred Astaire was leading her?

306
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,300
- She was leading him.- Okay.

307
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:33,140
Tell you what.Let's make a dealI'll teach you to lead while dancing backwards in high heels,.

308
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,080
and you give me the $600 I need for new costumes at nationals.

309
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,270
Nope.Forget it.

310
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,340
I'm sorry,there's no way in hell I'm going to give  the Glee Club more money for costumes

311
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:47,130
until you can explain to me how you paid for  that 18-cubic-foot inflatable Lady Gaga airbag

312
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,650
that you strapped onto the back  of the crippled kid's wheelchair.

313
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,850
- That was at least $1,000 right there,William.- Fine.Suit yourself.

314
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,460
Hey,doll.What do you say you and I cut a rug?

315
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:21,240
*Heaven *I'm in heaven *And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak *

316
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:29,940
*And I seem to find *The happiness I seek *When we're out together *

317
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,880
*Dancing cheek to cheek *

318
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:46,080
*Heaven *I'm in heaven *And the cares that hung around me through the week *

319
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,240
*Seem to vanish *Like a gambler's lucky streak *

320
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:57,760
*When we're out together *  *Dancing cheek to cheek *

321
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,780
*Oh,I love to climb a mountain *

322
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,610
*And to reach the highest peak *

323
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,420
*But it doesn't thrill me half as much *

324
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,110
*As dancing cheek to cheek *

325
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,510
*Oh,I love to go out fishing *  *Go out fishing*

326
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,490
*In a river or a creek *  *Or a creek*

327
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,590
*But I don't enjoy it half as much *

328
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,950
*As dancing cheek to cheek *

329
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:07,470
*And I seem to find *The happiness I seek *When we're out together *

330
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:14,070
*Dancing cheek to cheek.*

331
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,480
Come on,Coach!Wake up!I've got to shop for a mini-fridge for college!

332
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,880
Oh,God,let it go.I don't want a girlfriend.

333
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,140
Shut up.I don't want to be your girlfriend,either.

334
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,090
Then what?I'm late for class.

335
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,060
I'm pregnant.With your baby.

336
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,730
- Bree,this is... - All I'm going to ask is that  you come with me to the doctor,okay?

337
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,640
- Wh-What are your parents going to say?- No... parents.

338
00:26:53,910 --> 00:27:01,360
This is staying between us.Forever.It's the right thing to do.Right?

339
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,380
Well,well,well.If it isn't Miss Sally Field in Not Without My Puppet.

340
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,450
Did you really think I was too stupid to suspect  that you would come back here

341
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:38,450
under the cloak of darkness  to claim your monstrous puppet-bride,you strange,tiny,doe-eyed pervert?

342
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,800
Kindly remove your fist from Puppet Hummel's butt  and place him gingerly on the desk.

343
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,850
And now report to detention for the rest of the week.

344
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,390
But I was supposed to fly to New York to see Kurt's first big show.

345
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,940
Well,then you're gonna have to cancel Wonder Woman's invisible jet,

346
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,710
or whatever magic discount  bullet train you kids use for your weekly jaunts to New York.

347
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,110
Now,get out of here.Go feel shame.

348
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,520
Hi.

349
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,980
Hey.Did you get your ticket that I reserved for you,house-left?

350
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,810
Kurt,I was gonna call you.Um,please don't be mad,but... I'm not in New York,I'm in Lima.

351
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,090
A-Are you kidding?What happened?Did you miss your flight?

352
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:28,750
- A-Are you okay?- I-I'm fine.I'm just,um...  I'm just trying to explain.

353
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,220
Yes,why don't you explain... and it better be a good explanation.

354
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,820
Well,Principal Sylvester gave me detention,and she said if I tried to skip it

355
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,150
that she was gonna suspend me  and put it on my permanent record.

356
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,360
Hang on.Whoa,whoa,wait one second.And you weren't going to call me?

357
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,850
I-I was trying my best not to hurt you.

358
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,180
All I did was steal back the Kurt puppet that I made in crafts class.

359
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,990
Excuse me?The-the what puppet?What the hell are you talking about?

360
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:54,580
Uh,I-I know,it's,uh,it's kind of... a weird story.But basically,I was missing you.

361
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,780
And is that how you see me?

362
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,480
As a thing of felt and cloth and button eyes that has no feelings,

363
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,410
that you can play with and manipulate and then discard whenever you're bored?

364
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,950
- Oh,no. - I'm a person,Blaine.

365
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,560
I am flesh and blood and bone,and this is a really big night for me,and I needed you to be here.

366
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,810
Kurt...

367
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,720
- Hey.- We can release Blaine's seat.

368
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,560
I don't think that's gonna be necessary.

369
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,740
One person?

370
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,060
- And he thinks Angela Lansbury's performing.- I told you so.

371
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,020
Let's be real for a second.

372
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:47,200
I've never been all that nice to you,and I don't  really get whatever's... going on with you,

373
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,110
but I have to say,there's a part of me that really admires it.

374
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:56,750
When a woman of my stature needs a makeover,she rings up all her best gays,

375
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,980
but unfortunately,Porcelain,the Sassy Toothless Elf,is in New York.

376
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,110
So... God's most fabulous mistake,I turn to you.

377
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,870
I want to look more like a lady.

378
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,250
Girl,I have already pulled out my makeup kit... I got you,boo.

379
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,590
Welcome,teen delinquents,to detention,AKA "The Beck-fast Club,"

380
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:25,170
named after Miss Becky Jackson,who has been here more than any other student.

381
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,870
- Yeah,why is that?- 'Cause I like saying bad words,bitch!

382
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:34,170
Jacob X.Puckerman,you were caught red-handed starting another  exciting

383
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,720
yet forbidden fistfight in the William McKinley High School hallways.

384
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,030
Why are you such a mysterious musical bad boy?

385
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:48,040
It is now 4:01.You have exactly eight hours to ponder the horrific  error of your pubescent ways.

386
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:53,810
- There will be no talking and no monkeyshines,is that clear?- Crystal.

387
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,300
You know,maybe we could use this time  to get to know each other a little better.

388
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,780
We could sit in a circle on the floor and tell each other  about our core wounds.

389
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:12,330
Or you shut your hole.I'm going to college soon,I don't have time for your lame-ass bull crap.

390
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:24,390
I'm sorry,Blaine Warbler.But that was totally inappropriate.Please come sit with me.

391
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:30,440
Sometimes I fly off the handle.Like yesterday,when I taped Dottie's buns together.

392
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,040
I did it for my old man.I wanted him to think I was cool.

393
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:38,190
That's really heavy,Becky.Thanks for sharing.What's going on with you,Blaine?

394
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:45,070
Well,to tell the truth,guys,I feel really,really guilty about  missing Kurt's show in New York.

395
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,840
Why?It's a stupid cover band.

396
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,960
- And,dude,you go to New York all the time... you were just there last week.- True.But Kurt needs me.

397
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:59,050
- We all need you,because you are so awesome.- Yeah,you're America's gay sweetheart.

398
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,800
Thanks,guys.You guys are,like,my only real friends.

399
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,270
- But we're not real; we're puppets.- Maybe that's a bad thing.

400
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,500
Maybe the fact that I can only really feel like myself  with friends

401
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:14,620
I can totally control is keeping me  from really feeling like I'm close to anyone.

402
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:18,370
Maybe it's indicative of a deeper intimacy issue.

403
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,820
Or maybe everyone should just wise up  and start doing everything you see,

404
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,410
because you are so right on all the time.

405
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,940
By the way,did you notice you're  now having puppet fantasies outside the choir room?

406
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,460
That's not normal.Seriously,you might want to get a CAT scan.

407
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,210
Hello,hello.Wake up.Hey.

408
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,440
Will you cover for me,please?I've got to leave early.

409
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:40,710
- Uh,y-yeah,sure.Why?- It's not important.Later.

410
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,360
Hey,so,are you ready to go?

411
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,560
No need.The crimson tide is rolling again.

412
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:57,300
I got my period.I'm not pregnant.I guess I was just late... this month.

413
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,670
Are you serious?That's awesome news.Oh,I am so relieved.

414
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,480
You're relieved?Why?I was the one who had to go to the doctor visit.

415
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:08,820
No,I just mean that I'm relieved that the whole thing  is over,you know,for the both of us.

416
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,020
Let me hit you with the blunt instrument of reality,Puckerman.

417
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,440
You're still you,a douchey playboy who's gonna spend the rest of his life

418
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,160
dealing with one mess after another as long as he lives.

419
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,890
One of these days,you are gonna knock someone up,

420
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,610
and I feel bad  for whoever has to have a child that shares your DNA.

421
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,580
Hey,I'm gonna make a great father one day.

422
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:36,710
To who?Your seven kids by seven different women?Not unless you change.

423
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:42,870
Bree,look,I'm sorry,okay?I know this whole thing was really scary and traumatic...

424
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:47,510
Just do me a favor and stay away from me from now on.You're toxic.

425
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,560
Little known fact?

426
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,570
McKinley saved a bundle on new lockers by using recycled metal.

427
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:06,300
These lockers are actually Kalashnikovs  that were melted down during the war in Chechnya.

428
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,330
- Uh,Principal Sylvester,- Yes.

429
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,450
I owe you an apology.

430
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,070
I...  I get in "business mode," and I may not be that observant,

431
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,850
so I... Well,I...  might've overlooked your more... feminine side.

432
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:27,500
No worries,Superintendant.No worries.Please.

433
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:38,470
And this... is the choir room of McKinley's pride and joy,our national championship glee club,the New Directions.

434
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:45,130
Attention,McKinley School Board,Sue Sylvester has put our children  in grave danger.

435
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:51,980
There is a gas leak in this room  that is a direct result of Sue Sylvester's failed leadership!

436
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:56,390
No,there was a gas leak in this room,but I fixed it.

437
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:02,420
I know a gas-induced fantasy dance sequence  when I experience one.

438
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:08,820
And despite the fact that facilities management is under your jurisdiction,Janitor Figgins,

439
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,590
I found the problem,I corrected it  and now I'm cutting your pay in half.

440
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,210
Principal Sylvester,we've seen enough.

441
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,530
Yours is precisely the type of leadership this school needs.

442
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,350
The board would like to make you principal on a permanent basis.

443
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,990
- Congratulations,Sue.- Oh,thank you so much,Superintendant.

444
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,650
- How about we go out and celebrate?- Excuse me?

445
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:38,070
- Would you like to go out on a date with me?- Um... no.I don't want to do that.

446
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:48,920
Am I okay?I mean,is this what it feels like to be losing your mind?

447
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,970
I'm unraveling.I feel like Mel Gibson in The Beaver.

448
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:59,660
More like Mel Gibson in Mad Max,with your abs and your... leather.

449
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:00,810
Wait,what leather?

450
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:09,990
The leather I was imagining you in  when I was rubbing vapor cream all over your smooth... hairless... chest.

451
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,790
Tina,I'm engaged.

452
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,060
- Hey,what's going on?- Uh... nothing.

453
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,170
I'm-I'm just,um,cleaning my head out.Just trying to figure some stuff out.

454
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,910
- Is that supposed to be me?- What?!That's... that-that's crazy.

455
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,300
- She has Asian eyes and my exact dress.- Total coincidence.

456
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,940
Not everything is about you,Tina.What do you want?

457
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,310
I just wanted to let you know that everybody feels bad.

458
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,200
We spent pretty much the whole Glee session discussing how much pressure

459
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,010
- you're under with nationals,graduation... - The engagement.

460
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:42,750
You were just trying to exert some control.And the truth is,you should have some.You've earned it.

461
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:46,180
Sam suggested you should have the lead on one of the songs at nationals.

462
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:51,280
So we took a vote and it was unanimous.Piano,a capella,whatever you think is right.

463
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,700
- Thanks,Tina.- Of course.

464
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:58,160
So if you're done being a puppet master,do you think you could take your hand out from under my dress?

465
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:03,700
- Um... - Yeah.- Um... - It's okay.

466
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,510
- Sorry about that.- Thanks.

467
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:13,170
- I'm gonna miss having a Kurt puppet though.He did anything I said.- Anything?

468
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,170
- All right,settle down,Puppet Tina.Okay.I get it.- Blainey Days...

469
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,680
Marley.Marley,Marley,please.Please just listen.Please.

470
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,230
30 seconds.Go.

471
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,990
I miss you.Every minute of every day.

472
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,970
And I know that I screwed things up really badly,and I'm sorry.

473
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,510
I know what I lost and I know that I can't be without you.I need you.

474
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:36,690
I don't want to be this jerk anymore,and you are the only one who can make me a better person.

475
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,090
- A good person.- I'm not here to fix you,Jake.

476
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,260
I know,I know,I know.That's why I'm here.

477
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,660
To make it right,to make it better,to make me better.

478
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,890
I'm sorry,but we gave it a try and it... just wasn't right.

479
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,450
So after all that... you're saying you don't have any feelings for me?

480
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:04,710
- I think that you're a good friend and teammate... -  Marley...

481
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,680
- but I just don't feel the same as you.Not anymore.- Marley,please.

482
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,780
I got to get to class.I'll see you later in Glee Club.

483
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,740
Look,I know we don't know why Kurt called this meeting.

484
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,300
It's probably to retire the band,but we can't rub it in and say,"I told you so."

485
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,440
That would be devastating.

486
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,940
Well,I wouldn't do that,and I'm not gonna let Kurt disband Pamela Lansbury.

487
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,070
Look,I might not agree with all of his decisions,but he is our leader

488
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,400
and he's an artist,and artists should be allowed to fail.

489
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:45,670
- Who says we failed?Cronuts,anyone?- Hi.

490
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,770
Oh,this?No big deal.

491
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,780
Just a little token from the booking agency of the Williamsburg Music Hall,

492
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,260
which is the location of our second gig!

493
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,370
- What?Are you serious?- How?

494
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:59,650
Okay,true,we only had one audience member at our last show,

495
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,900
but it happened to be the right audience member because,not only was he a devoted Angela Lansbury fan,

496
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,190
but he also liked what he saw,made a secret bootleg  and passed it along to his nephew,

497
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,870
- who works at the Williamsburg Music Hall.- The Williamsburg Music Hall,which also just happens to be...

498
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,490
- One of the hottest venues in Brooklyn.Good work,fearless leader.- Well,it wasn't just me.

499
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,820
It was... also a lot of luck and-and you guys.

500
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,200
Because,you know,whether Pamela Lansbury implodes or explodes,

501
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,920
I really have to thank you guys for sticking by me.

502
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,220
- Uh,package for Kurt Hummel.- Okay.

503
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,340
- Thank you.- Thank you.

504
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,590
Oh,it's from Blaine.He sends a gift to say sorry for missing the performance the other night.

505
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,200
That's so nice!

506
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,920
Okay,that is creepy as hell.Is there one for each of us?

507
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,410
Guys,I just wanted to apologize to all of you.

508
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,190
I've been a little bit controlling lately and it's not cool.

509
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:03,090
I've made some changes though and I've learned that sometimes  you just need to let go.

510
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,280
- Cut the strings,so to speak.- I bet you'll still be bossy as hell.

511
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:11,080
Actually,I hope to be more of a leader,as opposed to being just bossy,Kitty.

512
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:17,760
So to celebrate this new laissez-faire Blaine,I've made some felt peace offerings.

513
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,860
Voila.

514
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,490
- What?- Whoa!

515
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:27,270
- It has glasses!- I think we look alike.

516
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:37,320
*Dog goes woof *Cat goes meow *Bird goes tweet *And mouse goes squeak *

517
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:46,510
*Cow goes moo *Frog goes croak *And the elephant goes toot *Ducks say quack *

518
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,930
*And fish go blub *And the seal goes ow ow ow *But there's one sound *

519
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:59,170
*That no one knows *  *What does the fox say?*

520
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,040
*Ding,ding,ding,ding,ding-ding-ding *

521
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,930
*Ding,ding,ding,ding,ding-ding-ding *

522
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,700
*Ding,ding,ding,ding,ding-ding-ding *

523
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,710
*What the fox say?*

524
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:12,060
*Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow *  *Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow *Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow *

525
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,330
*What the fox say?*

526
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:21,720
*Hee,hee,hee *A-hee,hee,hee *  *A-hee,hee,hee *What the fox say?*

527
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:29,160
*Ooh... *Ooh... *  *What does the fox say?

528
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:41,790
*The secret of the fox *Ancient mystery *Somewhere deep in the woods *

529
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:49,410
*I know you're hiding *  *What is your sound?*

530
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,670
*Will we ever know?*

531
00:41:53,320 --> 00:42:04,480
*Will always be a mystery *  *What do you say?*

532
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:15,130
*You're my guardian angel *Hiding in the woods *What is your sound?*

533
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:20,950
*Wa-wa-way-do *Wub-wid-bid-dum-way-do*Wa-wa-way-do*

534
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,350
*Will we ever know?*

535
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,940
*I want to *Wa-wa-way-do *

536
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:31,450
*Know,I want to know *I want to know *Wa-wa-way-do.*
