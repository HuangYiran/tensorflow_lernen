準備登台
We are standing by.

116
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,910
我覺得我從小到大
LILY ALDRIDGE: I have been walking up and down

117
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,200
就一直在模擬天橋走秀
fake runways my whole life, I think.

118
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,490
我第一次知道時尚秀時
The first time I was introduced to a fashion show,

119
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,180
我好像才四歲
I was, like, four years old.

120
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,740
我的夢想
LINDSAY ELLINGSON: My dream was to walk in

121
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,730
就是參加維密時尚內衣秀
the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.

122
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,170
對於來自巴西小鎮的我來說
ADRIANA LIMA: Coming from a small town in Brazil,

123
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,160
這太了不起了
it's huge.

124
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,320
我就想成為那些女孩中的一員
ALESSANDRA AMBROSIO: I just wanted to be one of those girls,

125
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,750
加入這個不可思議的大家庭
you know, and wanted to be part of this incredible family.

126
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,630
我18歲時
When I turned 18,

127
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,640
我就定下目標
I had set a goal of being

128
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,030
要參加維密時尚內衣秀
in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show

129
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,200
卻不知道這意味著什麼
and had no comprehension of what was ahead.

130
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,100
我當時年紀小  缺乏安全感  很害怕
DOUTZEN KROES: I was young and insecure and very scared.

131
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,250
我來維密的第一件事
CANDICE SWANEPOEL: The first thing I did

132
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,370
就是參加時尚內衣秀的模特選拔
with Victoria's Secret was the fashion show casting.

133
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,080
很多人問我們
Hi. MONICA MITRO: A lot of people ask us,

134
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,280
你們選拔都看重什麼
"What do you look for when you're cas?"Ting

135
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,160
對我們來說  最重要的是找到
For us, it's very, very important to have someone

136
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,420
熱情向上  積極開朗的人
who's enthusiastic and always positive and always happy--

137
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,900
我們要找一位美麗健康的女性
this gorgeous, healthy woman.

138
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,690
我從沒這麼緊張過
I had never been more nervous in my entire life.

139
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,930
把果凍和水泥混起來的感覺
If you could mix Jell-O and a cement block together...

140
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,340
-就是當時我腿的感覺  -慢點  慢點
that is how my legs felt. Slow down, slow down.

141
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,910
這是個成為巨星的好機會
This is a real opportunity

142
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,550
這是個成為巨星的好機會
to become a big star.

143
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,340
我當時很年輕  對我來說簡直不可思議
I was so young-- it was just mind-blowing for me

144
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,180
我能夠參加走秀  能夠站上天橋
that I'd booked the show and that I was there.

145
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,770
我見到了Heidi  Laetitia  Stephanie

我從沒在天橋上摔倒過
I've never fallen on the runway.

443
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,390
但世事無常  一旦發生後果極其沉重
But it's, you know, it happens, and it's awful when it does.

444
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,400
參加這個秀是每個女孩的夢想
To be in this show is a dream for every girl.

445
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,860
我十分重視它
It's a big deal.

446
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,830
去年在綵排的時候
Last year, I got there to do the rehearsal.

447
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,460
不知道怎麼回事
Then, I don't know how it happened.

448
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,380
我突然摔倒了
I just fell down.

449
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,800
我覺得我的腳踝斷了
I thought I broke my ankle.

450
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,990
恐懼感會一直縈繞在你腦海中
It's always in the back of your mind.

451
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,460
這件事真的特別可怕
It's a scary thing.

452
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,790
在綵排中扭傷腳踝
At the rehearsal,

453
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,580
然後無法參加走秀
hurt your foot, and you can't do the show?

454
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,580
這事太讓人傷心了
It was a very sad moment.

455
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:47,460
好了
Okay.

456
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,990
大家都嚇壞了
Everybody was freaking out

457
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,460
因為他們說
because they said it looked like

458
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,390
看上去很嚴重
her foot literally broke,

459
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,410
她的腳踝好像真的斷了
snapped from underneath her.

460
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,610
我當然特別沮喪
Of course, I was very upset.

461
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,330
我開始哭泣
You know, I start to cry.

462
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,110
當時的場面特別沉重
It was pretty heavy.

463
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,740
第二天  我醒來
And the next day, I woke up,

464
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,840
試著站起來
and then, I tried to put my feet on the ground.

465
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,020
還是不行
No.

466
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,420
沒法走路
No way to walk.

467
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,170
我不得不
I had to go out there

468
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,090
穿起她的裝扮  替她走秀
and walk the show in her look.

469
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,270
那感覺太糟糕了
It felt really horrible.

470
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,250
穿著她的裝扮太難受了
I felt so bad putting that outfit on,

471
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,950
因為那本是她的  不該由我去展現
'cause it wasn't mine, I wasn't supposed to have it.

472
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,760
今年  我做了更充足的準備
This year, I'm more than prepared for this show.

473
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,840
Lais  出來讓我們看看吧
Okay, Lais, can we see your outfit?

474
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,850
辣妹喲
Wow! It is hot!

475
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,890
試衣的時候
In the fitting,

476
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,260
我告訴他們  如果我又摔倒
I told them, if I fall again,

477
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,140
我一定會揮著翅膀飛起來
of course I'm gonna use my wings to fly.

478
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,940
因為去年你出了意外  所以今年
Because of what happened to you last year, we wanted you to know

479
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,920
我們希望你來走這個單元的開場

480
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920

which is called "Birds of Paradise."

481
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,550
感謝你
: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you...

482
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,520
抱歉
I'm sorry.

483
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,070
今晚  我無比興奮和快樂
Tonight, I'm more than excited, happy.

Nervous.

485
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,710
我希望Lais今年
I want for Lais, this year,

486
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,010

489
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,070
我們都會在她身後支持她
We're all gonna be behind her this year, and be, like,

490
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,230
為她歡呼
"Yeah!"

491

我一定會在後台支持她
I will definitely find Lais backstage.

祝她享受最美時刻
I want her to just have the best time.

493

602
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,020
網絡平台很自由

我每隔三四分鐘
LILY: I pick up my phone

611
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,520
就會拿起手機看看

612
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,470
每次打開手機  都會看到新的東西
Every time you pick it up, there's something else to look at.

613
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,710

619
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,960
就可能立刻毀於一旦
screw up everything I have.

620
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,320
就好像按了一個巨大的紅色按鈕
It's like the big red button.

621
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,350
一切瞬間爆炸

但我不記得是什麼了

-刪除  -我還沒碰到情況糟糕到
Delete. I haven't had, like, a shocking moment

627
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,340
我得找我的經紀人  讓他"快刪掉"
that I had to get... My agency is like, "Get that off!"

628
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,790
Instagram蒙羞

629
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,570
生命苦短  沒空在Instagram上蒙羞

這個品牌在世界上如此聞名
One of the reasons the brand is so

636
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,480
也得益於她們那些社交活動
well-known worldwide is because of their social activity.

637

這也是工作的一部分

646
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,430
