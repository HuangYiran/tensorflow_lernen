嗯哼 太有趣了

15
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,410
有趣吗 一点也没有

16
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:39,305
我 呃 才不有趣

都不瞧我们一眼

20

心率升高
Elevated heart rate.

21
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,210
坐立不安 还不是咖啡的缘故
Fidgety... not from the coffee.

22
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,695
出汗 也不是因为气候
Sweaty... and it's not the climate.

23
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:54,795
拜托了
Come on, guys.

我只是 我觉得也许是

26
00:01:57,235 --> 00:01:59,600
因为今天喝的咖啡比较浓而已

他今天有熊猫眼

你的搭档今天很怪异

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,215
- 我搭档就是怪胎  - 她说的对

32
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,195
喔 毫无反应

37
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,405
这可是第一次
This is a first.

38
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,815
你们俩就没什么要说的吗
Neither of you have anything to say.

39
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,800
不不 我

有案子 简短报告
Case on deck, quick briefing,

41
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,715
我们今天有战术任务了

42
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:39,660
- 你先走  - 不 你先走 不 你先走
- Go ahead. - No, go ahead. No, go ahead.

43

00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:41,995
- 我们得去行动中心...  - 好吧

45
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,600
分开走
separately.

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,100
不会 才不是我想的
No... no...

47
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:49,105
才不是
No!

48
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:03,015
你在想什么
A penny for your thoughts?

49
00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:04,695
早就涨价了
Price has gone up.

50
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:07,595
分享个故事都不能给个折扣
There's no discount for shared history?

51
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,690
不行 对你没有折扣
No, no discount for you,

52
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,785
因为你恰巧是少数几个懂得交易成本的人
because you're one of the few who understand the cost.

53
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,400
听着像是在恭维我
That sounds like a compliment.

54
00:03:15,605 --> 00:03:17,110
或者是诅咒
Or a curse.

55
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:23,895
还有些其他事儿浮出水面了
Something else has come up.

56
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:25,995
不是什么好事儿
You're not gonna like it.

57
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,895
两国交兵不斩来使
Don't shoot the messenger.

58
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:35,195
这只是时间问题
It was only a matter of time.

59
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,560
24小时前 一位名叫Ron Hill的
24 hours ago, a Pentagon consultant

60
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,505
五角大楼顾问在巴林海军中心指挥部被杀

他正打算传送一份夺取巴基斯坦核军火库的方案
And he was about to deliver a plan for seizing Pakistan's nuclear arsenal

如果发生政变 美国政府想确保那些
If a coup happens, the United States wants to make sure

65
00:03:58,235 --> 00:04:00,215
大规模杀伤性武器不会落入敌手
those WMDs don't fall in the wrong hands.

66
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,015
问题是 应急计划双方都能利用
Problem is, contingency plans cut both ways.

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,155
对我们来说 是解决之道
For us, it's a solution.

68
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,695
而对对方来说 则是个机会
For the other side, it's an opportunity.

69
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,350
保护巴基斯坦核武的计划 也可以借览成
The plan to secure Pakistan's nukes could also be exploited

70
00:04:09,385 --> 00:04:10,495

仅此一份 不可复制

黑市上许多买家对这种情报垂涎三尺
Lot of buyers in the black market for intel like that.

74
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:19,200
别忘了 还有很多杀手
Lot of murder suspects, too.

75
00:04:19,235 --> 00:04:20,510
凶手轻车熟路
Killer knew his blade.

76
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,395
一刀砍头 这本事可不小
Taking a head with one cut takes skill.

77
00:04:22,435 --> 00:04:24,005
我以前去过巴林基地

You hand them a knife, they'll wipe out an entire city without making a noise.

83
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,800
他们擅长各种兵刃 但是以廓尔喀刀闻名
They're good with any blade, but they made the kukri famous.

84

87
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,895
除了美国和英国以外
except for America and England.

88
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:48,600
没有什么比一个拿着刀的男人更能激发你内心的狂热了
Well, nothing brings out your inner fangirl like a guy with a knife.

89
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:52,500

143
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,805
GPS信号消失了
GPS beacon's down.

144
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,210
他们一定破解了我们的追踪方法
They must have figured out how we tracked them.

145
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,790
这帮人不是廓尔喀人
They weren't Gurkhas.

146
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:16,100
体型太大 话太多
Too big. Too loud.

147
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:17,005
没有作战技巧
No finesse.

148
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:18,790
他们是巴基斯坦人
They were Pakistani.

149
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:20,560
你放倒的枪手
The shooter you took down

150
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:22,820
是一名三军情报局的特工
was an Inter-Services Intelligence agent

151
00:08:22,855 --> 00:08:24,395
非官方身份的卧底
working under non-official cover.

152
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:26,310
廓尔喀人服役于印度军队
Gurkhas serve in the Indian military.

153
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,305
巴基斯坦和印度是毗邻的竞争对手
Pakistan and India are rivals who share a border.

154
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:31,505
有很多历史纷争
There's a lot of history there.

155
00:08:31,535 --> 00:08:32,305
许多仇恨
Lot of hate.

156
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:35,015
Hill起草计划来夺取巴基斯坦核武
Hill drew up the plan to seize the Pakistan nukes.

157
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,810
他们得确定这份计划不会流传出去
They'd love to make sure it never got out.

158
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,905
偷一个U盘并且陷害他们最大的敌人
Well, stealing a thumb drive and framing your worst enemy for murder

159
00:08:42,795 --> 00:08:46,305
- 兵行险招  - 有什么想法呢
- it's a pretty bold move. - Thoughts?

160
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:50,895
这符合巴基斯坦情报机关的思维
It's consistent with our profile of the Pakistani spy agency's mindset.

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,700
附议
Agreed.

162
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:54,495
不好意思
Excuse me.

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,800
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

164
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:07,905
- 有什么事吗  - 是的
- Something we should know? - Yeah.

165
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,290
还有两名ISI特工还未到案
Two more ISI agents are on the loose,

166
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,490
他们手上有U盘
and they have the thumb drive.

167
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,600
找到他们
Find 'em.

168
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:14,995
好的
Okay.

169
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,210
24小时之前 你本该抓住机会开枪
24 hours ago, you would have taken that shot.

170
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,500
- 我没有机会  - 不 你有的
- I didn't have the shot. - Yes, you did.

171
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,990
好吧 昨天 我是该开枪的
Okay, yesterday, I would have taken the shot,

172
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:51,905
但现在已经不是昨天了 对吗
but it's not yesterday anymore... is it?

173
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,610
对吗
Is it?

174
00:09:58,405 --> 00:10:00,105
发生了什么
What happened out there?

175
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:02,710
跟往常行动没什么区别
Same thing that happens every time we go kinetic.

176
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,305
有些意外的事情发生了 我们赶紧补救
Variables got in the way, and decisions were made.

177
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,500
我们正在进行行动后的汇报
We ran our after-action debrief,

178
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,805
正有所进展
and we're moving forward.

179
00:10:08,835 --> 00:10:11,605
但是意外还没解决啊 Hanna先生
But the variables are still out there, Mr. Hanna.

180
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,505
我们会找回U盘的
We'll recover the thumb drive.

181
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,090
我不是在说U盘
The thumb drive is not what I'm referring to.

182
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,095
你的队伍 准备好出任务了吗
Is your team mission-ready?

183
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,115
希望吧
I hope so.

184
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:27,395
这个嘛 希望可不是个计划 Callen先生
Well, hope is not a plan, Mr. Callen.

185
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,715
好吧
Okay.

186
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:43,205
我该开枪的
I should have taken the shot,

187
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:46,840
我让我的感情妨碍了工作 很抱歉
and I let my emotions get in the way, and I'm sorry.

188
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,310
我真的尽力做到感情和工作互不干涉了
I'm honestly just trying to make this work.

189
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,805
这不可能的
It's not going to work.

190
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,995
我好像正站在冰冻的湖面上
I'm standing on my frozen lake.

191
00:10:58,195 --> 00:10:59,495
我不知道你什么意思
I don't know what that means.

192
00:11:00,295 --> 00:11:01,795
这是我从菲律宾格斗课学到的
It's something that I learned in Sayoc.

193
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,406
冰湖这个词 代表你在这世上
Your frozen lake is the name for what you want

194
00:11:06,886 --> 00:11:09,090
最想要的东西 你想拥有它
the most in the world, and you want it...

195
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:11,083
你渴求得到它
you want it so bad

196
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,298
宁愿为此付出一切
that you'll do anything to get it.

197
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,993
你的心在驱使着行动
And your heart takes over.

198
00:11:18,953 --> 00:11:20,141
但是正因如此
But because of that...

199
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:22,572
它最后会毁了你
it destroys you in the end.

200
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,310
你想要的就在那儿 就在冰封的湖面中间待着
It's right there, just sitting in the middle of this frozen lake.

201
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:30,012
你觉得自己速度够快
And you think you're fast enough to...

202
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,190
能在冰面碎裂之前 过去抓住它
to go out there and grab it before the ice cracks...

203
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,270
不过你没有发现的是
And what you don't realize is...

204
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,640
自己已经站在冰上
you're already standing on the ice

205
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,827
而且冰面正在你周围开裂
and it's falling apart around you.

206
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,806
呃 洛杉矶警方刚找到了尸体
Um, LAPD just found a body.

207
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,307
是旅店的其中一个枪手
One of the shooters from the hotel.

208
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,446
好勒
Good.

209
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,732
倒数第二个ISI特工
Second-to-last ISI agent.

210
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,255
一招毙命
One cut, one kill.

211
00:12:10,806 --> 00:12:12,012
洛杉矶警方怎么说
What did LAPD say?

212
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,236
他们没找到U盘
They didn't find the thumb drive.

213
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,338
凶手消失得无影无踪
The last shooter's in the wind.

214
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,680
他们跑了
Well, they were on the run.

215
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,778
他们可能对事态升级情况达不成一致吧
Could've had a disagreement that escalated.

216
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:18,972
但是他们有枪
But they had guns.

217
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,646
如果情况恶化 为什么还非得用刀呢
If it escalated, why mess around with knives?

218
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,723
为什么不直接打死呢
Why not just shoot someone?

219
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,661
也许不是意见不合
Maybe it wasn't a disagreement.

220
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,015
可能是个埋伏
Maybe it was an ambush.

221
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,335
让一个极度反感被诬陷为谋杀
An ambush by someone who doesn't take kindly

222
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,212
和从事间谍活动的人伏击了
to being framed for murder and espionage.

223
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:31,340
有道理
Yeah.

224
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:33,981
他可能也没跑那么远
Maybe he's closer than we think.

225
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:37,649
Sam
Sam?

226
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,800
没错
Yup.

227
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:42,190
注意那把刀
Watch for the blade.

228
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,181
带刀来参加枪战 够他喝一壶了
Bring a knife to a gunfight, he'll see what happens.

229
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,606
没法开枪
No shot!

230
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:33,280
知道吗 这就是我说带刀来枪战的后果
What was that I said about bringing a knife to a gunfight?

231
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,713
没有U盘
No thumb drive.

232
00:13:39,624 --> 00:13:40,492
你是谁
Who are you?

233
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:42,129
Jemadar Thapa
Jemadar Thapa,

234
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:44,356
廓尔喀第五步枪团
5th Gurkha Rifle Regiment,

235
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:46,455
边防部队
Frontier Force.

236
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,169
Jai Maa kali, Ayo Gorkhali
Jai Maa kali, Ayo Gorkhali.

237
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,033
"胜利归于吾神时母
"Victory to the Goddess Kali,

238
00:13:54,258 --> 00:13:55,593
廓尔喀部队来了"
the Gurkhas are coming."

239
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:57,950
他们的作战口号
It's their war cry.

240
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:16,418
如果有人告诉你他不怕死
If a man tells you he's not afraid of dying

241
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,153
这人不是说谎就是廓尔喀人
he's either lying or he's a Gurkha.

242
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:20,535
你肯定听说过这个 对吧
I take it you've heard that one, huh?

243
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:23,243
从第一次说的人口中听来的
From the man who said it first,

244
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,587
已故陆军元帅Sam Manekshaw
the late Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw,

245
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:27,310
印度陆军参谋长
Indian Army Chief of Staff,

246
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,344
我的导师
my mentor.

247
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:29,046
嗯
Mm.

248
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:31,520
那他会支持你实施谋杀吗
Would he approve of you committing murder?

249
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:34,732
更别提在美国领土上袭击两名联邦探员了
Not to mention attacking two federal agents on American soil?

250
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:36,430
印度国防部
India's Ministry of Defense

251
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,436
派我来为廓尔喀正名
sent me here to clear the Gurkha name.

252
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:40,190
你为什么逃跑
Then why'd you run?

253
00:14:41,286 --> 00:14:43,580
我不想在一个巴基斯坦间谍拿着
I did not want to waste time playing diplomat

254
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:46,387
敏感情报逃跑这种事情上花时间费口舌
while a Pakistani spy is on the run with sensitive intel.

255
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,953
如果我们想让你花时间 你现在就已经蹲监狱了
If we wanted to waste your time, you'd be in a prison right now.

256
00:14:49,064 --> 00:14:49,876
顺便一提
And for the record,

257
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,378
那个敏感情报
that sensitive intel

258
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,249
由美国所有
is U.S. Property.

259
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:56,221
我不关心情报
The intel is not my concern.

260
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,009
没错 你在意的是复仇
No, your concern is revenge.

261
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:00,473
我管它叫荣誉
I call it honor.

262
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,446
荣誉吗
Honor?

263
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,655
你只为了这个才来这里吗 Thapa
Is that really the only reason you're here, Thapa?

264
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:09,415
我执行命令
I carry out my orders.

265
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:11,298
仅此而已
No more, no less.

266
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,341
没错 不过那个U盘还蛮有诱惑的 不是吗
Yeah, but that thumb drive's pretty tempting, isn't it?

267
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,713
挫败巴基斯坦核计划的行动方案
An operational plan to seize Pakistan's nukes;

268
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,861
让你们国家迫在眉睫的威胁彻底消失
to make the looming threat against your country disappear forever.

269
00:15:23,895 --> 00:15:25,803
没准你的长官没告诉你要把它带回去
Maybe your command didn't tell you to bring it back...

270
00:15:28,203 --> 00:15:30,541
但你要是带回去了 必定受到英雄般的欢迎
but you'd get a hero's welcome if you did.

271
00:15:31,255 --> 00:15:33,163
就说你手上有U盘吧
Let's say you got your hands on the thumb drive.

272
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,461
你会说你会把它交给我们
You tell me you're just going to hand it over to us

273
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,243
然后一走了之吗
and walk away?

274
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,876
想让他交出U盘 必须经历一场恶战
There's no way he's giving up this thumb drive without a fight.

275
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,698
五角大楼说Thapa没问题
Pentagon says that Thapa checks out,

276
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,846
就是说官方已经确认他和我们在同一战线了
which means he's officially on our side.

277
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,529
他的妻子和三个孩子在西孟加拉邦
He's got a wife and three kids in West Bengal.

278
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,658
巴基斯坦只要一个袭击就能炸平那里
A strike by Pakistan would wipe them out.

279
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,633
你真觉得他能为了保证他们的安全而不去冒险吗
You really think he's going to give up a shot at keeping them safe?

280
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,689
只要他能控制情绪
If he can control his emotions.

281
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,664
事到行时才觉难啊
A lot easier said than done.

282
00:16:02,184 --> 00:16:04,190
是啊 只要在意 就都不再简单了
Well, it's never easy when you start to care.

283
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,252
我猜那U盘就是他的冰湖吧
I guess this makes the thumb drive his frozen lake?

284
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:12,473
估计是了
Guess it does.

285
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:19,144
他会做正确的选择的
He'll do the right thing.

286
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:27,458
"白色幽灵"是个危险又诡秘的人
The White Ghost is a dangerous and elusive man.

287
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:30,043
这不是个简单的任务啊 Owen
This is not an easy mission, Owen.

288
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,981
所以我才亲自上阵
Which is why I'm running it myself.

289
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,104
你需要一个快速响应小组
You're going to need a QRF.

290
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:39,193
我让我的队伍随时待命
I'll keep my team on standby.

291
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:41,476
你在这儿掌能管一切 Henrietta
You've got your hands full right here, Henrietta,

292
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,003
不过我确实很感激这个提议
but I do appreciate the offer.

293
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:47,427
看来岁月让你变得温和了
It seems the years have made you kind.

294
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:53,772
有吗
Have they?

295
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:56,683
正在找最后的枪手 不过
Looking for the last shooter, but...

296
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,027
他参加过反监控训练 找他得花上大把时间
given his countersurveillance training, it's a long shot.

297
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,132
等一下 酒店那里用来逃跑的那辆车呢
Wait, what about the getaway car from the hotel?

298
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,363
它一直没出现
It still hasn't shown up.

299
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,504
我已经通过万花筒在找相同外观和型号的轿车了
I've got Kaleidoscope searching sedans of that make and model.

300
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,692
现在咱只能等了
Well, all we can do is wait.

301
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:11,600
我觉得
I think...

302
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,741
我不想知道你怎么想Kensi和Deeks的
I don't want to know what you think about Kensi and Deeks.

303
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,341
我没说我在想啊
I didn't say what I was thinking.

304
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,193
但是我知道你在想
But I know what you're thinking.

305
00:17:17,723 --> 00:17:18,800
所以 你也在想这个
So, you're thinking it, too?

306
00:17:21,544 --> 00:17:22,566
你觉得Hetty知道吗
You think Hetty knows?

307
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:26,061
我想 Hetty什么都知道
Hetty knows everything, I think.

308
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,420
咱俩想的一样
That's what I thought.

309
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,953
私人跑道
Private airstrip.

310
00:17:31,729 --> 00:17:32,307
什么
Huh?

311
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,541
那个枪手 他得从美国逃走
The last shooter... he needs to leave the country

312
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,800
但是他的受训经验告诉他 要避开像洛杉矶国际机场这种枢纽
but he's trained to avoid major hubs like LAX

313
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,793
因为他知道我们会在哪里监控
because he knows that's where we'd be looking.

314
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,055
没错 但是万花筒已经找过私人停机坪了
Okay, but Kaleidoscope already searched private airstrip parking lots.

315
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:45,876
搜索私人停机坪周围的停机坪
Search major parking lots around the parking lots.

316
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,587
方圆五英里范围
In a five-mile radius.

317
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,218
离Pacoima的Whiteman机场
Sedan matching that description

318
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,304
两英里远有辆符合特征的车
two miles from Whiteman Airport in Pacoima.

319
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,501
没错 很合理 地方小 不是中央枢纽
Yep, makes sense... it's small, not a major hub.

320
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:00,824
我跟其他人说
I'll tell the others.

321
00:18:00,984 --> 00:18:02,443
帮我接Callen探员
Get me Agent Callen.

322
00:18:06,178 --> 00:18:07,347
明白 Hetty
Understood, Hetty.

323
00:18:09,113 --> 00:18:10,455
咱得改变计划了
We got a change of plans.

324
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,615
Thapa跟着我们去跑道那里
Thapa's coming with us to the airstrip.

325
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,252
坏主意
It's a bad idea.

326
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,243
是啊 没准
Yeah, probably.

327
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,166
海军部长希望我们对他像自己的队友一样
SECNAV wants us to treat him like a member of the team.

328
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,633
她希望能促进我们和印度的关系
She's hoping to bolster relations with India.

329
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,304
海军部长从来没被这家伙的刀抵住过喉咙
SECNAV never had this little dude's knife to her throat.

330
00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:25,630
我去枪械室给Thapa拿把枪
I'll get Thapa a gun from the armory.

331
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:28,424
不用 Deeks 把刀给他
No. Deeks, handle his stuff.

332
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:29,889
Kensi 你跟我和Sam走
Kensi, you're coming with Sam and me.

333
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:30,800
什
Wh...?

334
00:18:32,504 --> 00:18:33,883
给你俩分开一下
You two could use some space.

335
00:18:36,313 --> 00:18:37,170
明白
Understood.

336
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:42,769
有问题吗
You got this?

337
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,800
没问题
I got this.

338
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,446
欢迎入队
Welcome aboard.

339
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:01,206
谢谢
Thank you.

340
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,366
嗯 你的热枕势不可挡啊
Well, your enthusiasm is overwhelming.

341
00:19:04,683 --> 00:19:06,012
我喜欢单独行动
I prefer to work alone.

342
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:08,098
我以前也这么觉得
Hmm, I used to feel the same way.

343
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,332
什么令你变了
What changed?

344
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:11,987
我发现有人值得去信任
I found somebody worth trusting.

345
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:13,944
你的队友信任我
And your team trusts me?

346
00:19:14,449 --> 00:19:16,695
我不能替他们说 不过 呃
I can't really speak for my team, but, uh...

347
00:19:21,156 --> 00:19:21,883
我相信你
...I do.

348
00:19:24,603 --> 00:19:25,292
为什么
Why?

349
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:28,920
问得太好了
It's a damn good question.

350
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,184
我知道你想要U盘
I understand that you want the thumb drive.

351
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,713
而且我知道 如果我是你 我也想拿到
And I get that, 'cause if I was you, I'd want it, too.

352
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,003
因为这次行动 它让你变成了累赘
And for this mission, that makes you a liability.

353
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,495
但是你有能力
But you got this.

354
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:42,178
你相信我能办成
You believe I can do it?

355
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:44,307
我的理智可以胜过情感吗
That my brain will win over my heart?

356
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,753
兄弟 我得去相信
Brother, I got to believe that,

357
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,009
因为如果你能做到 我也能
'cause if you can do it, so can I.

358
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,006
Jemadar Thapa

Marty Deeks警探 洛杉矶警方
Detective Marty Deeks. LAPD.

362
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:57,993
廓尔喀的部队有句座右铭
The Gurkhas have a saying:

363
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:00,621
"宁可战死 不愿苟活"
"Better to die than be a coward."

364
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:05,144
哇哦 我觉得我搭档上辈子是个廓尔喀人
Wow. I think my regular partner was a Gurkha in a past life.

365
00:20:05,513 --> 00:20:06,596
那他一定很勇敢
Then he must be brave.

366
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:07,624
应该是 她
Well, she...

367
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:10,541
她是最勇敢的
...she's the bravest.

368
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:12,800
我不会让您失望 先生
I will not let you down, sahib.

369
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:16,720
好的
Okay.

训练有素的巴基斯坦飞行员

371
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,670
只要一架飞机就能办成一切
All he's goona need is a plane.

372
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:32,652
风向合适吗
You got a good wind?

373
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:33,710
合适
Yeah.

374
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,430
角度没问题吧
Got yourself a nice angle?

375
00:20:36,812 --> 00:20:37,495
没问题
Yep.

376
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:40,880
1500码也没问题
Still automatic from 1,500 yards?

377
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:42,609
对
Yep.

378
00:20:51,513 --> 00:20:53,587
这孩子真爱敞开了说啊 是吧
Loves to open up about her feelings, doesn't she?

379
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:57,930
你从来没有搭档吗
So you've never had a partner?

380
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,089
没有
No.

381
00:20:59,747 --> 00:21:00,966
廓尔喀部队没有女兵吗
There's no female Gurkhas?

382
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,264
没有
No.

383
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,846
那你就偷着乐去吧
Well, you should consider yourself lucky then.

384
00:21:06,178 --> 00:21:08,436
我是说 你看我 我已经站在冰封的湖面了
I mean, look at me, I'm standing on a frozen lake.

385
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,415
我说话的感觉都有点像她了
And I'm beginning to sound like her.

386
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:13,852
人心需要自律
The heart needs discipline.

387
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:17,300
没有纪律 就没有荣誉
Without discipline there is no honor.

388
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:19,568
没有了荣誉 我们什么都不是

389
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:23,069
你知道吗 你还挺有意思的 Thapa
You know what, you're pretty cool, Thapa.

390
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:24,503
有那么一瞬间
For a second there, I forgot

391
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:26,254
我都忘了你今天早上还砍下了某人的头
that you chopped off some guy's head this morning.

392
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:28,796
要穿过冰封的湖面只有一个办法

Stand by, Deeks.

396
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:41,274
看起来他要和别人会面
Looks like he's meeting somebody.

397
00:21:42,492 --> 00:21:44,210
他不可能回到巴基斯坦
He will never make it back to Pakistan.

398
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,520
他的护照被标记了
His passport has been tagged.

399
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:46,280
他会被抓住的
He will be caught.

400
00:21:47,237 --> 00:21:50,503
在Glendale的亚美尼亚犯罪集团
是洛杉矶附近办假证中最拿手的
Armenian Mob in Glendale has the best forgery operation in L.A.

401
00:21:50,523 --> 00:21:52,524
他的第一件事肯定就是办个假护照
Fake passport would've been his first stop for sure.

402
00:21:53,151 --> 00:21:54,141
这并不是问题
It does not matter.

403
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:55,879
- 他是个将死之人了  - 不 不 不
- He is a dead man. - No. No, no.

404
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,363
不要死人 好吗 我们得活捉他
No dead man, all right, we need to take him alive,

405
00:21:57,408 --> 00:21:58,754
要不留痕迹 漂亮地完成 明白了吗
tie up any loose ends, you got that?

406
00:21:58,874 --> 00:21:59,613

00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:01,646
你一看见那个U盘 就行动

00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:12,659

00:22:16,907 --> 00:22:17,352
放下武器
Drop it!

417
00:22:19,632 --> 00:22:21,045
- 注意了望  - 收到
- Hold overwatch. - Check.

418
00:22:44,699 --> 00:22:45,666
Thapa失踪了
Thapa's MIA.

419
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:46,546
Eric
Eric?

420
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,174
正在扫瞄跑道附近的摄像头
Scanning airstrip cams now.

421
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:07,317
Kensi
Kensi?

422
00:23:07,437 --> 00:23:09,483
- 那个廓尔喀人去哪了  - 我看不见Thapa
- The Gurkha? - No visual on Thapa.

423
00:23:15,235 --> 00:23:15,785
见鬼
Damn it.

424
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,137
不 不
No, no.

425
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:26,425
U盘不见了
Thumb drive's gone.

426
00:23:51,284 --> 00:23:52,570
让我猜猜 你有个坏消息
Let me guess. You got bad news

427
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:55,609
然后还有个更坏的消息
and then you got "Fredo at the end of Godfather Part II" bad news.

428
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:57,754
棒级了 先告诉我坏消息吧
Awesome. Give me the bad news first.

429
00:23:57,874 --> 00:24:00,191
这消息是不太好 但我不是送消息的人 Deeks
The news isn't good, but I'm not a messenger, Deeks.

430
00:24:00,311 --> 00:24:01,817
那你是来给我加油打气的
So, what, you're the guy that gives me the pep talk?

431
00:24:01,937 --> 00:24:04,210
我是来提醒你 你并不是孤军奋战
I'm the one that reminds you you're not in this alone.

432
00:24:04,668 --> 00:24:05,442
坏消息是
Here's the bad news:

433
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:07,300
情况是 那巴基斯坦人
What happened was that the Pakistanis

434
00:24:07,328 --> 00:24:09,475
今天早上 在网上找了个有飞机的人
found a plane owner online earlier today,

435
00:24:10,362 --> 00:24:12,691
付钱让机主开飞机带他兜风
offered him cash for a ride. Owner had no idea

436
00:24:12,735 --> 00:24:13,869
机主完全不知道他牵涉了什么
what he'd gotten himself into.

437
00:24:14,143 --> 00:24:16,001
他在踏上跑道那刻就死了
Dead the moment he stepped on the tarmac.

438
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,860
好吧 告诉我那条更糟糕的消息
Okay. Give me Fredo.

439
00:24:18,594 --> 00:24:20,464
Thapa溜了 而且没留下什么线索
Thapa's in the wind. No trace of him.

440
00:24:21,513 --> 00:24:23,371
嗯 Eric正在从监控录像里搜索
Right. Eric's searching cam footage,

441
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:26,346
全州通缉 FBI 警犬队已经开始行动
statewide APB, FBI K-9 units are in route.

442
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:29,047
你觉得这些措施能阻止一个拿到了
And you think all that's enough to hunt down a Gurkha carrying the holy grail

443
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:30,117
绝密情报的廓尔喀军人吗
of intel in his pocket?

444
00:24:30,156 --> 00:24:31,721
他的信用卡和银行账户都被冻结了
His credit cards and bank accounts are frozen.

445
00:24:32,194 --> 00:24:34,861
印度政府因他违抗命令而将他除名了
Indian government disavowed him for violating direct orders.

446
00:24:35,857 --> 00:24:37,684
这是个国际事件
This is an international incident.

447
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:39,976
Thapa是整个洛杉矶里的头号通缉犯
Thapa's the most wanted man in L.A.

448
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:41,733
我知道 而且是我相信了他
Yeah, I know. And I'm the one that trusted him.

449
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,917
- 可能你刚才没听见我说的话  - 我听见了
- Maybe you didn't hear me just now. - No, I did.

450
00:24:43,944 --> 00:24:45,114
我不是孤军奋战 我明白
I'm not alone. I got it.

451
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:47,300
听着 呃
Listen, uh,

452
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:48,989
准确起见 是Kensi让我
just for the record, Kensi told me

453
00:24:49,016 --> 00:24:50,283
在酒店里开火的
to take that shot at the hotel.

454
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:52,236
过去的我会开火
I've made that shot before. I've been there,

455
00:24:52,262 --> 00:24:54,871
但我在那里 却没有开枪
I've done that, I got the T-shirt, I just didn't take it.

456
00:24:55,117 --> 00:24:56,155
那让我们接着来
So get us back in the game.

457
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:02,367
我知道怎么找到Thapa并且拿回那个U盘
I know a way to find Thapa and get the thumb drive back.

458
00:25:03,026 --> 00:25:04,689
看来你好像知道些我们所不知道的事
Something tells me you know something we don't.

459
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,352
很疯狂 不是吗
Crazy, right?

460
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:16,117
Hetty 我能处理好的
Hetty, I can make this right.

461
00:25:17,402 --> 00:25:19,496
你有不少问题 Deeks先生
You have several problems, Mr. Deeks.

462
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,203
你想谈的是哪一个
Which one are we talking about?

463
00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:24,814
我说的是那个廓尔喀人
I'm talking about the Gurkha.

464
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,107
我有个关于廓尔喀人的计划
I have a plan for the Gurkha.

465
00:25:26,227 --> 00:25:26,855
啊
Ah.

466
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:29,028
我确信这会是个好主意
I'm sure it's brilliant.

467
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:30,524
告诉我
Tell me.

468
00:25:30,893 --> 00:25:33,716
我真心觉得这人不会像个混混一样
I honestly don't think that this guy's gonna go rogue

469
00:25:33,718 --> 00:25:35,368
把这个U盘拍卖出去
and sell the thumb drive to the highest bidder.

470
00:25:36,257 --> 00:25:37,999
我是说 你想啊 他 他是个爱国者
I mean, think about this. He's a... he's a patriot,

471
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:40,774
他是个军人 如果他要把情报带回去
he's a soldier, and if he brings home the information

472
00:25:40,776 --> 00:25:42,364
以打击巴基斯坦
to neutralize Pakistan, there's a good chance

473
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:43,341
印度很可能会让他回去的
India's gonna take him back.

474
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:44,106
嗯嗯
Mm-hmm.

475
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:48,065
请求原谅总是比征得同意要好些
Always better to beg forgiveness than ask permission.

476
00:25:48,408 --> 00:25:48,760
正是
Exactly.

477
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,266
那他的下一步行动会是啥
So what's his next step?

478
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:52,615
他得离开洛杉矶
He's got to get out of Los Angeles,

479
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:54,207
这意味着他需要有一本新护照
which means he needs a new passport,

480
00:25:54,401 --> 00:25:56,406
他需要一个新的身份 而且根据目前他被通缉的情况
he needs a new identity and, given the heat that's on him,

481
00:25:56,442 --> 00:25:57,269
他的新身份必须完美无瑕
it's got to be perfect.

482
00:25:57,735 --> 00:26:00,093
这任务可不简单啊 Deeks先生
That's a large task, Mr. Deeks.

483
00:26:01,122 --> 00:26:02,850
Thapa对这城市里很陌生
Thapa's a stranger in this city.

484
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,408
他怎么知道该去哪
How would he know where to go?

485
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:05,850
我告诉他了
Because I told him.

486
00:26:07,786 --> 00:26:08,657
我 呃
I, um...

487
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:12,325
提到了Glandale里 一处亚美尼亚犯罪集团办假证的地方
mentioned the Armenian Mob franchise in Glendale.

488
00:26:13,442 --> 00:26:15,211
那里由一个叫Talita Pambakian的女人运作
It's run by a woman named Talita Pambakian.

489
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:19,085
- 你知道她的住址  - 我花了两个星期
- You know her location?  - I spent two weeks

490
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,146
为洛杉矶警方做卧底 渗透进他她的组织
infiltrating her group, working undercover for LAPD.

491
00:26:22,507 --> 00:26:25,041
我们建立了联系 她以为我是个律师
We established contact. She thinks I'm a lawyer.

492
00:26:25,358 --> 00:26:26,255
然后发生什么了
And what happened?

493
00:26:28,516 --> 00:26:30,991
她察觉了他身边的另一个卧底
She found out there was another cop working undercover

494
00:26:30,993 --> 00:26:31,840
并且将他射杀了
and she shot him in the head.

495
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:37,910
显然 洛杉矶警方中止了行动 把我拉了出来
Obviously, LAPD shut it down and then they pulled me out.

496
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:43,110
你现在想重新建立联系
And you want to reestablish contact.

497
00:26:43,391 --> 00:26:44,896
Thapa正在去见她的路上
Thapa's on his way to see her right now.

498
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,685
我只需要在那里制服他就行了
All I got to do is beat him there.

499
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,787
你需要一套西装
You need a suit.

500
00:26:57,186 --> 00:26:57,848
Hetty向你做简报了吗
Hetty brief you?

501
00:26:58,165 --> 00:26:58,446
嗯
Yeah.

502
00:26:59,713 --> 00:27:01,156
我们评估了行动地点
We assessed the location in Ops

503
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:02,521
说实话 我不喜欢
and, honestly, I don't like it.

504
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,358
如果有什么意外 我们很难赶来
Makes it impossible for us to reach you if something goes wrong.

505
00:27:05,688 --> 00:27:07,315
没得选 这是唯一的办法
Not much of a choice. It's the only way.

506
00:27:09,144 --> 00:27:10,841
或者你其实觉得这是唯一能挽回
Or you mean the only way to redeem yourself

507
00:27:10,883 --> 00:27:12,079
关于旅店及Thapa这些事的方法
for the hotel and Thapa?

508
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:18,485
你能帮我个忙吗
Can you do something for me?

509
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:20,505
啥
What?

510
00:27:22,694 --> 00:27:25,136
就现在 你能不能假装我不是Deeks
Can you, for a second, just pretend that I'm not Deeks

511
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:28,397
而你也不是Kensi
and, for a second, pretend that you're not Kensi

512
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:29,483
我们不是搭档
and that we're not partners

513
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:30,926
我们也没有天天去拯救世界什么的
and no one's trying to save the planet?

514
00:27:31,644 --> 00:27:34,466
能不能假装我们只是
Can we pretend for a second that we're just a boy and a girl

515
00:27:34,508 --> 00:27:35,254
一起厮混的男女
who are hanging out?

516
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:37,602
我们能
We can...

517
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:40,473
开着我的皮卡 去买冰淇淋
drive around in my pickup truck, go get ice cream,

518
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:41,775
打保龄球
go bowling.

519
00:27:44,968 --> 00:27:47,509
我们有无限多的可能
But that's the thing because the possibilities are endless.

520
00:27:49,022 --> 00:27:49,592
我们很年轻
We're young.

521
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:51,988
我们有大把的时间
We have all the time in the world.

522
00:28:00,284 --> 00:28:01,776
我是Fern 嗨
My name is Fern. Hi.

523
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:04,085
你是Fern
You're Fern.

524
00:28:05,838 --> 00:28:09,221
呃 见到你 很高兴 Fern 我是Max
Well, so nice to... so nice to meet you, Fern. I'm Max.

525
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:09,976
幸会幸会
Nice to meet you.

526
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:11,851
今晚有空吗
You have any plans for tonight?

527
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:13,808
不知道 这很复杂
I don't know. It's complicated.

528
00:28:13,836 --> 00:28:15,110
呃 在我看来没啥复杂的嘛
Well, not from where I'm standing, it's not.

529
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,067
我有男朋友了
I have a boyfriend.

530
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:17,299
我也有女朋友了
So is my girlfriend.

531
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:20,447
西装很漂亮 是啊
That's a nice suit. Yeah.

532
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:23,146
问题是
The problem with it is

533
00:28:23,172 --> 00:28:24,554
这衣服太紧了
that's it's too-too tight.

534
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,922
很难藏起武器
It's gonna be hard to conceal a weapon.

535
00:28:27,092 --> 00:28:29,045
Talita对我做的第一件事就会是搜身
The first thing Talita's guys are gonna do are pat me down.

536
00:28:29,987 --> 00:28:30,998
他们总要发现的
They're gonna find it anyway.

537
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:37,260
给你
Here.

538
00:28:40,488 --> 00:28:41,676
不 我 我不能拿这个
No, I-I can't take that.

539
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:43,154
我的搭档不能毫无防范地去执行任务
My partner doesn't go unarmed.

540
00:28:43,832 --> 00:28:44,175
拿着它
Take it.

541
00:28:50,464 --> 00:28:53,553
我还从没遇到一个女人给我 呃 她的刀
I've never had a girl give me her, uh... knife before.

542
00:28:53,552 --> 00:28:56,219
这是不是意味着我们正式确定了关系
Does that mean that we are... official?

543
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:02,114
呃 有时候这仅仅是把刀而已
Eh, sometimes a knife is just a knife.

544
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:13,560
来吧 Eric 给我们报告
All right, take us through it, Eric.

545
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,422
那些墙很结实 厚而且结实
Those walls are concrete. Thick concrete.

546
00:29:16,773 --> 00:29:18,744
结构也很完整 唯一的入口
The structural integrity's sound, the only way in

547
00:29:18,788 --> 00:29:20,672
是通过前门 外面有两个守卫
is through the front door. There are the two guards

548
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,800
可能在墙后还有更多人
out front and probably more inside that we can't see.

549
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,060
Talita在哪
Where's Talita located?

550
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:26,966
结构图表明
Uh, schematics show

551
00:29:27,011 --> 00:29:28,735
建筑的后方有一间办公室
an office in the back of the building,

552
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,780
但是 要去那里的话
but you'll have to make it through

553
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,950
你必须穿过那条狭窄的走廊
 a narrow hallway to get there.

554
00:29:31,943 --> 00:29:32,717
致命的危险区
Fatal funnel.

555
00:29:33,456 --> 00:29:35,075
- 战略上的噩梦  - 的确是
- Strategic nightmare. - Yeah.

556
00:29:43,456 --> 00:29:43,906
信号良好吗
Comm's good?

557
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:45,539
很清楚
Loud and clear.

558
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:01,430
我是来见Talita的
Here to see Talita.

559
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,720
你有预约吗
- You got an appointment?

560
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,910
告诉她Marty Finch来见她了
Tell her Marty Finch is here to see her.

561
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:07,247
你或许是个警察呢 Marty Finch
Maybe you're a cop, Marty Finch.

562
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,930
打电话给她的律师
Call her lawyer.

563
00:30:09,204 --> 00:30:10,993
真巧 因为我就是她的律师
Well, that's perfect timing 'cause I am her lawyer.

564
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:15,263
有个叫Marty Finch的人在这儿
Guy named Marty Finch is here.

565
00:30:16,307 --> 00:30:17,031
把他带到后面来
Send him back.

566
00:30:17,721 --> 00:30:18,108
好的
Yeah.

567
00:30:19,826 --> 00:30:20,318
他可以进去
He's good.

568
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:21,550
我们走
Let's go.

569
00:30:28,946 --> 00:30:30,100
右手边第一道门
First door on the right.

570
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:38,828
你是那位在09年解决了
You're the guy who made those narco charges go away

571
00:30:38,856 --> 00:30:39,743
那些关于毒品指控的人吗
back in '09?

572
00:30:42,953 --> 00:30:44,544
现在交出你身上的武器
Hand over any weapons now.

573
00:30:44,966 --> 00:30:46,015
我没带武器
I'm not carrying.

574
00:30:47,338 --> 00:30:48,879
在找线路
Look for a wire, too...

575
00:30:49,752 --> 00:30:51,058
那个区域是建筑里的
Comms deadzone in that sector

576
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,895
通信盲区 我无能为力了
of the building, guys. My hands are tied.

577
00:30:54,844 --> 00:30:55,710
那我们等
Then we wait.

578
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:57,142
你没问题吧
You good?

579
00:31:01,182 --> 00:31:01,815
我很好
I'm good.

580
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:14,295
你很享受嘛
You enjoying yourself?

581
00:31:15,822 --> 00:31:16,357
他没带武器
He's clean.

582
00:31:23,629 --> 00:31:25,290
从坟墓里爬出来了 律师
Back from the dead, counselor?

583
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:28,826
Talita 我没死 只是非常忙
Not dead, Talita, just incredibly busy.

584
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,888
如果你不为我工作
If you're not working for me,

585
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:33,665
那都一样
it's all the same.

586
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:35,896
来听听你的说辞吧
Let's hear your pitch.

587
00:31:36,177 --> 00:31:38,275
你是来推销业务 是吧
You've come to peddle your wares, right?

588
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,280
说到这儿 我是不是该说你依然漂亮
Is this the part where I tell you you still look good

589
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,520
还有 你的生意越来越旺了
and your business is thriving?

590
00:31:42,516 --> 00:31:44,353
问题是我从不对顾客说谎
Only problem is I don't lie to clients.

591
00:31:44,712 --> 00:31:45,908
你死定了 Talita
You're screwed, Talita.

592
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,040
洛杉矶警方会来找你麻烦
LAPD's coming for you.

593
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,130
他们知道当卧底出现在我家门口时 会发生什么
They knowwhat happens when undercovers show up at my door.

594
00:31:51,517 --> 00:31:53,248
对你来说很不幸 他们惦记着你
And, unfortunately for you, they don't forget.

595
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,644
我线人说你现在还有个人在找你麻烦
My source says you have another one coming your way right now.

596
00:31:56,694 --> 00:32:00,227
小个子 有一米六七 深色皮肤 还带着一套卧底说辞
Small guy, maybe five-five, dark skin with an undercover

597
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:02,666
需要返回印度的伪造文件
story about needing forged papers to get back to India.

598
00:32:04,538 --> 00:32:05,883
我听着呢 Finch
I'm waiting, Finch.

599
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:07,551
你说啥呢 等啥
What are you talking about? Waiting for what?

600
00:32:07,586 --> 00:32:08,962
那家伙可是个专业人士
That was pro bono.

601
00:32:09,082 --> 00:32:11,260
我还漂亮吗
Do I still look good or not?

602
00:32:12,604 --> 00:32:13,555
我之前说谎了
I lied before.

603
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:16,630
你看起来还是很漂亮
You still look good.

604
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,200
你想要啥
What do you want?

605
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,920
你有一群笨蛋带着枪
You got a lot of meatheads carrying guns,

606
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,590
但没人能帮你重建你整个组织
but you don't have anybody that can restructure

607
00:32:22,637 --> 00:32:25,847
让它合法 那 Talita
your entire organization and make it legit. That, Talita,

608
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,480
就是我想要的
is what I want.

609
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,920
还是以前的价格吗
Still billing the same rate?

610
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:30,978
不 不 现在是大人物规则了
No, no. Big boy rules now.

611
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,981
不再收律师费了 我要抽成
No more retainers. I need a percentage.

612
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:34,212
大人物规则
"Big boy rules"?

613
00:32:34,712 --> 00:32:35,144
是
Yeah.

614
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:36,333
我喜欢
I like that.

615
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,521
- 小心我的西装  - 起来
- Easy on the suit.  - Get up.

616
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,529
你知道 我不喜欢你09年时不守诺言
You see, I don't like the one-and-done thing

617
00:32:48,585 --> 00:32:50,380
打一枪就跑
that you pulled back in '09.

618
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,308
把事情搞定
Make things right.

619
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:54,430
跟我表表衷心
Show me you're loyal.

620
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:56,513
你指的是啥
What are you talking about?

621
00:32:57,095 --> 00:33:00,455
在大人物的桌旁有你的位置
There's a seat for you at my big boy table.

622
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:02,796
但你得去争取
But you got to take it.

623
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:04,555
带他去
Show him.

624
00:33:21,768 --> 00:33:22,838
你线人说得对
Your source was right.

625
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:25,586
这家伙一出现
This guy showed up,

626
00:33:25,626 --> 00:33:27,707
说他急需一个身份证
said he needed clean I.D. Fast.

627
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:29,647
但是如果他是个警察
But if he's a cop,

628
00:33:30,224 --> 00:33:31,801
为什么 当我们搜遍了他全身
how come, when we shook him down,

629
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,871
只发现一个U盘
all we found was a thumb drive?

630
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,453
我不知道什么U盘
I don't know anything about a thumb drive.

631
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,220
现在我拥有U盘了
Now that I have it,

632
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,584
我不需要他了 是吧
I don't need him, do I?

633
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,544
证明你的忠诚
Prove your loyalty.

634
00:33:47,768 --> 00:33:48,514
拿着
Take it.

635
00:33:54,648 --> 00:33:55,887
小个子忘记了
Little man here forgot

636
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,202
在小偷之间是没有荣誉可言的
there's no honor among thieves.

637
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:04,847
他有段时间没消息了
He's been dark for a while.

638
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,874
我们知道里面有问题
We knew this building had problems.

639
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:12,389
- 听着 Talita 我不杀人的  - 也许不是为了生存
- Listen, Talita, I don't shoot people. Maybe not for a living,

640
00:34:12,431 --> 00:34:15,831
不过任何人都可以在一个受了伤的人面前开枪的
but anyone can stand before a beaten man and pull a trigger.

641
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,050
我只放了一个子弹在那枪里
I only put one bullet in that gun.

642
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:21,624
别打歪了
Don't miss.

643
00:34:23,915 --> 00:34:25,343
要么现在 Finch
Now, Finch,

644
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:29,742
要么我们就会有两具尸体挂在这些吊钩上了
or we're going to have two bodies hanging from hooks.

645
00:35:04,707 --> 00:35:05,063
Eric
Eric?

646
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:06,646
信号已经是最大限度增幅了
The signal's on full boost.

647
00:35:06,682 --> 00:35:07,604
我们啥都不能做
There's nothing we can do.

648
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:09,085
在那地方
Lots of guns

649
00:35:09,138 --> 00:35:10,077
有好多枪
inside that place.

650
00:35:10,886 --> 00:35:11,358
我们进去
We go in,

651
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,308
我们就会遭遇强火力
we're going in big.

652
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,448
我们再等一分钟
Let's let it play out for another 60 seconds,

653
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:15,647
然后我们攻入
then we breach.

654
00:35:17,076 --> 00:35:17,541
明白
We clear?

655
00:35:19,913 --> 00:35:20,511
Kensi
Kensi?

656
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:28,445
Kensi
Kensi...!

657
00:35:28,818 --> 00:35:31,225
妹的 Eric 告诉洛杉矶警方我们要行动了
Damn it. Eric, tell LAPD we're going in hot.

658
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,880
收到
Copy that.

659
00:35:33,502 --> 00:35:33,987
Kensi
Kensi!

660
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:44,112
放下枪 联邦探员
Drop it! Federal agent!

661
00:35:49,003 --> 00:35:49,440
Deeks
Deeks!

662
00:36:04,308 --> 00:36:05,223
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

663
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,580
你差点打爆我的头
You almost took my head off.

664
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,690
谁开的那枪
Who takes that shot?

665
00:36:08,115 --> 00:36:09,199
你怎么现在才来
Took you long enough.

666
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,120
Thapa 跟我走
Stay with me, Thapa.

667
00:36:19,994 --> 00:36:21,271
我向你们道歉
I owe you guys an apology.

668
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:22,932
对不起
I'm sorry.

669
00:36:23,446 --> 00:36:24,551
告诉我你拿到了那个U盘
Tell me you secured the thumb drive,

670
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,705
我们会忘了这事儿
we're going to forget about it.

671
00:36:26,212 --> 00:36:26,851
我没拿
I don't have it.

672
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,209
谁拿了 Deeks
Well, who has it-- Deeks?

673
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:30,278
呃 没有
Um, no.

674
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:31,799
我的意思是 他要是拿了他就会说了 是吧
I mean, he would have said if he had it, right?

675
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:32,320
但我
But I...

676
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:34,483
好吧 肯定不可能是廓尔喀人拿着U盘
Okay, there's no way the Gurkha held onto it,

677
00:36:34,504 --> 00:36:36,517
所以是在这儿的某个地方 我 我会找到的
so it's got to be here somewhere. I-I will find it.

678
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,115
我猜是在夹克的衣袋里
I'm thinking inside jacket pocket,

679
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,776
左边
left side.

680
00:36:44,544 --> 00:36:45,240
我猜是右边
I'll go right.

681
00:36:54,018 --> 00:36:54,567
找到了
Bingo.

682
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:55,873
猜得好
Nice call.

683
00:36:59,012 --> 00:37:02,744
Kensi 道歉接受了
Kensi... apology accepted.

684
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:06,122
去和你搭档汇合吧
Go be with your partner.

685
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:07,241
谢谢
Thanks.

686
00:37:12,535 --> 00:37:13,795
这件事带来了一大堆麻烦
Lot of trouble over this thing.

687
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,421
你对了
That's right,

688
00:37:14,435 --> 00:37:15,308
所以我们得把它放在安全的地方
so let's put it somewhere safe.

689
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:16,533
你知道吗
You know what?

690
00:37:16,955 --> 00:37:18,145
这主意太好了
That's a good idea.

691
00:37:19,543 --> 00:37:20,704
安全为上 G
Watch my back, G.

692
00:37:23,738 --> 00:37:24,491
预备 抬
Here we go.

693
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:33,283
他流了不少血 但是会活下来的
He lost a lot of blood but he'll live.

694
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,182
廓尔喀人的流言 绝不夸张
Gurkhas, believe the hype.

695
00:37:37,108 --> 00:37:37,460
Deeks
Deeks...

696
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:39,226
我准备跟他去医院
