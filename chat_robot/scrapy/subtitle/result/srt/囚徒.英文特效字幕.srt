{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,why don't you rent out grandpa's old apartment house?

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the deer,if they have too many babies,

93
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,520

00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not tryin' to tell you you're doing anything bad.

325
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just tryin' to get the right answers out of you,okay?

326
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The real ones. That's all I want.

327
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do you usually park your rv,Alex?

328
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My aunt's house. Your aunt's house?

329
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She lets me park it in the backyard.

330
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The grass don't grow back there anyway.

331
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was my husband's.

332
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For sale,if you want it.

333
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,thanks.

334
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,would you tell me

335
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what you're doin' on my property then?

336
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just glad to know where he is.

337
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:40,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's always home before dark,and...

338
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just don't understand.

339
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That boy has never been in trouble,

340
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}not a day in his life.

341
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh,in the summertime,

342
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he sleeps out in the camper some,but...

343
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This time of year,he sleeps in here on the sofa bed.

344
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my husband.

345
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We had a fight,jeez,five years ago.

346
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:17,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walked out,didn't come back.

347
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alex loved him like a father.

348
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are Alex's real parents?

349
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My husband's brother and his girlfriend,

350
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they died in a car accident when Alex was about 6.

351
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry to hear that.

352
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't have much.

353
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have you got?

354
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,this thing's clean.

355
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean,it's filthy as shit,but we didn't find anything.

356
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We didn't find any,uh,wool fibers,anything like that?

357
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The girls could be wearing some wool gloves or wool hat.

358
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No cotton fibers?

359
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,if he was just usin' this thing to transport 'em,

360
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I might buy that.

361
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if there had been a struggle,

362
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would have found something.

363
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd start lookin' in the woods by the rest stop.

364
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

365
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Half the uniformed cops in the state

366
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are doin' that right now.

367
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When you're done with this thing,

368
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}can you send a crew over to the aunt's house?

369
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anna!

370
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anna?!

371
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for comin'. Franklin birch.

372
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My wife's in here.

373
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey?

374
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her name's Nancy.

375
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Detective Loki is...honey?

376
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These photos are better than the ones my husband gave you.

377
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can see her eyes more clearly.

378
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So,did we pass?

379
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry,what did you say?

380
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The poly thing.

381
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The lie detector we took this morning.

382
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did we pass?

383
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,yeah,yeah. Sorry.

384
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,we appreciate your cooperation.

385
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's embarrassing,all the...all this fuss.

386
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone's gonna think we're crazy

387
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when those two come out of hiding,wherever they are.

388
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:50,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have some reason to believe they ran away?

389
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

390
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're happy.

391
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They must have run away.

392
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think they must have run away.

393
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right?

394
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um,your police captain told me

395
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you've solved every case that you've ever been assigned.

396
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that right?

397
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

398
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am so sorry.

399
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you... do you have children,detective?

400
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna find your daughter.

401
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We believe that they came back here

402
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}after they left you at the birches' yesterday.

403
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were looking for Anna's red whistle.

404
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right.

405
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I read your statement.

406
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm detective Loki.

407
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm heading up the investigation

408
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}into your daughter's disappearance.

409
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please sit down.

410
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh,uh,m-my son already told you

411
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that the guy was inside the RV just watchin' 'em,right?

412
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We haven't found any physical evidence inside the RV.

413
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or his aunt's house where he lives.

414
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing?

415
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alex Jones unfortunately has the I.Q. Of a 10-year-old.

416
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is no way that someone with the I.Q. Of a 10-year-old

417
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}could abduct two girls in broad daylight and then...

418
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Somehow make them disappear.

419
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh,well,how can he drive an rv?

420
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If he can't answer a question...

421
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,he has a legal Pennsylvania license.

422
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he ran,right? They said he tried to run away.

423
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why... why... Why would he run?

424
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've just spent 10 hours questioning this boy. Okay?

425
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hear what you're saying.

426
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh... Did... did you give him a lie detector?

427
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gave us a lie detector. Did you give him one?

428
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir,I understand what you're asking me. Yes,we did.

429
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We gave him a lie detector,and there is no way of...

430
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A lie detector doesn't work

431
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you don't understand the questions.

432
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,maybe he wasn't on his own.

433
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could he drive an rv

434
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if he has an I.Q. of a 10-year-old?

435
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,we're considering all possibilities.

436
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think you are considering all possibilities.

437
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I-I hear what you're saying. Sir... sir...you listen to me.

439
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is what I'm gonna need you to do for me.

440
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you to calm down.

441
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

442
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please listen to me for a second.

443
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:37,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Dover,I understand this is an incredibly hard time.

444
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I have every uniformed police officer in this state

445
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}looking for Anna.

446
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand what any of this means.

447
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They said he ran.

448
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They said he tried to get away.

449
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand why he would try to run away.

450
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're considering all possibilities,Mr. Dover.

451
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hear what you're saying.

452
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not crossing anybody off my list.

453
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just... Let me do my job.

457
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He stays in custody until my daughter's found,right?

458
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right?

459
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a 48-hour hold on him

460
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that ends tomorrow unless we bring charges.

461
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,charge him with something. Charge him.

462
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Dover,I understand what you're...

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you've got to break to keep that asshole in custody.

466
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,I know you can't promise me anything.

467
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand that.

468
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I'm asking you to be 100% sure.

471
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you're positive he's innocent,

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a free man,I'm a free man!

535
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Tell me what you did with them!

536
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me!

537
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They didn't cry until I left them.

538
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you say? What did you say?!

539
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa,no,no!

540
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuckin' get off!

541
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God! Get up!

542
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get him down! Get him down!

543
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move back!

544
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please,just let us go.

545
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're fine. Thank you.

546
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:17,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,I know your dad was a guard at Graterford.

547
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I've got a daughter of my own,

548
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so we're gonna pretend this never happened.

549
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And as for Alex Jones,

550
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he has orders not to leave the commonwealth.

551
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

552
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir,I need you to go home. All right?

553
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you to go home to your family.

554
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,460


555
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why aren't you sending someone out to go arrest this guy?

556
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell detective Loki what you just told me,

557
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he'll definitely look into it.

558
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead.

559
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That asshole you promised me you'd keep in custody,right?

560
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you didn't.

561
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And right now when I grabbed him in the parking lot,

562
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he said right to my fucking face,

563
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"they didn't cry until I left them."

564
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right to my fucking face.

565
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He... he said that to you in the parking lot just now?

566
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right now,yeah. What did I just say?

567
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the parking lot.

568
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before you grabbed me off him.

569
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did anyone else hear it besides you?

570
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. It was quiet.

571
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He... he said it to me. He wanted me to know.

572
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure he said that? What?

573
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure that's what he said?

574
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jesus Christ,you think I'm makin' this up?

575
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Why would I make this up?

576
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,hey,hey,whoa,whoa. No,think about it.

577
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would I make this up? I'm not saying that to you.

578
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just asking you a couple questions.

579
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will talk to him.

580
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,don't talk to him! Mr. Dover...

581
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}arrest him!

582
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did I fuckin' tell you?

583
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:38,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What'd I tell you? One more day.

584
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure you didn't say anything to Mr. Dover

585
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the parking lot today?

586
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything he could have misinterpreted or...?

587
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was right there.

588
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They didn't say anything to each other.

589
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man just attacked the boy.

590
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing like "get away from me" or "help" or...

591
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anything like that?

592
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:05,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

593
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I speak to Alex alone for a minute?

594
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all right,sweetie.

595
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be right in the next room.

596
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:31,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You love your aunt,don't you,Alex?

597
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

598
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know if you know something you're not telling us

599
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that she could go to jail for a very long time.

600
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:47,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you want that for her?

601
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After everything she's done for you?

602
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

603
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Dover,this is detective Loki.

604
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you arrested him?

605
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,look,I just came from Alex Jones,

606
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and he said he didn't say anything to you

607
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the parking lot.

608
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I pushed him pretty hard,and he didn't budge.

609
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So,look,we can't waste any more time on this guy.

610
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right? You're gonna have to trust me.

611
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll let you know if I have anything new,all right,

612
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for the...

613
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:29,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuckin' A

614
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:46,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The zipper on her coat was broken,

615
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I told her it didn't matter

616
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'cause we were just gonna go right down the street.

617
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,no.

618
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why hasn't she come home?

619
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been three days.

620
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:59,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why can't you make her come home?

621
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand.

622
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't understand. It's been too long.

623
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:10,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please make her come home.

624
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please make her...

625
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many of these? How many of these?

626
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many of these? I don't know!

627
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. It's all right.

628
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:21,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just take one.

629
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here.

630
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

631
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want to sleep.

632
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:31,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want to go to sleep.

633
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You...

634
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:39,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You made me feel so safe.

635
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:48,980


636
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,God...

637
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna go out and help the police.

638
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just keep an eye on your mother.

639
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your sister needs us to be brave for her.

640
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be brave for her.Be a grown-up for me,okay?

641
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you do that?

642
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you do that?

643
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you're scared. Look at me. Come here.

644
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you're scared.

645
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna be okay.

646
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:35,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The former is a reason why we should be very patient.

647
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The latter why we should be very penitent

648
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when we are afflicted.

649
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:44,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He reminds him that trouble and affliction

650
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:48,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are what we have all reason to expect in this world.

651
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:51,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man is brought into trouble,not as man,

652
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but as sinful man,who was in transgression.

653
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man born in sin and therefore born to trouble.

654
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

655
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:48,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,Tucker.

656
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jingle bells,Batman smells

657
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robin laid an egg

658
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:57,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Batmobile lost its wheels

659
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:00,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}joker got away,hey

660
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:06,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}jingle bells,Batman smells,Robin laid an egg

661
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jingle bells,Batman smells

662
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robin laid an egg

663
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Batmobile... -Alex.

664
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:23,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lost its wheel...

665
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That song.

666
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you hear those words?

667
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm?

668
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:57,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you bring a change of clothes like I told you?

669
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.You gonna tell me why?

670
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's better if I just show you.

671
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Show me what?

672
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't you used to live here?

673
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Close the door.Lock it.

674
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:29,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,my God.What... what did you do?

675
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keller,what the hell...?

676
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:32,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I heard him singing the same song

677
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they were singing on Thanksgiving.

678
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:36,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Swear to God,Franklin. The same fucking song.

679
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I told you what he said in the parking lot.

680
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we take him to the police...

681
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:42,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}no,no,no.The police won't do shit.

682
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll just clam up and act crazy like he did last time.

683
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone has to make him talk.

684
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:48,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone.

685
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit,man.This... this ain't right.

686
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean,what if you're wrong?

687
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not wrong. But what if you are?

688
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if you only heard what you wanted to hear?

689
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if...

690
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:06,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man,I want my daughter back as much as you do,

691
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but it ain't right. Franklin! Franklin!

692
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:13,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We hurt him until he talks,or they're gonna die.

693
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:15,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This ain't...

694
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:18,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No!

695
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:21,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We hurt him until he talks or they're gonna die.

696
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:25,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the choice.

697
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:28,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the choice you have to make.

698
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've made my choice.

699
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know what I heard.

700
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:39,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not a person anymore.

701
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,he stopped being a person when he took our daughters.

702
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need your help.

703
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is your last chance.I know you're scared.

704
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I know you wanna go home.

705
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I don't...I don't want to hurt you.

706
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't.

707
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna take the tape off,

708
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I want you to tell me where they are.

709
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Come on.

710
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:20,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you see my glasses?

711
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:21,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

712
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't see.

713
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:27,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're not gonna talk,Alex,I'm gonna have to hurt you.

714
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me where they are.

715
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are they?

716
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me where they are!

717
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:38,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,I'm out here at a house on Fairmont circle,

718
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the house the rv was parked in front of.

719
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's only been on the market a couple of months.

720
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:44,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna track the owners down,see if they know anything.

721
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got any new info on that corpse

722
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we found in the priest's basement?

723
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:50,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No DNA,dental,or fingerprint matches.

724
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing.

725
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:54,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Priest is sticking to the story,too.

726
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:57,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

727
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Same person who took him took those girls.

728
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure of it.

729
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:39,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wearing out the tape,I guess.

730
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:41,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I watch it every day after breakfast.

731
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:44,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the only video I have of him.

732
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was before your time.

733
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}26 years ago,August 19th.

734
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I took a nap in the afternoon,

735
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:58,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and when I woke up,Barry was gone.

736
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:01,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one could ever tell me what happened to him.

737
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:05,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was playing in the front yard,

738
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:10,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just a few feet from where they say that rv was parked.

739
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you think that means?

740
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:20,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm more interested in what you think that means.

741
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think we'll ever know.

742
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just like Barry.

743
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:31,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one took them.

744
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:34,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing happened.

745
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're just gone.

746
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:50,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How you doin',father?

747
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm... I'm...gettin' better.

748
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:56,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So detective Chemelinski tells me

749
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you have some specifics

750
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}about the crime you claim that guy committed.

751
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:03,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The abductor.

752
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was...

753
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:10,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Waging a war against God.

754
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:17,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great.That's great.

755
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you said he had something specific.

756
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:25,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell him how he took the kids.

757
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,750

759
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:37,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes...

760
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}More than one child at a time.

00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:43,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said that?

762

764
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:49,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He did it alone?

797
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:32,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're doing this to yourself.

798

804
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Four days have passed

807
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The two girls,aged 6 and 7,

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are believed to have been playing on this street

809
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when they disappeared without a trace.

810
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As you can see,despite the cold,

811

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a lot of people have turned out tonight to show their support.

812
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:31,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Police are asking that anyone

813
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with any information on the girls' whereabouts...

814
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:48,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where have you been?

815
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:51,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was searching for her in the woods.

816
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm okay. I'm okay.

817
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Franklin.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Franklin,what is it?

819
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:19,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just need a minute.

820
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck?

821

825
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the investigation of the two missing girls.

826
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now,this unidentified man,

827
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:38,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who was last seen at last night's candlelight vigil,

828
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}fled on foot when the investigating detective

829
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}attempted to question him.

830
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:45,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Police caution the public not to approach this man,

831
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:47,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but to call police immediately if they do see him.

832
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:50,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks,John,for that update.

833
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:53,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And now for the weather.

834
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:55,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should expect heavy rain into the weekend and...

835
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look,Keller,I mean,just think about it.

836
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:09,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would the police be lookin' for this man

837
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:12,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if they didn't think that he did it in the first place?

838
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They did it together.They know each other.

839
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen,I fuckin' told you,all right?

840
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:18,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jones looked me in the eye and he said,

841
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:20,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"they only cried when I left them."

842
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He left 'em with someone,and he knows where this guy is.

843
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:31,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Holly Jones' dog got hit on southward street.

844
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:33,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apparently Alex Jones took the dog for a walk

845
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:35,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the night before last...they never came home.

846
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:36,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And his aunt didn't want to tell us about the dog

847
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:38,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when we called her about it this morning.

848
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said that she thought

849
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it would get him into trouble or some shit.

850
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you said you would keep him under surveillance.

851
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:45,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,and I thought you said the guy was innocent.

852
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:48,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I thought the guy from last night you said was our guy.

853
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:49,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look,I don't have money in the budget

854
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for watching innocent people.

855
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said to me that you'd put him under surveillance.

856
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:54,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want me to say? You gonna keep your word?

857
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You could have just given me a call,because I would have

858
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:57,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}been there all night. I would have stayed up all night.

859
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would know where he was now.

860
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to know where everybody is.

861
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right,point made. All right? Point made.

862
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:05,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you can be clear with me,then I'll be clear with you.

863
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to know where everybody is.

864
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:09,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you're gonna do something different,please tell me.

865
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:12,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me about your RV.

866
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you do in your RV?

867
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's where I go...

868
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:19,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To be alone.

869
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:28,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What music do you listen to in your RV when you're alone?

870
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:31,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Radio,tape...

871
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:39,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The RV was parked over on Fairmont circle?

872
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:41,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

873
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is my aunt coming?

874
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:51,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you seen these girls?

875
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

876
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:56,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take a look at 'em.You seen these girls?

877
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:00,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

878
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:02,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you participate in any way

879
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:05,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the abduction of those girls?

880
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

881
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:10,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Loki! You got a call.

882
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

883
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I called as soon as I saw the sketch on TV.

884
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He comes in here every week almost

885
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and buys kids' clothes,

886
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:24,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but he's always buying stuff in different sizes.

887
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Caught him messing around with the mannequins once.

888
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:29,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did he pay with?

889
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cash.

890
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:34,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right,you give me a call if you hear anything.

891
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay.

892
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:41,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been five days.

893
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:45,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe five days since they had a drink of water.

894
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This could be the last night that matters.

895
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:57,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look,I'll call you after Nancy goes to sleep,all right?

896
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:58,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise.

897
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where have you been all this time?

898
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the hell were you thinking?

899
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You tell anyone?

900
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you?

901
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wanna see him.

902
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:35,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please help me.

903
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:42,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you help me find my little girl?

904
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got a picture.

905
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:49,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See?

906
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:53,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This my baby.

907
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see her?

908
01:05:55,850 --> 01:06:00,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her name is joy.

909
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:06,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And,um...

910
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:08,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is...

911
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:11,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A stuffed animal we got her when she was 2

912
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:13,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}because she's afraid to sleep by herself.

913
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please... Tell me where my little girl is.

914
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:20,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please tell me where my little girl...

915
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you're gonna tell me.

916
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:29,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you're gonna tell me.

917
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:31,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

918
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help me.

919
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help me.

920
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:58,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Franklin,did you close the door to the...

921
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:00,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nancy!

922
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:05,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What the fuck you doin'?

923
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God damn it!Damn!

924
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:12,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let it go!

925
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let it go!

926
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:21,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You untied him? Huh?

927
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:35,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was close.

928
01:08:17,190 --> 01:08:18,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is it? What happened?

929
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:21,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get Franklin.I need to show you something.

930
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:26,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did he say anything new?

931
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:29,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He will soon.You'll see.

932
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:43,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No light gets in.

933
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:46,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's barely enough room to sit down inside.

934
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:47,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shower still works,

935
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but we control it from out here.

936
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:51,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I rigged the water heater

937
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:55,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so it either comes out scalding or freezing.

938
01:08:57,130 --> 01:09:00,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And,uh,you talk to him through this.

939
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:02,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's to remind us...

940
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In case we start feeling sorry for him.

941
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:09,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My God.

942
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:12,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't hurt him any more without killing him,

943
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so this is the only way.

944
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:16,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you lost your mind,Keller?

945
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:19,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have a better idea,Franklin?

946
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:22,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you?

947
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:25,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go ahead.Let him out,if you want.

948
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:26,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not gonna stop you.

949
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:30,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If that's what you really want,you go ahead.

950
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think someone's lookin' out for our girls

951
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the way you're lookin' out for him?

952
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:38,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope.

953
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:43,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been five days now,man.We're runnin' out of time.

954
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't even know it's him.

955
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,I do. No,you don't.

956
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:51,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do. I know you. You don't.

957
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:55,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look,I want my baby back...

958
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:58,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As much as you miss Anna.

959
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:01,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And despite what you think about me,

960
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would die for my daughter.

961
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this ain't right.

962
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This has to stop.

963
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:14,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,then,you better get to work.

964
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:20,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can start with that wall there.

965
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:40,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Franklin.

966
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:43,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop.

967
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:51,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Franklin...

968
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:53,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think of joy.

969
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:36,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to get out of this place,Ralph.

970
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:40,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything in this house just makes me want to throw up.

971
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:44,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your dad's building?

972
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:48,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There is no way I'm staying in that crackhouse.

973
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's disgusting.

974
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,okay.

975
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:22,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not gonna help Keller,but we won't stop him,either.

976
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:24,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let him do what he needs to.

977
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:33,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't know about it anymore.

978
01:12:57,870 --> 01:12:59,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eliza?

979
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eliza?

980
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:10,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me.Eliza?

981
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:15,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eliza,open the door!

982
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:16,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eliza?

983
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:18,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is she in there?

984
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey?

985
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:22,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of the way!Get out of the way!

986
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:23,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,fuck you both!

987
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:25,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next time you plan on leaving me here alone,

988
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}maybe you could try at least telling me where you're going!

989
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ralph?

990
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anna?

991
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anna?

992
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:48,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anna?

993
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:53,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anna?

994
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:06,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anna?

995
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:10,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom?

996
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:15,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom?

997
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:16,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anna.Anna was here.

998
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:18,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom,it's freezing in here.

999
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:20,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom! Hey,mom,mom,mom,please sit down.

1000
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop. Calm down.I'm gonna close the window.

1001
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:28,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she wasn't here.

1002
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:31,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then I heard a sound from my room,

1003
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:35,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I... I came in and the window was open.

1004
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:38,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And... and it wasn't open before.

1005
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:43,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then... and then Ralph,he... he came in...

1006
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he looked and... and,um...

1007
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:50,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then...

1008
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I don't know.

1009
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:56,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aren't you gonna write this down?

1010
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:11,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The basement.

1011
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:13,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't check the basement. We need to check the basement.

1012
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:15,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I-I'll show you. I'll show you.

1013
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The kids know they're not allowed down here.

1014
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're not supposed to come down here,

1015
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:38,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I-I don't know.

1016
01:16:55,500 --> 01:17:00,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My husband likes to be prepared for emergencies.

1017
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:07,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is your husband,Mrs. Dover?

1018
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:09,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was gonna ask you.

1019
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:13,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's been out searching with the police for Anna.

1020
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:16,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which you should be doing right now.

1021
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:19,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does he always stay out this late?

1022
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:21,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes,he stays out this late

1023
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:23,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when he's looking for my daughter,

1024
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}since my daughter has been gone... yes!

1025
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

1026
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,go aro...

1027
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}go around.

1028
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:08,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fuck.

1029
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:56,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,Mr. Dover.

1030
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

1031
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:21,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you following me?

1032
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in the car.

1033
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you following me?

1034
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:44,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you go just now?

1035
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:46,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I parked at a liquor store.

1036
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have a bottle of liquor.

1037
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:51,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the shit-hot detective.Work it out.

1038
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:53,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I actually meant before that.

1039
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:58,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were walking in the opposite direction

1040
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:00,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}across the parking lot.

1041
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Towards campello street.

1042
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:13,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,well... I haven't had a drink

1043
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in nine-and-a-half years.

1044
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:17,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I figured if I walked around the parking lot for a while,

1045
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:20,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}by the time they opened,I'd stop wanting it that bad.

1046
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then... then I saw you.

1047
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:25,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorta helped me make up my mind.

1048
01:21:31,210 --> 01:21:35,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a bag of lye in your basement that's half-empty.

1049
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:43,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your wife thinks you've been helpin' us...

1050
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:46,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we both know that's not true.

1051
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:49,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used the lye to bury our dog last year.

1052
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:51,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And "helping the cops" sounds better

1053
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:53,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}than "I've been driving aimlessly in my truck

1054
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'cause I don't know what the fuck else to do."

1055
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:58,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that what you were doing last Saturday night?

1056
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:01,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably.Am I a suspect?

1057
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:03,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No,I'm only asking

1058
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:05,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm only asking 'cause you assaulted a man who's now missing.

1059
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:10,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I heard about that.What happened to him?

1060
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thought you had him under surveillance.

1061
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:14,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna assume you're asking me because you have no idea.

1062
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,I didn't think it was something I could get away with.

1063
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:18,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not.

1064
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:20,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,well,it couldn't be that he skipped town

1065
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'cause the asshole is guilty. Couldn't be that,right?

1066
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause that would mean it would be your fault,right?

1067
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Dover?

1068
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:31,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr. Dover? What?

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what's completely fucked up about all this

1282
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:56,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is I know you know where they are.

1283
01:46:58,510 --> 01:47:01,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think we're done.

1284
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:11,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're in the maze.

1285
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:13,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's where you'll find them.

1286
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:15,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1287
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:18,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you say?

1288
01:47:20,630 --> 01:47:22,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the maze.

1289
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:24,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What... what... maze?

1290
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:26,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is it?Where is the maze?

1291
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do I find it?

1292
01:47:28,270 --> 01:47:30,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alex?

1293
01:47:30,970 --> 01:47:32,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alex,Alex,listen to me.

1294
01:47:32,470 --> 01:47:34,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna get you out of here,okay?

1295
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:36,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just tell me where the maze is.

1296
01:47:36,710 --> 01:47:39,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's it.Just tell me,man.

1297
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:42,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is the maze?

1298
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,tell me.

1299
01:47:44,950 --> 01:47:47,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just tell me where the maze is,okay?

1300
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:51,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,don't fuck with me.

1301
01:47:51,660 --> 01:47:53,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't fuck with me now.

1302
01:47:53,830 --> 01:47:55,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me,God damn it!

1303
01:47:55,660 --> 01:47:56,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me where they are!

1304
01:47:56,970 --> 01:48:00,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!

1305
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something's gonna get to you,man.

1306
01:48:04,910 --> 01:48:07,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something's gonna get to you!

1307
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:09,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something's gonna get to you!

1308
01:48:31,870 --> 01:48:33,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a minute!

1309
01:48:35,740 --> 01:48:37,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I help you?

1310
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:38,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Morning,ma'am.

1311
01:48:38,740 --> 01:48:41,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um... I'm Keller Dover.

1312
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:46,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh,my little girl was abducted with a friend.

1313
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:50,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want?

1314
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:52,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh...

1315
01:48:55,690 --> 01:48:58,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I-I guess I haven't thought this through too good,huh?

1316
01:48:58,390 --> 01:49:00,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I...

1317
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:04,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been thinkin' a lot about what happened to your nephew.

1318
01:49:04,430 --> 01:49:06,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I know I scared him

1319
01:49:06,870 --> 01:49:09,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the other day at the police station,and... and...

1320
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:10,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I'm tryin' to say is

1321
01:49:10,970 --> 01:49:14,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I kind of feel responsible for him running away.

1322
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:18,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wanna come on in?

1323
01:49:18,650 --> 01:49:20,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1324
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:33,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My husband and I were...

1325
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:36,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very devout at one time.

1326
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:39,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spent our summers driving around

1327
01:49:39,670 --> 01:49:42,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in that camper with our son...

1328
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:45,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Handin' out pamphlets...

1329
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:49,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spreadin' the good word.

1330
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:54,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After our son died of cancer...

1331
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:58,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We started seein' things differently.

1332
01:49:58,620 --> 01:50:01,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Adopting Alex helped...

1333
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:04,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we never got over it.

1334
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:08,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

1335
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:12,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You look very tired.

1336
01:50:12,470 --> 01:50:17,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,I don't sleep much.

1337
01:50:17,010 --> 01:50:20,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I,uh...

1338
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:24,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I keep dreaming about being lost in a maze.

1339
01:50:27,450 --> 01:50:30,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

1340
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:33,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alex never talks very much,so...

1341
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:36,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When people come over here,I hardly know what to say.

1342
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:38,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't talk much?

1343
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:39,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,he talks,you know.

1344
01:50:39,730 --> 01:50:42,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Good morning," "good night"...that sort of thing.

1345
01:50:42,130 --> 01:50:44,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hard to get too much more than that out of him.

1346
01:50:44,630 --> 01:50:47,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He had an accident when he was little.

1347
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:49,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After that,he started

1348
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:51,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}choosing his words a little too carefully.

1349
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:54,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What,uh,what kind of accident did he...

1350
01:50:54,540 --> 01:50:57,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh.

1351
01:50:57,050 --> 01:50:58,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My husband kept snakes.

1352
01:50:58,750 --> 01:51:01,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It wasn't that bad what happened,

1353
01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:03,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but Alex had a fear of them and...

1354
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:06,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not my favorite memory.

1355
01:51:06,220 --> 01:51:09,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. It's none...none of my business.

1356
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:11,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,it's...

1357
01:51:14,530 --> 01:51:17,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I get you a cup of tea,Mr. Dover?

1358
01:51:23,170 --> 01:51:24,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh.

1359
01:51:24,410 --> 01:51:25,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,I'm so sorry.

1360
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:28,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you had known about that already.

1361
01:51:28,110 --> 01:51:30,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I say it's better this way.

1362
01:51:30,110 --> 01:51:32,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know,that awful man,

1363
01:51:32,050 --> 01:51:34,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}he would have spent years on death row

1364
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:37,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}just watchin' TV and gettin' fat.

1365
01:51:40,550 --> 01:51:45,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,least I don't have to worry about losing you to PSP.

1366
01:51:52,630 --> 01:51:55,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When forensics is finished with the guy's place,

1367
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:57,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we're gonna deploy the cadaver dogs.

1368
01:51:57,640 --> 01:52:01,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look,kid,we can't always save the day.

1369
01:52:01,710 --> 01:52:05,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right? We're just cops,janitors.

1370
01:52:05,550 --> 01:52:09,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you lost this one,all right?

1371
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:12,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look,you want fulfillment,you need to find a girl,

1372
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you know,start a family,have some kids.

1373
01:52:14,660 --> 01:52:16,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let it go.

1374
01:53:45,650 --> 01:53:47,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah?

1375
01:53:47,050 --> 01:53:51,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,it's Rich.We found somethin'.

1376
01:53:51,490 --> 01:53:54,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Guys,let us have a look.

1377
01:53:59,530 --> 01:54:01,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two kid-sized department store mannequins,

1378
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:03,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}with their heads caved in.

1379
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:05,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just talked to our lab guys,

1380
01:54:05,430 --> 01:54:07,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and they told me that all the blood that we sampled

1381
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:10,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}from the plastic containers pig's blood.

1382
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:12,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right,you guys,let's get this covered up.

1383
01:54:12,610 --> 01:54:14,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's supposed to snow soon.Hurry up,okay?

1384
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:19,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's like he's play-acting.

1385
01:54:19,210 --> 01:54:21,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean,case in point.

1386
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:23,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Except for the few items I.D.'d by the Dovers and the Birches,

1387
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:24,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}all the kids' clothes that we found

1388
01:54:24,850 --> 01:54:26,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}still had the tags on them.

1389
01:54:26,350 --> 01:54:28,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that maze book that we found,he made it.

1390
01:54:28,420 --> 01:54:30,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Photocopies,pictures from this book

1391
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:31,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that we found in the attic.

1392
01:54:31,630 --> 01:54:33,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ex-F.B.I. Agent wrote that.

1393
01:54:33,630 --> 01:54:36,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Finding the Invisible Man."

1394
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:38,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,it's about a theoretical suspect that he believed

1395
01:54:38,530 --> 01:54:40,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was responsible for a bunch of child abductions.

1396
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:42,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's totally discredited,I guess,

1397
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:43,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I read some of it.

1398
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:45,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taylor... Taylor was abducted when he was a kid.

1399
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:46,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He ran away after three weeks.

1400
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:47,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And the captor drugged him

1401
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:49,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on some sort of LSD/Ketamine cocktail.

1402
01:54:49,910 --> 01:54:52,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He never remembered. They never caught the guy.

1403
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:54,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay,so...

1404
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:55,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He read the book

1405
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:57,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and decided he was taken by the invisible man.

1406
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now he's doing his best imitation,right?

1407
01:55:02,590 --> 01:55:05,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah,he was doing his best imitation.

1408
01:55:05,330 --> 01:55:07,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He killed himself last night.

1409
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:10,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did he do that? I thought he was in custody.

1410
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:17,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

1411
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:19,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Taylor drew this.

1412
01:55:19,810 --> 01:55:21,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a map to the bodies.

1413
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:23,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we found the same design on a pendant

1414
01:55:23,010 --> 01:55:25,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that we pulled off that corpse the other day.

1415
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:27,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a connection. Okay?

1416
01:55:27,010 --> 01:55:30,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The connection is that it's the last maze in the book.

1417
01:55:30,250 --> 01:55:33,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did it. It's unsolvable.There's no way out.

1418
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:35,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your corpse is another wannabe who read the book.

1419
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:37,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you saying to me,Rich?

1420
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:39,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you saying to me? What are you saying?

1421
01:55:39,430 --> 01:55:41,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That... that...that this guy is a fake?

1422
01:55:41,130 --> 01:55:42,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're saying that the girls...

1423
01:55:42,530 --> 01:55:44,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the girls are still out there somewhere?

1424
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:45,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did Bob Taylor get those clothes?

1425
01:55:45,870 --> 01:55:47,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did... how did the parents...

1426
01:55:47,770 --> 01:55:51,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Positively I.D.Those clothes?!

1427
01:55:51,170 --> 01:55:55,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That I can't reconcile.

1428
01:55:55,710 --> 01:55:57,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't reconcile that?

1429
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:59,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just keep knockin' on doors,look in the windows.

1430
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:02,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey,why is that there? Bag that.

1431
01:56:02,450 --> 01:56:03,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will do,sir. Right away.

1432
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:33,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes?

1433
01:57:35,380 --> 01:57:39,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um,yeah. This is she.

1434
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:44,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

1435
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:47,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh,my God!

1436
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:51,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh,wait. Is she...?

1437
01:57:51,290 --> 01:57:54,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ralph! Keller!

1438
01:58:10,110 --> 01:58:12,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keller! We need to go to the hospital!

1439
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:14,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They found joy,but not Anna! What?

1440
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:15,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They didn't find Anna!

1441
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:18,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe she'll know where Anna is! Please,we have to go!

1442
01:58:18,450 --> 01:58:20,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keller!

1443
01:58:22,790 --> 01:58:25,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eliza's not picking up.

1444
01:58:25,490 --> 01:58:27,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You should text her.

1445
01:58:27,190 --> 01:58:30,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

1446
01:58:36,870 --> 01:58:38,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nobody gets beyond this point.

1447
01:58:38,370 --> 01:58:39,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't touch me.

1448
01:58:39,770 --> 01:58:41,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss! Wait a minute...

1449
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:42,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay.

1450
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:43,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nancy.

1451
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:45,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grace.

1452
01:58:45,510 --> 01:58:47,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll find Anna. I know they will.

1453
01:58:47,550 --> 01:58:48,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know they will.

1454
01:58:48,950 --> 01:58:50,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.How is she?

1455
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:52,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is she awake?

1456
01:58:52,790 --> 01:58:55,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Joy,were you far from our street?

1457
01:58:55,220 --> 01:58:57,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How far from the street were you,Joy?

1458
01:58:57,830 --> 01:58:59,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Joy?

1459
01:58:59,060 --> 01:59:00,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't be doing this now.

1460
01:59:00,730 --> 01:59:02,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How long did it take you to get there?

1461
01:59:02,830 --> 01:59:04,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just let me ask a question! Please. Keller!

1462
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:06,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The detective will be back in just a minute.

1463
01:59:06,030 --> 01:59:07,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to wait.

1464
01:59:07,030 --> 01:59:08,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's been drugged.

1465
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:10,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Joy.

1466
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweetheart...

1467
01:59:11,310 --> 01:59:15,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just let us know she's alive,okay?

1468
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:16,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you just nod your head,baby?

1469
01:59:16,980 --> 01:59:20,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just nod your head? Baby?

1470
01:59:20,150 --> 01:59:21,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you give us a nod?

1471
01:59:21,580 --> 01:59:23,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you nod your head for us,please? Joy?

1472
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:37,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Joy?

1473
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:12,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were there.

1474
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:14,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? I was... I was where?

1475
02:00:14,870 --> 02:00:18,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It put tape on our mouths.

1476
02:00:18,370 --> 02:00:19,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shhh.

1477
02:00:19,740 --> 02:00:24,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay.It's okay,baby.

1478
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:26,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's okay. It's okay.

1479
02:00:26,750 --> 02:00:29,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mommy and daddy are here now,okay?

1480
02:00:29,820 --> 02:00:31,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're all right.

1481
02:00:31,150 --> 02:00:33,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. You're all right now.

1482
02:00:33,550 --> 02:00:35,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said nobody's allowed in that room but her family.

1483
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:38,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Where you goin'?

1484
02:00:38,130 --> 02:00:39,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keller?

1485
02:00:39,490 --> 02:00:40,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Where's he goin'?

1486
02:00:40,890 --> 02:00:43,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. Hey!

1487
02:00:43,230 --> 02:00:45,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Call downstairs. Don't let him go.

1488
02:00:45,130 --> 02:00:47,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Hey! Block off the exits.

1489
02:00:47,300 --> 02:00:50,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

1490
02:00:51,970 --> 02:00:53,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop that car! Get his truck!

1491
02:00:53,510 --> 02:00:57,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it! Hey! Hey!

1498
02:02:52,860 --> 02:02:56,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For scaring you the other day at the,uh,the police station.

1499
02:02:56,860 --> 02:02:59,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You already apologized for that.

1500

1502

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you know,I noticed your door here needs fixing,

1503

02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:25,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No need to make excuses.

1509

1511
02:03:58,760 --> 02:04:03,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to have to hurt you.

1512

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know they were here.

1513
02:04:06,330 --> 02:04:12,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put your hands on your head and turn around.

1514
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:13,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do it.

1515

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just gonna go.

1516
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:20,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't touch that bag.

1517
02:04:20,950 --> 02:04:24,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put your hands on your head.

1518

1523
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:09,090

1524
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:14,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But believe me when I tell you,I won't let you go.

1525
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:23,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't have to drink all of it.

1526
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:28,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}About a third should do for a man your size.

1527
02:05:28,550 --> 02:05:31,350
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something to make you more manageable.

1528
02:05:31,350 --> 02:05:33,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forget it.

1529

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drink it,Mr. Dover,

1530
02:05:34,350 --> 02:05:36,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or I'll kill you right here in my kitchen

1531

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and bring your daughter in here

1532
02:05:38,030 --> 02:05:39,420

1533
02:05:39,430 --> 02:05:40,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is she?

1534
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:45,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drink.

1535
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just let me see her.

1536
02:05:47,370 --> 02:05:49,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to see her? Yes!

1537
02:05:49,770 --> 02:05:53,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's your ticket to your daughter right there.

1538
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:05,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A little more,Mr. Dover.

1539
02:06:05,550 --> 02:06:07,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little more.

1540
02:06:12,890 --> 02:06:14,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good,isn't it?

1541
02:06:14,630 --> 02:06:18,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's my darlin' husband's recipe.

1542
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:27,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now go on out back.

1543
02:06:27,980 --> 02:06:30,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me see her.

1544
02:06:33,980 --> 02:06:37,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take it out of your pocket.

1545
02:06:40,090 --> 02:06:41,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put it in the sink.

1546
02:06:44,120 --> 02:06:46,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put it in the disposal.

1547
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:57,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put your car keys on the table.

1548
02:06:59,870 --> 02:07:03,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put your car keys on the table.

1549
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:06,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's right.

1550
02:07:06,550 --> 02:07:08,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Over to the trans am over there.

1551
02:07:08,650 --> 02:07:10,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The car over there.

1552
02:07:10,150 --> 02:07:12,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on,move it. Get over there.

1553
02:07:20,230 --> 02:07:23,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The look on your face.

1554
02:07:23,630 --> 02:07:26,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My husband used to have the very same look...

1555
02:07:26,370 --> 02:07:27,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Till we took Alex.

1556
02:07:27,830 --> 02:07:30,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was the first kid we ever took.

1557
02:07:30,540 --> 02:07:32,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His name was Jimmy.

1558
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:34,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or Barry.

1559
02:07:34,710 --> 02:07:36,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can't remember. Doubt he can,either.

1560
02:07:36,740 --> 02:07:38,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So many names.

1561
02:07:38,510 --> 02:07:41,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forgot all about Bobby Taylor

1562
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:44,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}till I read about him in the paper.

1563
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:47,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in the driver's seat.

1564
02:07:56,730 --> 02:08:00,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open the door and get in the car.

1565
02:08:13,710 --> 02:08:20,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Making children disappear is the war we wage with God.

1566
02:08:20,090 --> 02:08:23,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Makes people lose their faith.

1567
02:08:23,220 --> 02:08:26,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turns them into demons like you.

1568
02:08:26,530 --> 02:08:31,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Had to slow down since my husband disappeared.

1569
02:08:31,870 --> 02:08:35,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I do what I can.

1570
02:08:35,100 --> 02:08:37,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Start the car.

1571
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:39,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Start the car.

1572
02:08:44,410 --> 02:08:47,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep tryin'.

1573
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:55,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back up. Slowly.

1574
02:08:58,260 --> 02:09:02,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Back up.

1575
02:09:04,100 --> 02:09:05,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

1576
02:09:09,070 --> 02:09:10,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop.

1577
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:13,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn it off.

1578
02:09:13,140 --> 02:09:14,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Turn it off!

1579
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:18,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out.

1580
02:09:26,820 --> 02:09:28,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think you should know.

1581
02:09:28,790 --> 02:09:32,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alex never laid a hand on those girls.

1582
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:35,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just wanted to take 'em for a ride in the camper.

1583
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:38,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was the one who decided they should stay.

1584
02:09:40,470 --> 02:09:43,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take a look.

1585
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe your daughter's under there.

1586
02:09:46,310 --> 02:09:48,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never know.

1587
02:09:50,610 --> 02:09:52,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anna.

1588
02:09:52,450 --> 02:09:55,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anna!

1589
02:09:55,180 --> 02:09:57,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anna?

1590
02:09:59,550 --> 02:10:02,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anna. Anna!

1591
02:10:02,290 --> 02:10:03,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anna!

1592
02:10:03,460 --> 02:10:05,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anna?!

1593
02:10:05,030 --> 02:10:07,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I had the girls down there

1594
02:10:07,030 --> 02:10:09,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when the police came pokin' around.

1595
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:12,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Should have left 'em down there.

1596
02:10:12,570 --> 02:10:15,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was so lonely without Alex.

1597
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:19,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now get in there.

1598
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:21,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?
