{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They do not, repeat, not, have food like this in the sewer.

42
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A sewer rat!

43
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who... What... How did you get here?

44
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know. One minute I'm in the pub. Next thing you know, whoosh!

45
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's a burst water main! Off I go, shooting up the pipes.

46
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And, well, here I am.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I have a plunger. We can shoot you right back.

48
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you like seafood?

49
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can I call you a cab?

51
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Have you got a TV?

52
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Yes, but... - Say no more!

53
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No. Leave that.

54

56
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Would you look at the size of that monster?!

57
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Careful, mate. Those aren't chocolate buttons.

58
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's the match of the century! The FIFA World Cup Final!

59
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- England. Germany. - Yes! Boo!

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This place is great! I'm staying here forever!

62
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?

63
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Game point. Service!

64
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We win, we win! You lose! In your face!

65
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right, my friend. You don't belong here. I'm afraid it's time for you to leave.

66
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I would not do that if I was you, pal.

67
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let me lay this out for you. This place is mine now.

68
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sid says, "Jump," you say, "How high?" Comprende?

69
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fetch us some Pop-Tarts from the kitchen, Jeeves. Be snappy about it.

70
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

71
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's more like it.

72
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But before breakfast is served...

73
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...perhaps sir would care to take a whirl in the Jacuzzi.

74
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A Jacuzzi?

75
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're a real gent.

76
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}After a hard day navigating sewer pipes,

77
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}there's nothing better than relaxing in a Jacuzzi whirlpool bath.

78
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That looks so inviting.

79
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes. The water looks perfect!

80
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now you hop in, and I'll press this lever to get the bubbles going.

81
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right. In we go!

82
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

83
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know we got off on the wrong foot before,

84
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but I think we're gonna get along, don't you?

85
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Swimmingly.

86
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Be seeing you.

87
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You plonker!

88
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You think I don't know a toilet when I see one?

89
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You were going to flush me down the loo.

90
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No! It's a big Jacuzzi! Deluxe model!

91
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then you won't mind if I get the bubbles going.

92
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No! Not the lever! Have mercy! No, I can't swim!

93
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bon voyage, me old cream cracker!

94
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Hold your nose! - You can't do this!

95
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You were going to try to flush me. Let's see how you like it.

96
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Have you seen my dad?

182
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on, Jammy, me old mate, don't do this to me!

183

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Millicent! - Actually, no...

193
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now, then, where's the ruby, Rita?

194
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The boss wants it back.

195
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't have your stupid ruby.

196
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, are we going to do it the easy way...

197
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...or the hard way?

198
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I think we should do it the easy way, don't you, Spike?

199
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right. Check the tin.

200
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good girl.

201
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}See, Whitey, this is how I do it.

202
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Watch and learn, my son. Watch and...

203
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Was it in there?

204
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right! Rip it up, lads!

205
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, you get your filthy paws off my stuff!

206
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's in here somewhere. I can feel it in me guts!

207
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That'll be last night's curry.

208
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm the same. I got a bum like the Japanese flag.

209
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Will you please tell them I'm not involved in this?

210
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fine. All right, all right, listen up.

211
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This gentleman, he's not from around here.

212
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thank you.

213
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Just look how nicely he's dressed. - Thank you.

214
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And why? Because he's an international jewel thief!

215
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Precisely. What? No, no!

216
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- He stole the ruby from me! - No, she's lying!

217
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, all right! It's time to bring out the Persuader.

218
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Your choice, mate. You can talk now

219
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}or you can talk later. Ain't that right, Persuader?

220
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, in a much higher voice!

221
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The Persuader's alive, Spike!

222
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You'll be singing like a tea kettle.

223
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good one, Persuader.

224
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't even know her! I don't know anything!

225
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Careful, miss. You'll injure yourself.

226
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know where it is!

227
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on, then. Spit it out!

228
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't you dare!

229
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look at her bottom. Is it me, or is it oddly shaped?

230
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You little snitch.

231
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The booty's in the booty.

232
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thanks, mate! The boss is gonna be so happy with us.

233
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're toast.

234
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So you're from Up Top?

235
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I used to work in a laboratory Up Top.

236
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. Big shampoo job.

237
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I was dark grey when we started.

238
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Still, it cleared up me dandruff.

239
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The World Cup has become the most popular sporting event in the world.

240
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you there, boss? We're back.

241
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've got it, boss.

242
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The ruby. I found it.

243
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Technically, Spike, it was Millicent that found it.

244
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Actually, the name's Roddy.

245
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}In exchange for my assistance, I was hoping you might...

246
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You might help me out of the pickle I'm in.

247
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hello, Rita.

248
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hello, handsome.

249
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And who is this? Is your new boyfriend a waiter?

250
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Boyfriend?! - Waiter?!

251
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The prize returns to me.

252
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did you imagine that I'd let you steal it from me?

253
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?! Thatjewel belongs to my father, and you know it!

254
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:09,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Your father? A good-for-nothing scavenger, just like his daughter!

255
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Excuse me. Actually,

256
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm the one that found your ruby.

257
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So... you...

258
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Perhaps you'd repay the favor and help me get home.

259
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Help me!

260
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dispose of them.

261
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, no, no, please! I just want to get home to Kensington!

262
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Kensington? The Royal Borough?

263
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Up Top?

264
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes. Up Top.

265
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Huzzah! A man of quality!

266
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Finally, somebody gets it.

267
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come, let me show you my private collection.

268
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know you'll find it diverting.

269
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My shrine to beauty.

270
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Works of high art crafted in tribute to our beloved Royal Family.

271
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Victoria's bust, wrought in porcelain.

272
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Classy!

273
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Quite lifelike, wouldn't you say?

274
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's as if she were here.

275
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Smooth to the touch.

276
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Easy, tiger.

277
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But come! Let us restore the heart

278
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and highlight of my collection...

279
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...this ruby. Fallen from the very brow of ancient kings.

280
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A true crown jewel!

281
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, what do you think?

282
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's a madman! Run away!

283
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Pardon me. My fly's undone.

284
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, your ruby certainly is a biggie.

285
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Indeed.

286
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How did it ever find me, here in the underbelly of the world?

287
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}In this dark, low place.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"Amusing"?

290
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Didrt you say I'd find it amusing?

291
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I said you'd find it diverting, not amusing!

292
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}When I said "amusing" I really meant it in the sense

293
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}of the ancient Greek muse, the goddess of inspiration.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Heaven help me!

297
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ice him! Ice them both!

298

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's see if there's anything good in the fridge.

299
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Former enemies, one and all.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Makes me laugh every time, that one.

303
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Shut that door.

304
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Liquid Nitrogen! That will freeze us instantly!

305

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There's a paper clip in my back pocket. See if you can get it.

306
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}In the pocket, in the pocket!

307
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Blimey, it's cold.

308

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's why I wore me mittens.

309
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hit men don't wear mittens! Take them off! You're embarrassing me.

310
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's all right for you. You've got little hands.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They might be small, but they're lethal weapons.

315
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You got your mother's hands.

325
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Why are you stopping? Don't we have a plan?

326
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}"We"? Who's "we"?

327

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I kept me legs straight, Spike.

341
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good grief, that's high. Quite high. Rather high. So very, very high.

342
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Cool.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That ruby means a lot to me. It's priceless!

362
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hold on.

363

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A favor?! That ruby was from Queen Elizabeth's crown!

377

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe the Queen wears fake jewelry.

379
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Keep still!

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can we just talk about this?

381
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Real or not, that ruby was going to change my life!

382
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Han Chin Chinese takeout.

384
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- One chicken chow mein. With wonton? - No, crayons!

385
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No wonton! You want rice? Fried or white?

386
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fried. No, wait!

387
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You want wonton or what?

388
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Cancel that order.

389
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rita?

390
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just go away, please.

391
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm sorry.

392
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry?

393
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Me and my dad worked these drains for years.

394
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He broke every bone in his body trying to get that ruby.

395
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It was going to be the answer to all our prayers.

396
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now it turns out it was a stupid fake.

397
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe I can make it up to you.

398
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Get stuffed. - No, no, no.

399
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean it. Back at my place, we've got

400
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}a jewelry box crammed with rubies and diamonds. Real ones.

401
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All you have to do is get me home to Kensington...

402
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...and I'll make you rich beyond your wildest dreams.

403
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How do I know this ain't just a load of old rubbish?

404
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, I suppose you'll just have to trust me.

405
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I must be out of my mind.

406
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right. You've got yourself a deal.

407
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Go on.

408
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You too.

409
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Your own hand.

410
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where are those idiots?

411
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's so hard to get good help these days, my boys.

412
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's right. Come on out, my lovelies.

413
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Cheer your old dad up.

414
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Poor Daddy, surrounded by filthy rats

415
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}in this joyless, sunless void!

416
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But don't worry, little men.

417
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Daddy will get rid of them all! He will.

418
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}They'll all be deady-weady.

419
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did you find it?

420
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Did you find it?

421
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, we got most of it, boss.

422
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Forget the ruby! It's the master cable that I want.

423
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The one that grubby creature Rita took.

424
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Without it, my plan is ruined!

425
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, chief. Forget the ruby. Ruby's gone.

426
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}See? See? Moving on. We are now your cable guys.

427
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Focused. Cable-centric, boss.

428
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You need to be back in time for the World Cup Final.

429
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Great! Are we watching the game together?

430
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just get the cable!

431
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Keep your legs straight!

432
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Are you sure we should be stopping with goons after us?

433
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We aren't gonna get far without a map, are we?

434
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Is that a house?

435
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, and it's very dangerous. So...

436
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...why don't you wait here.

437
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Waiting here. Excellent idea.

438
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Watch out for the pirana.

439
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rita!

440
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here you go, Annie. You, Shamus.

441
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mimi, get your finger out of your nose. Fergus.

442
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Jojo, no biting. - That is wild good!

443
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rita!

444
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rita's back!

445
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Rita! - Mum! Oh, Mum.

446
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thank goodness you're safe.

447
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rita!

448
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hello, Dad.

449
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Give us a hug, girl!

450
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mom, there's a peeping Tom outside!

451
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tom?! Ohh, it's Tom Jones!

452
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mother, it's not Tom Jones.

453
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's just my passenger.

454
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- He's very good-Iooking. - He is not coming in.

455
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Soup's on!

456
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's lovely. Thanks, Mum.

457
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So how long have you been Rita's boyfriend?

458
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's not my boyfriend.

459
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Will you make an honest woman of my daughter?

460
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dad!

461
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We were thinking of a spring wedding, right, cream puff?

462
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look, I want all of you to know he's...

463
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tom Jones!

464
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So your name is "Roddy," is that right?

465
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, that's right. Roddy St. James.

466
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What a beautiful name.

467
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Hi, Roddy. - Who might you be, little chap?

468
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- They call me Shocky. - Why do they call you that?

469
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Shocky! - Yes! Got it.

470
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rita, where are you taking this handsome young man?

471
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's why I need your maps, Dad.

472
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Because he's from... Up Top.

473
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Kitchen. Now.

474
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sing us a song, Tom!

475
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I'm not saying it isn't risky. - But it's impossible, Rita.

476
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No one's ever got past the rapids at Hyde Park.

477
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Dad, Dad! He's gonna pay us.

478
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}For the last time, we don't need the money!

479
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A new stove might be nice.

480
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Talking about the little lady - Go, Tom! Go!

481
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Sing to my heart! - She's a lady

482
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Talking about that old lady

483
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And the lady wears big undies

484
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Huge undies.

485
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Psst! Rita!

486
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's OK. It's me, Liam.

487
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Quick, in the kitchen.

488
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look at those moves!

489
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I love you, Tom!

490
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This bloke isn't who he says he is.

491
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}His real name is Millicent Bystander, an international jewel thief.

492
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A mastermind, a super-criminal.

493
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Looks like he crossed The Toad and got away with it.

494
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I'm a thinker. I've got a plan.

495
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}More! More!

496
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- That was brilliant! - Oh, it was nothing.

497
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- So you're from Up Top? - Yes.

498
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- I've met one of your lot before. - Really?

499
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Used to be some old lady's pet.

500
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's nice.

501
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Terribly Ionely for him, though. He had no one to talk to.

502
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No one to cuddle with!

503
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No one to shocky.

504
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's no life, is it?

505
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'd better get these dishes started.

506
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please, permit me.

507
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, you're such a gentleman!

508
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Great! So I hand Roddy over to The Toad

509
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and claim the reward.

510
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then we're all sitting pretty for the rest of our lives. Is that it?

511
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The Toad will pay a fortune for him.

512
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's a bad one anyway, so that's all right, isn't it?

513
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You cheeky little monkey. I won't have no son of mine acting the rat.

514
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We Malones never go back on our word.

515
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- He's gonna steal your boat. - He won't.

516
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- He's stealing your boat. - He isn't stealing...

517
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- He stole your boat. - What?

518
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's like Robin Hood in reverse.

519
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oi! I thought we had a deal!

520
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So did I!

521
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is an emergency! Get out of the way! Emergency!

522
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Keep clear! I'm coming, Mr. Jones, I'm coming! Marry me, Mr. Jones!

523
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Roddy!

524
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That double-crossing little schemer. I don't need her.

525
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I mean, anyone can get out and sail. Look at me!

526
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, Sid, you're in for a big surprise.

527
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look out!

528
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sorry!

529
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sid's Tattoo and Hot Dog Parlor.

530
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's Roddy. Remember me?

531
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- The butler? - Roddy!

532
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Listen, you! If you're still there when I get back...

533
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Back? Back? How will you do that then, Roddy?

534
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What was that? - Gotta go, Rodders.

535
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}If I find one thing out of place...

536
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here's a little song I wrote

537
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You might want to sing it note for note

538
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't worry

539
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Be happy

540
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't worry, be happy now

541
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where are they hiding?

542
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Think. Think.

543
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}To find a rat, you got to think like a rat.

544
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hey, guys.

545
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've had a tip-off. They're heading west to Kensington.

546
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bingo!

547
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Scrabble!

548
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Enough games. To the ratmobiles!

549
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, OK. We can fix it.

550
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, we can. Obviously...

551
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fairly major burn to the hand. Smell of burning flesh.

552
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Maybe I should just...

553
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That really hurt.

554
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just start, you won'thless old pile of rubbish! You useless, unreliable...

555
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Untrustwon'thy, double-crossing, two-faced, conniving little toe-rag!

556
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So I'm the double-crosser? Oh, yes, that's rich!

557
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I overheard everything.

558
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, you and your family were gonna sell me to The Toad!

559
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?

560
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You dipstick! That was my stupid little brother's plan.

561
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And no one listens to him.

562
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Must have missed that part.

563
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}How could you think I'd sell you out? When I make a deal, I make a deal.

564
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Your hair's on fire.

565
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?

566
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rita, look...

567
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:10,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...I'm sorry. I was wrong. I think we should just put it behind us.

568
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK. I suppose I can put it behind me.

569
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is such an overreaction!

570
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rita, you can'tjust leave me here on a...

571
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}On a duck! Up the creek without a...

572
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're getting everything you deserve. Sneaking around,

573
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}eavesdropping on people's conversations.

574

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes. Could you fly quite suddenly off the boat, screaming like a girl?

648
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, dear.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I want it back.

667
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't worry. I'll get it back for you.

669
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}To wash away, once and for all, the curse, the scourge of...

00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Forgive me, my warty English cousin,

672
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but this bizarre obsession with the rats, it is not good for you.

673
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You are becoming what we French call le fruitcake.

674
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:19,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Perhaps you forget that it was a rat who cast me from paradise!

675
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, please. Not the scrapbook again!

676
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My memoirs.

677
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Volume one details the dire and tragic story of my youth.

678
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, mon Dieu!

679
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Of all the pets in Buckingham Palace,

680
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}young Prince Charles fancied me the best.

681
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We would frolic day after sunny day in royal abandon,

682
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:50,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}sharing that sweet and magical bond between boy and toad.

683
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're gonna make me throw up.

684
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We were inseparable until...

685
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...it arrived.

686
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That rat!

687
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}While the poor boy's head was turned,

688
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:08,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I was cruelly plunged into a whirlpool of despair.

689
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know, I know. You were flushed away down the loo, right?

690
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oi.

691
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Boo-hoo-hoo. It is so dark,

692
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}so cold, so terrible!

693
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You find my pain funny?

694
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I find everyone's pain funny but my own.

695
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm French.

696
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just get the cable!

697
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Henchfrogs!

698
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We have a mission. Let nothing stand in our way.

699
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We leave immediately.

700
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What about dinner?

701
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We leave... in five hours.

702
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Love, love, love, love

703
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is quite tasty.

704
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thanks.

705
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Not too bad, considering I only had an apple, six raisins and a box of rice.

706
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rice?

707
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What's that urge from deep inside?

708
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The need to hurl won't be denied

709
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That isn't rice That's maggots you're eating

710
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:29,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Larva, larva, larva...

711
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:34,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That explains why it all ran to one side when I put the salt in.

712
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know...

713
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...I think we did pretty well today.

714
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I suppose maybe I misjudged you a bit. I mean, you're not...

715
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do I hear an actual compliment coming?

716
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Never mind. - No, no, no, say it.

717
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're not the useless, whiny, stuck-up, pompous, big girl's blouse I thought.

718
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}There. Was that so hard?

719
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We better get some rest if we're gonna get you home tomorrow.

720
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Catch.

721
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tell me about yourself, Roddy.

722
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, there's not much to tell.

723
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:20,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You know all about me, warts and all. I don't even know what you do.

724
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm...

725
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm in a boy band.

726
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah. Yeah, I'm the posh one.

727
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm serious.

728
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tell me about your life Up Top. Friends, family.

729
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You do have a family, don't you?

730
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Of course I do. Brothers, sisters, cousins. We're quite a clan.

731
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You wouldn't believe the fun we have.

732
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hanging out at the movies, playing golf, going skiing.

733
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's just so great!

734
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No wonder you want to get home.

735
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah.

736
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, I guess tomorrow we'll both get what we want.

737
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good night.

738
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good night, Roddy.

739

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good night.

740
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good night.

741
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Good night.

742

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Don't let the bedbugs bite.

743
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wakey-wakey!

744

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Getting close to Kensington.

745
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Tie down anything loose. It'll be a bumpy ride.

746
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Aye, aye, captain.

747
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Thank you. - You're welcome.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who invited you onboard?

751
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hop it. Hop it!

752
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The English little girly, she's so aggressive.

753
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Le Frog.

754
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:27,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I like a woman with a little fire.

755
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:33,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're going to pay for that, my little chocolate croissant!

756
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But first, a word from our sponsor. Marcel?

757
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I should have known.

758
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well done, Le Frog! I salute you, sir.

759
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now then, Rita, hand it over.

760
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hand what over?

761
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This dance of deception must end.

762
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Return what you have stolen from me.

763
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Enough dancing!

764
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't have it anymore. It was a fake anyway.

765
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What?

766
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, the ruby.

767
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:29,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He's cuckoo, but family.

768
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, this is rich.

769
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The ruby was a pretty thing.

770
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stop that.

771
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But nothing when compared to the master cable.

772
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The master what?

773
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The cab...

774
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Turn.

775
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The cable! The one you're now wearing as a belt.

776
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- If that's all he wants... - Hang on.

777
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What do you want it for anyway?

778
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:02,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, you'll see, come the World Cup Final this afternoon.

779
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The World Cup Final?

780
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, OK, cousin, take a breath. Leave it to me.

781
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We'll get your cable, kill the rodents, then me and my team

782
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}can settle down to a decent breakfast.

783
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK, men, to action!

784
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We surrender!

785
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No, not that one, you idiots! The kung fu thing!

786
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've got a plan.

787
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Go for it.

788
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fly at twelve o'clock!

789
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, bother.

790
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Fools! Grab them!

791
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Le Frog! No! Get that cable!

792
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Mon Dieu!

793
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You rats, this is not over yet!

794
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Roddy! The rapids!

795
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, no!

796
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}En garde!

797
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rita? We're going over!

798
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do something!

799
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Gotcha!

800
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Au revoir, mon cheri!

801
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Take your flippers off me!

802
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I have triumphed!

803
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:04,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You stupid English, with your Yorkshire puddings and chips and fish,

804
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:08,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}you thought you could defeat Le Frog? Un...

805
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...deux...

806
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...trois!

807
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Nibble for your life!

808
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}My belt, I think.

809
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You rodents!

810
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Goodbye, Jammy, me old mate.

811
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're OK, we're OK, we're OK, we're OK.

812
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Try opening your eyes!

813
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We're over Kensington!

814
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:10,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, only a terrifying 900-foot drop between you and a nice comfortable bed.

815
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where's your house then?

816
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right, now. Let me see...

817
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:17,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Inverness Gardens, Vicarage Gate, Kensington High Street.

818
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Try and go left.

819
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's it. Now go right.

820
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is gonna be tricky.

821
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yeah, and everything else has been a piece of cake.

822
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All right, here we go.

823
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:33,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Forty-five, 44, 49...

824
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...now!

825
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, I've had softer landings.

826
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We did it.

827
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm home.

828
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:00,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The crew of the Jammy Dodger survives!

829
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yep.

830
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rita?

831
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:10,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, of course. I'm such an idiot. The Dodger.

832
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wasrt your fault, Rod.

833
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Quite an adventure, though, wasrt it?

834
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rita, I am so sorry.

835
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}But I think I might be able to cheer you up.

836
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ta-da! As promised, the Kensington jewels.

837
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A genuine star-cut ruby.

838
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's just beautiful!

839
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And the best part?

840
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Unbreakable.

841
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't know what to say.

842
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You think it will be enough? I mean, to take care of your family?

843
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And maybe this could be the Jammy Dodger Mark Two.

844
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well...

845
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...I suppose this is it.

846
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:11,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Thank you... for the lift.

847
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're welcome.

848
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Roddy? - Yes.

849
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:21,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't suppose you'd have time to give me a quick tour?

850
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Of course.

851
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'd love to meet your family.

852
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hello?

853
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hello, hello, hello? Anybody home?

854
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wouldrt you know it? All out, every one of them.

855
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

856
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What is that? - Oh, that.

857
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's my master bedroom.

858
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:53,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- It's a cage. - No! It's not, actually.

859
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then why the lock and bars?

860
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:58,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That's my... home security system.

861
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:04,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So much to see, so little time to see it in. Shall we?

862
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Roddy.

863
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:09,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You're all alone up here, aren't you?

864
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Goal!

865
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Who's that?

866
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}That would be... my brother!

867
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What a game! I can't believe it!

868
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:27,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}He shoots! He scores! Back of the net! Group hug.

869
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Oh, hello. - Rita, this is...

870
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...Rupert! - What?

871
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rupert, this is Rita. She's been

872
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}so looking forward to meeting my brother.

873
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Obviously, there's not a huge family resemblance.

874
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I rather got the brains and... Well, actually, I got the looks too,

875
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}but we're very close, aren't we, Rupert?

876
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Well, how time flies when you're having fun! Still...

877
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}On with the tour, shall we?

878
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hello, Sid.

879
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Hello, Rita.

880
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:00,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- How's your dad? - Better, yeah. Thanks for asking.

881
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rupert?

882
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What was that all about? Come here, you poor little thing.

883
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:10,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look at his little face. You ever seen anything so pathetic?

884
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Brothers?

885
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}All Mr. Lonely has got is a couple of dolls

886
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and a little wheel to run around in his cage.

887
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}This is too sweet!

888
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What a loser!

889
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's OK, Roddy.

890
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}OK?

891
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:41,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Look at this place, Rita. Look at my home. It's a palace!

892
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:45,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I can do whatever I want whenever I want to.

893
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:48,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'd say that's a little more than OK, wouldn't you?

894
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What do I need a family for? What do I need friends for?

895
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:55,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm sorry, but if you have everything you need, then...

896
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...I really have to get going. I have a serious infestation to deal with.

897
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll say goodbye, then...

898
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...Roddy St. James...

899
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}...of Kensington.

900
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Lonely

901
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:49,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm Mr. Lonely

902
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I have nobody

903
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}For my own

904
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Only ten minutes left until halftime.

905
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And what an amazing match...

906
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:06,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come on, England! This is fantastic!

907
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}A rare attack here by Germany, but it comes to very little.

908
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:15,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come here, bro! Rupert's missing his Rodsy-Wodsy.

909
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here, have a cheese puff.

910
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Have another.

911
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Here you go.

912
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No! Duh. You're supposed to eat them.

913
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Move... over.

914
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- What? - Move over!

915
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll take some of that.

916
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:40,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Word of advice, mate. Take it easy with the drink, seriously,

917
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}or you'll never make it to halftime.

918
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What did you say?

919
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}The bathroom. I'm waiting till halftime.

920
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I don't want to miss any of the game.

921
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:56,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Halftime. He's waiting till halftime!

922
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:59,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Those floodgates won't hold forever!

923
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}No! Not the master cable!

924
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What do you want it for anyway?

925
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:09,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, you'll see, come the World Cup Final this afternoon.

926
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:13,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Half... time.

927
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Half... time.

928
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Of course. That's The Toad's plan! That's why he needs the cable!

929
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:25,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}When everyone goes to the toilet, the city will be flushed away!

930
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Come with me.

931
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:29,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What about the game?

932
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And what a game it is!

933
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:34,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, a nasty fall there for Ray Bowers.

934
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Can you see all right, Fergus?

935
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Yes, thanks, Mum.

936
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:42,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Where's your helmets? Which one's the quarterback? Pick up the ball!

937
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}These Brits don't know the first thing about football.

938
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Enjoy your last moments, you egregious vermin.

939
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:54,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've got Rita, boss! I've got Rita!

940
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Get off me, you lab reject!

941
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ha! You missed.

942
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Ah, Rita.

943
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}It's so good of you to return the cable.

944
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Bonjour.

945
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}At last! It's mine!

946
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just take it.

947
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let there be light!

948
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:41,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Please don't flush me, Roddy! I can't survive down there!

949
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I've gone soft!

950
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Sid, I want you to flush me. I'm going back.

951
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:48,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Back?

952
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rita's in terrible danger. Everyone's in terrible danger!

953
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Now, you like it here, don't you?

954
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:57,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, yes, Roddy. I like it here very much.

955
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And if I leave you, will you be good to Tabitha, the little girl?

956
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:05,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'll be as good as gold to her, Roddy. And I will be the best pet ever!

957
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Then the place is all yours.

958
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- Sweet! - Great.

01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:12,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Let's get the bubbles going. I've got a big job to do down there.

960
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Right away, sir!

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And, Io, a chosen one shall come down from above,

965
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:32,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and he shall be our savior from the Great Flood!

966
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm terribly sorry.

967
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:39,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Just two minutes left till halftime! Incredible!

968
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}- It's a fantasy start for England. - Rita!

969

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}England leads Germany by three goals to one.

970
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:47,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}What an amazing game this is turning out to be!

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}And the referee again has to bring play to a halt.

973
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Rita!

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I'm sorry. I've been such a fool. You were right about me and everything.

981
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:34,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I should have admitted it, but I was afraid you wouldn't like me anymore.

982
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:37,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Do you think we can talk about this after you rescue me?

983
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Of course. There's no time. When that whistle blows

984
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}and everyone Up Top goes to the toilet, it'll flush away the city.

985
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:46,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I know. And my family are all down there.

986
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}We've got to warn everyone.

987
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:49,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Stop them!

988
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}Oh, dear.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}I saw an opportunity and I seized it.

991
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:15,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}So you thought you could make a fool of The Toad, eh?

992
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You don't need us for that.

993
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}You think you're so clever, don't you?

994
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,600

996
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\3c&H000000&\i1}For I shall repopulate the city...

997
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,700
