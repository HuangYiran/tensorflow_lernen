對于恐怖襲擊的不懈打擊

17

我們將一視同仁

這是恐怖主義行動

21
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,590
這是可鄙懦弱的行動

直到他受到了阻擊
...until something stops him.

25
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,850
整個事件就發生在我的眼前
It was right in front of my eyes,

26
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,850
而我絲毫沒預料到
and I never saw it coming.

27
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,170
該飛機撞向了世貿中心

28

成千上萬的民眾東奔西逃

我不是不明真相的那個人

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,920
拿下

我要把你放回伊朗

00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,190
我決定再給我們的婚姻一次機會

46
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,690
他走之前告訴我一些事

47
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,000
關于總部炸彈襲擊者的事
about the Langley bomber.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,940
你是說布洛迪
You mean Brody.

49
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,720
不  就是這點  不是他
No, that's just it. It's not him.

50
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,400
那個襲擊者是唯一可以證明布洛迪清白的人
The bomber's the only way to prove that Brody's innocent.

51
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,480

Carrie, what the fuck are you doing?

52
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,260
卡莉  馬上回去
Carrie, turn around now.

53
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,100
這是對你的最后警告
This is your last warning.

54
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,800
她左上臂受了槍傷
Got a gunshot wound to the upper left bicep.

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,410
大出血  可能是射穿動脈了

56
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,370
索爾在他媽什么地方
Where the fuck is Saul?

57
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,080
你醒了
You're awake.

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,110
我這是在哪兒
Where am I?

59
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,260
海軍醫院

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,350
你中槍后被他們送了過來

61
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,010
小心點  別把傷口撐裂了
Careful, you don't want to rip the sutures.

62

縫了不少針

子彈穿透了身體  沒傷到骨頭
It was a through and through. Missed the bone.

65
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,360

You're lucky.

66
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,320
不  是他槍法準
No, he's just a great shot.

67
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,320
我要在這里待多久

68
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,690
該待多久就待多久
As long as you need to be.

69
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,950
是等我痊愈
For me to heal

70
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,640
還是等中情局想出處理我的辦法
or for the CIA to figure out what to do with me?

71
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,330
這事你得問他們
You'd have to talk to them.

72
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,440
你知道自己懷孕十三周了嗎
Are you aware you're 13 weeks pregnant?

73
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,530
知道
Yes.

74
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,620
孩子應該沒事
The baby should be fine.

75
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,120
如果你想知道的話
In case you're wondering.

76
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,340
瞳孔對光有反應

高壓60  低壓40

78
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,490
太他媽低了
Too fucking low.

79
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:25,750
躺下
Lay down.

80
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,330
他在飛機上毒癮發作
He started going cold turkey on the flight,

81
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,350
所以他們就用半斤伏特加把他灌暈了
so they knocked him out. With a half pint of Vodka.

82
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,460
一群白癡
Idiots.

83
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,600
脈搏微弱
Pulse is thready.

84
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,740
放松
Take it easy.

85
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,930
我的東西呢  你們這群屌賊
Where's my stuff, you fucking thieves?!

86
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,260
操  把東西還我
Fuck! Where is my stuff?!

87
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,640
冷靜  該死
Calm down, goddamn it!

88
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,970
我的東西呢
Where's my stuff?

89
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,080
別動
Don't move now.

90
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,200
在洛克哈特正式上任前  你還有七天時間
You've got seven days till Lockhart's confirmed.

91
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,270
你覺得這家伙到時能準備好嗎
You think this guy's gonna be ready by then?

92
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,940
我們沒想到他會變成那樣
He's not what we expected...

93
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,920
但他是我們唯一的籌碼
But he's what we've got.

94
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,800
如果他同意合作的話
If he agrees to do it.

95
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,000
他簡直一團糟
He's a mess:

96
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,760
貧血
Anemic...

97
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,560
嚴重脫水  可能還得了丙型肝炎
Severely dehydrated, probably Hep C.

98
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,710
無法確認是否感染艾滋病毒
HIV isn't a stretch.

99
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,400
如果你建議送他去醫院  我絕不會答應
If you're suggesting a hospital, it's out of the question.

100
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,730
我肯定能保住他的命
I'm pretty sure I can keep him stable,

101
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,840
可這家伙有毒癮
but the guy's a junkie, sir.

102
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,030
戒斷得多久
How far is he into withdrawal?

103
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,410
很困難
Hardly started.

104
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,100
他現在的情況
What he's feeling now,

105
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,370
會發展到非常可怕的地步
it's gonna get a hell of a lot worse.

106
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,140
美沙酮也許有點用
Methadone would make it easier.

107
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,900
必須完全戒掉
Has to be cold turkey.

108
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,500
無論如何都得讓他正常起來
Where he's going, we need him functional.

109
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,340
不怕搞死他嗎
Even if it kills him?

110
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,600
不會的
It won't.

111
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,610
有你負責保他的命
'Cause you will keep him alive.

112
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,290
懂了嗎
Do you understand?

113
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,430
收到
Sir.

114
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,610
沒事吧
You all right?

115
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,600
別動  你想干嘛
Stop! What are you doing?

116
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,410
我得來一針
I need it!

117
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,210
那邊沒有你要的東西
There's nothing there for you.

118
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,490
-我受不了了  -不行
- No, I need it now! - No.

119
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,840
給我  給我  給我
Damelo! Damelo! Dame...

120
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,470
摁住他
Hey, grab him!

121
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:13,790
針呢
Where's the needle?

122
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,820
來了
Got it.

123
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,310
蓋上他  摁住
Cover him up. Stay down.

124
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,640
求你了
Please...

125
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,920
感覺如何
How are you feeling?

126
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,940
醫生說你恢復得不錯
The doctor says you're progressing nicely.

127
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,380
很快就能起來活動了
You'll be up and walking in no time.

128
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,090
不過  估計不會讓你出病房
Though, not necessarily out of here.

129
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,010
門口有兩名警衛守著
There are two armed guards outside your door.

130
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,020
這一系列事件讓我深深地意識到
You know it never ceases to amaze me

131
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,310
你們有多么團結
how you people close ranks.

132
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,880
比如現在
Here you are,

133
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,510
你在中情局外勤任務中亂來而自食其果
a casualty of some CIA op gone very, very wrong,

134
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,210
基本上成了囚犯
basically a prisoner,

135
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,190
但不知道為什么  我卻成了敵人
and still, somehow, I'm the enemy.

136
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,660
你很清楚
You are aware

137
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,940
中情局人員
that the CIA charter does not include

138
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,560
禁止在本土行動
operations on U.S. soil?

139
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,510
我還在服用鎮痛劑
You know, I'm on painkillers.

140
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,680
基本不明白你的意思
I can barely understand anything you're saying.

141
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,720
好吧
Well...

142
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,470
我一直在看你的檔案
I've been going through your file.

143
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,010
事實上
The fact is,

144
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,930
你需要個靠得住的人
you need someone you can trust.

145
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,490
這話怎么講
And why is that?

146
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,940
你被一槍撂倒  總想問個究竟吧
You're lying there shot and you need to ask?

147
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,320
對你下這狠手那位
The man who did this to you,

148
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,320
馬上就要滾蛋了
he's on his way out.

149
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,530
可我還是想知道
But I need to know...

150
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,260
他的目的何在
what's he up to?

151
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,310
問他吧
Ask him.

152
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,740
他跑加拉加斯去干什么
What was he doing in Caracas?

153
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,540
恐怕你還不知道他去那里了吧
You didn't even know he was there, did you?

154
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,400
卡莉那里又有消息了
I got another message from Carrie.

155
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,880
她冷靜下來了吧
Is she calming down at all?

156
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,390
恰恰相反
No, the opposite.

157
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,220
洛克哈特議員去找她了
Senator Lockhart just paid her a visit.

158
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,720
他知道我們來加拉加斯了
Somehow, he knows about Caracas.

159
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,600
不可能
It's impossible.

160
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,920
反正他知道了
Well, he does.

161
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,100
你認為他起疑了
You think he suspects?

162
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,110
我確定他不知情
I'm sure he doesn't have a clue.

163
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,900
但她知道了
She does now.

164
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,640
那我們怎么辦
So what do we do about that?

165
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,110
老樣子
Same as before;

166
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,180
讓她就待在醫院
keep her under guard at the hospital.

167
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,570
不能見布洛迪
Away from Brody.

168
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,290
洛克哈特呢
And Lockhart?

169
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,480
真不知道他怎么知道的
I don't know how the hell he found out.

170
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,540
這事只有你知我知
No one knew besides us.

171
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,950
查查我們的家里和辦公室
Have our houses and offices swept.

172
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,410
所有房間都徹底查查
Every room, top to bottom.

173
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,240
什么情況
What happened?

174
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,250
拉了一身
Shat himself.

175
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,790
天吶
Jesus Christ.

176
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,400
你們是誰
Who are you?

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,150
別說話
Don't talk.

178
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,250
你們是軍方的吧
You're soldiers, aren't you?

179
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,490
別說話
Don't talk.

180
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,210
太燙了  燙死了
It's burning! It's burning.

181
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,420
水不熱
It's not hot.

182
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,030
太燙了
It's burning!

183
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,360
這種狀態  甚至更糟的情況還會持續三天
It'll continue as bad as this, or worse, another three days.

184
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,530
然后毒性從機體代謝
And at least a week after that

185
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,070
至少還得一周
before the stuff's out of his system.

186
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,640
就是說得十天了
So you're saying ten days.

187
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,090
我們只有六天
We have six.

188
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,550
而且等他緩過來
Plus, at the end of all this,

189
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,780
肯定也跟只慫貓一樣了
he's gonna be weak as a fuckin' kitten.

190
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,600
還有個辦法
There is another option.

191
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,090
什么
What?

192
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,720
伊菠因
Ibogaine.

193
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,990
一種尼日利亞植物中的萃取物
It's a drug based on a Nigerian plant.

194
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,610
它可以極大地加速戒毒進程
It dramatically accelerates the withdrawal process

195
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,820
徹底戒除毒癮
and kills the addiction.

196
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,100
副作用很厲害
The side effects are brutal,

197
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,610
所以在這里是非法的
which is why it's outlawed here.

198
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,400
惡心  嘔吐  產生幻覺
Nausea, vomiting, some hallucinations.

199
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,800
暴力的  讓人精神錯亂的幻覺
Violent, mind-bending hallucinations.

200
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,500
有用嗎
Does it work?

201
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,530
有用
It does.

202
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,540
相信我
Take my word.

203
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,150
從蒙特祖瑪的大廳
From the halls of Montezuma

204
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,940
到的黎波里的海岸
to the shores of Tripoli

205
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,220
在空中  在陸地  在海洋
We fight our country's battles

206
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,660
我們為祖國而戰
in air, on land and sea...

207
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,510
說話  你這混蛋
Say something, you motherfucker.

208
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,790
別光是站在那兒
Don't just stand there.

209
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,070
說話
Say something...

210
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,460
先是為了權利與自由而戰
First to fight for right and freedom

211
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,250
讓我們的榮譽干干凈凈
and to keep our honor clean

212
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,770
我們驕傲的宣稱
We are proud to claim the title

213
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,130
我們是美國海軍陸戰隊
of United States marine.

214
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,320
我們是美國海軍陸戰隊
Of United States marine.

215
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,070
天吶
God...

216
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,700
天吶
God...

217
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,700
天吶
God...

218
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,020
滾開
Get out.

219
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,540
滾開
Get out!

220
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,500
你們他媽給我吃了什么
What the fuck did you give me?!

221
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,560
不
No...

222
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,450
給我
Give me that!

223
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,420
[阿語]

224
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,620
[阿語]

225
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,440
放開我
Get off me!

226
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,860
放開
Get off!

227
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,160
[阿語]

228
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
放開我  不
Get off me, no!

229
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,500
[阿語]

230
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,880
他現在會睡著
He'll sleep now.

231
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,430
一會兒
For a while.

232
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,370
也許我們應該用固話打給索爾
Maybe we should just call Saul's landline,

233
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,400
啟動語音激活
trigger the voice activation,

234
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,330
復查我們的跟蹤程序
double-check our tracking program.

235
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,440
是可以
We could.

236
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,850
但是
But...?

237
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,760
這棟房子租給了
This house is leased to

238
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,500
特拉維夫的一個航運集團
a shipping consortium out of Tel Aviv.

239
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,080
我覺得背后肯定有摩薩德的影子
It's got Mossad written all over it.

240
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,260
是  但如果就只是個監控臺
Yeah, but what if it's just a monitoring station,

241
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,600
或是情報傳送點呢
or a dead drop?

242
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,440
那我們就他媽是在浪費時間
Then we're wasting our fucking time.

243
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,890
你看到了嗎
Are you gettin' this?

244
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,160
你還活著
You're alive.

245
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,610
不是什么好事
That wasn't a given.

246
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,540
想喝水嗎
Want some water?

247
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,220
為什么不把我留在那里自生自滅呢
Why couldn't you have just left me there to die?

248
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,150
你知道我不能那么做
I think you know that wasn't really an option.

249
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,360
所以
So...

250
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,500
現在怎么辦
...What now?

251
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,310
那取決于你
That'll be up to you.

252
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,920
審訊嗎
A trial?

253
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,510
但不是我干的
'cause I didn't do it.

254
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,520
你是在說中情局的爆炸嗎
You talking about bombing the CIA?

255
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,780
我比較相信你的說法
I'm inclined to agree.

256
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,380
但你的罪行不是在那里開始或結束的
But your transgressions don't begin or end there.

257
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,410
我不打算糾結那件事
And I'm not about to engage in a back and forth

258
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,560
某種程度上你也是受害者
where you somehow end up the victim.

259
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,080
我們都知道你做了什么
We both know what you've done.

260
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,420
我們都知道你是什么人
We both know what you are.

261
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,760
一個給自己挖下無底深坑的人
A man who's dug himself into a hole so deep,

262
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,410
你知道自己無路可逃
common sense'd tell you there's no way out.

263
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,690
但我要告訴你  也許還有一線生機
I am telling you, though, that there might be.

264
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,310
怎么辦
How?

265
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,520
我給你提供一個機會
I'm offering you a chance

266
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,670
再次成為海軍陸戰隊員
to be a marine again.

267
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,000
成為那個
The man you were...

268
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,820
被他們毀掉之前的人
...before they broke you.

269
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,360
求求你
Please.

270
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,660
不要再來了
No more.

271
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,100
我已經完了
I'm done.

272
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,810
你沒有
You are not.

273
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,520
你會做這最后一件事
You will do this one last thing.

274
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,020
不
No.

275
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,300
殺了我吧
So kill me.

276
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,760
現在就殺了我
Kill me now.

277
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,040
你想死是吧
You want to die, huh?

278
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,130
我們等著瞧
We'll see about that.

279
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,090
把他扔下船
Put him overboard.

280
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,210
去他媽的  我要下去
Fuck this shit. I'm going in.

281
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,000
別去  他會上來的
Don't. He'll come up.

282
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,850
我不信
I don't believe this.

283
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,900
操  我們快下去
Fuck it. Let's go.

284
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,260
拉住他
Pull him...

285
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,500
他像塊石頭一樣沉下去了
He went down like a stone.

286
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,700
完全沒有求生的欲念
No attempt to save himself whatsoever.

287
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,360
現在他絕食了
Now he's refusing to eat.

288
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,460
喂他吃
Make him.

289
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,910
你打算讓我們怎么做
How do you expect us to do that?

290
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,100
強制喂食不會嗎
It's called force-feeding.

291
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,220
恕我直言  長官
All due respect, sir,

292
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,600
這家伙就是個廢人
the guy's a waste of space.

293
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,890
我建議你們  無論對他有什么想法
Now, I suggest whatever you've got in mind for him,

294
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,800
六個月后再說吧
just push it six months.

295
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,330
讓我們來好好處理
Let us do this thing right.

296
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,050
你那堆推心置腹的廢話說完了嗎
You done letting us in on your thought process?

297
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,930
是的  長官
Yes, sir.

298
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,710
喂他吃飯
Get him to eat.

299
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,540
他說得對
He's right, you know.

300
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,910
我們的時間不多了
Our window's closing fast.

301
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,850
勿失良機  索爾
It's now or never, Saul.

302
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,170
你感覺怎么樣
How you feeling?

303
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,270
好像你真的關心一樣
As if you actually cared.

304
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,160
我在這兒有時間思考
You know, I've had time to think here.

305
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,620
我不斷地回想事實
And I keep coming back to the fact

306
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,910
如果沒有你的許可
that this bullet in my shoulder

307
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,290
我肩膀里絕不會有這顆子彈
would never have happened without your okay.

308
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,100
你當時的舉動會連累整個任務
You were about to compromise the mission.

309
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,040
我是想證明布洛迪的清白
I was about to clear Brody.

310
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,620
你說過你會支持的
You said you were behind that.

311
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,320
證明布洛迪的清白
"Clear Brody."

312
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,900
那意味著什么
What does that even mean?

313
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,760
你騙了我
So you lied to me.

314
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,570
你真想談這個
I don't think you want to go there--

315
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,560
到底是誰騙誰
who lied to whom.

316
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,910
布洛迪偷偷溜出境
Brody slipping out of the country

317
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,470
與此同時  你不省人事長達14小時
while you were unconscious for 14 hours.

318
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,240
你覺得我會相信嗎
You think I believed that for a second?

319
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,380
你知道我當時在加拉加斯  你該給我留言的
You know I was in Caracas, you should left me a message.

320
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,130
你不想知道他的近況嗎
Don't you want to know how he is?

321
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,420
他怎么樣
How is he?

322
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,960
不怎么樣
He's not well.

323
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,620
你對他做了什么
What did you do to him?

324
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,260
這個問題背后的推測
You know, the assumptions behind that question

325
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,670
充滿偏見  嚇到我了
are so misguided, it frightens me.

326
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,600
我發現他時  情況已經很糟
I found him in a bad way.

327
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,870
相信我
Believe me.

328
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,080
那不是我想要的
It wasn't something I wanted.

329
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,870
他在哪兒
Where is he?

330
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,420
弗吉尼亞州
In Virginia.

331
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,680
奈克壩基地
At Dam Neck.

332
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,190
我找了一個特別行動小組幫助他康復
Got a special ops team trying to get him in shape.

333
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,180
康復之后呢
In shape for what?

334
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,890
我正想和你談這個
That's what I wanted to talk about.

335
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,100
我設了個局
I have a play.

336
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,130
牽涉到了布洛迪
It involves Brody.

337
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,040
我希望你能說服他
And I'm hoping you'll convince him.

338
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,780
這關乎到所有人的利益
It's in everyone's interest.

339
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,570
你告訴過我賈瓦迪是個局
You told me Javadi was the play.

340
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,780
他是
He is.

341
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,820
布洛迪是下一步
Brody's the next phase.

342
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,700
你為什么需要我
And you need me why?

343
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,380
我猜他已經拒絕你了
I'm assuming he already turned you down.

344
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,630
我們還沒到那一步
We didn't get that far.

345
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,310
正如我所說  他情況不好
Like I said, he's not well.

346
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,320
什么局  你有什么好主意
So, what is it? What's your big idea?

347
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,280
達尼什·阿克巴里
Darnish Akbari.

348
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,840
伊朗革命衛隊的首領
Head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.

349
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,000
對
Right.

350
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,150
賈瓦迪的上司
Javadi's boss.

351
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,500
他還是和平的最大障礙
And the single greatest impediment to peace.

352
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,770
我想除掉他
I want him gone.

353
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,790
祝你好運
Well, good luck with that.

354
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,530
布洛迪能接觸到他
Brody can get to him.

355
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,810
怎么接觸
How?

356
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,400
作為中情局炸彈襲擊者
As the Langley bomber.

357
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,560
布洛迪去那里尋求政治庇護
Brody seeks political asylum there.

358
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,930
和阿克巴里會面  干掉他
Gets an audience with Akbari, takes him out.

359
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,330
賈瓦迪繼承他的衣缽
Javadi's the heir apparent.

360
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,590
他會掌權
He ascends the throne,

361
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,990
然后從伊朗最重要人物前二十
and he goes from being one of the 20 most important people

362
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,100
轉變為前三
in Iran to one of three.

363
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,390
不過他是我們的人
Only he's working for us.

364
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,950
布洛迪干掉他
Brody takes him out?

365
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,020
是的
Yes.

366
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,050
拜托  索爾  你胃口太大了
Come on, Saul, you're reaching.

367
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,300
阿克巴里的安保措施比阿亞圖拉還嚴密
Akbari's better protected than the Ayatollah.

368
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,980
布洛迪總能絕處逢生
Brody's got a knack for getting into tight places.

369
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,690
他之前就做到過
He's done it before.

370
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,730
那充其量就是個自殺性任務
At best it's a suicide mission.

371
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,830
不  他在外面有一個團隊
No, he'll have a team on the ground.

372
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,640
你想讓我說服他這么做
And you expect me to convince him of this?

373
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,240
我希望你能好好考慮
I expect you to consider deeply

374
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,470
讓美國線人打入伊朗權力金字塔的最頂端
the upside of placing a U.S. asset at the very top of

375
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,310
所帶來的益處
the Iranian food chain.

376
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,930
這是我希望的
That's what I expect.

377
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,320
賈瓦迪不僅會是情報來源
Javadi won't be just an intelligence source.

378
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,130
他會控制著
He'll be in control

379
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,410
整個伊朗安全機構
of the entire Iranian security apparatus.

380
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,220
那也不意味著他會洗心革面或是裝死
That doesn't mean he'll roll over and play dead.

381
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,070
我知道
I know.

382
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,240
但他可以做些什么
But he can do something.

383
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,470
從而打破僵局
Something to break the logjam.

384
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,800
且無需挑起另一場戰爭
Something besides another war.

385
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,270
并改變目前的現實
Something that'll change the facts on the ground.

386
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,010
這就足夠了
Just enough.

387
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,030
兩個國家已經有三十多年
So two countries that haven't been able to communicate

388
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,580
都沒能進行交流了
for over 30 years

389
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,280
只有通過恐怖主義行動和威懾行為
except through terrorist actions and threats...

390
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,840
才能讓彼此坐下來談談
...can sit down and talk.

391
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,680
計劃就是這樣  卡莉
That's the play, Carrie.

392
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,390
此舉難道不值得你付出嗎
Tell me it's not worth your time.

393
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,590
布洛迪  我想告訴你
Brody, I want you to know

394
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,910
我今天才知道你在這里
that I didn't know you were here until today.

395
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,760
我一聽到消息就馬上趕來了
I came as soon as I heard.

396
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,090
如果我有什么能幫到你  就跟我說
Tell me if there's anything I can do for you.

397
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,890
什么事都行
Anything.

398
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,910
他最遲何時需要準備好
When do you need him ready by?

399
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,200
本月二十七號
27th of this month.

400
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,640
怎么這么急
Why so soon?

401
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,640
那天是洛克哈特參議員
It's the day Senator Lockhart's

402
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,520
任職聽證開始的日子
confirmation hearings begin.

403
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,100
是啊
Right.

404
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,740
告訴我他在加拉加斯遇到了什么事
Tell me what happened to him in Caracas.

405
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,780
就我們了解  簡直一團糟
A world of shit as far as we know.

406
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,680
他在哥倫比亞邊境腹部中彈
He was gut-shot at the Columbian border.

407
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,000
差點送了命
Nearly died.

408
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,640
我猜還對止痛藥上了癮
Got hooked on the painkillers, I guess.

409
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,670
還在某個清真寺里出了事
There was also an incident at a mosque.

410
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,810
一位伊瑪目和他的妻子被殺
An imam and his wife were murdered.

411
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,200
都因為他嗎
Because of him?

412
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,560
就因為他
Because of him.

413
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,370
我需要一輛車
I need a vehicle.

414
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,560
你的胳膊怎么了
What happened to your arm?

415
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,710
玩懸掛滑翔摔的
Hang gliding accident.

416
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,850
真的假的
For real?

417
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,270
去他媽的中情局  巴拉茲
Fucking CIA, Baraz.

418
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,110
你有什么好問她的
What are you asking her questions for?

419
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,350
就隨便聊聊
Just making conversation.

420
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,590
下個路口左轉
It's the next left.

421
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,110
現在怎么辦
What now?

422
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,460
我們等著
Now we wait.

423
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,050
我們盯了這座房子二十四小時
We sat on the house for 24 hours.

424
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,730
出入過的只有這個人
And this is the only person who ever came in or out.

425
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,620
天吶
Oh, Christ.

426
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,070
你認識他嗎
You know him?

427
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,260
恐怕是的
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

428
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,100
他是什么人
Who is he?

429
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,460
我妻子的一個朋友
A friend of my wife's.

430
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,800
他叫阿倫·伯納德
His name is Alain Bernard.

431
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,330
他們在孟買認識的
She met him in Mumbai.

432
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,550
他們在那邊有過一段關系
They struck up a relationship there,

433
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,940
后來還有沒有繼續就不知道了
which may or may not be ongoing.

434
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,690
我也不想問這個  索爾
I hate to ask this, Saul,

435
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,460
不過  你覺得米拉知道嗎
but do you think Mira's aware?

436
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,510
他是以色列情報人員這事嗎
That he's an Israeli intelligence officer?

437
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,700
不知道
No.

438
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,030
迷戀上這家伙是她唯一的罪過
Falling for the guy is her only crime.

439
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,430
你想讓我做什么
What do you want me to do?

440
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,850
現在嗎
For the time being?

441
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,720
抓住他
Pick him up,

442
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,920
把他丟進地洞里關著去
put him in a dark fucking hole.

443
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,830
那洛克哈特呢
What about Lockhart?

444
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,830
他在其中扮演什么角色
How does he fit into the equation?

445
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,900
我大概漏了一條線索
I think I buried a lead.

446
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,130
什么意思
Meaning what?

447
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,290
這家伙離開安全屋以后
After our guy left the safe house,

448
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,090
我跟蹤他到了彼得餐廳
I followed him to Pete's Diner,

449
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,580
在國會山
Capitol Hill.

450
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,710
丹娜
Dana?

451
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,490
丹娜  丹...
Dana? Dan...

452
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,510
你們這群混蛋  讓我出去
Hey, assholes, let me out!

453
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,170
布洛迪
Brody...

454
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,430
放開我
Get off me!

455
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,560
天吶
Oh...God...

456
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,390
-放我出去  -放松
- Let me the hell out! - Relax!

457
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,390
布洛迪
Brody!

458
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,440
混賬東西
Motherfucker!

459
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,020
丹娜  是我
Dana, it's me!

460
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,040
丹娜
Dana!

461
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,510
-回去  -放開我
- Get back... - Get off of me!

462
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,820
丹娜
Dana!

463
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,820
媽的  丹娜
Fuck. Dana!

464
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,510
她聽不見的  布洛迪
She can't hear you, Brody.

465
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,610
你這個賤人
You...you bitch.

466
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,920
你這個臭婊子
You fucking bitch.

467
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,760
-他在嗎  -您有預約嗎
- Is he in? - Is he expecting you?

468
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,150
先生  您不能進去
Sir, you can't go in there.

469
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,810
反正那晚我還要招待一位籌款人
I'm hosting a fund-raiser that night anyway.

470
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,880
我得掛了
Listen, I got to go.

471
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,400
搞什么鬼  索爾
What the hell, Saul?

472
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,430
這是什么東西
What is this?

473
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,800
打開它
Open it.

474
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,170
你能解釋一下嗎
Care to explain?

475
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:08,720
阿倫·伯納德為《世界報》寫了一篇我的簡介
Alain Bernard is writing a profile on me for Le Monde.

476
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,340
二十分鐘之前
20 minutes ago,

477
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,160
阿倫·伯納德承認自己是以色列情報人員
Alain Bernard admitted to being an asset of Israeli intelligence.

478
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,070
這與我有何相干
And I should be concerned about this... Why?

479
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,230
他聲稱自己曾經將一系列從我家中
Because he claims he passed you information obtained

480
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,930
竊聽到的信息告知于你
from a listening device planted in my home.

481
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,920
扯淡
That's preposterous.

482
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,220
是嗎
Is it?

483
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,630
我一通電話打給貝納永大使
One call to ambassador Benayoun,

484
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,800
這馬上就會成為一次國際事件
it would be an international incident.

485
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,980
再一通電話打給《華盛頓郵報》
A second call to The Post,

486
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,190
你的照片馬上就能登上
and your picture'd be on the front page

487
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,970
全國報紙的頭版頭條
of every newspaper in the country.

488
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,850
你想怎樣
What do you want?

489
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,110
我想要時間
Time.

490
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,010
時間
Time?

491
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,790
只要你把就任局長一事
Postpone your confirmation

492
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,450
推遲到下月中旬
until the middle of next month,

493
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,160
我可以保證這些信息不曝光
and these'll never see the light of day.

494
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,540
我沒搞懂
I don't understand.

495
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,610
這只是個簡單的請求而已
It's a simple request.

496
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,000
再給我幾周時間
Give me a few more weeks.

497
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,530
我不是這個意思
That's not what I meant.

498
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,510
你可以借機一舉打垮我
You could destroy me with this.

499
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,860
繼續穩坐局長一職
You could guarantee your own tenure as director.

500
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,990
為什么要放我一馬
Why are you letting me off the hook?

501
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,830
因為我不想讓我的妻子蒙羞  參議員
Because it would humiliate my wife, senator.

502
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,650
況且這也會讓中情局的名聲掃地
And because it would damage the agency badly.

503
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,230
同意嗎
We have a deal?

504
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,060
成交
We do.

505
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,230
希望你已經可以平心靜氣地跟我談談了
I was hoping you've calmed down enough to talk.

506
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,150
丹娜怎么會在那么偏僻的地方
What's Dana doing cleaning motel rooms

507
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,780
-打掃汽車旅館  -怎么了
- in the middle of nowhere? - Why?

508
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,320
這有什么問題嗎
Is something wrong with that?

509
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,710
-做個鐘點工  -這他媽不是重點
- Being a maid? - There's nothing Wrong with that,

510
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,690
我就是想知道
goddamn it, I just want to know

511
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,320
我女兒到底怎么了
what's going on with my daughter!

512
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,810
先喝點水  然后我們再談丹娜的事
Drink it, and I'll tell you about Dana.

513
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,430
慢點喝  不然會惡心
Slowly, or you'll be sick.

514
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,600
好了
There.

515
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,130
到底怎么回事
Now, what's going on?

516
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,160
她這段日子過得不好  布洛迪
Well, she's had a rough time, Brody.

517
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,360
她輟學了
She dropped out of school.

518
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,440
搬到外面去住
She moved out of the house.

519
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,320
還改了自己的姓
She changed her last name.

520
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,410
帶我回那個汽車旅館
Take me back to the motel.

521
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,140
不可能
That's not gonna happen.

522
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,490
看在上帝的份上  卡莉
For Christ's sake, Carrie.

523
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,490
我告訴過你
I told you.

524
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,860
如果你想再見她一面
If you want to see her again...

525
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,300
別再耍我了  卡莉
Quit your fucking games, Carrie!

526
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,800
我要直視她的雙眼
I need to look her in the eye.

527
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,190
告訴她我是無辜的
I want her to know I'm innocent!

528
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,920
你要是一直吼的話  那我們就沒必要談了
If you keep yelling, this conversation is over.

529
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,190
我想讓這兩個人出去  你能乖乖的嗎
Now I would like to tell these two men to leave, can I do that?

530
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,580
你想怎樣
What do you want?

531
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,980
跟索爾·貝倫森的要求一樣對吧
The same thing as Saul Berenson, I'm guessing.

532
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,820
什么重歸海軍陸戰隊的鬼話
Some bullshit about me being a marine again?

533
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,390
那你想怎樣  布洛迪
What do you want, Brody?

534
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,650
你一直夢寐以求的是什么
What have you always wanted?

535
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,980
一個贖罪的機會
A chance at redemption.

536
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,780
我再說最后一遍  卡莉
For the last time, Carrie.

537
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,140
炸彈不是我放的
I didn't do the bombing.

538
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,410
就算別人不知道  你也該知道
You of all people should know that.

539
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,230
我說的不是炸彈襲擊案
I'm not talking about the bombing.

540
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,880
而是自殺式炸彈背心
I'm talking about the suicide vest.

541
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:31,080
我說的是伊麗莎白·蓋恩斯之死
I'm talking about the death of Elizabeth Gaines

542
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:34,430
還有國務院外的兩名特勤局特工
and those two secret service agents outside the State Department.

543
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:41,240
以及加拉加斯的伊瑪目和他妻子遇害
I'm talking about what happened to that imam and his wife in Caracas.

544
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,170
照索爾說的做
Do what Saul is asking.

545
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,370
-你希望我怎么做  -我希望你
- What you're asking? - All right, what I'm asking.

546
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,630
就算不為自己  也為丹娜考慮
If not for your sake, then for Dana's.

547
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,320
否則的話  即使告訴她你是無辜的
Otherwise, telling her you're innocent is just...

548
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,110
也不過是又一個謊言
...is just one more lie.

549
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,240
瞧我這副樣子  卡莉
Look at me, Carrie.

550
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,330
你現在讓我出去買包煙都成問題
You couldn't send me out for a pack of cigarettes right now.

551
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,630
我們會幫你做好準備
We'll get you ready.

552
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,570
但要你愿意配合才行
You just have to be willing.

553
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,500
瞧是誰跑出來玩了
Well, look who's come out to play.

554
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,750
也該出來了
About fucking time.

555
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,700
征得你媽同意了嗎
Did you get mommy's permission?

556
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,650
大伙都給我閉嘴
Hey, shut the fuck up, everybody.

557
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,080
沿著這邊跑
We're going this way.

558
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,370
準備好了嗎
You ready?

559
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,180
快點
Come on.

560
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,350
站起來
On your feet.

561
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:31,010
別動  他得靠自己
No. He needs to do it by himself.

562
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,530
什么時候能繼續跑
Tell me when you're good to go again.

563
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,340
就現在
Now.

564
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,550
跟上
Go.

565
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,360
十六天后

566
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,550
找到莫桑比克馬普托市
Find Maputo, Mozambique.

567
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,710
接收頻率是多少
What's the frequency?

568
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,940
3265千赫
Khz 3265.

569
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,730
當地人用什么語言交流
What language are they speaking?

570
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,040
葡萄牙語

梅花八
Eight of clubs.

573
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:46,990

574
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,230
黑桃J
Jack of spades?

575
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,630
拼出她的姓
Spell her last name.

576
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:00,160
B-a-c-z-e-w-s-k-i  比謝夫斯基
Uh, B-a-c-z-e-w-s-k-i. Baczewski.

577
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,040
這上面說她比誰還火辣
It says here she's hotter than what?

578
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,980
-喬治婭·阿斯法特  -誰說的

579
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,380
電影《我心狂野》

對賽勒· 黎普列說的

582
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,690
全中
Fucking-a right.

583
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,550
你和她之間有什么故事
So, you guys got something going on?

584
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:27,930
沒有
No.

585
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,160
得了吧
Come on, man,

586
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,110
從她打量你的眼神就能看出端倪
I've seen the way she's checking you out

587
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,610
你當時沒在看她
when you're not looking.

588
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,740
真的沒什么
There's nothing.

589
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,090
真的
Seriously?

590
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,370
真的
Seriously.

591
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,330
這么說你不介意
So, you don't mind if I...

592
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,970
我去泡她了
If I hit that shit then, right?

593
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,200
你看  還說沒什么
See? There is something.

594
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,490
我就知道
I knew it.

595
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,110
真的沒什么  你盡管去
No, go ahead. Really.

596
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,110
我只是和你開玩笑
Nah, man, I'm just fucking with you.

597
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,990
我結婚了

598
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,830
剛有了第一個孩子

599
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,750
是個男孩
It's a boy.

600
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,580
他叫德文
Name's Devon.

601
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,960
你怎么從來沒提過
How come I didn't know that?

602
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,670
因為我
Just...

603
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,840
不太愿意談及我的家庭
I don't like talking about my family.

604
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,300
迷信使然
Superstitious.

605
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:19,250
五分鐘后開會
Hey, we're on in five.

606
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,600
在簡報室
In the briefing room.

607
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:27,080
這一帶區域的伊朗巡邏隊并非全天候執勤
Iranian patrols in the area are intermittent.

608
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,690
但訓練有素  裝備精良
But they are well-trained and equipped.

609
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,230
此外  離這里七十英里處的畢扎爾
Also, there is also an IRIAF base

610
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:34,160
是伊朗的空軍基地
in Bijar, 70 miles away,

611
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,150
換句話說  隨時可以調配空中火力支持
which means they can call in air support.

612
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,600
他們都有什么飛機
What kind of planes are we talking?

613
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:40,350
有幾架是兩伊戰爭時期
Uh, some French-built F-1 Mirages impounded

614
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:42,150
從伊拉克收繳的法國F-1幻影戰斗機
from Iraq after the First Gulf War

615
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,830
還有六架中國制造的蘇24戰斗機
and six Chinese Su-24s.

616
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:45,730
不好意思  可以回到剛才的問題嗎
Excuse me, can we back up a minute?

617
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:46,860
可以
Sure.

618
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,460
他們押送我至邊境處
The guys gets me to the border...

619
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,700
然后我示意投降
where I surrender myself?

620
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,820
沒錯
Correct.

621
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,960
選擇馬里萬郡是因為很多基地組織指揮官
We chose Marivan because several Al-Qaeda commanders

622
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,150
同樣在那里尋求政治庇護
also asked for political asylum there.

623
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,930
之后呢  等人空載我去德黑蘭
What happens then? I get flown to Tehran?

624
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,270
經過一段時間審查之后  我們的預期是那樣的
After a period of vetting, yeah, that's our expectation.

625
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:05,320
好的  你憑什么認為我能夠接近
Okay, but what makes you think I'll ever get close enough

626
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,480
阿克巴里將軍并完成刺殺
to General Akbari to take him out?

627
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,770
你將受到革命英雄的待遇
You'll be treated as a hero of the revolution.

628
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,130
很多高級官員  比如將軍
The senior members of the regime, like the general,

629
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,870
會迫不及待想利用你的宣傳價值
want to take advantage of your propaganda value.

630
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,370
而且賈瓦迪將作為引薦人
Plus Javadi's on the ground

631
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:19,440
安排你和將軍的會面
to facilitate a meeting between the two of you.

632
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,100
但如果不知道暗殺行動結束的時間地點的話
But if we don't know where or when the assassination goes down...?

633
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,660
你是在擔心撤離計劃
You're concerned about our extraction plan.

634
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,960
任務完成之后  該如何全身而退
How we're gonna get you out of there once it's done?

635
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,220
是的
Yeah.

636
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,290
我正準備說
I was just getting to that.

637
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,670
你一進入邊境
Once you're inserted at the border,

638
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:32,700
隨行隊伍里的四名人員
four members of your team

639
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,020
會沿路南上儂得衫
will continue south to Nodesheh,

640
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,480
之后翻山越嶺  穿過平原
where they cross the mountains and make their way overland

641
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:38,810
行軍至拉溫莎
to Lavasan,

642
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:41,230
德黑蘭外圍的一個小城市
a small city just outside Tehran.

643
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,730
那里有當地的反叛組織
Opposition groups there have provided us

644
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,160
提供的安全屋
with a safe house.

645
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,780
我們領先一步
We've already gone ahead

646
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:49,360
安全衛星通信設備已安裝完畢
and put in secure satcom.

647
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,260
碰頭暗號是
Our code there is...

648
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,060
[波斯語]

649
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,750
[波斯語]

650
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,420
你從什么時候開始抽煙的
Since when do you smoke?

651
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,710
我不抽
I don't.

652
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,580
我沒在抽
I'm not.

653
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,680
只是裝個樣子
It just looks like I'm smoking.

654
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,990
瞧  就當沒發生過
There. It never happened.

655
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,210
你什么也沒看見
You saw nothing.

656
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,460
什么也沒有
Nothing.

657
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:35,480
話說...
Look...

658
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:37,110
我照你說的做了
I did what you asked.

659
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:38,800
按你的意愿行事
I'm doing what you want.

660
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,220
現在該帶我去見丹娜了
Now you told me you'd take me to see Dana again.

661
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,830
我是說等你回來以后
I meant after you get back.

662
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,110
算了吧  卡莉
Come on, Carrie.

663
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,420
你我都知道此行兇多吉少
We both know that's a long shot.

664
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,220
這么多風雨都熬過來了
We made it this far.

665
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,110
這倒是
That's true.

666
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,460
我承認  我有過懷疑
I admit, I had my doubts.

667
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,590
所以你才刻意保持距離吧
Is that why you've kept your distance?

668
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,880
沒關系的
Hey, it's fine.

669
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:11,280
這是你的權利
You're entitled.

670
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,790
六小時后你就要出發了
You're loading out in six hours.

671
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:23,100
我不知道能否及時把你送回基地
I'm not sure I can get you off the base and back in time.

672
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,000
不見到丹娜  我是不會走的
Well, I'm not leaving until I see Dana again.

673
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,170
在119號房間
It's there. 119.

674
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:53,300
布洛迪  有些事我得告訴你
Brody, there's something you need to know.

675
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,370
在丹娜更改姓氏
Before she changed her name,

676
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:58,720
離家出走之前
before she left home...

677
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,800
她在醫院待過一陣
Dana was hospitalized.

678
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:07,480
在爆炸案發生后兩周后
About two weeks after the bombing...

679
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,420
她曾企圖自殺
she tried to kill herself.

680
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,680
誰啊
Who is it?

681
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:45,300
丹娜  是我
Dana, it's me.

682
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,030
是爸爸
It's your dad.

683
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,630
你是怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

684
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,030
有卡莉幫忙
Carrie.

685
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:57,600
我能進去嗎
Can I come in?

686
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,600
拜托了  丹娜
Dana, please?

687
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,310
謝謝
Thank you.

688
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,410
我一定得見你
I had to see you.

689
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,670
好吧
Okay.

690
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:32,980
你見到了
You have.

691
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,640
親愛的  我真的很抱歉
Oh, my baby, I'm so sorry.

692
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,430
沒這個必要
Don't be.

693
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,400
你現在過得還好嗎
How are you now?

694
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,130
你到底來干什么
Why are you here?

695
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:05,980
我只是想告訴你
I just wanted to tell you that

696
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,130
那些人指責我干的那些事情  我是被冤枉的
all those things those people said I did, I didn't do.

697
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,030
好的
Fine.

698
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:11,290
好的  很好
Fine, good.

699
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,470
那些人不是我殺的
I didn't kill all those people.

700
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,390
不是我
It wasn't me.

701
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:17,960
不是我干的
I didn't do it.

702
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,720
我馬上要走了
And I have to leave soon.

703
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:29,900
幾小時后就走
In a few hours.

704
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:38,240
我只是想在臨走前見見你
But I just wanted to see you before I go.

705
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,650
你見到了
You did.

706
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:48,380
你就從來沒想過
Did you ever, for one second,

707
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,300
我是不是想見到你呢
think about if I wanted to see you?

708
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,170
你想聽我說什么
What do you want to hear?

709
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,930
說你是好爸爸嗎
That you were a good dad?

710
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:05,620
無論發生什么事  都沒關系嗎
That despite everything, it's all okay?

711
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:08,250
你想讓我說什么
What do you want me to say?

712
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,370
這樣吧
Look...

713
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,920
拿去
Look, here...

714
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:17,580
拿張紙寫下來
Here, just write it down.

715
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:20,970
你寫什么我就說什么
Really, just write it down and I will say it to you...

716
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,690
只要你答應
as long as you promise

717
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:25,860
再也別讓我見到你了
I will never have to see you again.

718
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:34,990
你們倆都是
Either of you.

719
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,520
我會從德黑蘭回來的
I will come back from Tehran.

720
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,360
我知道
I know you will.

721
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:21,820
不只是為了她
And not just for her.

722
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,720
你們他媽的去哪了
Where the fuck were you?

723
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,810
他想找人談心
He wanted to talk.

724
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:04,840
還有四十五分鐘他就要出發了
He's got 45 minutes to load out.

725
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,650
他準備就緒了
He's all set.

726
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,220
你把他帶出基地了
You took him off base.

727
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,730
他威脅說不干了  索爾
He threatened to pull out, Saul.

728
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:16,820
出去可能會發生各種意外
Anything could've happened out there.

729
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,150
可是沒發生
But it didn't.

730
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,910
我真他媽對你無語了
I am truly at a fuckin' loss with you.

731
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,490
能有點信心嗎  索爾
Have a little faith, Saul.

732
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:27,750
兩周前  你根本沒法實施行動
Two weeks ago, there was no operation.

733
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,720
因為我  現在才得以行動
Now there is, because of me.

734
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:32,500
我真心希望你能明白這點
I really need you to get that.

735
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,710
為了讓本次行動成功
Because in order for us to pull this thing off,

736
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:36,720
我們必須得想個辦法
we're gonna have to find a way

737
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,210
重新建立彼此間的信任
to trust each other again.

738
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,280
或者想個好辦法假裝互相信任
Or at least come up with a really great plan for faking it.

739
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,890
布洛迪
Brody...

740
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,180
到那邊再見
See you on the other side.
