1
00:00:00,364 --> 00:00:02,594
混沌初世，一片黑暗
male narrator: In the beginning, there was darkness,

2
00:00:02,662 --> 00:00:04,497
然后爆炸
and then, bang,

3
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:07,377
产生了无边无际的
giving birth to an endless expanding existence

4
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:09,418
时间、空间和物质
of time, space, and matter.

5
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:13,459
有一个地方，每天都有新发现
Every day, new discoveries are unlocking the mysterious,

6
00:00:13,486 --> 00:00:15,959
但它依然极端神秘，让人饶有兴趣
the mind-blowing, the deadly secrets

7
00:00:15,986 --> 00:00:18,845
它就是宇宙
of a place we call The Universe.

8
00:00:21,374 --> 00:00:25,432
在宇宙里，了解最靠近你的邻居很重要
In the universe, it's important to know your nearest neighbors.

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,583
可是对我们这个银河角落
But how much do we really know about our corner

10
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,027
我们真正了解多少？
of the Milky Way?

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,596
就在几年前
In just the last few years,

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,277
科学家发现了潜藏在我们后院的
scientists have uncovered incredible secrets

13
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,485
惊人秘密：
lurking in our own backyard:

14
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:44,694
新卫星，新行星以及新奥秘
new moons, new planets, and new mysteries.

15
00:00:45,444 --> 00:00:47,277
这就象你的邻居有一座房子
- It's like there was a house in your neighborhood

16
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,068
但你从不知道
that you never knew was there.

17
00:00:49,388 --> 00:00:50,916
你会遇到一些
narrator: Meet new neighbors

18
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:53,174
恰好经过的新邻居
who are just passing through...

19
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:56,916
有些行星在银河里漫无目的地流浪
- There are planets that are wandering the galaxy aimlessly

20
00:00:57,027 --> 00:00:58,679
没有自己的家
without a place to call home.

21
00:00:59,443 --> 00:01:00,721
而有些老朋友
narrator: And old friends

22
00:01:00,902 --> 00:01:02,554
则时日无多
whose days are numbered.

23
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,471
相信参宿四会在今晚
- It's conceivable that Betelgeuse

24
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:06,124
演进为超新星
will go supernova tonight.

25
00:01:06,263 --> 00:01:08,401
让我们展开旅程
narrator: Join us for a tour of the neighborhood

26
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:10,540
现在就去认识这个地区
we're only now getting to know.

27
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:14,526
它就是“银河里的我们地区”
This is "Our Place in the Milky Way."

29
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,943
宇宙：银河里的我们地区

30
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:30,443
这不是你的地区
This isn't your neighborhood,

31
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:33,109
不论是这个
neither is this

32
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:34,332
还是这个
or this

33
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:36,443
或这些的任何一个
or any of these.

34
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:39,776
甚至这个也不是
And it isn't even this.

35
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:45,290
从广义来说
Looked at from a wider perspective,

36
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:48,498
你的地区是一团巨大的气体云
your neighborhood is a big cloud of gas.

37
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:51,762
天文学家把
Astronomers say the solar system 

38
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,665
太阳系正在穿越的本星际云
is moving through the local interstellar cloud,

39
00:01:55,345 --> 00:01:57,447
也称为“本地绒毛”
also called "the local fluff"

40
00:01:57,678 --> 00:02:00,803
因为它密度低且形状不规则
because of its low density and irregular shape.

41
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:05,782
气体主要是氢，以及一些氦
- The gases are mainly hydrogen and some helium.

42
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:08,803
还有微量的较重的原子
There are trace amounts of heavier atoms

43
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:11,295
比如在星际介质边缘漂浮着的
like carbon and oxygen and nitrogen

44
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:14,039
碳、氧和氮
that are just floating around the interstellar medium.

45
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:18,734
我们知道，星际介质里较重的原子
We know that the heavier atoms in the interstellar medium

46
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:20,817
是超新星之类的恒星
are left over from 

47
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:24,466
发生爆炸而遗留下来的
previous explosions of stars as supernovae.

48
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:29,456
本星际云团长达30光年
narrator: The local fluff is 30 light-years long,

49
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,845
大约是180万亿英里
about 180 trillion miles.

50
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:36,039
它位于一个被称为“本地泡”的烟囱状
It's inside a larger chimney-shaped gas cloud

51
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,692
巨大气体云内部
called the local bubble,

52
00:02:37,844 --> 00:02:40,622
那也是一个古老的超新星遗留下来的
also the remnant of an ancient supernova.

53
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:44,094
本地泡长300光年
The bubble is 300 light-years long

54
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:49,553
位于银河一个旋臂的内缘
and lies in the inner edge of one of the spiral arms of the Milky Way.

56
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:52,998
这就是我们的地区
And that's our neighborhood.

57
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:55,261
至少，我们认为它是
At least, we think it is.

58
00:02:56,247 --> 00:02:58,691
我们在银河系里的精确位置
- Our exact position in the Milky Way galaxy

59
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,358
与某些未知的臂有关
relative to the arms actually isn't known.

60
00:03:02,205 --> 00:03:05,886
银河的构造难以说清
The structure of the galaxy is not known in any real detail.

61
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:08,483
一些人认为有两个主臂
Some people think there are two major arms.

62
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:10,858
有人认为有四个主臂
Some people think there are four major arms.

63
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,066
我们难以确定
It's hard for us to determine

64
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:15,313
我们银河的精确结构
the exact structure of our Milky Way,

65
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:17,608
这些臂在哪里等等
where all the arms are and so on,

66
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:21,094
因为如同迷宫里的老鼠
because it's kind of like a mouse being inside a maze.

67
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:24,200
你不能掌控全局
You don't get the big picture.

68
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:27,912
在地球上，在任意地区
narrator: In almost any Earth neighborhood,

69
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:31,149
你都能非常精确地确定位置
you can determine your location very precisely.

70
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:34,524
30英尺后转左
- Turn left in 30 feet.

71
00:03:39,774 --> 00:03:41,066
但是，当面对银河
narrator: But when you're dealing with something

72
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:42,746
这样的庞然大物时
as big as the Milky Way,

73
00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:47,565
GPS就不行了
GPS isn't an option.

74
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:52,690
银河的跨度为100,000光年
- The galaxy is, you know, 100,000 light-years across.

75
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,621
即使是在我们地区探索
narrator: Even exploring our local neighborhood

76
00:03:57,635 --> 00:03:59,412
也有许多的不确定
involves a lot of uncertainty.

77
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,107
但如果有银河坐标系统
But if we did have a galactic positioning system,

78
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,315
也许能让我们在银河的
it would probably locate us about midway between

79
00:04:08,343 --> 00:04:10,676
顶部和底部之间
the top and bottom of the Milky Way

80
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:15,968
以及内外缘之间
and about midway between the galaxy's outer edge

81
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:17,398
进行定位
and inner core.

82
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,121
我们太阳系离银河中心
- Our solar system is about 26,000 light-years away

83
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:23,829
大约26,000光年
from the center of our galaxy.

84
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,805
根据一个假说，我们拥有
narrator: According to one hypothesis,

85
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,481
一个非常独特的位置
we have a very exclusive location.

86
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,940
有一种看法认为，只有在
- There is one idea that only stars in a certain range

87
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:35,481
恒星与银河中心的距离为某一范围时
of distances from the center of our galaxy

88
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,759
它才在所谓的银河适宜居住区之内
are in the so-called galactic habitable zone,

89
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:41,926
这就是说，环绕这些恒星旋转的行星
that is, able to have life on planets

90
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,634
才能拥有生命
surrounding those stars.

91
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:47,759
它正是这样的好地方
- It is just the right place

92
00:04:47,773 --> 00:04:49,578
有温度适宜的恒星
with a star of the right temperature

93
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:51,398
行星恰好位于
and a planet at the right distance

94
00:04:51,578 --> 00:04:54,158
表面能有许多液态水的距离上
for there to be a lot of liquid water on the surface,

95
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:58,287
生命化学物质出现并演化成我们人类
where the chemistry of life began and evolved into us.

96
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:02,439
整个的银河适宜居住地带
narrator: The overall range of the galactic habitable zone

97
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:07,023
从距离银河中心13,000光年的地方延伸到
extends from about 13,000 to 35,000 light-years

98
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:08,842
35,000光年的地方
from the center of the Milky Way.

99
00:05:09,578 --> 00:05:11,314
主要的部分，是我们的所在地
The main part, where we are,

100
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:15,828
处于距离中心20,000至29,000光年的范围内
ranges from 20,000 to 29,000 light-years from the core.

101
00:05:18,397 --> 00:05:19,925
在这个地带里
Inside the zone,

102
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:24,814
旧区的消亡
old neighborhoods have been destroyed

103
00:05:25,272 --> 00:05:28,508
造就了一个我们称为家园的地方
to make a place we can call home.

104
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:30,939
受观察角度的影响
- Depending upon how you look at things,

105
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:33,592
如果从全局去观察宇宙
our local neighborhood, our local solar system,

106
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:37,050
与看起来将要发生的事来作比较，你可以认为
is actually a relatively safe place

107
00:05:37,175 --> 00:05:39,703
我们这个地区，我们太阳系
compared to what seems to be going on

108
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:42,966
是一个相对安全的地方
if you look at the universe in the large.

109
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,786
但在太阳系的早期
In the early history of our solar system,

110
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:48,803
它是非常动荡的地方
it was a much more violent place.

111
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,313
构成太阳和行星的物质
And the material that formed the Sun and the planets

112
00:05:52,327 --> 00:05:54,522
还在忙着安顿自己
was still sorting itself out.

113
00:05:54,744 --> 00:05:56,411
五花八门的碰撞
There were all sorts of collisions

114
00:05:56,438 --> 00:05:58,855
层出不穷的动乱
and violent things happening

115
00:05:58,883 --> 00:06:00,883
形成了我们今天这个
that gave rise to this nice, calm-

116
00:06:00,897 --> 00:06:03,355
美好、平静或者说是相对平静的地方
or relatively calm place that we have today.

117
00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:08,369
我们认为最早的恒星
- We think that the earliest stars formed

118
00:06:08,397 --> 00:06:10,369
只由氢和氮所构成
out of hydrogen and helium alone,

119
00:06:10,549 --> 00:06:14,022
但是，在长年累月之后，这些恒星
but that, over time, the stars work as these processors

120
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:16,202
不断产生重元素
that create the heavier elements.

121
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,174
这一点至关重要，因为当这些恒星
This is important because when those stars

122
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:21,211
最终死亡和爆炸时
eventually die and explode,

123
00:06:21,605 --> 00:06:24,382
这些超新星或死亡星球的爆炸
these supernovae, or stellar death explosions,

124
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:27,410
为银河和周围的物质
seed the galaxy and the material around it

125
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:29,244
带来了重元素
with heavier elements.

126
00:06:30,785 --> 00:06:33,132
比方说，我们细胞里的碳
- So for example, the carbon in our cells,

127
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:35,632
呼吸的氧
the oxygen that we breathe,

128
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:38,091
骨头里的钙
the calcium in our bones,

129
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,799
红细胞里的铁
the iron in our red blood cells,

130
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,399
所有这些都是重元素
all those are heavy elements.

131
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:48,604
我们知道
- We know that the Sun

132
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:50,896
太阳至少是第二、三代的恒星
is at least a second- or a third-generation star

133
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:52,674
因为有许多行星围绕着它
because there are planets around it.

134
00:06:52,688 --> 00:06:55,715
有许多由铁、碳和其它重元素构成的东西
There are things made of iron and carbon and other heavier elements.

135
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,618
但是，造就地球生命的过程
narrator: But the processes that led to life on Earth

136
00:07:00,743 --> 00:07:03,354
在这个地带之外似乎看不到
don't seem to exist outside the zone.

137
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,229
紧挨银河边缘的地方
Closer to the edge of the galaxy,

138
00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:08,842
有几个大恒星已经爆炸
fewer massive stars have exploded,

139
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:11,451
产生了不太多的重元素
producing fewer heavy elements.

140
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:13,701
在银河外层较远的地方
- Further out in the galaxy,

141
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:18,520
你找不到象碳、氮和氧
you don't have as many atoms like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen-

142
00:07:18,632 --> 00:07:22,139
这些对生命化学物质非常重要的原子
the atoms that are so important for the chemistry of life.

143
00:07:24,298 --> 00:07:26,439
所以，银河适宜居住地带
So the habitable zone of the galaxy

144
00:07:26,742 --> 00:07:29,048
以是否拥有构成生命的重元素
cuts off at a distance where you just won't have

145
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:30,812
作为分界线
the heavier atoms to make life.

146
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:36,199
如果银河外层是不好的地区
narrator: If the outer galaxy is a bad neighborhood,

147
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,159
那么内层有过之而无不及
the inner area is even worse.

148
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:44,187
巨大气体行星的大质量产生的万有引力
Gravity from massive gas giant planets

149
00:07:44,201 --> 00:07:45,909
能够把我们撕碎
could tear us apart.

150
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,520
而且，如果再靠近银河中心
And there are other dangers the closer you get

151
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:51,187
还会有其它危险
to the galactic core.

152
00:07:52,298 --> 00:07:54,020
在哥白尼时代
- Back in the times of Copernicus,

153
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,506
我们自认是宇宙的中心
we thought that we were the center of our universe,

154
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:59,450
甚至在开始进一步研究天空的时候
and even as we started to learn more about the heavens,

155
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:02,659
人们最终还是认为自己是银河的中心
eventually, we still thought that we were the center of the galaxy.

156
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:04,506
现在我们知道得更多了
Now that we know even more, though,

157
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,034
但是，我们应当庆幸
it actually turns out that we're lucky

158
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:08,006
我们不是在银河的中心
we're not in the center of the galaxy.

159
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:10,839
在银河中心
narrator: At the center of the Milky Way,

160
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:13,381
人马座A星正在疯狂吞噬物质
sucking matter and even light into it,

161
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:15,742
即使是光也会被吸进去
is Sagittarius A-Star,

162
00:08:15,922 --> 00:08:20,033
它是跨度接近一千四百万英里的一个黑洞
a black hole nearly 14 million miles across

163
00:08:20,256 --> 00:08:24,255
质量是太阳的370万倍
with a mass 3.7 million times that of our Sun.

164
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,880
如果银河中心有一个黑洞在里面
- If the galactic center has a black hole in it,

165
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:30,742
它会放射出大量的辐射
it gives off a lot of radiation-

166
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:33,589
-足以摧毁生命-
enough to fry life as we know it-

167
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:35,991
所以你不能太靠近它
so you can't be too close to that.

168
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:39,505
此外，在银河里
Then there are other regions in the galaxy

169
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,186
也有其它不太有利于生命的区域
that are also probably not so great for life

170
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:44,880
因为那里有非常大量的
because there's just so much radiation

171
00:08:44,977 --> 00:08:48,894
从附近炽热的O-型星传来的辐射
from nearby really hot O-type stars.

172
00:08:50,574 --> 00:08:52,942
O-型星是宇宙巨人
narrator: O-type stars are giants.

173
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:54,936
它们比太阳更热
They're hotter than the Sun,

174
00:08:55,047 --> 00:08:57,463
质量是太阳的10至50倍
10 to 50 times as massive,

175
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,824
会释放出非常大量的紫外线
and throw out titanic amounts of ultraviolet radiation.

176
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:05,291
面对这些恒星，你要担心的不是晒伤
With these stars, you don't worry about sunburn

177
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:07,296
而是毁灭
but extinction.

178
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:11,783
大量O-型星簇拥着你
- It's probably not easy to survive in an environment

179
00:09:11,796 --> 00:09:15,135
这样的环境，恐怕你不能轻易存活
where you're in a tight cluster with a lot of O-type stars.

180
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:21,796
O-型巨星能够在行星形成之前
narrator: O-type giants can destroy planets

181
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,407
就摧毁它们
before they form.

182
00:09:24,074 --> 00:09:26,671
这些恒星的辐射如此之强
- The radiation from these stars is so strong

183
00:09:26,838 --> 00:09:30,213
可以从即将成形的行星那里
that it actually sweeps the material away

184
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:33,727
把物质扫走
from these newly forming, would-be planetary systems

185
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,921
并从它们的恒星轨道上狠狠抛出去
and rips it out of the orbit of their stars.

186
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:43,393
如果你需要证明，那就看看玫瑰星云吧
narrator: If you want proof, look at the Rosette nebula.

187
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:49,365
它离本地泡非常远，相隔5,200光年
It's 5,200 light-years away, far outside the local bubble,

188
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:54,750
但它能展示O-型星会为我们地区带来什么影响
but it shows what O-type giants could do to our neighborhood.

189
00:09:56,712 --> 00:09:59,698
2008年亚利桑那州的一份研究表明
A 2008 study by the University of Arizona

190
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:01,796
在星云中发现有1,000个恒星
of 1,000 stars in the nebula

191
00:10:02,004 --> 00:10:04,851
因为太靠近蓝巨星
found star after star had been made barren

192
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:07,837
而成为不毛之地
by being too close to a blue giant.

193
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:11,226
那么，对于O-型巨星的辐射
So what's a safe distance from the radiation

194
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,045
距离多远才安全呢？
of an O-type giant?

195
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:15,740
如果你问我
- Well, if you ask me,

196
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:18,184
我会说，你到哪里都没用
you can never be too far away from a giant.

197
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,615
但如果你象我们地球生命
If you're life like us here on Earth-

198
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:23,948
习惯了温顺的太阳一样习惯了它
we're used to our fairly tame Sun-

199
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:27,781
你还得距离它至少数十光年
you want to be probably at least tens of light-years away,

200
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:29,420
或许比这还远
maybe more than that.

201
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:31,920
真的，别太近
Really, just don't get too close.

202
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:38,267
正如沙漠与海洋之间的城市
narrator: Like a city between a desert and an ocean,

203
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:40,934
我们这个银河角落在两个不同的
our corner of the galaxy thrives

204
00:10:40,948 --> 00:10:44,309
不适宜居住地带之间繁荣发展
between two different inhospitable regions.

205
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:47,642
拥有生命的力量
With the elements of life

206
00:10:47,656 --> 00:10:50,059
却没有强辐射的威胁
and without the threat of intense radiation,

207
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:52,197
看起来我们地区
it seems like our neighborhood

208
00:10:52,211 --> 00:10:54,767
似乎是唯一能居住的地方
is literally the only place to live.

209
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,045
但我们这个地方在银河里
But is our place in the Milky Way

210
00:10:58,059 --> 00:10:59,864
真的独一无二？
really so exclusive?

211
00:11:00,697 --> 00:11:02,753
关于银河适宜居住地带的看法是
- The idea of the galactic habitable zone is that

212
00:11:02,781 --> 00:11:05,003
如果太靠近银河中心
if you're too close to the center of the galaxy,

213
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,725
那里的极端环境
there's all these crazy things going on,

214
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:08,281
会扼杀生命
and it tends to kill off life.

215
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,975
坦白说，我很怀疑这个观点
To be honest, I'm personally skeptical of the idea

216
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:12,197
我认为生命会发生在
because I think that life can happen

217
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:13,572
各种环境里
in all sorts of environments,

218
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:15,497
退一步来说，在不确切的情况下
or at the very least, we don't know,

219
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:17,406
我们要放开思想
so we should be open-minded.

220
00:11:18,183 --> 00:11:19,989
可能我们这种生命
It's possible that our kind of life

221
00:11:20,003 --> 00:11:22,461
只能在这个银河宜居地带生活
can only live in this galactic habitable zone,

222
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:24,433
但会有我们称为极端生物的
but elsewhere, there could be other kinds of life

223
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:26,322
其它种类的生命在别处
that we would call extremophiles.

224
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:29,181
反过来，他们会把我们称为极端生物
On the other hand, they would call us extremophiles.

225
00:11:33,488 --> 00:11:35,002
有一件事是必然的
narrator: One thing is certain.

226
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:38,252
在我们地区，我们有一个
In our neighborhood, we have a sun that,

227
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:40,322
与蓝巨星不同的太阳
unlike a blue giant,

228
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:42,988
以我们尚在研究的各种方式
protects us from danger and destruction

229
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,683
来保护我们免受危险和毁灭
in ways that we're still learning about.

230
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:49,474
它的保护可能是隐形的
That protection may be invisible,

231
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:53,118
如果失去太阳的保护
but if we lose the Sun's protection,

232
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:56,933
我们地区的末日就会降临
our neighborhood could be doomed.

233
00:12:00,544 --> 00:12:03,849
在银河里的我们这个地方，似乎相当安宁
Our place in the Milky Way seems pretty peaceful

234
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:07,155
因为，就象许多社区
because, like a lot of communities,

235
00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:12,321
坏人被24小时工作的保安系统拒之门外了
we don't give much thought to the 24/7 security systems

236
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:14,529
我们不需要大伤脑筋
that keep the bad stuff away.

237
00:12:16,557 --> 00:12:19,238
许多在河畔或海滨的城市
Many cities on the edges of rivers or oceans

238
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:22,585
组织人力物力去建筑堤坝，以防止洪灾
have dams and levies to protect them from floods.

239
00:12:23,196 --> 00:12:25,168
如果堤坝不行
If the dams and levies fail-

240
00:12:26,654 --> 00:12:28,043
灾难就会降临
disaster.

241
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:34,168
银河系里的我们，也是威胁与保护共存
We've got threats and defenses on a galactic scale too.

242
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:39,154
--太空充斥着被称为宇宙射线的辐射
- Space is filled with radiation known as cosmic rays.

243
00:12:39,696 --> 00:12:41,932
宇宙射线对我们的危害程度
Cosmic rays are bad for us in the same sense

244
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,057
等同于地球上的核辐射
that nuclear radiation here on Earth would be bad for us,

245
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:48,793
因为高能辐射
because high-energy radiation

246
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:50,946
会让构成我们人类的
tends to dissociate carbon bonds,

247
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,487
碳化合物分离
which is what we're made of.

248
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:55,071
你的DNA会被破坏
What you're really doing is damaging your DNA,

249
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,612
而且有可能
and there's a potential there

250
00:12:56,626 --> 00:12:59,640
因此而开始产生变异
that you could start to have mutations based off of that.

251
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:04,487
变异会帮助物种生存
narrator: Some mutations can help a species survive

252
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:07,834
也会导致它灭绝
or lead to extinction.

253
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,459
没有证据表明
- There's no evidence that cosmic radiation

254
00:13:11,473 --> 00:13:14,348
宇宙辐射过去曾对地球有负面影响
has really negatively impacted Earth in the past,

255
00:13:14,473 --> 00:13:16,390
但你不能视之为无物
but it's nothing that you want to play around with.

256
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:19,154
我们对抗宇宙射线的
narrator: Our neighborhood's prime defense

257
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,806
有力防御是
against cosmic rays:

258
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:23,195
磁力
magnetism.

259
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:27,764
这是我们的防御带
- We have this zone of protection in our neighborhood.

260
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:30,917
当然，地球拥有磁场
Of course, the Earth has a magnetic field

261
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:34,542
归功于地核内的事物如何运动
due to how things move around in the core of the Earth.

262
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:37,209
太阳也有一个强大的磁场
The Sun also has a powerful magnetic field,

263
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:38,917
也因此而拥有太阳风
and it also has the solar wind.

264
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:44,070
这些现象形成了对我们的各种保护
These phenomena actually generate ways of protecting us

265
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:47,042
避免从太阳系外面而来的侵害
from things that come from outside the solar system.

266
00:13:51,403 --> 00:13:53,556
太阳磁场被太阳风
narrator: The Sun's magnetic field is twisted

267
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,514
扭曲
by the solar wind,

268
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,917
带电质子和电子源源不断地
streams of charged protons and electrons

269
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,361
以一百万英里的时速从太阳发射出来
that shoot out of the Sun at a million miles an hour.

270
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,375
于是，太阳系行星之间的微粒
- And then the particles that live in the solar system between the planets

271
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,458
沿着周围的磁力线
actually stretch the lines of the magnetic field around

272
00:14:11,472 --> 00:14:12,875
形成复杂的图案
in complicated patterns.

273
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:19,041
携带磁场的太阳风
narrator: The solar wind carries the magnetic field

274
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:21,139
比海王星轨道的三倍
more than three times farther out

275
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,833
还要长
than the orbit of Neptune.

276
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,487
然而，在90亿英里外
But 9 billion miles away,

277
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,041
在一个被称为“太阳驻点”的地方
at a place called the heliopause,

278
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:34,513
太阳风失去动力，几乎没有速度
the solar wind runs out of steam and slows to almost nothing.

279
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:40,027
在慢下来时，它扭曲太阳磁场成为一道屏障
As it slows, it twists the Sun's magnetic field

280
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:42,555
抵挡从星际空间而来的
into a barrier against cosmic rays

281
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:44,249
宇宙射线
from interstellar space.

282
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,417
这个区域被称为“日鞘”
This is the heliosheath.

283
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:52,374
如果没有日鞘
- If it wasn't for the heliosheath,

284
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:56,527
宇宙射线会一直不停地涌入我们太阳系
these cosmic rays would actually pour into our solar system all the time.

285
00:14:56,943 --> 00:15:00,193
对这些可能影响我们地球
The heliosheath acts as a kind of shark cage

286
00:15:00,582 --> 00:15:02,818
来势汹汹的宇宙射线
for these incoming cosmic rays

287
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,151
日鞘起着鲨鱼笼的作用
that might otherwise influence our planet.

288
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:08,938
有一些会穿过来
- Some do come through,

289
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:11,790
但不至于象没有这种保护一样
but they don't come through as strongly as they would

290
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:13,568
来得那么凶猛
without that protection.

291
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,193
人们一向认为
narrator: It used to be thought that the heliosheath

292
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:20,054
日鞘是由磁力垂帘构成的
was a rather elegant barrier

293
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:22,846
一道简单实用的屏障
made of flowing curtains of magnetic force,

294
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:25,346
但最近
but recently,

295
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:30,207
1977年从地球发射的太空船
enter Voyager 1 and Voyager 2,,

296
00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:34,760
旅行者1号和2号进入了该区域
probes sent out from Earth in 1977.

297
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:39,471
在21世纪早期
In the early 21st century,

298
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,832
这些70年代的设备发回的信息指出
these disco-era devices sent back information

299
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:47,387
太阳的磁力线
indicating that the Sun's magnetic field lines

300
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:49,274
不是光滑地连在一起的
don't flow smoothly together;

301
00:15:49,693 --> 00:15:53,776
它们间断开来，成为狂暴的磁泡
they break up and reform into violent magnetic froth,

302
00:15:54,206 --> 00:15:58,734
磁泡里的每一个泡宽一亿英里
and each bubble in that froth is 100 million miles wide.

303
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,512
通常认为，在它们之间是一道光滑、优雅的屏障
- We used to think that it was a smooth, nice barrier

304
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:03,790
但实际上
between them, but in fact,

305
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:06,623
那是躁动之地，有各种泡和其它形状的图案
it's a roiling place with all sorts of bubbles and patterns.

306
00:16:07,428 --> 00:16:09,456
我想，总有人把宇宙超乎自然地
I think there's always been people who think the universe

307
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,942
进行美化
is more elegant than it is

308
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:12,878
或是狂暴化
and people who think it's more violent than it is,

309
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:15,540
以至于我们总会惊讶于一面或其它面
and we're always surprised one way or the other.

310
00:16:15,678 --> 00:16:17,553
而真相是，宇宙有些方面
The truth is that some aspects of the universe

311
00:16:17,581 --> 00:16:19,331
非常美丽，但在别的方面
are quite elegant, and in other aspects,

312
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,817
它非常糟糕
it's quite a mess.

313
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:27,248
何处是我们银河地区的美丽地方
narrator: Where are the elegant areas of our galactic neighborhood,

314
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:29,147
何处是狂野之地？
and where are the rough parts?

315
00:16:31,664 --> 00:16:35,470
宇宙里的气体和尘埃让我们难以分辨
It can be hard to tell with all that gas and dust in the cosmos.

316
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,511
这有点象从这里看我身后的好莱坞
- It's sort of like looking here behind me at Hollywood.

317
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:41,928
那里有一个标志性建筑
There's even a landmark there,

318
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:43,456
“神殿唱片”大厦
the Capitol Records building.

319
00:16:43,595 --> 00:16:45,317
你能勉强地看到它
You can barely make it out.

320
00:16:45,553 --> 00:16:46,775
但在更远处
And even beyond that,

321
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:49,108
山岗就显得很模糊
there are some hills that are even hazier.

322
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:52,733
这是因为在空气中有东西妨碍了视线
It's because there's stuff in the air that blocks the view.

323
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:57,346
山岗本身还让我看不了更远
The hill itself obscures my ability to look beyond it,

324
00:16:57,747 --> 00:17:01,983
这有点象非常稠密的分子云中的尘埃
and that's kind of like the dust in very dense molecular clouds.

325
00:17:01,997 --> 00:17:04,941
充斥着尘埃的稠密的分子云构成一堵厚墙
When you hit a big wall of a dense molecular cloud

326
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:07,011
让你看不到任何东西
filled with dust, you can't see anything.

327
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:12,678
我们在探索银河地区时
narrator: When we explore our galactic neighborhood,

328
00:17:13,413 --> 00:17:16,691
所见依赖于我们怎样去看
what we see depends on how we look at things.

329
00:17:18,052 --> 00:17:21,094
通过观察天空，我们学到一个历史经验
- One of the things we've learned through the history of looking at the sky

330
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:24,038
任何时候，如果用不同方法去观察
is that every time you look in a different way,

331
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:25,344
你会看到新东西
you see new things,

332
00:17:25,816 --> 00:17:27,691
而用不同方法观察天空
and looking at the sky a different way

333
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:30,427
简单地说，往往是指
often simply means looking in a different part

334
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:32,373
使用不同的电磁波频谱
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

335
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:34,802
当我们用眼睛仰望天空
As we look up into the sky with our eyes

336
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:36,997
或是借助于光学望远镜
or with the aid of optical telescopes,

337
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:39,010
所利用的是光谱的可见部分
in the visible part of the spectrum,

338
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,010
我们对着夜空
we see the night sky,

339
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:42,830
会看到许多的事物
and there's a lot to see,

340
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:45,311
但这只是其中的一小部分
but it's only a fraction of what's out there.

341
00:17:49,191 --> 00:17:50,774
某些太空望远镜
narrator: Some space telescopes

342
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:54,163
利用红外线成像来穿透宇宙尘埃
see through cosmic dust with infrared vision,

343
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:58,357
其原理类似于民用红外摄像机
similar to that used by commercial infrared cameras.

344
00:17:59,218 --> 00:18:01,468
我带来了一个塑料袋
- I've brought with me this plastic bag,

345
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:03,982
当我把手放进袋子里
and when I put my hand inside of the bag,

346
00:18:04,732 --> 00:18:06,941
你看不到我竖起了多少个手指
you can't see how many fingers I'm holding up.

347
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:10,010
利用红外摄像机
With the infrared camera,

348
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:12,079
你能够看到我身体散发的热量
you can see the heat coming off my body,

349
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:14,885
我的脸部，比较暖和，呈红白色
so my face, which is warm, is red and white,

350
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:17,711
但是我的头发，比较低温，明显呈蓝色
but my hair, which is cool, shows up as blue.

351
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:20,593
因此，利用红外摄像机，你能辩认出
So with the infrared camera, you should be able to make out

352
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:22,246
我竖起了多少个手指
how many fingers I'm holding up,

353
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:25,121
哪怕你不能看穿这个塑料袋
even though you can't see through this bag.

354
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:28,732
这就是天文学家为什么能穿透宇宙尘埃
That's how astronomers peer through cosmic dust

355
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:31,412
去观察隐藏在视线之后的事物
when they want to see things that are hidden from sight.

356
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:35,426
例如，正在形成的恒星非常热
For example, stars being born are very warm,

357
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:37,996
但它们被尘埃遮蔽
but they're obscured by dust shells.

358
00:18:38,176 --> 00:18:40,301
利用红外线，我们就能看到它们
With infrared, we can see them.

359
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:45,993
某些物体透明或不透明
- Certain objects are transparent or opaque

360
00:18:46,454 --> 00:18:48,398
依赖于试图穿透它们的
depending upon the frequency of the light

361
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:49,870
光的频率
that's trying to get through them.

362
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:54,051
所以，在事实上，碍事的东西
And so, in fact, something that's getting in the way,

363
00:18:54,162 --> 00:18:56,690
比如诸多的星际尘埃或气体
like a lot of interstellar dust or gas,

364
00:18:56,704 --> 00:18:59,898
妨碍着望远镜的观测
is getting in the way of what your telescopes can see,

365
00:19:00,162 --> 00:19:03,495
但如果利用光谱的其它部分，那它们便化为无形
are actually invisible in another part of the spectrum.

366
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,106
你就能看到背后的东西
You can see what's behind.

367
00:19:07,342 --> 00:19:08,481
利用红外线
narrator: With infrared

368
00:19:08,495 --> 00:19:11,426
和诸多我们可以自由支配的其它波段
and a multitude of other wavelengths at our command,

369
00:19:11,676 --> 00:19:15,287
我们发现了许多我们过去不知道的邻居
we've discovered a lot of neighbors we didn't know we had.

370
00:19:16,301 --> 00:19:18,911
如果你能用光谱的一个特殊波段去看
- There's a whole array of instrumentation

371
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,731
你就能用一个非常特殊的方式去观察天空
which is exploiting that lesson that if you look

372
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,175
有一个仪器阵列
in a particular part of the spectrum,

373
00:19:24,203 --> 00:19:26,425
就是利用这个原理去工作的
you see the sky in a very particular way.

374
00:19:27,453 --> 00:19:28,967
从既往的研究来看
narrator: From what we've observed,

375
00:19:29,273 --> 00:19:31,467
在一些新邻居意欲
it looks like some old neighbors might have helped

376
00:19:31,495 --> 00:19:33,217
彻底摧毁我们的时候
life form on Earth,

377
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:37,175
似乎一些老邻居可能对地球生命的形成
while some newer neighbors may be planning

378
00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:38,856
有过帮助
to wipe us out.

379
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,842
在探索银河系里的我们这个地方时
As we've explored our place in the Milky Way,

380
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:50,758
我们曾遇到许多有趣的新邻居
we've met a lot of interesting new neighbors,

381
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,022
其中有好邻居，也有坏邻居
but there are good neighbors and bad ones.

382
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,994
好邻居是这样的物体，例如
- Good neighbors are, for example,

383
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:01,508
轨道稳定，有规律
objects that are in predictable orbits,

384
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:05,064
虽然走来走去，但只是在专心做自己的事
moving around, doing their own thing, minding their own business.

385
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:06,883
我们可以打量它们，朝它们挥手
We can look over and wave to them,

386
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:09,050
但它们不会对我们突然做什么事
but they're not gonna do something sudden

387
00:20:09,064 --> 00:20:10,577
不会危害我们
or dangerous to us.

388
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:12,216
而坏邻居
The bad neighbors, then,

389
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,772
会冷不防地搞一些动作
would be things that may do something unstable.

390
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,522
它们可能会做一些我们始料不及的事情
They may do something that could affect us

391
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:21,508
以某种方式来影响我们
in a way that we can't predict when it's going to happen.

392
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:26,827
这也许会发生在恒星死亡或爆炸的时候...
So that might be when a star dies and explodes...

393
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:32,744
或可能会发生在物体碰撞，然后一些别的东西
Or it might be when something collides and bounces off

394
00:20:32,758 --> 00:20:35,271
迅速反弹到我们这边来的时候
something else and comes spinning in our direction.

395
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:38,563
所以，好坏邻居的大致划分
So classifying things roughly into good neighbors

396
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:41,091
是按照是否具有
and bad neighbors is really a classification

397
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:44,466
预测性来确定的
into predictability and unpredictability,

398
00:20:44,632 --> 00:20:48,271
如果你喜欢，也可以用暴力和非暴力来划分
or violence and nonviolence if you like.

399
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,855
有时候，一个好邻居
narrator: Sometimes a good neighbor

400
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:52,743
会带来天外礼物
will bring a moving-in gift.

401
00:20:53,438 --> 00:20:56,521
对我们来说，这应该在数十亿年前发生过
That might have happened to us, billions of years ago,

402
00:20:56,813 --> 00:20:59,132
当其时，物质聚合为太阳
as the Earth was still cooling and forming

403
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:02,438
其剩余部分在形成地球并不断冷却
out of recycled material from a recycled sun.

404
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,257
我们可能接收了一个改变一切的礼物
We might have received a gift that changed everything.

405
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:14,701
早期的地球非常热
- The early Earth was very hot,

406
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:18,732
地表水很可能都蒸发掉了
and probably any original surface water evaporated away,

407
00:21:19,229 --> 00:21:21,049
所以我们认为，相当多的水
so we think that quite a bit of the water

408
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:25,402
可能来自于彗星或有冰的行星，或来自两者
may have come from either comets or icy asteroids or both.

409
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,479
关于地球怎么会得到这么多的水
- One of the theories about how we might have gotten

410
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:32,076
世上有许多理论
so much water here on Earth

411
00:21:32,284 --> 00:21:35,187
其中一个理论认为来自于外太阳系里的冰团
is from icy bodies in the outer solar system,

412
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:38,173
它们是构成太阳和行星的剩余物质
left over from the formation of the Sun and the planets,

413
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,562
冲入地球所在的内太阳系
crashing into our inner solar system where Earth lives

414
00:21:41,743 --> 00:21:43,395
带来了一部分的水
and deliver some of that water.

415
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:45,923
根据最近的一个理论
narrator: According to one recent theory,

416
00:21:46,131 --> 00:21:48,020
大约在40亿年前
about 4 billion years ago,

417
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:50,687
由于木星这些气态巨行星的万有引力
the gravity of gas giants like Jupiter

418
00:21:50,965 --> 00:21:55,242
许多有冰的小行星猛烈地撞击了火星、地球和金星
sent icy asteroids slamming into Mars, Earth, and Venus.

419
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:02,644
但只有在地球上的冰进入了地幔
But only on Earth did the ice penetrate into the mantle.

420
00:22:04,437 --> 00:22:06,270
水使得地球变软
The water softened the Earth

421
00:22:06,923 --> 00:22:11,114
开始了板块构造这个大工程
and initiated a titanic process of plate tectonics,

422
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:15,145
从而导致山岳和海洋的出现
which led to the emergence of continents and oceans.

423
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:22,478
这和在海洋中形成生命有什么关系呢？
And what of the life that formed in the oceans?

424
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:26,300
生命所必需的有机化合物
Did organic compounds necessary for life

425
00:22:26,672 --> 00:22:29,075
也是从天而降吗？
also splash down from space?

426
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:35,075
在罕见的碳质球粒陨石里，科学家找到的有机化合物
In rare meteorites called carbonaceous chondrites,

427
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:37,700
类似于曾帮助地球形成生命的
scientists have found organic compounds

428
00:22:37,714 --> 00:22:40,075
那些有机化合物
like those that helped form life on Earth.

429
00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:43,714
许多有机化合物的来源不同
These compounds are similar to what's been collected

430
00:22:43,728 --> 00:22:45,269
但这些都与它们很相似
from many different sources,

431
00:22:45,422 --> 00:22:47,714
包括南极洲微小陨石
including Antarctic micrometeorites,

432
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:49,103
星际尘埃
interstellar dust,

433
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:50,894
和美国宇航局2005年
and comet samples acquired

434
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:54,075
星尘任务所捕捉到的彗星样本
by NASA's Stardust mission in 2005.

435
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,353
生命的起源包含一长串的
- The origin of life involves a long series

436
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,227
许多不同有机分子的反应
of reactions with many different organic molecules,

437
00:23:00,408 --> 00:23:03,311
有机分子只含有一个碳分子
organic molecules being just ones with carbon in them,

438
00:23:03,547 --> 00:23:05,991
而且，可能需要不同环境去形成
and it's possible that different circumstances are needed

439
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:07,880
不同的有机化合物
to make the different organic molecules.

440
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:10,227
它们中的一些应该是在地球形成的
Some of them might be made here on Earth,

441
00:23:10,727 --> 00:23:13,533
但其它的应该在太空里更容易形成
but others might be easier to make out in space

442
00:23:13,797 --> 00:23:16,755
它们被小行星或彗星带到了地球
and then bring them here to Earth on asteroids or comets.

443
00:23:20,116 --> 00:23:22,894
这是可能的，如果没有我们太空邻居
narrator: It's possible that without extraterrestrial gifts

444
00:23:23,074 --> 00:23:24,658
给予的天外礼物
from our neighbors in space,

445
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:28,144
地球上的生命可能永远不会出现
life on Earth might never have happened.

446
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:33,060
银河邻居们可能会帮助孕育我们
Milky Way neighbors may have helped nurture us,

447
00:23:33,741 --> 00:23:36,977
但银河也有能杀死我们的东西
but the Milky Way has things that can kill us as well,

448
00:23:37,852 --> 00:23:39,602
比如这一颗
with something like this:

449
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,949
名为葛利斯710的橙矮星
an orange dwarf named Gliese 710.

450
00:23:43,574 --> 00:23:46,616
它的质量大约是太阳的60%
It's about 60% as massive as the Sun

451
00:23:46,907 --> 00:23:50,046
目前离地球63光年
and is currently just 63 light-years from Earth

452
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:52,046
正在不断逼近
and getting closer.

453
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:55,018
葛利斯710几乎是
- Gliese 710 appears to be heading

454
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:57,213
向着太阳系直冲过来
pretty much straight toward the solar system.

455
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:02,601
当一颗橙矮星越接近太阳系，它越值得关注
- As an orange dwarf approaches the solar system, it becomes more and more significant.

456
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:04,796
在距离1光年左右时
When it's about a light-year away or less,

457
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,199
它就变得非常紧要了
then it becomes very important.

458
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,657
离地球将近1光年的是
narrator: Almost exactly 1 light-year away from Earth

459
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:14,837
一个有冰冻物体的巨大区域，它被称为奥尔特云
is a huge region of icy objects called the Oort cloud.

460
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:19,663
奥尔特云里的物体会变成彗星
- The Oort cloud objects could turn into comets

461
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:22,087
如果它们离太阳足够近的话
if they were to come close enough to the Sun,

462
00:24:22,323 --> 00:24:24,157
但我们通常根本看不到
but usually we don't see them at all

463
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,448
因为它们离太阳是如此的远
because they're so far away from the Sun.

464
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:29,420
数十亿潜在的彗星
narrator: Billions of potential comets

465
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:33,143
在等待着某些东西，比如葛利斯710
are waiting for something to give them a gravitational push,

466
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:37,406
给它们一个万有引力的推动
something like Gliese 710.

467
00:24:39,365 --> 00:24:41,379
它会开始横穿奥尔特云
- It'll start intersecting the Oort cloud

468
00:24:41,392 --> 00:24:43,545
或至少是万有引力
or at least gravitationally disturbing it

469
00:24:43,712 --> 00:24:46,227
对它干扰了130万年
in something like 1.3 million years.

470
00:24:48,503 --> 00:24:51,045
如果葛利斯710靠得足够近，其万有引力
narrator: If Gliese 710 gets close enough,

471
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:54,569
会让无威胁的由冰和尘埃组成的厚块
its gravity could turn harmless chunks of ice and dust

472
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,569
变成向我们进攻的狂怒彗星
into rampaging comets launched at us.

473
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,725
对地球来说，其结果是毁灭性的
The results for Earth could be devastating.

474
00:25:06,225 --> 00:25:09,392
到那时，会有一场大规模的彗星攻击
- At that point, there could be a huge onslaught of comets

475
00:25:09,406 --> 00:25:11,045
发生在内太阳系里
into the inner solar system

476
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,948
从而导致再一次灭绝
that could lead to another mass extinction.

477
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,420
我们不知道它将来是否发生
We don't know that that'll happen,

478
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:16,822
但它能够发生
but it could happen.

479

480
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:25,989
天文学家说，有86%的概率
narrator: Astronomers say there's an 86% chance

481
00:25:26,003 --> 00:25:30,419
葛利斯710将会横穿奥尔特云
that Gliese 710 will barrel right through the Oort cloud.

482
00:25:31,586 --> 00:25:34,642
因此，假如橙色球是葛利斯710这样的橙矮星
- So if the orange ball was like an orange dwarf like Gliese 710

483
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:36,378
球瓶是奥尔特云
and the pins were the Oort cloud,

484
00:25:38,308 --> 00:25:39,808
这就是要发生的事情
this is one thing that could happen.

485
00:25:40,003 --> 00:25:41,919
对，但也有别的可能
- All right, but here's something else that could happen.

486
00:25:42,989 --> 00:25:45,489
存在14%的概率，葛利斯710会在外侧
There's a 14% chance that Gliese 710

487
00:25:45,516 --> 00:25:47,141
与奥尔特云擦肩而过
is just gonna pass right by,

488
00:25:47,155 --> 00:25:49,419
根本没有进入它的里面
outside the Oort cloud, not coming inside it at all.

489
00:25:50,725 --> 00:25:52,725
但是，即使没有直接命中
narrator: But even without a direct hit,

490
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,072
这个恒星的万有引力
the effect of the star's gravity

491
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:58,516
至少能够影响到一些彗星
could disrupt at least some comets

492
00:25:59,863 --> 00:26:02,238
使得它们直接冲向地球
and send them straight for us.

493
00:26:02,988 --> 00:26:06,155
所以，这个恒星能驱使少许彗星冲向内太阳系
- So the star could knock just a few comets toward the inner solar system.

494
00:26:06,252 --> 00:26:08,169
而结果是一颗彗星撞击地球
- And all it takes is one comet to hit Earth

495
00:26:08,183 --> 00:26:09,488
引起一场大灾难
to cause a catastrophe.

496
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,808
我们需要担心的，不止是葛利斯710
narrator: We've got more than just Gliese 710 to worry about.

497
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:21,113
有超过150颗恒星
There are more than 150 stars

498
00:26:21,294 --> 00:26:25,243
在接下来的200万年里，与我们近得足以干扰到我们
close enough to disturb us within the next 2 million years.

499
00:26:27,016 --> 00:26:28,891
银河系里的恒星
- The stars in our Milky Way galaxy

500
00:26:29,113 --> 00:26:31,377
受到万有引力的制约在一起运行
are all gravitationally bound together,

501
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,405
所以它们沿着不同轨道运行
so they're moving in various directions,

502
00:26:33,543 --> 00:26:36,321
总体上是在围绕着银河中心旋转
overall a rotation around the center of our galaxy,

503
00:26:36,418 --> 00:26:38,946
但不是所有的物体都恰好如此
but not all the orbits are exactly the same.

504
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:41,224
这意味着，从我们这里看过去
That means, from our perspective,

505
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:44,585
恒星不是离我们远去，就是向我们冲来
a given star might be going away from us or toward us.

506
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,904
而美国宇航局估计
narrator: And NASA estimates

507
00:26:47,377 --> 00:26:50,488
有超过20,000颗直径300英尺以上的
there are more than 20,000 near-Earth asteroids

508
00:26:50,502 --> 00:26:52,793
近地小行星
more than 300 feet across...

509
00:26:55,404 --> 00:26:58,349
比如“2005 YU55”
Like 2005 YU55,

510
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:01,251
它在2011年11月的时候
which, in November 2011,

511
00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:03,779
比月亮还要靠近地球
came closer to the Earth than the Moon.

512
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:07,904
在未来的200年内，它可能会离地球更近
It might come even closer in 200 years.

513
00:27:08,696 --> 00:27:12,029
被这样的石头撞击，情况会多糟糕呢？
How bad would it be to get hit by a rock like that?

514
00:27:12,557 --> 00:27:16,182
想像一下二战末期的长崎市
Think about Nagasaki at the end of World War II

515
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:20,279
然后乘以四
and multiply by four.

516
00:27:22,334 --> 00:27:24,765
在搜索我们这个银河角落的
As we've searched our corner of the Milky Way

517
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:27,260
坏邻居和好邻居时
for other neighbors, bad and good,

518
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:30,529
我们发现了一些非常意想不到的事情
we've found some very unexpected things.

519
00:27:30,737 --> 00:27:34,112
现有证据表明，有些恒星的温度低到可以触摸
We now have evidence of stars cold enough to touch

520
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:37,607
而有些行星简直就是出自科幻小说
and planets straight out of science fiction.

521
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:44,542
对银河里我们这个地方的探测
Exploring our place in the Milky Way

522
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,250
引起了一个又一个的惊讶
has turned up one surprise after another.

523
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,709
这就像是你的邻居有一座房子
- It's like there was a house in your neighborhood

524
00:27:51,723 --> 00:27:53,112
但你从不知道它
that you never knew was there

525
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,499
你在猛然间
and that you've suddenly discovered,

526
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,945
才发现它在大街上
but it's just down the block.

527
00:27:57,681 --> 00:27:59,070
阿尔法星
narrator: Take Alpha Centauri,

528
00:27:59,139 --> 00:28:02,195
这颗半人马座里最亮的恒星
the brightest star in the constellation Centaurus

529
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,472
与我们最近的恒星邻居太阳
and, after the Sun, our nearest neighbor star,

530
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:10,028
距离4.3光年，即25万亿英里
4.3 light-years, or 25 trillion miles, away.

531
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,319
在17世纪，天文学家宣称
In the 17th century, astronomers announced

532
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:19,528
阿尔法星是双星
that Alpha Centauri was really two stars.

533
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:22,819
然后，在20世纪
Then, in the 20th century,

534
00:28:22,972 --> 00:28:25,514
它被认为是三合星
it turned out to be a triple system.

535
00:28:26,694 --> 00:28:29,972
阿尔法A星是典型的类太阳恒星
- Alpha Centauri A is very much a sun-like star,

536
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,583
其质量几乎与太阳相当
nearly exactly the same mass as our Sun.

537
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,957
阿尔法B星则稍小一些
Alpha Centauri B is a little bit less massive.

538
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,514
第三颗星，比邻星
The third star, Proxima Centauri,

539
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:41,277
是一颗M型恒星
is an M-type star.

540
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:43,000
质量非常小
It's a very low-mass star,

541
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,097
或许只有太阳的12%
having perhaps only 12% the mass of our Sun.

542
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:49,722
它非常微弱，肉眼看不到
It's so faint that we can't see it with our unaided eye.

543
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,333
其它非常出名的恒星邻居
narrator: It turns out that other very well-known neighbor stars

544
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,583
结果也都是双星
are also multiple systems.

545
00:28:59,944 --> 00:29:02,888
天狼星，距离我们8.6光年
Sirius, just 8.6 light-years away

546
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:04,860
在数千年里
and famed for thousands of years

547
00:29:04,888 --> 00:29:07,416
一直以天空里最亮的星而著名
as the brightest single star in the sky,

548
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,374
是一颗双星
is really a binary star.

549
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:14,374
大多数恒星的质量和体积比太阳小
- Most stars are less massive and smaller than our Sun,

550
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:16,918
同时，大多数恒星是双星系统
and most stars are in binary systems.

551
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:20,388
从这两方面来看，太阳稍为有点例外
In both respects, our Sun is a little bit of an exception.

552
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:26,818
大多数恒星是红矮星或褐矮星
- The majority of stars are red dwarfs or brown dwarfs.

553
00:29:27,943 --> 00:29:30,582
红矮星占恒星数量的70%
Red dwarfs make up 70% of the stars

554
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:33,055
不单在我们银河是这样，在宇宙里也是如此
not only in our galaxy but in the universe,

555
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,763
因此，即使是我们围绕太阳运行
and so even though we orbit our Sun

556
00:29:35,777 --> 00:29:38,915
我们倾向于说它是神圣的恒星
and we tend to think of it as the iconic star,

557
00:29:39,304 --> 00:29:41,707
但事实上，这种红矮星非常普遍
really, the red dwarfs are far more common.

558
00:29:42,888 --> 00:29:44,721
对于褐矮星这些邻居
narrator: As for the brown dwarfs,

559
00:29:45,235 --> 00:29:47,332
我们在20世纪90年代之前
these are neighbors we weren't sure existed

560
00:29:47,346 --> 00:29:49,138
还不能肯定它们的存在
until the 1990s.

561
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:53,221
它们不太象恒星，但它们不是行星
They're not quite stars, but they're not planets.

562
00:29:54,207 --> 00:29:57,012
噢，而且它们不是真的褐色
Oh, and they're not really brown either.

563
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:02,082
褐矮星是我们太阳系最神秘的居民之一
- The brown dwarfs are some of the most mysterious denizens of the solar neighborhood

564
00:30:02,415 --> 00:30:05,790
因为它们非常非常寒冷，所以非常黑
because they're really very, very cold, and they're very dark,

565
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,193
这就意味着不能发出大量的光
and that means that they don't give off a lot of light,

566
00:30:08,415 --> 00:30:10,179
因此它们非常难以看到
and they're very difficult to see.

567
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,220
2011年，美国宇航局一架广角红外探测器
narrator: In 2011, one of NASA's space telescopes,

568
00:30:16,818 --> 00:30:20,975
即简称WISE的太空望远镜
the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE,

569
00:30:21,498 --> 00:30:24,979
发现了恰好位于我们地区的一系列褐矮星
found a series of brown dwarfs right in our neighborhood,

570
00:30:25,262 --> 00:30:27,823
它们距离我们在9至40光年之间
between 9 and 40 light-years away,

571
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:31,401
拥有我们曾认为不可能的表面温度
with surface temperatures once considered impossible.

572
00:30:32,692 --> 00:30:36,581
我们发现的这些褐矮星，其中有一颗很清凉
- One of these brown dwarfs that we found is actually so cool

573
00:30:36,776 --> 00:30:38,246
你可以用手去触摸它
that you could touch it with your hand.

574
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,192
它只有华氏80度
（约27摄氏度）
It's only 80 degrees Fahrenheit,

575
00:30:40,345 --> 00:30:43,303
同样的温度在地球这里，会是好天气
the same temperature as a really lovely day out here on Earth.

576
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:46,039
因此，以后的发现谁也说不清楚
And so who knows what else we'll find.

577
00:30:46,706 --> 00:30:49,136
我们观察得越多，发现就越多
The more we look, the more we see.

578
00:30:51,206 --> 00:30:53,849
为什么恒星的颜色不尽相同？
narrator: Why are stars so many different colors?

579
00:30:54,373 --> 00:30:57,358
这是路易斯安那州巴吞鲁日的安娜.K
That's what Anna K. of Baton Rouge, Louisiana,

580
00:30:57,386 --> 00:30:59,886
写信给《宇宙》咨询的问题
texted to ask The Universe.

581
00:31:00,983 --> 00:31:03,233
安娜，这问题很有趣
- Anna, that's a really interesting question.

582
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:06,233
总的来说，恒星颜色不尽相同
Basically, stars have slightly different colors

583
00:31:06,247 --> 00:31:08,595
是因为其表面温度不同
because they have different surface temperatures.

584
00:31:09,192 --> 00:31:12,233
温度不高的恒星，例如参宿四，看起来是淡红色
Cool stars like Betelgeuse look reddish,

585
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:15,580
它们只有华氏6,000、7,000度
（约摄氏3,300至3,900度）
and they have temperatures of only 6,000 or 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

586
00:31:16,358 --> 00:31:19,525
最热的恒星，比如参宿七，呈浅蓝色
The hottest stars, like Rigel, appear bluish,

587
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:22,067
它们的温度超过了20,000度
（约摄氏11,000度）
and they're upwards of 20,000 degrees.

588
00:31:22,525 --> 00:31:24,080
至于太阳这样的恒星
Then there are stars like the Sun,

589
00:31:24,178 --> 00:31:26,719
温度为10,000、11,000度
（约摄氏5,500至6,100度）
with temperatures of 10,000 or 11,000 degrees,

590
00:31:26,733 --> 00:31:28,041
看起来是白色的
and they look white.

591
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,886
现在，初升的太阳看起来是黄色
Now, the Sun looks yellow when it's setting,

592
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,983
这是因为大气层的影响
but that's because of atmospheric effects.

593
00:31:32,997 --> 00:31:34,816
它真正的颜色是白色
Its true color is white.

594
00:31:38,969 --> 00:31:41,233
那里不是只有恒星
narrator: There are more than stars out there.

595
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:44,455
我们在本地泡的里面和外面发现了
We've discovered hundreds of neighboring planets

596
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:47,024
数以百计的行星邻居
inside and outside the local bubble.

597
00:31:47,816 --> 00:31:51,011
我们通过开普勒任务，已经发现了
- We have discovered a lot of exoplanet candidates

598
00:31:51,205 --> 00:31:52,761
大量申报中的外星球
through a mission called Kepler

599
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:56,219
该任务利用行星经过其母恒星面前时
that is looking at essentially little eclipses,

600
00:31:56,496 --> 00:31:58,927
光线变弱少许接着复原
when a planet moves in front of its parent star

601
00:31:58,941 --> 00:32:00,052
这一原理
and then out,

602
00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:02,733
去观察星光的微弱变化
and the light dips a little and then goes back up.

603
00:32:03,774 --> 00:32:05,399
它非常难以看到
- It's very difficult to see,

604
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:09,927
类似于在拉斯维加斯大道上，去寻找唯一一盏熄灭了的灯
analogous to watching for a single lightbulb going out on the Vegas Strip.

605
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,566
但开普勒
But Kepler is capable

606
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,663
是十分精确的测量高手
of doing these measurements so precisely

607
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:16,093
它能在象我们太阳一样的恒星周围
that it's able to find even planets

608
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:19,135
发现环绕运行的行星，即使它象地球那样小
as small as our own Earth around stars like our Sun.

609
00:32:21,927 --> 00:32:24,857
我们发现第一颗外星球只有15年
- The first exoplanet we discovered，was only about 15 years ago,

610
00:32:24,871 --> 00:32:27,538
这很类似于我们是大街上唯一的房子
and it was very much like we were the only house on the block,

611
00:32:27,552 --> 00:32:30,135
然后我们看到第一个邻居建房子
and we saw the first neighbor putting up their house,

612
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,940
从此之后，街区全面发展壮大
and ever since then, the entire neighborhood has grown.

613
00:32:32,954 --> 00:32:36,274
外星球群落就这样在我们本地建起来了
You built up communities of other exoplanets out in our local neighborhood.

614
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:41,205
据我们所知
narrator: As far as we know,

615
00:32:41,635 --> 00:32:44,774
外太阳系最靠近我们的行星邻居
our nearest planetary neighbor outside the solar system

616
00:32:44,787 --> 00:32:48,982
来到了大街上，距离我们10.5光年
is just down the street, 10.5 light-years away,

617
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,912
它围绕着桔红色的天苑四运行
orbiting the orange star Epsilon Eridani.

618
00:32:53,884 --> 00:32:57,996
这颗行星，我们肯定到不了，也不能奢望它有生命存在
- This planet isn't exactly something that we could go visit and expect to find life.

619
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:00,746
我们认为这颗行星更象是
We think that this planet is more equivalent

620
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:03,398
我们太阳系里的木星--
to a planet like Jupiter in our solar system-

621
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:05,468
一个巨大的气态球体
a big ball of gas,

622
00:33:05,634 --> 00:33:07,412
无论我们怎样去理解它
which, as we understand it anyway,

623
00:33:07,426 --> 00:33:09,134
它都不是寻找生命的好去处
isn't a great place to look for life.

624
00:33:10,343 --> 00:33:13,481
在稍远一点，大约200光年的地方
narrator: A little farther out, about 200 light-years,

625
00:33:13,551 --> 00:33:15,343
是另外一个惊奇--
is another surprise-

626
00:33:16,106 --> 00:33:17,815
一颗行星看起来象是
a planet that looks like something

627
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:19,731
从《星球大战》电影出来的东西
out of a Star Wars movie.

628
00:33:20,134 --> 00:33:22,481
就在最近，开普勒望远镜发现了
- Just recently, the Kepler telescope discovered

629
00:33:22,495 --> 00:33:24,592
一颗行星围绕两个太阳运转
a planet that orbits two suns,

630
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:27,426
它被命名为开普勒-16b
and this is a planet called Kepler-16b.

631
00:33:29,328 --> 00:33:32,773
这颗行星即使与“塔图因”很相似
（《星球大战》中的沙漠行星）
So this planet, even though it has similarities to Tatooine,

632
00:33:32,912 --> 00:33:35,759
但它完全不像天行者卢克的故土
isn't exactly like Luke Skywalker's home world.

633
00:33:36,717 --> 00:33:39,245
它实际上是一个冰与气体组成的行星
It's actually a planet that's icy and gassy,

634
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,370
更像土星，不象我们地球
more like Saturn than our own Earth.

635
00:33:42,106 --> 00:33:45,064
在这个发现之前，我们从来都不相信
Now, we were never sure, prior to this discovery,

636
00:33:45,175 --> 00:33:48,231
一个行星能有两个太阳
whether you could have a planet that actually has two suns,

637
00:33:48,703 --> 00:33:50,925
因此，既然现在发现了一个
and so now that we've found one,

638
00:33:51,036 --> 00:33:52,661
就有可能发现更多
we know that these are possible,

639
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:56,272
这就让人很感兴趣，因为它意味着这些双星系统
and that's really interesting, because it means that these binary systems

640
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,161
是寻找行星的好地方
are good places to look for planets.

641
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:03,411
在2011年，天文学家揭开了我们地区
narrator: In 2011, astronomers unveiled

642
00:34:03,425 --> 00:34:05,675
一种新型行星的面纱，它就是
a new kind of planet in our neighborhood-

643
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,675
流浪行星
the homeless.

644
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:11,564
有一些行星被发现具有这样的特征
- There have been some indications that there are planets to be found

645
00:34:11,703 --> 00:34:15,286
它们不在围绕其母恒星的轨道上运行
that are not in orbit around their parent star.

646
00:34:15,536 --> 00:34:17,703
它们开始时是围绕母恒星运行的
They started out in orbit around their parent star

647
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,119
但不知为什么，它们从自己的太阳系跑了出去
but somehow got ejected from their solar system,

648
00:34:21,147 --> 00:34:24,036
目前在银河系里漫无目的地闲逛
and now they're wandering the galaxy aimlessly,

649
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:25,661
无家可归
without a place to call home,

650
00:34:25,841 --> 00:34:28,508
对这些曾是行星，没有了母恒星的天体
so one wonders if pretty soon we'll have another

651
00:34:28,661 --> 00:34:31,383
人们充满了好奇
new definition that encompasses those bodies

652
00:34:31,397 --> 00:34:32,800
希望能在不久的将来
that used to be planets

653
00:34:32,813 --> 00:34:35,480
有更多的认识
and no longer have a parent star.

654
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:39,772
我认为这些被驱逐的天体依然是行星
- I think it's still valid to refer to these ejected bodies as planets,

655
00:34:39,785 --> 00:34:42,424
因为“行星”在希腊文中就是指“流浪者”
because "planet" is the Greek word for "wanderer,"

656
00:34:43,355 --> 00:34:45,410
而它们的确是在外层空间流浪
and they are certainly wandering through deep space.

657
00:34:47,924 --> 00:34:49,272
从太阳系邻居身上
narrator: We've even learned new things

658
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:51,369
我们甚至能学到了许多新东西
about our solar system neighbors.

659
00:34:52,521 --> 00:34:54,396
2011年夏天
In the summer of 2011,

660
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:57,132
哈勃太空望远镜拍到了以前被忽视的
the Hubble Space Telescope took the first pictures

661
00:34:57,146 --> 00:35:01,480
矮行星冥王星的第四个卫星的第一张照片
of the dwarf planet Pluto's previously unsuspected fourth moon.

662
00:35:02,855 --> 00:35:05,299
可能你会纳闷，冥王星不是太遥远
- Now, you might wonder, Pluto is not all that distant.

663
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:08,377
发现它的第四个卫星，为什么要花费这么长的时间？
Why did it take us so long to find a fourth moon?

664
00:35:08,716 --> 00:35:11,063
嗯，这是因为它非常非常小
Well, it's because it's very, very small,

665
00:35:11,077 --> 00:35:14,382
直径只有10至20英里，所以它非常暗弱
only 10 to 20 miles in diameter, so it's very faint.

666
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,854
它只反射少量的阳光
It reflects only a little bit of the Sun's light.

667
00:35:18,229 --> 00:35:19,632
这颗新卫星
narrator: The new Moon is probably

668
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,938
很可能就象冥王星一样，是一个严寒和死寂的世界
a frozen, lifeless world like Pluto itself.

669
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:28,479
迄今为止，所有我们最近发现的邻居
So far, all of our newly discovered neighbors

670
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:32,118
不是太热，就是太冷，根本没有我们这种生命
have been too hot or too cold to have any possibility

671
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:33,771
存在的可能
of our kind of life,

672
00:35:35,298 --> 00:35:37,062
但搜索在继续着
but the search goes on.

673
00:35:38,618 --> 00:35:40,840
所以，即使我们还没有做到
- So even though we haven't done it yet,

674
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:43,062
但科技已经能够紧跟上
we're at this point where our technology

675
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:44,548
我们的需要
has caught up to our needs,

676
00:35:44,562 --> 00:35:46,548
相信我们在不久的将来
and we're actually going to be able to start

677
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:50,576
将能踏上旅程，去发现那些与地球相似的行星
finding those planets like Earth in the really near future.

678
00:35:50,909 --> 00:35:53,854
然而，要确定它们是否支持生命
However, being able to determine whether they would be

679
00:35:53,868 --> 00:35:56,951
是一个难上加难的任务
supportive of life is a much more difficult task.

680
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:02,409
在我们银河角落，已发现的外行星
narrator: None of the exoplanets we've discovered

681
00:36:02,423 --> 00:36:06,048
没有谁是在高举拳头恐吓我们的
in our corner of the Milky Way pose any threat to us,

682
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:10,798
但别处的一些恒星会怎么样呢？
but what about some of the stars out there?

683
00:36:11,854 --> 00:36:16,117
它们中的一些会扯上我们同归于尽吗？
Could some of them die and take us with them?

684
00:36:22,506 --> 00:36:25,659
银河里的我们这个地方有许多的好处
Our place in the Milky Way has a lot of plusses.

685
00:36:27,256 --> 00:36:29,492
我们正处在生命可以形成的地带
We're right in the zone for life to form,

686
00:36:30,145 --> 00:36:34,228
最近的恒星让我们免受宇宙射线的侵害
our closest star protects us from dangerous cosmic rays,

687
00:36:34,964 --> 00:36:37,839
大多数的邻居不会打扰我们
and most of our neighbors don't disturb us.

688
00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:42,672
但邻居是会翻脸的
But neighborhoods can change.

689
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:48,464
城门失火
If a fire destroys a nearby home or business,

690
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:51,873
会殃及池鱼
your home could also be damaged,

691
00:36:52,672 --> 00:36:55,256
所以，想像一下，当一颗恒星
so imagine what might happen when a star

692
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:58,713
像超新星一样呜乎哀哉时发生的事情吧
goes out of business as a supernova.

693
00:37:02,478 --> 00:37:04,214
这意味着它们会爆炸
- That means they'll explode

694
00:37:04,228 --> 00:37:08,594
把内部所有物质都抛到银河里
and throw all their innards back out to the galaxy.

695
00:37:11,714 --> 00:37:14,283
爆炸的恒星创造了我们
narrator: Exploding stars created us,

696
00:37:14,422 --> 00:37:17,325
恒星里的大多数重元素围绕着我们
most of the heavy elements in the stars around us,

697
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:21,047
气体在太阳系里弥漫
and the gas clouds the solar system dwells in,

698
00:37:22,436 --> 00:37:25,005
但在一颗死亡中的恒星爆炸时
but it's a bad idea to be too close

699
00:37:25,241 --> 00:37:27,617
离它太近，则是一个臭主意
when a dying star explodes.

700
00:37:30,658 --> 00:37:32,047
超新星的爆炸
- A supernova explosion

701
00:37:32,061 --> 00:37:34,477
是极为强烈的爆炸
is an incredibly powerful explosion.

702
00:37:36,769 --> 00:37:39,505
恒星中心急速蹦出
The core of the star bounces out

703
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:42,241
撞碎外层
and smashes into the outer layers

704
00:37:42,255 --> 00:37:46,215
把它们爆裂到银河里
and blows them out into the galaxy.

705
00:37:46,574 --> 00:37:48,935
所以，这些物质
So what actually happens is that material

706
00:37:48,991 --> 00:37:51,463
会产生一股冲击波
gets thrown out in a shock wave that,

707
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:55,143
如果你离冲击波足够近，就会被毁灭
if you're near enough to the shock wave,
would be destructive.

708
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,100
如果距离10光年左右
- If it's 10 light-years away or so,

709
00:38:00,282 --> 00:38:03,921
则正如X射线和伽马射线的一样，高能辐射会危害我们
then high-energy radiation like from X-rays and gamma rays can harm us.

710
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,990
它们会，比如，瓦解臭氧层
They can, for example, destroy part of the ozone layer.

711
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:11,004
具体是，辐射进来了
What happens is, the radiation comes in,

712
00:38:11,615 --> 00:38:13,780
使氮分子发生分裂
disrupts nitrogen molecules.

713
00:38:14,046 --> 00:38:17,626
然后氮原子与氧结合
The nitrogen atoms then combine with oxygen

714
00:38:17,907 --> 00:38:19,893
生成一氧化氮
to form nitric oxide.

715
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,460
一氧化氮，“NO”
That nitric oxide, NO,

716
00:38:22,949 --> 00:38:26,130
分裂臭氧分子，“O3”
disrupts ozone molecules, O3,

717
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:29,300
生成二氧化氮，“NO2”
and forms nitrogen dioxide, NO2.

718
00:38:30,212 --> 00:38:33,976
然后二氧化氮会与氧原子结合
The nitrogen dioxide can then combine with atomic oxygen,

719
00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:36,115
生成更多的一氧化氮
forming more nitric oxide,

720
00:38:36,184 --> 00:38:39,184
接着分裂更多的臭氧
which then disrupts more ozone,

721
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:41,393
从而导致了滚雪球效应
which leads to a snowball effect.

722
00:38:41,781 --> 00:38:46,504
因此，不到数周，臭氧层就被摧毁得差不多了
So within a few weeks, you can destroy much of the ozone layer,

723
00:38:46,698 --> 00:38:49,934
此时，太阳的紫外线辐射畅通无阻
allowing the Sun's ultraviolet radiation to come in,

724
00:38:50,698 --> 00:38:52,615
它会杀死
and that would then kill life

725
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:55,962
海面上的或池塘里的生命
that's on the surface layers of an ocean or in ponds.

726
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:01,017
死亡者中会包括浮游植物
narrator: That death toll would include the phytoplankton

727
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:04,337
要知道，它们是海洋食物链的基础
that are the foundation of the marine food chain

728
00:39:05,017 --> 00:39:07,976
同时为地球提供了50%的氧气
and provide 50% of the Earth's oxygen,

729
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:13,014
这样就等于宣判了绝大多数生命形体的死刑
and that would spell doom for most larger forms of life,

730
00:39:13,364 --> 00:39:15,178
包括我们
including us.

731
00:39:18,684 --> 00:39:20,948
有一个星球灰飞烟灭的故事
One candidate for stellar extinction lies

732
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:22,684
正在本地泡外面上演
outside the local bubble, although it's been

733
00:39:23,406 --> 00:39:27,086
主角是数千年来我们一直熟悉的
a familiar sight for thousands of years:

734
00:39:27,684 --> 00:39:30,545
红超巨星
the red supergiant Betelgeuse.

735
00:39:32,364 --> 00:39:35,767
这个恒星距离我们500至800光年
The star, between 500 and 800 light-years away

736
00:39:35,781 --> 00:39:37,975
其质量是太阳的20倍
and 20 times the mass of the Sun,

737
00:39:38,225 --> 00:39:41,461
构成猎户星座的右肩
forms the right shoulder of the constellation Orion.

738
00:39:43,336 --> 00:39:45,919
参宿四正在走近生命的尽头
- Betelgeuse is getting near the end of its life.

739
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:50,794
从1996到2011年
narrator: Between 1996 and 2011,

740
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:54,794
参宿四缩小了15%
Betelgeuse shrank by 15%

741
00:39:56,183 --> 00:39:58,669
其原因目前还不清楚
for reasons that are still not understood.

742
00:39:59,753 --> 00:40:03,644
这个红巨星可能会在50万年内变成超新星
The red giant may go supernova in half a million years,

743
00:40:03,975 --> 00:40:06,628
或者这可能已经发生了
or it may have already happened.

744
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,558
可能参宿四
- It's conceivable that Betelgeuse

745
00:40:09,572 --> 00:40:12,657
会在今晚、明晚或下周变成超新星
will go supernova tonight or tomorrow night or next week,

746
00:40:13,072 --> 00:40:15,655
但它更可能在100,000年里
but it's much more likely to become a supernova

747
00:40:15,808 --> 00:40:18,641
或在数个100,000年里变成超新星
in 100,000 years or in a few 100,000 years.

748
00:40:19,141 --> 00:40:22,280
在参宿四距离我们数百光年的情况下
Given that Betelgeuse is at least a few hundred light-years away,

749
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,627
它可能已经爆炸了
it's possible that it's already blown up,

750
00:40:24,752 --> 00:40:28,072
我们之所以不知道，是因为光线还没有到达这里
and we just don't know it because the light hasn't reached us yet.

751
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,447
好消息是
narrator: The good news is that

752
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,266
哪怕猎户星座失去它的右肩
even if Orion does dislocate its shoulder,

753
00:40:35,655 --> 00:40:39,113
参宿四太遥远了，危害不到我们地区
Betelgeuse is too far away to harm our neighborhood.

754
00:40:41,974 --> 00:40:44,481
但另一方面，坏消息是
But then there's HR 8210,

755
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:47,280
距离我们大约150光年
about 150 light-years away,

756
00:40:47,419 --> 00:40:49,599
在飞马座里的HR 8210
in the constellation Pegasus.

757
00:40:50,016 --> 00:40:52,484
它不是一颗恒星，而是两颗--
It's not one star but two-

758
00:40:52,863 --> 00:40:57,154
一颗恒星和一颗白矮星，在双轨道内相互围绕运行
a star and a white dwarf in binary orbit around each other.

759
00:40:57,724 --> 00:41:01,960
这颗白矮星质量比太阳大约大15%
The white dwarf is about 15% more massive than our Sun-

760
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:05,613
还没有到达向超新星演变的转折点
not at the supernova tipping point yet.

761
00:41:06,988 --> 00:41:09,863
HR 8210是双星系统
- HR 8210 is this binary system,

762
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:11,849
两颗恒星相互围绕运行
two stars that are orbiting one another,

763
00:41:11,988 --> 00:41:14,015
已经死亡的那颗
one of which has actually already died

764
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:15,293
是一颗白矮星
and is a white dwarf.

765
00:41:15,696 --> 00:41:17,598
现在，这个体系有这样的可能
Now, this system has the potential

766
00:41:17,612 --> 00:41:20,598
当目前非常高温的那一颗恒星
that when the star that's very hot right now

767
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:22,307
开始垂死挣扎
starts to go through its death throes

768
00:41:22,321 --> 00:41:24,862
并在死亡过程中开始膨胀时
and stars to puff up as it dies,

769
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:28,687
它会开始在这颗白矮星上面倾泻物质
it might start to pour material onto that white dwarf.

770
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:31,987
从本质上来说，这些系统就象是吞食同伴的
Essentially these systems are like zombie stars

771
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:33,584
僵尸恒星
eating their companions.

772
00:41:34,765 --> 00:41:37,126
当那个正常的恒星开始变大
- When that normal star starts to expand,

773
00:41:37,237 --> 00:41:39,668
白矮星会开始
the white dwarf will start stealing material

774
00:41:39,682 --> 00:41:42,237
偷窃同伴的物质，质量变得更加大
from its companion, becoming more massive,

775
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:45,223
假如它达到某一个不稳定的极限时
and if it reaches a certain unstable limit,

776
00:41:45,431 --> 00:41:48,126
它会象“Ia型超新星”一样爆炸
（热核爆炸型超新星）
it'll blow up as a type Ia supernova.

777
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:53,876
我们远到足以避开
narrator: Are we far enough away

778
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:58,501
HR 8210爆炸时带来的飞来横祸吗？
to avoid being collateral damage when HR 8210 explodes?

779
00:41:59,723 --> 00:42:02,431
如果要在超新星爆炸时毫发无损
- If you want to be completely safe from a supernova,

780
00:42:02,598 --> 00:42:05,103
你应当至少距离它100光年远
you should be at least 100 light-years away.

781
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:07,334
10光年可能足够
10 light-years might be enough,

782
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:08,501
也可能不够
but it might not.

783
00:42:08,556 --> 00:42:10,973
这要看首先杀死你的影响而定
It depends on what effect kills you first.

784
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,750
但这在相当长的时间里不会发生
- But that won't happen for a really long time,

785
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:18,236
而到那个时候，我们已不在了
and by then we will have moved off,

786
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,764
同时由于星河里的一切
and it will have moved off

787
00:42:19,861 --> 00:42:21,653
都有各自的发展方向
because everything in the galaxy

788
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:23,361
它也会不在了
is really on its way somewhere.

789
00:42:23,653 --> 00:42:25,681
所以随着时间的流逝
So over time, that might happen,

790
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:27,856
这可能发生，但在发生的刹那
but at the point that it does,

791
00:42:28,695 --> 00:42:31,486
也可能它根本不会太靠近地球
it probably won't be very close to Earth at all anymore.

792
00:42:33,847 --> 00:42:35,833
不过，不要高枕无忧
narrator: But don't feel too comfortable.

793
00:42:36,611 --> 00:42:40,903
HR 8210只是2002年发现的威胁
The threat of HR 8210 was only discovered in 2002.

794
00:42:42,722 --> 00:42:45,917
还有多少潜在的超新星呢？
How many more potential supernovas are out there?

795
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:49,125
它们距离我们有多近？
How close are they to us?

796
00:42:50,486 --> 00:42:53,305
要多久它们会爆炸？
And how soon will they explode?

797
00:42:59,194 --> 00:43:01,442
形势可能不容乐观
To possibly make matters worse,

798
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:05,722
一些天文学家认为，今后在我们地区里
some astronomers say that there are a lot more supernovas

799
00:43:05,736 --> 00:43:07,472
会有大量的超新星
in our neighborhood's future.

800
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:13,083
我们太阳系围绕银河运行的速度
- Our solar system orbits our galaxy at a different rate

801
00:43:13,138 --> 00:43:14,793
与旋臂的不同
than the spiral arms do.

802
00:43:15,138 --> 00:43:17,964
这意味着，最终我们将进入一个旋臂里
That means, eventually, we're gonna enter a spiral arm,

803
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:21,462
而那里有大量的更大质量的恒星
and because there is a lot more massive stars there,

804
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:23,930
它们中的一些会终结自己的生命
some of them will be ending their lives,

805
00:43:23,985 --> 00:43:26,846
产生超新星，对地球上的生命造成
creating supernovae and posing a greater threat

806
00:43:26,888 --> 00:43:28,096
更大威胁
to life on Earth.

807
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:33,818
在今晚，银河里的我们这个地方
narrator: Still, our place in the Milky Way

808
00:43:33,832 --> 00:43:35,605
还是安全的，而且
is secure for tonight

809
00:43:35,999 --> 00:43:38,638
至少在未来的数百万个晚上也会如此--
and for at least a few million nights to come-

810
00:43:39,832 --> 00:43:42,450
我们有大量时间去探索更多
plenty of time for more exploration

811
00:43:42,916 --> 00:43:45,124
也会有更多的惊奇
and more surprises.

812
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,582
我们居住在多变的地区
- We live in a pretty diverse neighborhood, 

813
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:49,443
事实上，事物正在变化
actually, and things are changing.

814
00:43:49,457 --> 00:43:51,110
银河不会一成不变
The galaxy is not a static place,

815
00:43:51,124 --> 00:43:53,096
所以它在亿万年里将会是
so it's gonna be an interesting place to see

816
00:43:53,124 --> 00:43:54,458
一个有趣的地方
in a billion years.

817
00:43:54,513 --> 00:44:00,679
