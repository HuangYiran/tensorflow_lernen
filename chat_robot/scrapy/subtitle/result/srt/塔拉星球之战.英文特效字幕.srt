00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dangerous.

00:18:58,588 --> 00:19:00,385
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about my father?

122
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:01,822
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How will we get him back?

00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,854
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For now, stay inside.

125
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:21,072
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't touch that!

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you still operational?

128
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:28,883
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it. Now, now, now.

129
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:31,147
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no need for violence.

00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:35,989
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You speak our language? How?

134
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:40,719
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Does he speak our language?

00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:42,264
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? No. No, no, no. Now listen...

137
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:47,195
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Priorities first. He's dying.

138

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What language is this? How did you do that?

144

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do I begin?

147
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:23,272
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lieutenant Stanton requires oxygen,

00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:44,354
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The journey lasted several generations and led them here.

222
00:25:44,427 --> 00:25:47,021
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They named this planet Terra.

223
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:16,584
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your home?

224
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:24,455
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You made this? For me?

225
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Synchronous rotations, balance in the focal points.

226
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:34,771
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is really good. Where did you learn to do this?

227
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:38,644
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All I did was put the pieces together. They felt right.

228
00:26:38,714 --> 00:26:41,911
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a natural.

229
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:43,781
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Synchronous rotations.

230
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:47,914
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stabilizing gears fractured!

231
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can...

232
00:26:49,225 --> 00:26:50,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help me repair the ship,

233
00:26:50,993 --> 00:26:53,962
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'll take you to your father.

234
00:26:55,431 --> 00:26:56,921
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Deal?

235
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,174
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}According to my holographic blueprint, this device meets all required specifications

236
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:45,338
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for space travel, approximately.

237
00:27:48,384 --> 00:27:51,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it's not exactly titanium,

238
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:54,547
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but if this thing holds,

239
00:27:54,623 --> 00:27:55,851
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can go home.

240
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,859
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, we have a deal.

241
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:06,793
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this?

242
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:09,838
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Ceremony of Life.

243
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:13,068
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We thank life for what it brings.

244
00:28:13,142 --> 00:28:15,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even if it brings you war?

245
00:28:18,681 --> 00:28:21,673
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Earth Force recruited me when I was eight.

246
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:23,844
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They recruit every kid on the Ark.

247
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,047
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Intensive training, hand-to-hand combat,

248
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,387
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}flight simulation.

249
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,586
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be prepared, always on the ready.

250
00:28:32,661 --> 00:28:36,188
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The best, the finest, the last line of defense.

251
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:41,266
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wouldn't understand.

252
00:28:41,337 --> 00:28:43,362
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You only know peace.

253
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:50,267
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Senn.

254
00:28:50,346 --> 00:28:51,973
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you... - I had to see you.

255
00:28:52,048 --> 00:28:54,414
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've locked yourself up for a week. What's going on?

256
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,043
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Huh? - Look, I know how you must feel.

257
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:59,644
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- But I miss you. - I miss you, too.

258
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:02,282
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just... I need a little time. Please go.

259
00:29:02,358 --> 00:29:04,622
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mala, the Ceremony of Life started. Are we still going together?

260
00:29:05,861 --> 00:29:07,453
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's that noise?

261
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,521
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did you make a new toy for Tuki? - Senn, wait.

262
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:11,498
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew you were working on something.

263
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,972
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mala, run! - Stop! Stop! You're killing him!

264
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:23,177
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll take him... - No!

265
00:29:27,316 --> 00:29:28,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm okay now.

266
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:30,476
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Please, listen. - It's one of them!

267
00:29:30,553 --> 00:29:33,954
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I know. - What? You know?

268
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,321
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We can't let him go. - He's my friend!

269
00:29:36,392 --> 00:29:38,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He'll betray us. - That's enough!

270
00:29:38,427 --> 00:29:40,156
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mala, what... what have you done?

271
00:29:40,229 --> 00:29:42,925
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said he would save my father.

272
00:29:42,998 --> 00:29:44,158
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Senn.

273
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:45,962
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Senn!

274
00:29:48,437 --> 00:29:49,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She protected us, Giddy.

275
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:52,806
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She defended us against her own kind.

276
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,866
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"She"?

277
00:29:54,944 --> 00:29:57,344
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said "she," not "it."

278
00:29:57,413 --> 00:30:01,008
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to go. He'll be back... with company.

279
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,358
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's wrong, Senn? - It's Mala.

280
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:15,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Mala. She's protecting one of them.

281
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:18,565
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's one of those invaders in her house.

282
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,573
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were just here.

283
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did she build that?

284
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,987
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe she did. Search the home.

285
00:30:46,128 --> 00:30:47,755
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Find them.

286
00:31:04,246 --> 00:31:06,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, all clear.

287
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,665
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The elders say a long time ago,

288
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:28,032
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we were apart from nature.

289
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:29,536
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We almost died.

290
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:33,375
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But now we're together,

291
00:31:33,442 --> 00:31:36,536
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}forever, in life.

292
00:31:36,612 --> 00:31:38,637
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fascinating.

293
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:55,327
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are those big things up in the sky, Mom?

294
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,958
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look!

295
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:01,502
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mala!

296
00:32:10,813 --> 00:32:13,407
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it! I'm over here!

297
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:14,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cease fire!

298
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:17,911
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn it! Stop!

299
00:32:22,224 --> 00:32:25,625
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold your fire! I'm over here!

300
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why? Why are they doing this?

301
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:41,643
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know. It wasn't supposed to be this way.

302
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,214
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you sure this is the place?

303
00:33:20,282 --> 00:33:21,806
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was right here.

304
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,285
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Traces under the recent snow layer suggest our craft

305
00:33:26,355 --> 00:33:29,119
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}has been relocated from its position.

306
00:33:29,191 --> 00:33:31,751
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone took it.

307
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:52,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mala, come on! Keep up!

308
00:34:00,222 --> 00:34:02,019
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Strange.

309
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:04,252
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This whole place kind of gives me the creeps.

310
00:34:04,326 --> 00:34:07,625
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The strangeness is increasing.

311
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:23,608
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is all this?

312
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:33,084
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lieutenant Stanton, all signs indicate the trail leads through there.

313
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:56,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those cloud sailers... what are they doing?

314
00:34:56,478 --> 00:34:59,641
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not celebrating life, that's for sure.

315
00:35:28,744 --> 00:35:30,541
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}War.

316
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:33,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess our species have more in common than we thought.

317
00:35:55,938 --> 00:35:57,963
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, come on.

318
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,168
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where are we going? - Hitching a ride.

319
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:22,224
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right! There's my baby.

320
00:36:22,297 --> 00:36:25,664
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like they're trying to figure out how it works.

321
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:27,861
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cockpit's still locked, though, so we got a chance to...

322
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,267
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jim...

323
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:32,136
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Put down your weapon. You're surrounded.

324
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:34,175
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

325
00:36:36,311 --> 00:36:38,711
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stop! Back off, or I'll kill her! - Jim!

326
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Jim! - Play along.

327
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:41,839
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! What are you doing?

328
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:44,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Jim! - Giddy, now!

329
00:36:44,086 --> 00:36:45,917
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- On my way. - No! Let me go!

330
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,592
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said get back!

331
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Mala. They can't see you.

332
00:37:03,205 --> 00:37:05,639
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You can stop fighting now. - You said you'd kill me.

333
00:37:05,707 --> 00:37:07,299
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was just an act, Mala.

334
00:37:07,376 --> 00:37:09,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just pretending. I wouldn't hurt you.

335
00:37:09,378 --> 00:37:10,743
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honestly.

336
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,109
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop him!

337
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,978
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hurry, Giddy! Hurry! - Coming.

338
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,544
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open the hatch.

339
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:23,819
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

340
00:37:26,695 --> 00:37:28,788
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can do it. Come on. Hold it together.

341
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,292
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, baby. Come on.

342
00:37:34,136 --> 00:37:37,765
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not good? - No. Very not good.

343
00:37:39,641 --> 00:37:42,337
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What the... - Uh-oh.

344
00:37:50,419 --> 00:37:53,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Time to go? - Come on. Just one spark.

345
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,832
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right! There we go!

346
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,697
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Giddy. We're going home.

347
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:12,367
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold tight, okay? This could be a bumpy ride.

348
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:57,284
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your people... they made this?

349
00:38:57,352 --> 00:39:00,753
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. Don't let her looks fool you.

350
00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:03,518
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She hasn't aged too well.

351
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:07,255
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Central Control, this is Lieutenant James Stanton.

352
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:09,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Requesting permission to land.

353
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:10,588
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lieutenant Stanton.

354
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:12,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nice of you to finally find your way back to us.

355
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:15,936
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just had myself some shore leave, that's all.

356
00:39:16,004 --> 00:39:18,802
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're cleared for landing in Deck A.

357
00:39:18,874 --> 00:39:20,205
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alert! Alert!

358
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,505
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have depressurization on Deck C!

359
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:24,545
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seal the hatches! Hull breach!

360
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:27,275
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Not again.

361
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Welcome to my world.

362
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,764
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Activate cockpit shield.

363
00:39:52,774 --> 00:39:53,763
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on, Mala.

364
00:39:53,842 --> 00:39:56,276
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to stay here, okay? It's not safe.

365
00:39:56,344 --> 00:39:59,404
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jim, I didn't come all this way to hide. I have to find my father.

366
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,813
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand. I'll take you to him, I promise.

367
00:40:01,883 --> 00:40:05,979
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you have to trust me. I'll be right back.

368
00:40:06,054 --> 00:40:08,887
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please try not to touch anything, Mala.

369
00:40:19,868 --> 00:40:22,894
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you survive your crash?

370
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:27,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After my ship went down, I woke up to find I'd been rescued and...

371
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:29,036
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By whom?

372
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:30,544
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A native.

373
00:40:30,612 --> 00:40:32,807
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are the natives hostile?

374
00:40:32,881 --> 00:40:34,212
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

375
00:40:34,282 --> 00:40:36,273
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do they have weapons?

376
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,148
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

377
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,519
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Advanced weapons?

378
00:40:50,398 --> 00:40:53,925
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I'll be right back," he says.

379
00:41:39,447 --> 00:41:41,506
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no! Mala!

380
00:41:46,288 --> 00:41:49,257
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Jim. I missed you, bro.

381
00:41:49,324 --> 00:41:51,155
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stewart.

382
00:41:51,226 --> 00:41:52,989
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you were a goner.

383
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:56,758
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. It takes more than one rough landing to kill me.

384
00:41:56,832 --> 00:42:00,131
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom and Dad would be really proud of you.

385
00:42:00,202 --> 00:42:02,762
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the man of the hour, Jim.

386
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:05,204
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, even General Hemmer wants to meet you.

387
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:06,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hemmer?

388
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,704
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}12 dead.

389
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:10,904
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A dozen human beings.

390
00:42:10,979 --> 00:42:14,005
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One tarnished, worn-out security seal

391
00:42:14,082 --> 00:42:18,041
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}way past its recall date, and gone...

392
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,145
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}12 valuable, productive lives.

393
00:42:21,223 --> 00:42:23,748
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How much longer do we have to wait

394
00:42:23,825 --> 00:42:27,283
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}while this tomb crumbles around us?

395
00:42:27,362 --> 00:42:30,354
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When will this council give me the authority

396
00:42:30,432 --> 00:42:32,229
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to do what must be done?

397
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,066
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your plan calls for nothing less than the conquest of Terra...

398
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:39,971
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}an alien world, an occupied world.

399
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:42,009
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My plan, Mr. President,

400
00:42:42,077 --> 00:42:44,875
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}is the only way to salvage our species.

401
00:42:44,946 --> 00:42:47,744
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are dying.

402
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:50,751
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are the last relics of humanity.

403
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:53,379
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The future depends on us.

404
00:42:57,259 --> 00:43:01,093
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will have no future if we repeat the mistakes of the past.

405
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,756
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have superior technology and firepower,

406
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:06,164
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}impenetrable defenses.

407
00:43:06,234 --> 00:43:09,226
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The mistake would be not to act.

408
00:43:09,304 --> 00:43:12,296
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your plan's under consideration, General.

409
00:43:12,374 --> 00:43:14,604
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We will vote on it.

410
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:18,407
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Vote! I ask for action, they vote.

411
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,846
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What can we expect from civilians, sir?

412
00:43:20,916 --> 00:43:22,907
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a good soldier, Stewart,

413
00:43:22,984 --> 00:43:26,044
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and, I understand, a brother of a war hero.

414
00:43:26,121 --> 00:43:29,022
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, sir, but I'm no hero.

415
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At ease, Lieutenant.

416
00:43:31,059 --> 00:43:34,324
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the first man to distinguish himself in this conflict.

417
00:43:34,396 --> 00:43:36,626
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Congratulations.

418
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:39,189
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've had my eye on you for a while.

419
00:43:39,267 --> 00:43:42,293
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}James Stanton, 32nd Airborne.

420
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,099
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many left in the 32nd?

421
00:43:44,172 --> 00:43:45,503
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eight, sir.

422
00:43:45,573 --> 00:43:48,371
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One short of a baseball team.

423
00:43:48,443 --> 00:43:50,104
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me guess.

424
00:43:50,178 --> 00:43:53,204
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oxygen leaks, faulty fuel lines.

425
00:43:53,281 --> 00:43:55,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Engine failure?

426
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:59,217
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tired of watching comrades die for nothing?

427
00:43:59,287 --> 00:44:03,451
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've come a long way. Terra is our prize.

428
00:44:03,525 --> 00:44:05,618
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A jewel hanging in space.

429
00:44:05,694 --> 00:44:09,221
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It has real water, not that chemical junk, and ground.

430
00:44:09,297 --> 00:44:13,199
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God, I'd like to feel steady ground under my feet one day.

431
00:44:13,268 --> 00:44:16,635
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Kids born on the Ark have never seen a blade of grass

432
00:44:16,705 --> 00:44:19,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or heard a bird sing.

433
00:44:19,307 --> 00:44:21,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you met the enemy?

434
00:44:21,142 --> 00:44:23,906
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have encountered the native Terrians, yes, sir.

435
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,204
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are they like?

436
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:28,306
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're an interesting species, sir.

437
00:44:28,383 --> 00:44:30,817
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're peaceful and they're intelligent.

438
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:33,285
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Their lives are filled with art and music.

439
00:44:33,355 --> 00:44:35,414
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I meant, can they fight?

440
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:38,186
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're not going to hit us with paintings, are they?

441
00:44:39,461 --> 00:44:42,021
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I believe they can fight, sir. - Good.

442
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:44,122
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then they'll die with honor.

443
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Giddy.

444
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:27,406
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be afraid. I'll get you out of here.

445
00:45:53,735 --> 00:45:56,101
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mala.

446
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:57,263
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father!

447
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:59,898
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father, I'm so sorry.

448
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:02,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna get you out of here.

449
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! A floater!

450
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,118
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is General Hemmer. Report.

451
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:13,313
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have a Terrian floater in Section D, sir.

452
00:46:13,388 --> 00:46:14,446
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mala.

453
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,325
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get her!

454
00:46:20,762 --> 00:46:22,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you.

455
00:46:31,172 --> 00:46:32,799
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father! Father!

456
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,778
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Father, no!

457
00:46:55,096 --> 00:46:57,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here is your proof that Terrians

458
00:46:57,098 --> 00:46:59,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}are a hostile, murderous species.

459
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:02,299
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two more human lives lost.

460
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,304
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}According to Lieutenant Stanton's report,

461
00:47:04,372 --> 00:47:06,465
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the Terrian was seeking its parent,

462
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:08,338
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one of the abductees.

463
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The lines have been drawn.

464
00:47:10,478 --> 00:47:13,641
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are human, they are alien.

465
00:47:13,715 --> 00:47:16,309
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do not take sides against your own species.

466
00:47:16,384 --> 00:47:18,978
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}General, our species has other options.

467
00:47:19,053 --> 00:47:21,613
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need time to explore, to think,

468
00:47:21,689 --> 00:47:23,657
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before we rush headlong into...

469
00:47:23,725 --> 00:47:26,751
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have no more time.

470
00:47:26,828 --> 00:47:30,025
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have waited patiently for this council to act,

471
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:34,034
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but our people are tired of dying in the rotting hull of this ark!

472
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:38,402
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Therefore, I am assuming command.

473
00:47:38,473 --> 00:47:40,532
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The council is hereby dissolved.

474
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:43,133
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do not have the authority, General!

475
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:47,545
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I sin, let future generations judge me.

476
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:50,175
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But mark this: Only thanks to me

477
00:47:50,251 --> 00:47:52,685
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will there be any future generations.

478
00:47:56,491 --> 00:47:59,324
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Jim, where you going, man?

479
00:47:59,394 --> 00:48:01,385
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is wrong. - Wrong?

480
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,589
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- General Hemmer says... - How can you follow him?

481
00:48:03,665 --> 00:48:06,031
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're soldiers. - I obey my commanding officer.

482
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,466
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, we obey the council.

483
00:48:08,536 --> 00:48:11,869
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lieutenant Stanton, I would like you to join the attack force.

484
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,137
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Respectfully, sir, I refuse.

485
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:17,201
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're our only war hero.

486
00:48:17,278 --> 00:48:19,075
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your duty to lead the way.

487
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,138
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I lived with the Terrians, sir.

488
00:48:21,216 --> 00:48:23,013
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're more like us than you can imagine.

489
00:48:23,084 --> 00:48:24,847
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would it change your decision if I told you

490
00:48:24,919 --> 00:48:29,618
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we only have air on the Ark for another two months?

491
00:48:29,691 --> 00:48:34,253
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is mankind's last hope... the terraformer.

492
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:37,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Currently, it provides sufficient oxygen for the Ark.

493
00:48:37,298 --> 00:48:39,061
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once rooted in Terra's surface,

494
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:42,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}it will convert the planet to breathable air within seven days.

495
00:48:42,737 --> 00:48:44,967
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Seven days, Jim.

496
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:47,837
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very Biblical, don't you think?

497
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:50,935
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Ark will have residual air left for several more weeks,

498
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:53,105
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but within that timeframe,

499
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:55,115
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we will have won ourselves a planet.

500
00:48:55,183 --> 00:48:56,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about the Terrians?

501
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:59,418
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}End hologram.

502
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:02,178
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

503
00:49:02,257 --> 00:49:03,451
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

504
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:04,821
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mala!

00:49:04,892 --> 00:49:06,826
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

506
00:49:06,894 --> 00:49:09,795
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The alien cannot see or hear us. Don't worry.

507
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:12,492
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The air is pressurized for Terrian atmosphere.

508
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:14,296
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It can breathe.

509
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:17,133
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A human, however, cannot.

510
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:19,196
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anybody there?

511
00:49:19,274 --> 00:49:21,708
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

516
00:49:34,455 --> 00:49:37,185
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why? - A test, son.

517
00:49:37,258 --> 00:49:39,692
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The ultimate test. Whose side are you on?

518
00:49:39,761 --> 00:49:40,887
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, say something!

519
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:44,121
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop! You're killing him!

520
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:46,496
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. You are.

521
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,831
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Press that red button, and you can save him.

522
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:51,531
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A demonstration of the terraforming technique will commence.

00:49:51,606 --> 00:49:54,473

00:49:54,542 --> 00:49:56,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Terrian will not.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello! Somebody, please help!

526
00:49:58,313 --> 00:49:59,837
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's gotta be another way.

527
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:03,748
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There isn't. Us or them.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mala, your respirator.

543
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:12,612
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Giddy.

544
00:51:12,687 --> 00:51:14,621
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This way.

545
00:51:16,724 --> 00:51:20,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mala. - You?

546
00:51:20,728 --> 00:51:23,629
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

547
00:51:25,066 --> 00:51:27,034
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mala, hurry.

548
00:51:31,406 --> 00:51:33,397
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Giddy... - Follow me.

549
00:51:33,474 --> 00:51:36,238
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Over there! - This way has a far lower mortality rate.

550
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:37,971
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop 'em!

551
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:57,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mala, use the control stick. Fire missiles... now!

552
00:52:08,609 --> 00:52:09,667
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Incoming missiles!

553
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:24,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mala, stay calm.

554
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:29,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're falling too fast!

555
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:32,824
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prepare to eject.

556
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mala, grab onto my tail.

557
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:44,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no!

558
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:33,155
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. About time you joined us.

559
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:38,121
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Although, now that you're awake, um, I don't really know what to say.

560
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:41,896
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never should've told Doron about the invader.

561
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:45,496
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mala, you're my best friend, and I should've trusted you.

562
00:53:45,573 --> 00:53:46,801
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

563
00:53:46,874 --> 00:53:48,808
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, too.

564
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:56,011
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where's Giddy? - The creature you were with?

565
00:53:56,083 --> 00:53:57,744
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's being held captive by the elders.

566
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,479
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to save him.

567
00:53:59,554 --> 00:54:02,284
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm afraid I can't allow that.

568
00:54:02,356 --> 00:54:03,516
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's a tool of the enemy.

569
00:54:03,591 --> 00:54:06,526
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't release him, but I can take you to him.

570
00:54:09,764 --> 00:54:11,732
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this place?

571
00:54:11,799 --> 00:54:15,701
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our past and possibly our future.

572
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:17,067
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Warships?

573
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:23,309
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We came close to destroying ourselves.

574
00:54:23,377 --> 00:54:28,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A small group of survivors formed the eldership.

575
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:31,481
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They vowed to keep the past a secret

576
00:54:31,552 --> 00:54:34,988
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and build a peaceful future.

577
00:54:35,056 --> 00:54:38,253
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But even gentle beings must defend themselves when attacked.

578
00:54:43,331 --> 00:54:46,266
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've been watching the newcomers,

579
00:54:46,334 --> 00:54:50,168
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but we know nothing of their plans or intentions.

580
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:59,073
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the only one who has been inside and returned.

581
00:54:59,146 --> 00:55:02,343
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I'm not the only one.

582
00:55:02,416 --> 00:55:04,509
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, help.

583
00:55:04,585 --> 00:55:06,485
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Giddy! - Honestly!

584
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:09,387
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you doing to him? - We must dissect it to see how it works.

585
00:55:09,457 --> 00:55:13,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, dear. - He is my friend. He saved my life.

586
00:55:13,194 --> 00:55:16,027
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, Lieutenant Stanton saved your life.

587
00:55:16,097 --> 00:55:19,191
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He ordered me to protect you. - Jim?

588
00:55:20,668 --> 00:55:23,569
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I must say, this is not very pleasant. - Leave him alone!

589
00:55:23,638 --> 00:55:26,106
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need information on the enemy's strength and numbers.

590
00:55:26,173 --> 00:55:30,007
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This machine might hold the answer. - So ask him, don't torture him.

591
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:32,637
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you help us?

592
00:55:32,713 --> 00:55:34,271
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I cannot.

593
00:55:34,348 --> 00:55:35,872
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Earth Force created me.

594
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:38,111
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jim commanded you to protect me.

595
00:55:38,185 --> 00:55:41,018
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Will you disobey his orders? - Negative.

596
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:44,489
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if Earth Force invades, they'll destroy all life on this world,

597
00:55:44,558 --> 00:55:46,685
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}including me.

598
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:49,161
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Affirmative.

599
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:53,564
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So the only way to protect me is to help us defeat Earth Force.

600
00:55:54,735 --> 00:55:58,034
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, if... Mala, l...

601
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:01,097
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lieutenant Stanton...

602
00:56:01,175 --> 00:56:04,406
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your logic is tricky, difficult to compute.

603
00:56:07,715 --> 00:56:09,205
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will protect you.

604
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:20,756
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Jim, look, I'm sorry about what happened

605
00:56:20,828 --> 00:56:22,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the enviro-chamber, but Hemmer said...

606
00:56:22,496 --> 00:56:24,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How can you defend him, even now?

607
00:56:24,832 --> 00:56:26,857
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He said it was the only way

608
00:56:26,934 --> 00:56:31,803
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that we could be sure of your loyalties.

609
00:56:33,007 --> 00:56:34,406
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir!

610
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:37,975
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My apologies, sir.

611
00:56:38,045 --> 00:56:41,537
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe the Terrian must have reprogrammed my robot

612
00:56:41,615 --> 00:56:43,242
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}during our captivity.

613
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:47,617
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like you said, interesting species.

614
00:56:47,688 --> 00:56:50,919
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Full of surprises.

615
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:54,222
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got a few surprises up our sleeve, too.

616
00:56:54,295 --> 00:56:57,093
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're on the terraforming campaign, Lieutenant.

617
00:56:57,164 --> 00:57:00,133
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's an order. - Sir!

618
00:57:04,972 --> 00:57:07,031
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what happened to you on Terra,

619
00:57:07,108 --> 00:57:09,133
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but this is war,

620
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:11,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I'd feel a lot better knowing you had my back.

621
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:14,276
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've always looked out for you, kid.

622
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,213
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always will.

623
00:57:16,283 --> 00:57:19,775
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Question is, will Hemmer?

624
00:58:16,811 --> 00:58:19,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The aliens breathe something called oxygen,

625
00:58:19,847 --> 00:58:21,838
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so our atmosphere is poisonous to them.

626
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:23,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We must strike early while we...

627
00:58:23,517 --> 00:58:25,576
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's where the terraformer should land.

628
00:58:25,653 --> 00:58:28,213
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The formations of oxygen can spread more rapidly

629
00:58:28,289 --> 00:58:31,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to the native population centers, neutralizing them.

630
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:34,227
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Air filters here and here

631
00:58:34,295 --> 00:58:36,286
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}can alter your atmosphere into oxygen...

632
00:58:36,363 --> 00:58:38,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before the enemy can strike the terraformer,

633
00:58:38,232 --> 00:58:42,828
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we must engage and destroy their primitive aerial attack force.

634
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,708
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Men and women of Earth Force,

635
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:53,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you hold the entire future of our species in your hands.

636
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:55,171
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brothers and sisters,

637
00:58:55,249 --> 00:58:57,444
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we are engaged in a struggle for survival.

638
00:58:57,518 --> 00:59:00,885
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not only our own, but for our world.

639
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:05,722
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every living being on our planet depends on us.

640
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:09,456
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we fail, we fail them, too.

641
00:59:10,831 --> 00:59:13,527
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your actions over the next few hours

642
00:59:13,601 --> 00:59:16,399
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will either win ourselves a new home

643
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,904
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or doom us to extinction.

644
00:59:18,973 --> 00:59:21,464
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe... I must believe

645
00:59:21,542 --> 00:59:23,407
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that in our darkest hour,

646
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:27,004
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the very qualities which made us great will make us strong...

647
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:32,212
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that love and mercy can triumph over hate and violence once more.

648
00:59:32,286 --> 00:59:35,278
