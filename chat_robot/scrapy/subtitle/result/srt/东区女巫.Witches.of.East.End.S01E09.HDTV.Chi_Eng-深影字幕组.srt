00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,663
东区女巫前情回顾...
Previously on Witches of East End...

2
00:00:01,697 --> 00:00:03,331
关于她们父亲的事你都说了些什么?
What have you told them about their father?

3
00:00:03,365 --> 00:00:05,249
她们难道没有权利知道他还活着吗?
Don't they have a right to know that he's alive?

4
00:00:05,284 --> 00:00:06,868
可我们永远都不能告诉任何人
We are never, ever going to tell anyone.

5
00:00:06,902 --> 00:00:08,684
你和基利安之间怎么回事? 
What happened between you and Killian?  

6
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:09,370
我们接吻了
We kissed.

7
00:00:09,371 --> 00:00:12,258
一个是你的灵魂伴侣 一个是你的冤家
One man is your soul mate, the other man is your destroyer.

8
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:13,211
弗雷娅
Freya.

9
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:15,991
其实我在挖掘一些神秘的信息...
I'm actually looking for something more about the occult...

10
00:00:15,992 --> 00:00:17,568
巫术 咒语 神灵 
Witchcraft, curses, spirits.

11
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:19,843
貌似是由某种骨组织构成的
It appears to be made of some sort of osseous tissue.

12
00:00:19,844 --> 00:00:23,430
在费尔黑文的地下墓穴里有一整面墙的枝毒
There's an entire wall of Ramus Mortium in the catacombs of Fair Haven.

13
00:00:23,464 --> 00:00:26,049
你到底是谁?
Who the hell are you?

14
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,490
谢谢你 弗雷娅...
Thank you, Freya...

15
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:32,564
- 我的法力消失了 - 什么?
- My powers are gone. - What?

16
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:43,516
带着身体 精神和灵魂
With body, spirit, and soul,

17
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:47,066
让这孩子重归完整
this child again becomes whole.

18
00:00:47,665 --> 00:00:49,299
重塑
Restituo.

19
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:51,093
重生
Nativitas.

20
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,014
重现
Filia.

21
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:56,518
重塑
Restituo.

22
00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:57,650
重生
Nativitas.

23
00:00:57,651 --> 00:00:59,373
重现
Filia.

24
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:29,880
不起作用
It didn't work.

25
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:34,421
也许这个咒语我们根本破不了
Maybe this isn't a spell we can break.

26
00:01:34,422 --> 00:01:37,542
弗雷娅 你的法力不只是被锁定了
Freya, your powers aren't just blocked.

27
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:38,712
它们消失了 弗雷娅 
They're gone, Freya.  

28
00:01:38,713 --> 00:01:39,739
什么 永远都没了?
What, forever?

29
00:01:39,757 --> 00:01:42,759
你们觉得这是假冒者干的吗?
And you think the shifter is the one who took them?

30
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:46,974
塔罗牌显示假冒者的法力不足以直接袭击我们
The tarot said the shifter wasn't powerful enough to come at us directly.

31
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:49,718
但如果假冒者吸走了弗雷娅的法力 
But if the shifter has taken Freya's powers, 

32
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,724
那就不一样了
everything has changed.

33
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:53,212
- 他们会强大得多 - 会有多强?
- They're getting stronger. - How strong?

34
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,399
- 和我们一样 - 甚至会更强
- As strong as we are. - If not more.

35
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:04,154
拜托你告诉我这戏剧性效果是你弄出来的
Please tell me you did that for dramatic effect.

36
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:06,689
事情越来越严重了
Things are getting serious.

37
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:14,730
别担心 女士们 就要结束了
Don't worry, ladies, it's almost over.

38
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,999
东区女巫 第一季第09集

39
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:25,120
发生什么事了
What's happening?

40
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:26,636
我们发现了个咒语  
Oh, we found a spell. 

41
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:27,823
能恢复我的法力?
To get my powers back?

42
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:31,223
不能 但它能帮我们找到假冒者是谁
No, but it'll help us work out who the shifter is.

43
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:33,810
- 怎么做? - 每当一个女巫施咒时
- How? - Every time a witch casts a spell,

44
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:37,677
都会留下一个记号 就像是魔法指纹
it leaves a kind of signature, like a magic fingerprint.

45
00:02:37,678 --> 00:02:39,139
这又是什么意思?  
Oh, what does that mean?  

46
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,186
你可以把它想成DNA式的证据
Just think of it as DNA evidence.

47
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:44,922
没错 也许还能从你的血液里追踪到
Exactly, so the shifter's fingerprint may still be traceable

48
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:45,639
假冒者的指纹 
in your blood, 

49
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,642
我们会把它提取出来
so we're gonna try and draw it out.

50
00:02:46,676 --> 00:02:48,877
- 把手给我 - 哦...
- Give me your hand. - Oh...

51
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:51,847
- 哎呦! - 可能会有点儿疼
- Oh! - This may hurt a little.

52
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:54,283
哎哟! 老天... 哪止一点儿疼?
Ow! Oh, my G... a little?

53
00:02:54,317 --> 00:02:56,972
天哪
Ow, oh, my God.

54
00:02:56,973 --> 00:02:58,840
好了 这些够了
All right, that's enough.

55
00:02:59,022 --> 00:03:01,073
天哪
Oh, my God.

56
00:03:01,374 --> 00:03:02,958
愈合
Consuo.

57
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:07,527
老天爷 真怀念我有魔力的日子
God, I really miss being able to do things like that.

58
00:03:07,528 --> 00:03:09,381
我理解 亲爱的
Aw, I know, honey.

59
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:12,385
好了 再跟我们说一遍 你失去魔法的那天
Okay, one more time, take us through the day you lost them.

60
00:03:12,386 --> 00:03:14,107
不要遗漏任何细节  
And don't leave anything out. 

61
00:03:14,108 --> 00:03:15,828
好 那时候我正在工作
Okay, so I was at work,

62
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:20,398
我收到了鲜花 然后就感到怪怪的 很难受
I had flowers delivered to me, and I started to feel strange, really sick,

63
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:22,849
然后我和佩内洛普回到费尔黑文
and then I went back to Fair Haven with Penelope,

64
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,012
然后我晕过去了 后来达什出现并救了我
and I passed out, and then Dash showed up and saved me.

65
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,064
我知道你也许会觉得那花有问题 
I know you think it's the flowers, 

66
00:03:28,065 --> 00:03:29,318
但也许是别的东西搞得鬼
but maybe it's something else...

67
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:31,028
比如佩内洛普啊 达什啊 
Penelope, Dash.  

68
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:32,006
什么? 不是吧
What? Come on.

69
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:34,156
不 我告诉过你 我很早之前就测试过达什
No, I told you, I tested Dash a long time ago.

70
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,042
他是凡身 不是他 佩内洛普也是
He's mortal, it is not him, and the same with Penelope.

71
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:37,946
不是他们  
They're fine. 

72
00:03:37,947 --> 00:03:40,356
等等 你测试过达什? 为什么呀?
I'm sorry, you tested Dash? Why?

73
00:03:40,357 --> 00:03:43,045
你们进展得太快了
You guys got engaged so quickly

74
00:03:43,046 --> 00:03:45,078
而且你又经常说起这段神秘的恋情
and you kept talking about this mystical love.

75
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:47,582
我当然得确定一下他有没有隐瞒自己的真身
I had to be sure he was who he said he was.

76
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,692
他是我的灵魂伴侣 我们是天注定的 
He's my soul mate. We are destined. 

77
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:51,274
你不是用塔罗牌算过了吗
Come on, you read my tarot.

78
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:53,268
塔罗牌说他可能是灵魂伴侣
The tarot said he might be, 

79
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:55,761
但他也有可能是骗子 是你的劫难
but he could also be the trickster, your destroyer.

80
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:59,128
好吧 不是达什干的 绝对不可能
Okay, Dash did not do this. It is not possible.

81
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,498
我同意
I agree.

82
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:04,883
好了 我得去工作了
Okay, I have to go to work.

83
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:10,600
你什么时候测的佩内洛普?
When did you test Penelope?

84
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:11,868
- 还没呢 - 什么?
- I didn't. - What?

85
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:14,279
但她今晚要来参加彩排晚宴
But she's coming for the rehearsal dinner tonight.

86
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,710
我们可以趁机测试她以及所有其他客人
We can test her then to be sure and all of the other guests.

87
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:19,445
行
Yeah.

88
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:32,781
很遗憾你不来参加婚礼
I'm sorry that you won't be coming to the wedding

89
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:34,950
和彩排晚宴了
or the rehearsal dinner.

90
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:38,197
- 我觉得这样比较好 - 非常赞同
- I think it's best. - I couldn't agree more.

91
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:40,889
达什只是需要点时间
Dash just needs some time.

92
00:04:40,924 --> 00:04:42,093
没关系 
That doesn't matter. 

93
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:45,221
我已经放下了 但一来这儿我还是会感到焦虑
I'm past that. I was getting antsy here anyway.

94
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:47,356
我打算去哥斯达黎加过冬
Going to Costa Rica for the winter.

95
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,942
你知道我在每一个地方都待不久的
You know I can't spend too long in one place.

96
00:04:49,976 --> 00:04:52,707
我们能在婚礼以后再讨论此事吗?
Can't we please discuss this after the wedding?

97
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:57,696
我已经决定了 妈妈 明天下午我就走
Made up my mind, Mom. I'm going tomorrow afternoon.

98
00:04:58,525 --> 00:05:01,226
我保证这次会写信
I promise to write this time.

99
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,624
- 你知道还有个咒语... - 不行
- You know there is one more spell... - No.

100
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,710
- 你都不知道我要说啥 - 你想说
- You didn't know what I was going to say. - You were going to say

101
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:43,536
我应该问问维克托
that I should call Victor 

102
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:44,879
看他能不能恢复弗雷娅的法力
to see if he'll get Freya's powers back.

103
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,136
不 我没想说这个...
No, I wasn't...

104
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,234
- 不过你应该试试 - 不可能...
- But you should. - There's no way...

105
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:51,146
那咒语可能有用 乔  
The spell could work, Jo.  

106
00:05:51,147 --> 00:05:53,405
也可能没用啊 根本不能保证
And it could not. There's no guarantee.

107
00:05:53,406 --> 00:05:56,064
维克托是个医生 我相信他知道怎样做安全
Victor is a doctor, I'm sure he knows how to do it safely.

108
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:58,700
抱歉 不值得冒这个险
I'm sorry, it's just not worth taking the risk.

109
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:07,137
色调有点单一呢
It's a little monochromatic.

110
00:06:07,272 --> 00:06:08,906
这什么意思?
What does it mean?

111
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:11,924
这是我第一次尝试这个咒语
This is the first time I've ever done this spell,

112
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:13,526
魔法书里说
but according to the Grimoire,

113
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,612
指纹会慢慢地浮到表面
the fingerprint slowly rises to the surface,

114
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:19,899
希望我们能找出我们的敌人是谁
and hopefully we'll know who our enemy is.

115
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:23,604
给你
Here you go.

116
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:33,417
这就是吗?
Is that it?

117
00:06:38,785 --> 00:06:41,453
你看起来美若天仙
You look unbelievable.

118
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:42,974
真的吗...?  
Really...?  

119
00:06:42,975 --> 00:06:44,644
裙子完美 你也完美
It's perfect. You look perfect.

120
00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:46,068
所有事都是完美的 
Everything is perfect.  

121
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:47,333
不是每件事都完美
Everything is not perfect.

122
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:50,622
有个变形人悄悄接近我们偷走了我的法力
There's a shape-shifter moving in on us and I've lost my powers.

123
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,484
妈妈和温迪可以解决变形人的问题
Mom and Wendy will handle the shifter,

124
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:56,986
我知道这听起来有点儿 额...
and I know this may sound, um...

125
00:06:56,987 --> 00:06:58,726
你有没有觉得失去法力
Have you ever thought that losing your powers 

126
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:00,639
对你来说其实是件好事?
is actually for the best?

127
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:02,241
额 不觉得
Um, no.

128
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:04,309
自从你发现了我们的身份
Ever since you found out who you are,

129
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:06,646
你就备受折磨 因为你必须向达什隐瞒这件事
you've been tortured because you couldn't tell Dash.

130
00:07:06,663 --> 00:07:08,525
而你不想骗他 不是吗?  
You hated lying to him, right?  

131
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:09,815
那当然 可是...
Of course, but...

132
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,784
现在你再也不用撒谎了
Now you don't have to lie anymore.

133
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:14,276
- 你可以完全做你自己 - 不
- You are who you are. - No.

134
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:16,523
我感觉不对 很空虚 
I feel wrong, empty, 

135
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:19,291
就好像我丢了一部分自己一样
like I'm missing a piece of myself.

136
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:22,443
嘿 这里越来越...
Hey, it's getting pretty...

137
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:32,888
我在外面等你
I will meet you back out there.

138
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:42,095
我猜你没有收到周五便装日的备忘
I guess you didn't get the memo about Casual Friday.

139
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:44,714
我只是试一下
I was just trying it on.

140
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:48,537
我明天就结婚了 我们把婚礼提前了
I'm getting married tomorrow. We moved up the wedding.

141
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:50,039
是啊 我知道 我听说了
Yeah, I know, I heard.

142
00:07:50,073 --> 00:07:52,347
我知道我应该跟你说一声的
I know I probably should have said something to you.

143
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:54,960
我只是真的很忙 忙着规划
I've just been really busy and planning

144
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:57,223
忙着在最后一刻把所有事都准备好
and getting everything together at the last minute

145
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:59,865
准备食物啊 花啊 蜜月啊...
with the food, the flowers, the honeymoon...

146
00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:02,695
我们会去巴黎 那应该会很有趣 
We're going to Paris, which should be really fun. 

147
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:04,570
我又在闲扯了 是吧?
I'm rambling, aren't I?

148
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:06,572
- 对 我又在闲扯了 - 一点点
- Yep, I am. - Ah, just a little.

149
00:08:06,597 --> 00:08:08,054
好吧...
Yeah...

150
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:11,604
总之 我们不想再等了
Anyway, we just didn't want to wait anymore.

151
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:13,973
当你觉得是时候了 就是时候了
I guess when you know, you know.

152
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:21,864
那祝贺你 我想这一切都会很棒的
Well, congratulations. I think it's all gonna be great.

153
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:23,616
谢谢你 基利安
Thank you, Killian.

154
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,570
好吧 我先出去了
Okay, I will see you out there.

155
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:29,772
如果我是你 我会先换掉衣服
Oh, but I'd get changed first if I were you.

156
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,559
好
Yeah.

157
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,623
艾米 我是达什
Amy, it's Dash.

158
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:51,477
听着 我又来地下墓穴了 那些枝毒都不见了
Listen, I'm down in the catacombs again, and those branches are gone,

159
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:53,930
现在这又有一种奇怪的液态金属
but there's a strange liquid metal here now.

160
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:57,154
你三点左右能来这里见我吗?
You want to meet me here around, say, 3:00

161
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:59,569
你可以看看这里的情况给我点专业意见
so you can take a look at this and give me your expert opinion?

162
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:01,209
好的 谢谢
All right, thanks.

163
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:18,741
我一直在找你呢
I've been looking for you.

164
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,065
我现在有点忙
I'm a little busy right now.

165
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:22,491
这里没人啊
There's no one even here.

166
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:25,327
就给我一分钟 我保证你会喜欢的
Just give me a minute. I promise you'll like it.

167
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:26,629
看
Look.

168
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:30,473
我已经给你看过了地图 但这还有更多
So I showed you the map already, but there's more,

169
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:31,934
多得多
a lot more.

170
00:09:31,969 --> 00:09:34,544
我爸的日记巨多
My father had tons of these diaries.

171
00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:36,773
他每月都会写完一本
He filled one up every month.

172
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:44,995
这么多史料 你找到了我的弱点
So much history. You've found my weak spot.

173
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,457
越往后看就越神秘
They get somewhat more cryptic as it goes on.

174
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,118
到结尾的时候他都开始失控了
He started losing it towards the end.

175
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:51,186
这是他去世前写的那本
That's the one he was keeping write before he died.

176
00:09:51,204 --> 00:09:53,539
看看最后几页
Check out the last few pages.

177
00:09:57,357 --> 00:09:59,328
"英德尚格波丽"?
"A parching imbued"?

178
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:02,055
这是什么意思?
What does that mean?

179
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,844
我想这是密码 我感觉这好像和仙宫有关联
I think it's a code. I feel like it's connected to Asgard somehow,

180
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:09,722
我需要你帮我弄明白它 英格丽德
but I need your help to figure it out, Ingrid.

181
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:13,059
让我们创造历史吧 我们可以一起做这事
Let's make history. We can do this together.

182
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:15,399
为什么是我?
Why me?

183
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:18,597
因为你是女巫
Because you're a witch.

184
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:30,236
我不是女巫
I'm not a witch.

185
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:32,247
这里举行慈善活动时我见过你 
I saw you at the charity event right here. 

186
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:33,970
有个家伙开始对你毛手毛脚
That guy started getting rough with you.

187
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:36,763
你说了些拉丁语 他的手指就断了
You said some words in Latin. His fingers just broke.

188
00:10:36,764 --> 00:10:40,033
这就是你的证据吗? 想象力真丰富啊
That is your evidence? You have a very vivid imagination.

189
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:42,618
如果我错了 你为什么逃跑呢?
If I'm wrong, then why are you running away?

190
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:44,169
我有工作要做!
I have work to do!

191
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:01,614
嘿 过来
Hey. Come here.

192
00:11:04,151 --> 00:11:06,502
好了 看看这
Okay, check this out.

193
00:11:06,537 --> 00:11:08,588
就在这
Right here.

194
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,736
明天我们就从这开始我们的新生活了
This is where we start our new life tomorrow.

195
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:15,033
真的要发生了 感觉好不真实 
It just feels so surreal that it's actually happening.

196
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:18,700
是否感觉我向你求婚是很久之前的事了
Does feel like forever ago when I asked you to marry me.

197
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:21,069
我可以坦白一下吗?
Can I make a confession?

198
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:23,567
我从未想过要结婚
I never wanted to get married.

199
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:25,135
什么?
What?

200
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,722
我总觉得婚姻很... 传统
I just always thought marriage was too... conventional

201
00:11:28,757 --> 00:11:30,808
还很无聊 很平常
and boring and normal.

202
00:11:30,842 --> 00:11:32,959
是人生中任何冒险活动的终结
The end of any adventure in life.

203
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:36,954
- 我应该担心吗? - 直到我遇见你
- Should I be getting worried? - Until I met you.

204
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:41,769
然后我意识到婚姻不仅仅是篱笆小院和小货车
And I realized that marriage is more than a picket fence and a minivan.

205
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:45,272
它是和你爱的人分享你的生活
It's about sharing your life with someone you love.

206
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:50,703
你知道吗 作为一个环游过世界的人
You know, as someone who's been all over the world,

207
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:53,497
我... 我实话说
I... I can honestly say,

208
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:55,783
这一切 当下的这一切...
this, this right here...

209
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:58,985
这次探险是我最期待的
this is the adventure I'm most looking forward to.

210
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,238
我也是
Me, too.

211
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:18,425
哟 这不是维克托嘛
Well, well, well, if it isn't Victor.

212
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:21,587
- 温迪...? - 正是在下
- Wendy...? - In the flesh.

213
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:23,858
我得多久没见过你了...
Wow. I haven't seen you in...

214
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:26,067
很久了 别算了
A long time. Let's not put a number on it.

215
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:27,685
你来这做什么呢 温迪?
So what are you doing here, Wendy?

216
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:29,806
我以为波尚家族的人都恨我
I thought all the Beauchamps officially hated me.

217
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:32,659
我们确实恨你 但我们也需要你的帮助
We do officially hate you, but we also need your help.

218
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,720
弗雷娅需要你的帮助 
Well, Freya needs your help. 

219
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:34,888
你还记得弗雷娅是谁吧?
You do remember who Freya is, right?

220
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,939
等下 乔安娜知道你在这吗?  
Wait. Does Joanna know you're here? 

221
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,897
我们讨论过这事
We discussed it.

222
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:39,535
那 出了什么事?  
So, what's the problem?  

223
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:41,138
弗雷娅失去了她的法力
Freya's lost her powers.

224
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:43,803
确切地说 某人夺走了它们
Well, to be more precise, somebody's taken them,

225
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,643
我们尝试了一切我们能想到的 除了一件事
and we've tried everything we can think of except one thing.

226
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:49,639
- 不 不 不 绝对不行 - 让我讲完
- No. No. No. Absolutely not. - Let me finish.

227
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,378
我已经很久不行医了也很久没做那种事了
Look, I haven't practiced medicine or done that kind of thing in a long time.

228
00:12:53,748 --> 00:12:57,068
我现在是教授 我更喜欢历史和学术活动
I'm a professor now. I'm more into history, academics.

229
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:00,038
但我肯定你还记得怎么做
But I'm sure you can remember how to do it.

230
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:05,038
你知道你在要求什么 对吗?
You do know what you're asking, right?

231
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,078
如果这不重要 我就不会来这儿了
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't important.

232
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,481
还有 这里面还有更多的故事 就给我五分钟
Plus, there is way more to the story. Just give me five minutes.

233
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,865
很快了...
Soon...

234
00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:21,319
妈咪嘛咪哄
Reformabit verum.

235
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:33,620
达什 嘿 我... 我来得有点早了...
Dash, hey. I, uh... I got here a little early...

236
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:35,488
我在这等着你
I'll just see you when you get here.

237
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:44,454
妈咪嘛咪哄
Veniat ad me metalli.

238
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:49,093
妈咪嘛咪哄
Veniat ad me metalli.

239
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:51,053
加德纳夫人?
Mrs. Gardiner?

240
00:14:51,071 --> 00:14:53,889
艾米 你怎么来了?
Amy. What are you doing here?

241
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:55,557
达什约了我在这见面
I'm supposed to be meeting Dash.

242
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,559
我真心觉得你不该碰那东西
I really don't think you should touch that.

243
00:14:57,577 --> 00:14:59,995
为什么? 你觉得这很危险吗?
Why? Do you think it's dangerous?

244
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,314
很有可能 我们还不知道那是什么
It might be. We don't know what it is.

245
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:04,111
达什和我一直在调查 但...
Dash and I have been investigating, but...

246
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,671
事实上 它是种毒药
Actually, it's a poison,

247
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,382
它是从另一个世界渗透穿墙而来的
and it's seeping through the wall from another world.

248
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:13,012
有这个可能
That's certainly a theory. 

249
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,847
这是个事实 亲爱的
It's a fact, dear.

250
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:18,247
好在 它对凡人是致命的
Good thing, it's lethal to mortals.

251
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:41,871
艾米?
Amy?

252
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,496
妈妈 天呐 你吓我一跳 你怎么来了?
Mom. Oh, my God, you scared me. What are you doing here?

253
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:19,152
我不是你的母亲
I'm not your mother.

254
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,020
妈咪嘛咪哄
Mitte.

255
00:16:26,643 --> 00:16:29,516
天呐 请别这样
Oh, God, please. Don't.

256
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:33,750
- 救命! 不! - 闭... 嘴
- Help! No! - Shut... up.

257
00:16:37,882 --> 00:16:39,332
真漂亮
So pretty.

258
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:42,375
天呐
Oh, my God.

259
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,995
帮我给你母亲带个话儿
Give your mother a message from me.

260
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:50,731
妈咪嘛咪哄
Per mortem argenteum.

261
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,058
弗雷娅?
Freya?

262
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:13,002
妈妈 假冒者刚来过酒吧
Mom. The shifter was just here at the bar.

263
00:17:13,003 --> 00:17:14,824
- 你没事吧? - 嗯 我没事
- Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm all right.

264
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:17,526
她刚走 我还可以看到她 她到第四街道去了
She just left, though. I can see her. She's headed down Fourth Street.

265
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:19,329
待在弯曲手肘
Stay at the Bent Elbow.

266
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,068
那 你怎么看? 你能做吗?
So, what do you think? Can you do it?

267
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:33,423
能 不过很危险 
Yes, but it's dangerous, 

268
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:35,571
我们需要乔安娜参与才能完成
and we need Joanna to pull it off.

269
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:38,802
没有她的话能完成吗?
Ooh. Um, can we do it without her?

270
00:18:38,803 --> 00:18:41,544
这样就容易多了 我能代替她吗?
I mean, it would be so much easier. Can I do it for her?

271
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,586
不 必须得是乔安...
No, it has to be Joann...

272
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:47,417
温迪?
Wendy?

273
00:18:47,451 --> 00:18:50,549
- 怎么? - 你跟我说她知道我要来
- What? - You told me she knew I was coming.

274
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,425
不 我没说 我说我们讨论过了
No, I didn't. I said that we discussed it.

275
00:18:53,459 --> 00:18:56,327
讨论的结果是她不让我找你
And the discussion ended with her telling me not to find you.

276
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,968
- 她什么时候回来? - 我不知道
- When is she getting back? - I don't know.

277
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:01,140
不如你在我屋子里等等吧
But it might be a good idea for you to wait in my room.

278
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,033
我可能需要慢慢告诉她 不 等等!
I might need to break it to her gently. No, wait! Oh.

279
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:05,952
- 这根本不是个好主意 - 你不能走
- This is not a good idea at all. - You can't leave.

280
00:19:05,953 --> 00:19:08,705
你向我保证过 我们说好了的
You made me a promise. We had a deal.

281
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,068
现在到我屋里去!
Now go to my room!

282
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:35,868
迈克 我们要关门了 你得走了
Mike. We're closed. You need to leave.

283
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:37,408
"英德尚格波丽." 我知道这是什么意思
"A parching imbued." I know what it means.

284
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,546
- 我不关心 - 这是字母易位词
- I don't care. - It's an anagram.

285
00:19:39,547 --> 00:19:40,256
你该走了  
It's time for you to leave.  

286
00:19:40,257 --> 00:19:41,912
它的意思是"英格丽德・波尚"
It means "Ingrid Beauchamp."

287
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:44,631
我不知道你在说什么 我也不想知道
I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't want to know.

288
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:46,558
要是你改变"英德尚格波丽"的字母顺序
If you rearrange the letters of "A Parching Imbued,"

289
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,990
就可以拼出你的名字... 英格丽德・波尚
it spells your name... Ingrid Beauchamp.

290
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:52,174
我跟你说了 我们要关门了 你得马上离开
I told you. We are closed. You need to leave right now.

291
00:19:52,175 --> 00:19:53,564
问题是 在我父亲的日记里
Question is, why would my father 

292
00:19:53,565 --> 00:19:55,417
为什么会有你名字的字母易位词呢?
have an anagram of your name in his diary?

293
00:19:55,418 --> 00:19:57,456
- 好了 我要叫警察了 - 不 你不会的
- Okay, I'm gonna call the police. - No, you're not.

294
00:19:57,457 --> 00:19:59,191
上次在图书馆被我赶走的那个家伙
What did you say happened to the last guy

295
00:19:59,192 --> 00:20:00,304
还记得他怎么样了... 
who cornered me in the library... 

296
00:20:00,305 --> 00:20:01,231
他的手指怎么样了吗?
something about broken fingers?

297
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:02,743
一点儿不差 因为你用咒语做到的 
Exactly, 'cause you broke it with a spell, 

298
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:03,499
因为你就是个女巫
because you are a witch.

299
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,851
好了 你在骚扰我 我要叫警察了
Okay. Now you're harassing me. I'm calling the police.

300
00:20:05,852 --> 00:20:08,091
要是你承认事实 我们就可以继续了
If you just admit the truth, we can move on.

301
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:10,456
- 我不是女巫! - 我知道你在隐藏秘密
- I am not a witch! - I know you're sworn to secrecy.

302
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:13,005
我父亲连续几年研究你们的文化 我知道密码
My father studied your culture for years. I know about the code.

303
00:20:13,006 --> 00:20:15,740
根本没有密码! 我不知道你在说什么
There is no code! I don't know what you're talking about.

304
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:17,348
好吧
Fine.

305
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:21,568
我来证明一下
I'll prove it.

306
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,882
天哪!
Oh, my God!

307
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,828
迈克!
Mike!

308
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:33,036
我觉得特别无助 太恐怖了
I just felt completely defenseless. It was awful.

309
00:20:33,037 --> 00:20:35,322
然后她告诉我给你捎个信
And then she told me to give you a message.

310
00:20:35,323 --> 00:20:37,424
妈咪嘛咪哄?
Per mortem argenteum?

311
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,852
什么? 这是什么意思?
What? What does that mean?

312
00:20:39,853 --> 00:20:42,035
意思是我们得恢复你的能力
It means we need to get your powers back.

313
00:20:42,036 --> 00:20:44,047
可是你和温迪都说了这是不可能的啊
But you and Wendy both said there was no way.

314
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:46,713
还有一种可能
Mm, there's still one possibility.

315
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,296
这太疯狂了! 你为什么要这么做?!
This is insane! Why are you doing this?!

316
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,899
你得马上把我治好 要不我就会流血致死了
You need to heal me right now, or I'm gonna bleed to death.

317
00:20:56,242 --> 00:20:57,279
我知道你能做到... 
I know you can do it... 

318
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,505
每个女巫都有疗伤的能力
every witch has healing power.

319
00:20:58,506 --> 00:21:00,971
我不会治好你 你才不关心你的死活
I'm not healing you. I don't care if you die.

320
00:21:00,972 --> 00:21:03,106
你应该不想向警察解释这些吧
I don't think you want to explain this to the police.

321
00:21:03,141 --> 00:21:05,721
你能解释啊! 我要打911!
You can explain it! I'll just call 911!

322
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,857
医务人员到这里之前我就死了
I'll be dead before the paramedics get here.

323
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,200
求你... 治好我吧
Just... heal me.

324
00:21:10,201 --> 00:21:13,355
- 你疯了 你知道吗? - 我已经决定了
- You are insane, do you know that? - I'm determined.

325
00:21:13,553 --> 00:21:16,116
我到这里来是找去仙宫的路 
I came here to find the way to Asgard, 

326
00:21:16,117 --> 00:21:17,892
来完成我父亲的工作
to finish my father's life work.

327
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:20,311
不过没有你我做不到
But I can't do it without you.

328
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,424
我需要你 英格丽德
I need you, Ingrid.

329
00:21:22,686 --> 00:21:25,104
求你了 不要让我在这里死掉
Please, don't let me die here.

330
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:35,380
我以前从没有治疗过别人 
I've never even healed anyone before. 

331
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:36,961
我不确定这有没有用
I'm not sure if this will work.

332
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,629
至少 我们在进步了...
We're making some progress, at least...

333
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:41,248
- 你已经承认了 - 我没承认
- You're admitting something. - I admit nothing.

334
00:21:44,285 --> 00:21:48,639
妈咪嘛咪哄
Haec vulnera sanaret lunaticus est scriptor.

335
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:52,979
医治 医治 医治 医治 医治 医治 
Sana, sana, sana. Sana, sana, sana.

336
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,534
医治 医治 医治 
Sana, sana, sana.

337
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:59,193
医治 医治 医治 
Sana, sana, sana.

338
00:22:03,628 --> 00:22:05,846
这... 太不可思议了
That... was incredible.

339
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:11,990
去死吧
Go to hell.

340
00:22:22,585 --> 00:22:24,035
嘿
Hey.

341
00:22:24,053 --> 00:22:26,332
弗雷娅被假冒者攻击了
Freya got attacked by the shifter.

342
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,328
什么?! 你还好吗?  
What?! Are you okay? 

343
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:29,492
嗯 我现在好了
Yeah, I'm okay now.

344
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:33,257
她给我带了个话 妈咪嘛咪哄
She sent me a message. Per mortem argenteum.

345
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,978
不是吧
No.

346
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,350
好吧 这是什么意思? 肯定不是好事
Okay, what does this mean? It can't be good.

347
00:22:37,351 --> 00:22:40,069
我只认识一个意思是"死亡"的词
The only word I understand there means "death."

348
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:42,364
我想我们需要叫维克托过来
I think we need to call Victor.

349
00:22:42,398 --> 00:22:45,200
对 完全同意
Yeah. I totally agree.

350
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:46,785
维克托!
Victor!

351
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,352
搞什么?
What the hell?

352
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,317
想想我们节省了多少时间吧
Just think of all the time we just saved.

353
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:52,889
谁是维克托?
Who is Victor?

354
00:22:58,831 --> 00:23:01,249
真的是你
It's really you.

355
00:23:01,283 --> 00:23:03,084
妈妈 这是谁?
Mom, who is this?

356
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:06,874
他是你父亲
He's your father.

357
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:26,126
嘿 对不起
Hey. I'm sorry.

358
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,194
我知道这有点突然
I'm sure that really felt like an ambush.

359
00:23:28,212 --> 00:23:30,830
我发誓我不知道他在这儿
I swear I did not know that he was here.

360
00:23:30,864 --> 00:23:33,366
那就是我父亲
That's my father in there.

361
00:23:33,384 --> 00:23:36,669
我父亲... 我曾经见过的父亲
My father... who I've never met,

362
00:23:36,703 --> 00:23:40,306
在我出生前就离开的父亲... 就在这里
who left before I was born... is here.

363
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:41,841
他就在我家厨房
He's in my kitchen.

364
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,761
我本不想让你们以这种方式见面
I didn't want you to meet him like this.

365
00:23:47,565 --> 00:23:49,015
弗雷娅?
Freya?

366
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:52,533
- 我能跟你聊聊吗? - 不用了 她没事
- Can I talk to you? - Nah, she's fine.

367
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,158
不 妈妈 没事的 给我们点时间吧 好吗?
No, Mom, it's okay. Just give us a second, okay?

368
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:08,368
- 她保护意识很强 - 她一直都这样
- She's protective. - She always was.

369
00:24:11,881 --> 00:24:13,560
听着 我知道你在想什么
Look, I know what you're thinking.

370
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:16,396
我觉得你不知道 你根本就不了解我
I don't think you do. You don't even know me.

371
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,745
我不知道... 我现在什么感觉
I have no idea... How I'm feeling right now.

372
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,610
我一辈子都在想你是谁 你在哪里
My whole life I've wondered who you were, where you were,

373
00:24:26,978 --> 00:24:29,105
然后你就突然
and now you just show up,

374
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:32,358
在我婚礼的前一天出现在我家
in my house, the day before my wedding.

375
00:24:32,393 --> 00:24:34,894
我从来不会掌握时机
Timing was never my thing.

376
00:24:34,928 --> 00:24:36,262
对
Yeah.

377
00:24:37,216 --> 00:24:40,116
可我已经来了 弗雷娅 我...
Look, but I'm here now, Freya, and I...

378
00:24:40,724 --> 00:24:42,356
我想帮助你
I'd like to help you.

379
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,937
要是你愿意的话
If you'll let me.

380
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:52,124
你知道这个咒语是很痛苦的
You need to know this spell can be very painful.

381
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,877
你会感觉你的身体内部被扭曲了
Your body will feel like it's being twisted from within.

382
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,129
到底是什么?
And what is it, exactly?

383
00:24:57,548 --> 00:24:58,915
就像一次输血
It's like a transfusion.

384
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,833
需要你的父母都给你他们的血
It requires both parents to give you their blood.

385
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:03,869
不过任何跟血有关的医学咒语都很危险
But any medical spell that mixes blood is dangerous.

386
00:25:03,887 --> 00:25:06,004
而这个甚至更冒险
And this one is even more risky, because of

387
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,056
因为它得很强烈才能起作用
how strong it needs to be in order for it to work.

388
00:25:08,057 --> 00:25:09,899
没有其他的办法了吗?
And there's no other way to do it?

389
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,072
我真的希望有 
I really hoped there was, 

390
00:25:11,073 --> 00:25:13,920
不过维克托和我考虑过其他所有可能性
but Victor and I have looked at every other possibility

391
00:25:13,921 --> 00:25:15,922
这是唯一可行的办法
and this is the only one that remains.

392
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:18,965
我看过这个咒语起作用 所以这是合理的
I've seen this spell work. So it is possible.

393
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:20,262
合理也很危险 
But possible and dangerous, 

394
00:25:20,263 --> 00:25:22,834
所以如果你有其他的方案...
so if you are having second thoughts...

395
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:24,762
不 就这么办吧
No. I'm doing it.

396
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,447
裂痕
Lacera.

397
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:41,006
裂痕
Lacera.

398
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,545
裂痕
Lacera.

399
00:25:54,105 --> 00:25:55,639
融合
Concorporo.

400
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,558
没关系 她没事的 乔安娜
No, she's fine, Joanna.

401
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:01,593
我让你停你再停 好吗?
Just don't let go until I tell you, okay?

402
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:04,100
- 天哪... - 弗雷娅...
- Oh... oh, God... - Freya...

403
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:06,353
这只是过程的一部分 没事的
This is just part of the process. It's okay.

404
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:09,131
天哪 快停下!
Oh, God, make it stop!

405
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,000
维克托 有问题 我能感觉出来
Victor, something's wrong; I can feel it.

406
00:26:11,026 --> 00:26:12,512
不 我们快完成了 她没事的 
No. We're almost there. She's fine. 

407
00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:13,892
没事 我以前碰到过这种情况
It's okay, I've seen this before.

408
00:26:13,893 --> 00:26:15,978
我们的血液在压制她自己的血液 没事的
Our blood is overpowering her own. It's okay.

409
00:26:15,979 --> 00:26:18,276
- 爸爸! - 有问题!
- Daddy! - Something not right!

410
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:20,563
- 她快不行了! - 救命啊!
- She's slipping away! - Oh, God!

411
00:26:20,564 --> 00:26:22,409
- 求求你们停下! - 马上就好
- Please make it stop! - Just wait.

412
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,411
- 马上好... - 够了 维克托!
- Just wait... - Let go, Victor!

413
00:26:26,927 --> 00:26:29,254
该死的 乔安娜! 只要...
Damn it, Joanna! Just...

414
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:33,308
怎么了? 成功了吗?
What happened? Did it work?

415
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:34,572
弗雷娅 很抱歉 
Freya, I am so sorry. 

416
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:37,340
我只是 我不能... 我不能冒这个险
I just, I couldn't... I couldn't risk it.

417
00:26:37,341 --> 00:26:38,814
太危险了
It was too dangerous,

418
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:39,837
只要你活着 
and I would rather have you alive 

419
00:26:39,838 --> 00:26:42,310
我宁愿你没有魔法也不希望...
with no powers than...

420
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:44,974
弗雷娅 等等
Freya, please wait.

421
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,089
- 嗨 - 嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

422
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:07,517
- 难熬的一天 - 你根本想不到
- Ugh. Rough day. - You have no idea.

423
00:27:07,518 --> 00:27:09,842
- 我觉得我要赢了 - 我打赌你赢不了
- I think I'm gonna win. - I bet you don't.

424
00:27:09,843 --> 00:27:12,774
我今天在图书馆和迈克一起
I had the most intense situation

425
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:14,722
出了特别棘手的状况
at the library today with this guy, Mike...

426
00:27:14,723 --> 00:27:16,340
我今天见到我们的爸爸了
I met our father today.

427
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,389
- 什么? - 我见到他了
- What? - I met him.

428
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:21,006
他还活着
He's real.

429
00:27:21,024 --> 00:27:24,309
他是哥伦比亚大学的历史教授
He's a history professor at Columbia.

430
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:26,845
你和他蛮像的
He looks like you.

431
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,851
那很不错
Well, good for him.

432
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:34,870
你这是什么意思?
What does that mean?

433
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:37,956
我是说我一点都不想见他
It means I have no interest in meeting him.

434
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:40,340
永远都不想见 他离开了我们 弗雷娅 
Ever. He left us, Freya, 

435
00:27:40,341 --> 00:27:40,993
从没回来过
and never came back.

436
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:43,629
但你一点都不好奇吗?
But aren't you just a little bit curious?

437
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,964
你从没想过他长什么样?
Haven't you always wondered what he was like?

438
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:47,549
当然有过
Sure.

439
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,551
很久很久以前
A long time ago.

440
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:52,721
我曾经幻想有一天放学回家
I used to fantasize about coming home from school one day,

441
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:55,089
他会坐在门口
and he would be sitting on the front porch

442
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,559
拿着书 玩具和礼物
with books and presents and toys,

443
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,459
然后... 他会拥抱我
and... he would hug me 

444
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,186
然后我们一起吃冰淇淋
and we would eat ice cream together

445
00:28:01,187 --> 00:28:02,855
还熬夜看电影
and stay up late watching movies.

446
00:28:02,856 --> 00:28:05,726
但是我从小到大都没享受过这种生活 
But then I outgrew all of that. 

447
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:06,739
一件事都没有
All of it.

448
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:10,939
他不想认识我们 弗雷娅 我也不想认识他
He didn't want to know us, Freya. I don't want to know him.

449
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:15,060
好吧 但我想了解他
Well, I'd like to get to know him.

450
00:28:16,746 --> 00:28:19,581
行吧 那... 那是你的决定
Okay. Well, that's... that's your decision.

451
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:24,810
- 好吧 我们别谈这个了 - 嗯 好主意
- Okay, let's not talk about this. - Yeah. Good reveal.

452
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:27,017
告诉我你和迈克之间发生了什么  
Tell me about what happened with Mike.  

453
00:28:27,018 --> 00:28:29,086
没什么的... 这一点都不重要
No, it's not... it's not that important.

454
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:31,814
嗨 弗雷娅 你准备度蜜月了 
Hey, Freya, between you going on your honeymoon 

455
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:33,178
基利安也要离开
and Killand taking off,

456
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,872
我需要一些人手来这里帮忙
I'm gonna need some help around here.

457
00:28:34,873 --> 00:28:36,059
要是你知道有人...  
So if you know anybody...  

458
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,049
等等 不好意思...
Wait, I'm sorry...

459
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,818
你说什么 基利安要走?
What do you mean, Killian's taking off?

460
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:40,255
- 他没告诉你吗? - 没有
- He didn't tell you? - No.

461
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:42,887
基利安明天就走 坐船去哥斯达黎加
Killian's leaving tomorrow. Sailing to Costa Rica.

462
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:46,291
所以... 我希望你早点回来
So... I hope you'll be back soon.

463
00:28:48,358 --> 00:28:49,904
喂
Hey.

464
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,076
也许这是最好的结局 
Maybe it's for the best. 

465
00:28:52,077 --> 00:28:54,320
你和达什可以重新开始
I mean, you and Dash, you get a clean start.

466
00:28:55,355 --> 00:28:57,556
- 是啊 - 是的
- Yeah. - Yeah.

467
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:01,794
我们得去彩排晚宴了
We have a rehearsal dinner to get to.

468
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:03,269
好的
Okay.

469
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,007
谢谢你
Thank you.

470
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:16,976
来一杯
Drink up.

471
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,978
谢谢
Oh. Oh, thank you.

472
00:29:19,012 --> 00:29:21,013
你们也来一杯吧 
Here you go, guys.

473
00:29:22,382 --> 00:29:23,850
好
Great.

474
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:28,668
有东西开始在布上显现出来了
Something's beginning to form on the canvas.

475
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:30,164
我还没法让它显现出来 
I can't quite make it out yet, 

476
00:29:30,165 --> 00:29:31,524
但好像马上就出现了
but it looks like it's coming soon.

477
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:32,858
大家都准备好了吗?  
Are we all ready here?  

478
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:33,922
是 每个人都有一杯
Yep. Everyone has a glass.

479
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,932
好的 大家都有香槟了 我们来敬酒吧
All right, now that everybody's got champagne, let's have a toast.

480
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:39,601
当然了 我最喜欢了  
Oh, of course. I'd love to.  

481
00:29:39,602 --> 00:29:41,269
我还真是一点也不惊讶呢
Why am I not surprised?

482
00:29:41,287 --> 00:29:43,238
放松... 就说几句
Oh, relax... it's just a few words.

483
00:29:46,575 --> 00:29:48,330
好了...
Well...

484
00:29:48,577 --> 00:29:52,630
今天我们欢聚一堂
It's taken a series of fortunate events to bring us all here today.

485
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:57,585
当我第一次发现东区和费尔黑文 我就知道
When I first discovered East End and Fair Haven, I knew this was the place

486
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,454
这是我一直寻找的地方
that I'd always been searching for.

487
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:03,088
当达什遇见了弗雷娅 
And then when Dash met Freya, 

488
00:30:03,089 --> 00:30:06,356
我不禁想 " 我怎么可以这么幸运? "
I thought, "Could I really be so lucky?"

489
00:30:06,657 --> 00:30:09,341
因为我知道我不仅有了弗雷娅这个儿媳妇
Because I knew I wasn't just getting Freya,

490
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:12,459
我还结识了整个波尚家族
I was getting all the Beauchamps.

491
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,842
真是一份极好的礼物
What a gift.

492
00:30:13,843 --> 00:30:15,979
来让我们举杯...
So raise a glass...

493
00:30:16,697 --> 00:30:20,784
祝福你们有一个让所有人难忘的婚礼
To a wedding no one will ever forget.

494
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:24,973
- 干杯 - 干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

495
00:30:25,322 --> 00:30:27,791
干杯
Cheers.

496
00:30:29,601 --> 00:30:33,075
太棒了 好了 我来倒酒
That's great. Yeah. I'm just gonna refill them.

497
00:30:36,816 --> 00:30:41,003
好了 大家放松一下好好玩吧
Well, everybody relax and enjoy yourselves.

498
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,660
宴会马上就好
Dinner'll be ready soon.

499
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,091
怎么样?
Well?

500
00:30:56,092 --> 00:30:59,240
唾液没血液那么明显 但也有用
Well, saliva isn't as good as blood, but it's working.

501
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:00,266
还有呢?
And?

502
00:31:00,267 --> 00:31:02,232
每个人都恢复凡人状态了 包括佩内洛普
Everybody's coming back mortal, even Penelope.

503
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:03,290
我会继续确认的 
I'll keep checking.  

504
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:04,480
好的 这我就放心了
Well, that's a relief.

505
00:31:06,714 --> 00:31:08,631
温迪 炉子没开火!
Wendy, the oven isn't on!

506
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,244
你可是个女巫诶
You're a witch.

507
00:31:10,423 --> 00:31:12,123
加热
Oh. Calor.

508
00:31:13,842 --> 00:31:15,626
你看过那个画了吗?
Have you checked the painting?

509
00:31:15,721 --> 00:31:18,655
是啊 我为什么不看看画呢?
Why don't I check the painting? Yeah.

510
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:21,457
好吧
Okay.

511
00:31:30,771 --> 00:31:32,312
你来这里干什么?
What are you doing here?

512
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:35,318
我叫他回来的
I asked him to come back.

513
00:31:50,332 --> 00:31:51,950
你在想什么呢 弗雷娅?
What were you thinking, Freya?

514
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,477
我想和我的父亲在一起
I was thinking I wanted to spend time with my father.

515
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,985
维克托 我想你该离开
Victor, I think you should leave.

516
00:31:57,036 --> 00:31:59,006
我觉得弗雷娅的彩排晚宴
I just don't think that Freya's rehearsal dinner 

517
00:31:59,007 --> 00:32:00,976
不是个修补关系的好时间
is the right time to reconnect.

518
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:03,590
拜托? 就像你说的 这是我的彩排晚宴
Hello? Like you said, it's my rehearsal dinner.

519
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,382
要是我想他在这里 他就可以在这里
If I want him to stay, he can stay.

520
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:07,228
我要辩解一下 乔安娜 
In my defense, Joanna, 

521
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:09,409
我今天过来 不是仅仅露个面
I was brought here today. I didn't just show up.

522
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,529
既然我来了 我至少应该和她们说说话
But now that I'm here, I should at least be able to speak to them.

523
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,027
她们也是我的孩子  
They're my children, too.  

524
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:14,524
除非她们不会跟你说话
Not if they don't want to speak to you.

525
00:32:14,525 --> 00:32:17,766
- 我 我想 - 为什么?
- l, I would like to speak to him. - Why?

526
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:20,659
你去哪里了? 我指的不止是这一世
Where have you been? And I don't just mean in this life.

527
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,538
我看过无数过去的照片...一个都没有你
I've seen tons of pictures from the past... you're not in any of them.

528
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:25,699
- 英格丽德 我能解释的 - 对不起
- Ingrid, I can explain. - I'm sorry.

529
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,934
我不想听你的解释
I don't want to hear your explanations.

530
00:32:28,427 --> 00:32:30,897
嘿 各位 只有我和加德纳一家在
Hey, guys. It's getting kind of weird back there 

531
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:31,885
显得有点奇怪呢
with just me and the Gardiners.

532
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:33,716
嘿 你回来了
Oh, hey. You're back.

533
00:32:34,298 --> 00:32:36,735
我要去上菜了
I have to get dinner on the table.

534
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:53,310
我知道你来不是你自己的意思
I know it wasn't your idea to come here.

535
00:32:53,325 --> 00:32:55,960
很抱歉 妈妈和英格丽德那样对你
I'm sorry for the way Mom and Ingrid are being.

536
00:32:55,994 --> 00:32:57,962
没事的 弗雷娅
It's okay, Freya.

537
00:32:57,996 --> 00:32:59,681
她们有她们的原因
They have their reasons.

538
00:32:59,715 --> 00:33:01,832
如果我是她们 也不会想跟我说话了
If I were them, I wouldn't talk to me either.

539
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:06,675
我能... 给你看样东西吗?
Hey. Can I... show you something?

540
00:33:12,811 --> 00:33:16,259
我知道我离开了 但是我... 我有努力
I know I've been gone but I... I do keep up.

541
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,261
尽我所能
As best I can.

542
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:22,203
我不理解
I don't understand.

543
00:33:22,237 --> 00:33:24,038
你离开了我们
You left us.

544
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:28,012
但我离开并不是因为不爱你
Uh... but I didn't leave because I didn't love you.

545
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:31,656
弗雷娅 亲爱的 你要错过晚饭了
Freya, sweetie, you're missing your dinner.

546
00:33:31,657 --> 00:33:34,006
我想... 单独跟你爸爸谈谈
And I'd like to... talk to your father alone.

547
00:33:40,756 --> 00:33:42,178
乔安娜 我没有...  
Look, Joanna, I don't...  

548
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:42,890
不 听我说
No, just listen.

549
00:33:42,925 --> 00:33:46,728
弗雷娅不需要再接近你然后再次被抛弃
Freya does not need to get close to you only to be abandoned again.

550
00:33:46,762 --> 00:33:49,981
我没有抛弃任何人
I did not abandon anyone.

551
00:33:50,015 --> 00:33:52,216
你就是这样跟她们说的吗?
Is that what you told them?

552
00:33:52,234 --> 00:33:54,530
我还能怎么说呢?
Well, what should I have told them?

553
00:33:56,794 --> 00:34:00,640
- 我现在不能这么做 - 乔安娜...
- I can't do this now. - Joanna...

554
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:12,136
宝贝
Babe.

555
00:34:12,755 --> 00:34:14,572
你好吗?
You okay?

556
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:17,575
很好 不好意思 我只是在屋里有点压抑
Yeah. Sorry. It's just a little overwhelming in there.

557
00:34:17,593 --> 00:34:19,427
我想象的到
I can imagine.

558
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:21,929
我只想透透气
I just needed to get outside.

559
00:34:21,964 --> 00:34:24,081
我们去走走吧?
Why don't we go somewhere?

560
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:25,226
什么意思?  
What do you mean? 

561
00:34:25,227 --> 00:34:27,802
好啦 我们走吧 就... 你和我
Come on. Let's go. Just... you and me.

562
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,330
我们一起去冒险吧
Let's start our adventure together.

563
00:34:41,596 --> 00:34:44,952
- 一切都还好吗? - 不 不好
- Is everything okay? - No. Not really.

564
00:34:44,987 --> 00:34:46,621
一点都不好
Not at all.

565
00:34:49,107 --> 00:34:53,205
我知道你爸爸在这儿...
I know your dad being here...

566
00:34:53,627 --> 00:34:56,931
我没心情听那个人的借口
I'm not in the mood for this man's excuses.

567
00:34:57,774 --> 00:34:59,300
你知道吗?
You know?

568
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:01,469
他错过了他的机会
He missed his chance.

569
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:10,247
温迪
Wendy.

570
00:35:10,604 --> 00:35:12,764
我能单独跟英格丽德谈谈吗?
Can I speak to Ingrid alone, please?

571
00:35:17,065 --> 00:35:18,903
英格丽德...
Ingrid...

572
00:35:20,773 --> 00:35:24,492
她不会那么容易原谅你 相信我
Yeah. That one doesn't forgive so easy. Take it from me.

573
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:32,817
在海边的时候 我总会感觉好点
I always feel better when I'm by the ocean.

574
00:35:32,835 --> 00:35:36,454
海那么广阔 让我的问题看起来很渺小
It's so big. It makes my problems feel small.

575
00:35:36,488 --> 00:35:38,456
应该说是我们的问题
Well, now they're our problems.

576
00:35:40,826 --> 00:35:44,178
要是你没办法改变的事呢?
What if it's something you can't fix?

577
00:35:44,213 --> 00:35:46,180
还没有这样的事
No such thing.

578
00:35:46,215 --> 00:35:48,466
- 我是个医生 - 我是认真的
- I'm a doctor. - I'm serious.

579
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,802
我是说 看看我的爸妈
I mean, look at my parents.

580
00:35:50,836 --> 00:35:53,805
他们深爱着彼此 我看的出来
They loved each other. I know they did.

581
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:58,776
但是... 那还不够 他们还是会分开
But... it's not always enough. It can still fall apart.

582
00:35:58,811 --> 00:36:02,113
不论你多么爱一个人 他们还是会离开的
No matter how much you love someone, they can still walk away.

583
00:36:02,147 --> 00:36:05,182
我不会离开你的 永远不会
I won't walk away from you. Ever.

584
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,685
我打赌我爸妈也跟彼此说过这样的话
I bet my parents told each other the same thing.

585
00:36:07,686 --> 00:36:11,323
他们不能在一起不代表我们也一定会分开
Just because it didn't work for them doesn't mean that it won't for us.

586
00:36:11,487 --> 00:36:14,473
这是... 你必须做的选择 
It's... a choice you have to make, 

587
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:16,394
就是你哪儿也不会去
that you're not going anywhere.

588
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:20,464
即使这个选择很难 尤其是确实很难的时候
Even when it gets hard. Especially when it gets hard.

589
00:36:20,499 --> 00:36:23,384
我保证我每天都会做出这样的选择
I promise you I will make that choice every day.

590
00:36:24,703 --> 00:36:27,639
我和你对抗整个世界
It's you and me against the world.

591
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,807
好吗?
Deal?

592
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:31,893
好
Deal.

593
00:36:37,182 --> 00:36:40,217
该把你送回家了
We should probably get you home soon.

594
00:36:40,235 --> 00:36:43,187
对啊 该回去了
Yeah. Probably should.

595
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:53,414
我得说我想念你的聚会了
I got to say I missed your... your parties.

596
00:36:53,448 --> 00:36:56,527
你做的饭 还有...
And your cooking. And, uh...

597
00:36:56,745 --> 00:36:58,569
还有你
And you.

598
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:03,591
乔安娜 无论如何
Joanna, for what it's worth,

599
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:06,427
你都一个人做了一件...
you know, you've done a...

600
00:37:06,461 --> 00:37:08,596
非常棒的事
Pretty great job on your own.

601
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,443
这所有的一切
With everything.

602
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,193
我无法想象你经历了多少困难
I can't imagine how hard it must've been on you.

603
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:17,889
谢谢你
So thank you.

604
00:37:17,923 --> 00:37:21,058
谢谢你照顾好我们的女儿
Thank you for taking such good care of our girls.

605
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:24,929
不客气 谢谢你能这么说 维克托
You're welcome. Thank you for saying that, Victor.

606
00:37:24,947 --> 00:37:28,933
你或许不相信我 但是我仍然想你
You probably don't believe me, but I... I still think about you.

607
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:31,435
每天
Every day.

608
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:36,073
但是你一直知道我在哪儿 我们在哪儿
And yet you've always known where I am. Where all of us are.

609
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:39,212
你知道我从来没有停止过爱你 
You know I never stopped loving you. 

610
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:41,245
那不是我们分开的原因
That wasn't what drove us apart.

611
00:37:46,168 --> 00:37:49,470
我试着用几个轮回的时间来忘记你
I've tried for centuries to forget you.

612
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:51,622
但那没用
It doesn't work.

613
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:56,685
当我见到你 我仍然...
When I see you, I still...

614
00:37:58,925 --> 00:38:00,765
维克托...
Victor...

615
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:15,652
英格丽德
Ingrid.

616
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:20,580
迈克 你怎么找到我的?  
Mike, how did you find me here? 

617
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:22,453
我是个探索者 记得吗?
I'm an explorer, remember?

618
00:38:22,487 --> 00:38:24,505
我查了一下电话簿
I explored a phone book.

619
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:28,175
你不能就这么出现在我家 你有什么事?
You can't just show up at my house. Why are you here?

620
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,921
有件事我需要跟你说
There's something I need to talk to you about.

621
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:34,302
我知道通往仙宫的门在哪儿 
I know where the door to Asgard is. 

622
00:38:34,303 --> 00:38:36,267
我还知道怎么通过那道门
And I know how to get through.

623
00:38:36,301 --> 00:38:38,469
没办法过去的
There's no way through.

624
00:38:38,503 --> 00:38:41,522
只有一把钥匙 但是被毁了
There was only one key, and it was destroyed.

625
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:42,861
那个巨蛇座吗? 
The serpens clavem? 

626
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,309
是的 我还有其他办法 英格丽德
Yeah, I know some things, too, Ingrid.

627
00:38:45,681 --> 00:38:48,379
还有第二把钥匙 这就是我想告诉你的
There's a second key. This is what I've been trying to tell you.

628
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:52,316
- 它在哪儿? - 不是哪儿 而是谁
- Where is it? - Not where. It's who.

629
00:38:53,106 --> 00:38:54,986
是你 英格丽德
It's you, Ingrid.

630
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:58,522
"英德尚格波丽"就是另一把钥匙
"A parching imbued" is the other key.

631
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,993
你就是那把钥匙 你要帮我打开它
You're the other key. And you're gonna help me open it.

632
00:39:12,004 --> 00:39:14,638
这跟我想的一样吗?
Is that what I think it is?

633
00:39:15,232 --> 00:39:16,700
这个镇子唯一的隧道就是
The only tunnels in this town 

634
00:39:16,701 --> 00:39:18,169
费尔黑文下面的地下墓穴
are the catacombs under Fair Haven.

635
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,810
我想不出来还会是什么
I don't know what else it could be.

636
00:39:19,845 --> 00:39:22,234
我以为它是要给我们看假冒者是谁
Well, I thought it was supposed to show us who the shifter is.

637
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,885
本来是的
It was.

638
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:27,143
我不知道这是什么意思 
I don't know what this means.  

639
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:28,719
那我们就要想办法弄明白
Well, we need to figure it out.

640
00:39:28,737 --> 00:39:31,405
弗雷娅明天要在那里结婚
Freya's getting married there tomorrow.

641
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:53,051
我终于要杀了她了 爸爸
I'm finally going to kill her, Father.

642
00:39:54,898 --> 00:39:57,349
然后我就回家
And then I'm coming home.

643
00:40:45,296 --> 00:40:47,648
你来干什么?
What are you doing here?

644
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:49,501
我来跟你说再见
I couldn't leave without saying good-bye.

645
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,326
我爱上你了
I'm in love with you.

646
00:40:57,025 --> 00:40:58,215
- 什么? - 跟我走 
- What? - Come with me. 

647
00:40:58,216 --> 00:40:59,108
我们今晚就可以离开
We can leave tonight.

648
00:40:59,109 --> 00:41:00,817
等等 你不能这么想  
Wait. Y... You need to stop.  

649
00:41:00,818 --> 00:41:02,525
我们属于彼此 你知道的
We belong together. You know we do.

650
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:05,983
这太疯狂了 我明天要跟达什结婚了
This is crazy. I am marrying Dash tomorrow.

651
00:41:06,001 --> 00:41:09,587
你不能嫁给达什 你只会被他占有
You can't marry Dash. You'll just become another one of his possessions.

652
00:41:09,621 --> 00:41:11,488
我们之间是不会变成那样的  
It wouldn't be like that with us. 

653
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:13,090
没有什么"我们" 基利安
There is no "us," Killian.

654
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:14,825
在遇见我之前你梦到我了
You dreamt about me before you met me.

655
00:41:14,843 --> 00:41:16,093
我也梦到你了
I dreamt about you, too.

656
00:41:16,128 --> 00:41:17,898
我都不敢相信你是真实存在的 
I didn't even think you existed 

657
00:41:17,899 --> 00:41:19,532
直到我在订婚晚会上遇见你
until I met you at that engagement party.

658
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:22,133
我的整个人生 我以为我一直在逃避
My whole life, I thought I was running away

659
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,435
所有人 所有事
from everyone, everything.

660
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,770
但是现在我知道...
But now I know I was...

661
00:41:27,016 --> 00:41:29,017
这一切都是为了遇见你
Just running toward you.

662
00:41:31,309 --> 00:41:36,307
我爱你 在遇见你之前就爱上你了
I love you. I loved you even before I met you.

663
00:41:43,304 --> 00:41:45,922
你嫁给他 会毁了你的
You marry him, it'll destroy you.
