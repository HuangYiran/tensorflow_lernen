{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't get it.

105
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought he'd show.

106
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you not to come. They're staking the place out.

107
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- If they find you... - They won't.

108
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,639
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Look at you.

109
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,376
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Letty wouldn't let them junk it.

110
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even though it is a goddamn curse.

111
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,303
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When she came back, she was always in here,

112
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}working on it day and night.

113
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was weird.

114
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was like she knew you were coming back.

115
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to see the crash site.

116
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:46,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just got off the phone with Deputy Director Lawson.

117
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we don't make serious inroads into the Braga case in the next 72 hours,

118
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they're gonna shut us down.

119
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know I'm a newbie here, but why the clock now?

120
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,219
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because it's been two years,

121
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and the last three agents we sent to infiltrate his organization

122
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,266
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}came back in body bags.

123
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's moved more heroin across the border than Escobar did in 1 0 years.

124
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,815
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This guy is becoming one of our biggest national threats,

125
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we don't even have a picture of him.

126
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't have prints! Not even a goddamn DOB!

127
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,826
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's the status on David Park?

128
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lsn't he our ticket into the Braga organization?

129
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're running the name through city and county databases, sorting the possibilities.

130
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,001
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got over 500 already.

131
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Park's insignificant. Sounds like another jerk-off to me.

132
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:37,175
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not. Without Park, Braga wouldn't have drivers to move his shipments.

133
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,011
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cross-check traffic. lllegal modifications.

134
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:44,432
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Street racing. This guy will definitely have a record. We'll find him.

135
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,726
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We better.

136
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,061
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you know?

137
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,815
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your boy Toretto's red Chevelle has been spotted in his old neighborhood.

138
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,692
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to bring his ass in.

139
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not in your car you're not.

140
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,663
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's straight ahead.

141
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You found something back there.

142
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There were burn marks on the ground.

143
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The kind that could only be caused by nitrometh.

144
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,604
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's only one guy in all of L.A. that sells that.

145
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,819
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing you can do is gonna bring her back, Dom.

146
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,199
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I were Letty, I would ask you...

147
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I would beg you, please, let this go.

148
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Before it's too late.

149
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's already too late.

150
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love you.

151
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss Toretto.

152
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,249
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm Michael Stasiak, FBl.

153
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's you and I have a little chat.

154
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,735
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. This is Forsythe in Evidence.

155
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need Stasiak down here right away to sign some greenies.

156
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,032
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks.

157
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,658
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi. Hey.

158
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, I narrowed it down to 50 or so David Parks.

159
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,788
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I'd like you to do is run the make and model on each one of them.

160
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:00,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- All right? - Okay. All right.

161
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

162
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Tyler, we got a transfer.

163
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to come with me?

164
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,997
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Toretto.

165
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,875
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When'd you get back in town?

166
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm looking for a car you did an engine mod on.

167
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:52,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nitromethane tank. Ford full-size. Continental tires.

168
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, what are you doing, coming in here like this, huh?

169
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,891
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This ain't your scene anymore, boss.

170
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,686
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't ever put your hands on me again, okay?

171
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Say hi to your sister for me.

172
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A Korean kid brought it in. David Park.

173
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a green Ford Torino.

174
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,501
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please don't drop this on me!

175
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,091
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm almost done.

176
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you tell me why you dragged me here, Brian?

177
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:49,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know they're going to capture Dom. Maybe worse.

178
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:55,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want you getting tangled up in this. So stay away from him.

179
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,159
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what you have to say to me after five years?

180
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,371
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All of a sudden, you care what happens to me.

181
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I did to you was wrong.

182
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:14,506
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. It was... It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

183
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,885
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, too, Brian.

184
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:23,265
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry that you had to come into my home and pretend to love me.

185
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,726
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry that you ripped my family apart.

186
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,729
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm very sorry that that was hard for you.

187
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,068
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I lied to you.

188
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I lied to Dom. I lied to everybody.

189
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,825
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what I do best. It's why the Feds recruited me.

190
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you're lying to yourself.

191
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:50,834
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you're not the good guy pretending to be a bad guy.

192
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:54,672
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe you're the bad guy pretending to be the good guy.

193
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ever think about that?

194
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,052
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every day.

195
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,274
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always wondered,

196
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}why did you let my brother go that day?

197
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

198
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit.

199
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:37,756
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brian!

200
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,843
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got the cross-checks on David Park back and have a list of possibles.

201
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,387
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What do you got? - All right. A 45-year-old male in a '06 Scion

202
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- with three reckless driving tickets. - No.

203
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,016
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- An '01 Chevy Tahoe. - No.

00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:59,364
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, every corner's got a chingadera tuner racing for pinks.

00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not what Braga has got me looking for.

289
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:08,456
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Braga wants someone that would sell their abuelita to be behind the wheel.

290
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:14,129
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone that drives their 1 0-second cars not in a straight line,

00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:18,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but to push it and make it through places no one else would take it.

292
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,719
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Real drivers.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what are we hauling?

294
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:29,352
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For the money Braga's paying, you don't need to know.

295
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,105
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You just said you wanted real drivers.

296
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A real driver knows exactly what's in his car.

00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,117
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mira, real driver,

299
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You the boss?

300
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,085
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or am I talking to the boss?

301
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,965
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do I look like a boss?

302
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:04,721
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My job is to find the best drivers, period.

303
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,475
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoever wins the race gets the info. We cool?

304

00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,066
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know each other?

409
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,323
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He used to date my sister.

410
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see.

411

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're a lucky man. - How's that?

412
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're still breathing.

413
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:50,843
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To the ladies we've loved and the ladies we've lost.

414
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,604
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what's Braga about?

415
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,399
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, he's just one of us.

416
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:08,945
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Came up from the streets. Down for el barrio.

417
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,238
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now he's a shot caller.

418
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The boss of bosses.

419
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,869
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See all these cats in here?

420
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any one of them would die for Braga.

421
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}lncluding you?

00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enjoy the party, fellows. Club's yours.

424
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever you want, booze, broads, it's all good.

425
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,439
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Braga's mine.

426
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,404
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm taking the whole house down.

427
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,572
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck.

00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something interests you about this car?

429
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,956
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just admiring the body work.

430
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:12,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you one of those boys who prefers cars to women?

431
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:20,719
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm one of those boys that appreciates a fine body, regardless of the make.

432
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your car?

433
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,564
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Fenix's car.

434
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:36,861
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll meet him at the rendezvous. He'll be leading you.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}tell me, what about your women?

438
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It all starts with the eyes.

439
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:58,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's got to have those kind of eyes that can look right through the bullshit

440
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:00,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to the good in someone.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Down to earth.

443
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:17,526
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ain't afraid to get a little engine grease under her fingernails.

444
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:27,119
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That doesn't sound anything like me.

445
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It ain't.

446
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,216
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hi. - Hi.

447
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,385
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I got a gift for you. - All right.

448
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A dirty shot glass, just what I always wanted.

449
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,681
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got these from the club last night.

450
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's two sets of prints here. Run them both.

451
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:53,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know one of these is Campos'. I think the other might be Braga's.

452
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're gonna have to go beyond lnterpol.

453
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, that means I have to contact individual agencies,

454
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:01,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and that could take weeks. Okay.

455
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,086
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

456
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,339
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's your third traffic violation in less than three blocks.

457
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,424
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slow it down, O'Conner.

458
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure thing, Dad.

459
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:54,957
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He stopped.

460
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We lost him.

461
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,598
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He killed the tracker. We don't know that.

462
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,933
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm telling you, he killed the tracker. We don't know that yet!

463
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,935
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the bird overhead.

464
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:01,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right now, I'm moving north, 33', 56'...

465
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All clear.

466
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:31,720

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have a taIIy on the target. Repeat, I don't have a taIIy on the target.

468
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,226
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're gone, there's no one down there.

469
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,644
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn it!

00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:54,493
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This ain't right, bro. Nobody said nothing about being locked in no truck.

474
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,256
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't matter.

475
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:13,011
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're all just along for the ride now.

00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But there are blind spots that I can guide you through via satellite.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're running out of time.

510
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,573
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You need to get out now!

511
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:17,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Base, we're at north 32' 33', west 116' 49'.

512
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:21,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have no visuaI contact. RoII ground units for confirmation.

513
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sloppy!

514
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:45,992
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very sloppy!

515
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,667
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing, man?

516
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,504
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

517
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:01,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out.

518
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, man.

519
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:08,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, today, man. Come on, let's go.

520
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,684
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, don't touch me. Hey, don't touch me, man!

521
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, I said don't touch me, man!

522
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:15,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, look, dawg, don't put your hands on me.

523
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:16,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Malik, chill, bro.

524
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,316
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo, man, what's up with your boy?

525
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,277
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, boss man!

526
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,906
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you say?

527
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:28,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said only pussies run nitrometh.

528
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:33,457
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You looked under my hood?

529
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:42,048
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm talking to you.

530
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:44,342
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got something on your mind?

531
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'70 Plymouth.

532
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:50,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her name was Letty.

533
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yo.

534
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,315
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's my money?

535
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:02,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And somebody wrecked her car.

536
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wrecked her car.

537
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You remember her face?

538
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:23,799
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh?

539
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:26,301
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'Cause I don't.

540
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:30,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Last time I saw it, it was burning.

541
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,529
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now what?

542
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to enjoy what happens next.

543
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,485
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dom, get in!

544
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,446
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get in! Come on!

545
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:34,286
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! Get in the fucking car! Let's go! Hurry up!

546
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:02,898
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have you got, Trinh?

547
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,567
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're contacting agencies in multiple countries.

548
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:10,655
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unfortunately, most of them have to manually scan their prints for us to upload.

549
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,575
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}O'Conner's on line five.

550
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, sir, you should see this.

551
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:17,329
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

552
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:28,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Talk to me, O'Conner.

553
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,468
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where the hell have you been? - I got the shipment.

554
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:34,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"l got the shipment," or "we got the shipment"?

555
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,681
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you taIking about?

556
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:41,227
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Traffic cams in the area picked up pictures of you and Toretto together.

557
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:47,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen to me, O'Conner. Bring in the shipment and bring in Toretto.

558
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:50,195
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I thought the point was to get Braga. We got an opportunity here.

559
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brian, the clock stopped ticking.

560
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:56,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring them in. Are we cIear?

561
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,706
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}O'Conner?

562
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:14,552
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So this is what $60 million looks like.

563
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, we got to get you to a doctor.

564
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:21,685
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got to find a place to hide this.

565
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:25,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a spot.

566
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:38,451
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}502, wet reckless. I need a 48-hour hold.

567
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:42,414
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out back. Any spot you can find.

568
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:49,462
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure about this?

569
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:56,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. The last place they'll check, their own impound yard. Trust me.

570
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:04,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I've been thinking,

571
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:07,522
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too.

572
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:10,108
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah? - Yeah.

573
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So now you owe me a 1 0-second car.

574
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,364
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is that right? - Yeah.

575
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:29,335
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now we're even.

576
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:47,896
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is this your way of keeping me away from him?

577
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:51,858
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're the only one I could call. - He's my brother, of course.

578
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,576
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The bullet's not in there.

579
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:13,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna clean it and stitch it up. It's going to hurt.

580
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,632
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I bet you're going to enjoy this.

581
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,634
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A little.

582
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:23,014
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Want some of this? - Yeah.

583
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's spicy.

584
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like it hot.

585
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dom, what are you doing?

586
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You reached first, you have to say grace.

587
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:49,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Lord, for blessing this table.

588
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:55,255
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With food, family and friendship.

589
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,332
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You asked me why I let Dom go.

590
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:36,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's because at that moment,

591
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:40,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I respected him more than I did myself.

592
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,222
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

593
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:52,937
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One thing I learned from Dom is that nothing really matters unless you have a code.

594
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,443
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And what's your code, Brian?

595
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:02,614
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm working on it.

596
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,025
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit. Hey, Dom.

597
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:41,694
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- When were you gonna tell me? - Dom, what are you doing?

598
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,738
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When were you gonna tell me you were running Letty?

599
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:46,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let me explain... - When were you gonna...

600
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dom, stop!

601
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:55,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You don't understand. - I don't understand?

602
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:56,417
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop!

603
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:01,798
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She did it for...

604
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:06,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dom, stop!

605
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,638
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dom, stop it! Please stop!

606
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:21,693
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She did it for you, Dom! She did it for you!

607
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:30,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Letty came to me to clear your name in exchange for bringing down Braga.

608
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:36,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She just wanted you to come home!

609
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,059
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Dom!

610
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,561
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry!

611
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:27,258
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You better have one hell of an explanation. You disobeyed a direct order.

612
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:30,136
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where's the shipment? - It's safe.

613
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's safe.

614
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:34,974
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, we could use the shipment to parade in front of the media,

615
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:36,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}get a few hundred pounds of heroin off the street,

616
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:40,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but Braga's just gonna send another shipment next week and the week after that.

617
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:42,982
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's use the shipment to lure Braga out

618
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:45,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and lop the head off a multi-billion dollar cartel.

619
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And how do you suggest we do that?

620
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:49,614
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A hand-to-hand exchange with Braga.

621
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:51,074
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll never show.

622
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:52,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He can't afford not to.

623
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:04,754
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got a plan?

624
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:07,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a price.

625
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,596
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We bag Braga, you let Toretto walk.

626
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes? - It's Dom.

627
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:27,944
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was just thinking about you.

628
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:32,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, when I gave you my number, I was hoping you'd call.

629
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:35,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But not under these circumstances.

630
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:38,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What circumstances? Me being alive?

631
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:41,833
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't take it personaIIy.

632
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:44,252
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just business.

633
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:45,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got some business of my own.

634
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:48,673
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get Campos.

635
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:52,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's them.

636
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:57,932
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh-huh.

637
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:02,186
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was that how Braga inspires loyalty? Killing his drivers?

638
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:05,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One can always find more drivers.

639
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,275
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's just good business.

640
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:08,776
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to trade.

641
01:14:09,069 --> 01:14:11,112
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Braga doesn't negotiate.

642
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:12,196
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine.

643
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:17,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You explain to him how all of a sudden $60 million worth of product disappears.

644
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:20,163
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that can't be good for business.

645
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:22,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you want?

646
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:27,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Six million cash, delivered by Braga himself.

647
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:31,841
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't Iike being shot at.

648
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:35,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I ain't gonna put my neck out again unless he's got something to lose, too.

649
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,138
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He'll never go for it.

650
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:40,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Either I deal with Braga, or you do.

651
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:46,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When and where?

652
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:05,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, players are onsite. Holding positions at the perimeter.

653
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:08,419
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Listen up. Everybody stay frosty.

654
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:11,172
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't move a muscIe untiI O'Conner gives the signaI.

655
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:13,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When he gets the money, you know what to do.

656
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:17,011
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, the good news is, when we get this guy,

657
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:19,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you walk out of here a free man.

658
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,307
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that what they told you?

659
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:23,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's the deal.

660
01:15:23,101 --> 01:15:26,521
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You still put milk and cookies out for Santa Claus?

661
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:28,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

662
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:34,862
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here.

663
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:37,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ln case things go shitty.

664
01:15:41,995 --> 01:15:44,038
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just like old times?

665
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:45,414
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

666
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:50,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You dropped something.

667
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's what you wanted, - right? Dom...

668
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:10,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's harmless. Don't worry about him.

669
01:16:12,025 --> 01:16:14,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he's really sorry about Letty.

670
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:18,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's our stuff?

671
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:24,495
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean the stuff that used to be in here, right?

672
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:29,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you'll see it when we see Braga. That was the deal.

673
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,836
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No worries.

674
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:34,213
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Braga keeps his word.

675
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:19,717
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}$2 million.

676
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:23,554
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You get the rest when I get my property.

677
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stasiak. - We got a match.

678
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:31,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fingerprint's Braga's 1 00%.

679
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just waiting on faciaI confirmation via fax.

680
01:17:34,274 --> 01:17:36,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got a question for you.

681
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:40,071
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You wearing pink when you were clawing your way out of el barrio?

682
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Order all agents to move in.

683
01:17:42,866 --> 01:17:45,993
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got confirmation. Primary suspect wearing gray suit.

684
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:47,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's move.

685
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:49,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sir, O'Conner hasn't given us the signal yet.

686
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:52,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What part of that didn't you understand? We just got confirmation. Do it!

687
01:17:52,584 --> 01:17:55,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Secure primary suspect in gray suit. Repeat!

688
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:58,589
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Secure primary suspect in gray suit.

689
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:14,772
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're thinking what I'm thinking, right?

690
01:18:17,567 --> 01:18:19,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He ain't Braga.

691
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:24,782
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit.

692
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:27,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Drop your weapons! FBl!

693
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:28,911
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get down!

694
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of here!

695
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:40,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of here, Dom!

696
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:45,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Run him down.

697
01:18:46,471 --> 01:18:47,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go!

698
01:18:48,348 --> 01:18:50,015
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Campos is Braga!

699
01:18:57,482 --> 01:18:58,774
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on.

700
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,284
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Approaching primary target.

701
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:10,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Primary suspect is secure.

702
01:19:13,665 --> 01:19:15,458
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was under your nose the whoIe time.

703
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:17,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now Braga's escaped.

704
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:20,796
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Toretto's heading south, probably long across the border by now.

705
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:23,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you have any idea the kind of trouble you're in, O'Conner?

706
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,134
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was doing my job.

707
01:19:25,218 --> 01:19:27,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He ain't the first bad guy you helped escape the law's grasp.

708
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As of now, you're being taken off active duty,

709
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}until this house can mount a formal inquiry.

710
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,771
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What about Braga?

711
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:40,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's no longer your concern.

712
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:52,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We now know where Braga is, right?

713
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:55,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Customs tracked him via satellite to his home base in Tecali, Mexico.

714
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:58,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mexico is out of our jurisdiction.

715
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:02,505
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The fact is

716
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:06,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the brass will be so busy holding press conferences over the seizure,

717
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,886
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we'll skate under the radar.

718
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:12,389
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought we signed on to do the right thing.

719
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:52,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone's looking for you.

720
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:54,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm right here.

721
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:57,518
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's nice to see you've gone with the times

722
01:20:57,602 --> 01:21:01,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and switched to electronic fuel injection. Looks good.

723
01:21:02,315 --> 01:21:04,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buster became a gearhead.

724
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:10,281
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going with you.

725
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:16,871
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't plan on bringing anyone back.

726
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

727
01:21:28,925 --> 01:21:30,593
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hit that throttle.

728
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:57,995
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

729
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you say goodbye to your only brother?

730
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,377
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't.

731
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you weren't gonna show up.

732
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:59,366
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You saved my life.

733
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:02,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm willing to return the favor.

734
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:09,084
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This will help get you to Braga.

735
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:14,381
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dom.

736
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:18,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Going in there is suicide.

737
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:28,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have no choice.

738
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,359
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must have loved her very much.

739
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:55,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So this is where my jurisdiction ends.

740
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:03,097
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this is where mine begins.

741
01:25:59,028 --> 01:26:06,076
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- welcome to the house of the lord, Sr.Braga. - Don't worry father, everthing's go.

743
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:30,976
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please receive this blessing.

744
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:15,354
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You ain't forgiven.

745
01:27:18,816 --> 01:27:20,984
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You boys want to arrest me?

746
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:23,946
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...in here.

747
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:26,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, we're beyond that.

748
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:29,952
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't buy your way out of this one.

749
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:32,996
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and me...

750
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:37,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You and me, we're not so different.

751
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:40,379
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're no hero.

752
01:27:51,015 --> 01:27:52,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're right.

753
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:59,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that's why you're going back across the border.

754
01:28:05,154 --> 01:28:06,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But Fenix is mine.

755
01:28:07,865 --> 01:28:08,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You got it.

756
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:32,347
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shit!

757
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:40,939
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll make it a couple of miles out, if you're lucky.

758
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:35,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know where you're going?

759
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:38,955
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want to borrow my GPS?

760
01:29:42,668 --> 01:29:44,378
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are your boys at?

761
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:46,004
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are they going to show up or what?

762
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Careful what you ask for.

763
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:10,028
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just stop. Just stop the car.

764
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:24,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't shoot the boss, idiots.

765
01:30:30,216 --> 01:30:31,925
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right behind you.

766
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:49,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dom, head to the tunnel. Let's use the tunnel.

767
01:31:17,096 --> 01:31:19,055
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of here, Brian.

768
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:30,317
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure you know where the tunnels are? You sure?

769
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,611
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. I'd hold on.

770
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:37,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This might hurt.

771
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:52,923
