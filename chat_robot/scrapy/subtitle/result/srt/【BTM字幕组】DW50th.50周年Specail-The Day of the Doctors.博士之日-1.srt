283
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,550
时间与空间中的每个时刻都在燃烧
Every moment in time and space is burning.

284
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,430
这必须停止
It must end.

285
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,430
我打算用我唯一可行的办法来结束这场战争
And I intend to end it the only way I can.

286
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,902
你要用我来结束这场战争
And you're going to use me

287
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:04,750
用我杀死他们所有人
to end it by killing them all,

288
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,430
所有的Dalek和时间领主一同被毁灭
Daleks and Time Lords alike.

289
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,990
我可以 但你会承担相应的后果
I could, but there will be consequences for you.

290
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
我并无苟且偷生之念
I have no desire to survive this.

291
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,510
那么 那就是对你的惩罚
Then that's your punishment.

292
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,291
如果你这么做 如果你
If you do this - if you

293
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:31,680
杀了他们所有的人 - 那后果就是
kill them all - then that's the consequence.

294
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,280
你  会活下去
You...live.

295
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,350
Gallifrey
Gallifrey...

296
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,270
你会亲手焚毁她
you're going to burn it...

297
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,570
所有的Dalek会与之共焚
and all those Daleks with it

298
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:49,880
但那些孩子也一样
but all those children too.

299
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,720
现在Gallifrey上有多少个孩子
How many children on Gallifrey right now?

300
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,520
我不知道
I don't know.

301
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,880
有一天你会细数的
One day you will count them.

302
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,080
在某个可怕的夜晚
One terrible night.

303
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,520
你想知道那会把你变成什么样的人吗
Do you want to see what that will turn you into?

304
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,560
拜托  你难道不好奇吗
Come on! Aren't you curious?

305
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,600
我开了一扇通向你未来的窗口
I'm opening windows on your future.

306
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,550
通往未来之日的时间结
A tangle in time through the days to come,

307
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,480
通向今时今日所成就的那个你
to the man today will make of you.

308
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,240
好吧 我可没料到这个
OK, I wasn't expecting that.

309
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,510
但时间大战已经结束了
But the Time War's over.

310
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,670
为什么你把我们带到这儿来看这幅画
Why have you brought us here to look at a painting?

311
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,310
这幅画仅仅是伊丽莎白的信任状
The painting only serves as Elizabeth's credentials,

312
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,670
用来证明那封信是她的亲笔
proof that the letter is from her.

313
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,160
这不是你们来这儿的原因
It's not why you're here.

314
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,742
我最爱的你
My dearest love,

315
00:18:00,743 --> 00:18:03,590
我希望这幅名为"Gallifrey陷落"的油画
I hope the painting known as Gallifrey Falls

316
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,213
能向你证明
will serve as proof that

317
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:07,990
现在在写信给你的是你的伊丽莎白
it is your Elizabeth who writes to you now.

318
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,110
你该记得
You will recall that you pledged yourself

319
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,910
你发过誓要保卫我的王国
to the safety of my kingdom.

320
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,470
于是 我以女王之名任命你为
In this capacity, I have appointed you as curator

321
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,087
地下美术馆的馆长
of the Under Gallery where

322
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:18,470
那里锁着全英国最致命的隐患
deadly danger to England is locked away.

323
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,310
那几堵墙内若有任何风吹草动
Should any disturbance occur within its walls,

324
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,403
召你至此就是我最大的心愿
it is my wish that you be summoned.

325
00:18:23,404 --> 00:18:25,040
一路平安 我温柔的夫君
God speed, gentle husband.'

326
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,310
发生了什么
What happened?

327
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,960
直接带你去看吧
Easier to show you.

328
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,320
我是McGillop
McGillop.

329
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,910
但那不可能 我刚还在...
But that's not possible. I was just...

330
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,440
明白 长官 但...
Understood, sir. But...

331
00:18:56,441 --> 00:18:58,960
为什么我要把它带去那里
why would I take it there?

332
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,960
伊丽莎白一世  你认识她咯
Elizabeth the First? You knew her, then?

333
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,320
很久以前的事了
A long time ago.

334
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:30,465
{\a6}英格兰 1562年

335
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,590
我们走
Allons-y!

336
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,750
这下你相信了吧 女王陛下 我跟你说了什么
There you go, Your Majesty, what did I tell you?

337
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,510
里面比外面大
Bigger on the inside!

338
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,950
门可不够大  你险些把我的头给削下来
The door isn't - you nearly took my head off.

339
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,470
一般来说我才是干这事的人
It's normally me who does that.

340
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,448
告诉我 博士 为什么我要
Tell me, Doctor, why I'm

341
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:51,470
在你身上浪费时间 我还要策划战争呢
wasting my time on you. I have wars to plan.

342
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,830
因为你要跟我野餐啊
You have a picnic to eat.

343
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,870
你可以来帮我
You could help me.

344
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,350
呃
Well...

345
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,040
我在帮你吃野餐
I'm helping you eat the picnic.

346
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,920
但是你对战争也有好胃口
But you have a stomach for war.

347
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,150
这张脸目睹过战斗
This face has seen conflict -

348
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,950
一目了然
it's clear as day.

349
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,480
哦 我目睹过你无法置信的战争
Oh, I've seen conflict like you wouldn't believe.

350
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,360
但不是这张脸
But it wasn't this face.

351
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,312
但别纠结那个了 女王陛下
But never mind that, Your Majesty -

352
00:20:17,313 --> 00:20:18,470
站起来  起来  起来
up on your feet! Up, up!

353
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,510
你大胆包天
How dare you?!

354
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,030
我可是英国女王
I'm the Queen of England!

355
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,630
我可不是英国人
I'm not English.

356
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,470
伊丽莎白
Elizabeth,

357
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,150
你愿意嫁给我吗
will you marry me?

358
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,070
哦 天呐 亲爱的  我当然愿意
Oh, my dear, sweet love. Of course I will!

359
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,790
- 啊  被我识破啦   - 亲爱的
- Ah! Gotcha!   - My love?

360
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,913
首先  真正的伊丽莎白
One! The real Elizabeth

361
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:34,190
绝不会答应我的求婚
would never have accepted my marriage proposal.

362
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,350
其次 真正的伊丽莎白会注意到
Two! The real Elizabeth would notice

363
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,830
我刚才随口提到了我有另外一张脸
when I just casually mention having a different face.

364
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,710
不过 真正的伊丽莎白
But then the real Elizabeth

365
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,430
也不是一个外太空来的变形外星人
isn't an alien shape-shifting from outer space!

366
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,630
而且
And...

367
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,230
叮
..Ding.

368
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,590
那是什么
What's that?

369
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,590
那是一个会..."叮"的机器
It's a machine that goes...ding!

370
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,110
我自己做的
Made it myself.

371
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,910
它探测到变形者的DNA就会闪一下  噢
It lights up in the presence of shape-shifter DNA. Ooh.

372
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,990
而且它可以微波加热20英尺之内的冷冻晚餐
Also it can microwave frozen dinners from up to 20 feet

373
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,430
也可以从未来下载漫画书
and download comics from the future.

374
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,734
我总不懂得何时停下
I never know when to stop.

375
00:20:59,735 --> 00:21:00,830
亲爱的 我不明白
My love, I do not understand.

376
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,920
我不是你的亲爱的  而且 你心里明白得很
I'm not your love. And yes, you do!

377
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,350
你是一个Zygon
You're a Zygon.

378
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,630
一个Zygon
A Zygon?

379
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,150
哦 得了吧 别装了  一个Zygon 是的
Oh, stop it, it's over! A Zygon, yes.

380
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,310
一个巨大的红色橡胶怪 全身长满吸盘
A big red rubbery thing, covered in suckers.

381
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,790
但吻技出人意料得高超
Surprisingly good kisser.

382
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,750
想想也不可能 真正的英国女王会
Think the real Queen of England would just decide

383
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,701
决定跟一个长相帅气
to share the throne with

384
00:21:16,702 --> 00:21:18,310
穿着紧身西装的家伙分享王权
any old handsome bloke in a tight suit...

385
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,150
就只是因为他有帅气惊人的发型
Just cos he's got amazing hair

386
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,400
和一匹好马吗
and a nice horse?

387
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,350
噢
Oh.

388
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,830
是那匹马
It was the horse!

389
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,390
我要当国王了
I'm going to be King!

390
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,225
跑   - 发生了什么
Run!   - What's happening?

391
00:21:31,226 --> 00:21:31,910
我们在被
We're being attacked

392
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,630
一个外太空的变形外星人袭击
by a shape-shifting alien from outer space,

393
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,016
它之前还变成了我的马
formerly disguised as my horse.

394
00:21:35,017 --> 00:21:35,750
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

395
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,720
就是说... 我们需要一匹新马了
It means... we're going to need a new horse.

396
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,910
它要去哪里
Where's it going?

397
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,190
我去拖住它 你快跑  你的人民需要你
I'll hold it off, you run. Your people need you.

398
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,640
我要你活着跟我步入婚姻殿堂
And I need you alive for our wedding day.

399
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,350
哦 干得好 博士 真不错
Oh, good work, Doctor, nice one!

400
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,520
童贞女王吗  历史有点吃不消啊
The Virgin Queen? So much for history!

401
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,670
加把力
Come on!

402
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,990
我知道你在那里
Know you're there!

403
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,190
哇 哇 哇 哇
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

404
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,590
哦 很聪明
Oh, very clever.

405
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,510
无论你在策划什么 放弃吧
Whatever you've got planned, forget it.

406
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,030
我是博士
I'm the Doctor.

407
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,030
我已经904岁了
I'm 904 years old.

408
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,958
我来自于Kasterborous星系
I'm from the planet

409
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:31,230
的Gallifrey星
Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous.

410
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,670
我是预至的风暴 我是黑暗的使者
I am the Oncoming Storm, the bringer of darkness,

411
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,000
而你 基本上就只是只兔子 是吧
and you are basically just a rabbit, aren't you?

412
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,390
好吧 继续  只是  一个 常规的
OK, carry on - just a...general...

413
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,870
警告
warning.

414
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,350
伊丽莎白
Elizabeth!

415
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,110
那个东西  你跟我解释清楚
That thing...explain what it is!

416
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,710
它想从我们这得到什么
What does it want of us?

417
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,310
那也是我想弄明白的 可能只是你的星球吧
That's what I'm trying to find out. Probably just your planet.

418
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,270
离开她 博士 那不是我 那是那个东西
Step away from her, Doctor. That's not me, that's the creature.

419
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,230
那怎么可能 她是我
How is that possible? She's me.

420
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,910
博士 她竟然是我
Doctor, she's me!

421
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,045
我 的确 是我
I am, indeed, me.

422
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:14,830
你可永远得不到这句赞扬呢
A compliment that cannot be extended to yourself.

423
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,190
太神奇了
Extraordinary!

424
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,750
那个东西竟然和我一模一样
The creature has captured my exact likeness -

425
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,550
这太了不起了
this is exceptional.

426
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,270
了不起?  一位女王会说这是犯上无礼
Exceptional? A Queen would call it impertinent.

427
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,310
一位女王会情不自禁地想要
A Queen would feel compelled to admire

428
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,590
欣赏处决的技术
the skill of the execution -

429
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,430
之后她就要下令了
before arranging one.

430
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,950
啊  它坏掉了
Ah! It's not working!

431
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,070
可以推断这怪物会很快学会
One might surmise the creature would learn quickly

432
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,070
保护自己 不会被简简单单地探测出来
to protect itself from any simple means of detection.

433
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,030
很明显你比我更了解这怪物
Clearly you understand the creature better than I.

434
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,950
不过你本就有优势
But then you have the advantage.

435
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,670
退后 你们俩都退后 快
Back, both of you, now!

436
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,710
那是时间裂隙 现实结构中的裂口
That's a time fissure, a tear in the fabric of reality.

437
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,160
什么都有可能发生
Anything could happen!

438
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,390
比如
For instance...

439
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,160
一顶土耳其毡帽
a fez.

440
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,200
这边走
This way.

441
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,400
欢迎来到地下美术馆
Welcome to the Under Gallery.

442
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,310
伊丽莎白一世在这里存放所有
This is where Elizabeth the First kept all art

443
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,600
太危险而不适于向公众展示的艺术品
deemed too dangerous for public consumption.

444
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,270
岩粉
Stone dust.

445
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,550
那重要吗
Is it important?

446
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,990
1200年来 我从未踩在不重要的东西上面
In 1,200 years, I've never stepped in anything that wasn't.

447
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,910
喂 你  你搞科学么
Oi, you! Are you sciencey?

448
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,270
噢 呃  那个 是的
Oh, erm. Well, erm...yes.

449
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,190
- 你有名字吗   - 是的
Got a name? Yes.

450
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,350
太好了 我一直想碰见个名叫"是的"的人
Good, I've always wanted to meet someone called Yes.

451
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,590
好 分析这些岩粉
Now, I want this stone dust analysed.

452
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,390
给我一式三份的报告
And I want a report in triplicate,

453
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,550
里面要有好多图表 示意图和复杂的数字计算
with lots of graphs and diagrams and complicated sums,

454
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,350
明天一早 送到我桌上 尽快 立刻 哈哈哈
on my desk, tomorrow morning, ASAP, pronto, LOL.

455
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,750
看到没  我有工作
See? Job.

456
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,961
我有办公桌吗
Do I have a desk?

457
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:57,710
- 没有   - 我还想要张桌子
- No.   - And I want a desk!

458
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,120
去组织一个小组 分析这些岩粉
Get a team, analyse the stone dust.

459
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,360
快用吸入器
Inhaler!

460
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,270
总有一天 你能对土耳其毡帽视而不见吧
Someday, you could just walk past a fez.

461
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,000
永远不可能
Never going to happen.

462
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,760
按您的指示 没有碰任何东西
As you instructed, nothing has been touched.

463
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,480
这是我们叫你来的原因
This is why we called you in.

464
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,030
又是3D的
3D again.

465
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,190
- 有意思   - 你说碎掉的玻璃吗
- Interesting.   - The broken glass?

466
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,390
不
No...

467
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
是玻璃打碎的方向
where it's broken from.

468
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,310
看看它破碎的图案
Look at the shatter pattern.

469
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,056
所有画上的玻璃
The glass on all these paintings

470
00:25:52,057 --> 00:25:54,040
都是从里面打破的
has been broken from the inside.

471
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,110
如你所见 所有的画都是风景
As you can see, all the paintings are landscapes -

472
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,270
- 没有任何人物   - 那又如何
- no figures of any kind. - So?

473
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,600
曾经有的
There used to be.

474
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,055
有东西从画里出来了吗
Something's got out of the paintings?

475
00:26:11,056 --> 00:26:11,990
很多东西
Lots of somethings.

476
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,830
危险的东西
Dangerous.

477
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,670
这整个地方都被搜查过了
This whole place has been searched.

478
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,203
没有发现不属于这儿的异物
There's nothing here that shouldn't be,

479
00:26:17,204 --> 00:26:18,600
也没有东西从这儿出去
and nothing's got out.

480
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,230
哦 不  别是现在
Oh, no! Not now!

481
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,403
博士 那是什么
Doctor, what is it?

482
00:26:23,404 --> 00:26:24,470
别是现在 我忙着呢
No, not now. I'm busy!

483
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,230
它和画有关吗
Is it to do with the paintings?

484
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,430
不 不 这是别的  我记得这个
No, no. This is different. I remember this.

485
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,280
差不多记得
Almost remember...

486
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,920
噢 当然了
Oh, of course!

487
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,160
是轮到我上场的时候了
This is where I come in.

488
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,630
走咯
Geronimo-o...

489
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,670
博士  等等
Doctor! Wait.

490
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,190
这个男人是谁
Who is this man?

491
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,790
我也在想这个问题
That's just what I was wondering.

492
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,670
噢 那真瘦
Oh, that is skinny.

493
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,550
真是骨感啊
That is proper skinny.

494
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,470
我从来没从外面看过
I've never seen it from the outside.

495
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,520
像特效一样  喂  哈  瘦火柴棍
It's like a special effect. Oi! Ha! Matchstick man!

496
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,760
你不是
You're not...

497
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,845
为了补偿吧   - 补偿什么
Compensating? - For what?

498
00:27:31,846 --> 00:27:33,190
重生效果 碰运气的事儿
Regeneration, it's a lottery.

499
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,470
噢 他很酷 不是吗
Oh, he's cool. Isn't he cool?

500
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,024
"我是博士 我很酷
"I'm the Doctor and I'm all cool -

501
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:38,710
哎呀呀 我穿着沙滩鞋呢"
oops, I'm wearing sandshoes!"

502
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,230
你在这干什么 我忙着呢
What are you doing here? I'm busy.

503
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,830
噢 忙吗  我知道了 这就叫忙着 对吗
Oh, busy? I see, is that what we're calling it, eh? Eh?

504
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,929
你们好啊 女士们   - 少来
Hello, ladies. - Don't start.

505
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,870
你在这一任重生
Listen, what you get up to

506
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,430
的私人时间里干了些什么不关我的事儿
in the privacy of your own regeneration is your business.

507
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,590
他们里有一个Zygon
One of them is a Zygon.

508
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,630
恶
Urgh...

509
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,870
我可没在评判你
I'm not judging you.

510
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,350
哦 太可爱了
Oh, lovely!

511
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,550
陛下们... 或许你们该跑了
Your Majesties...probably a good time to run.

512
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,310
- 但那怪物怎么办   - 伊丽莎白
- But what about the creature? - Elizabeth, whichever one of you

513
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,247
不论你们中哪个是真的
is the real one, turn and

514
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:09,990
向另一个跑的反方向跑
run in the opposite direction to the other one.

515
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,150
好的 吾爱
Of course, my love!

516
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,190
要活着 吾爱
Stay alive, my love.

517
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,760
我们还没有结束
I am not done with you yet.

518
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,590
谢谢 很好
Thanks. Lovely.

519
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,110
我理解 为我活下去 亲爱的
I understand. Live for me, my darling.

520
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,360
我们会重聚的
We shall be together again.

521
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,840
那个 这样也挺好吧?
Well, won't that be nice?

522
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,390
- 其中一个是Zygon   - 没错

- Yeah, I'm getting the point, thanks. - Nice.

527
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,129
博士 是你吗

528
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,150
啊 你好 Clara  你能听到吗

Yeah, it's me, we can hear you. Where are you?

530
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,390
- 我们在哪   - 英国 1562年
- Where are we? - England...1562.

531
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,710
你在和谁说话
Who are you talking to?

532
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,750
我自己
Myself.

533
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,310
你能回来吗
Can you come back through?

534
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,710
实体通道不一定是双向的
Physical passage may not be possible in both directions.

535
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,830
是... 对了
It's... Ah!

536
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,640
等等 毡帽来了
Hang on! Fez incoming!

537
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,360
什么都没有
Nothing here.

538
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,720
那它去哪了
So where did it go?

539
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,120
- 他在和谁说话   - 他刚说了 他自己
- Who's he talking to?  - He said. Himself.

540
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,772
继续和他说话  Malcolm吗
Keep him talking. Malcolm?

541
00:29:20,773 --> 00:29:21,710
我需要你给我拿
Malcolm, I need you to send me

542
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,350
我父亲的一份事件档案  代码是Cromer
one of my father's incident files - codenamed Cromer.

543
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,910

'70s or '80s, depending on the dating protocol.

544
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,975
好了 你曾经是我
OK, you used to be me,

545
00:29:31,976 --> 00:29:34,190
你都做过这些了 接下来会怎样
you've done all this before - what happens next?

546
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,150
我不记得了
I don't remember.

547
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,070
你怎么能忘了这个
How can you forget this?!

548
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,110
等等 又不是我的错
Hey, hang on, it's not MY fault.

549
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,259
很明显是你
You're obviously not

550
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,880
注意力不集中 快把极性倒转
paying enough attention. Reverse the polarity!

551
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,910
- 没用啊   - 我们都在倒转极性
- It's not working. - We're both reversing the polarity!

552
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,978
是啊 我知道
Yes, I know that.

553
00:29:52,979 --> 00:29:54,230
有两个人 我在倒转极性
There's two of us - I'm reversing it,

554
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,200
你又把它倒转回来 我们让极性混乱了
and you're reversing it back again! We're confusing the polarity.

555
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,430
有谁把毡帽弄丢了吗
Anyone lose a fez?

556
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,190
是你
You.

557
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,870
你怎么会在这
How can you be here?

558
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,030
更重要的是 你为什么来这
More to the point, WHY are you here?

559
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,950
下午好
Good afternoon.

560
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,800
我...在找博士
I'm...looking for the Doctor.

561
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,390
这个嘛 你还真来对地方了
Well...you've certainly come to the right place.

562
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,950
很好  不错
Good! Right!

563
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,750
你们是什么人
Well, who are you boys?

564
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,430
噢 当然了  你们是他的同伴吗
Oh, of course! Are you his companions?

565
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,030
他的同伴
His companions?

566
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,110
博士的同伴越来越年轻了
They get younger all the time!

567
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,320
那个 你能不能给我
Well, if you could point

568
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:31,520
大致指一下博士在哪
me in the general direction of the Doctor...

569
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,550
真的吗
Really?

570
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,830
是的
Yeah.

571
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,870
- 是真的   - 你们是我? 两个都是?
- Really.   - You're me? Both of you?

572
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,230
- 是的   - 那个也是?
Yep. Even that one?

573
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,030
对
Yes!

574
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,790
你们是我将来的自己
You're my future selves.

575
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,070
对
Yes!

576
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,550
我中年危机了吗
Am I having a mid-life crisis?

577
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,670
你们干嘛那样拿螺丝起子指着
Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like that?

578
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,390
那是科学仪器 又不是水枪
They're scientific instruments, not water pistols.

579
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,120
你们活像见鬼了似的
Look like you've seen a ghost!

580
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,904
不过 我挺喜欢这幅行头
Still...loving the posh,

581
00:31:07,905 --> 00:31:09,750
又时髦又沧桑  很让人信服
gravelly thing. It's very convincing.

582
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,470
说得好 Dick Van Dyke
Brave words, Dick Van Dyke.

583
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,470
{\a6}Dick Van Dyke 著名演员 作品有<博物馆奇妙夜>等

584
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,910
包围他们
Encircle them!

585
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,800
你们谁是博士
Which of you is the Doctor?

586
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,607
英格兰女王被施了魔咒
The Queen of England is bewitched.

587
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:20,110
我要拿下博士的项上人头
I would have the Doctor's head.

588
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,720
你今天真是走运啦
Well, this has all the makings of your lucky day.

589
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,670
我觉得现在有三个博士了
I think there's three of them now.

590
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,630
这事有过先例
There's a precedent for that.

591
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,160
那是什么
What is that?

592
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,590
哦 又开始指指戳戳了 那是螺丝起子
Oh, the pointing again. They're screwdrivers!

593
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,990
你们能干什么 用他们组装个柜子吗
What are you going to do, assemble a cabinet at them

594
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,670
那玩意  那是什么巫术
That thing...what witchcraft is it?

595
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,150
啊 没错
Ah, yes!

596
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,750
既然你提到了 这就是巫术 对对对
Now that you mention it, that is witchcraft, yes, yes, yes.

597
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,285
很坏很坏的巫术  喂
Witchy-witchcraft. Hello?

598
00:31:48,286 --> 00:31:50,390
有人吗  有人吗 喂
Hello in there? Excuse me. Hello!

599
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,110
我是在与井中的邪恶女巫对话吗
Am I talking to the wicked witch of the well?

600
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,950
他指的是你
He means you.

601
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,790
为什么我是女巫
Why am I the witch?

602
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,030
- Clara   - 你好
- Clara? - Hello?

603
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,430
Clara 嗨 你好
Clara, hi, hello.

604
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,510
你能不能让这些啰嗦的凡人
Hello. Would you mind telling these prattling mortals

605
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,030
自觉走开呢
to get themselves begone?

606
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,830
如  如他所言
What...he said.

607
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,070
好吧 再润色润色嘛
Yes, tiny bit more colour.

608
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,470
好吧
Right.

609
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,030
啰嗦的凡人 尔等走开
Prattling mortals, off you pop,

610
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,270
不然我把你们都变成青蛙
or I'll turn you all into frogs.

611
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,190
哦 青蛙呀 不错 你们都听到了
Oh, frogs, nice. You heard her.

612
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,150
博士 发生什么了
Doctor, what's going on?

613
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,630
这是 时间乱乱了
It's a...timey-wimey thing.

614
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,230
时间 怎么了  时间乱乱
Timey...what? Timey-wimey?

615
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,750
我可不知道他从哪学会的这句话
I've no idea where he picks that stuff up.

616
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,270
女王
The Queen!

617
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,130
你们似乎没有下跪呀
You don't seem to be kneeling.

618
00:32:34,131 --> 00:32:35,270
多么大胆
How tremendously brave of you.

619
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,581
你是哪一个
Which one are you?

620
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:38,750
- 另一个怎么了   - 偶感不适
- What happened to the other one?   - Indisposed.

621
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,710
- 女王万岁   - 女王万岁
- Long live the Queen! - Long live the Queen!

622
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,070
逮捕他们 押送至塔楼
Arrest these men. Take them to the Tower.

623
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,670
那不是英格兰女王  那是个外星复制品
That is not the Queen of England - that's an alien duplicate!

624
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,888
你们得相信他
And you can take it from him,

625
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:49,430
- 他真的检查过了   - 哦 闭嘴吧
- cos he's really checked.   - Oh, shut up!

626
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,430
- 舌头上有毒囊   - 拜托你 闭嘴吧
- Venom sacs in the tongue.   - Seriously, stop it!

627
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,270
不 等等 塔楼 你说塔楼吗
No, hang on, the Tower! Did you say the Tower?

628
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,910
啊 绝妙 爱死那座塔了 请八点送早饭
Ah, yes, brilliant, love the Tower. Breakfast at eight, please.

629
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,950
那有Wi-Fi吗
Will there Wi-Fi?

630
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,110
你说话时能不手舞足蹈吗
Are you capable of speaking without flapping your hands about?

631
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,430
可以  看来不行
Yes! No!

632
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,830
我要求立刻被监禁在塔中
I demand to be incarcerated in the Tower immediately

633
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,888
与我的合谋者一起
with my co-conspirators,

634
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:07,510
- 沙滩鞋小子和老爷爷   - 老爷爷
- Sandshoes and Grandad! - Grandad?

635
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,870
- 这不是沙滩鞋   - 这就是
- They're not sandshoes. - Yes, they are!

636
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,430
安静  塔楼不容轻视
Silence! The tower is not to be taken lightly.

637
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,190
很少有人重见天日
Very few emerge again.

638
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,287
天啊 那人好聪明 来吧
Dear God, that man's clever. Come on!

639
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,070
我们去哪
Where are we going?

640
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,040
我的办公室  大家也叫它伦敦塔
My office. Otherwise known as the Tower of London.

641
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,440
喂 你们几个 滚进去
Oi, you lot, get in there!

642
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,200
啊
Ow!

643
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,510
我们三人在一个囚室里
Three of us in one cell -

644
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,633
如果不赶紧出去
that's going to cause some

645
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:38,390
肯定会引发一些严重的异象
nasty anomalies if we don't get out soon.

646
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,680
你在做什么
What are you doing?

647
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,654
- 把我们弄出去   - 音速起子
- Getting us out! - The sonic

648
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:46,430
对那门没用 太原始了
won't work on that - it's too primitive.

649
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,990
我们应该要求提高牢门质量让我们好逃跑吗
Shall we ask for a better quality of door so we can escape?

650
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,910
好吧 现在英格兰女王是个Zygon
OK, so the Queen of England is now a Zygon,

651
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,790
不过别管那个 我们为什么聚在了一起
but never mind that, why are we all together?

652
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,480
我们为什么都在这
Why are we all here?

653
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,710
我和...下巴君 我们都很意外
Well, me and...Chinny, we were surprised.

654
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,310
但你是来找我们
But you came looking for us -

655
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,150
你知道这会发生  谁告诉你的
you knew it was going to happen. Who told you?

656
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,510
喂 "下巴君"什么意思
Oi! "Chinny"?

657
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,440
没错 你下巴的确出众
Yeah, you do have a chin.

658
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,070
大理石 花岗岩... 许多不同的岩石
Marble, granite... A lot of different stone,

659
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,190
但都不是来自那座建筑体的
but none of it from the fabric of the building.

660
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,190
就好像有人砸碎了许多古老的雕塑
It's like somebody smashed up a lot of old statues.

661
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,590
有失踪的雕像吗
Are there any missing?

662
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,110
我觉得没有
Don't think so.

663
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,040
怎么会有人那么做
Why would anyone do that anyway?

664
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,870
我是说 我知道我们应该思想开放
I mean, I know we're meant to keep an open mind,

665
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,230
但我们真要相信
but are we supposed to believe in creatures

666
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,950
有生物能藏在油画里
that can hide in oil paintings

667
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,920
并对雕塑心怀怨恨吗
and have some sort of a grudge against statues?

668
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,400
你还好吗
You all right?

669
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,817
我们必须离开 现在 此刻
We have to go - right now, this minute.

670
00:34:44,818 --> 00:34:45,470
怎么了
What's wrong?

671
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,790
那些油画里的东西
The things from the paintings...

672
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,960
我知道他们为什么要砸碎雕像了
I know why they smashed the statues.

673
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,800
- 为什么   - 因为他们需要藏身之地
- Why? - Because they needed somewhere to hide.

674
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,790
博士会来救我的 博士会来救我的
The Doctor will save me, the Doctor will save me,

675
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,430
博士会来救我的 博士会来救我的
the Doctor will save me, the Doctor will save me,

676
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,390
博士会来救我的 博士会来救我的
the Doctor will save me, the Doctor will save me...

677
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,880
抱歉  我需要我的吸入器
Excuse me - I'm going to need my inhaler.

678
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,990
我复制了一个有缺陷的 真讨厌
I so hate it when I get one with a defect!

679
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,470
噢 你心里可有一些绝佳的可怕回忆
Oh, you've got some perfectly horrible memories in here,

680
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,560
不是么
haven't you?

681
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,550
那么嫉妒你那个可爱的妹妹
So jealous of your pretty sister.

682
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,680
我不怪你 我也希望我复制的是她
I don't blame you, I wish I'd copied HER.

683
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,720
我也希望
So do I!

684
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,840
噢 看在上帝的份儿上
Oh, for goodness' sake...!

685
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,350
博士会试着给我们留消息
The Doctor will be trying to send us a message.

686
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,070
我们要寻找一串大约留于
We're looking for a string of numerals

687
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,230
1550年的字符  最高优先级
from around 1550, approximately - priority one.

688
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,080
我需要进入黑色档案馆
I'm going to need access to the Black Archive.

689
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,310
黑色档案馆
The Black Archive.

690
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,670
地球上安全等级最高的地方
Highest security rating on the planet.

691
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,946
全体员工在一次轮班结束时
The entire staff have their

692
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,870
都会被抹去记忆
memories wiped at the end of every shift.

693
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,710
自动记忆过滤器就装在天花板上
Automated memory filters in the ceiling.

694
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,040
- 请让我进入   - 是 夫人
- Access, please.  - Ma'am.

695
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,470
你是Atkins 对吗
Atkins, isn't it?

696
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,470
是的 夫人  第一天当班
Yes, ma'am. First day here.

697
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,958
他已经工作十年了
Been here ten years

698
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,350
锁与钥匙  有点原始 不是么
Lock and key - bit basic, isn't it?

699
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,430
我们可不敢把电子安保系统装在这里
Can't afford electronic security down here -

700
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,750
得防着博士进来
got to keep the Doctor out.

701
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,350
整座塔都是防Tardis入侵的
The whole of the Tower is TARDIS-proofed.

702
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,248
他可不会喜欢这里的藏品
He really wouldn't approve of the collection.

703
00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:57,310
可你让我进来了
But you let me in?

704
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,350
你的上一次访问给了你最高安全等级
You have a top-level security rating from your last visit.

705
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,270
抱歉 我的啥
Sorry, my what?

706
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,030
抱歉  我们必须筛查所有已知的博士联系人
Apologies. We have to screen all of his known associates -

707
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,830
我们不能让博士与TARDIS
we can't have information about the Doctor and the TARDIS

708
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,510
被不恰当的人掌控
falling into the wrong hands.

709
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,280
会有灾难性的后果
The consequences could be disastrous.

710
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,200
那是什么
What is that?

711
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,630
时间旅行
Time travel.

712
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,670
漩涡操纵器  Jack Harkness上校
A vortex manipulator, bequeathed to the UNIT archive

713
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,390
去世时捐赠给UNIT的
by Captain Jack Harkness, on the occasion of his death.

714
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,150
他的某一次去世时
Well, one of them.

715
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,868
不能让任何人知道我们有这个
No-one can know we have this,

716
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:29,790
- 甚至我们的同盟也不行   - 为什么
- not even our allies.  - Why not?

717
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,150
想想吧
Think about it!

718
00:37:31,151 --> 00:37:34,390
拥有改写历史能力的美国人
Americans with the ability to rewrite history?

719
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,080
你也看过他们的电影了
You've seen their movies.

720
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,510
好吧 所以我们就要这么去营救博士
OK, so this is how we're going to rescue the Doctor.

721
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,830
我不确定它的能量是否足够往返
I'm not sure there's enough power for a two-way trip.

722
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,230
无论如何 我们不知道激活码
In any event, we don't know the activation code.

723
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,590
博士知道我们有这东西
The Doctor knows we have this,

724
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,390
所以他总不把激活码告诉我们
so he's always kept the code from us.

725
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,990
但愿他改变主意了
Let's hope he changes his mind.

726
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,950
是我
Yes.

727
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,670
如果你找到了
Well, if you've found it,

728
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,920
就赶紧拍下来 发到我手机上
photograph it and send it to my phone.

729
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,270
呃 Kate  他们该在这儿吗
Erm, Kate. Should they be here?

730
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,750
他们为什么跟着我们
Why have they followed us?

731
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,227
噢 他们大概只是
Oh, they've probably just

732
00:38:14,228 --> 00:38:16,870
太早处理完人类了
finished disposing of the humans a bit early.

733
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,030
人类?
The humans...?

734
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,840
天啊  我太入戏了不是吗
Dear me! I really do get into character, don't I?

735
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,150
地下美术馆已经被我们掌握
The Under Gallery is secured.

736
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,438
准备再处理一个人类吧
Prepare to dispose of one more human.

737
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:48,920
我们已经取得了设备
We have acquired the device.

738
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,640
激活码  对吧
Activation code - right?

739
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,595
理论上来说 我可以
In theory, I can

740
00:38:58,596 --> 00:39:00,670
触发分子间的独立声波位移
trigger an isolated sonic shift

741
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,990
这门也就分崩离析了
among the molecules, and the door should disintegrate.

742
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,270
我们得计算出整个结构的具体共振频率
We'd have to calculate the exact harmonic resonance

743
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,470
要精确到亚原子级别
of the entire structure down to a sub-atomic level.

744
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,830
就算用音速起子也需要好多年
Even the sonic would take years.

745
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,150
不 不  用音速起子需要好几个世纪
No, no. The sonic would take centuries.

746
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,150
噢 我们最好现在就开始
Oh, we might as well get started.

747
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,240
能打发"时间乱乱"
Help to pass the "Timey-wimey".

748
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,350
你一定要像个小孩儿一样说话吗
Do you have to talk like children?

749
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,320
你为什么耻于长大成熟呢
What is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown-up?

750
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,507
噢 你们俩看我的眼神
Oh, the way you both look at me.

751
00:39:28,508 --> 00:39:30,510
那是什么意思啊
What is that?

752
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,080
我想找一个比"可怕"更好的词来形容
I'm trying to think of a better word than "Dread".

753
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,470
那件事对你来说一定刚发生不久
It must be really recent for you.

754
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,480
不久
Recent?

755
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,057
时间大战 最终之日
The Time War, the last day.

756
00:39:42,058 --> 00:39:43,710
你杀死他们所有人的那一日
The day you killed them all.

757
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,848
我们杀死他们所有人的那一日
The day WE killed them all.

758
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:46,440
一回事
Same thing.

759
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,830
这对他们是历史  已经尘埃落定了
It's history for them. All decided.

760
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,070
他们觉得他们的未来是真实的  他们不了解
They think their future is real - they don't know

761
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,070
这仍然取决于你
it's still up to you.

762
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,590
我不会谈论它的
I don't talk about it.

763
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,228
你没有谈论它
You're not talking about it.

764
00:40:00,229 --> 00:40:01,560
这儿没有别的人
There's no-one else here.

765
00:40:01,561 --> 00:40:02,670
继续啊 问问他们
Go on. Ask them.

766
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,720
问问他们你需要知道的
Ask them what you need to know.

767
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,710
你们有没有数过
Did you ever count?

768
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,040
数过什么
Count what?

769
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,920
那天 Gallifrey星上有多少孩子
How many children there were on Gallifrey that day.

770
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,510
我完全不知道
I have absolutely no idea.

771
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,630
你现在多大了
How old are you now?

772
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,430
啊… 我不知道 我记不清了
Ah...I don't know, I lose track.

773
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,910
我想有1200多岁吧 除非我在撒谎
Twelve hundred and something, I think, unless I'm lying.

774
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,833
我记不得我有没有在年龄上撒谎了
I can't remember if I'm lying about my age -

775
00:40:32,834 --> 00:40:33,670
我就有那么老了
that's how old I am.

776
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,430
比我大400岁
400 years older than me.

777
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,523
在这期间
And in all that time,

778
00:40:36,524 --> 00:40:38,950
你就从没有想过那儿有多少个孩子吗
you've never even wondered how many there were?

779
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,360
你就一次也没有数过
You never once counted?

780
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,350
你告诉我
Tell me...

781
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,670
那有什么意义呢?
what would be the point?

782
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,430
2.47亿
2.47 billion.

783
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,800
你真的算过了
You DID count!

784
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,710
你忘了
You forgot?

785
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,830
才400年  就把这些都泯灭了
400 years? Is that all it takes?

786
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,750
我向前看了
I moved on.

787
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,956
到哪了  你现在前进到了哪儿
Where?! Where can you be

788
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,150
足以让你忘记这样的事
now that you can forget something like that?

789
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,830
- 天机不可泄露   - 不是
- Spoilers.  - No.

790
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,206
不 不是 不是的  就这一次
No, no, no. For once,

791
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:06,390
我想要知道自己将会去向何方
I would like to know where I'm going.

792
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,760
不  你不会想知道的
No. You really wouldn't.

793
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,590
我不知道你们俩是谁  我一个都不认识
I don't know who you are... either of you.

794
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,670
我一点都不清楚
I haven't got the faintest idea.

795
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,120
他们就是你
They're you.

796
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,190
他们就是你的未来
They're what you become

797
00:41:20,191 --> 00:41:21,640
如果你毁灭了Gallifrey
if you destroy Gallifrey.

798
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,120
一个悔恨之人
The man who regrets...

799
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,310
还有一个健忘之人
..And the man who forgets.

800
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,750
那一时刻就要来了
The moment is coming.

801
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,760
那时刻就是我 你必须做出决定
The Moment is me, you have to decide.

802
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,590
不
No.

803
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,880
不
No?

804
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,310
就只是 不
Just...no!

805
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,710
有什么好笑的吗  我错过了哪个笑点吗
Is something funny? Did I miss a funny thing?

806
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,790
抱歉  我就是刚刚想到
Sorry. It just occurred to me.

807
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,800
我一个人的时候就是这样
This is what I'm like when I'm alone.

808
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,200
那是同一个音速起子
It's the same screwdriver.

809
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,400
同样的软件  不同的外壳
Same software...different case.

810
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,950
400年
400 years!

811
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,150
怎么了
I'm sorry?

812
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,452
就软件层面来说
At a software level,

813
00:42:22,453 --> 00:42:24,390
他们是同一个东西 不是吗
they're all the same device, aren't they?

814
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,830
同样的软件 不同的外壳
Same software, different case.

815
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,910
是啊  所以…
Yeah. So...?

816
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,750
所以  音速起子要用几个世纪来计算
So, it would take centuries for the screwdriver to calculate

817
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,510
如何瓦解这扇门  扫描门
how to disintegrate the door. Scanning the door,

818
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,870
把这个运算作为一个永续进行的子程序
implanting the calculation as a permanent subroutine

819
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,230
植入软件系统里
in the software architecture

820
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,510
那么  如果你们真的是我
and...if you really are me,

821
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,070
穿着你那沙滩鞋 戴着你那蝴蝶领结
with your sandshoes and your dicky bow,

822
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,680
而那起子仍然是我的
and that screwdriver is still mine...

823
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,960
那个运算就还在进行
..That calculation is still going on.

824
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,550
是啊  还在运行
Yeah. Still going.

825
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,750
运算完成
Calculation complete.

826
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,510
同样的软件  不同的外壳
Same software. Different face.

827
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,860
哎  400年压缩成了4秒钟
Eh, 400 years in four seconds.

828
00:43:08,861 --> 00:43:10,030
我们也许意见不合
We may have our differences,

829
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,870
在这种情况里还真是奇怪
which is frankly odd in the circumstances,

830
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,325
但是我告诉你们 伙计们
but I tell you what, boys,

831
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:16,160
我们真是聪明绝顶啊
we are incredibly clever!

832
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,790
你怎么做到的
How did you do that?

833
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,470
- 这门没锁   - 好吧
- It wasn't locked.  - Right.

834
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,910
他们都是你 是吧
So they're both you, then, yeah?

835
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,470
是的  你之前见过他们 还记得吗
Yes. You've met them before, don't you remember?

836
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,590
记得一点  很棒的套装啊
A bit. Nice suit!

837
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,910
谢了
Thanks.

838
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,430
等一下
Hang on.

839
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,590
三个你挤在一个牢房里
Three of you in one cell,

840
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:38,430
就没一个能想到来试试这扇门吗
and none of you thought to try the door.

841
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,670
它应该是锁上的啊
It should have been locked.

842
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,510
是啊 就是  为什么它没上锁
Yes, exactly! Why wasn't it locked?

843
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,255
因为我很想看看
Because I was fascinated to see

844
00:43:43,256 --> 00:43:44,990
你们会怎么逃跑
what you would do upon escaping.

845
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,550
我知道你们都很爱这个世界
I understand you're rather fond of this world.

846
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,840
可我想是时候让你们看看将要发生什么了
It's time I think you saw what's going to happen to it.

847
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,880
啊
Ah!

848
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,070
Kate  噢 上帝 你没真的死掉
Kate? Oh, goodness, you're not actually dead.

849
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,880
噢 这可真是重大新闻
Oh, that's tremendous news!

850
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,630
那些生物 他们会把自己变成人们的复制品
Those creatures, they turn themselves into copies.

851
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,510
他们需要让原型活着 刷新影像
And they need to keep the original alive, refresh the image,

852
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,710
可以这么说吧
so to speak.

853
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,470
他们  他们去哪儿了
Where...where did they go?

854
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,299
我不知道  噢 等等
I don't know. Ooh, hang on -

855
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,270
对了我知道  他们去塔里了
yes, I do. The Tower.

856
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,590
如果他们成功进入了黑色档案馆
If those creatures have got access to the Black Archive,

857
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,880
我们可能已经失去控制这颗星球的力量了
we may just have lost control of the planet.

858
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,990
Zygons一族失去了他们自己的世界
The Zygons lost their own world.

859
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,470
时间大战一开始就被焚毁了
It burned in the first days of the Time War.

860
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,800
他们需要一个新家
A new home is required.

861
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,870
所以他们想要这一个
So they want this one?

862
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,470
还不到时候  这里过于原始了
Not yet. Far too primitive.

863
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,310
Zygons对于舒适性有一定要求
Zygons are used to a certain level of comfort.

864
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,480
指挥官
Commander...

865
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,950
为什么这些生物会在这儿
..Why are these creatures here?

866
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,590
因为我让他们在这儿
Because I say they should be.

867
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,240
你也是时候该转译了
It is time you too were translated.

868
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,350
好好看着吧
Observe this.

869
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,350
我相信你们会觉得非常有趣的
I believe you will find it fascinating.

870
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,630
那个是他  就是现在画里的那个Zygon
That's him! That's the Zygon in the picture now.

871
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,950
那不是画  那是一个静态立方
It's not a picture, it's a Stasis Cube.

872
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,750
时间领主艺术
Time Lord art -

873
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,470
冻结的瞬间时刻 里面比外面大
frozen instants in time, bigger on the inside

874
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,830
但是可以用来
but could be deployed as...

875
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,390
- 进入暂停模式  - 噢 这可真棒
- Suspended animation. - Oh, that's very good.

876
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,672
所有的Zygons都被保存在了图片里
The Zygons all pop inside the pictures,

877
00:45:51,673 --> 00:45:52,390
等上个几世纪
wait a few centuries

878
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,329
直到这颗星球变得更有趣一点
till the planet's a bit more interesting,

879
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,230
然后他们再出来
and then out they come.

880
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,350
你瞧 Clara
You see, Clara,

881
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,341
他们被储存在
they're stored in the

882
00:45:57,342 --> 00:45:59,630
地下美术馆的画中 就像是罐装汤饮
paintings in the Under Gallery, like Cup-a-Soups.

883
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,010
除了你加入罐子里的是时间
Except you add time -

884
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:01,990
如果你能想象出来的话
if you can picture that.

885
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,910
没人能想象出那个  忘了我说的罐装汤饮吧
Nobody could picture that. Forget I said Cup-a-Soups.

886
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,070
现在 这个世界已经变得值得侵占了
And now the world is worth conquering.

887
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,150
Zygons便由过去
So the Zygons are invading the future

888
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,470
入侵未来
from the past.

889
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,240
正是这样
Exactly!

890
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,150
然后你知道我怎么看出你是赝品的吗
And do you know why I know that you're a fake?

891
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,750
因为你是份极差的复制品
Because you're such a bad copy.

892
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,470
不仅是味道 或是假冒伪劣的头发
It's not just the smell, or the unconvincing hair,

893
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,764
还是你那穷凶极恶的牙
or the atrocious teeth,

894
00:46:23,765 --> 00:46:26,110
还有靠得有点太近的两眼
or the eyes just a bit too close together,

895
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,670
或者可以熏晕一匹马的口气
or the breath that could stun a horse -

896
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,270
是因为我的伊丽莎白 真正的伊丽莎白
it's because my Elizabeth, the real Elizabeth,

897
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,430
从来不会蠢到透露她自己的计划
would never be stupid enough to reveal her own plan.

898
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,630
说实在的 你为什么要那么做
Honestly, why would you do that?

899
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,150
因为这不是我的计划
Because it's not my plan,

900
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,320
而且 我就是真的伊丽莎白
and I AM the real Elizabeth.

901
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,870
好吧  能不能 倒回一点
OK. So...backtracking a moment,

902
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,550
给我刚刚的话加点背景信息
just to lend some context to my earlier remarks...

903
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,510
我的复制品死在了树林里
My twin is dead in the forest.

904
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,910
我习惯采取预防措施
I am accustomed to taking precautions.

905
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,538
这些Zygon生物甚至想都没想过
These Zygon creatures never

906
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:55,550
我会是幸存下来的那个
even considered that it was me

907
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,990
而不是他们的指挥官
who survived, rather than their own commander.

908
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,550
他们的特点就是骄傲自大
The arrogance that typifies their kind.

909
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,670
Zygon么?
Zygons?

910
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,709
男人们!
Men!

911
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:04,310
你真的杀了他们中的一个吗
And you actually killed one of them?

912
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,710
我也许只是个手无缚鸡之力的女子
I may have the body of a weak and feeble woman,

913
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,510
但那时 那个Zygon也一样
but at the time, so did the Zygon.

914
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,910
我王国的未来处于危险之中
The future of my kingdom is imperilled.

915
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,110
博士 我能依靠你吗
Doctor, can I rely on your service?

916
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,550
嗯 我得需要我的Tardis
Well, I'm going to need my TARDIS.

917
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,990
- 已经准备好了   - 啊哈
- It has been procured already.  - Ah!

918
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,920
但是首先 我亲爱的 你有个承诺要遵守
But first, my love, you have a promise to keep!

919
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,830
我现在宣布 你们正式结为夫妇
I now pronounce you...man and wife.

920
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,160
你可以亲吻新娘了
You may kiss the bride.

921
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,510
这种事儿在未来有很多吗
Is there a lot of this in the future?

922
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,800
是啊 它确实开始发生了
It does start to happen, yeah.

923
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,670
一路平安 我的爱人
God speed, my love.

924
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,600
我马上就回来
I will be right back.

925
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,640
喔
Whoo!

926
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,480
好吧 回到未来
Right, then, back to the future.

927
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,350
你让这地方自生自灭了啊
You've let this place go a bit!

928
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,630
啊 那是他的丑陋时代 他会长大的
Ah, it's his grunge phase. He grows out of it.

929
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,350
别听他们胡说
Don't you listen to them!

930
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,950
噢  控制台出问题了
Ooh! The desktop is glitching.

931
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,909
我们三个来自不同时间
Three of us from different time zones,

932
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:15,150
它正在试着抵消
it's trying to compensate.

933
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,870
嘿 看 那些圆圆的东西
Hey, look, the round things.

934
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,720
我超爱那些圆圆的东西
I love the round things.

935
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:21,070
那些圆的到底是什么
What ARE the round things?

936
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,950
不知道
No idea.

937
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,470
哦 天呐 冲突反销器
Oh, dear, the friction contrafibulator.

938
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,520
哈  看 稳定了
Ha! There! Stabilized.

939
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,190
哦 你重新装修过了
Oh, you've redecorated!

940
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,230
我不喜欢
I don't like it.

941
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,590
噢  噢 对 噢
Oh? Oh, yeah. Oh,

942
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,991
你永远都不喜欢  听着 我们要去
you never do! Listen, we're going

943
00:48:35,992 --> 00:48:38,310
国家美术馆  Zygon们在地下
to the National Gallery - the Zygons are underneath it.

944
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,572
不 是UNIT总部
No, UNIT HQ,

945
00:48:39,573 --> 00:48:41,200
他们跟着我们去了黑色档案馆
they followed us there in the Black Archive.

946
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,760
好吧  你们现在都知道了
OK...so you've heard of that, then.

947
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,258
{\pos(153,230)}UNIT 伦敦塔

948
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,150
这里的设备都非同寻常
The equipment here is phenomenal.

949
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,993
人类都不知道这里一大半的设备
The humans don't realise

950
00:48:52,994 --> 00:48:53,910
是用来做什么的
what half this stuff does -

951
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,790
凭借它们 我们一天之内就能征服他们的世界
we could conquer their world in a day.

952
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,190
那我们很幸运
We were fortunate, then...

953
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,470
选择了正确的复制对象
in our choice of duplicate.

954
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,430
如果我是人类 我会称之为圣诞狂欢
If I were human, I'd say it was Christmas.

955
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,565
不 恐怕你们的美梦要落空了
No. I'm afraid you wouldn't.

956
00:49:06,566 --> 00:49:08,550
我们没有武器  你们不必紧张
We're not armed. You may relax.

957
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,070
我们有武器  你们需要紧张
We are armed. You may not.

958
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,870
锁住大门
Lock the door.

959
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,800
恐怕我们不能被打断
I'm afraid we can't be interrupted.

960
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,350
不介意我舒舒服服地坐下吧
You don't mind if I get comfortable?

961
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,360
不介意我也这么做吧
You don't mind if I do?

962
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:32,510
你们知道存在保护此地的协议吧
You'll realise there are protocols protecting this place.

963
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,510
- Osgood   - 如遇外星人入侵
- Osgood...   - In the event of alien incursion,

964
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,670
这间房间内的物体被判定极为危险
the contents of this room are deemed so dangerous,

965
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,030
它会自我毁灭 就在... 在五分钟后
it will self-destruct in... Five minutes.

966
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,190
在我们下方20英尺 有一个核弹头
There's a nuclear warhead 20 feet beneath us.

967
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,670
你坐得还舒服么
Are you sitting comfortably?

968
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,630
你会摧毁伦敦吗
You would destroy London?

969
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,430
为了拯救这个世界  是的 我会的
To save the world? Yes, I would.

970
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,670
你只是在虚张声势
You're bluffing.

971
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,950
你真的那么认为吗
You really think so?

972
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,750
在你的记忆中 有一个男人
Somewhere in your memory is a man called

973
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,990
他叫Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart
Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart.

974
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,190
我是他的女儿
I'm his daughter.

975
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,634
"科学至上" Kate
"Science leads," Kate.

976
00:49:59,635 --> 00:50:00,950
你那句话就想表达这个吗
Is that what you meant?

977
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,510
这就是你父亲想表达的么?
Is this what your father meant?'

978
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,990
- 博士   - 时空电报 Kate
- Doctor?   - Space-Time Telegraph, Kate.

979
00:50:03,404 --> 00:50:05,390
{\pos(165,80)}时空电报

980
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,455
这是我给你父亲的礼物
A gift from me to your father,

981
00:50:06,456 --> 00:50:07,910
直通TARDIS的专线
hotline straight to the TARDIS.

982
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,166
我知道黑色档案馆
I know about the Black

983
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:11,830
我也知道安全协议
Archive and I know about the security protocol.

984
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,150
Kate 求你
Kate, please,

985
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,549
请你告诉我
please, tell me you are not

986
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,710
你不会做出什么蠢得惊人的事
about to do something unbelievably stupid!

987
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,550
我很抱歉 博士  把它关掉
I'm sorry, Doctor. Switch it off.

988
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,590
你晚些会更抱歉的
Not as sorry as you will be.

989
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,440
你永远都承受不了这个决定的后果
This is not a decision you will ever be able to live with.

990
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,229
Kate 我们正试着把TARDIS开过去
Kate! We're trying to bring the TARDIS in -

991
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,270
为什么我们无法降落
why can't we land?

992
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,430
我说把它关掉
I said switch it off!

993
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,720
不要 Kate 求你 听我说
No, Kate, please, just listen to me...

994
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,310
伦敦塔 完全防TARDIS
The Tower of London - totally TARDIS-proof.

995
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,590
他们怎么做到的
How can they do that?

996
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,750
外星科技加上人类的愚蠢
Alien technology plus human stupidity -

997
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,110
相信我 那就战无不胜了
trust me, it's unbeatable.

998
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,600
我们不需要降落
We don't need to land.

999
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,070
我们多少还是要的  争取跟上吧
Yeah, we do, a tiny bit. Try and keep up.

1000
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:58,840
不一定  不一定  还有别的方法
No, we don't. We don't. There is another way.

1001
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,680
罐装汤饮
Cup-a-Soup!

1002
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,920
罐装汤饮是什么
What is Cup-a-Soup?

1003
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,070
出什么事了
What happened?

1004
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,680
直接带你去看吧
Easier to show you.

1005
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,150
我是McGillop
McGillop.

1006
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,680
看一眼电话 确认你在和谁说话
Take a look at your phone and confirm who you're talking to.

1007
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,030
但那不可能啊 我刚刚
But that's not possible. I was just...

1008
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,950
你刚刚还在和我说话 我知道
You were just talking to me, I know.

1009
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,550
我是个时间旅行者 想得明白吧
I'm a time traveller - figure it out.

1010
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,501
我需要你把
I need you to send the

1011
00:51:35,502 --> 00:51:37,470
Gallifrey陷落的油画送到黑色档案馆去
Gallifrey Falls painting to the Black Archive.

1012
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,310
- 明白吗   - 明白 长官
- Understood? - Understood, sir.

1013
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,390
但为什么要把它送到那里去
But why would I take it there?

1014
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,230
你说句话就可以取消倒计时
One word from you would cancel the countdown.

1015
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,270
没错
Quite so.

1016
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,790
你的声纹就是钥匙
It's keyed to your voice print.

1017
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,830
只有我一个人的
And mine alone.

1018
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,230
不再是了  取消爆炸
Not any more. Cancel the detonation!

1019
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,150
- 指令撤回   - 取消爆炸
- Countermanded! - Cancel the detonation!

1020
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,390
指令撤回
Countermanded!

1021
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,790
我们得求同才能生存
We only have to agree, to live.

1022
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,910
很不幸 我们只能一同死亡了
Sadly, we can only agree to die.

1023
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,990
求你 博士  请救救我们
Please, Doctor. Please save us.

1024
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,230
请救救我们 请救救我们
Please save us. Please save us.

1025
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,160
救救我们
Please save us...

1026
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,040
消灭
Exterminate!

1027
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,510
大家好
Hello.

1028
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,590
我是博士
I'm the Doctor.

1029
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,960
抱歉有个Dalek
Sorry about the Dalek.

1030
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,150
还有卖弄
Also the showing off.

1031
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,943
Kate Lethbridge-Stewart
Kate Lethbridge-Stewart,

1032
00:52:55,944 --> 00:52:58,990
以明智的名义 你究竟在干什么
what in the name of sanity are you doing?

1033
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,510
倒计时只能在我的个人指令下停止
The countdown can only be halted at my personal command.

1034
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,190
你无能为力
There's nothing you can do.

1035
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,670
除了让你们两个都同意中止
Except make you both agree to halt it.

1036
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,990
即使有三个你也做不到
Not even for three of you.

1037
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,190
你将杀害百万人
You're about to murder millions of people.

1038
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,049
以此拯救数十亿人
To save billions.

1039
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:12,310
你做过多少次这种计算了
How many times have you made that calculation?

1040
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,790
只有一次
Once.

1041
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,280
将我变成了现在的样子
Turned me into the man I am now.

1042
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,470
我都不确定我是谁了
I'm not even sure who that is any more.

1043
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,070
你告诉自己你有正当理由 但那是个谎言
You tell yourself it's justified, but it's a lie.

1044
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,670
因为我那天的所作所为是错误的  完全错了
Because what I did that day was wrong. Just wrong.

1045
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,070
因为我做错了
And because I got it wrong...

1046
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,360
我会让你... 做正确的事
I'm going to make you... get it right.

1047
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,390
怎样
How?

1048
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,030
从现在起的某一秒 你们要停止倒计时
Any second now, you're going to stop that countdown.

1049
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,190
你们两个 一起
Both of you. Together.

1050
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:38,984
然后你们要
Then you're going to

1051
00:53:38,985 --> 00:53:40,790
谈妥有史以来最完美的协定
negotiate the most perfect treaty of all time.

1052
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,670
防护员就在近旁 对双方都很公正
Safeguards all around, compeletly fair on both sides.

1053
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,310
完美谈判的关键就在于
And the key to perfect negotiation...

1054
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,750
不知道你站在哪一边
Not knowing what side you're on.

1055
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,110
所以 接下来的几个小时
So, for the next few hours...

1056
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,590
直到我们决定放你们出去为止
until we decide to let you out...

1057
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,013
在这间房间里的人都
No-one in this room will

1058
00:53:52,014 --> 00:53:53,270
不会记得他是人类
be able to remember if they're human...

1059
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,310
还是Zygon
..Or Zygon.

1060
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,080
好呀
Whoops-a-daisy!

1061
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,160
取消爆炸
Cancel the detonation!

1062
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,280
和平降临我们的时代了
Peace in our time.

1063
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,790
很有趣 不是吗
It's funny, isn't it?

1064
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,350
如果我是Zygon 那我的衣服也是Zygon
If I'm a Zygon, then my clothes must be Zygon too.

1065
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,110
如果我丢掉一只鞋会怎样呢
So, what happens if I lose a shoe or something?

1066
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,560
哎呀
Oh!

1067
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,230
你好
Hello.

1068
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,910
- 你好   - 我是Clara
Hello. I'm Clara.

1069
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,710
我们还没真正见过面呢
We haven't really met yet.

1070
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,880
我很期待认识你
I look forward to it.

1071
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,710
有问题吗
Is there a problem?

1072
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,190
博士 我是说我的
The Doctor - my...

1073
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,590
我的博士
my Doctor -

1074
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,670
他总是谈论他做出那件事的那天
he's always talking about the day he did it,

1075
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,910
他毁灭所有时间领主来终止战争的那一天
the day he wiped out the Time Lords to stop the war...

1076
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,670
他有理由谈论它
One would.

1077
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,040
而你不会
You wouldn't.

1078
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,520
因为你还没有做
Because you haven't done it yet.

1079
00:55:31,521 --> 00:55:33,040
那还在你的未来里
It's still in your future.

1080
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,150
你对此非常自信
You're very sure of yourself.

1081
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:41,190
他很后悔 我每天都能从他眼睛里看出来
He regrets it. I see it in his eyes every day.

1082
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,710
他会不惜一切改变当时发生的事
He'd do anything to change it.

1083
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,600
包括拯救这些人么
Including saving all these people.

1084
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,790
你觉得 他的悔恨拯救了多少个世界呢
How many worlds has his regret saved, do you think?

1085
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,468
看看那边吧
Look over there -

1086
00:55:52,469 --> 00:55:56,640
人类和Zygon和平地解决问题
humans and Zygons working together in peace.

1087
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,840
你怎么知道我还没做
How did you know?

1088
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,160
你的眼睛
Your eyes.

1089
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,400
你年轻许多
You're so much younger.

1090
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,800
那么 综合考虑
Then, all things considered...

1091
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,680
是我成长的时候了
..It's time I grew up.

1092
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,760
我已经眼见了我需要看的一切
I've seen all I needed.

1093
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,640
时刻到了
The moment has come.

1094
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,710
我准备好了
I'm ready.

1095
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:29,710
我知道
I know you are.

1096
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,120
谁在那  你在和谁说话
Who's there? Who were you talking to...?

1097
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:52,070
你想要个红色的大按钮的
You wanted a big red button.

1098
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:56,230
一场大爆炸 不再有时间领主
One big bang - no more Time Lords,

1099
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,430
不再有Dalek
no more Daleks.

1100
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,840
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1101
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,320
我进来前就确定了
I was sure when I came in here.

1102
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,470
没有别的出路
There is no other way.

1103
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,550
你看到了你将要变成的人
You've seen the men you will become.

1104
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,430
他们
Those men...

1105
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,000
非同寻常
extraordinary.

1106
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,790
他们就是你
They were you.

1107
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,160
不
No.

1108
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,710
他们是博士
They were the Doctor.

1109
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,950
你也是
You're the Doctor too.

1110
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,400
不
No.

1111
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,400
烈火铸就伟人
Great men are forged in fire.

1112
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,080
小人有幸点燃烈火
It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame...

1113
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,110
无论代价几何
..Whatever the cost.

1114
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,710
你知道TADRIS的声音吗
You know the sound the TARDIS makes?

1115
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,760
那呼哧呼哧的呻吟声
That wheezing...groaning.

1116
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,840
那声音无论到往何处 都能带来希望
That sound brings hope wherever it goes.

1117
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,350
是的 是的 我喜欢这么想
Yes. Yes, I like to think it does.

1118
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,440
给每一个听到的人 博士
To anyone who hears it, Doctor.

1119
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,320
任何人 不管他怎样迷失
Anyone, however lost...

1120
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,040
即使是你
..Even you!

1121
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,800
我告诉过你 他还没有做
I told you - he hasn't done it yet.

1122
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,030
离开这 你们全都离开
Go away now, all of you.

1123
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,400
这事由我来做
This is for me.

1124
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,514
这些事件都应该被时间锁定了
These events should be time locked -

1125
00:58:44,515 --> 00:58:45,710
我们甚至都不该在这儿
we shouldn't even be here.

1126
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,350
是有什么东西让我们通过了
So something let us through.

1127
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,910
机灵的男孩们
You clever boys!

1128
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,070
回去
Go back.

1129
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,560
回到你们的生活
Go back to your lives.

1130
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,870
去做那个我永远不能成为的博士
Go and be the Doctor that I could never be.

1131
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,720
让这一切都值得
Make it worthwhile.

1132
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,760
这么多年 我将你埋藏于记忆中
All those years, burying you in my memory.

1133
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,830
假装你并不存在
Pretending you didn't exist.

1134
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,440
将你当作秘密 甚至对我自己
Keeping you a secret, even from myself.

1135
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,350
假装你不是博士
Pretending you weren't the Doctor,

1136
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,750
你却比任何人都够格做博士
when you were the Doctor more than anybody else.

1137
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,289
你就是博士
You were the Doctor on

1138
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:25,280
在不可能做出正确选择的日子
the day it wasn't possible to get it right.

1139
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,080
但这次
But this time...

1140
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,440
你不必一人完成
..You don't have to do it alone.

1141
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,720
谢谢
Thank you.

1142
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:48,280
我们今日的作为 不是出于恐惧或者仇恨
What we do today is not out of fear or hatred.

1143
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,240
我们如此作为 是因为别无选择
It is done because there is no other way.

1144
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,496
是以我们没能拯救的无数生命之名
And it is done in the name

1145
00:59:55,497 --> 00:59:58,360
来完成这件事
of the many lives we are failing to save.

1146
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,240
什么
What?

1147
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,750
是什么 怎么了
What is it, what?

1148
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,960
没事
Nothing...

1149
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,830
不对 有事  告诉我
No.It's something. Tell me!

1150
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,411
你告诉我 你毁灭了自己的种族
You told me you wiped out your own people.

1151
01:00:21,412 --> 01:00:22,440
我只是...
I just...

1152
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:28,150
我从来没有想象过你这么做 就这样
I never pictured you doing it, that's all.

1153
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,600
近一些看
Take a closer look.

1154
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,150
这是什么
What's happening?

1155
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,760
什么都没有 这只是投影
Nothing - it's a projection.

1156
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,520
这是你们身边的现实
It's a reality around you.

1157
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,280
你们要焚毁这些人吗
These are the people you're going to burn?

1158
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,990
我们无能为力
There isn't anything we can do.

1159
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,230
他说得对
He's right.

1160
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,230
没有另一条出路 从来就没有
There isn't another way, there never was.

1161
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:13,470
我要么毁灭我的同胞 要么任由宇宙焚毁
Either I destroy my own people or let the universe burn.

1162
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,040
看看你们
Look at you...

1163
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,390
你们三个
..The three of you.

1164
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,430
一个战士 一个英雄
The warrior. The hero.

1165
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,840
还有你
And you.

1166
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,190
我是什么
And what am I?

1167
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,710
你真的忘记了吗
Have you really forgotten?

1168
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,630
是的 也许 是的
Yes. Maybe, yes.

1169
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,830
我们有足够的战士
We've got enough warriors -

1170
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,480
随便一个老傻瓜也能当英雄
any old idiot can be hero.

1171
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,600
那我要做什么
Then what do I do?

1172
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,720
做你一直在做的
What you've always done.

1173
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,240
当个博士(医生)
Be a doctor!

1174
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,790
你说过你选择的名字是个承诺
You told me the name you chose was a promise.

1175
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,040
是什么承诺呢
What was the promise?

1176
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,000
永不残酷也不懦弱
Never cruel or cowardly.

1177
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,310
永不放弃
Never give up,

1178
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,960
永不屈服
never give in.

1179
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,795
你不是真的在建议
You're not actually suggesting

1180
01:02:41,796 --> 01:02:44,190
我们改变自己的历史吧
that we change our own personal history?

1181
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,350
我们一直都在改变历史
We change history all the time.

1182
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,550
我只是在提议糟糕得多的事
I'm suggesting something far worse.

1183
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,120
究竟 是什么
What, exactly?

1184
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:58,720
先生们 我用了400年的时间来思考这件事
Gentleman, I have had 400 years to think about this.

1185
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,360
我改主意了
I've changed my mind.

1186
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:11,070
那里仍有成百上千亿亿的Daleks在攻击
There's still a billion billion Daleks up there, attacking.

1187
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,790
是的 一直都有
Yeah, there is, there is.

1188
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,819
可是有一些事
But there's something

1189
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:16,150
是那么多的Daleks都不知道啊
those billion billion Daleks don't know.

1190
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,435
因为如果他们知道的话
Cos if they did,

1191
01:03:17,436 --> 01:03:18,710
他们很可能会加派援军了
they'd probably send for reinforcements.

1192
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,270
它们还不知道什么?
What, what don't they know?

1193
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,990
这次 我们有三个呢
This time, there's three of us.

1194
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,710
噢
Oh!

1195
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,510
哦  哦 是的 太棒了
Oh! Oh, yes, that is good!

1196
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,150
真是好主意
That is brilliant!

1197
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:32,110
噢 噢 噢  我也想到了  真是聪明绝顶
Oh, oh, oh! I'm getting that too - that is brilliant!

1198
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:36,310
哈哈哈  我都想了几世纪了
Ha-ha-ha! I've been thinking about it for centuries!

1199
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,750
她不是随便找了段未来给我看
She didn't just show me any old future -

1200
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:42,190
她给我看了我正需要看到的未来
she showed me exactly the future I needed to see!

1201
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,510
- 现在你正跟上了   - 什么 谁做的
- Now you're getting it.  - Eh? Who did?

1202
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,830
噢 恶狼姑娘 我都要亲你了!
Oh, Bad Wolf Girl, I could kiss you.

1203
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,695
是的 以后那会发生的
Yep, that's going to happen.

1204
01:03:48,696 --> 01:03:50,550
打扰下 你刚说了什么 恶狼
Sorry, did you say, "Bad Wolf"?

1205
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,990
那我们要做什么  计划是什么
So what are we doing? What's the plan?

1206
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,124
Daleks部队正围攻Gallifrey
The Dalek fleets are surrounding Gallifrey,

1207
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:56,310
进行持续不断的炮火攻击
firing on it constantly.

1208
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,443
空中战壕还在支撑
The Sky Trench is holding,

1209
01:03:57,444 --> 01:03:59,190
可要是整个星球消失了会怎样呢
but what if the whole planet just disappeared?

1210
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,670
我再问一小点点
Tiny bit of an ask.

1211
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,190
Daleks就会相互射击
The Daleks would be firing on each other -

1212
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,070
他们会在交叉火力中自我毁灭
they'd destroy themselves in their own crossfire.

1213
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,470
Gallifrey会消失 Daleks被毁灭
Gallifrey would be gone, the Daleks would be destroyed,

1214
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,510
在宇宙的其他部分看来
and it would look to the rest of the universe

1215
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,470
就像他们相互毁灭了一样
as if they'd annihilated each other.

1216
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,680
- 但Gallifrey会在哪   - 冻结起来
- But where would Gallifrey be?  - Frozen!

1217
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,990
冻结在一瞬的时间中
Frozen in an instant of time,

1218
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,070
安全地隐藏起来
safe and hidden away.

1219
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,150
没错
Exactly!

1220
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,960
就像一幅油画
Like a painting.

1221
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,550
又一条消息
Another one!

1222
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:42,254
{\pos(240,150)}Gallifrey
伫立不倒

1223
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,710
你确定消息来自于他
Are you sure the message is from him?

1224
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,400
是的  可他为什么要这么做呢
Oh, yes! Why would he do that?

1225
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,190
这个疯疯癫癫的傻子现在又说什么了
What's the mad fool talking about now?

1226
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,990
你好 你好 Gallifrey最高指挥部
Hello, hello, Gallifrey High Command,

1227
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,430
我是博士
this is the Doctor speaking.

1228
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,470
你好  我也是博士 你能听得我讲话吗
Hello! Also the Doctor. Can you hear me?

1229
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,590
我也是博士 准备好了
Also the Doctor - standing ready.

1230
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,654
上帝啊 有三个博士
Dear God, three of them!

1231
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:55,270
我所有最可怕的噩梦同时再现了
All my worst nightmares at once!

1232
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,668
统帅 我们有个计划
General, we have a plan.

1233
01:04:56,669 --> 01:04:57,950
我们得指出 此时此刻
We should point out, at this moment,

1234
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,567
这是个很糟糕的计划
it is a fairly terrible plan.

1235
01:04:59,568 --> 01:05:00,830
而且几乎肯定会失败
And almost certainly won't work.

1236
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,710
说"很糟糕"已经足够了吧
I was happy with "Fairly terrible".

1237
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,350
抱歉 我刚把心里想法说出来了
'Sorry, just thinking out loud.'

1238
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,040
我们正把我们的三个TARDIS飞到你们的低空
We're flying our three TARDISes into your lower atmosphere.

1239
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,870
我们在星球周围等距布阵
We're positioned at equidistant intervals round the globe.

1240
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,360
等距  听起来真成熟
"Equidistant" - so grown-up!

1241
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,830
我们准备好要做了
We're just about ready to do it.

1242
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,710
准备好做什么?
Ready to do what?

1243
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,710
我们将要封存Gallifrey
We're going to freeze Gallifrey.

1244
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,630
不好意思 你说什么
I'm sorry, what?

1245
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,150
利用我们的TARDIS
Using our TARDISes,

1246
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,790
我们要把Gallifrey封存在时光里的一瞬
we're going to freeze Gallifrey in a single moment in time.

1247
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,070
你知道的 就像静态立方一样
You know, like those Stasis Cubes?

1248
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:35,030
时光中的一瞬 封存在平行的口袋宇宙中
A single moment in time held in a parallel pocket universe.

1249
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,030
不过 我们将对整个星球这么做
Except we're going to do it to a whole planet.

1250
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,270
以及星球上的所有人
And all the people on it.

1251
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,710
什么 即使这是可能的
What? Even if that were possible,

1252
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,790
而实际上不可能 你们为什么要这么做?
which it isn't,why would you do such a thing?

1253
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,996
因为另一个选择是焚毁星球
Because the alternative is burning.

1254
01:05:45,997 --> 01:05:47,030
我亲眼目睹过
And I've seen that.

1255
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,360
我永远都不想再看一次了
And I never want to see it again.

1256
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,000
我们会在另一个宇宙迷失的
We'd be lost in another universe...

1257
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,110
封存于一瞬间中
..Frozen in a single moment.

1258
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,750
我们就一无所有了
We'd have nothing.

1259
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,390
你们还会有希望
You would have hope.

1260
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:02,110
但现在 你们却连希望也没有
And right now, that is exactly what you don't have.

1261
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,950
真是妄想 光是运算
It's delusional. The calculations alone

1262
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,190
就会花上几百年的时间
would take...hundreds of years.

1263
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,470
是的 数以百年的时间
Oh, hundreds and hundreds.

1264
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,750
不过别担心
But don't worry -

1265
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:13,040
很早之前我就开始算了!
I started a very long time ago!

1266
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,953
呼叫Gallifrey军事委员会
Calling the War Council of Gallifrey,

1267
01:06:18,954 --> 01:06:19,630
我是博士
this is the Doctor.

1268
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:23,270
你可以说 我的一生都在做这个
You might say, I've been doing this all my lives!

1269
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,194
- 好运   - 准备好了
- Good luck!  - Stand by.

1270
01:06:25,195 --> 01:06:26,870
- 好了吗   - 开始计算
- Ready?  - Commencing calculations.

1271
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,110
马上就到
Soon be there.

1272
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,710
穿越分割宇宙的界限
Across the boundaries that divide one universe from another.

1273
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,030
只要锁定它的坐标就行
Just got to lock on to his coordinates.

1274
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,550
还有我的下个把戏
And for my next trick...!

1275
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:37,057
我真不知道什么时候能过得好点
I didn't know when I was well off!

1276
01:06:37,058 --> 01:06:38,150
一共12个博士
All 12 of them!

1277
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,360
不 先生
No, sir...

1278
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,640
是13个
..All 13!

1279
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,870
长官  Dalek发现不对劲了
Sir! The Daleks know that something is happening.

1280
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,080
他们在增加火力
They're increasing their fire power.

1281
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,990
做吧 博士
Do it, Doctor.

1282
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,590
尽管做吧
Just do it.

1283
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,080
这么做吧
Do it!

1284
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,430
好
Ok.

1285
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,880
先生们 我们准备好了
Gentleman...we're ready.

1286
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:17,270
我们来了
Geronimo...!

1287
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,310
走咯
Allons-y!

1288
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,750
噢 看在上帝的份上
Oh, for God's sake!

1289
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,920
Gallifrey伫立不倒
Gallifrey stands!

1290
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,680
我想我们永远也不会知道我们有没有真的成功
I don't suppose we'll ever know if we actually succeeded.

1291
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,510
但就算再糟
But at worst,

1292
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,790
我们也只是没做成功正确的事
we failed doing the right thing,

1293
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:52,040
而不是做成功了错误的事
as opposed to succeeding in doing the wrong.

1294
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,840
说起生命和灵魂 你可真深奥
Life and soul, you are.

1295
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,400
这究竟叫什么
What is it actually called?

1296
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,430
恩 有些争议
Well, there's some debate.

1297
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,030
要么是 不再
Either No More

1298
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,110
要么是 Gallifrey陷落
or Gallifrey Falls.

1299
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,950
这可不够鼓舞人心
Not very encouraging.

1300
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,280
它怎么到这的
How did it get here?

1301
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,590
不清楚
No idea.

1302
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,550
总有些我们不知道的事 对吧
There's always something we don't know, isn't there?

1303
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,750
是该这么希望
One should certainly hope so.

1304
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,630
那 先生们
Well, gentlemen...

1305
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,070
和你们共事是我的荣耀
it has been an honour...

1306
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,590
和荣幸
and a privilege.

1307
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,960
我也是 博士
Likewise. Doctor.

1308
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,950
要是我能成为你的一半
And if I grow to be half the man

1309
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:35,150
那么好的人 Clara Oswald
that you are, Clara Oswald,

1310
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,110
我会很欣慰的
I shall be happy indeed.

1311
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,520
那就对了  要胸怀大志哦
That's right - aim high!

1312
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,430
我不会记得这个的 对吧
I won't remember this, will I?

1313
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,030
时间流不同步了
The time streams are out of sync.

1314
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,310
你不会保留这个记忆 不
You can't retain it, no.

1315
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:55,190
所以我不会记得我曾奋力援救Gallifrey
So I won't remember that I tried to save Gallifrey,

1316
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,920
而不是烧毁它
rather than burn it.

1317
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,240
我不得不接受并勉力活下去
I'll have to live with that.

1318
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,190
但是现在
But for now,

1319
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,320
此刻
for this moment...

1320
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,560
我又成为了博士
..I am the Doctor again.

1321
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,800
谢谢你们
Thank you.

1322
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,800
哪个是我的
Which one is mine?!

1323
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,560
哈
Ha!

1324
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,990
噢 是的
Oh, yes...

1325
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,760
当然 这就对了
Course, suppose it makes sense...

1326
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,280
我都有点等得不耐烦了
Wearing a bit thin.

1327
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:50,880
{\a6}吐槽九叔的招风耳

1328
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:49,880
我希望这次耳朵能不那么显眼
I hope the ears are bit less conspicuous this time.

1329
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,360
我也不会记得这个 所以你还是告诉我吧
I won't remember either, so you might as well tell me.

1330
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,270
告诉你什么
Tell you what?

1331
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,040
你一直不想说的 我们将去向何方
Where it is we're going that you don't want to talk about.

1332
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,430
我看到了Trenzalore
I saw Trenzalore...

1333
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:23,880
我们将被埋葬在那里
where we're buried.

1334
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:27,320
我们和百万人一同死于战场
We die in battle among millions.

1335
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,670
不应如此
That's not how it's supposed to be.

1336
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,320
故事就是这么结束的  我们无力改变
That's how the story ends - nothing we can do about it.

1337
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,040
Trenzalore就是你最终去处
Trenzalore is where you're going.

1338
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,920
噢 话别说绝了
Oh, never say nothing.

1339
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,790
不论如何
Anyway...

1340
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,520
很高兴知道我的未来是安全的
good to know my future is in safe hands.

1341
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,350
要看紧些啊 Clara
Keep a tight hold on it, Clara.

1342
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,240
恩  没问题
Mm! On it!

1343
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,670
Trenzalore
Trenzalore.

1344
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,360
我们需要个新的目的地 因为
We need a new destination, because...

1345
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,320
我不想去
..I don't want to go.

1346
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,320
{\a6}"I don't want to go."
10任重生前的最后一句话 "我不想走"

1347
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,800
他总是那么说
He always says that.

1348
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,400
你需要和你的画独处一会儿吗
Need a moment alone with your painting?

1349
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,957
你怎么知道的
How did you know?

1350
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:35,280
- 那双悲伤的大眼睛   - 啊
- Those big, sad eyes. - Ah.

1351
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,800
我总是知道的
I always know.

1352
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,750
哦 对了 有个老人找你
Oh, by the way, there was an old man looking for you.

1353
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,280
我觉得他是馆长
I think it was the curator.

1354
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,590
我也可以做馆长
I could be a curator.

1355
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,750
我会干得很好的
I'd be great at curating.

1356
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,480
我会是一个... 很棒的馆长
I'd be...the great curator.

1357
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,280
我可以退休然后干这行
I could retire and do that.

1358
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,880
我可以退休以后在这里做馆长
I could retire and be the curator of this place.

1359
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,444
其实 我真觉得你有可能会这么做
You know, I really think you might.

1360
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,030
我从不会忘记一张脸
I never forget a face.

1361
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,750
我知道你不会 而且在将来
I know you don't, and in years to come,

1362
01:12:41,182 --> 01:12:43,991
{\a6}第四任博士的演员 Tom Baker

1363
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,590
你也许会发现自己重新换上了几个老面孔
you might find yourself revisiting a few

1364
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,120
不过只是... 那些最喜欢的老面孔 是吧
but just...the old favourites, eh?

1365
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,430
我猜 你对这幅画很好奇
You were curious about this painting, I think.

1366
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,590
我在十分不寻常的情形下得到了它
I acquired it in remarkable circumstances.

1367
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,430
你觉得它的标题怎么样
What do you make of the title?

1368
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,440
哪个标题  有两个呢
Which title? There's two.

1369
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,240
不再
No More...

1370
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,510
或是Gallifrey陷落
..Or Gallifrey Falls?

1371
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,030
哦 你瞧 人人都把这搞错
Oh, you see, that's where everybody's wrong.

1372
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,240
只有一个名字
It's all one title.

1373
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,870
Gallifrey不再陷落
Gallifrey Falls No More.

1374
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:20,760
现在 你觉得那是什么意思 恩
Now, what would you think that means, eh?

1375
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,440
Gallifrey没有陷落
That Gallifrey didn't fall.

1376
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:29,270
成功了  它还存在着
It worked. It's still out there.

1377
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,710
我只是个小小的馆长  我可什么都不知道
I'm only a humble curator - I'm sure I wouldn't know.

1378
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,710
- 那它在哪   - 是啊 它在哪
- Then where is it? - Where is it indeed?

1379
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,630
失落了 别说了 也许吧
Lost. shh! perhaps.

1380
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,390
东西都是会丢的 你知道
Things do get lost, you know.

1381
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,310
现在 失陪了
Now you must excuse me.

1382
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,670
噢
Oh...

1383
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,830
你有好多事情要做
you have a lot to do.

1384
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,221
是吗   - 嗯
Do I? - Mm.

1385
01:13:46,222 --> 01:13:47,390
我现在该做这事了吗
Is that what I'm supposed to do now?

1386
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,047
去寻找Gallifrey?
Go looking for Gallifrey?

1387
01:13:49,048 --> 01:13:51,750
噢 那完全取决于你  是你的选择
Oh, it's entirely up to you. Your choice.

1388
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,550
我只能告诉你我会怎么做
I can only tell you what I would do,

1389
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,110
如果我是你的话
if I were you...

1390
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,630
噢 如果我是你
Oh...! If I were you...

1391
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,710
也许我曾是你 当然
Perhaps I WAS you, of course.

1392
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,190
不过也许...
Or perhaps...

1393
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,030
你是我
you are me.

1394
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,870
祝贺你
Congratulations.

1395
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:08,070
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

1396
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:11,510
或者怎样都不重要
Or perhaps it doesn't matter either way.

1397
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,790
谁知道呢
Who knows?

1398
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,520
谁... 又知道呢
Who...knows?

1399
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,520
{\a6}此处以手指鼻子(nose) 与知道(knows)谐音

1400
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,150
Clara有时问我 我会不会做梦
Clara sometimes asks me if I dream.

1401
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,550
"我当然会做梦" 我告诉她
"Course I dream," I tell her.

1402
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,870
"人人都会做梦"
"Everybody dreams."

1403
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,750
"但你会梦到什么呢" 她会问
"But what do you dream about?" She'll ask.

1404
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:46,350
"人人都会梦到的东西" 我告诉她
"The same thing everybody dreams about," I tell her.

1405
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,910
"我梦到我去的地方"
"I dream about where I'm going."

1406
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,990
她总会笑起来
She always laughs at that.

1407
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,667
"但你哪也不去呀
"But you're not going anywhere -

1408
01:14:52,668 --> 01:14:54,150
你只是乱逛而已"
you're just wandering about."

1409
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:57,360
那不对  不再是
That's not true. Not any more.

1410
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,070
我有了一个新的目的地
I have a new destination.

1411
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:04,630
我的旅程和你们的一样 和所有人都一样
My journey is the same as yours, the same as anyone's.

1412
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,630
它花费了我那么多年 那么多次生命
It's taken me so many years, so many lifetimes,

1413
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:11,030
但我终于知道我将去往何处
but at last I know where I'm going,

1414
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,840
我一直在去往何处
where I've always been going.

1415
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,040
回家  只不过绕了漫漫长路
Home...the long way round.'
