00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:31,308
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"and we saw ourselves at once in a difficult and dangerous position.

3
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:34,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Something must speedily be resolved upon, and it occurred to us...

00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:46,756
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"we ran out at once in the gathering evening and the frosty fog.

00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:49,392
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"The hamlet lay not many hundred yards away...

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"it was in an opposite direction...from that whence the blind man had made his appearance.

00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:01,604
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"And I shall never forget how much I was cheered...

00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:22,685
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. But they don't wanna have anything to do with him.

00:04:03,153 --> 00:04:05,622
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. It's supposed to be a business about caring.

00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:08,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They couldn't care less.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait. This is Terrebonne Parish. It's the freaking swamps.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get the hours I need to start nursing school, and I get paid.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm 25 years old. What's wrong with a little change?

00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:41,157

00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:53,903
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't help anybody who doesn't want my help.

00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of what? Politeness?

92
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:00,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. He's the love of her life and he's dying.

93

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They've been together forever.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you being here means he's really dying.

00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:26,969
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's dying whether I'm here or not.

103
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:29,872
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What'd she mean about the house?

104
00:10:29,872 --> 00:10:31,007
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

105
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:35,845
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said I wouldn't understand the house. Why'd she said that?

106
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:39,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All I know is her checks clear.

107
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:41,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, forget it.

108
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:45,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If it makes you feel any better, I'm still looking for my dream job, too.

109
00:10:45,922 --> 00:10:48,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

110
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:52,888
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So if you talked to her, what would you say?

111
00:10:53,162 --> 00:10:55,298
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd say she could look all she wants...

112
00:10:55,298 --> 00:10:58,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but I doubt she'd find any better than you.

113
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,328
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So she'd do well to treat you like it.

114
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:06,909
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, here are my rules. No knitting.

115
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:09,178
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No joining a bridge club.

116
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:11,213
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And no playing bingo.

117
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, good. Good rules.

118
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:16,986
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm serious, they'll try and suck you into their elderly ways.

119
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:19,388
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's less than an hour away. I'll be back all the time.

00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:24,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, well, you better. Whenever you want to talk to someone who wasn't around for World War II.

121
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jeez, what is it with you and old people?

122
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:32,661
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come here. He'd be proud of you. You know he would.

00:12:56,352 --> 00:12:58,688
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

00:12:58,688 --> 00:13:01,857
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. I just need to pay for some gas.

129

00:16:05,274 --> 00:16:06,742
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well.

162
00:16:06,742 --> 00:16:10,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's to be bathed daily, his linens changed.

163
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:15,517
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't bother with the housework. I'm the only one that knows how.

166
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,594
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We came over from Savannah in '62.

167
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:28,731
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We bought this house from a brother and a sister.

168
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:32,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'd inherited it a long time ago, from their parents.

169
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:34,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lived here since they were children.

170

172
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:44,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they fell on hard times, had to sell.

173
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You keep their picture?

174
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:51,515
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. I like to pay my respects to the memories of this house.

175
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:03,610


176
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:08,659
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right. Come along now.

177
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:16,078
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the dining room.

178
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We only use about half of the rooms. The others are for Ben's antique business.

179
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:23,118
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What he couldn't sell, we stored here.

180
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:25,287
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Except for the attic.

181
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:27,423
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That has crystal and china.

182
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:32,586
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I keep a very close account on that, just so as you know.

183
00:17:34,296 --> 00:17:37,066
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are more than 30 rooms in all.

184
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:40,703
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In the old days, they made a separate key for each room.

185
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:44,873
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For the owner, they made a skeleton key.

186
00:17:44,873 --> 00:17:47,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This will open every door.

187
00:17:47,543 --> 00:17:50,479
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This one is yours.

188
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:53,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have mine.

189
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:55,284
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, the pantry's right out here.

190
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:59,154
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, we may have to ask you to go into town now and then.

191
00:17:59,154 --> 00:18:02,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was there a mirror here once?

192
00:18:03,592 --> 00:18:06,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I noticed in the bathrooms also there are no mirrors.

193
00:18:06,362 --> 00:18:09,531
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Child, when you get as worn-out and wrinkled as we are...

194
00:18:09,531 --> 00:18:11,367
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you don't need any reminding.

195
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:14,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you want a small one for your own purposes...that's fine with me.

196
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:19,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What'd you do with them? - Put them away.

197

00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:29,051
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I do smoke. I smoke a lot and I enjoy it very much.

199
00:18:29,051 --> 00:18:31,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I trust that won't be an issue. - It won't be.

200
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,323
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good. Then for the most part just realize that...

201
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:36,558
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll live here as if you're not in residence.

202
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:41,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After all, we're not kin. Are your parents still alive?

203
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,068
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My mom left when I was little. My dad raised me and he died last year.

204
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:50,696
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my. So you cared for him as well?

205
00:18:50,773 --> 00:18:56,373
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I would have. I just thought I had more time.

206
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,115
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

207
00:19:00,115 --> 00:19:03,886
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think too much about the time you have left...

208
00:19:03,886 --> 00:19:06,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you don't spend it living.

209
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:09,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be good to my husband. Be good to his house.

210
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,427
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remedies at 9:00.

211
00:19:11,427 --> 00:19:15,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One, two, three.

212
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:38,087
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't see gardens like this back in New Jersey, I expect.

213
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:40,989
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, it's the Garden State.

214
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:44,514
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}[Laughing] I doubt that very much.

215
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:47,362
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing more glorious than a garden.

216
00:19:47,362 --> 00:19:51,422
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gone every winter, back every spring.

217
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:56,438
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You religious at all?

218
00:19:56,438 --> 00:19:58,907
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I try to keep an open mind.

219
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:02,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's good. That's very good.

220
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,046
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are my trilliums?

221
00:20:04,046 --> 00:20:07,749
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, fiddlesticks. Do me a blessing, child.

222
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,718
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you run up to the attic for me?

223
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:14,949
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have some seed packets in a box right next to the stairs.

224
00:23:05,827 --> 00:23:08,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What took you?

225
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,999
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

226
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:13,835
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought the key opens everything.

227
00:23:13,835 --> 00:23:15,971
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The key? What key?

228
00:23:15,971 --> 00:23:18,006
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The key you gave me for the house.

229
00:23:18,006 --> 00:23:21,343
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's a door in the attic it doesn't work for.

230
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:25,247
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, the attic, it's never opened that.

231
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:29,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I got my Dixie-Johns. - Why not?

232
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:32,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's in there? - I have no idea.

233
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's been shut ever since we moved in.

234
00:23:34,856 --> 00:23:38,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have to get these in the ground, because there's rain coming.

235
00:23:38,894 --> 00:23:40,595
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Devereaux...

236
00:23:40,595 --> 00:23:45,656
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ben was in the attic, wasn't he, when he had his stroke?

237
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,706
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was he doing in there?

238
00:23:50,706 --> 00:23:54,142
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll have to ask him, child.

239
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:57,946
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be a dear and go see to him, won't you?

240
00:23:57,946 --> 00:24:01,676
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wonder if he wouldn't like some iced tea.

241
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:17,946
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His door was locked.

242
00:26:19,154 --> 00:26:21,746
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ben!

243
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:31,628
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ben!

244
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,829
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ben!

245
00:26:36,071 --> 00:26:41,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop right there, Ben! Don't move!

246
00:26:47,382 --> 00:26:50,008
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop!

247
00:26:50,051 --> 00:26:52,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ben!

248
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,948
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Devereaux!

249
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:06,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ben!

250
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:10,535
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ben, what are you doing? It's me!

251
00:27:11,706 --> 00:27:13,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mother of mercy, what's he done?

252
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:16,144
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He got out of the window. I thought you said he was bedridden.

253
00:27:16,144 --> 00:27:17,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}VIOLET: He's having spasms.

254
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:19,047
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Didn't you give him his remedies? - Yes.

255
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:21,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did you make sure he drank them down? - I thought so.

256
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,885
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Ben, what'd they make you do? - His door was locked.

257
00:27:23,885 --> 00:27:26,922
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just go get the wheelchair. We've gotta get him out of this.

258
00:27:26,922 --> 00:27:32,592
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What about a doctor? - In the morning, just get that wheelchair now.

259
00:27:39,976 --> 00:27:42,857


260
00:27:43,338 --> 00:27:46,135
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}VIOLET: Caroline!

261
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:55,173
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}VIOLET: Caroline!

262
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:58,019
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What in damnation took you so long?

263
00:27:58,019 --> 00:27:59,588
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I came as fast as I could.

264
00:27:59,588 --> 00:28:02,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're just gonna have to double his remedies. That's all I can think of.

265
00:28:02,991 --> 00:28:06,425
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Caroline, help me here. Help me get him.

266
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:13,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. That's it.

267
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:41,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where did you think you were going?

268
00:28:47,302 --> 00:28:51,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're here two days and he already tried to kill himself.

269
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:54,542
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Must have some kind of bedside manner, huh?

270
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:57,846
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of my many charms.

271
00:28:57,846 --> 00:28:59,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what exactly happened? I came to update her will...

272
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,719
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she's up with the doc, says he fell?

273
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:07,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He did fall.

274
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:10,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like what, from his wheelchair?

275
00:29:14,329 --> 00:29:18,066
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You cannot be serious. From up there? He fell from up there?

276
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:21,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How? He can't even walk.

277
00:29:21,836 --> 00:29:25,774
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please don't tell me you're quitting. I have to start over again.

278
00:29:25,774 --> 00:29:30,209
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you shut the door? I want to show you something.

279
00:29:30,578 --> 00:29:32,981
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what my mama used to say?

280
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:36,651
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If a lady invites you into her room, she probably isn't much of a lady.

281
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:41,322
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Homespun Southern wisdom grows on trees around here, doesn't it?

282
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:43,725
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found this in Ben's room...

283
00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:45,193
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}last night.

284
00:29:45,193 --> 00:29:47,095
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}LUKE: Found what? His laundry?

285
00:29:47,095 --> 00:29:48,797
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it had a...

286
00:29:48,797 --> 00:29:51,132
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CAROLINE: There was... LUKE: Had a what?

287
00:29:51,132 --> 00:29:54,759
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a... It had a...

288
00:29:55,637 --> 00:29:58,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forget it.

289
00:29:58,239 --> 00:29:59,908
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought it...

290
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:03,244
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what I thought.

291
00:30:03,244 --> 00:30:05,246
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I admire you.

292
00:30:05,246 --> 00:30:08,016
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, what you do.

293
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:10,418
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hell, I wouldn't be able to take care of my own parents.

294
00:30:10,418 --> 00:30:11,753
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'd regret it.

295
00:30:11,753 --> 00:30:15,724
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CAROLINE: I quit college to help out with some friends' bands.

296
00:30:15,724 --> 00:30:18,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Out all night, always on the road.

297
00:30:18,827 --> 00:30:22,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My father thought I was throwing my life away.

298
00:30:22,831 --> 00:30:27,702
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we didn't talk, didn't visit. Stubborn and proud, and that's how we left it.

299
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:29,804
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You mean...

300
00:30:29,804 --> 00:30:32,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

301
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:37,901
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was gone before I even knew he was sick.

302
00:30:41,616 --> 00:30:45,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I guess he wanted to spare me from all this.

303
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that so wrong?

304
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:53,023
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one should have to die alone.

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there was a banker here, his name was Thorpe.

410
00:43:41,328 --> 00:43:43,664
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He made his fortune cheating the poor.

411
00:43:43,664 --> 00:43:46,767
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was a mean man. He was a cruel man.

412
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:50,371
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was him, and his family, and couple of servants...

413
00:43:50,371 --> 00:43:55,543
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}name of Mama Cecile and Papa Justify.

414
00:43:55,543 --> 00:43:56,911
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sit down.

415
00:43:56,911 --> 00:44:03,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now...the way I heard it, old man Thorpe, he didn't know...

416
00:44:03,017 --> 00:44:07,054
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that Papa Justify was a "two-headed doctor."

417
00:44:07,054 --> 00:44:12,217
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was a conjure man. So was Cecile.

418
00:44:12,226 --> 00:44:15,853
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They believed in... - Hoodoo.

419
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:19,356
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah.

420
00:44:21,669 --> 00:44:24,966
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was their room.

421
00:44:28,576 --> 00:44:32,012
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}VIOLET: They were famous all through the bayous.

422
00:44:32,012 --> 00:44:35,416
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They healed the sick and they hurt the mean.

423
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:39,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Hit a straight lick with a crooked stick," as the coloreds say.

424
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,325
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But old Thorpe, he just saw them as help.

425
00:44:44,325 --> 00:44:47,194
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And he worked them to the bone.

426
00:44:47,194 --> 00:44:50,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He abused them.

427
00:44:50,064 --> 00:44:54,556
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Until one night, as the story goes...

428
00:44:55,002 --> 00:44:57,526
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}there was a party.

429
00:44:58,939 --> 00:45:03,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}VIOLET: It was the bank's anniversary, all the big mucketymucks were here.

430
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:07,314
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Politicians, sugar barons, riverboat tycoons.

431
00:45:07,314 --> 00:45:11,051
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a lot of drinking and dancing...

432
00:45:11,051 --> 00:45:15,019
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and a couple of trysts, I'm sure.

433
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:19,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then, finally, when it was time to say farewell...

434
00:45:19,393 --> 00:45:23,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}some of the guests wanted to wish goodbye to the children.

435
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:26,734
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But nobody could find them. They hadn't seen them in hours.

436
00:45:26,734 --> 00:45:32,006
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, being all full of brandy, they made it a game."Let's Find the Children. "

437
00:45:32,006 --> 00:45:35,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Room after room after room.

438
00:45:35,075 --> 00:45:37,978
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finally, someone heard music...

439
00:45:37,978 --> 00:45:39,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Martin? Grace?

440
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...and voices and shouting...

441
00:45:43,017 --> 00:45:44,685
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}up in the attic.

442
00:45:44,685 --> 00:45:47,709
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}[Record] From the devil's house.

443
00:45:47,755 --> 00:45:49,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}[Record] It is time, Lord.

444
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:52,559
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}VIOLET: The servants were up there with the children.

445
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:56,063
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were trying to teach them how to conjure hoodoo.

446
00:45:56,063 --> 00:45:59,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}MAN: And take his head.

447
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:04,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thorpe went about insane, and so did the rest of the guests.

448
00:46:05,139 --> 00:46:09,109
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, how long had this blasphemy been going on?

449
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:13,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The children said it was their fault, that they'd wanted to learn.

450
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they weren't having any of that.

451
00:46:38,072 --> 00:46:44,066
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All that power and rage and insanity.

452
00:46:52,419 --> 00:46:55,511
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The party was over.

453
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:10,571
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was a terrible thing.

454
00:47:10,571 --> 00:47:13,368
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Terrible.

455
00:47:16,043 --> 00:47:20,774
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rumors got out, but no arrests, no trial.

456
00:47:21,148 --> 00:47:24,343
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Money had its way.

457
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:28,155
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to the family?

458
00:47:28,155 --> 00:47:30,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The bank went under.

459
00:47:30,257 --> 00:47:35,853
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thorpe shot his wife to death, and then turned the gun on himself.

460
00:47:36,997 --> 00:47:41,301
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}People in the bayou say it was Justify and Cecile's revenge.

461
00:47:41,301 --> 00:47:45,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The children stayed here till '62.

462
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:51,239
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they never, ever, told us why that room was locked.

463
00:47:51,445 --> 00:47:56,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or why there were no mirrors in the whole house.

464
00:47:57,084 --> 00:47:58,919
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now we know.

465
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:01,943
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what?

466
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:07,188
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see them in the mirrors.

467
00:48:07,294 --> 00:48:08,662
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who?

468
00:48:08,662 --> 00:48:10,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The servants.

469
00:48:10,831 --> 00:48:13,967
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've gone and read some hoodoo books, and they say...

470
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:17,104
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Putting brick dust down'll keep harm away. - Mrs. Devereaux.

471
00:48:17,104 --> 00:48:20,073
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I made a big circle of it around the whole house.

472
00:48:20,073 --> 00:48:25,407
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't expect me to believe you see ghosts in your mirrors.

473
00:48:27,314 --> 00:48:30,805
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The ghosts are here now.

474
00:48:32,052 --> 00:48:35,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But whatever they did to him...

475
00:48:35,122 --> 00:48:39,284
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am not going to let them do it to me.

476
00:48:44,898 --> 00:48:48,161
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you'll leave...

477
00:48:48,268 --> 00:48:51,827
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}like all the rest of them.

478
00:49:50,731 --> 00:49:54,468
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's some superstitious wife you got there, Ben.

479
00:49:54,468 --> 00:49:58,171
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She thinks you have ghosts in the attic.

480
00:49:58,171 --> 00:50:00,374
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Spooky, huh?

481
00:50:00,374 --> 00:50:02,863
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ouch.

482
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:07,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on. I'll be right back.

483
00:50:22,396 --> 00:50:26,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She says you see them in the mirrors.

484
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ghosts in the mirrors.

485
00:51:04,905 --> 00:51:07,804
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Ben.

486
00:51:10,043 --> 00:51:13,033
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ben, stop it.

487
00:51:14,247 --> 00:51:17,617
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Relax. I'm so...

488
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:20,584
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry.

489
00:51:21,488 --> 00:51:24,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry.

490
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:28,453
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see them, too.

491
00:51:36,536 --> 00:51:38,505
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm going to town.

492
00:51:38,505 --> 00:51:40,607
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shopping.

493
00:51:40,607 --> 00:51:43,938
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}VIOLET: What for, Caroline?

494
00:51:45,278 --> 00:51:47,481
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Caroline, what for?

495
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:50,744
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll just have to see.

496
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,928
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}MAMA CYNTHIA: He won't beat you again.

497
00:52:34,928 --> 00:52:37,764
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CUSTOMER: Mama Cynthia, he beat me last night.

498
00:52:37,764 --> 00:52:41,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CYNTHIA: You use the potion that I'm gonna fix for you...

499
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:43,603
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and it won't happen again. I will promise you that.

500
00:52:43,603 --> 00:52:46,273
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CUSTOMER: I'm scared. CYNTHIA: Don't be afraid.

501
00:52:46,273 --> 00:52:47,808
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CUSTOMER: Are you sure that I can do it?

502
00:52:47,808 --> 00:52:49,443
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CYNTHIA: I know it will. It will work.

503
00:52:49,443 --> 00:52:51,912
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just do as I say. Don't be afraid.

504
00:52:51,912 --> 00:52:54,848
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It will work, and it won't happen again, ever.

505
00:52:54,848 --> 00:52:57,818
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry about it. He won't hit you again.

506
00:52:57,818 --> 00:53:02,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just use this potion I mixed up. I have a lot of things in here.

507
00:53:02,189 --> 00:53:04,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you use it as I told you.

508
00:53:04,157 --> 00:53:07,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Okay, I'll trust you, Mama. - You'll do fine.

509
00:53:14,534 --> 00:53:18,405
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That brick dust at the door, how does it work?

01:01:03,903 --> 01:01:06,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Caroline.

614
01:01:49,882 --> 01:01:52,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Devereaux?

615
01:02:16,909 --> 01:02:20,843
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Her and her ghost shit.

616
01:02:41,034 --> 01:02:43,636
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CAROLINE: That attic is filled with this stuff.

617
01:02:43,636 --> 01:02:46,973
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Recipes. Spells. Books of them. Records of them.

618
01:02:46,973 --> 01:02:49,942
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I understand your cause of concern...

619
01:02:49,942 --> 01:02:53,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but my family is superstitious, too. We're called Baptists.

620
01:02:53,613 --> 01:02:55,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is different. - It's charming.

621
01:02:55,615 --> 01:02:56,816
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Local color.

622
01:02:56,816 --> 01:02:59,752
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said yourself you were worried about him.

623
01:02:59,752 --> 01:03:03,856
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, now I'm worried about you. You know?

624
01:03:03,856 --> 01:03:06,846
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you a nurse or a detective?

625
01:03:09,328 --> 01:03:11,864
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When did you first meet the Devereauxs?

626
01:03:11,864 --> 01:03:13,633
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just before he had his stroke.

627
01:03:13,633 --> 01:03:15,902
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were looking for a lawyer to update their wills.

628
01:03:15,902 --> 01:03:18,304
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you ever think that maybe she knew something...

629
01:03:18,304 --> 01:03:25,211
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was gonna happen to him? How? Like tarot cards in the attic? A seance in her sleep?

630
01:03:25,211 --> 01:03:28,414
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I want to know why the last girl quit.

631
01:03:28,414 --> 01:03:32,218
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hallie. Some folks to see you.

632
01:03:32,218 --> 01:03:34,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}HALLIE: You a superstitious person?

633
01:03:34,487 --> 01:03:36,122
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CAROLINE: Not per se.

634
01:03:36,122 --> 01:03:37,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}HALLIE: I told my mama where I was working.

635
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:40,793
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said that house has been nothing but blood and tears.

636
01:03:40,793 --> 01:03:44,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That the last owners were some rich brother and sister.

637
01:03:44,397 --> 01:03:47,166
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Crazy people, supposedly.

638
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:50,403
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They died of strokes right after they sold the place.

639
01:03:50,403 --> 01:03:53,606
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe they found something they shouldn't.

640
01:03:53,606 --> 01:03:56,409
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe now Ben did, too.

641
01:03:56,409 --> 01:04:02,849
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It may be their mess in that room...but ain't no ghosts put a spell on that old man.

642
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:04,484
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She did.

643
01:04:04,484 --> 01:04:06,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Do you believe that? - Don't you?

644
01:04:06,786 --> 01:04:11,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I heard it can't hurt you. I mean, it can't hurt you if you don't believe.

645
01:04:11,958 --> 01:04:16,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I suggest you leave that house before you do.

646
01:04:19,332 --> 01:04:22,301
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}LUKE: For God's sake, this is insane. The man had a stroke.

647
01:04:22,301 --> 01:04:23,669
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CAROLINE: That isn't what he thinks.

648
01:04:23,669 --> 01:04:26,139
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you're gonna take him away from her? From his own wife?

649
01:04:26,139 --> 01:04:29,675
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How can you believe... - I don't believe. I don't.

650
01:04:29,675 --> 01:04:32,345
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The point is, he does.

651
01:04:32,345 --> 01:04:33,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop the car.

652
01:04:33,646 --> 01:04:35,281
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stop the car. - Why?

653
01:04:35,281 --> 01:04:40,512
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been here before. I'll show you. It's not just them.

654
01:04:46,492 --> 01:04:49,495
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See the line across the doorway? It's brick dust.

655
01:04:49,495 --> 01:04:51,631
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hoodoo. Keeps your enemies from coming across.

656
01:04:51,631 --> 01:04:55,001
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See the bones hanging? This stuff's got a hold on people out here.

657
01:04:55,001 --> 01:04:57,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, but it's not real.

658
01:04:57,770 --> 01:05:02,603
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't matter if it's not real. It's real to them.

659
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong?

660
01:05:06,879 --> 01:05:10,082
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This music. I know this music.

661
01:05:10,082 --> 01:05:13,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sure this is a good idea?

662
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:16,647
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello?

663
01:05:20,526 --> 01:05:24,017
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mama raised a gentleman.

664
01:05:26,399 --> 01:05:28,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CAROLINE: Hello?

665
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:31,261
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excuse me. Ma'am?

666
01:05:33,105 --> 01:05:35,508
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We heard the music, your record. I was wondering...

667
01:05:35,508 --> 01:05:39,476
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}WOMAN: There's no record for anyone here.

668
01:05:39,745 --> 01:05:45,181
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about records by a man named Justify?

669
01:05:48,087 --> 01:05:50,623
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you know that name?

670
01:05:50,623 --> 01:05:53,613
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who sent you?

671
01:05:55,461 --> 01:06:00,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who else is in here? Someone else in here? - It's just me, ma'am.

672
01:06:00,233 --> 01:06:02,168
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop now. Don't you go touching...

673
01:06:02,168 --> 01:06:06,603
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know a record called the Conjure of Sacrifice?

674
01:06:08,641 --> 01:06:11,477
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I have it, if you do.

675
01:06:11,477 --> 01:06:14,547
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You had that, you wouldn't say so.

676
01:06:14,547 --> 01:06:17,083
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You do know it.

677
01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:22,455
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The strongest conjuration of all. They say Justify discovered it...

678
01:06:22,455 --> 01:06:26,192
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but he got killed before he learned to work it.

679
01:06:26,192 --> 01:06:31,264
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Him and his poor wife both. It's never been found.

680
01:06:31,264 --> 01:06:32,765
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does it do?

681
01:06:32,765 --> 01:06:36,233
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It keeps you from dying. Not forever, but for a while.

682
01:06:38,838 --> 01:06:40,072
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How?

683
01:06:40,072 --> 01:06:47,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to sacrifice somebody...and take the years that they have left.

684
01:06:54,587 --> 01:07:00,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CAROLINE: Hurry up! He's alone with her! Hang on, Caroline! Wait! Shit!

685
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you got me spooked.

686
01:07:01,894 --> 01:07:04,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I get proof that she's out to hurt him, will you stick by me...

687
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:07,099
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- By "hurt him," you mean kill him. - Will you or won't you?

688
01:07:07,099 --> 01:07:08,868
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just listen to yourself.

689
01:07:08,868 --> 01:07:10,036
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fine. Goodbye.

690
01:07:10,036 --> 01:07:11,604
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you gonna do here, kidnap him?

691
01:07:11,604 --> 01:07:14,807
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know something's wrong between them. You know it.

692
01:07:14,807 --> 01:07:19,211
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me make some calls. See about grounds for...a restraining order, protective custody.

693
01:07:19,211 --> 01:07:21,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not gonna get a search warrant till tomorrow anyhow.

694
01:07:21,447 --> 01:07:24,608
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then that'll give me tonight.

695
01:07:24,717 --> 01:07:28,708
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm all he's got, Luke. Me.

696
01:07:29,021 --> 01:07:32,386
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get the proof. Okay?

697
01:07:39,699 --> 01:07:43,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Devereaux, I'm back.

698
01:08:08,627 --> 01:08:13,153
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. Where's the record?

699
01:08:13,866 --> 01:08:17,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was right here.

700
01:08:59,712 --> 01:09:04,045
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Devereaux, could you come here for a second?

701
01:09:04,817 --> 01:09:08,487
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Caroline, I was beginning to worry about you...you were gone such a long while.

702
01:09:08,487 --> 01:09:10,189
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CAROLINE: It's really raining out there.

703
01:09:10,189 --> 01:09:12,024
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}VIOLET: It's supposed to pour all night.

704
01:09:12,024 --> 01:09:14,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keeps up like this, that swamp's going to rise...

705
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:17,496
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and ruin my flowerbeds.

706
01:09:17,496 --> 01:09:19,565
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you want to see me?

707
01:09:19,565 --> 01:09:23,169
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, I was wondering if you could take a look at this? There's a leak up here.

708
01:09:23,169 --> 01:09:27,365
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're all over the house. They're just rainwater.

709
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:31,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, but if you look up close...

710
01:09:32,011 --> 01:09:36,344
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on in. I could show it to you better.

711
01:09:36,655 --> 01:09:38,858


712
01:09:45,825 --> 01:09:50,294
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, I have supper on the stove.

713
01:09:50,296 --> 01:09:52,231
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I shouldn't leave it.

714
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:55,701
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It'll just take a second. - I can see perfectly from here.

715
01:09:55,701 --> 01:09:58,337
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want this for the sill?

716
01:09:58,337 --> 01:10:01,168
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right.

717
01:10:02,174 --> 01:10:06,045
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Could you come into the room please, just for a second?

718
01:10:06,045 --> 01:10:10,013
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I can show you what I'm seeing.

719
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:17,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a funny one, Caroline.

720
01:10:19,325 --> 01:10:22,349
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll make us some tea.

721
01:10:27,933 --> 01:10:29,802
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, Caroline?

722
01:10:29,802 --> 01:10:32,371
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After you've given Mr. Devereaux his remedies...

723
01:10:32,371 --> 01:10:36,075
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}would you be so kind as to join an old lady for supper?

724
01:10:36,075 --> 01:10:37,243
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, l... - Wonderful!

725
01:10:37,243 --> 01:10:39,411
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We should have done it days ago.

726
01:10:39,411 --> 01:10:43,141
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've made something real nice.

727
01:10:53,826 --> 01:10:57,157
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're leaving tonight.

728
01:11:04,303 --> 01:11:07,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}VIOLET: Caroline!

729
01:11:07,506 --> 01:11:10,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Supper.

730
01:11:31,664 --> 01:11:33,832
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's your gumbo?

731
01:11:33,832 --> 01:11:35,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I haven't started.

732
01:11:35,401 --> 01:11:37,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you like sugar for your tea? I put it out for you.

733
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:40,306
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I don't think I'll have any sugar tonight.

734
01:11:40,306 --> 01:11:46,312
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I thought you liked it. You always have sugar in your tea.

735
01:11:46,312 --> 01:11:48,847
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think I'm senile, don't you?

736
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:51,483
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ghosts in the attic. Spells on my husband.

737
01:11:51,483 --> 01:11:53,786
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just don't understand.

738
01:11:53,786 --> 01:11:58,557
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These ghosts, why would they put a spell on him and not me? I've been in that room, too.

739
01:11:58,557 --> 01:12:01,627
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe because you don't believe in them.

740
01:12:01,627 --> 01:12:08,755
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe all houses have spirits...but we just don't see them until we believe we can.

741
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:14,629
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm really not that hungry.

742
01:12:15,674 --> 01:12:18,844
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't move. I'll fetch the candles.

743
01:12:18,844 --> 01:12:23,279
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Eat your gumbo. Oh, fiddlesticks.

744
01:12:43,102 --> 01:12:45,904
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dinner by candlelight.

745
01:12:45,904 --> 01:12:48,393
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There.

746
01:13:02,855 --> 01:13:06,525
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, was that the storm or the ghosts?

747
01:13:06,525 --> 01:13:08,927
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, say what you will about spirits.

748
01:13:08,927 --> 01:13:13,098
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've always wondered if there wasn't something...we could learn from them.

749
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:16,031
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like a spell?

750
01:13:17,202 --> 01:13:19,972
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have great respect for your husband.

751
01:13:19,972 --> 01:13:23,042
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And whatever he thinks happened to him, he's fighting it.

752
01:13:23,042 --> 01:13:25,077
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did happen to him, Violet?

753
01:13:25,077 --> 01:13:27,046
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You haven't touched your gumbo.

754
01:13:27,046 --> 01:13:28,147
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have you done to him?

755
01:13:28,147 --> 01:13:31,283
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I made that special for you, and you haven't even touched it.

756
01:13:31,283 --> 01:13:32,418
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What have you done?

757
01:13:32,418 --> 01:13:37,723
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is my husband, and I am his wife...and I will do to him whatever I wish to do!

758
01:13:37,723 --> 01:13:39,958
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not safe in this house.

759
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:41,894
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, what...

760
01:13:41,894 --> 01:13:43,762
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What is this?

761
01:13:43,762 --> 01:13:45,164
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've done something.

762
01:13:45,164 --> 01:13:47,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not safe in this house. Not with you.

763
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:52,591
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is my house. - I'm taking him, Violet. －No!

764
01:13:57,209 --> 01:14:00,245
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Too late. Not again.

765
01:14:00,245 --> 01:14:04,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You little whore. He's mine.

766
01:14:05,317 --> 01:14:11,256
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep him in this house. Keep him in this...

767
01:14:11,256 --> 01:14:14,121
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's mine!

768
01:14:17,696 --> 01:14:20,493
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Protection."

769
01:14:32,111 --> 01:14:35,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where's the record?

770
01:14:43,088 --> 01:14:45,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God.

771
01:14:50,629 --> 01:14:53,323
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got it.

772
01:14:57,169 --> 01:15:00,034
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You bitch.

773
01:15:09,581 --> 01:15:12,446
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Time to go.

774
01:15:26,398 --> 01:15:31,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Ben. I'm going to get you out of here. Just hold on.

775
01:15:56,261 --> 01:15:58,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Damn it!

776
01:15:58,730 --> 01:16:01,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep him in this house.

777
01:16:05,437 --> 01:16:08,165
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on.

778
01:16:23,188 --> 01:16:25,985
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Caroline?

779
01:16:36,935 --> 01:16:39,697
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, shit!

780
01:16:53,886 --> 01:16:56,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Caroline.

781
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:02,615
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Ben!

782
01:17:04,196 --> 01:17:06,924
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've got to hide you, Ben.

783
01:17:23,949 --> 01:17:28,179
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm gonna get help. I won't leave you.

784
01:17:29,621 --> 01:17:32,213
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay?

785
01:17:42,267 --> 01:17:45,064
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Caroline?

786
01:17:49,942 --> 01:17:53,412
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think you can take him out of this house?

787
01:17:53,412 --> 01:17:57,049
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You think you're stronger than me?

788
01:17:57,049 --> 01:18:01,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've no idea how strong I am, Caroline.

789
01:18:06,058 --> 01:18:08,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Caroline!

790
01:18:11,597 --> 01:18:16,089
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're just making it harder on yourself!

791
01:18:16,435 --> 01:18:19,459
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are you?

792
01:18:24,776 --> 01:18:28,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't get away, Caroline.

793
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:30,449
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You understand me?

794
01:18:30,449 --> 01:18:34,453
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll never get out of here, child.

795
01:18:34,453 --> 01:18:37,215
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Caroline?

796
01:18:39,024 --> 01:18:40,859
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Caroline!

797
01:18:40,859 --> 01:18:44,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop right there!

798
01:19:36,815 --> 01:19:39,577
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CAROLINE: Thank you.

799
01:19:42,788 --> 01:19:45,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Luke!

800
01:19:45,123 --> 01:19:48,113
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}LUKE: Jesus Christ.

801
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:52,698
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She tried to kill me.

802
01:19:52,698 --> 01:19:54,599
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She had a gun.

803
01:19:54,599 --> 01:20:01,106
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She knows I know. Ben's in trouble. He's still at the house. Call the police, Luke. I left him.

804
01:20:01,106 --> 01:20:02,874
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We got to get back out there.

805
01:20:02,874 --> 01:20:04,376
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The hell we do.

806
01:20:04,376 --> 01:20:07,145
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I left him there.

807
01:20:07,145 --> 01:20:10,282
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You didn't leave anyone. Okay? Slow down.

808
01:20:10,282 --> 01:20:14,683
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tell me what happened. She tried to kill you?

809
01:20:15,153 --> 01:20:17,813
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry.

810
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:19,991
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mrs. Devereaux.

811
01:20:19,991 --> 01:20:23,061
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To what do I owe the...

812
01:20:23,061 --> 01:20:27,265
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Heard from Caroline? Why would she have...

813
01:20:27,265 --> 01:20:30,323
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on?

814
01:20:31,203 --> 01:20:34,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. What happened tonight?

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe.

921
01:32:00,291 --> 01:32:03,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The frail. The weak.

922
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:06,027
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe.

923
01:32:06,597 --> 01:32:08,866
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't...

924
01:32:08,866 --> 01:32:11,355
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

925
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:15,635
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my God.

926
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:22,737
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe!

927
01:32:23,414 --> 01:32:25,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe!

928
01:32:25,650 --> 01:32:27,819
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe!

929
01:32:27,819 --> 01:32:30,809
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe!

930
01:33:56,274 --> 01:33:59,401
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, child.

931
01:34:08,019 --> 01:34:10,521
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cecile?

932
01:34:10,521 --> 01:34:13,545
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You all right?

933
01:34:13,724 --> 01:34:17,124
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm fine now, Justify.

934
01:34:18,629 --> 01:34:20,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A fair bit harder than the lawyer, wasn't she?

935
01:34:20,831 --> 01:34:23,601
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's harder every time.

936
01:34:23,601 --> 01:34:26,137
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They just don't believe like they used to.

937
01:34:26,137 --> 01:34:29,127
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Got to get them riled up.

938
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:36,447
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I told you I wanted a black one this time.

939
01:34:36,447 --> 01:34:40,051
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know the black ones never stay.

940
01:34:40,051 --> 01:34:43,054
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Beggars can't be choosers.

941
01:34:43,054 --> 01:34:46,123
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it fits you beautifully.

942
01:34:46,123 --> 01:34:50,751
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's better than Violet, or Grace, even.

943
01:34:51,495 --> 01:34:56,158
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll get used to it. We always do.

944
01:35:09,847 --> 01:35:14,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The thing folks don't understand about sacrifice...

945
01:35:14,785 --> 01:35:18,022
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}VIOLET: Get me out of here.

946
01:35:18,022 --> 01:35:20,191
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...sometimes it's more of a trade.

947
01:35:20,191 --> 01:35:23,454
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get me out of here.

948
01:35:24,362 --> 01:35:26,397
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

949
01:35:26,397 --> 01:35:29,831
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There, there, Caroline.

950
01:35:41,512 --> 01:35:46,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CAROLINE: We thought it was just a fall, but now she can't move or even speak.

951
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:47,685
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like a stroke or something.

952
01:35:47,685 --> 01:35:49,987
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}JILL: Cary?

953
01:35:49,987 --> 01:35:52,852
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}CAROLINE: Dearie me.

954
01:35:55,126 --> 01:35:59,527
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You called me. －I called you?

955
01:36:01,032 --> 01:36:04,201
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For help. Don't you remember?

956
01:36:04,201 --> 01:36:07,938
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cary's not herself right now. I'm Luke Marshall.

957
01:36:07,938 --> 01:36:11,609
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Devereauxs' lawyer. - Hi. Jill Dupay, her roommate.

958
01:36:11,609 --> 01:36:14,478
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jill, yes, I did call you.

959
01:36:14,478 --> 01:36:18,149
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fiddlesticks. I don't know what possessed me.

960
01:36:18,149 --> 01:36:21,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all right. I'm here.

961
01:36:21,819 --> 01:36:24,488
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They need real care now.

962
01:36:24,488 --> 01:36:26,257
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They can't stay here.

963
01:36:26,257 --> 01:36:28,125
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is all my fault.

964
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:30,761
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Cary. No, it's not.

965
01:36:30,761 --> 01:36:33,523
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not.

966
01:36:42,506 --> 01:36:46,777
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone should ride to the hospital with them. Maybe...

967
01:36:46,777 --> 01:36:51,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Jill, would you mind? And we'll meet you.

968
01:36:52,349 --> 01:36:55,646
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course. Whatever you need.

969
01:37:01,659 --> 01:37:06,597
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She meant so much to them, her being here.

970
01:37:06,597 --> 01:37:10,088
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know it wasn't for long, but...

971
01:37:10,201 --> 01:37:13,003
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}they really loved her.

972
01:37:13,003 --> 01:37:15,765
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you say that?

973
01:37:19,810 --> 01:37:22,313
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's in their wills.

974
01:37:22,313 --> 01:37:25,781
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They left her the house.

975
01:37:40,781 --> 01:37:59,781
