00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:54,783
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Do you have any idea what they were arguing about?

2
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:54,783
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你知道他们在争论什么吗?

3
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,418
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Do you speak English?

4
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,418
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你会说英语吗?

5
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:58,517
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah.

6
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:58,517
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}会

7
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:01,451
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}No. I'm sorry, my German is not very good.

8
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:01,451
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不过抱歉,我的德语不太好

9
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:08,362
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Have you heard that as couples age...

10
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:08,362
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你听说过年龄会导致夫妻间

11
00:04:08,362 --> 00:04:11,032
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...they lose their ability to hear each other?

12
00:04:08,362 --> 00:04:11,032
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}失去互相倾听的能力吗?

13
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:12,223
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}No.

14
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:12,223
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}没有

15
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:16,971
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Supposedly, men lose their ability to hear high-pitched sounds...

16
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:16,971
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}理论上男人会丧失听高音的能力...

17
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,164
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and women lose hearing in the low end.

18
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,164
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...而女人会丧失低音听力

19
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:21,974
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I guess they nullify each other.

20
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:21,974
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这是一种相互抵制

21
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,341
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I guess. Nature's way of allowing couples to grow old together...

22
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,341
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我想是的,自然法则是让夫妻白头偕老...

23
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:27,413
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...without killing each other.

24
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:27,413
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...而不是互相残杀

25
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:30,917
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What are you reading?

26
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:30,917
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你在看什么书?

27
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:33,285
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Oh, yeah.

00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:56,234
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I was thinking about going to the lounge car.

32
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:56,234
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我打算去休息室

33
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:59,480
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Would you like to come with me? -Yeah.

34
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:59,480
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-你愿意和我一起去吗?

38
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:23,195
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你的英语怎么说得这么好?

39
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,068
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I went to school for a summer in Los Angeles.

40
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,068
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我在洛杉矶上过一个暑期班

41
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:28,839

00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,189
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And you don't speak any other language, right?

54
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,189
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}而且你不会说任何其他语言,是吗?

57
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:53,062
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'm the crude, dumb, vulgar American...

00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:58,002
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...不会说其他语言,没有自己的文化, 但我尝试过

61
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:01,836
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I took French in high school. When I first got to Paris...

00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:04,410
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...I stood in line at the metro station.

64
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:04,410
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...在地铁站排队时

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I was practicing.

66
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,808
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}一直练习--(法语)

00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:18,251
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And I get up there, and I look at this woman...

70

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}轮到我时,我看着那个售票员...

71
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:23,398
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and my mind goes blank. And I say, "I need a ticket to get to...."

72
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:23,398
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...脑子一片空白,然后我说 "我要一张票去..."

103
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:10,440
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I've just been traveling around, riding trains for two or three weeks.

104
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:10,440
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我只是四处旅行,坐了两三个星期的火车

105
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:13,547
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You were visiting friends or just on your own?

106
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:13,547
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是去拜访朋友还是纯粹的旅行?

107
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:16,274
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I had a friend in Madrid, but....

108
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:16,274
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我有个朋友在马德里,不过...

109
00:07:16,485 --> 00:07:19,010
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Madrid, that's nice. -I got a Eurail pass...

110
00:07:16,485 --> 00:07:19,010
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-马德里,那儿很漂亮 -我有张全欧火车优惠票...

111
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:20,313
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...is what I did.

112
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:20,313
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...就是这样

113
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,649
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}hat's great.

114
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,649
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不错的理由

115
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:26,427
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So has this trip around Europe been good for you?

116
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:26,427
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那这次环欧旅行对你有帮助吗?

117
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:29,530
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, sure. It's been.... It sucked.

118
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:29,530
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是的,当然,它...它很有快感

119
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,427
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What?

120
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,427
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}什么?

121
00:07:33,502 --> 00:07:34,526
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's had its....

122
00:07:33,502 --> 00:07:34,526
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}它有它的...

123
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:38,373
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'll tell you, sitting for weeks on end looking out the window...

124
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:38,373
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这么说吧,坐上几个礼拜来看窗外的景色...

125
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:40,838
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...has actually been kind of great.

126
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:40,838
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...感觉的确很不错

127
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:43,869
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What do you mean?

128
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:43,869
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你是指什么?

129
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:46,815
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Well, you know, for instance...

130
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:46,815
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你知道的,比如说...

131
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:50,452
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...you have ideas that you ordinarily wouldn't have.

132
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:50,452
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...会想到一些平时想不到的想法

133
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,678
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-What kind of ideas? -Want to hear one?

134
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,678
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-什么想法? -想听一个吗?

135
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:54,879
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Tell me. -All right.

136
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:54,879
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-说说看 -好的

137
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:58,026
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I have this idea, okay, for a television show.

138
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:58,026
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我有这个想法是因为一个电视节目

139
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,923
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Some friends of mine are cable-access producers.

140
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,923
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我有个朋友是"享受电视"栏目的制作人

141
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,722
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Do you know what that is?

142
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,722
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}知道它的运作方式吗?

143
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,966
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Anybody can produce a show real cheap, and they have to put it on.

144
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,966
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他们播放任何人制作的低成本节目

145
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,334
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I have this idea for a show that lasts 24 hours a day for a year straight.

146
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,334
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我的想法是 让一个节目24小时播放并持续一年

147
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,769
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What you do is you get...

148
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,769
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你要做的就是找到...

149
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:18,310
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...365 people from cities all over the world...

150
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:18,310
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...来自世界各地不同城市的365个人...

151
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:21,506
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...to do these 24-hour documents of real time.

152
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:21,506
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...为每个人拍一部24小时的生活纪录片

153
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:24,311
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Capturing life as it's lived.

154
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:24,311
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}捕捉真实的生活画面

155
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,479
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You know, it would start with a guy waking up in the morning...

156
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,479
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}知道吗,可以从一个人早上起床开始...

157
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:30,716
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and taking the long shower...

158
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:30,716
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...舒舒服服洗个澡...

159
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:34,657
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...eating a little breakfast, making a little coffee...

160
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:34,657
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...吃点早餐,喝点咖啡...

161
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:35,990
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...reading the paper....

162
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:35,990
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...看看报纸...

163
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:38,257
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Wait. All those mundane, boring things...

164
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:38,257
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}等一下,全都是大家见鬼的生活中

165
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:41,493
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...everybody has to do every day of their fucking life?

166
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:41,493
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}每天那些平淡无聊的琐事吗?

167
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:43,797
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I was going to say, "The poetry of day-to-day life."

168
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:43,797
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是"诗意的日复一日的生活"

169
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:46,497
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You say it your way. I'll say it my way.

170
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:46,497
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你有你的说法,我有我的说法

171
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,700
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Think of it like this-- -Who's gonna watch?

172
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,700
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-可以这样想-- -有谁会看呢?

173
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:53,041
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Think about it like this. Why is it that a dog sleeping in the sun...

174
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:53,041
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}可以这样想,一只狗在太阳底下睡觉...

175
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,907
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...is so beautiful? It is. It's beautiful.

176
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,907
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...画面很美是不是?是的,确实很美

177
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,712
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But a guy taking money from a bank machine...

178
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,712
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但一个人从提款机取钱...

179
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,946
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...looks like a complete moron?

180
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,946
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...为什么就显得无聊了呢?

181
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:05,355
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So it's like a National GEographic program, but on people.

182
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:05,355
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这就象国家地理杂志的节目,只不过拍的是人

183
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:06,391
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah.

184
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:06,391
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}正是

185
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,428
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What do you think?

186
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,428
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}觉得怎么样?

187
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,499
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, I can see it. Like, 24 boring hours-- Sorry--

188
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,499
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是的,我明白, 就象,"无聊24小时"--对不起--

189
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:16,159
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and a three-minute sex scene where he falls asleep right after.

190
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:16,159
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...在一段3分钟的性交场面之后主角就睡着了

191
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:20,407
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, and that would be a great episode.

192
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:20,407
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}对啊,那会是一段很不错的情节

193
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:23,009
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}People would talk about that episode.

194
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:23,009
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}人们会谈论这段情节

195
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,080
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You and your friends could do one in Paris if you wanted.

196
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,080
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}如果愿意的话你可以和朋友在巴黎拍上一集

197
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:32,084
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I don't know. The key, the thing that haunts me is the distribution.

198
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:32,084
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我不知道,关键是地理分布问题让我头疼

199
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:36,224
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Getting these tapes from town to town so it would play continuously.

200
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:36,224
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}要一个城镇接一个城镇地拍摄 以保证它的持续性

201
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:41,089
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Because it would have to play all the time, or it just wouldn't work.

202
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:41,089
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}因为它必须不停地播放,否则就没有意义了

203
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:43,262
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Thank you.

204
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:43,262
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}谢谢

205
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,892
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Thanks.

206
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,892
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}谢谢

207
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:50,571
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You know what? Not service oriented.

208
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:50,571
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}知道吗?没有"服务指南"

209
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:54,540
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Just an observation about Europe.

210
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:54,540
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}只是一份"欧洲观察"

211
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:05,751
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}My parents never really spoke of the possibility...

212
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:05,751
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我父母从没真正谈论过

213
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:09,516
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...of my falling in love or getting married or having children.

214
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:09,516
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我会恋爱结婚生孩子的可能性

215
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,857
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Even as a little girl...

216
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,857
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}甚至我还是小女孩时...

217
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:15,519
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...they wanted me to think as a future career as a, you know...

218
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:15,519
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...他们就要我考虑未来的职业,例如...

219
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:18,928
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...interior designer or lawyer or something like that.

220
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:18,928
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...室内设计,律师或诸如此类

221
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:21,933
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'd say to my dad, "l want to be a writer."

222
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:21,933
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我对我爸爸说我想以写作为业

223
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:23,867
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And he'd say, "Journalist."

224
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:23,867
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他就说做记者

225
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:28,601
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'd say I wanted to have a refuge for stray cats. He'd say, "veterinarian."

226
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:28,601
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我说想开个流浪猫收容所,他就说做兽医

227
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:32,440
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'd say I wanted to be an actress. He'd say, "TV newscaster."

228
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:32,440
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我说想做演艺工作,他就说做电视播音员

229
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:36,641
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It was this constant conversion of my fanciful ambition into these...

230
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:36,641
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这使得我的理想抱负慢慢转变成了...

231
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:39,184
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...practical moneymaking ventures.

232
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:39,184
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...现实的赚钱手段

233
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,018
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I had a good bullshit detector when I was a kid.

234
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,018
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我很小时就善于洞察谎言

235
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,717
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I always knew when they were lying to me.

236
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,717
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}当别人说谎时我总是能知道

237
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:48,954
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}By high school, I was dead set...

238
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:48,954
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}到了高中,我决定...

239
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:53,363
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...on listening to what everybody thought I should do with my life...

240
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:53,363
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...听听大家认为我这辈子该做什么...

241
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,366
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and doing the opposite.

242
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,366
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...然后反其道而行之

243
00:10:56,472 --> 00:11:01,136
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Nobody was ever mean about it. I just could never get very excited...

244
00:10:56,472 --> 00:11:01,136
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}没有谁会当真, 我只是不喜欢

245
00:11:01,343 --> 00:11:04,506
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...about other people's ambitions for my life.

246
00:11:01,343 --> 00:11:04,506
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}别人将想法强加在我头上

247
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,744
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But you know what? If your parents never...

248
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,744
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但你知道吗?如果父母从不...

249
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,613
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...fully contradict you about anything and are nice and supportive...

250
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,613
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...在任何事上完全否定你, 而是友好地给予支持...

251
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,809
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Right.

252
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,809
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}嗯。

253
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:16,119
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...it makes it even harder to officially complain.

254
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:16,119
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...那会让你很难抱怨

255
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:20,193
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Even when they're wrong, it's this passive-aggressive shit.

256
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:20,193
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}哪怕他们做得并不对, 这是一种被动攻击

257
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:21,795
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You know what I mean?

258
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:21,795
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你明白吗?

259
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:23,259
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I hate it.

260
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:23,259
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我讨厌这样

261
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,258
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I really hate it.

262
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,258
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}非常反感

263
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:29,267
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Well, you know, despite all that kind of bullshit...

264
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:29,267
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}知道吗,尽管这种种不快...

265
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,132
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...that comes along with it...

266
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,132
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...总是会随之而来

267
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:34,505
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...I remember childhood as...

268
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:34,505
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...但我记得童年就象...

269
00:11:35,377 --> 00:11:37,402
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...this magical time.

270
00:11:35,377 --> 00:11:37,402
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...一段魔幻时光

271
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:42,550
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I do. I remember when my mother first told me about death.

272
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:42,550
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}真的, 记得我妈妈第一次跟我说到死亡

273
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:47,517
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}My great-grandmother had died, and my family had visited them in Florida.

274
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:47,517
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我的曾祖母去世,我们全家去弗罗里达奔丧

275
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,782
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I was about 3, 3 1/2 years old.

276
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,782
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}当时我才3岁或3岁半

277
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,426
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Anyway, I was in the back yard playing...

278
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,426
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我在后院玩耍时...

279
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,224
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and my sister had just taught me how to take the garden hose...

280
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,224
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...姐姐教我怎样拿浇花的水管...

281
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:59,594
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and do it in such a way that...

282
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:59,594
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...就是象这样子捏着...

283
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:03,564
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...it sprayed into the sun and would make a rainbow.

284
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:03,564
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...喷出的水雾会在阳光下形成一道彩虹

285
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,939
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And so I was doing that...

286
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:06,939
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}于是我那样做...

287
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:10,304
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and through the mist, I could see my grandmother.

288
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:10,304
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...透过水雾,我看到了曾祖母

289
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:13,811
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And she was just standing there, smiling at me.

290
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:13,811
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}她就站在那,冲着我微笑

291
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:17,179
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And I held it there for a long time...

292
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:17,179
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我愣在那很长时间

293
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:19,183
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and I looked at her.

294
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:19,183
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...并且看着她

295
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:22,653
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And then finally, I let go of the nozzle, you know?

296
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:22,653
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}最终我松开了喷嘴

297
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:24,826
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And then I dropped the hose...

298
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:24,826
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}然后扔下水管...

299
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:26,754
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and she disappeared.

300
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:26,754
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...她就消失了

301
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,325
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And so I run back inside and tell my parents.

302
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,325
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}于是我跑回屋里告诉父母

303
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:35,035
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And they sit me down and give me this big rap on how...

304
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:35,035
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他们让我坐下,然后训斥了我一顿...

305
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:40,331
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...when people die, you never see them again, and how I'd imagined it.

306
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:40,331
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...人死了之后你绝不可能再见到他们, 那只是我的幻觉

307
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:43,067
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But I knew what I'd seen. I was glad I saw that.

308
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:43,067
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但我知道我看到了什么,并且为之高兴

309
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,238
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I've never seen anything like that since. But I don't know.

310
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,238
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我以后绝不会再看到类似的情景, 但我不知道

311
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:51,510
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It just kind of let me know how ambiguous everything was.

312
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:51,510
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那让我有点明白世事都是那么无法解释

313
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,153
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Even death.

314
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,153
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}包括死亡

315
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,821
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You're lucky you can have this attitude toward death.

316
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,821
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你该庆幸你能这样看待死亡

317
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:02,693
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I think I'm afraid of death 24 hours a day.

318
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:02,693
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我想我时刻都在害怕死亡

319
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:06,334
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I swear. I mean, that's why I'm in a train right now.

320
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:06,334
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}真的,所以我才会坐火车

321
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,197
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I could've flown to Paris, but I'm scared.

322
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,197
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我可以乘飞机去巴黎,但我害怕

323
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:11,703
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Oh, come on. -I can't help it.

324
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:11,703
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-不会吧 -我控制不了

325
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:15,308
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I know the statistics say, "Na, na, na, it's safer." Whatever.

326
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:15,308
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我知道统计显示"不,不,不,它很安全"

327
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:18,639
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}When I'm in a plane, I can see the explosion.

328
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:18,639
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但我乘飞机时就会看到爆炸

329
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:21,145
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I can see me falling through the clouds.

330
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:21,145
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我看到我从云端坠落

331
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,616
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And I'm so scared of those few seconds of consciousness...

332
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,616
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我非常害怕那几秒钟的意识...

333
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:29,223
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...before you die. When you know you're gonna die.

334
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:29,223
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...在临死之前, 你知道自己快要死了的时候

335
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:34,426
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I can't stop thinking that way.

336
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:34,426
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我总忍不住会这样想

337
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,063
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's exhausting.

338
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,063
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那让人筋疲力竭

339
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:37,823
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, I bet.

340
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:37,823
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是的,没错

341
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:39,830
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Really exhausting.

342
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:39,830
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}真的筋疲力竭

343
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:46,206
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-I think this is vienna. -Yeah.

344
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:46,206
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-我想这是维也纳了 -是的

345
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,242
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-You get off here, no? -Yeah, what a drag.

346
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,242
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-你在这下,是吗? -是的,真扫兴

347
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:54,149
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I wish I'd met you earlier. I really like talking to you.

348
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:54,149
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}早认识你就好了,我很喜欢和你聊天

349
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:56,681
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, me too.

350
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:56,681
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我也是

351
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:59,614
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It was really nice of you too.

352
00:13:57,453 --> 00:13:59,614
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}很高兴能认识你

353
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,719
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I have an admittedly insane idea, but if I don't ask you this...

354
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,719
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我有个无疑是疯狂的想法, 但要是不问你的话...

355
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:36,948
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...it'll haunt me the rest of my life.

356
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:36,948
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...我下半辈子都会耿耿于怀的

357
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:37,887
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What?

358
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:37,887
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是什么?

359
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:45,862
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I want to keep talking to you. I have no idea what your situation is...

360
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:45,862
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我想继续跟你聊天, 尽管我对你一无所知...

361
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:48,802
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...but I feel like we have some kind of...

362
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:48,802
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...但我觉得我们似乎...

363
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:50,437
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...connection. Right?

364
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:50,437
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}似曾相识,同意吗?

365
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:51,798
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah. Me too.

366
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:51,798
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是的,我同意

367
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:54,039
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Right. Great. Here's the deal.

368
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:54,039
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那就好,是这样

369
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:57,644
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Get off here in vienna and come check out the town.

370
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:57,644
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}跟我一起下车游览维也纳

371
00:14:57,846 --> 00:14:59,507
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-What? -Come on. It'll be fun.

372
00:14:57,846 --> 00:14:59,507
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-什么? -来吧,肯定很有意思

373
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:01,644
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Come on. -What would we do?

374
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:01,644
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-来吧 -我们做些什么?

375
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,446
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I don't know. All I know is I catch a flight tomorrow morning at 9:30...

376
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,446
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不知道,我只知道我的飞机是明早9:30

377
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:10,022
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and I can't afford a hotel, so I was going to walk around...

378
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:10,022
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...而且我没钱住旅馆了, 所以只好到处走走...

379
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:12,090
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and it'd be more fun if you came with me.

380
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:12,090
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...如果你和我同行会更有意思

381
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:16,025
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And if I turn out to be a psycho, just get on the next train.

382
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:16,025
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}如果你觉得我不正常, 你可以改乘下一班火车

383
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,463
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}All right, all right. Think of it like this.

384
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,463
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}好吧,好吧,设想一下

385
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:23,564
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Jump ahead 10, 20 years, okay?

386
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:23,564
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}10年20年之后,懂吗?

387
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:24,932
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And you're married.

388
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:24,932
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你结婚之后

389
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,974
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Only your marriage doesn't have that same energy it used to have.

390
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,974
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你的婚姻失去了曾经有过的活力

391
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:31,174
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You start to blame your husband.

392
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:31,174
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你开始责备你的丈夫

393
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,315
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You think about all those guys you've met in your life...

394
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,315
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你回想你一生中曾遇见过的所有男人...

395
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,179
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and what might've happened if you'd picked up with one of them.

396
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,179
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...设想嫁给他们中的一个会发生什么

397
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:40,378
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'm one of those guys. That's me.

398
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:40,378
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我就是其中之一,就是我

00:18:58,487 --> 00:19:01,012
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Perhaps you can go to the Prater before the play.

500
00:18:58,487 --> 00:19:01,012
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你们可以在开演之前先去普拉特

501
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,056
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It starts at 2130.

502
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,056
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}演出是21:30开始

503
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:06,552
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-2130? -It's at 9:30.

504
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:06,552

00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,725
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What's the name of this play?

508
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,725
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这场戏叫什么?

509
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:15,028

510
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:15,028
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}翻译过来就是"带给我威尔明顿的母牛角"

511
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,329
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'm Wilmington's cow.

516
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:19,599
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-你们会来吗? -尽量吧

517
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:21,605

522
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:45,862

523
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:48,730
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's Q and A time. We've known each other a little while.

524
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:48,730
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是个问答游戏,我们已经互相有所了解

525
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,930
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}We're stuck together, so we'll ask each other a few direct questions.

526
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,930
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们是同伴了, 所以可以相互问几个直接的问题

527
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,266
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}All right?

528

529
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:58,545
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-We ask each other questions? -And you have to answer honestly.

530
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:58,545
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-我们互相提问? -但你必须老实回答

531

00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:02,513
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}All right, first question.

534
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:02,513
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}好的,第一个问题

536

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-你问 -是的,我要求你...

537

00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:14,393
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}My first sexual feelings? Oh, my God.

542
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:14,393
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我第一次的感觉?我的天

543

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I know. I know.

544
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:18,060
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我知道,我知道

545
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,262

00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,295
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Jean-Marc Fleury.

547
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:22,663
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Jean-Marc Fleury?

548
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:22,663
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}让-马克-弗勒里?

549
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,904
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}We were at this summer camp together, and he was a swimmer.

550
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,904
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们一起参加夏令营,他是个游泳运动员

551
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:30,511
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He had bleached-out chlorine hair and green eyes...

552
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:30,511
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}有一头被氯漂白的头发和绿眼睛

553
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:33,977
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and to improve his times, he'd shave his legs and arms.

554
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:33,977
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}为了提高成绩他刮掉了腿上和手臂上的毛

555
00:20:34,182 --> 00:20:37,618
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-That's disgusting. -He was like this gorgeous dolphin.

556
00:20:34,182 --> 00:20:37,618
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-真恶心 -就象只光洁的海豚

557
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,049
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}My friend Emma had a big crush on him.

558
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,049
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我的朋友艾玛对他很着迷

559
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:43,691
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So one day, I was cutting across the field back to my room...

560
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:43,691
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}有一天,我穿过营地回我的房间

561
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:46,622
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and he came walking up beside me. I told him...

562
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:46,622
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他走到我身边,我告诉他

563
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,229
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}..."You should date Emma. She has a big crush on you."

564
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,229
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}"你该和艾玛约会,她对你很着迷"

565
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:51,990
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And he turned to me and said...

566
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:51,990
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但他转过身对我说

567
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,068
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}..."Well, that's too bad, because I have a big crush on you."

568
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,068
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}"那太糟了,因为我对你很着迷"

569
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:59,434
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So, yeah, it really scared the hell out of me...

570
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:59,434
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是的,那真让我感到意外

571
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:01,836
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...because I thought he was so fine.

572
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:01,836
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...因为我觉得他太优秀

573
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:07,014
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Then he officially asked me on a date. I pretended I didn't like him.

574
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:07,014
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}然后他正式向我提出约会,我假装不喜欢他

575
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:12,553
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You know, I was so afraid of what I might do, you know.

576
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:12,553
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}要知道我很害怕自己可能做的事

577
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:17,658
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So I went to see him swim a few times at the competition.

578
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:17,658
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我去看了几次他的游泳比赛

579
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,885
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And he was so sexy. Really. I mean, really sexy.

580
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,885
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他很性感,真的,我是说非常性感

581
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:25,590
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}We wrote these little declarations of love at the end of the summer...

582
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:25,590
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那个夏季末我们写下了一些爱的宣言

583
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:29,202
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and, you know, promised we would keep writing forever...

584
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:29,202
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们保证要一直通信

585
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:31,668
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and meet again very soon and--

586
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:31,668
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}还有要尽快再见面

587
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,931
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Did you?

588
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,931
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}见了吗?

589
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:34,639
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Of course not.

590
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:34,639
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}当然没有

591
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:39,706
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Then this is the opportune time to tell you I'm a fantastic swimmer.

592
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:39,706
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我可以告诉你我是个非常棒的游泳选手

593
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,512
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Really? -Yeah.

594
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,512

00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,750
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-I make note of that. -Okay.

596

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}下一个问题

607
00:21:57,365 --> 00:21:58,923

00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:01,500
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-So I can give one-word answers? -Why not?

610
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:01,500
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-一个字就算是回答? -怎么不算?

611
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:04,570
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}After I went into detail about my sexual feelings?

612
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:04,570
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我可是详细描述过我初次的性经验

613
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:09,233
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}They' re different questions. I could answer the sexual-feelings thing.

614
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:09,233
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}因为问题不同,我可以回答性体验的事

615
00:22:09,444 --> 00:22:13,141
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But, you know, love-- I mean, what if I asked you about love?

616
00:22:09,444 --> 00:22:13,141

617
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:17,114
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I would have lied, but at least I would have made up a great story.

618
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:17,114
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我会说假话, 但我至少会编造一个美妙的故事

619
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,913
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Love is a complex issue, you know?

620
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,913
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}爱是个复杂的问题,明白吗?

621
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:24,854
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I mean, yes, I've told somebody that I love them, and I've meant it.

622
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:24,854
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我想是的, 我告诉过一些人我爱他们,而且我是认真的

623
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,291
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But was it totally unselfish, giving love?

624
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,291
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但爱是完全无私的付出吗?

625
00:22:28,496 --> 00:22:30,396
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Was it a beautiful thing?

626
00:22:28,496 --> 00:22:30,396
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}爱是一件美好的事吗?

627
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,659
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Not really. You know, it's like, love....

628
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,659
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不完全是,它就象,爱...

629
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,066
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I mean, I don't know.

630
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,066
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我想我无法说清

631

00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:42,402
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Yeah. I know what you mean. -But as far as sexual feelings go...

634
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:42,402
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-是的,我明白你的意思 -至于性体验...

635

00:22:51,653 --> 00:22:54,178
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You don't know Crystal? Well, I knew Crystal.

642
00:22:51,653 --> 00:22:54,178

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...you know, to smile to make them feel better about their boring life.

656
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:18,309
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...你知道的, 笑脸让他们觉得生活不那么无聊

00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:27,582
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...people are dying, and nobody knows what to do.

00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:27,582
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...人们在死亡,但没人知道该怎么做

666
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:30,087
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}也许根本不在乎,我说不清

667
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:33,921
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I hate that the media's trying to control our minds.

00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:39,491
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's very subtle, but it's a new form of fascism, really.

672
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:39,491
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}很难形容,是一种新的法西斯主义

673

676
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:46,965
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我讨厌身处异国,尤其是美国

677
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:51,737
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...each time I wear black or lose my temper or say anything about anything...

678
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:51,737
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...每当我穿黑衣服或是发脾气, 说不着边际的话...

679
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:55,212
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...they always go, "Oh, it's so French. It's so cute."

680
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:55,212
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...他们总是说, 哦,法国味十足,真有趣...

681
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:58,784
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I hate that. I can't stand that. Really.

682
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:58,784
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我讨厌这些,无法忍受,真的

683
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:00,912
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Is that all?

684
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:00,912
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}就这些?

685
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,680
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Well, there's a lot of things, but....

686
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,680
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}还有很多,不过...

687
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:06,360
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-So it's my turn. -Okay.

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-轮到我问了 -好的

689
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:08,891
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-You're gonna answer. -Yes, I'll answer.

690
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:08,891
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-你得回答 -是的,我会回答

00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:10,826
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What's a problem for you?

692
00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:10,826
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}什么会让你困惑呢?

00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:12,864
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}也许就是你

695
00:24:13,134 --> 00:24:14,123
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What?

696
00:24:13,134 --> 00:24:14,123
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}什么?

697
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,869
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I had a thought the other day that kind of...

698
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,869
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}有天我有过一个想法...

699
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:19,870
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...qualifies as a problem.

700
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:19,870
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...那确实让我困惑

701
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:21,199
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What is it?

702
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:21,199
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是什么?

703
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:24,378
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It was a thought I had on the train, so....

704
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:24,378
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是我在火车上想到的

705
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:26,240
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Okay. All right.

706
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:26,240
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这么说吧

707
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:28,312
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Do you believe in reincarnation?

708
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:28,312
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你相信轮回转世吗?

709
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,541
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting.

710
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,541
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是的,那很有意思

711
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:34,983
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}A lot of people talk about past lives and things like that, you know?

712
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:34,983
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}很多人都谈论前世这一类的话题

713
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,648
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And even if they don't believe in it in some specific way...

714
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,648
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}哪怕在特定的场合他们并不相信这一点...

715
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,158
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...people have a notion of an eternal soul.

716
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,158
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...人们相信灵魂是永存的

717
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:42,261
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Yeah. -Okay.

718
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:42,261
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-是的 -那好

719
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:44,955
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}This is my thought: 50,000 years ago...

720
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:44,955
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我的想法是,5万年前

721
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:47,134
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...there's not even a million people.

722
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:47,134
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...人口还不足100万

723
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:51,169
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Ten thousand years ago, there's, like, two million people.

724
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:51,169
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}1万年前有大约200万人口

725
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:55,332
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Now there's between five and six billion people on the planet.

726
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:55,332
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}而现在世界上有50到60亿人口

727
00:24:55,543 --> 00:24:57,067
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}If we all have our own...

728
00:24:55,543 --> 00:24:57,067
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}如果我们都有属于自己的...

729
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:59,178
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...individual, unique...

730
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:59,178
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...独立的，特别的...

731
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:00,345
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...soul...

732
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:00,345
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...灵魂...

733
00:25:00,782 --> 00:25:02,579
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...where did they all come from?

734
00:25:00,782 --> 00:25:02,579
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...那他们是从何而来的呢?

735
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:06,379
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Are modern souls only a fraction of the original souls?

736
00:25:02,784 --> 00:25:06,379
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}现代人的灵魂只是原有灵魂的一部分吗?

737
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:10,581
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}If they are, that represents a 5000 to 1 split of each soul...

738
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:10,581
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}如果是的话, 就表示每个灵魂在过去5万年...

739
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:14,523
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...in the last 50,000 years, which is a blip in the Earth's time.

740
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:14,523
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...分裂成了5000个, 对地球而言只是一瞬间

741
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:17,994
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So at best, we're these tiny fractions...

742
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:17,994
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们最多只是 人类史上...

743
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:19,663
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...of people walking--

744
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:19,663
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...微不足道的一部分

745
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:24,202
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Is that why we're so scattered? Is that why we're so specialized?

746
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:24,202
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}所以我们才这么分散? 所以我们才这么独特?

747
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:25,964
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Wait a minute, I'm not sure--

748
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:25,964
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}等等,我不太--

749
00:25:26,174 --> 00:25:29,632
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, I know, I know. It's a totally scattered thought.

750
00:25:26,174 --> 00:25:29,632
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是的,我知道, 这完全是不着边际的想法

751
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:32,772
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Which is kind of why it makes sense.

752
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:32,772
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不过这样才有点意义

753
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:35,145
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I agree with you.

754
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:35,145
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我同意

755
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:38,284
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Let's get off this damn train.

756
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:38,284
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们还是下车吧

757
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:15,683
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}This place is pretty neat.

758
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:15,683
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这里很不错

759
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,879
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah.

760
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,879
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是的

761
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:19,424
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}There's even a listening booth.

762
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:19,424
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}还有个试听室呢

763
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:25,494
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Have you heard of this singer?

764
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:25,494
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}听说过这个歌手吗?

765
00:26:27,302 --> 00:26:29,566
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I think she's American. A friend told me about her.

766
00:26:27,302 --> 00:26:29,566
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是美国人,有个朋友跟我提起过

767
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:33,104
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Do you want to go see if that listening booth still works?

768
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:33,104
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}想看看试听室是否还能用吗?

769
00:26:33,308 --> 00:26:34,502
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, okay.

770
00:26:33,308 --> 00:26:34,502
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}当然想

771
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:16,809
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}There's a wind that Blows in from the north

772
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:16,809
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}~北面吹来一阵风

773
00:27:17,018 --> 00:27:21,853
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And it says that loving Takes this course

774
00:27:17,018 --> 00:27:21,853
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}~诉说着爱意的来临

775

780

788
00:27:49,551 --> 00:27:54,488
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}~是否我从未躺在你身旁

789

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Baby, let's forget about this pride

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Quick. It's leaving.

798
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,142
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}快,车要开了

799
00:28:49,777 --> 00:28:51,301
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Look, there's a rabbit.

800
00:28:49,777 --> 00:28:51,301
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}看,有只兔子

801
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,912
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah.

802
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,912
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}嗯

803
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:55,538
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Hey there, rabbit.

804
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:55,538
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你好,兔子

805
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:58,116
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's so cute.

806
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:58,116
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}它真可爱

807
00:29:00,722 --> 00:29:03,122
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I visited this as a young teenager.

808
00:29:00,722 --> 00:29:03,122
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我十多岁时来过这

809
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:07,791
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It left a bigger impression on me at that time than the museums.

810
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:07,791
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}它当时留给我的印象比博物馆更深

811
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,793
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah? It's tiny.

812
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,793
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是吗?它很小

813
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,090
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I know.

814
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,090
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我知道

815
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,796
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}A little old man talked to us. He was the groundskeeper.

816
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,796
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}和我们聊天的墓地管理员是个矮小老头

817
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,836
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He explained that most of the people buried here...

818
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,836
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他解释说大部分埋在这里的人...

819
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,564
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...had washed up on the bank of the Danube.

820
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,564
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...都是被多瑙河水冲上岸的

821
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:23,543
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}How old are these?

822
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:23,543
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}有多久的历史了?

823
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:27,811
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Around the beginning of the century. It's called No Name Cemetery...

824
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:27,811
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}大约始建于本世纪初,被称为无名公墓

825
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,610
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...because they often didn't know who those people were.

826
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,610
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...因为他们大都不知道姓甚名谁

827
00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:32,911
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Maybe a first name, that's all.

828
00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:32,911
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}要不就是有名无姓

829
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:35,154
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Why were all the bodies washing up?

830
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:35,154
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}为什么所有尸体都是冲上岸的?

831
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:39,292
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I think some were from accidents on boats and things like that.

832
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:39,292
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我猜有些是因为船只失事之类的事故

833
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:42,793
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But most of them were suicides that jumped in the river.

834
00:29:39,494 --> 00:29:42,793
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但大部分是投河自尽的

835
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,530
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I always liked the idea of all those unknown people lost in the world.

836
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,530
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我喜欢这种想法--无名之人从世上消失

837
00:29:48,736 --> 00:29:50,795
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}When I was a little girl, I thought...

838
00:29:48,736 --> 00:29:50,795
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我是小女孩时曾想过...

839
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:53,530
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...if none of your family or friends knew you were dead...

840
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:53,530
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...如果没有任何亲友知道你已经死了...

841
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:55,709
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...then it's like not really being dead.

842
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:55,709
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...那就象没有真正死去

843
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,811
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}People can invent the best and the worst for you.

844
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,811
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}大家可以替你作最好或最坏的设想

845
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:04,376
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Here she is, I think.

846
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:04,376
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我想她就在这

847
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:08,019
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, this is the one I remember the most.

848
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:08,019
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}没错,这个我记得最清楚

849
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:13,586
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}She was only 13 when she died.

850
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:13,586
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}她死的时候只有13岁

851
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:18,398
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That meant something to me. I was that age when I first saw this.

852
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:18,398
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}在我来说意味深长, 我第一次来这就是13岁

853
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:27,671
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Now I'm 10 years older, and she's still 13, I guess.

854
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:27,671
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我现在长了10岁,可她还是13岁

855
00:30:28,843 --> 00:30:29,969
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That's funny.

856
00:30:28,843 --> 00:30:29,969
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这很有趣

857
00:30:50,264 --> 00:30:52,323
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That's the Danube over there.

858
00:30:50,264 --> 00:30:52,323
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那边就是多瑙河

859
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:54,495
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That's a river, right?

860
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:54,495
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是条河,对吧?

861
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:55,725
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah.

862
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:55,725
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是的

863
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:05,269
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}This is...

864
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:05,269
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}真是...

865
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:06,911
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...gorgeous.

866
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:06,911
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...壮观

867
00:31:07,915 --> 00:31:10,042
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, this is beautiful.

868
00:31:07,915 --> 00:31:10,042
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是啊,真美

869
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:17,518
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I mean, we got....

870
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:17,518
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我是指,我们赶上了...

871
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:19,416
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}We got a sunset here.

872
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:19,416
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们赶上了日落

873
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:22,727
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Yeah. -We got the Ferris wheel.

874
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:22,727
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-是的 -我们在摩天轮上

875
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:26,629
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It seems like...

876
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:26,629
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这就象...

877
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:28,925
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...this would be a....

878
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:28,925
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...是个...

879
00:31:30,938 --> 00:31:31,870
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What?

880
00:31:30,938 --> 00:31:31,870
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}什么?

881
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:37,336
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You know....

882
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:37,336
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你知道的...

883
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,950
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Are you trying to say you want to kiss me?

884
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,950
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你的意思是不是想吻我?

885
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:55,244
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But you know what?

886
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:55,244
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你知道吗?

887
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:58,391
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It doesn't matter what generation you're born into.

888
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:58,391
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}生于哪个时代并不重要

889
00:32:58,593 --> 00:32:59,855
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Look at my parents.

890
00:32:58,593 --> 00:32:59,855
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}看看我的父母

891
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:04,259
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}They were angry, young May ' 68 people revolting against everything.

892
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:04,259
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}68年5月事件,愤怒的年轻人反对一切

893
00:33:04,465 --> 00:33:08,231
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}The government, their conservative Catholic backgrounds....

894
00:33:04,465 --> 00:33:08,231
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}政府,及其保守的天主教后台....

895
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:11,928
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Then I was born, and my father became a successful architect.

896
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:11,928
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我出生之后,我父亲成为成功的建筑师

897
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:15,165
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}We traveled around the world while he built bridges...

898
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:15,165
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他建造桥梁时我们周游世界...

899
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:17,606
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and, you know, towers and stuff.

900
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:17,606
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...当然,还有塔和别的什么

901
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:20,677
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I mean, I really can't complain about anything.

902
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:20,677
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我是说,我真没什么可抱怨的

903
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:22,873
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}They love me more than anything...

904
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:22,873
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他们爱我胜过一切...

905
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,247
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and I've been raised with all the freedom they fought for.

906
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,247
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...我在他们努力营造的自由氛围中长大

907
00:33:26,454 --> 00:33:29,480
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And yet, for me now, it's another type of fight.

908
00:33:26,454 --> 00:33:29,480
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}对我而言这是另一种形式的抗争

909
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,023
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}We have to deal with the same shit, but we can't really know...

910
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,023
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们总是面对相同的问题,却不知道...

911
00:33:33,227 --> 00:33:35,718
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...who or, you know, what the enemy is.

912
00:33:33,227 --> 00:33:35,718
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...是和谁对抗,敌人是什么

913
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,763
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I don't know if there really is an enemy.

914
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,763
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我不知道是否真有这么个敌人

915
00:33:38,966 --> 00:33:41,025
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Everybody's parents fucked them up.

916
00:33:38,966 --> 00:33:41,025
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}所有的父母都不会教育孩子

917
00:33:41,235 --> 00:33:44,693
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Rich kids' parents gave them too much. Poor kids', not enough.

918
00:33:41,235 --> 00:33:44,693
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}有钱人的孩子父母给予得太多, 穷人的孩子则相反

919
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:47,272
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}too much attention, not enough attention.

920
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:47,272
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}关爱太多,关爱不够

921
00:33:47,475 --> 00:33:50,706
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}They either left or taught them the wrong things.

922
00:33:47,475 --> 00:33:50,706
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}或是遗弃或是教些错误的东西

923
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:54,712
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}My parents are just two people who didn't like each other much...

924
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:54,712
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我父母是两个相爱并不太深的人...

925
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,781
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...who got married and had a kid.

926
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,781
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...他们结婚,生子

927
00:33:56,984 --> 00:33:59,316
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And they tried their best to be nice to me.

928
00:33:56,984 --> 00:33:59,316
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}然后尽力对我好

929
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:03,488
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Did your parents divorce? -Yeah, finally.

930
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:03,488
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-你父母离婚了? -是的,最终离了

931
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:05,921
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}They should have done it sooner. They stuck together...

932
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:05,921
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他们早就该离,凑合在一起...

933
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,790
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...for the well-being of my sister and l. Thank you very much.

934
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,790
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...是为了我和我姐姐,真是感激不尽

935
00:34:10,097 --> 00:34:13,533
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I remember my mother told me right in front of my father...

936
00:34:10,097 --> 00:34:13,533
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我记得我母亲当着父亲的面告诉我...

937
00:34:13,734 --> 00:34:16,259
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...that he didn't really want to have me.

938
00:34:13,734 --> 00:34:16,259
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...他并不是很想要我

939
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:19,769
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That he was pissed off when he found out she was pregnant.

940
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:19,769
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他发现她怀孕时很恼火

941
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:23,603
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That I was a big mistake. That really shaped the way I think.

942
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:23,603
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}生我是个大错误, 这对我的思想影响很大

943
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:28,077
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I always saw the world as this place where I really wasn't meant to be.

944
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:28,077
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我习惯从一个不该存在的人的视角看世界

945
00:34:28,282 --> 00:34:29,271
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That's so sad.

946
00:34:28,282 --> 00:34:29,271
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}太悲哀了

947
00:34:29,483 --> 00:34:32,646
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Well, I mean, I eventually kind of took pride in it.

948
00:34:29,483 --> 00:34:32,646
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}事实上我对此颇感自豪

949
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:35,344
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You know, like my life was my own doing.

950
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:35,344
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}就好象生命是我自己创造的

951
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:38,684
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You know, like I was crashing the big party.

952
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:38,684
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}就象我是盛宴上的不速之客

953
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:40,918
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That's the way to see it.

954
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:40,918
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}可以这样看待

955
00:34:41,128 --> 00:34:44,495
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}My parents are still married and I guess they're happy.

956
00:34:41,128 --> 00:34:44,495
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我父母仍在一起,我猜他们很幸福

957
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:49,628
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But I think it's healthy to rebel against everything that came before.

958
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:49,628
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不过我觉得未雨绸缪是正确的做法

959
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:56,339
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You know, I've been wondering lately...

960
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:56,339
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}知道吗,最近我很好奇...

961
00:34:57,111 --> 00:35:00,547
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...do you know anyone who's in a happy relationship?

962
00:34:57,111 --> 00:35:00,547
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...你认识什么婚姻幸福的人吗?

963
00:35:02,216 --> 00:35:05,208
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, sure. You know, I know happy couples.

964
00:35:02,216 --> 00:35:05,208
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}当然,我认识一些幸福的夫妇

965
00:35:05,987 --> 00:35:08,046
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But I think they lie to each other.

966
00:35:05,987 --> 00:35:08,046
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}可我认为他们在互相欺骗

967
00:35:08,756 --> 00:35:10,018
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah.

968
00:35:08,756 --> 00:35:10,018
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是啊

969
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:13,085
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}People can live their whole life as a lie.

970
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:13,085
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}人们能在谎言中生活一辈子

971
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:15,194
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}My grandmother was married...

972
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:15,194
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我的祖母结了婚...

973
00:35:15,396 --> 00:35:18,490
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and I thought she had an uncomplicated love life.

974
00:35:15,396 --> 00:35:18,490
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...我以为她有份简单的爱情生活

975
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:22,726
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But she just confessed to me that she spent her whole life...

976
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:22,726
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但她向我承认,她穷其一生...

977
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:25,997
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...dreaming about another man she was in love with.

978
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:25,997
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...在梦想着她爱的另一个男人

979
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:29,538
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}She just accepted her fate. It's so sad.

980
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:29,538
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}她屈从于命运,这太可悲了

981
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:32,875
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}In the same time, I love that she had these emotions...

982
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:32,875
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但我也很高兴她有那种情感...

983
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,412
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and feelings I never thought she had.

984
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,412
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...而我从没想过她会有

985
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:37,846
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I guarantee you it was better that way.

986
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:37,846
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我敢说那样更好

987
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,419
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}If she'd known him, he'd have disappointed her eventually.

988
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,419
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}一旦了解了他,她最终会对他感到失望

989
00:35:41,622 --> 00:35:43,988
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-How do you know? -I know. I know.

990
00:35:41,622 --> 00:35:43,988
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-你怎么知道? -我当然知道

991
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:46,751
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}People put romantic projections on everything.

992
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:46,751
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}人们将浪漫想象得高于一切

993
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:49,657
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's not based in any kind of reality.

994
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:49,657
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那没有任何事实依据

995
00:35:49,864 --> 00:35:53,561
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Romantic projections? Oh, Mr. Romantic up in the Ferris wheel?

996

1098
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:33,642
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不过我希望你不要太当真...

1099
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:35,981
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...than some horoscope in a newspaper.

1100
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:35,981
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...和报纸上的占卜相比

1101
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:40,456
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What? She knew I was on vacation and that we didn't know each other...

1102
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:40,456
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}为什么?她知道我在渡假, 还知道我们互不相识

1103
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:43,562
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and that I was going to become this great woman.

1104
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:43,562
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...还有我会成为一个伟大的女人

1105
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:46,130
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But what was that "l am learning" bullshit?

1106
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:46,130
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那"我在学习"是什么鬼话?

1107
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:48,665
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That's way condescending, you know?

1108
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:48,665
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那是些套话,明白吗?

1109
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:50,928
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I mean, she wasn't even doing me.

1110
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:50,928
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}当时她并没看我的手

1111
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:55,471
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I mean, if opportunists like that ever had to tell the real truth...

1112
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:55,471
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}如果投机取巧者真是那样必须说真话的话

1113
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:57,735
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...it would put them out of business.

1114
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:57,735
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...他们就会失业

1115
00:39:57,945 --> 00:40:02,541
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Just once, I'd love to see some little old lady save up all her money...

1116
00:39:57,945 --> 00:40:02,541
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我乐意看到一个瘦小老妇 把她的所有积蓄...

1117
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:07,414
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...to go to the fortuneteller. She'd get there and the woman would say...

1118
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:07,414
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...拿去算命,到那后算命的女人说...

1119
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:12,550
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}..."Tomorrow and all your remaining days...

1120
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:12,550
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}"明天和你的下半辈子...

1121
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,785
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...will be exactly like today...

1122
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,785
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}"...会和今天全然相同...

1123
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,520
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...a tedious collection of hours.

1124
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,520
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}"...在无聊中度日

1125
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:20,962
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And you will have no new passions and no new thoughts...

1126
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:20,962
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}"你不会有新激情和新想法

1127
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,568
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and no new travels.

1128
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,568
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}"...没有新历程

1129
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:26,672
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And when you die, you'll be completely forgotten.

1130
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:26,672
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}"一旦死去就会被完全遗忘

1131
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:29,108
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Fifty schillings, please."

1132
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:29,108
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}"请给50先令"

1133
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,039
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That I'd like to see.

1134
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,039
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这是我乐意看到的

1135
00:40:32,112 --> 00:40:33,545
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's so funny how...

1136
00:40:32,112 --> 00:40:33,545
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这太有意思了...

1137
00:40:33,747 --> 00:40:37,274
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...she almost didn't notice you. It's weird. I wonder why.

1138
00:40:33,747 --> 00:40:37,274
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...她竟然没怎么注意你,不知是为什么

1139
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:41,648
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}She was really wise and intense. I really loved what she said.

1140
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:41,648
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}她睿智而且热情,我很喜欢听她说的话

1141
00:40:41,855 --> 00:40:45,689
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You pay your money to hear what makes you feel good about yourself.

1142
00:40:41,855 --> 00:40:45,689
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你是花钱来听让自己感觉良好的话

1143
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:49,385
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Maybe there's a seedy section of vienna. We can buy a hit of crack.

1144
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:49,385
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}维也纳也许有什么穷街陋巷能买到毒品

1145
00:40:49,596 --> 00:40:51,120
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Would you like that?

1146
00:40:49,596 --> 00:40:51,120
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那不是更好?

1147
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:53,456
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You're so....

1148
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:53,456
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你也太...

1149
00:40:54,668 --> 00:40:56,761
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Stardust. Stardust.

1150
00:40:54,668 --> 00:40:56,761
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}星尘,星尘

1151
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,976
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}There's an exhibition.

1152
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,976
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}有个展览

1153
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:13,050
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I guess we'll miss it. It doesn't start until next week.

1154
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:13,050
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们赶不上了,要下周才开始

1155
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,454
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, I think so.

1156
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,454
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}看来是这样

1157
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,490
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I actually saw this one in a museum.

1158
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,490
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}其实我在博物馆见过这个

1159
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:23,729
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I stared and stared at it.

1160
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:23,729
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我一直盯着它看

1161
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:26,229
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Must have been 45 minutes.

1162
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:26,229
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}足足有45分钟

1163
00:41:27,001 --> 00:41:28,059
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I love it.

1164
00:41:27,001 --> 00:41:28,059
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我喜欢它

1165
00:41:28,936 --> 00:41:31,370
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}La voie ferree. It's great.

1166
00:41:28,936 --> 00:41:31,370
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}La Voie Ferree,真漂亮

1167
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,735
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I love the way the people are dissolving into the background.

1168
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,735
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我喜欢这种人物溶入背景的方式

1169
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:39,077
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Look at this.

1170
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:39,077
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}看这个

1171
00:41:40,848 --> 00:41:42,338
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's like the environments...

1172
00:41:40,848 --> 00:41:42,338
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}似乎环境...

1173
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:44,944
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...are stronger than the people.

1174
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:44,944
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...比人物还要强烈

1175
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,555
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}His human figures are always so transitory.

1176
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,555
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他的人物轮廓总是很简略

1177
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,816
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's funny. Transitory?

1178
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,816
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}有意思吧,简略?

1179
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:53,793
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Transitory.

1180
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:53,793
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}简略

1181
00:42:12,846 --> 00:42:15,872
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-You think this is open? -I don't know. Let's try it.

1182
00:42:12,846 --> 00:42:15,872
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-你觉得开门没有? -不知道,试试看

1183
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:44,040
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I was in an old church like this...

1184
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:44,040
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我到过一家这样的教堂...

1185
00:42:44,244 --> 00:42:47,372
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...with my grandmother a few days ago in Budapest.

1186
00:42:44,244 --> 00:42:47,372
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...几天前在布达佩斯和我祖母一起

1187
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,316
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Even though I reject most of the religious thing...

1188
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,316
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}尽管我排斥大部分宗教的东西...

1189
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,612
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...I can't help but feeling for those people that come here...

1190
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,612
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...可还是不自觉地 感受到来这的人...

1191
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,089
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...lost or in pain, guilt...

1192
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,089
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...迷失,痛苦,内疚...

1193
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,160
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...looking for some kind of answers.

1194
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,160
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...在寻求某种答案

1195
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:08,328
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It fascinates me how a single place can join pain and happiness...

1196
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:08,328
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}能同时容纳那么多代人的 痛苦和快乐的地方令...

1197
00:43:08,535 --> 00:43:10,867
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...of so many generations.

1198
00:43:08,535 --> 00:43:10,867
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...令我着迷

1199
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:13,565
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You're close with your grandmother?

1200
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:13,565
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你和祖母很亲近?

1201
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,400
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah.

1202
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,400
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是的

1203
00:43:18,812 --> 00:43:22,509
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I think it's because I always have this strange feeling...

1204
00:43:18,812 --> 00:43:22,509
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}大概是因为我经常有种奇特的感觉...

1205
00:43:22,716 --> 00:43:26,709
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...that I'm this very old woman laying down, about to die.

1206
00:43:22,716 --> 00:43:26,709
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...我是那个躺着垂死的衰老妇人

1207
00:43:28,322 --> 00:43:30,517
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You know, that my life is just...

1208
00:43:28,322 --> 00:43:30,517
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}知道吗,我的生活就是...

1209
00:43:30,824 --> 00:43:32,553
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...her memories or something.

1210
00:43:30,824 --> 00:43:32,553
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...她的记忆或是什么

1211
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,925
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That's so wild.

1212
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,925
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这太疯狂了

1213
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:43,562
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I always think that I'm still this 13-year-old boy...

1214
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:43,562
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我时常觉得自己仍然是13岁的小孩...

1215
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,864
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...who doesn't really know how to be an adult, pretending to...

1216
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,864
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...不知道怎么做成年人,装模作样...

1217
00:43:47,074 --> 00:43:51,568
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...live my life, taking notes for when I'll really have to do it.

1218
00:43:47,074 --> 00:43:51,568
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...过自己的生活, 逼不得已时做做笔记

1219
00:43:51,945 --> 00:43:54,846
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Like I'm in a dress rehearsal for a junior high play.

1220
00:43:51,945 --> 00:43:54,846
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}仿佛是穿着戏服在演一场初中话剧

1221
00:43:57,284 --> 00:43:58,774
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That's funny.

1222
00:43:57,284 --> 00:43:58,774
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}真有趣

1223
00:43:59,586 --> 00:44:01,884
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Then up there in the Ferris wheel, it was like...

1224
00:43:59,586 --> 00:44:01,884
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那么在摩天轮上时,就象是...

1225
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:06,150
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...this very old woman kissing this very young boy. Right?

1226
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:06,150
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...垂老妇人吻了一个小男孩,是吗?

1227
00:44:10,964 --> 00:44:15,025
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Do you know anything about the Quakers, the Quaker religion?

1228
00:44:10,964 --> 00:44:15,025
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你知道贵格教徒和贵格教的宗旨吗?

1229
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:16,527
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}No, not much.

1230
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:16,527
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不太清楚

1231
00:44:17,437 --> 00:44:20,065
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Well, I went to this Quaker wedding once...

1232
00:44:17,437 --> 00:44:20,065
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我参加过贵格教徒的婚礼...

1233
00:44:20,274 --> 00:44:22,139
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and it was fantastic.

1234
00:44:20,274 --> 00:44:22,139
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...感觉很奇特

1235
00:44:22,476 --> 00:44:23,636
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What they do is...

1236
00:44:22,476 --> 00:44:23,636
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他们的做法是...

1237
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:28,110
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...the couple comes in and they kneel in front of the whole congregation...

1238
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:28,110
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...新人走进去跪在所有来宾的面前...

1239
00:44:28,315 --> 00:44:29,839
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and they stare at each other.

1240
00:44:28,315 --> 00:44:29,839
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...然后彼此凝视

1241
00:44:31,018 --> 00:44:34,977
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Nobody says a word unless they feel that God moves them to speak...

1242
00:44:31,018 --> 00:44:34,977
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}没人说话,除非他们觉得 是上帝要他们交谈...

1243
00:44:35,189 --> 00:44:36,850
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...or say something.

1244
00:44:35,189 --> 00:44:36,850
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...或发言

1245
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:40,453
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And then, after an hour or so of just...

1246
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:40,453
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}然后,经过大约一小时...

1247
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,760
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...staring at each other...

1248
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,760
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...相互凝视...

1249
00:44:44,231 --> 00:44:45,596
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...they're married.

1250
00:44:44,231 --> 00:44:45,596
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...就成了夫妻

1251
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:49,593
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That's beautiful. I like that.

1252
00:44:47,534 --> 00:44:49,593
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}太美了,我喜欢这样

1253
00:45:06,386 --> 00:45:07,876
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}This is a horrible story.

1254
00:45:06,386 --> 00:45:07,876
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}有个可怕的故事

1255
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:09,945
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What?

1256
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:09,945
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是什么?

1257
00:45:10,524 --> 00:45:12,890
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's not the appropriate place to tell it.

1258
00:45:10,524 --> 00:45:12,890
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这里不适合讲这事

1259
00:45:13,093 --> 00:45:16,028
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Well, I was driving around with this buddy of mine.

1260
00:45:13,093 --> 00:45:16,028
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我曾和一个朋友开车兜风

1261
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,130
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He's a big atheist, you know.

1262
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,130
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他是个坚定的无神论者

1263
00:45:18,332 --> 00:45:21,199
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And he came to a stop next to this homeless guy.

1264
00:45:18,332 --> 00:45:21,199
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他在一个流浪汉身旁停下车

1265
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,698
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}My buddy takes out a $ 100 bill...

1266
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,698
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}然后掏出100美元...

1267
00:45:23,904 --> 00:45:25,303
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and leans out the window...

1268
00:45:23,904 --> 00:45:25,303
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...探出车窗...

1269
00:45:25,505 --> 00:45:28,770
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and he says, "Do you believe in God? "

1270
00:45:25,505 --> 00:45:28,770
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...问道,"你相信上帝吗?"

1271
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:33,341
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And the guy looks at my friend, he looks at the money.

1272
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:33,341
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那个人看看我的朋友,看看钱

1273
00:45:33,614 --> 00:45:35,514
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He says...

1274
00:45:33,614 --> 00:45:35,514
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}说道...

1275
00:45:35,882 --> 00:45:37,543
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}..."Yes, I do."

1276
00:45:35,882 --> 00:45:37,543
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}..."是的,我相信"

1277
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:39,685
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}My friend says, "Wrong answer."

1278
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:39,685
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我朋友说,"回答错误"

1279
00:45:39,886 --> 00:45:41,376
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}We drove away.

1280
00:45:39,886 --> 00:45:41,376
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}然后开车走了

1281
00:45:42,222 --> 00:45:43,712
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That's mean.

1282
00:45:42,222 --> 00:45:43,712
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}太可恶了

1283
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:58,836
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Would you be in Paris by now if you hadn't gotten off the train?

1284
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:58,836
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}如果你不下火车,现在该到巴黎了吧?

1285
00:45:59,306 --> 00:46:00,967
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}No, not yet.

1286
00:45:59,306 --> 00:46:00,967
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不,还没到

1287
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:03,337
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What would you be doing?

1288
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:03,337
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那你会做些什么?

1289
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:06,205
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'd probably be hanging around the airport...

1290
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:06,205
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}也许会在机场逗留...

1291
00:46:06,413 --> 00:46:09,780
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...crying in my coffee because you didn't come with me.

1292
00:46:06,413 --> 00:46:09,780
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...因为你不在而对着咖啡哭泣

1293
00:46:13,887 --> 00:46:17,653
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'd probably gotten off the train in Salzburg with someone else.

1294
00:46:13,887 --> 00:46:17,653
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}也许我会在萨尔茨堡和别人下车

1295
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,826
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Oh, yeah? Oh, I see.

1296
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,826
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}哦,是吗?我懂了

1297
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,927
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So I'm just a dumb American...

1298
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,927
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我只是个愚蠢的美国人...

1299
00:46:22,129 --> 00:46:26,259
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...momentarily decorating your blank canvas, huh?

1300
00:46:22,129 --> 00:46:26,259
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...只能用来当作临时点缀,是吗?

1301
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,628
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-I'm having a great time. -Really?

1302
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,628
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-我玩得很开心 -是吗?

1303
00:46:29,836 --> 00:46:31,064
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Me too.

1304
00:46:29,836 --> 00:46:31,064
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我也是

1305
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,841
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'm glad, because no one knows I'm here.

1306
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,841
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我很高兴没人知道我在这

1307
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,033
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I don't know anyone that would tell me...

1308
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,033
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不认识能告诉我...

1309
00:46:37,244 --> 00:46:39,337
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...all those bad things you've done.

1310
00:46:37,244 --> 00:46:39,337
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...你所做过的所有坏事的人

1311
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,878
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-I'll tell you some. -Yeah, I'm sure.

1312
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,878
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-我可以告诉你 -我相信

1313
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:46,876
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You hear so much shit about people. I always feel like...

1314
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:46,876
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}听过太多坏事之后我总觉得...

1315
00:46:47,087 --> 00:46:49,487
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...the general of an army when I start dating.

1316
00:46:47,087 --> 00:46:49,487
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...赴约时象个将军

1317
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,783
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Plotting my strategy and maneuverings...

1318
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,783
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}制订好战略战术

1319
00:46:51,992 --> 00:46:55,519
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...knowing his weak points, what would hurt him, seduce him.

1320
00:46:51,992 --> 00:46:55,519
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...了解他的弱点, 什么能伤害他,征服他

1321
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:57,262
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's horrible.

1322
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:57,262
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}真是恐怖

1323
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,331
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}If we were always around each other...

1324
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,331
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}如果我们一直呆在一块...

1325
00:47:03,537 --> 00:47:07,337
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...what would be the first thing about me that would drive you mad?

1326
00:47:03,537 --> 00:47:07,337
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...那我第一件能令你发疯的事是什么?

1327
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:11,044
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}No. I'm not going to answer this question.

1328
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:11,044
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不,我不想回答这个问题

1329
00:47:11,244 --> 00:47:14,338
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I dated this girl once who used to always ask me that.

1330
00:47:11,244 --> 00:47:14,338
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}有个和我约会过的姑娘经常问我...

1331
00:47:14,548 --> 00:47:16,140
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}"What about me bugs you? "

1332
00:47:14,548 --> 00:47:16,140
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}"我哪方面让你发疯?"

1333
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:20,047
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Finally I said, "l don't think you handle criticism too well."

1334
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:20,047
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}最后我说, "我觉得你的批评方式不太好"

1335
00:47:20,253 --> 00:47:23,347
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}She flew into a rage and broke up with me. That's true.

1336
00:47:20,253 --> 00:47:23,347
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}她勃然大怒和我分了手,这是真的

1337
00:47:23,557 --> 00:47:25,684
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}All she wanted was to have an excuse...

1338
00:47:23,557 --> 00:47:25,684
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}其实她是要找个借口...

1339
00:47:25,892 --> 00:47:28,588
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...to tell me what she thought was wrong with me.

1340
00:47:25,892 --> 00:47:28,588
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...来告诉我她不该和我交往

1341
00:47:28,795 --> 00:47:30,023
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Is that what you want?

1342
00:47:28,795 --> 00:47:30,023
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你也想这样吗?

1343
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,959
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Something about me bugs you?

1344
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,959
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我哪些方面让你发狂?

1345
00:47:32,466 --> 00:47:35,367
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-What is it about me bugs you? -Nothing at all.

1346
00:47:32,466 --> 00:47:35,367
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-我有什么会令你崩溃? -根本没有

1347
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:38,037
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}If it had to be something, what would it be?

1348
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:38,037
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}如果非要说的话,会是什么?

1349
00:47:38,405 --> 00:47:41,897
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}If it had to be something, if I had to think about it...

1350
00:47:38,405 --> 00:47:41,897
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}如果非得有,而我非得考虑的话...

1351
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,704
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...I kind of didn't really like this reaction at the palm reader.

1352
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,704
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...我不太喜欢你对看手相的反应

1353
00:47:45,912 --> 00:47:48,278
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You were like this rooster prick.

1354
00:47:45,912 --> 00:47:48,278
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}就象只好斗的公鸡

1355
00:47:48,482 --> 00:47:50,347
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What the hell is a rooster prick?

1356
00:47:48,482 --> 00:47:50,347
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}什么叫好斗的公鸡?

1357
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,040
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You were like a boy whining...

1358
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,040
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你象个哭闹的孩子...

1359
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:54,914
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...because all the attention wasn't focused on him.

1360
00:47:52,252 --> 00:47:54,914
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...因为所有注意力都不在你身上

1361
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:58,216
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}All right, listen. This woman robs you blind, okay?

1362
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:58,216
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}好吧,听着,那女人蒙蔽了你,对吗?

1363
00:47:58,425 --> 00:48:00,757
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You were like a boy walking by an ice-cream store...

1364
00:47:58,425 --> 00:48:00,757
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你象个路过冰淇淋店的小孩...

1365
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,725
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...crying because his mom won't buy him a milk shake.

1366
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,725
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...因为妈妈不给他买奶昔而哭闹

1367
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:06,990
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I don't care what this charlatan has to say about--

1368
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:06,990
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我不在乎那江湖骗子说过什么--

1369
00:48:09,202 --> 00:48:10,328
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What?

1370
00:48:09,202 --> 00:48:10,328
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}什么?

1371
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,674
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I understand a little, but he doesn't at all.

1372
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,674
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我懂一点,但他不懂,抱歉

1373
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:21,237
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}May I ask you a question?

1374
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:21,237
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}能问你个问题吗?

1375
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:26,484
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So I would like to make a deal with you.

1376
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:26,484
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我想和你们做个交易

1377
00:48:28,388 --> 00:48:32,586
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I mean, instead of just asking you for money, I will ask you for a word.

1378
00:48:28,388 --> 00:48:32,586
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我不直接向你们要钱,而是让你们说一个词

1379
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:37,393
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You give me a word, I take the word, and then I will write a poem...

1380
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:37,393
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你们给我一个词,然后我会写一首诗

1381
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,098
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...with the word inside.

1382
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,098
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...将它包含在内

1383
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,801
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And if you like it, if you like my poem...

1384
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,801
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}如果你们喜欢我的诗...

1385
00:48:43,203 --> 00:48:45,763
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...if it adds something to your life in any way...

1386
00:48:43,203 --> 00:48:45,763
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...觉得它能给你们的生活增添色彩...

1387
00:48:45,972 --> 00:48:48,600
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...then you can pay me whatever you feel like.

1388
00:48:45,972 --> 00:48:48,600
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...那就随意给我一些报酬

1389
00:48:49,276 --> 00:48:51,267
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'll write in English, of course.

1390
00:48:49,276 --> 00:48:51,267
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}当然,我会用英语来写

1391
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,207
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Okay. -All right. Great.

00:52:13,179 --> 00:52:14,874
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It was wonderful, no?

1508

00:52:19,552 --> 00:52:22,214
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-What? -He probably didn't just write that.

1510
00:52:19,552 --> 00:52:22,214
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-怎么了? -那可能不是他写的

1511
00:52:22,422 --> 00:52:25,084
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He wrote it, but he probably plugs that word in.

1512
00:52:22,422 --> 00:52:25,084
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}也许他只是加了一个词进去

00:52:29,562 --> 00:52:31,757
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Nothing. I loved it. It was great.

00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,938
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...how great technology is, how it saves all this time.

1522
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,938
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...科技如何伟大,如何节省时间

1523
00:52:45,145 --> 00:52:48,137
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But what good is saved time if nobody uses it?

1524
00:52:45,145 --> 00:52:48,137
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但节省了时间却不加以利用有什么好呢？

1525
00:52:48,348 --> 00:52:50,680
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}If it just turns into more busy work.

00:52:48,348 --> 00:52:50,680
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}或者只是变成更多的工作

1527
00:52:50,884 --> 00:52:55,321
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I never hear anybody say, "With the time I've saved using my word processor...

00:52:50,884 --> 00:52:55,321
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}从没听人说，''用打字机省下的时间...

00:52:58,792 --> 00:53:01,784
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-从没听说过 -时间太抽象了

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I mean, I'm not that sorry. Tell me about it.

1566
00:55:08,254 --> 00:55:10,984
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这话题就不那么有趣了,说说看

1567
00:55:11,191 --> 00:55:14,957
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}No way. I can't. It's really, really boring.

1571
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,162
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I was really disappointed.

1572
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,162
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}好吧,我很失望

1573
00:55:21,367 --> 00:55:24,393
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I thought this one would last for a while. He was...

00:55:21,367 --> 00:55:24,393
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}原以为能维持一段时间,可他...

00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:28,672
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...very stupid, ugly, bad in bed, alcoholic....

1576
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:28,672
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...愚蠢,粗鲁,没情趣,酗酒....

1577
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,170
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-You know. -A real prize winner.

00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,170
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}纯粹是个草包

1579
00:55:33,313 --> 00:55:35,213
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I was kind of giving him a favor.

1580
00:55:33,313 --> 00:55:35,213
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我是想给他留点面子

1581
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,179
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But he left me, saying I loved him too much.

1582
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,179
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但他离开了我,说什么我太爱他...

1583
00:55:38,384 --> 00:55:43,117
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I was blocking his artistic expression or some shit like that.

1584
00:55:38,384 --> 00:55:43,117
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}妨碍了他的所谓狗屁艺术表现力

1585
00:55:43,857 --> 00:55:46,451
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But anyway, I was traumatized and became--

00:55:43,857 --> 00:55:46,451
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不管怎样,我很受伤害,变得--

00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,290
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And became totally obsessed with him.

1588
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,290
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}由于他而变得很困惑

1589
00:55:49,796 --> 00:55:52,924
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So I went to a shrink, and it came up that I had written...

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...this stupid story about this woman trying to kill her boyfriend...

1592
00:55:53,132 --> 00:55:57,592
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...关于女人想杀死她男友 及如何下手...

1593
00:55:58,638 --> 00:55:59,935
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and how she'd do it.

1594
00:55:58,638 --> 00:55:59,935
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...的愚蠢故事

1595

1597
00:56:03,676 --> 00:56:05,667
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}She was gonna kill her boyfriend?

1598
00:56:03,676 --> 00:56:05,667
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}她想杀死男朋友?

1599
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,912
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, she was. It's nothing I would do, but it was just some writing.

1600
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,912
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是的,我不会真去做,只是编的罢了

1601
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,380
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}No, I understand.

1602
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,380
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是的,我明白

1603
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:16,419
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}This stupid shrink believed everything I told her.

1604
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:16,419
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}愚蠢的医生相信了我说的一切

1605
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:20,320
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It was my first time seeing her. She said she had to call the police.

1606
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:20,320
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是我第一次就诊,她说必须通知警察

1607
00:56:20,526 --> 00:56:22,426
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}She had to call the police?

1608
00:56:20,526 --> 00:56:22,426
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}她必须通知警察?

1609
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,928
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}She was totally convinced I was really gonna do it.

1610
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,928
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}她完全相信我会付诸行动

1611
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:30,068
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Even though I had explained it was just some writing.

1612
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:30,068
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}即使我解释那只是我编造的

1613
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:33,205
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}She said, looking into my eyes, "The way you said it...

1614
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:33,205
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}她看着我的眼睛说 "你说的这些...

1615
00:56:33,406 --> 00:56:35,271
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...I know you are going to do it."

1616
00:56:33,406 --> 00:56:35,271
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...我知道你会去做"

1617
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:38,035
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}She was totally out of her mind.

1618
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:38,035
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}她纯粹是疯了

1619
00:56:38,845 --> 00:56:41,405
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It was my first and last session.

1620
00:56:38,845 --> 00:56:41,405
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那是我唯一一次看心理医生

1621
00:56:41,614 --> 00:56:43,377
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So what happened then?

1622
00:56:41,614 --> 00:56:43,377
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那么后来呢?

1623
00:56:45,285 --> 00:56:47,344
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I totally got over him.

1624
00:56:45,285 --> 00:56:47,344
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我彻底忘记了他

1625
00:56:47,787 --> 00:56:49,118
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But now, I'm obsessed...

1626
00:56:47,787 --> 00:56:49,118
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}现在我烦恼的是...

1627
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:53,816
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...that he's gonna die from an accident or 1000 kilometers away.

1628
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:53,816
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...如果他死于千里之外的一场事故

1629
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,355
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And I'm gonna be the one accused.

1630
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,355
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}受指控的将是我

1631
00:56:58,831 --> 00:57:01,595
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Why is it you become obsessed with people you don't...

1632
00:56:58,831 --> 00:57:01,595
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}为什么我们会为不那么喜欢的人...

1633
00:57:01,801 --> 00:57:03,530
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...really like that much?

1634
00:57:01,801 --> 00:57:03,530
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...感到困惑呢？

1635
00:57:03,736 --> 00:57:05,101
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I don't know.

1636
00:57:03,736 --> 00:57:05,101
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不知道

1637
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,507
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So how about you?

1638
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,507
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那你呢?

1639
00:57:10,476 --> 00:57:12,706
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-What? -Are you with anyone?

1640
00:57:10,476 --> 00:57:12,706
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-什么? -和谁在一起?

1641
00:57:14,614 --> 00:57:18,380
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's funny how we managed to avoid this subject for so long.

1642
00:57:14,614 --> 00:57:18,380
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们一直回避这个话题可真滑稽

1643
00:57:18,584 --> 00:57:20,347
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But now you have to tell me.

1644
00:57:18,584 --> 00:57:20,347
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}可你现在得告诉我

1645
00:57:20,553 --> 00:57:22,748
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Well, I kind of see love...

1646
00:57:20,553 --> 00:57:22,748
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我对爱的注脚是--

1647
00:57:22,956 --> 00:57:27,188
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...as this escape for two people who don't know how to be alone.

1648
00:57:22,956 --> 00:57:27,188
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}两个不知该如何独处的人的庇荫

1649
00:57:28,995 --> 00:57:31,463
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's funny. People always talk about how...

1650
00:57:28,995 --> 00:57:31,463
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}真有趣,人们总是说...

1651
00:57:31,664 --> 00:57:34,462
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...Iove is this totally unselfish, giving thing.

1652
00:57:31,664 --> 00:57:34,462
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...爱是完全无私的付出

1653
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:37,932
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But if you think about it, there's nothing more selfish.

1654
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:37,932
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但细想想却除了自私什么都没有

1655
00:57:38,771 --> 00:57:40,033
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I know.

1656
00:57:38,771 --> 00:57:40,033
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我明白

1657
00:57:40,873 --> 00:57:42,807
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So who just broke up with you?

1658
00:57:40,873 --> 00:57:42,807
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那么,你刚和谁分手?

1659
00:57:44,744 --> 00:57:45,904
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What?

1660
00:57:44,744 --> 00:57:45,904
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}什么?

1661
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,512
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You sound like you just were hurt.

1662
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,512
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}听起来你象是受了伤害

1663
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,014
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Do I?

1664
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,014
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我?

1665
00:57:52,285 --> 00:57:53,547
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}All right.

1666
00:57:52,285 --> 00:57:53,547
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}好吧

1667
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,154
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Big confession.

1668
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,154
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我承认

1669
00:57:56,889 --> 00:57:59,483
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I should've told you this earlier or something.

1670
00:57:56,889 --> 00:57:59,483
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我应该早告诉你的

1671
00:58:00,493 --> 00:58:02,961
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I didn't come to Europe just to...

1672
00:58:00,493 --> 00:58:02,961
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我来欧洲不只是为了..

1673
00:58:03,162 --> 00:58:06,359
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...hang out and read Hemingway in Paris and shit like that.

1674
00:58:03,162 --> 00:58:06,359
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...在巴黎散心,读海明威

1675
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,399
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I saved up my money all spring to fly to Madrid...

1676
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,399
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}整个春季我都在攒钱,想去马德里...

1677
00:58:10,603 --> 00:58:13,163
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and spend the summer with my girlfriend--

1678
00:58:10,603 --> 00:58:13,163
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...和我的女友共渡夏季...

1679
00:58:13,373 --> 00:58:15,102
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Your girlfriend? -My ex-girlfriend...

1680
00:58:13,373 --> 00:58:15,102
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-你的女友? -前女友

1681
00:58:15,308 --> 00:58:18,641
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...who has been on this art history program for the last year.

1682
00:58:15,308 --> 00:58:18,641
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...过去一年来她一直在学艺术史

1683
00:58:18,845 --> 00:58:22,246
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Anyway, I got here. We were reunited at long last...

1684
00:58:18,845 --> 00:58:22,246
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}总之,我到了这,久别重逢...

1685
00:58:22,448 --> 00:58:26,578
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and we went out to dinner our first night with six of her friends.

1686
00:58:22,448 --> 00:58:26,578
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...第一晚是和她的6个朋友一起出去吃饭

1687
00:58:26,786 --> 00:58:29,414
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo...

1688

1690
00:58:29,622 --> 00:58:31,783
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...玛丽娅,老乡苏茜

1691
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:35,358
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}She managed to avoid being alone with me for the first few days...

1692
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:35,358
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}好几天她都设法回避和我独处...

1693
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:40,191
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and I stuck around just to let it sink in that she wished I hadn't come.

1694
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:40,191
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...慢慢我意识到她并不希望我来

1695
00:58:41,968 --> 00:58:45,734
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So I bought the cheapest flight out, this one leaving out of vienna.

1696
00:58:41,968 --> 00:58:45,734
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}于是买了从维也纳起飞的最便宜的机票

1697
00:58:45,938 --> 00:58:49,430
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It didn't leave for a couple weeks, so I bought this Eurail pass.

1698
00:58:45,938 --> 00:58:49,430
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}几周内没有航班,所以我又买了火车票

1699
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:54,239
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You know what's the worst thing about somebody breaking up with you?

1700
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:54,239
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}知道别人和你分手最糟糕的事是什么吗?

1701
00:58:56,149 --> 00:58:58,947
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's when you remember how little you thought about...

1702
00:58:56,149 --> 00:58:58,947
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是当你记起自己很少想到...

1703
00:58:59,152 --> 00:59:01,882
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...the people you broke up with, and you realize...

1704
00:58:59,152 --> 00:59:01,882
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...与之分手的人,并意识到...

1705
00:59:02,088 --> 00:59:05,717
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...that that is how little they're thinking about you.

1706
00:59:02,088 --> 00:59:05,717
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...他们也很少想到你

1707
00:59:05,925 --> 00:59:08,223
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You'd like to think you're both in pain...

1708
00:59:05,925 --> 00:59:08,223
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你以为双方都会感觉痛苦...

1709
00:59:08,428 --> 00:59:11,420
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...but really, they're just, "Hey, I'm glad you're gone."

1710
00:59:08,428 --> 00:59:11,420
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...实际上却是 "嘿,很高兴你离开"

1711
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:14,065
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Believe me, I know.

1712
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:14,065
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}相信我,我懂

1713
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,291
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You should look at bright colors.

1714
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,291
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你该注意积极的一面

1715
00:59:18,004 --> 00:59:19,869
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That's what the shrink told me.

1716
00:59:18,004 --> 00:59:19,869
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是那个心理医生告诉我的

1717
00:59:20,073 --> 00:59:22,667
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I was paying her 900 francs an hour...

1718
00:59:20,073 --> 00:59:22,667
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我付她900法郎1小时...

1719
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:25,173
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...to hear that l was a homicidal maniac...

1720
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:25,173
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...来倾听我是个杀人狂

1721
00:59:25,378 --> 00:59:29,439
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...but I could shift my obsession if l would concentrate on bright colors.

1722
00:59:25,378 --> 00:59:29,439
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...如果我注意积极的一面 就能消除我的困惑

1723
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,911
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Did it work?

1724
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,911
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}管用吗?

1725
00:59:34,454 --> 00:59:36,513
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Didn't help your pinball. -Well, no.

1726
00:59:34,454 --> 00:59:36,513
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-对玩弹球没帮助 -对,没有

1727
00:59:37,123 --> 00:59:40,923
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, well, you know, I haven't killed anyone lately.

1728
00:59:37,123 --> 00:59:40,923
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是的,要知道最近我没杀任何人

1729
00:59:41,127 --> 00:59:42,458
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Not lately?

1730
00:59:41,127 --> 00:59:42,458
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}近来没有?

1731
00:59:42,762 --> 00:59:44,662
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That's good. You're cured then.

1732
00:59:42,762 --> 00:59:44,662
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}真不错,你康复了

1733
00:59:51,104 --> 00:59:54,335
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}There's breeds of monkeys, and all they do is have sex...

1734
00:59:51,104 --> 00:59:54,335
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}有种猴子,它们整天都在交配...

1735
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,107
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...all the time.

1736
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,107
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...从早到晚

1737
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:58,539
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And they turn out to be the least violent...

1738
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:58,539
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}它们因此而最少攻击性...

1739
00:59:58,744 --> 01:00:01,713
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...the most peaceful, the most happy.

1740
00:59:58,744 --> 01:00:01,713
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...最平和,最快乐

1741
01:00:01,914 --> 01:00:04,405
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So maybe fooling around's not so bad.

1742
01:00:01,914 --> 01:00:04,405
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}所以鬼混未必就是坏事

1743
01:00:04,617 --> 01:00:07,745
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Are you talking about monkeys? -Yes, I am.

1744
01:00:04,617 --> 01:00:07,745
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-你是在说猴子吧? -是啊

1745
01:00:07,954 --> 01:00:09,319
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-I thought so. -Why?

1746
01:00:07,954 --> 01:00:09,319
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-我想也是 -怎么?

1747
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:13,219
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I never heard this one. But it reminds me of this perfect...

1748
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:13,219
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我从没听说过, 这让我觉得是为他们鬼混...

1749
01:00:13,426 --> 01:00:15,860
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...male argument to justify them fooling around.

1750
01:00:13,426 --> 01:00:15,860
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...找的完美借口

1751
01:00:16,062 --> 01:00:19,498
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Women monkeys are fooling around too. Everybody's fooling around.

1752
01:00:16,062 --> 01:00:19,498
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}母猴子也可以啊,大家都可以

1753
01:00:21,334 --> 01:00:24,895
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That's cute. I have this awful, paranoid thought...

1754
01:00:21,334 --> 01:00:24,895
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}真有趣,我有个可怕而偏激的念头...

1755
01:00:25,104 --> 01:00:28,301
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...that feminism was mostly invented by men so they could...

1756
01:00:25,104 --> 01:00:28,301
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...女权主义是男人创造的,好让他们...

1757
01:00:28,508 --> 01:00:29,805
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...fool around more.

1758
01:00:28,508 --> 01:00:29,805
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...更方便鬼混

1759
01:00:30,009 --> 01:00:33,172
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}"Woman, free your mind, free your body. Sleep with me.

1760
01:00:30,009 --> 01:00:33,172
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}"女人,解放头脑,解放身体,和我睡觉

1761
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:37,907
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}We're all happy and free, as long as I can fuck as much as I can."

1762
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:37,907
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}"我们都是快乐自由的, 只要能满足我的色欲"

1763
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,650
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}All right.

1764
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,650
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}好了,好了

1765
01:00:39,852 --> 01:00:43,151
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But maybe there's some biological things at work here.

1766
01:00:39,852 --> 01:00:43,151
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这也许包含有生物学的因素

1767
01:00:43,356 --> 01:00:44,880
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}If you had an island...

1768
01:00:43,356 --> 01:00:44,880
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}如果你有个岛...

1769
01:00:45,091 --> 01:00:49,721
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and there were 99 women on the island and only one man...

1770
01:00:45,091 --> 01:00:49,721
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...岛上有99个女人和1个男人...

1771
01:00:49,929 --> 01:00:52,727
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...in a year, you'd have the possibility of 99 babies.

1772
01:00:49,929 --> 01:00:52,727
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...1年后也许会多出99个孩子

1773
01:00:52,932 --> 01:00:56,231
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But if you have an island with 99 men and only one woman...

1774
01:00:52,932 --> 01:00:56,231
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但如果岛上是99个男人和1个女人...

1775
01:00:56,435 --> 01:01:01,099
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...in a year, you have the possibility of only one baby. So....

1776
01:00:56,435 --> 01:01:01,099
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...1年后就只可能有一个孩子,所以....

1777
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,374
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You know what?

1778
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,374
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你知道吗?

1779
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:06,739
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}On this island, I think there will be only, like, maybe 43 men left.

1780
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:06,739
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我猜岛上也许只会留下43个男人

1781
01:01:06,946 --> 01:01:10,848
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}They would've killed each other trying to fuck this poor woman.

1782
01:01:06,946 --> 01:01:10,848
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}为了和那可怜的女人性交他们会互相残杀

1783
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:15,282
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And on the other island, there would be 99 women, 99 babies...

1784
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:15,282
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}而另一个岛上会有99个女人,99个孩子

1785
01:01:15,488 --> 01:01:17,149
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and no more man.

1786
01:01:15,488 --> 01:01:17,149
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...但不再有男人

1787
01:01:17,356 --> 01:01:19,916
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Because they would've all eaten him alive.

1788
01:01:17,356 --> 01:01:19,916
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}因为她们会把他生吃掉

1789
01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:21,525
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Oh, yeah?

1790
01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:21,525
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}哦,是吗?

1791
01:01:21,727 --> 01:01:23,456
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}There's something to that.

1792
01:01:21,727 --> 01:01:23,456
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}对此可以这样说

1793
01:01:23,663 --> 01:01:27,827
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}On some level, women don't mind the idea of destroying a man.

1794
01:01:23,663 --> 01:01:27,827
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}某种程度上,女人并不介意毁掉一个男人

1795
01:01:29,035 --> 01:01:31,902
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I was walking down the street with my ex-girlfriend...

1796
01:01:29,035 --> 01:01:31,902
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我曾和我的前女友一起逛街...

1797
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:36,598
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and we'd just walked by these four thuggy-looking guys next to a Camaro.

1798
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:36,598
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...有4个长相凶恶的人站在一辆跑车附近

1799
01:01:36,809 --> 01:01:39,972
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And one of them says, "Hey, baby. Nice ass!"

1800
01:01:36,809 --> 01:01:39,972
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}其中一个说 "嘿,宝贝,屁股真漂亮"

1801
01:01:40,179 --> 01:01:43,842
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So I'm like, "No big deal. I won't get uptight about this."

1802
01:01:40,179 --> 01:01:43,842
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我觉得 "这没什么,没必要为此生气"

1803
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:45,608
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Plus, there were four of them.

1804
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:45,608
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}对,而且他们有4个人

1805
01:01:45,818 --> 01:01:48,787
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Exactly. But she says, "Fuck you, dickheads!"

1806
01:01:45,818 --> 01:01:48,787
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}就是,可她说 "去你妈的,混蛋"

1807
01:01:48,988 --> 01:01:52,185
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And I'm like, "Okay. Wait a minute, here."

1808
01:01:48,988 --> 01:01:52,185
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我想,"这下好了,等着瞧吧"

1809
01:01:52,391 --> 01:01:54,951
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}They're not gonna come over and kick her ass.

1810
01:01:52,391 --> 01:01:54,951
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他们可不会过来踢她的屁股

1811
01:01:55,161 --> 01:01:58,096
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So who just got pushed to the frontline on that one?

1812
01:01:55,161 --> 01:01:58,096
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那么谁会被顶到前线上去呢?

1813
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:01,266
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Women say they hate it if you're all protective.

1814
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:01,266
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}女人说她们讨厌被严加保护

1815
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:05,836
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But if it suits them, then they'll tell you you're being unmanly.

1816
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:05,836
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}如果照她的意思去做, 又说你不是男人

1817
01:02:06,038 --> 01:02:10,168
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You know what? I don't think woman really wants to destroy man.

1818
01:02:06,038 --> 01:02:10,168
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}知道吗?我不认为女人真的想毁掉男人

1819
01:02:11,077 --> 01:02:13,443
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Even if they want to, they don't succeed.

1820
01:02:11,077 --> 01:02:13,443
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}即使她们想也不会成功

1821
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,841
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'm sure even men are destroying women...

1822
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,841
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我相信恰恰是男人在毁掉女人...

1823
01:02:16,048 --> 01:02:19,108
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...or are capable of destroying women much more than women--

1824
01:02:16,048 --> 01:02:19,108
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...或者说相对而言更有能力毁掉女人

1825
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:21,616
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Anyway, it's depressing. You know what?

1826
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:21,616
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}总之,这令人沮丧,懂我意思吗?

1827
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,415
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-You wanna stop talking about this? -I hate it.

1828
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,415
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-你想停止这个话题? -我讨厌这些

1829
01:02:24,624 --> 01:02:26,182
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Men, women, it's....

1830
01:02:24,624 --> 01:02:26,182
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}男人,女人,这...

1831
01:02:26,392 --> 01:02:28,883
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}There's no end to it.

1832
01:02:26,392 --> 01:02:28,883
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}永无休止,就象...

1833
01:02:29,428 --> 01:02:30,918
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's like a skipping record.

1834
01:02:29,428 --> 01:02:30,918
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}就象张跳针的唱片

1835
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:34,327
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Every couple's been having this conversation forever.

1836
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:34,327
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}凡是夫妻都会永远讨论这问题

1837
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:36,626
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And nobody came up with anything.

1838
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:36,626
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但没人能得出结论

1839
01:02:53,286 --> 01:02:55,720
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I saw a documentary on that. It's a birth dance.

1840
01:02:53,286 --> 01:02:55,720
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我看过记录片说这是生育舞蹈

1841
01:02:55,921 --> 01:02:57,388
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}A birth dance?

1842
01:02:55,921 --> 01:02:57,388
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}生育舞蹈?

1843
01:03:25,851 --> 01:03:27,512
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Should I give her some money?

1844
01:03:25,851 --> 01:03:27,512
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我该给她钱吗?

1845
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,021
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Everything that's interesting costs a little money.

1846
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,021
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}所有有意思的事都要花钱

1847
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:34,550
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So a birth dance, huh?

1848
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:34,550
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}生育舞蹈,是吧?

1849
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,490
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Looked a little bit like a mating dance to me.

1850
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,490
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}在我看来有点象交配舞蹈

1851
01:03:37,697 --> 01:03:40,495
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}No, but really. Women used it when giving birth.

1852
01:03:37,697 --> 01:03:40,495
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不,是真的,女人临盆时就跳这个

1853
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,100
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}In part of the world, they still do it.

1854
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,100
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}世上仍有一部分人这么做

1855
01:03:44,337 --> 01:03:46,805
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}The woman in labor enters a tent...

1856
01:03:44,337 --> 01:03:46,805
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}临产的女人进到帐蓬里...

1857
01:03:47,006 --> 01:03:49,600
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and the women of her tribe surround her and dance.

1858
01:03:47,006 --> 01:03:49,600
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...同部落的女人围着她跳舞

1859
01:03:49,809 --> 01:03:52,107
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}They encourage her to dance with them...

1860
01:03:49,809 --> 01:03:52,107
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}并鼓励她一起跳

1861
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:54,609
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...so as to make the birth less painful.

1862
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:54,609
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...可以减轻分娩的痛苦

1863
01:03:54,814 --> 01:03:58,250
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And when the baby is born, they all dance in celebration.

1864
01:03:54,814 --> 01:03:58,250
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}孩子降生后大家一起起舞庆贺

1865
01:03:59,385 --> 01:04:01,649
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I don't think my mom would've gone for that.

1866
01:03:59,385 --> 01:04:01,649
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我猜我妈妈可不会这样做

1867
01:04:02,188 --> 01:04:06,386
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I like the idea of dancing as something everybody participates in.

1868
01:04:02,188 --> 01:04:06,386
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我喜欢跳舞这类所有人都能参与的活动

1869
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:09,720
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I know. I heard about this old guy...

1870
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:09,720
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我知道,我听说有个老头...

1871
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:12,056
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...who was watching some young people dance.

1872
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:12,056
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...他看到年轻人在跳舞

1873
01:04:12,264 --> 01:04:13,663
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He said, "How beautiful.

1874
01:04:12,264 --> 01:04:13,663
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}说道,"真美

1875
01:04:13,866 --> 01:04:16,801
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}They're shaking off their genitals to become angels."

1876
01:04:13,866 --> 01:04:16,801
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}"他们甩掉生殖器以变成天使"

1877
01:04:17,002 --> 01:04:17,900
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I like that.

1878
01:04:17,002 --> 01:04:17,900
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}有意思

1879
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,298
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}One question, though.

1880
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,298
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不过有个问题

1881
01:04:19,505 --> 01:04:23,168
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}When the women are dancing and being all spiritual and stuff...

1882
01:04:19,505 --> 01:04:23,168
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}当女人们全身心地投入到舞蹈中时...

1883
01:04:23,376 --> 01:04:24,468
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...where are the men?

1884
01:04:23,376 --> 01:04:24,468
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...男人们在哪?

1885
01:04:24,677 --> 01:04:28,977
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Are we out food gathering? Are we not invited? You all don't need us?

1886
01:04:24,677 --> 01:04:28,977
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}出去找食物了? 没被邀请?还是女人不需要男人?

1887
01:04:29,181 --> 01:04:31,479
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Men are lucky we don't bite off their heads after mating.

1888
01:04:29,181 --> 01:04:31,479
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}男人该庆幸没在交配后被咬下头颅

1889
01:04:31,684 --> 01:04:34,653
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Certain insects do that, like spiders and stuff?

1890
01:04:31,684 --> 01:04:34,653
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}实际上象蜘蛛什么的会那样做

1891
01:04:34,854 --> 01:04:37,254
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}We let you live. What are you complaining about?

1892
01:04:34,854 --> 01:04:37,254
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}能活着还有什么可抱怨的呢?

1893
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:41,085
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}See, you're officially kidding. But there's something to that.

1894
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:41,085
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你这是危言耸听,话里有话

1895
01:04:41,293 --> 01:04:43,420
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You keep bringing stuff like that up.

1896
01:04:41,293 --> 01:04:43,420
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你一直在强调某些观点

1897
01:04:44,063 --> 01:04:47,464
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}No, no. Wait a minute. Talking seriously here.

1898
01:04:44,063 --> 01:04:47,464
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不,没有,等一等,说正经的

1899
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:50,567
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I mean, I always feel this pressure of being...

1900
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:50,567
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我是说,我一直觉得...

1901
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:53,398
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...a strong and independent icon of womanhood...

1902
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:53,398
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...做一个坚强独立的女人,

1903
01:04:53,606 --> 01:04:55,631
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and not making it look like...

1904
01:04:53,606 --> 01:04:55,631
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...不让自己的全部生活围着哪个男人转,

1905
01:04:55,841 --> 01:04:58,935
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...my whole life is revolving around some guy.

1906
01:04:55,841 --> 01:04:58,935
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...有很大压力

1907
01:05:00,513 --> 01:05:01,844
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But loving someone...

1908
01:05:00,513 --> 01:05:01,844
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但是爱一个人...

1909
01:05:02,047 --> 01:05:05,483
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and being loved means so much to me.

1910
01:05:02,047 --> 01:05:05,483
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...与被人爱对我来说意义重大

1911
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,484
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I always make fun of it and stuff...

1912
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,484
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我常拿这类事情说笑...

1913
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:11,513
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...but isn't everything we do in life...

1914
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:11,513
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...可并非我们做的每件事...

1915
01:05:11,724 --> 01:05:14,591
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...a way to be loved a little more?

1916
01:05:11,724 --> 01:05:14,591
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...都能赢得更多的爱

1917
01:05:18,964 --> 01:05:20,261
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I don't know.

1918
01:05:18,964 --> 01:05:20,261
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我不知道

1919
01:05:20,699 --> 01:05:22,633
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Sometimes I dream...

1920
01:05:20,699 --> 01:05:22,633
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}有时候我梦想着...

1921
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:25,861
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...about being a good father and a good husband.

1922
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:25,861
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...做一个好父亲好丈夫

1923
01:05:26,071 --> 01:05:28,539
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And sometimes it feels really close.

1924
01:05:26,071 --> 01:05:28,539
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}而且有时候会觉得很接近了

1925
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:31,108
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But then other times...

1926
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:31,108
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}可另外一些时候...

1927
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,203
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...it seems silly...

1928
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,203
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...这想法似乎很蠢

1929
01:05:34,413 --> 01:05:35,880
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...like it would...

1930
01:05:34,413 --> 01:05:35,880
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...仿佛它会

1931
01:05:36,248 --> 01:05:38,045
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...ruin my whole life.

1932
01:05:36,248 --> 01:05:38,045
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...毁掉我全部的生活

1933
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:41,880
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And it's not just a fear of commitment...

1934
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:41,880
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不是由于对责任感的畏惧...

1935
01:05:42,087 --> 01:05:45,215
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...or that I'm incapable of caring or loving because...

1936
01:05:42,087 --> 01:05:45,215
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...或是没有能力去关爱,因为

1937
01:05:45,424 --> 01:05:46,652
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...I can.

1938
01:05:45,424 --> 01:05:46,652
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...我能胜任

1939
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:51,690
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's just that, if I'm totally honest with myself...

1940
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:51,690
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}如果我绝对公正地对待自己...

1941
01:05:51,964 --> 01:05:53,625
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...I think I'd rather die knowing...

1942
01:05:51,964 --> 01:05:53,625
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...那我宁死也不想知道...

1943
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:56,358
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...that I was really good at something.

1944
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:56,358
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...我擅长些什么

1945
01:05:56,569 --> 01:05:59,402
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That I had excelled in some way...

1946
01:05:56,569 --> 01:05:59,402
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}比起仅仅维系一份...

1947
01:05:59,638 --> 01:06:01,538
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...than that I'd just been in...

1948
01:05:59,638 --> 01:06:01,538
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...良好的, 友爱的关系来说,

1949
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:05,039
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...a nice, caring relationship.

1950
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:05,039
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}... 我还有哪些方面更突出

1951
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:14,651
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I had worked for this older man, and once he told me...

1952
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:14,651
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我曾为一个老人工作,有次他告诉我...

1953
01:06:14,854 --> 01:06:18,517
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...that he had spent all of his life thinking about his career.

1954
01:06:14,854 --> 01:06:18,517
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...他把一生的心思都放在了事业上

1955
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,022
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He was 52, and it suddenly struck him...

1956
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,022
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}52岁时他突然地发现...

1957
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,891
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...that he had never really given anything of himself.

1958
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,891
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...他从没为自己做过任何事

1959
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,665
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}His life was for no one and nothing.

1960
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,665
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他这辈子毫无作为

1961
01:06:28,968 --> 01:06:31,300
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He was almost crying saying that.

1962
01:06:28,968 --> 01:06:31,300
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他说这话时都要哭了

1963
01:06:34,306 --> 01:06:36,774
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I believe if there's any kind of God...

1964
01:06:34,306 --> 01:06:36,774
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我相信如果有神存在...

1965
01:06:36,976 --> 01:06:38,967
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...it wouldn't be in any of us...

1966
01:06:36,976 --> 01:06:38,967
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...不会存在于任何人身上

1967
01:06:39,278 --> 01:06:41,178
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...not you or me...

1968
01:06:39,278 --> 01:06:41,178
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...不会是你或者我

1969
01:06:41,947 --> 01:06:45,075
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...but just this little space in between.

1970
01:06:41,947 --> 01:06:45,075
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...而是存在于这小小的空间之中

1971
01:06:47,553 --> 01:06:50,113
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}If there's any kind of magic in this world...

1972
01:06:47,553 --> 01:06:50,113
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}如果世上有什么奇迹...

1973
01:06:50,322 --> 01:06:54,725
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something.

1974
01:06:50,322 --> 01:06:54,725
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...一定是尽力理解某个人, 并与之同甘共苦

1975
01:06:56,996 --> 01:07:00,295
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I know, it's almost impossible to succeed...

1976
01:06:56,996 --> 01:07:00,295
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我知道,这几乎是不可能成功的

1977
01:07:01,133 --> 01:07:02,862
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...but who cares really?

1978
01:07:01,133 --> 01:07:02,862
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...可谁真正在乎呢?

1979
01:07:03,969 --> 01:07:06,403
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}The answer must be in the attempt.

1980
01:07:03,969 --> 01:07:06,403
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}答案一定是在尝试之中

1981
01:08:14,873 --> 01:08:18,639
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I think this is a civilization in decline. Look at the service.

1982
01:08:14,873 --> 01:08:18,639
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我想文明正在衰亡,看看这服务吧

1983
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:22,280
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Where is the waitress? In New York, she'd be out of a job.

1984
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:22,280
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}侍者在哪?在纽约她肯定得失业

1985
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:33,551
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'm gonna call my friend in Paris...

1986
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:33,551
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我来给巴黎的一个朋友打电话

1987
01:08:33,726 --> 01:08:36,854
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...who I'm supposed to have lunch with in eight hours.

1988
01:08:33,726 --> 01:08:36,854
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...我想约她午休时一起吃饭

1989
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:46,298
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Pick up.

1990
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:46,298
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}接电话

1991
01:08:46,505 --> 01:08:48,439
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Pick up the phone. -All right.

1992
01:08:46,505 --> 01:08:48,439
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-接电话啊 -好的

1993
01:09:01,487 --> 01:09:05,389
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I've been working on my English. You wanna talk in English, for laughs?

1994
01:09:01,487 --> 01:09:05,389
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我正学英语,你说英语行吗?当作消遣

1995
01:09:05,824 --> 01:09:08,224
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, okay. That's a good idea.

1996
01:09:05,824 --> 01:09:08,224
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}行,这主意不错

1997
01:09:09,962 --> 01:09:13,454
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I don't think I'll be able to make it for lunch today.

1998
01:09:09,962 --> 01:09:13,454
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我今天不能陪你吃午饭了,对不起

1999
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:18,866
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I met a guy on the train, and I got off with him in vienna.

2000
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:18,866
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我在火车上认识了一个人, 和他在维也纳下了车

2001
01:09:19,104 --> 01:09:21,095
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Are you crazy?

2002
01:09:19,104 --> 01:09:21,095
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你疯了吗?

2003
01:09:22,141 --> 01:09:23,540
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Probably.

2004
01:09:22,141 --> 01:09:23,540
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}也许吧

2005
01:09:24,009 --> 01:09:27,035
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-He's Austrian? He's from there? -No, No.

2006
01:09:24,009 --> 01:09:27,035
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-他是不是奥地利人? -不,不是

2007
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:30,943
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He's passing through. He's American. He's going back home tomorrow.

2008
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:30,943
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是个游客,美国人,明天一早就要回家

2009
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:32,515
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Why'd you get off?

2010
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:32,515
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你为什么下车?

2011
01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:36,153
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Well, he convinced me.

2012
01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:36,153
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他说服了我

2013
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:40,855
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I mean, actually, I was ready to get off the train with him...

2014
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:40,855
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}实际上我在火车上和他聊过一阵之后...

2015
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,028
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...after talking to him a short while.

2016
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,028
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...就打算和他一起下车

2017
01:09:43,228 --> 01:09:45,253
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He was so sweet, I couldn't help it.

2018
01:09:43,228 --> 01:09:45,253
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他很有趣,让我情不自禁

2019
01:09:46,665 --> 01:09:49,099
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}In the lounge car, he began to talk about...

2020
01:09:46,665 --> 01:09:49,099
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}在休息车厢,他谈到...

2021
01:09:49,301 --> 01:09:52,395
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...him as a boy seeing his great-grandmother's ghost.

2022
01:09:49,301 --> 01:09:52,395
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...他小时候见过他曾祖母的鬼魂

2023
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:56,002
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I think that's when I fell for him.

2024
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:56,002
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我就是那时被他吸引住了

2025
01:09:57,109 --> 01:10:00,943
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Just the idea of this little boy with all those beautiful dreams.

2026
01:09:57,109 --> 01:10:00,943
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}就因为一个小男孩和他所有的美丽梦想

2027
01:10:02,414 --> 01:10:04,041
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He trapped me.

2028
01:10:02,414 --> 01:10:04,041
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他征服了我

2029
01:10:07,252 --> 01:10:08,947
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And he's so cute.

2030
01:10:07,252 --> 01:10:08,947
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}而且他很可爱

2031
01:10:09,154 --> 01:10:11,315
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He has beautiful blue eyes...

2032
01:10:09,154 --> 01:10:11,315
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他有漂亮的蓝眼睛...

2033
01:10:11,523 --> 01:10:13,514
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...nice pink lips...

2034
01:10:11,523 --> 01:10:13,514
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...漂亮的粉红色嘴唇...

2035
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:15,951
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...greasy hair.

2036
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:15,951
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...油腻的头发

2037
01:10:16,662 --> 01:10:18,254
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I love it.

2038
01:10:16,662 --> 01:10:18,254
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我很喜欢

2039
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:21,463
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He's kind of tall, and he's a little clumsy.

2040
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:21,463
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他高高的个子,有点笨拙

2041
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:25,569
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I like to feel his eyes on me when I look away.

2042
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:25,569
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我喜欢他偷偷看我的感觉

2043
01:10:30,275 --> 01:10:33,369
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He kind of kisses like an adolescent. It's so cute.

2044
01:10:30,275 --> 01:10:33,369
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他接吻时象个青涩少年,很可爱

2045
01:10:33,579 --> 01:10:37,140
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-What? -Yeah, we kissed. It was so adorable.

2046
01:10:33,579 --> 01:10:37,140
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-不是吧? -就是,我们接过吻,感觉非常棒

2047
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:41,177
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}As the night went on, I began to like him more and more.

2048
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:41,177
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}随着夜色降临,我越来越喜欢他

2049
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:44,648
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'm afraid he's scared of me.

2050
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:44,648
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我担心他有点怕我

2051
01:10:44,857 --> 01:10:48,816
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I told him the story about the woman that kills her ex-boyfriend.

2052
01:10:44,857 --> 01:10:48,816
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我跟他说过一个女人想杀死前男友的故事

2053
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:50,795
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He must be scared to death.

2054
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:50,795
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他肯定怕得要命

2055
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:54,261
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He must be thinking I'm this manipulative, mean woman.

2056
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:54,261
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他一定以为我是个专横歹毒的女人

2057
01:10:56,535 --> 01:10:59,026
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I just hope he doesn't feel that way about me.

2058
01:10:56,535 --> 01:10:59,026
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但愿他不会这样认为

2059
01:10:59,238 --> 01:11:02,207
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Because, you know me, I'm the most harmless person.

2060
01:10:59,238 --> 01:11:02,207
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}因为,你了解我,我决不会伤害别人

2061
01:11:03,709 --> 01:11:06,610
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}The only person I could really hurt is myself.

2062
01:11:03,709 --> 01:11:06,610
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}唯一能真正伤害的只有我自己

2063
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,413
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I don't think he's scared of you.

2064
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,413
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我不认为他会怕你

2065
01:11:09,615 --> 01:11:11,446
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I think he's crazy about you.

2066
01:11:09,615 --> 01:11:11,446
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我想他对你很着迷

2067
01:11:12,084 --> 01:11:14,177
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Really? -I've known you a long time.

2068
01:11:12,084 --> 01:11:14,177
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-真的? -我认识你很久了

2069
01:11:14,386 --> 01:11:16,854
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I got a good feeling. You gonna see him again?

2070
01:11:14,386 --> 01:11:16,854
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}对你印象很好,你还会再见他吗?

2071
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:22,059
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}We haven't talked about that yet.

2072
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:22,059
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们还没提到这个问题

2073
01:11:26,732 --> 01:11:29,428
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Okay, it's your turn. You call your friend.

2074
01:11:26,732 --> 01:11:29,428
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}好,到你了,打电话给你的朋友

2075
01:11:29,635 --> 01:11:31,535
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}All right, all right.

2076
01:11:29,635 --> 01:11:31,535
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}好的,好的

2077
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:37,465
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I usually get this guy's answering machine.

2078
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:37,465
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}通常只能接通他的答录机

2079
01:11:40,179 --> 01:11:41,806
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Hi, dude. What's up?

2080
01:11:40,179 --> 01:11:41,806
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}嘿,哥儿们,什么事?

2081
01:11:43,749 --> 01:11:46,582
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Hey, Frank. How you been? I'm glad you're home.

2082
01:11:43,749 --> 01:11:46,582
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}弗兰克,过得怎样?真高兴你在家

2083
01:11:46,785 --> 01:11:48,218
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Cool. Yeah.

2084
01:11:46,785 --> 01:11:48,218
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}挺好,是的

2085
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:49,978
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So how was Madrid?

2086
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:49,978
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}马德里怎么样?

2087
01:11:50,656 --> 01:11:52,749
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Madrid sucked.

2088
01:11:50,656 --> 01:11:52,749
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}没劲透了

2089
01:11:53,425 --> 01:11:56,087
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Lisa and I had our long overdue meltdown.

2090
01:11:53,425 --> 01:11:56,087
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}莉莎和我总算彻底玩完了

2091
01:11:56,628 --> 01:11:58,528
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Too bad. I told you, no?

2092
01:11:56,628 --> 01:11:58,528
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}太糟了,我早说过不是吗?

2093
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:01,893
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, yeah. The long-distance thing just never works.

2094
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:01,893
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}对,相隔太远从不会有结果

2095
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,125
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I was only in Madrid for a couple days.

2096
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,125
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我只在马德里呆了几天

2097
01:12:04,336 --> 01:12:06,998
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I got a cheaper flight out of vienna.

2098
01:12:04,336 --> 01:12:06,998
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我买了张最便宜的机票

2099
01:12:09,007 --> 01:12:12,238
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You know, it really wasn't that much cheaper. I just....

2100
01:12:09,007 --> 01:12:12,238
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}实际上并不太便宜,只不过...

2101
01:12:12,444 --> 01:12:16,676
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I couldn't go home right away. I didn't want to see anybody I knew.

2102
01:12:12,444 --> 01:12:16,676
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我不能马上回家,我不想见到任何熟人

2103
01:12:16,882 --> 01:12:19,646
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I just wanted to be a ghost, completely anonymous.

2104
01:12:16,882 --> 01:12:19,646
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}只想变成完全不为人知的游魂

2105
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,651
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So are you okay now?

2106
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,651
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你现在还好吧?

2107
01:12:22,855 --> 01:12:25,881
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah. I'm great. I'm great. That's the thing.

2108
01:12:22,855 --> 01:12:25,881
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}对,我很好,很好,真的

2109
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:27,458
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'm rapturous.

2110
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:27,458
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我很开心

2111
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,650
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And I'll tell you why.

2112
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,650
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}告诉你是为什么

2113
01:12:29,862 --> 01:12:32,763
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I met somebody on my last night in Europe.

2114
01:12:29,862 --> 01:12:32,763
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}在欧洲最后一晚我认识了一个人

2115
01:12:32,965 --> 01:12:35,661
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-That's incredible. -I know, I know.

2116
01:12:32,965 --> 01:12:35,661
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-难以置信 -我知道,我知道

2117
01:12:35,868 --> 01:12:39,235
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You know how they say we're all each other's demons and angels?

2118
01:12:35,868 --> 01:12:39,235
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}有句老话说我们是对方的魔鬼和天使

2119
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:43,639
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Well, she was literally a Botticelli angel...

2120
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:43,639
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}她无疑是波提且利画笔下的天使

2121
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,468
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...telling me everything would be okay.

2122
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,468
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...告诉我一切都会好起来

2123
01:12:49,481 --> 01:12:50,641
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}How did you meet?

2124
01:12:49,481 --> 01:12:50,641
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你们怎么认识的?

2125
01:12:52,251 --> 01:12:53,718
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}On the train.

2126
01:12:52,251 --> 01:12:53,718
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是在火车上

2127
01:12:54,186 --> 01:12:57,349
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}She was sitting next to a weird couple that was fighting...

2128
01:12:54,186 --> 01:12:57,349
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}她邻座的一对古怪夫妻在吵架

2129
01:12:57,556 --> 01:13:00,719
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...so she moved. She sat right across the aisle from me.

2130
01:12:57,556 --> 01:13:00,719
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...她换座时正好坐在过道对面

2131
01:13:00,926 --> 01:13:02,860
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So we started to talk.

2132
01:13:00,926 --> 01:13:02,860
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}于是我们开始聊天

2133
01:13:03,061 --> 01:13:05,256
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}She didn't like me much at first.

2134
01:13:03,061 --> 01:13:05,256
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}起初她不太喜欢我

2135
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:06,624
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}She's super smart...

2136
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:06,624
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}她非常聪明...

2137
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:09,529
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...very passionate...

2138
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:09,529
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...充满激情...

2139
01:13:10,102 --> 01:13:11,296
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and beautiful.

2140
01:13:10,102 --> 01:13:11,296
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...而且很漂亮

2141
01:13:12,838 --> 01:13:15,329
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And I was so unsure of myself.

2142
01:13:12,838 --> 01:13:15,329
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我却太缺乏自信

2143
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,371
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I thought everything I said sounded so stupid.

2144
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,371
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我觉得我说的话都很蠢

2145
01:13:20,245 --> 01:13:23,271
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Oh, man. I wouldn't worry about that.

2146
01:13:20,245 --> 01:13:23,271
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}哦,伙计,这我并不担心

2147
01:13:23,882 --> 01:13:26,146
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}No, I'm sure she was not judging you.

2148
01:13:23,882 --> 01:13:26,146
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}她不会因此而对你有成见

2149
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,950
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}No, and by the way, she sat next to you.

2150
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,950
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}再说了,她坐到了你旁边

2151
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:30,883
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'm sure she did it on purpose.

2152
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:30,883
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我相信她是有意如此

2153
01:13:31,089 --> 01:13:32,420
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Oh, yeah?

2154
01:13:31,089 --> 01:13:32,420
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}哦,是吗?

2155
01:13:36,194 --> 01:13:39,994
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Us men are so stupid. We don't understand anything about women.

2156
01:13:36,194 --> 01:13:39,994
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们男人太蠢了,一点也不了解女人

2157
01:13:41,266 --> 01:13:43,757
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}They act strange, the little I know of them.

2158
01:13:41,266 --> 01:13:43,757
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}她们行为古怪,我只知道这一点

2159
01:13:44,369 --> 01:13:45,666
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Don't they?

2160
01:13:44,369 --> 01:13:45,666
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}对不对?

2161
01:13:52,711 --> 01:13:56,613
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I feel like this is some dream world we're in.

2162
01:13:52,711 --> 01:13:56,613
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我觉得我们象是处在梦境之中

2163
01:13:56,815 --> 01:13:58,407
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, it's so weird.

2164
01:13:56,815 --> 01:13:58,407
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}对,这很奇怪

2165
01:13:58,817 --> 01:14:01,012
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's like our time together is just ours.

2166
01:13:58,817 --> 01:14:01,012
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}仿佛我们在一起的时间只属于我们

2167
01:14:01,219 --> 01:14:03,050
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's our own creation.

2168
01:14:01,219 --> 01:14:03,050
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是我们自己创造的

2169
01:14:03,789 --> 01:14:06,815
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It must be like I'm in your dream and you're in mine.

2170
01:14:03,789 --> 01:14:06,815
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}就象我在你梦里,你在我梦里

2171
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:10,992
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And what's so cool is that this whole evening...

2172
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:10,992
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}所以这一整夜才会如此美妙...

2173
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:14,688
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...all our time together, shouldn't officially be happening.

2174
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:14,688
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...客观地说我们本来是不会在一起的

2175
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:18,358
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why this feels so otherworldly.

2176
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:18,358
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我明白,所以才会感觉象在童话世界

2177
01:14:20,472 --> 01:14:24,067
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But then the morning comes and we turn into pumpkins, right?

2178
01:14:20,472 --> 01:14:24,067
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不过天亮之后我们就会变回南瓜,对不对?

2179
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:26,243
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I know.

2180
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:26,243
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我明白

2181
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:30,177
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But now, you're supposed to produce the glass slipper...

2182
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:30,177
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但是现在,你该拿出玻璃鞋...

2183
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:31,974
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and see if it fits.

2184
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:31,974
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...看看合不合适

2185
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,485
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It'll fit.

2186
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,485
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}会合适的

2187
01:14:55,007 --> 01:14:56,702
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}This friend of mine had a kkid...

2188
01:14:55,007 --> 01:14:56,702
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我有个朋友的孩子是在家里出生的,

2189
01:14:56,908 --> 01:15:00,139
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and it was a home birth, so he was there helping out.

2190
01:14:56,908 --> 01:15:00,139
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...所以他在那帮忙

2191
01:15:00,345 --> 01:15:03,143
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But he said at that profound moment of birth...

2192
01:15:00,345 --> 01:15:03,143
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他说生命降生之时的意义非凡

2193
01:15:04,616 --> 01:15:08,382
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...he was watching his child experiencing life for the first time...

2194
01:15:04,616 --> 01:15:08,382
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...他看着他的孩子第一次体验生命

2195
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,521
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...trying to take its first breath.

2196
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,521
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...试着第一次呼吸

2197
01:15:10,722 --> 01:15:14,249
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}All he could think about was that he was looking at something...

2198
01:15:10,722 --> 01:15:14,249
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他能想到的却只是眼前这个生命...

2199
01:15:14,459 --> 01:15:16,484
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...that was gonna die someday.

2200
01:15:14,459 --> 01:15:16,484
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...总有一天会死去

2201
01:15:16,828 --> 01:15:18,921
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}He couldn't get it out of his head.

2202
01:15:16,828 --> 01:15:18,921
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他无法驱散这个念头

2203
01:15:19,664 --> 01:15:23,259
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And I think that's so true. Everything is so finite.

2204
01:15:19,664 --> 01:15:23,259
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我觉得很真实,一切事物都是有限的

2205
01:15:23,535 --> 01:15:26,299
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But don't you think that's what...

2206
01:15:23,535 --> 01:15:26,299
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你是否觉得正因为这样...

2207
01:15:26,505 --> 01:15:29,838
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...makes our time and specific moments so important?

2208
01:15:26,505 --> 01:15:29,838
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...才使我们的时间和特殊时刻如此重要?

2209
01:15:30,042 --> 01:15:30,906
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, I know.

2210
01:15:30,042 --> 01:15:30,906
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是的,我明白

2211
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:33,437
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's the same for us tonight, though.

2212
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:33,437
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}就象我们今晚一样

2213
01:15:36,415 --> 01:15:40,078
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}After tomorrow, we'll probably never see each other again, right?

2214
01:15:36,415 --> 01:15:40,078
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}过了明天,我们也许永远都不会再见面

2215
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:44,215
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You don't think we'll ever see each other?

2216
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:44,215
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你不认为我们还能见面?

2217
01:15:46,892 --> 01:15:48,154
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What do you think?

2218
01:15:46,892 --> 01:15:48,154
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你觉得呢?

2219
01:15:54,499 --> 01:15:56,023
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Actually, I don't know.

2220
01:15:54,499 --> 01:15:56,023
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}老实说,我不知道

2221
01:15:57,102 --> 01:15:58,330
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I hadn't planned another--

2222
01:15:57,102 --> 01:15:58,330
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我没有别的计划

2223
01:15:58,537 --> 01:16:02,098
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Me too. I live in Paris, you live in the U.S. I understand.

2224
01:15:58,537 --> 01:16:02,098
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我也是,我在巴黎,你在美国,我能理解

2225
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:05,071
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'd hate to make you fly. You'd hate to fly, right?

2226
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:05,071
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我不想让你来,你讨厌飞行不是吗?

2227
01:16:05,444 --> 01:16:07,503
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'm not so scared of flying.

2228
01:16:05,444 --> 01:16:07,503
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我并不那么害怕飞行

2229
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:09,404
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I mean, I could.

2230
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:09,404
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我是说我可以

2231
01:16:09,614 --> 01:16:11,309
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Well, if you were gonna...

2232
01:16:09,614 --> 01:16:11,309
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是吗,如果你想...

2233
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:13,107
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...come to the U.S...

2234
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:13,107
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...来美国...

2235
01:16:13,351 --> 01:16:14,750
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...or if, you know, if l....

2236
01:16:13,351 --> 01:16:14,750
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...或者,也许我...

2237
01:16:14,953 --> 01:16:17,387
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I mean, I could come back here.

2238
01:16:14,953 --> 01:16:17,387
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我是说,我可以再来这

2239
01:16:18,457 --> 01:16:19,617
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What?

2240
01:16:18,457 --> 01:16:19,617
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}怎么了?

2241
01:16:20,459 --> 01:16:23,690
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}No, let's just be rational adults about this.

2242
01:16:20,459 --> 01:16:23,690
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们该以成年人的理性来对待这事

2243
01:16:26,631 --> 01:16:28,326
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}We should try something different.

2244
01:16:26,631 --> 01:16:28,326
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们该尝试不同的方式

2245
01:16:28,533 --> 01:16:31,764
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's not so bad if tonight is our only night, right?

2246
01:16:28,533 --> 01:16:31,764
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}就算今晚是我们仅有的一晚也不错不是吗?

2247
01:16:33,071 --> 01:16:34,971
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}People exchange numbers, addresses.

2248
01:16:33,071 --> 01:16:34,971
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}大家交换电话,住址

2249
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:38,006
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}They end up writing once, calling each other twice.

2250
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:38,006
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}结果只通过一两封信,一两次电话

2251
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:39,973
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Right. Fizzles out.

2252
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:39,973
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是的,结果很糟

2253
01:16:40,278 --> 01:16:42,769
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, I don't want that. I hate that.

2254
01:16:40,278 --> 01:16:42,769
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我不想那样,我讨厌那样

2255
01:16:43,782 --> 01:16:45,374
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I hate that too.

2256
01:16:43,782 --> 01:16:45,374
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我也讨厌那样

2257
01:16:45,984 --> 01:16:49,283
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Why does everybody think relationships should last forever?

2258
01:16:45,984 --> 01:16:49,283
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}为什么大家都认为关系应该永远保持呢?

2259
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:51,614
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Yeah, why? It's stupid.

2260
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:51,614
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是啊,为什么?真蠢

2261
01:16:53,425 --> 01:16:56,019
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But you think tonight's it?

2262
01:16:53,425 --> 01:16:56,019
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你觉得今晚就是...

2263
01:16:56,294 --> 01:16:59,786
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I mean, that tonight's our only night?

2264
01:16:56,294 --> 01:16:59,786
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我是指,这就是我们仅有的一晚吗?

2265
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,859
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's the only way, no?

2266
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,859
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}只能这样不是吗?

2267
01:17:06,972 --> 01:17:08,303
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Well, all right.

2268
01:17:06,972 --> 01:17:08,303
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那好吧

2269
01:17:09,841 --> 01:17:11,103
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Let's do it.

2270
01:17:09,841 --> 01:17:11,103
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}就这样

2271
01:17:11,443 --> 01:17:13,775
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}No delusions, no projections.

2272
01:17:11,443 --> 01:17:13,775
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不欺骗,不猜忌

2273
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:17,171
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}We'll just make tonight great.

2274
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:17,171
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}只管把今晚过好

2275
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,079
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Let's do that.

2276
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,079
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}好,就这么办

2277
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,800
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}We should do some kind of handshake.

2278
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,800
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们应该握握手

2279
01:17:41,273 --> 01:17:42,535
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Give me your hand.

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}把手给我

2281
01:17:46,011 --> 01:17:48,946
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}To our one and only...

2282
01:17:46,011 --> 01:17:48,946
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}为了我们唯一一个...

2283
01:17:49,781 --> 01:17:51,271
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...night together...

2284
01:17:49,781 --> 01:17:51,271
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...共处的夜晚...

2285
01:17:52,017 --> 01:17:54,577
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and the hours that remain.

2286
01:17:52,017 --> 01:17:54,577
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...以及余下的时间

2287
01:18:03,195 --> 01:18:04,219
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What?

2288
01:18:03,195 --> 01:18:04,219
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}怎么了?

2289
01:18:07,032 --> 01:18:08,329
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's just....

2290
01:18:07,032 --> 01:18:08,329
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这真是...

2291
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:10,497
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's depressing, no?

2292
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:10,497
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}令人沮丧是不是?

2293
01:18:11,503 --> 01:18:14,267
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Now, the only thing we're gonna think of is...

2294
01:18:11,503 --> 01:18:14,267
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}此刻我们唯一要想的就是...

2295
01:18:14,472 --> 01:18:16,406
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...when we'll have to say goodbye.

2296
01:18:14,472 --> 01:18:16,406
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...我们必须说再见的时刻

2297
01:18:17,209 --> 01:18:20,201
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}We could say goodbye now. Then we won't worry about it.

2298
01:18:17,209 --> 01:18:20,201
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}可以现在就说,那样就不用担心了

2299
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:21,738
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Now?

2300
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:21,738
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}现在?

2301
01:18:22,547 --> 01:18:23,707
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Say goodbye.

2302
01:18:22,547 --> 01:18:23,707
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}说再见

2303
01:18:23,915 --> 01:18:25,405
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Bye. -Goodbye.

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这样好了

2311
01:19:01,519 --> 01:19:04,818
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You're gonna grab the glasses, and I'm gonna get the wine.

2312
01:19:01,519 --> 01:19:04,818
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你去偷杯子,我去弄酒

01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:07,018
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Red wine. -Red wine. Right.

2314

2317
01:19:15,166 --> 01:19:17,430
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Wish me luck. -Good luck.

2318
01:19:15,166 --> 01:19:17,430

2321
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,307
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Do you speak English?

2322
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,307
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你会说英语吗?

2323
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:28,570
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-A bit. -Yeah? A bit?

2324

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-会一点 -会一点是吗?

2325
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:31,408
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'm having kind of an odd situation...

2326
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:31,408
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我有件棘手的事...

2327
01:19:31,616 --> 01:19:33,413
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...which is that....

2328
01:19:31,616 --> 01:19:33,413
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...是这样....

2329

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You see that girl over there?

2330
01:19:33,752 --> 01:19:35,686
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}看到那边那女孩了吗?

2331
01:19:40,091 --> 01:19:42,559
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Well, this is our only night together...

2332
01:19:40,091 --> 01:19:42,559
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这是我们在一起的唯一一晚

2333
01:19:43,228 --> 01:19:44,752
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and she....

2334
01:19:43,228 --> 01:19:44,752
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...而她...

2335
01:19:46,831 --> 01:19:50,130
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}The problem is that she wants a bottle of red wine...

2336
01:19:46,831 --> 01:19:50,130
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}问题在于她想要瓶红酒...

2337
01:19:50,335 --> 01:19:52,496
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...and I don't have any money.

2338
01:19:50,335 --> 01:19:52,496
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...可是我身无分文

2339
01:19:54,906 --> 01:19:57,374
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But I was thinking that you might want to...

2340
01:19:54,906 --> 01:19:57,374
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我想你也许能...

2341
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:01,971
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...give me the address of this bar, and I would promise...

2342
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:01,971
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...给我这家酒吧的地址,我保证...

2343
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:05,816
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...to send you the money, and you'd be making our night complete.

2344
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:05,816
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...寄钱给你,而你能成全我们这一夜

2345
01:20:06,017 --> 01:20:07,951
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You would send me the money?

2346
01:20:06,017 --> 01:20:07,951
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-你会寄钱给我? -是的

2347
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:15,321
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Your hand?

2348
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:15,321
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你保证?

2349
01:20:31,509 --> 01:20:33,875
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}For the greatest night in your life.

2350
01:20:31,509 --> 01:20:33,875
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}敬你一生中最美好的夜晚

2351
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:35,774
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Thank you very much.

2352
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:35,774
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}太感谢你了

2353
01:20:59,471 --> 01:21:03,066
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}So often I've been with people and shared beautiful moments...

2354
01:20:59,471 --> 01:21:03,066
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我经常和别人一起分享美好时刻...

2355
01:21:03,274 --> 01:21:07,335
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...like traveling or staying up all night and watching the sunrise.

2356
01:21:03,274 --> 01:21:07,335
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...例如旅游或彻夜不眠等着看日出

2357
01:21:08,213 --> 01:21:10,773
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And I knew those were special moments.

2358
01:21:08,213 --> 01:21:10,773
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我知道那都是特别的时刻

2359
01:21:11,383 --> 01:21:13,613
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But something was always wrong.

2360
01:21:11,383 --> 01:21:13,613
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但总有不如意的地方

2361
01:21:14,753 --> 01:21:16,983
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I wished I'd been with someone else.

2362
01:21:14,753 --> 01:21:16,983
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我希望是和另外的人在一起

2363
01:21:18,757 --> 01:21:20,918
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I knew that what I was feeling...

2364
01:21:18,757 --> 01:21:20,918
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我知道那种感觉...

2365
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:25,187
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...exactly what was so important to me, they didn't understand.

2366
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:25,187
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...实际上对我很重要,他们不会明白

2367
01:21:29,868 --> 01:21:31,859
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But I'm happy to be with you.

2368
01:21:29,868 --> 01:21:31,859
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但我很高兴和你在一起

2369
01:21:34,606 --> 01:21:37,074
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You couldn't know why a night like this...

2370
01:21:34,606 --> 01:21:37,074
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你不会知道为什么这样一夜...

2371
01:21:37,275 --> 01:21:39,766
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...is so important to my life right now...

2372
01:21:37,275 --> 01:21:39,766
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...对我的生活来说有多重要

2373
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:41,377
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...but it is.

2374
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:41,377
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...但确实重要

2375
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:46,450
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}This is a great morning.

2376
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:46,450
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这是个美妙的早晨

2377
01:21:47,018 --> 01:21:48,781
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It is a great morning.

2378
01:21:47,018 --> 01:21:48,781
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是个美妙的早晨

2379
01:21:51,089 --> 01:21:53,387
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Do you think we have others like this?

2380
01:21:51,089 --> 01:21:53,387
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你觉得我们可以更进一步吗?

2381
01:21:56,361 --> 01:21:59,489
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What about our rational, adult decision?

2382
01:21:56,361 --> 01:21:59,489
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那我们的理性和成年人的决定怎么办?

2383
01:21:59,697 --> 01:22:01,358
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Oh, yeah.

2384
01:21:59,697 --> 01:22:01,358
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}哦，嗯

2385
01:22:05,737 --> 01:22:08,968
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I know what you mean about wishing somebody wasn't there.

2386
01:22:05,737 --> 01:22:08,968
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我明白你说的 希望的人不在是指什么

2387
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:11,942
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's just, usually, it's myself...

2388
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:11,942
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}通常,我自己...

2389
01:22:12,143 --> 01:22:14,304
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...that I wish I could get away from.

2390
01:22:12,143 --> 01:22:14,304
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...会希望可以远远躲开

2391
01:22:14,946 --> 01:22:16,846
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Seriously, think about this.

2392
01:22:14,946 --> 01:22:16,846
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}说真的,想想看

2393
01:22:17,348 --> 01:22:19,578
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I have never been anywhere...

2394
01:22:17,348 --> 01:22:19,578
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我从没去过任何...

2395
01:22:19,784 --> 01:22:21,479
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...that I haven't been.

2396
01:22:19,784 --> 01:22:21,479
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...我没去过的地方

2397
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,352
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I've never had a kiss...

2398
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,352
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}从没有一个吻...

2399
01:22:24,556 --> 01:22:26,581
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...when I wasn't one of the kissers.

2400
01:22:24,556 --> 01:22:26,581
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...是我没有吻过的

2401
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:28,656
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You know, I've never...

2402
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:28,656
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}从没有...

2403
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:32,091
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...gone to the movies when I wasn't there in the audience.

2404
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:32,091
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...看过我不在场时看过的电影

2405
01:22:32,297 --> 01:22:34,891
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I've never been out bowling if I wasn't there...

2406
01:22:32,297 --> 01:22:34,891
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}从没打过我没参与的保龄球

2407
01:22:35,099 --> 01:22:36,657
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...making some stupid joke.

2408
01:22:35,099 --> 01:22:36,657
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...制造一些愚蠢的笑话

2409
01:22:36,868 --> 01:22:39,769
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}That's why so many people hate themselves. Seriously.

2410
01:22:36,868 --> 01:22:39,769
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}所以才会有那么多人讨厌自己,真的

2411
01:22:39,971 --> 01:22:42,098
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's just, they are sick to death...

2412
01:22:39,971 --> 01:22:42,098
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}他们渴望死亡...

2413
01:22:42,307 --> 01:22:44,571
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...of being around themselves.

2414
01:22:42,307 --> 01:22:44,571
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...徘徊在自己周围

2415
01:22:45,343 --> 01:22:49,040
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Let's say that you and l were together all the time.

2416
01:22:45,343 --> 01:22:49,040
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}如果我们一直呆在一起

2417
01:22:49,247 --> 01:22:51,477
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You'd start to hate a lot of my mannerisms.

2418
01:22:49,247 --> 01:22:51,477
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你会开始讨厌我的坏习惯

2419
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:53,414
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}The way...

2420
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:53,414
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}包括...

2421
01:22:53,618 --> 01:22:56,849
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...the way every time that we would have people over...

2422
01:22:53,618 --> 01:22:56,849
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...每次我们有客人来访...

2423
01:22:57,455 --> 01:23:00,686
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...I'd be insecure, and I'd get a little too drunk.

2424
01:22:57,455 --> 01:23:00,686
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...我变得不可靠,我喝过了头

2425
01:23:01,493 --> 01:23:05,259
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Or the way I tell the same stupid, pseudo-intellectual story...

2426
01:23:01,493 --> 01:23:05,259
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}或是我反复讲些愚蠢,自作聪明的故事...

2427
01:23:05,463 --> 01:23:07,226
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...again and again.

2428
01:23:05,463 --> 01:23:07,226
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...翻来覆去地说...

2429
01:23:08,967 --> 01:23:11,128
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You see, I've heard all those stories...

2430
01:23:08,967 --> 01:23:11,128
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那些故事我都听过...

2431
01:23:11,402 --> 01:23:14,030
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...so of course I'm sick of myself.

2432
01:23:11,402 --> 01:23:14,030
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...所以我当然会厌恶自己

2433
01:23:18,176 --> 01:23:19,666
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}But being with you...

2434
01:23:18,176 --> 01:23:19,666
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但和你在一起...

2435
01:23:21,913 --> 01:23:24,575
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...it's made me feel like I was somebody else.

2436
01:23:21,913 --> 01:23:24,575
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...让我觉得自己象是另一个人

2437
01:23:26,184 --> 01:23:30,280
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I mean, the only other way to lose yourself like that is...

2438
01:23:26,184 --> 01:23:30,280
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}象这样能让人忘我的其他方法只有...

2439
01:23:31,155 --> 01:23:33,385
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...you know, dancing...

2440
01:23:31,155 --> 01:23:33,385
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...你也知道,跳舞...

2441
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:35,692
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...or alcohol...

2442
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:35,692
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...酒精...

2443
01:23:36,327 --> 01:23:39,194
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...or drugs, or stuff like that.

2444
01:23:36,327 --> 01:23:39,194
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...毒品,诸如此类

2445
01:23:41,733 --> 01:23:42,995
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Fucking.

2446
01:23:41,733 --> 01:23:42,995
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}做爱?

2447
01:23:44,235 --> 01:23:47,398
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Fucking, yeah. That's one way.

2448
01:23:44,235 --> 01:23:47,398
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}作爱,对,也是方法之一

2449
01:24:01,753 --> 01:24:03,516
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Do you know what I want?

2450
01:24:01,753 --> 01:24:03,516
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}知道我想要什么吗?

2451
01:24:04,722 --> 01:24:06,019
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What?

2452
01:24:04,722 --> 01:24:06,019
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}什么?

2453
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,952
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}To be kissed.

2454
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,952
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}有人吻我

2455
01:24:14,265 --> 01:24:15,892
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Well, I could do that.

2456
01:24:14,265 --> 01:24:15,892
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}这我能做到

2457
01:24:29,881 --> 01:24:30,939
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Wait.

2458
01:24:29,881 --> 01:24:30,939
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}等等

2459
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,185
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I have to say something stupid.

2460
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,185
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我得说几句傻话

2461
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:39,847
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}All right.

2462
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:39,847
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}没问题

2463
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:42,953
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}It's very stupid.

2464
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:42,953
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}非常傻

2465
01:24:46,097 --> 01:24:48,258
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I don't think we should sleep together.

2466
01:24:46,097 --> 01:24:48,258
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我觉得我们不该发生关系

2467
01:24:50,602 --> 01:24:55,062
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I want to, but since we're never going to see each other again...

2468
01:24:50,602 --> 01:24:55,062
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我很想,但以后我们永远都不会再见面

2469
01:24:55,273 --> 01:24:57,173
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...it'll make me feel bad.

2470
01:24:55,273 --> 01:24:57,173
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...这让我很难受

2471
01:24:58,076 --> 01:25:00,806
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I'll wonder who else you're with. I'll miss you.

2472
01:24:58,076 --> 01:25:00,806
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我会猜你和谁在一起,会想你

2473
01:25:06,217 --> 01:25:08,685
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I know. It's not very adult.

2474
01:25:06,217 --> 01:25:08,685
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我知道,这不太成熟

2475
01:25:08,886 --> 01:25:11,753
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Maybe it's a female thing. I can't help it.

2476
01:25:08,886 --> 01:25:11,753
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}也许是女人的天性,我控制不住

2477
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:14,121
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Let's see each other again.

2478
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:14,121
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}那我们就再见面

2479
01:25:16,861 --> 01:25:20,854
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}No, I don't want you to break our vow just so you can get laid.

2480
01:25:16,861 --> 01:25:20,854
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我不希望你为了和我作爱而破坏约定

2481
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:25,335
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I don't want to just get laid. I want to-- I mean....

2482
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:25,335
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我不只是想,而是--我是说...

2483
01:25:25,803 --> 01:25:27,964
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I mean, I think we should.

2484
01:25:25,803 --> 01:25:27,964
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我觉得我们应该作爱

2485
01:25:29,073 --> 01:25:31,234
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}We die in the morning, right?

2486
01:25:29,073 --> 01:25:31,234
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们早上就会死去不是吗?

2487
01:25:32,644 --> 01:25:35,579
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-I think we should. -Then it's like some male fantasy.

2488
01:25:32,644 --> 01:25:35,579
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-所以应该 -那就象男人的梦想

2489
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:38,977
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Meet a French girl, fuck her and never see her again.

2490
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:38,977
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}邂逅一个法国女郎,干了她然后永不再见

2491
01:25:39,183 --> 01:25:42,778
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}And have this great story to tell. I don't want...

2492
01:25:39,183 --> 01:25:42,778
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}而且有个好故事可说了,我可不想...

2493
01:25:42,987 --> 01:25:45,717
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...this great evening to just have been for that.

2494
01:25:42,987 --> 01:25:45,717
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...这个美好的夜晚变成那样

2495
01:25:46,557 --> 01:25:50,084
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Okay, we don't have to have sex. It's not a big deal.

2496
01:25:46,557 --> 01:25:50,084
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}好的,我们不用作爱,那没什么大不了

2497
01:26:00,972 --> 01:26:02,940
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You don't want to see me again?

2498
01:26:00,972 --> 01:26:02,940
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你不想再见到我?

2499
01:26:04,375 --> 01:26:05,637
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}No, of course I do.

2500
01:26:04,375 --> 01:26:05,637
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不,我当然想

2501
01:26:05,843 --> 01:26:08,437
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}If somebody gave me the choice right now...

2502
01:26:05,843 --> 01:26:08,437
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}如果现在有人让我选择...

2503
01:26:08,646 --> 01:26:11,547
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...of to never see you again or to marry you...

2504
01:26:08,646 --> 01:26:11,547
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...永远不再见你还是娶你

2505
01:26:11,783 --> 01:26:12,875
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...I would marry you.

2506
01:26:11,783 --> 01:26:12,875
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...我会娶你

2507
01:26:13,084 --> 01:26:15,245
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Maybe that's a lot of romantic bullshit...

2508
01:26:13,084 --> 01:26:15,245
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}也许是所谓的浪漫过头

2509
01:26:15,453 --> 01:26:18,183
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...but people have gotten married for a lot less.

2510
01:26:15,453 --> 01:26:18,183
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}但有人结婚的理由比这更少

2511
01:26:21,626 --> 01:26:22,456
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Actually...

2512
01:26:21,626 --> 01:26:22,456
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}事实上...

2513
01:26:24,462 --> 01:26:29,195
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...I think I decided I wanted to sleep with you when we got off the train.

2514
01:26:24,462 --> 01:26:29,195
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...我们下火车时我决定要和你睡觉

2515
01:26:32,837 --> 01:26:35,738
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Now that we've talked so much, I don't know anymore.

2516
01:26:32,837 --> 01:26:35,738
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}聊了这么多之后我拿不定主意了

2517
01:26:46,584 --> 01:26:48,916
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Why do we make everything so complicated?

2518
01:26:46,584 --> 01:26:48,916
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们干嘛把一切变得这么复杂?

2519
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,610
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I don't know.

2520
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:50,610
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我不知道

2521
01:27:52,416 --> 01:27:56,147
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What's the first thing you'll do when you get back to Paris?

2522
01:27:52,416 --> 01:27:56,147
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}回到巴黎你首先想要做什么?

2523
01:27:56,621 --> 01:27:58,179
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Call my parents.

2524
01:27:56,621 --> 01:27:58,179
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}给父母打电话

2525
01:27:58,422 --> 01:27:59,787
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What about you?

2526
01:27:58,422 --> 01:27:59,787
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你呢?

2527
01:28:00,124 --> 01:28:04,254
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I don't know. I'll probably go pick up my dog. He's with a friend.

2528
01:28:00,124 --> 01:28:04,254
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}不知道,也许会去拿狗,它在我朋友那

2529
01:28:04,462 --> 01:28:05,895
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}You have a dog? I love dogs.

2530
01:28:04,462 --> 01:28:05,895
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}你有只狗?我喜欢狗

2531
01:28:06,097 --> 01:28:07,724
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-You do? -Yeah.

2532

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-是吗? -是的

2533
01:28:08,065 --> 01:28:09,965
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}-Oh, shit. -What?

2534
01:28:08,065 --> 01:28:09,965
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}-哦,该死 -怎么了?

2535
01:28:11,002 --> 01:28:13,562
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I don't know. We're back in real time.

2536
01:28:11,002 --> 01:28:13,562
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}说不清,我们回到现实中来了

2537
01:28:13,971 --> 01:28:15,666
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}I know. I hate that.

2538

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是的,令我讨厌

2539
01:28:16,007 --> 01:28:17,304
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}What is that?

2540
01:28:16,007 --> 01:28:17,304
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}是什么?

2541
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:21,402
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Sounds like a harpsichord.

2542
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:21,402
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}听起来象古钢琴

2543

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Check that out.

01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:54,340
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Can we dance to the harpsichord?

2550
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:54,340
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}我们能随着琴声起舞吗?

2551
01:28:54,545 --> 01:28:55,910
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}Of course.

{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&H8B4A14&\b0}...or all this.

2560
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:13,692
{\fn宋体\fs12\bord1\2c&HFFFFFF&\3c&HFF9933&\b0}...和这一切
