1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,290
<i>Air and naval forces of the United States</i>

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,180
<i>launched a series of strikes against terrorist facilities...</i>

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,630
<i>Pan Am flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,970
<i>He has sanctioned acts of terror</i> <i>in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.</i>

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,940
<i>This will not stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,800
<i>This relentless pursuit of terror.</i>

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,950
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

8
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,770
<i>The USS Cole was attacked</i> <i>while refueling in the port of Aden.</i>

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,290
This was an act of terrorism.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,510
It was a despicable and cowardly act.

11
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,430
<i>The next samba we're going to swing for you</i> is one of the good old favorites.

12
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,030
...until something stops him.

13
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,820
<i>It was right in front of my eyes,</i>

14
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,450
<i>and I never saw it coming.</i>

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,970
<i>That plane crashed into the World Trade Center.</i>

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,720
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

17
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,590
We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad.

18
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,940
<i>You're the smartest and the dumbest fucking person</i> <i>I've ever known.</i>

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,580
<i>I'm not the one who got it wrong.</i> <i>I'm the only one who got it right.</i>

20
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,730
<i>Take 'em.</i>

21
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,990
<i>Take 'em all.</i>

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,610
<i>Previously on Homeland...</i>

23
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,860
I'm an associate at Bennett, Parr and Hamilton.

24
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,420
One of our partners would like to meet with you. Miss Mathison, Leland Bennett.

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,520
What does your client want? To pick your brain from time to time.

26
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,810
Put you on retainer as it were.

27
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,880
No sound.

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,110
Take it off.

29
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,320
Carrie Mathison.

30
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,520
It's time we talk about Nasser Hejazi.

31
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,280
Whose name you used to embezzle more than $45 million.

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,600
You are now an enemy of your own state.

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,110
I got plans for you. What plans?

34
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,720
I'm gonna play you back into Iran. From now on you work for us.

35
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,690
For me.

36
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,420
I've recruited a high-level Iranian asset. Majid Javadi.

37
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,120
The man who financed the bombing of the CIA?

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,400
We talked about this.

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,320
The need to wean you of your cold war bullshit.

40
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,220
This is a once in a lifetime operation that can transform everything.

41
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,650
The entire Middle East. You sound like you're fucking high.

42
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,780
I need to know something before you leave. I need to know...

43
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,710
who's responsible for the bomb?

44
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,410
<i>You know what he asked me?</i>
Who moved the bomb?

45
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,930
If it was Brody. Now, why would he ask me that?

46
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,520
That implies that there's a difference of opinion on that subject.

47
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,940
You should know that the man who built the bomb and moved the SUV,

48
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,160
he didn't die in the explosion like they say.

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,060
As far as I know, he's still in this country. Where?

50
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,020
I don't know.
Who does?

51
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,200
The man that brought us together. Your lawyer? Bennett?

52

Fuck!

56
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,220
What happened to you?

57
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,070
I started to get worried. I'm out of practice.

58
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,280
Well...

59
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,060
this looks delicious, Saul.

60
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,090
Thank you.

61
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,630
Can I pour you a cup of tea? Please.

62
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,920
Where did you get these from?

63
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,430
Aren't these the mugs we brought back from the Philippines?

64
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,730
The very last pair.

65
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,190
When this is all over,

66
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,770
I'd like to go back to that island on the Sulu Sea.

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,510
You know, you don't have to promise anything.

68
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,500
Really. I understand.

69
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,520
No, I don't see why not.
We might actually have fun.

70
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,850
Well, the evidence does seem to indicate that that is possible

71
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,770
after all.

72
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,740
Is there any chance

73
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,870
that you could stay home today?

74
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,790
There's nothing I'd rather do.

75
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,470
But?

76
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,420
I got a meeting with Mike Higgins this morning at the White House.

77
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,050
- When? - 9:30.

78
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,970
Well, that gives us an hour and a half...

79
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,230
by my count.

80
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,880
Yes, it does.

81
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,030
Okay, here's something.

82
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,970
Dr. Maximillian Aziz, Jordanian,

83
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,630
was actually in the auditorium the time the bomb went off.

84
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,370
Ops or Intelligence? Intelligence- Office of Transnational Issues.

85
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,760
And what's his connection to Leland Bennett?

86
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,670
He wrote a lengthy analysis of the firm's hip-pocket clients.

87
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,310
Iran, Syria, Azerbaijan. This was two years ago.

88
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,740
It hardly fits the profile.

89
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,980
Any munitions training? Experience with explosives?

90
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,450
Uh... no.

91
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,730
All right, add him to the list anyway. Yeah, which begs the question-

92
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,080
are we even sure that the guy who made the bomb moved Brody's car?

93
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,490
- Depends. - On what?

94
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,200
On whether or not you believe Javadi.

95
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,550
- Which you do. - Which I do.

96
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,830
But it takes more than an opinion to put it in front of Saul.

97
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,530
Right.

98
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,560
You know, I can't help but feel we're spinning our wheels here.

99
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
The FBI have been through these files a hundred times.

100
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,570
Anybody that was at Langley that day has been turned inside-out and upside-down.

101
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,010
Yeah, well, someone who was at Langley that day did the bombing.

102
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,460
I still can't believe all these people are gone.

103
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,690
Yeah.

104
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,460
Where's Fara anyway? She was supposed to be here over an hour ago.

105
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,700
TOP
SECRET

106
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,810
- Come on in, Saul. - Hey, Mike.

107
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,790
Good to see you.

108
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,880
Senator?

109
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,290
Yeah.

110
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,760
The Senator's made some serious allegations.

111
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,830
Which are?

112
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,060
That you had Majid Javadi in a safe house,

113
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,090
on American soil and let him go.

114
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,070
Do you contest that?

115
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,220
Yes and no. What's the yes?

116
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,610
I'm not aware of any standing order to arrest Colonel Javadi.

117
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,930
- Did you have him in custody or not? - I did.

118
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,730
Aw, Jesus fucking Christ, Saul. We didn't just "Let him go," Mike.

119
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,050
We debriefed him. Turned him.

120
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,250
Sent him back to Iran. You turned him?

121
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,660
He's ours. With no guarantee that he'll actually cooperate.

122
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,430
- He will. - How do you know?

123
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,570
Because I know the man. Because he knows the game.

124
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,420
That is total speculation. He's right.

125
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,750
We haven't had a whole lot of success - in that department lately. - Well, we have now.

126
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,970
Javadi's the highest placed CIA asset in the history of the Agency.

127
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,280
He ordered and financed the attack on Langley.

128
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,440
All the better if he did. He's above suspicion.

129
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,610
A high-profile arrest would've sent a clear message to the Mullahs.

130
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,350
Back the fuck down.

131
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:38,040
Instead we have a live source, keeping us current on Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon,

132
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,780
on Hezbollah operations all over the globe.

133
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,240
How come I never saw a finding on this? We were responding to events on the ground.

134
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,070
The call had to be made in real time.

135
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,650
That is horseshit, and he knows it.

136
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,530
Mike, I think it's time you excuse the Senator.

137
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,910
What are you talking about?

138
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,250
I called this meeting to brief the Chief of Staff on the second phase of the mission.

139
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,250
- So, go ahead. - I can't.

140
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,540
- Not with you present. - Why not?

141
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,680
Because your security clearance is one level below operational.

142
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,320
You see what I'm dealing with?

143
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,430
The man is out of hand and out of control.

144
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,120
And in this case, he's correct. I'm sorry, Senator.

145
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,310
Mike, in nine days, I'm the next DCI.

146
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,800
And in nine days, Saul will brief you on whatever you need to know.

147
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,320
- But not until then. - Mike...

148
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,390
Senator.

149
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,120
- Mike? - Senator, please.

150
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,550
Goddamn it, Saul.

151
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,240
I spent the last month and a half arranging a marriage between you two.

152
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,050
I'm out, I know that.

153
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,160
You are now. You didn't need to be.

154
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,800
Javadi was worth it.

155
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,870
All right, tell me about this phase two.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,380
Regime change?

157
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,080
Eventually. We're setting the stage.

158
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,600
How?

159
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,970
First we move Javadi up the chain of command into a senior military position.

160
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,420
How?! Keep reading.

161
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,540
Sorry I'm late.

162
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,650
Traffic.

163
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,520
I ordered you a macchiato, but it's probably cold by now.

164
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,620
Thank you.

165
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,450
It's fine.

166
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,010
So I got your text. Everything okay?

167
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:03,980
Yes.

168
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,570
No.

169
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,190
It's... Saul.

170
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,750
What about him?

171
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,120
We've made a decision. Well, I-I've made a decision.

172
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,600
To give the marriage another chance.

173
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,650
I...

174
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,040
You have to know, it's not easy for me.

175
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,450
And when, uh, did you decide all this?

176
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,690
Last night.

177
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,260
Forgive me, but didn't we just spend yesterday in a suite

178
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,740
at the Ritz Carlton?

179
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,700
What's changed?

180
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,270
I- I just told you.

181
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,040
What, suddenly Saul and you have decided to reconcile?

182
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,720
It's not suddenly.

183
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,250
We've been talking about it for the last two months. You know that.

184
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,240
Well, I was under the impression that you had given up on that.

185
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,200
That you both had. Well, I don't know, maybe we had.

186
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,020
Then there's something you're not telling me.

187
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,030
- We've been married 35 years. - I love you.

188
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,490
Don't say that. I love making love to you.

189
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,720
- I have to go. - Mira...

190
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,500
Good-bye.

191
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,370
He signed off? Well, let's put it this way-

192
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,890
he sees the merits of the operation. So he's taking it to the President?

193
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,650
- Yes. - Merits?

194
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:44,310
Saul, it's fucking genius. If we can pull it off.

195
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,370
- When are you leaving? - Tomorrow morning.

196
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,800
Does Carrie know you're going? She can't even suspect it.

197
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,590
Heard you were looking for me.

198
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,280
Yeah, we were just going over the transcript of your debrief with Javadi

199
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,900
to see if it supported what he told Carrie - on the tarmac yesterday. - Which was?

200
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,140
That the man who moved the SUV is still in the United States,

201
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,670
and he's somehow connected to Leland Bennett's law firm.

202
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,620
- Connected how? - It's unclear.

203
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,030
We were hoping you could shed some light. Javadi didn't mention the Bennett connection.

204
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,250
Well, what about Brody? Did he mention Brody?

205
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,510
In what context?

206
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,300
In the context of being the bomber.

207
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,240
Not in so many words, he didn't. Well, what did he say?

208
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,800
He said as far as he knows, Brody didn't move the car.

209
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,580
As far as he knows?

210
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,360
That's not what he told me.

211
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,060
- Okay. - He told me definitively it wasn't Brody.

212
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,960
What's your point? Why would he tell us two different stories?

213
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,950
Is that a question or an accusation?

214
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,470
Well, I guess I'd like a straight answer.

215
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,540
And if Javadi even intimated that Brody didn't move the car, why not press him on who did?

216
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,240
Well, you're angry because I didn't share a conversation with you about Brody.

217
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,890
An inconclusive one.

218
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:55,080
No, I'm angry because you seem entirely indifferent to catching the actual bomber.

219
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,990
Speak for yourself. I'm all for it. Well, I'm glad to hear it.

220
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,230
So... you two... actually have a plan?

221
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,990
Yeah. Yeah, we want to flush this guy out into the open.

222
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,140
Mm-hmm. How?

223
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,910
You know Leland Bennett personally, right?

224
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,860
We've golfed Congressional a few times together.

225
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,960
And we serve on the board of the Northam Foundation.

226
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,650
How comfortable would you be making an approach?

227
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,950
Comfortable enough.

228
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:03,120
Oh, back already? Yeah, I'm not feeling well.

229
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,650
You can go. I'll look after him today.

230
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,000
You sure? Yeah. How is he?

231
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,590
Oh, sitting up. Progress.

232
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,630
Yeah, slowly but surely.

233
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,010
I'll see you tomorrow.

234
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,260
Feel better. Thanks.

235
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,730
Baba Joon.

236
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,230
I'm staying home today.

237
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,120
Do I need a reason?

238
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,760
I'm not going to lose my job.

239
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,490
Because I'm sure.

240
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,870
Speak English.

241
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,210
English.

242
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,660
I did not come to America to live in the street like a dirty Arab.

243
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,750
Baba... listen to me.

244
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,980
Nothing like that is going to happen. No one's going to throw us out of our home.

245
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,570
Don't worry.

246
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,040
My job's safe.

247
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,380
At the bank?

248
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,490
Yes.

249
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,120
At the investment bank.

250
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,020
If you work at the bank,

251
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,260
why are we not rich?

252
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,030
Richter. That's a German surname. My parents were born in Hamburg.

253
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,680
Do you speak it? <i>Ja nat眉rlich.</i>

254
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,860
That's useful.

255
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,020
We represent three private banking houses in Berlin.

256
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,760
Would you, uh, excuse me for just a moment?

257
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,730
Of course.

258
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,430
You're early.

259
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,210
I'm in the middle of interviewing a new associate. It won't take long.

260
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,680
We missed you at the foundation meeting last week.

261
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,150
Couldn't get there. Work.

262
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,510
You gotta make time for us.

263
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,010
It's not enough that I've raised over a million dollars this quarter?

264
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,730
You know me. Never satisfied.

265
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,610
But... that's not what this is about.

266
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,900
- No? - No.

267
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,160
Sounds ominous.

268
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,020
I do terror now, by the way.

269
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,330
I'm not sure you knew that. I don't think I did.

270
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,320
Your firm's name has come up lately. More than once.

271
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,830
- In what light? - That I can't tell you.

272
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,720
Then why tell me at all?

273
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,610
Because tomorrow morning at exactly 10:00, I walk into a high level,

274
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,770
 top secret meeting at which you are the agenda.

275
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,950
What do you want?

276
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,920
Cooperate with us. Come clean.

277
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,410
Get out in front of what's sure to turn into a...

278
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,740
a bruising investigation.

279
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,710
You know what?

280
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,530
20 years ago, I might've fallen for that weak shit.

281
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,740
But today...

282
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,750
come after me if you want. I've got nothing to hide.

283
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,330
Text
a red wheel barrow.

284
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,710
Who's the candle for?

285
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,210
All the departed.

286
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,500
You Orthodox?

287
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,670
Old boyfriend.

288
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,940
I hear the weddings go on forever.

289
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,990
Longer than the marriages, so goes the joke.

290
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,960
Mr. Bennett needs you to look into something for him.

291
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,290
My arrangement's with Majid Javadi,

292
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,860
not Leland Bennett. Correct.

293
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,630
But what Mr. Bennett heard today might reverberate onto you.

294
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,520
Onto me? Do I need to remind you-

295
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,830
you're a recruited agent of a foreign government?

296
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,010
I met with Javadi. Once.

297
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,480
I agreed to consult with him. I'm nobody's agent.

298
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,140
I doubt the CIA would appreciate the distinction. What the hell do you know about it?

299
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,690
I know the law firm appears to be the target of an inquiry of some kind.

300
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,690
Well, not one that I'm aware of.

301
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,490
The warning was delivered personally,

302
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,420
outside of official channels.

303
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,030
By somebody who works at the Agency?

304
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,690
A longtime acquaintance of Mr. Bennett, yes.

305
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,240
So what do you want from me?

306
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,880
Confirm the report.

307
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,590
Mr. Bennett needs to know what part of the business is under investigation

308
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,030
and what he can do to protect himself.

309
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,290
That's not going to be easy. Not without setting off alarm bells.

310
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,600
You'll figure something out. I'll figure something out?

311
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,560
And obviously there's a clock on this. Obviously.

312
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,640
Hello? It's on.

313
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,360
Tell me. I just met with Franklin.

314
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,710
They're panicking over there. Well, let them.

315
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,160
Wait 24 hours...

316
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,080
then hit them with the news we know who the bomber is.

317
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,210
Will do.

318
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,700
Uh, Saul?

319
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,490
Yeah?

320
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,300
I need some personal time between then and now.

321
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,470
You got it.

322
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,250
- Thanks. - You all right?

323
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,960
Yeah.

324
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,670
I should've shared that intel about Brody with you sooner.

325
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,670
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking. You've been to hell and back.

326
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,610
I know how important this is to you.

327
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,430
I owe you. We all do.

328
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,130
Yeah, well, as long as we get the real bomber...

329
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,160
We will.

330
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,270
Carrie?

331
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,810
Yeah. How'd you know? Tone of your voice.

332
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,840
You don't talk to anyone else like that.

333
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,640
Huh, I wasn't aware. You ready to eat?

334
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,050
Should I open a bottle of wine? That's a great idea.

335
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,150
Listen... I got to go away for a few days.

336
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,090
You do?

337
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,960
- Yeah. - When?

338
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,050
Tomorrow.

339
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,800
Saul... I know.

340
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,930
The timing's not great.

341
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,380
But you said only a couple of days?

342
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,270
Yeah. A week, at the most.

343
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,830
A week?

344
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,700
I wouldn't be going...

345
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,740
if I didn't absolutely have to.

346
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,280
You know what, I could go with you.

347
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,210
- Wouldn't that be great? - Why not?

348
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,860
It's not that kind of trip.

349
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,770
I wish it were.

350
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,370
- Cheers. - Cheers.

351
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,570
To us.

352
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,950
You've been nauseous? Yeah.

353
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,040
Usually that goes away by now.

354
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,490
So I've heard.

355
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,300
I'm getting a real clear image here.

356
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,830
You want to know if it's a boy or a girl?

357
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:22,920
No.

358
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,150
Sorry this is so last-minute. No, no, it's great to see you.

359
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,190
This is quite a surprise.

360
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,080
I saw Maggie at the hospital last week, she didn't say a thing.

361
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,300
She doesn't know.

362
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,690
Does that have anything to do with why you're coming in for your first prenatal exam

363
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,070
13 weeks in?

364
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,200
I didn't exactly plan this.

365
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,870
But you've known for some time.

366
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,950
What about medications? What are you currently taking?

367
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,590
Uh, at the moment, nothing. I see.

368
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,220
I was on 1,800 milligrams of lithium for about a month there.

369
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,640
Things were a little out of control.

370
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,050
And, uh, before that,
there was a lot of drinking.

371
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,080
A... lot.

372
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,630
After you knew?

373
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,880
I haven't been painting a nursery, just put it that way.

374
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,130
Are you telling me you wish to terminate?

375
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,790
I just want to know what the tests say. If things are okay.

376
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,870
Well...

377
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,170
you're iron deficient.

378
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,280
We can fix that. But your blood pressure's very high.

379
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,810
I've been... really stressed at work.

380
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,850
Well, you really should be taking it easy.

381
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,740
Yeah, I'll try.

382
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,280
Carrie, we can manage this. Keep you and the baby healthy.

383
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,560
It's not magic, it's a process.

384
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,710
You want to leave it to chance, that's up to you.

385
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,870
Otherwise you need to modify your behavior.

386
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,840
Not in a week or two, or when it's convenient.

387
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,800
Now.

388
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,270
What I'm doing, it has to do with the father. I need to make some things right.

389
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,480
It matters to a lot of people.

390
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,530
But this is different, Carrie. You're not on your own anymore.

391
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,220
Fara? Sherazi?

392
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,810
And you are? Mitchell Clausen.

393
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,520
From the IG's Office.

394
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,300
IG? Inspector General.

395
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,500
May I come in?

396
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,500
This way.

397
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,130
May I offer you something? I'm good. Um...

398
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,580
you called in sick two days in a row.

399
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,160
Is something the matter? Migraines.

400
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,720
Yet you drove into work yesterday. Yes.

401
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,550
Where you sat in the parking lot for over half an hour before deciding to leave again.

402
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,800
I was hoping the headache would go away.

403
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:29,420
Is that why you then paid a visit to 1426 Longhill Road,

404
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,220
where the recent double murder happened?

405
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,090
The Bethesda PD took down your license number.

406
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:44,020
The Agency had to call in a lot of favors to close that investigation.

407
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,390
Your going over there jeopardized all that.

408
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,940
I wanted to see where it happened.

409
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,810
Why?

410
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:59,710
It upset me. I... I was upset by it.

411
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:07,340
Director Berenson has shown an unusual degree of confidence in you, Ms. Sherazi...

412
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,570
Entrusted you with matters of national importance.

413
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,030
I'm aware of that.

414
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,800
But your current state of mind makes your loyalty to him

415
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,700
and to the Agency a very live issue.

416
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,430
Tell the Director not to worry.

417
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,220
I'm fine. You can tell him yourself.

418
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,050
When you come into work tomorrow.

419
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,620
Yes.

420
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,030
Director Berenson?

421
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,340
Who is this Director Berenson?

422
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,500
My boss.

423
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,850
But he's no banker, is he?

424
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,360
No.

425
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,070
You went ahead, didn't you?

426
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,790
In spite of everything I said?

427
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,920
Baba, an attack happened. So what?

428
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
It's none of your business.

429
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,280
They needed Farsi speakers with experience in international finance.

430
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,740
I had to help.

431
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,730
And when the secret police find out who you work for, what then?

432
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,320
We have family still in Tehran!

433
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,300
Your uncle, his wife and children.

434
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,560
They will be added to the list of those to be hanged,

435
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,180
or shot!

436
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,230
I'm an American.

437
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,820
Target is still unknown, but presumed to be the man

438
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,510
who put the bomb in position in front of the HQ auditorium.

439
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:53,620
This is Paul Franklin, our stalking horse. Carrie?

440
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,540
Later this afternoon, I'll promote misinformation

441
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,160
to Mr. Franklin in the hopes that
he'll lead us to the bomber.

442
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,150
Our assumption is that after the meeting, he'll reach out for instructions.

443
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,500
To this man. Leland Bennett, one of the senior partners at the firm.

444
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,890
Which is why operation, from this moment forward,

445
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:14,430
requires a full complement of audio and visual surveillance on both subjects.

446
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,490
I don't have to tell you what catching this guy would mean.

447
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:21,600
In other words, stay small, stay cool, stay out of sight.

448
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,280
Okay, everybody. Game time.

449
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,370
You were right. Tell me.

450
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,990
They've connected your firm to the guy who detonated the bomb at Langley.

451
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,230
That's not possible. I'm telling you what I found out.

452
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,120
All right. Okay.

453
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:17,900
They're also under the impression that he's still here in the United States.

454
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,390
Is that true?

455
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,000
Answer the question, or so help me, I'll get up and you'll never see me again.

456
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,710
Take it easy, Carrie. Take a breath. No, don't patronize me.

457
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,200
Okay. It's true, he's here.

458
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,780
He's here where?

459
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,650
I'm assuming that means they haven't located him yet.

460
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,010
No, they haven't. Then exactly what do they have?

461
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:49,240
A warrant pending before a FISA judge, naming Leland Bennett a co-conspirator.

462
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,800
How soon before the warrant's active? A few days, at least.

463
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,050
They won't find anything. Bennett's clean. He works through a cutout.

464
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,000
You.

465
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:01,380
Just lay low and let me handle this.

466
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,860
You're the one who's been handling this, so excuse me if your assurance isn't very assuring.

467
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:35,080
They have a line on our friend. How'd they get onto him?

468
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,230
- No idea. - Well, find out.

469
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,730
It's a little late for that, don't you think? You sure it wasn't your mistake?

470
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:43,100
You sure it wasn't yours?

471
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:48,070
We were asked to provide material support to an American citizen with ties to the Regime.

472
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,480
There was no mention of his involvement in the bombing.

473
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,920
There was later. Yes, there was.

474
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,110
Well, we should've dealt with it then.

475
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,210
Maybe.

476
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:04,510
Do they know his name? No.

477
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,800
Then we're still okay. Do you want him out of the country?

478
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,960
Yes.

479
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,300
Preferably with a new identity.

480
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,090
How much do I tell him? I don't care.

481
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,720
Just get him out.

482
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,120
Franklin's sending a text. Talk to me.

483
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,150
It's an address and time.

484
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,550
Fairview Motel in Lynchburg, 0130.

485
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:52,870
Can we trace who he's sending it to? No, there must be an anonymizer on the device.

486
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,240
Don't worry, Carrie.

487
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,560
As long as we stick on Franklin, you'll get your bomber.

488
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,580
He's right.

489
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,410
We'll send a tactical team to the motel.

490
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,380
They'll arrest the target as soon as Franklin clears scene.

491
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,860
DC Department of Transportation is warning drivers to prepare for delays

492
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,400
due to street closures downtown Thursday through Saturday.

493
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,780
Officials say southbound 14th Street Northwest

494
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,130
will be closed between G Street and Pennsylvania.

495
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,840
Here's something.

496
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,810
It could be him.

497
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,870
Yeah, it is him. I've got a visual.

498
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,360
Copy that.

499
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,900
What's he doing? Just sitting there at the moment.

500
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,970
Bravo, do you have eyes on?

501
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:40,040
I'm looking down on the roof of his car.

502
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,180
No one moves until Franklin leaves site.

503
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,510
Copy that.

504
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,010
He's calling someone. We got it.

505
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,130
Are you here? Outside.

506
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,140
Flash your lights.

507
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,680
What room are you in? First tell me what's happening.

508
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,740
You may have been compromised.

509
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,250
How the hell did that happen? It happened.

510
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:32,100
What difference does it make how? Because I'm the one whose life is fucked.

511
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:36,160
If I hadn't gotten to you first, you'd spend the rest of your life living in a cage.

512
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,420
Try on some gratitude. You want your exfil package or not?

513
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,810
2-2-0. Be right up.

514
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,380
Shit. He's got a weapon.

515
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,170
What?

516
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,510
Now he's silencing it. Jesus, you seeing this?

517
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:14,950
He's got a gun! Bravo, can you confirm?

518
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,580
Negative. My view is obscured.

519
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,370
He's not exfiltrating the bomber, he's taking him out. You don't know that, Carrie.

520
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,470
Why else would he have a silencer?

521
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:27,470
She's right, Scott. I make the weapon.

522
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,160
I'm telling you Franklin's gonna kill that guy.

523
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:36,600
Listen to me. We just heard Bennett telling Franklin to get the guy out of the country.

524
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,630
Maybe Bennett changed his mind.

525
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:42,320
Either way, our priority is to keep Franklin in play.

526
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,180
So we just let him kill the bomber? If necessary, yes.

527
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,380
That wasn't the deal.

528
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,030
The bomber's the only way to prove that Brody's innocent.

529
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,730
And stopping Franklin now would blow your cover

530
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,090
and Javadi's back in Tehran.

531
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,260
You get that, right?

532
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,930
Until Franklin is clear, I want all teams to stand down.

533
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,880
All teams, acknowledge standing down.

534
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,670
Bravo here, standing down. Alpha Team standing down.

535
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,160
Carrie, acknowledge.

536
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,150
Carrie?

537
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,510
Carrie, what the fuck are you doing?

538
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:27,340
Carrie, go back to the van! Saul promised me this guy alive.

539
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,430
Saul's not calling the shots here.

540
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,730
He promised me, goddamn it. Get him on the phone!

541
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:34,040
There's no time. Turn around!

542
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,600
Carrie, turn around now, or we will stop you.

543
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,610
This is your last warning.

544
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,210
Listen to the man, Carrie.

545
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,360
Bravo, I am authorizing force. Take the shot. I repeat.

546
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,750
- Let me. - Take the shot. 

547
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,380
Carrie, this is Quinn.

548
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,700
Break away. I'm sorry. I can't.

549
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,220
You're fucking us, Carrie.
Months of work. Your work.

550
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,840
I don't care. Carrie, I will take the shot.

551
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,060
Window's closing, for Christ's sake!

552
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,250
He's in. Franklin is inside. Pick her up, for God's sake!

553
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,540
Go! Go!

554
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,620
Move it!

555
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,490
Jesus Christ.

556
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,620
What was the delay? I stopped her, didn't I?

557
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,260
Go with her. I'm watching Franklin.

558
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,120
Hospital's on the line. Tell 'em we got a gunshot wound to the upper left bicep,

559
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,150
significant bleeding, might have clipped an artery.

560
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,970
Hold on. You're gonna be all right.

561
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,600
Goddamn it!

562
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,150
Fuck! Fuck!

563
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,920
- Quinn... - Yeah?

564
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,220
Is the bomber dead?

565
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,900
- Yeah. - Fuck!

566
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,250
Fuck!

567
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,290
Something's going on.

568
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,680
- Yeah, you got shot. - Yeah, no shit!

569
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,950
You shot me!

570
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,780
No, I mean, something's going on. None of this... None of this makes sense.

571
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,470
Just breathe, okay? Deep breaths. Come on.

572
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,540
Come here.

573
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,770
Come closer.

574
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:24,550
Where the fuck is Saul?

575
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:39,080
You have a good flight? Yeah, fine.

576
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,170
Got me here.

577
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:49,790
All the money is there.

578
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:55,660
Hey. This way. Wait here.

579
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,150
In another month, it's even hotter.

580
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:23,860
You won't believe.

581
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:27,450
Maybe I use the $10 million to put in an air conditioner.

582
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,840
There.

583
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:45,850
