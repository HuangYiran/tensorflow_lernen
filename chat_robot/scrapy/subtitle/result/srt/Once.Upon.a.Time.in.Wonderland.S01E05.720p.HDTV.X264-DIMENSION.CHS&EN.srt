13
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,820
没人相信爱丽丝
No one believed Alice

14
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,670
所说的仙境冒险
when she spoke of her adventures in Wonderland,

15
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,740
所以红桃杰克和我带她回去
so the Knave of Hearts and I brought her back

16
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,110
寻找她的真爱
to search for her true love.

17
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,940
他在这里  我能感觉到
He's here. I can feel it.

18
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,060
有人想阻止她
There are those who will try to stop her.

19
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,980
让那个女孩许下三个愿
What we want can't be accomplished

20
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,830
我们的目的才能达成
until the girl's made all her wishes.

21
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,610
但是爱丽丝的伟大冒险
But Alice's greatest adventure

22
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,890
刚刚开始
has just begun.

23
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,910
《仙境奇缘》前情提要
Previously in Wonderland...

24
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,360
也许你能骗过所有人
Maybe you've fooled all these people,

25
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,830
但我知道你的真实身份
but I know who you really are.

26
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,670
人们想要你死
People want you dead.

27
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,560
我没法动了
I can't move.

28
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,870
爱丽丝  出什么事了
Alice, what's happening?

29
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,800
安娜斯塔西娅
Anastasia!

30
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,930
你就打算跳进魔镜吗
So you're just going to jump through some magic mirror?

31
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,890
我们可以为所欲为
We can be whoever we want to be.

32
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,200
下一站  
Next stop...

33
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,510
仙境
Wonderland.

34
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,350
你们在干什么
What are you doing?

35
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,500
母亲
Mother.

36
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,080
你跟踪我们到了这里吗
Did you follow us here?

37
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,710
当然是
Damn right I did.

38
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,470
你要和这个废柴
You're going to run off with this...

39
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,380
私奔吗
loser?

40
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,740
是这么回事吗
Is that what's happening here?

41
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,920
这不关你的事
It's none of your business.

42
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,220
我生下了你  亲爱的
I birthed you, dear.

43
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,030
所以如果你打算毁掉你的生活
So if you are going to ruin your life,

44
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,910
这当然和我有关
it absolutely is.

45
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,320
这不是毁掉  妈妈
It's not ruin, mom.

46
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,930
我找到了威尔
I found Will.

47
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,580
我知道
I know.

48
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,190
悲剧就在于此
That's the tragedy.

49
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,580
我想让女儿成为女王
I wanted a queen for a daughter,

50
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,320
但结果她成了什么
but what did I get instead?

51
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,720
一个失败者
A failure.

52
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,520
我终于
I'm happy...

53
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:35,820
得到了快乐
finally.

54
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,910
和他一起吗
With him?

55
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,290
我这一生
I did not spend my entire life

56
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,280
都在拼命工作
working my fingers to the bone

57
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,920
好让你出人头地
so that you could move up,

58
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,210
可不是为了让你抛弃一切的
only to have you toss it all away.

59
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,000
显然你不是当公主的料子
Obviously you're not princess material,

60
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,730
但我以为你至少也能搭上个贵族
but I thought you could at least land a nobleman.

61
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,400
而不是他  小偷威尔・史卡利
Not him-- Will Scarlet, the thief.

62
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,980
我不是小偷  以后不是了
I'm no thief. Not anymore.

63
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,000
他会给你什么样的生活
What kind of a life is he going to give you?

64
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,780
他什么也不必给我
He doesn't need to give me anything.

65
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,600
我爱他
I love him.

66
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,710
你没法靠爱活着  安娜斯塔西娅
You cannot live on love, Anastasia.

67
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,770
当你以自己惨痛的经历得到教训时
And when you learn that lesson the hard way,

68
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,440
你就会回到原点
you will be right back here where you started.

69
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,510
但你回来时  记得带个桶子
But when you come back, bring a bucket.

70
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,950
因为你要进我家门的唯一方法
Because the only way you'll be coming back inside my house

71
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,870
就是给我倒尿壶
is to empty my chamber pot.

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,510
那你们走吧
Off with you then.

73
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,940
至少我还有你妹妹
At least I have your sisters.

74
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,030
别听她的
Don't listen to her.

75
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,900
我会为我们建造新生活的
I'll build us a life--

76
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,590
如果有必要  我会一点点堆砌
brick by brick if I have to.

77
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,720
我爱你
I love you...

78
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,760
是因为真实的你
for who you truly are.

79
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,760
而不是我想让你成为的人
Not for who I want you to be.

80
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,030
来吧
Come on.

81
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,830
再见了  妈妈
Good-bye, mom.

82
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,090
给你披上
There you go...

83
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,050
遮挡雨水和雪花  或者
in case of rain or snow or...

84
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,440
天上掉下的任何东西
anything that might fall from the sky.

85
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,960
真对不起  威尔
I'm so sorry, Will.

86
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,960
如果我没有逼你许下那个愿望
If I hadn't bribed you with that wish,

87
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,270
你就不会...
you would have never...

88
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,120
塞勒斯总说愿望是有代价的
Cyrus always said they had consequences.

89
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,740
现在我明白了
Now I understand.

90
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,030
我会解救你的
I will get you out of this.

91
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,860
如果我能找到塞勒斯  那我们一起就能...
If I can find Cyrus, then together we can...

92
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,390
我在骗谁呢
Who am I fooling?

93
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,080
我都不知道他在哪里
I don't even know where he is.

94
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,940
我知道  好消息吧  亲爱的
Then it's a good thing I do, darling.

95
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,450
也许我们能互相帮助
Perhaps we can help one another.

96
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,480
我为什么要帮你
Why would I do anything to help you?

97
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,440
当时机合适时  人们愿意做什么
You'd be surprised what people are willing to do

98
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,300
会让你大吃一惊的
when the right circumstances present themselves.

99
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,800
你开不出够好的条件让我...
There's not a circumstance you could present that would ever...

100
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,060
连找到
Not even finding out

101
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,230
你亲爱的精灵的关押地也不算吗
where your precious genie is being held?

102
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,770
是啊
Yes.

103
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,980
你不如放低点姿态
So why don't you get down off your high horse,

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,380
我们来做笔交易
and we can make a deal?

105
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,190
什么交易
What sort of a deal?

106
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,170
这笔交易能解决我俩都有的一个问题
The sort of deal to handle the one problem we both share--

107
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,930
贾法尔
Jafar.

108
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,490
你们在合作
You're working together.

109
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,180
他怎么是你的问题了
How is he a problem for you?

110
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,480
他只不过是我达到目的的手段  亲爱的
Well, he's simply a means to an end, darling.

111
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,160
但当目的达成时  我得保证
But when that end comes, I need to ensure

112
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,330
我有能力保护自己
I have the power to protect myself.

113
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,440
我可不想和你朋友下场一样
Wouldn't want to end up like your friend here,

114
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,590
对吧
now would we?

115
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,200
他也是你的朋友  曾经是
He was your friend, too, once.

116
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,350
据我所知  不止是个朋友
More than a friend, from what I gather.

117
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,140
或者他也只是你达到目的的手段
Or was he just a means to an end as well?

118
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,490
那就是你的问题  爱丽丝
That's your problem, Alice--

119
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,700
当你该考虑未来时
always dwelling on the past,

120
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,590
却总是沉湎于过去
when really you should be thinking about the future.

121
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,050
你到底想让我做什么
What exactly is it you want me to do?

122
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,680
帮我弄点东西
Help me procure something.

123
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,010
就是一点粉末状的魔法
Just a little bit of magic in the form of dust.

124
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,010
大概一日路程
It's about a day's journey away.

125
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,670
这能保护我免受黑魔法的伤害
And it's going to protect me against dark magic

126
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,350
比如贾法尔那种
such as Jafar's.

127
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,110
你这么想要的话  自己去取
If you want it so badly, get it yourself.

128
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,580
我也想  亲爱的
I would, darling,

129
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,550
但这么强大的东西到现在还原封未动
but there's a reason something so powerful

130
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,890
是有原因的
sits untouched.

131
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,990
要得到它  对多数人来说简直是寻死
Retrieving it, for most, is a suicide mission.

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,150
而你认为我会就这么答应以身犯险
And you think I'll just agree to risk my life?

133
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,730
不  至少得给你点好处
No. No, not unless you're properly compensated.

134
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,660
所以我提出这项交易
Which is why I propose a trade.

135
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,240
你把魔尘给我弄来
You get me the dust,

136
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,880
我就帮你找你的精灵
and I'll help you find your genie.

137
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,370
我自己会找  谢了
I'll find him myself, thank you.

138
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,600
可你不知道上哪找
Not if you don't know where you're looking.

139
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,130
贾法尔的塔以魔法隐匿
Jafar's tower is hidden, enshrouded by magic.

140
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,150
没有我的话  你即使站在塔前
You could be standing right in front of it,

141
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,270
也毫不知情
not knowing it's there, without my help.

142
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,320
你想找到塞勒斯  我是你最好的机会
If you want to find Cyrus, then I am your best bet--

143
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,440
也是唯一的机会
Your only bet, actually.

144
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,160
他们对你做了什么
What did they do to you?

145
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,420
今天
Today...

146
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,300
是巨石
it was the giant rocks.

147
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,000
有些甚至跟人一样大
Some of them as large as a man.

148
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,760
他逼我把石头
He makes me move them

149
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,870
从石梯底部搬到顶部
from the bottom of the stone staircase to the top.

150
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,660
为什么
For what purpose?

151
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,530
没理由
None.

152
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,480
那他为什么把你关在这里
Well, then why does he keep you here?

153
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,380
跟你一样
Like you...

154
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,120
我身上有他想要的东西
I have something he wants.

155
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,970
是什么
Which is what?

156
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,310
无所谓
Doesn't matter.

157
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,320
因为他永远都得不到
Because it's something he will never get.

158
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,500
所以我将继续被他惩罚
And so my punishment continues.

159
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,200
不会很久了  老先生
Well, not for long, old man.

160
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,610
因为今天就是我们离开这里的日子
Because today's the day we get out of here.

161
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,050
你确定是这里吗
Are you sure this is the spot?

162
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,230
我一颗浆果都没看到  我快饿死了
I've not seen a single berry, and I'm bloody starving.

163
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,660
上周这里还有很多呢
Yeah, there was a bunch here last week.

164
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,060
我们那天捕到的鱼呢
What about that fish we caught the other day?

165
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,010
-还有剩的吗  -没了
- We got any of that left? - No...

166
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,270
只剩骨头了
Just the bones.

167
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,630
可以把鱼骨在水里浸久一点
We could soak 'em in water long enough...

168
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,110
那就是汤了
and call it soup.

169
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,220
天哪  快看啊
Bloody hell, will you look at that?

170
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,120
这个可以炖出靓汤
This'll make a right fine stew.

171
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,800
别碰
Ah! No! Don't!

172
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,130
这蘑菇会把你变大
Those are the mushrooms that make you grow big.

173
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,540
现在这马车都快坐不下了
We can barely fit in the wagon as it is.

174
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,800
马车太小了吗
The wagon too small for ya?

175
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,910
当然不是
No, of course not.

176
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,720
我们只要这样的就行
It's all we need.

177
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,700
抱歉  亲爱的  我已经尽力了
I'm sorry, luv. I am doing the best I can.

178
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:02,940
我知道
I know.

179
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,440
我只是以为这里一切会有所不同
I just thought things would be different here.

180
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,070
我第一次听闻仙境时
When I first heard about Wonderland,

181
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,190
以为这里会奇妙美好
I figured that the "wonder" was short for "wonderful",

182
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,890
而不是日日担心怎么过活
not "wonder how we're gonna make it?"

183
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,560
我爱你
Well, I love ya.

184
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,810
我保证  我们会撑过去的
And I promise ya, we will make it.

185
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,380
那些面包闻起来太香了
Ahh! Smell that bread, it smells heavenly.

186
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,800
能给我们一块吗  伙计
Can you spare a loaf, mate?

187
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,910
不行  这是贡品
Can't. It's for the palace.

188
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,540
宫里要办舞会  连面包屑都得端上
There's to be a ball, and every crumb's spoken for.

189
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,380
真是谢谢了
Well, thanks a lot then.

190
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,970
也许我们该走了
Maybe we should go.

191
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,470
但我们还没找到浆果
But we haven't found any berries yet.

192
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,050
不  去舞会
No, to the ball.

193
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,400
我们也该去
We should go.

194
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,050
听说宫殿内部美轮美奂
I hear the palace is dazzling inside.

195
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,680
但有个小问题  我们没有受邀
There's the slight matter of not being invited.

196
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,540
这种问题什么时候能阻挡我们了
Since when has that ever stopped us?

197
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,730
咱俩可以换换环境
We could both do with a little change of scenery.

198
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,130
更重要的是  能吃到面包
And more importantly, some of that bread.

199
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,120
穿这裙子可不行
You know, that dress will never do.

200
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,850
得帮你"借"条新的
We'll have to borrow you a new one.

201
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,440
魔尘在哪
Where's this dust?

202
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,380
大峡谷的另一头
The other side of the Great Divide.

203
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,550
我听说过那地方
I've heard of that place.

204
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,150
那里充满了黑暗
There's a darkness there.

205
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,370
太阳落山之后  哪里都有黑暗
There's a darkness everywhere when the sun goes down.

206
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,780
先说清楚
Just so we're clear,

207
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,520
我会给你弄到魔尘
I'll get you your magic dust.

208
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,560
但一切结束后
But when this is all over...

209
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,780
你最担心的可不会是贾法尔了
Jafar will be the least of your problems.

210
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,010
让我猜猜
Let me guess,

211
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,020
你要让我为对塞勒斯做的事付出代价
you're going to make me suffer for what I did to your Cyrus?

212
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,850
我不是你以为的魔鬼
I'm not the monster you take me for.

213
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,570
我没杀塞勒斯
I didn't kill Cyrus.

214
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,050
再变成囚犯对他来说与死无异
Being a prisoner again is the same as death to him.

215
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,270
但对你不是
But not to you...

216
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,940
所以你才回到仙境
which is what got you back to Wonderland.

217
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,390
你到底想要什么
What exactly do you hope to gain from all of this?

218
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,510
你有权利  财富
You have power, wealth...

219
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,710
还想要什么
what more could you possibly need?

220
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,090
有些东西权利和财富都换不来
There are some things that all the wealth and power cannot get you.

221
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,260
比如呢
Like what?

222
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,580
我们来仙境
We all come to Wonderland

223
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,580
都有所求  亲爱的
looking for something more, darling.

224
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,880
我依稀记得一个身着蓝裙的小女孩
I seem to remember a little girl in a blue dress

225
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,540
渴望着父亲的爱
wanting her father's love.

226
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,150
我和你完全不同
You and I are nothing alike.

227
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,770
我们都渴求自己没有的东西  爱丽丝
We both want something we don't have, Alice.

228
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,610
不同的仅是我们愿意为此做些什么
It's just a matter of what we're willing to do to get it.

229
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,890
再说一遍你看到什么了
Tell me again what you saw.

230
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,960
走廊直通北面
This hallway goes north

231
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,700
有一条只能往下走的楼梯
to a staircase that only leads down.

232
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,220
那守卫呢
And the guards?

233
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,540
只有几个
Only a few...

234
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,570
这令我很担心
which worries me.

235
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,430
怎么说
How's that?

236
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,070
贾法尔警觉性很高
Jafar is vigilant--

237
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,550
总是领先于他的敌人
Always ahead of his enemies.

238
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,110
如果他在里面只有几个守卫的话
If he only has a handful of guards inside...

239
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,250
也许大部分都守在外面
then perhaps the majority of them are on the outside.

240
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,720
那我们等到黄昏
Well, then we wait for nightfall,

241
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,650
趁夜色离开
and make our way out under the cover of dark.

242
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,060
我看到有人试过
I've seen others try.

243
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,540
没人成功
None succeeded.

244
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,120
但我想没人像你这么有决心
But I think none were as determined as you.

245
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,880
秘诀是不要看这些栅栏
Well, the trick is to not see the bars,

246
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,820
而是要看笼子外面的世界
but rather what lies beyond them.

247
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,240
外面肯定有你心爱的人
Surely there's someone out there you love.

248
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,100
家人
A family?

249
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,710
我
I...

250
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,710
曾经拥有自己的生活
had a life once.

251
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,030
可现在那已不再属于我了
It is lost to me now.

252
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,650
那么全新的生活正在等着你
Well, then a new one awaits you.

253
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,810
在瓶子里待了一辈子后  我知道
After a lifetime in a bottle, I know this--

254
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,460
没人应该被人俘虏
No one deserves to be another man's prisoner.

255
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,370
如果我能获得自由
And if I am to be free,

256
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,910
那你也能
then so are you.

257
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,510
这是您要求的物品
The item you requested.

258
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,480
贾法尔
Jafar...

259
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,360
你想要什么
uh... what do you want?

260
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,720
兔子  你引起了我的注意
I'm intrigued by you, Rabbit.

261
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,660
不是要把我当主食吃掉的那种吧
Not in a-a main course kind of way, I hope?

262
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,160
大可安心  你还没有拿来煮的价值
Rest easy, you're far too valuable to cook.

263
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,790
真是松了一口气
Oh, what a relief.

264
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,310
我感兴趣的是为何一个认识爱丽丝那么久的人
I'm interested why someone who's known Alice for so long

265
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,530
还会如此深深地背叛她
would betray her so deeply.

266
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,800
我认识她的时间并不长
I, uh, haven't known her that long.

267
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,100
最多是个熟人而已
I'm more of an acquaintance, really.

268
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,360
你有困难
You have a problem,

269
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,330
而我善于解决困难
and I'm good at solutions.

270
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,700
我能帮你解决你欠女王的债务
I'm offering to help you with your debt to the queen.

271
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,970
但我所要的交换条件是要你帮我
All that I require in exchange is that you help me.

272
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,940
以什么来帮你
With what?

273
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,170
爱丽丝
Alice.

274
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,610
从她还是小女孩起  你就认识她了
You've known her since she was a girl.

275
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,030
我需要知道她的一切
I need to know everything about her--

276
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,470
特别是她曾经深爱过的人
particularly everyone she's ever loved.

277
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,210
那么
Now...

278
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,240
成交吗
do we have a deal?

279
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,480
我的朋友
My friend...

280
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,550
不要往下看
don't look down.

281
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,680
猩猩  我这边需要点东西
Orang! I need something up here.

282
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,560
不
No!

283
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,550
在找我吗
You looking for me?

284
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,420
我还没见过这个地方
I haven't seen this place.

285
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,750
很少有人见过之后  还能活着讲这个故事
Few have and lived to tell the tale.

286
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,920
真会安慰人
Comforting.

287
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,570
那么
Well, then...

288
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,780
魔尘到底在哪里
where exactly is this magic dust?

289
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,210
就在那边
Over there.

290
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,440
越过这峡谷吗
Across the ravine?

291
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,980
-我想这里没有桥或  -恐怕没有
- I don't suppose there's a bridge or-- - Afraid not.

292
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,820
那你的魔法呢
And your magic?

293
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,600
亲爱的  如果我能自己拿到的话
Darling, if I could have gotten it myself,

294
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,120
你不认为我现在就能到手了吗
don't you think I would have by now?

295
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,010
也许不可能拿得到
Maybe it's impossible.

296
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,700
当然不是每个人都能
Not for everyone.

297
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,120
心地纯洁的人将跨越天堑

298
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,740
心地纯洁的人将跨越天堑
"The pure of heart shall make the leap."

299
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,450
显然是某种测试
It appears to be some sort of test.

300
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,910
-你怎么知道我能通过  -我不知道
- How do you know I'll pass? - I don't.

301
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,290
但是在我们俩当中
But between the two of us,

302
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,990
我觉得你成功的可能性比我大
I like your chances better than mine.

303
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,040
亲爱的  我有很多东西
I am many things, darling,

304
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,260
但是没有纯洁的心灵
But pure of heart is not one of them.

305
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,680
看看这里
Look here.

306
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,000
甚至比我想象中的还要漂亮
It's even more beautiful than I imagined.

307
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,250
我觉得我穿反裤子了
Me trousers feel like they're on backwards.

308
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,910
不要在扭来扭去了  大家都在看呢
Stop squirming, will you? People are looking.

309
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,860
那是因为我们不属于这里  安娜
That's 'cause we don't belong here, Anna.

310
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,590
这一刻  想象一下我们属于这里
Just for a moment, imagine we do.

311
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,320
如果我们相信  他们也会相信
If we believe it... so will they.

312
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,220
瞧瞧那些吃的
Look at all that food.

313
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,360
就这样浪费实在太遗憾了
It would be a shame to let it go to waste.

314
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,200
你来吗
Are you coming?

315
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,120
等一会吧
In a moment.

316
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,790
-我要到处看看  -好
- I'm just gonna look around. - All right.

317
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,520
我马上就回来
I'll be back.

318
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,810
-你看上去太漂亮了  -谢谢
- And don't you look lovely? - Why, thank you.

319
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,900
亲爱的  我只是羡慕那顶王冠
I was just admiring the crown jewels, darling.

320
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,230
非常想拥有它们
They're simply to die for.

321
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,520
亲爱的  我只是羡慕那顶王冠
"I was just admiring your crown jewels, darling."

322
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,960
亲爱的  我只是羡慕那顶王冠
"I was just admiring your crown jewels, darling."

323
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,020
亲爱的  你好
Hello, darling.

324
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,250
大部分人会说陛下
Most people go with "Your majesty."

325
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,080
非常抱歉  我不是有意要
So sorry. I didn't mean to--

326
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,400
我知道  没必要道歉
I know. No need to apologize.

327
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,490
女士  请
Milady?

328
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,870
请不要介意
Don't mind if I do.

329
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,970
我很久没参加过正式的舞会了
It's been so long since I've been to a proper ball.

330
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,560
有很多不正式的舞会吗
Are there many improper ones?

331
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,470
真的
Indeed.

332
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,640
我必须承认  我觉得他们
I must confess, I find them...

333
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:42,990
很无聊
boring.

334
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,820
我非常想换个环境
I'm desperate for a change of scenery.

335
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,380
是的
Yes.

336
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,120
我知道这种感觉
Yes, I know the feeling.

337
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,470
我知道每个在我王宫里的贵妇人
I know every lady in my court.

338
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,950
可为什么我以前从未见过你
Why haven't I seen you before?

339
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,570
我想
I'd say...

340
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,920
不是你还没看仔细
either you haven't been looking hard enough...

341
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,100
就是也许我不是位贵妇人
or maybe I'm no lady.

342
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,670
小偷  小偷  抓住他
Thief! Thief! Grab him!

343
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,440
快走
Come on. Move it!

344
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,130
大人  他的请柬是伪造的
Sire... His invitation is clearly a forgery.

345
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,800
那是我的裙子
That's my dress!

346
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,760
她从我的马车上偷来的
She stole it from my carriage.

347
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,790
一个小偷
A common thief!

348
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,660
骗子
Imposter!

349
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,250
乡下人
Peasant!

350
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,240
我们成功了
We did it.

351
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:52,750
成功了
Did it?

352
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,460
我们被抓到了
We got pinched.

353
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,180
不  我们偷到东西了
Nah, we did the pinching.

354
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,800
这够我们吃一个礼拜了
This'll last us a week at least.

355
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,620
也不用再穿这些紧巴巴的衣服
And we won't have to bother with them stuffed shirts.

356
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,490
就是字面的意思
Literally.

357
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,350
好吗
Right?

358
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,180
好吧
Right.

359
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,520
走吧  咱们回家  面包还热着呢
Come on, let's go home. Bread's still warm.

360
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,110
我怎么知道你不是在骗我
How do I know this isn't a trick?

361
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,580
如果你就想让我掉下去
That you intend for me to fall?

362
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,300
那我就不得不用掉一个愿望来救命
Then I'll have to use one of my wishes to save my life.

363
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,780
如果我想让你掉下悬崖
If I wanted you to fall off the cliff,

364
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,190
我会直接把你推下去
I'd push you.

365
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,650
心地纯洁的人将跨越天堑
"The pure of heart shall make the leap."

366
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,460
没人能跨过这儿
No one could leap over that,

367
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,250
不管他们的心有多纯洁
No matter how pure their heart was.

368
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,420
除非那才是重点
Unless that's the point.

369
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,620
你是什么意思
What do you mean?

370
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,050
这事没办法做到
There's no way you can do it.

371
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,270
它是条谜语
It's a riddle.

372
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,790
也许它是在比喻什么
Maybe it's a figurative leap--

373
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,110
比如说选择相信
Like a leap of faith.

374
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,760
相信什么
Faith in what?

375
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,130
我不知道
I don't know.

376
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,730
我对你抱有如此大的期望
I had such high hopes for you.

377
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,910
爱丽丝  你再也别想见到精灵了
Alice, you can say good-bye to seeing your genie again.

378
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,370
等等
Wait.

379
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,150
心地纯洁的人将跨越天堑
"The pure of heart shall make the leap."

380
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:16,860
也许我只需要相信
Maybe I just need to have faith

381
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,520
我心底最纯洁的东西
in the purest thing in my heart--

382
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,490
我对塞勒斯的爱
My love for Cyrus.

383
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,230
我对他的信心将带我跨越天堑
My faith in him will carry me across.

384
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,640
你确定吗
You're quite sure?

385
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,840
当两个人相爱
When two people love each other...

386
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,150
没有什么是他们做不到的
there's nothing they can't accomplish together.

387
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,670
只要那是真爱
If only that were true.

388
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,910
我们的心紧紧相连
Our hearts are entwined.

389
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,800
王后
Queen?!

390
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,250
喂
Hello?!

391
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,560
王后
Queen?!

392
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,280
有人听到吗
Can anybody hear me?!

393
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,740
她失败了
She failed.

394
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,870
回宫吧  女王陛下
Back to the palace, your Majesty.

395
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,420
我才是有权下令回宫的那个
I shall be the one that tells you when we are leaving.

396
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,970
我们失败了
We failed.

397
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,540
是时候回家了
It's time to go home.

398
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,760
抱歉  你刚刚说你想回...
I'm sorry, did you say you wanted to go--

399
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,550
回家
Home...

400
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,620
去找我母亲
To my mother.

401
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,810
不
No.

402
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,300
不行
No way.

403
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,830
我知道事情和我们想的不太一样
Look, I know things aren't exactly how we imagined.

404
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,880
是完全不同
There nothing like we imagined.

405
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,530
你不能回你母亲那儿
You're not going back to your mother's.

406
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,730
她不会收留你的
She'll never let you live it down.

407
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,880
我又没说我们要两手空空地回去
Didn't say we had to go back empty-handed, eh?

408
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,780
你是什么意思
What do you mean?

409
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,690
我们去偷一些珠宝
We are gonna steal the crown jewels.

410
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,840
你说什么
Sorry?

411
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,510
我看到了  在皇宫里
I saw them. They were at the palace.

412
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,010
在主厅的箱子里
In a case off the main hall.

413
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,630
威尔  拜托
Oh, Will, come on.

414
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,930
不是你说为了好的目的去偷窃
Weren't you the one that said it was okay to steal

415
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,350
无伤大雅
if it was for a good reason?

416
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,460
你和绿林好汉们在一起的时候
When you were with the Merry Men,

417
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,140
不正是这么做的吗
isn't that what you did?

418
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,320
劫富济贫
Stole from the rich and gave to the poor?

419
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,840
我们就是穷人  威尔
Well, we are poor, Will.

420
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,980
唯一的不同是没人会施舍我们
Only difference is no one's givin' us anything.

421
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,080
我知道
I know.

422
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,220
你在宫殿东面的阳台下面等我
You'll wait beneath the balcony on the east side of the palace.

423
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,130
我会溜进去
I'll sneak up...

424
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,050
取走珠宝  从阳台上扔给你
take the jewels and drop 'em down to ya.

425
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,170
我们说过不再做那些事了
We said we were done with all that--

426
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,190
偷窃  逃亡
Thieving, life on the run.

427
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,000
因此这才完美
That's why it's perfect.

428
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,320
最后一次
One last time.

429
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,810
然后我们穿过魔镜消失得无影无踪
Then we disappear through the looking glass...

430
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,570
回家后把珠宝卖掉
and sell the riches when we're back home,

431
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,650
也不必担心被抓
without any fear of being caught.

432
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,510
你考虑得很周密
You've given this a lot of thought.

433
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,270
是啊
Yes.

434
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,870
这是过上我们想象的生活的最好机会
Because it's our best chance of living the life we imagined.

435
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,410
我以为我才是
I thought I was your best chance for that.

436
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,230
会成功的
It's gonna work.

437
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,000
我们必须这么做
It has to work.

438
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,670
我们只有一次机会
We only get one shot at this.

439
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,630
准备好了吗
You ready?

440
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,030
你在干什么
What are you doing?

441
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,030
确保我不会拖你后腿
Making certain I don't slow you down.

442
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,960
你有必须要做的事
You know what you must do.

443
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,410
祝你好运  塞勒斯
Good luck, Cyrus.

444
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,380
我不能丢下你
I won't leave you!

445
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,970
没时间争论了
There's no time to argue.

446
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,450
如果贾法尔知道你看着我逃跑
When Jafar learns you witnessed my escape

447
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,020
却没有通知守卫  他会杀了你的
without alerting the guards, he will kill you.

448
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,100
不  他不会
No. He won't.

449
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,010
你怎么知道
How do you know?

450
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,480
相信我
Trust me.

451
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,690
我知道的
I know.

452
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,550
你和我一样清楚守卫的时间表
You're as familiar with the guards' schedule as I am.

453
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,300
如果你现在不离开  你就没机会了
If you don't leave now, you have no chance.

454
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,030
那么  再见了
Farewell, then.

455
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,240
祝你好运
And good luck.

456
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,460
你也是  我的朋友
To you as well, my friend.

457
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,910
她喜欢茶会吗
She enjoys tea parties?

458
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,990
这就是你能给我的秘密吗
That's the insight you give me?

459
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,830
是真的
Well, it's true.

460
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,940
这我已经知道了
I already know that.

461
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,720
实际上  到目前为止你说的一切我都知道
In fact, I know everything you've told me thus far.

462
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,110
别再拖延了
Stop stalling.

463
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,110
她有弱点
She has a weakness.

464
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,620
那就是她在意别人
And that weakness is she cares about people.

465
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,030
我要你告诉我  在仙境中她还在乎谁
I need you to tell me who else in wonderland matters to her--

466
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,680
会为了他们的性命而许愿
Enough so she might wish for their survival.

467
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,550
我很想帮你  但是我真的不知道
Well, I'd like to help you, but I really don't know any--

468
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,390
我很好奇是谁想出"幸运兔脚"这个词的
I wonder who coined the term "Lucky rabbit's foot."

469
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,070
显然不是兔子了  对吧
Certainly wasn't the rabbit, was it?

470
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,370
现在
Now...

471
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,870
也许下一刻
It so happens that for about the next minute,

472
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,200
我可以改变你的困境
I can reverse your predicament.

473
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,330
求求你
Oh, please.

474
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,570
我可以让你再次完整
I can make you whole again.

475
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,830
求你了  做什么都行
Please, anything.

476
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:32,700
在仙境还有谁是她在乎的
Who else in wonderland does she care about?

477
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,230
滴答
Tick...

478
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,070
滴答
Tock.

479
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,390
是有人的
There--there is someone,

480
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,430
但是他们不在仙境
but they're not in wonderland.

481
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,560
有人吗
Hello?!

482
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,580
有人能听见我说话吗
Can anybody hear me?

483
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,080
爱丽丝
Alice!

484
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,790
有人吗
Is somebody there?

485
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,500
爱丽丝
Alice...

486
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,880
谁在哪
Who's there?

487
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,350
爱丽丝
Alice...

488
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,390
快现身
Show yourself!

489
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,860
你好  爱丽丝
Hello, Alice.

490
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,040
很高兴再见到你
It's lovely to see you again.

491
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,360
你是什么妖怪
What... what are you?

492
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,670
我是来帮你的
I'm here to help you.

493
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,010
你知道我在哪儿可以找到魔尘吗
Do you know where I can find the magic dust?

494
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,210
也许吧
Maybe.

495
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,830
我知道很多事情
I know a lot of things.

496
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,930
你能指给我吗
Will you show me?

497
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:50,950
现在还不行
Not yet.

498
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,370
为什么不行
Why not?

499
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,110
因为你还不够资格
Because you haven't earned it.

500
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,230
告诉我我需要做些什么
Tell me what I need to do.

501
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,650
你知道你必须要做什么  爱丽丝
You know what you have to do, Alice.

502
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,170
我真的不知道
Really, I don't.

503
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,340
在你被锁起来的时候
When you were locked away,

504
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,620
你的梦
your dreams.

505
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,020
记得你的梦吗
Remember your dreams?

506
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,050
是的
Yes.

507
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,170
我梦到了塞勒斯
I dreamt of Cyrus.

508
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,110
为什么呢
Why?

509
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,110
因为我爱着他  我以为他死了
Because I loved him. I thought he was dead.

510
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,080
因为你想要复仇
Because you wanted revenge.

511
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,360
不是
No!

512
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,460
你在梦中要惩罚那些夺走他的人
You dreamt of what you'd do to those who took him.

513
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,900
那不是真的
That's not true.

514
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,700
爱丽丝  我就是你  你骗不了我
Alice, I'm you! You can't lie to me!

515
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,470
你骗不了自己
You can't lie to yourself!

516
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,080
你在干什么
What are you doing?

517
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,570
我在帮你达成愿望
I'm helping you get what you want.

518
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,480
-是什么  -杀死红心王后的机会
- Which is what? - The chance to kill the Red Queen.

519
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,010
去啊
Go ahead.

520
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,270
但是她会告诉我塞勒斯在哪
But she's gonna tell me where Cyrus is.

521
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,490
你信她吗
And you believe her?

522
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,640
那么  这里出了什么事
Now then, what is going on here?

523
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,540
动手啊  爱丽丝
Do it, Alice.

524
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,530
我才是你可以信任的人
I'm the one you can trust!

525
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,140
不  你只是一个幻觉  你只是存在在我的脑中
No, you're just a vision. You're just in my head.

526
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,930
我也在她脑中
I'm in her head, too.

527
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,410
我知道你知道什么  我知道她知道什么
I know what you know. I know what she knows.

528
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,840
杀了她  然后我会告诉你塞勒斯在哪
Kill her! And I'll tell you where Cyrus is.

529
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,590
在这下面  魔法是不起作用的
Magic doesn't work down here.

530
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,770
她毫无防御之力
She's defenseless,

531
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,440
就像她带走塞勒斯时的你
just like you were when she took Cyrus away.

532
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,510
她这一生做尽坏事
She's been bad her whole life,

533
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,130
而我们一直都是好人
and we've been good.

534
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,190
我们得到了什么呢
And where's that gotten us?

535
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,230
她是王后  而我们饱受折磨
She's a queen, and we're suffering.

536
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,220
爱丽丝
Alice...

537
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,370
拜托
Please.

538
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,290
动手
Do it!

539
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,470
抱歉
I'm sorry.

540
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,540
但是得有人让你为自己的行为付出代价
But someone needs to make you pay for what you've done.

541
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,360
只是  那不该是我
That's just not going to be me.

542
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,820
爱丽丝
Alice...

543
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,790
恭喜你
Congratulations.

544
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,810
你成功了
You did it.

545
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,940
但她还活着
But she lives.

546
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,910
没错  那就是测试
Indeed, that was the test.

547
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,560
你真的拥有纯洁的心灵
You truly are pure of heart.

548
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,830
你能
Would you?

549
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,740
魔尘
The magic dust!

550
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,990
成功了
We did it.

551
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,040
是的
Yes.

552
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,500
我不明白
I don't understand.

553
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,530
你为什么不杀了我
Why didn't you kill me?

554
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,410
你会得到你想要的一切
You'd have had everything you wanted.

555
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,580
因为我不像你
Because I'm not like you.

556
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,150
不
No...

557
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,130
我想你的确不像
I suppose you're not.

558
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,130
很漂亮  是吗
Pretty, isn't it?

559
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
那么来吧  把它给我
Come on, then. Hand it over.

560
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,760
首先  告诉我到哪里去找塞勒斯
First, tell me where I can find Cyrus.

561
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,480
爱丽丝
Oh, Alice.

562
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,580
做一个好人这样的报酬还不够吗
Isn't being such a good person reward enough?

563
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,940
你撒谎了
You lied.

564
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,080
没错
Indeed.

565
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,250
别忘了
Lest we forget...

566
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,060
我们之中有一个心地纯洁
One of us is pure of heart.

567
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,330
是我留给了你一条命
I gave you your life.

568
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,410
不  没有人给我任何东西
No! Nobody ever gave me anything.

569
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:05,420
我的所有之物  都是我自己争取来的
Everything I have, I had to take.

570
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,900
那么你的所失之物呢
What about everything you've lost?

571
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,890
照顾好自己  爱丽丝
Take care, Alice.

572
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,940
我们很快会再见面的
I'm sure I'll see you again soon.

573
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,110
你不能永远寄望于这些愿望
Can't hold onto those wishes forever...

574
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,260
也不能寄望与塞勒斯重逢
or the hope of seeing Cyrus again.

575
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,420
我会和他重逢的
I will see him again.

576
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,110
你听见了吗
Did you hear that?

577
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,360
如果有人逃走  贾法尔会要了我们的命
Jafar will have our heads if anyone gets away.

578
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,780
我们去看看
Let's go have a look.

579
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,980
谢谢你  兔子
Thank you, rabbit.

580
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,680
这的确对我很有用
I actually think that was helpful.

581
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,470
那我可以走了吗 
Uh, can I leave now?

582
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,360
还不行
Not quite.

583
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,680
但我已经把所有事都告诉你了
But I've told you everything.

584
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,070
我也许不需要你再说什么了
There might not be more to say,

585
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,610
但还有很多事需要你去做
But there's certainly more to do.

586
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,980
现在我想出去走走
I'd like to take a trip now.

587
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,590
你可以坐着魔毯去
Well, you've got your carpet.

588
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,410
我想去的地方  只有你能带我去
Where I want to go is a place only you can take me.

589
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,620
开始挖洞
Start digging.

590
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,520
贾法尔  我不能就这么走了
Jafar, I can't just leave.

591
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,390
皇后会察觉到的  然后...
The queen will know something is wrong, a-and then--

592
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,390
现在你为我做事  兔子
You work for me now, rabbit.

593
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:32,290
还是你需要我再提醒一下你
Or do I really need to remind you?

594
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,690
兔子
Rabbit!

595
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,050
兔子
Rabbit!

596
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,170
兔子
Rabbit!

597
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,970
求你  别叫
Please don't.

598
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,250
兔子
Rabbit!

599
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:51,450
快走
Just go.

600
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:52,590
什么
What?

601
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,540
去找她  快走
Find her. Go!

602
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,410
兔子
Rabbit!

603
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,210
我知道反抗你是没用的  贾法尔
I know it's futile to resist you, Jafar.

604
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,100
我会遵照你的指示
I'll do what you ask.

605
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,920
你做对了
You made the right choice.

606
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,020
即使找到出路逃出这座塔
Even if you did find your way out of the tower,

607
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,620
你也没办法逃出塔外之物的魔爪
There's no escaping what's beyond it.

608
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,250
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

609
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,110
你应该庆幸你没有去亲身体验
Just be glad you didn't find out.

610
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,010
开始挖洞吧
Now dig your hole.

611
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,000
去哪
Where to?

612
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,570
你知道去哪
You know where.

613
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,340
溜进我的舞会是一回事
Sneaking into my ball was one thing.

614
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,780
我倒是很欣赏你的大胆
I rather admire the boldness of it.

615
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,330
但偷我东西就另当别论了
But stealing from me?

616
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,250
为什么要这样
What possessed you?

617
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,680
这有关系吗
Does it matter?

618
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,430
有关系
It might.

619
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,140
在这片国土上  您比任何人都要富有
You have more wealth than anyone in the realm.

620
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,070
丢了也不会在意
You'll hardly miss it.

621
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,200
我比您更需要它们
I need it more than you do.

622
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,400
一个农妇要珠宝来做什么
What does a peasant need with jewels?

623
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,560
一个国王要珠宝来做什么
What does a king need with them?

624
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,220
亲爱的  现实就是如此
That, my dear, is the way it goes.

625
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,610
我的世界充满了财富
My world... filled with wealth,

626
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,610
而你的世界...
And yours...

627
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,300
充满了对财富的渴求
filled with longing.

628
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,300
通常  我们的世界是没有交集的
Generally, our realms don't meet.

629
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,740
您抓住了我
You caught me.

630
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,160
我的命运将会如何
What will my fate be?

631
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,710
这取决于你
That depends on you.

632
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,400
小姑娘  你现在的世界
Ah, there's something about you, girl.

633
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,180
你现在的生活
The life you're in,

634
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,670
并不是你应该过的生活  对吗
It isn't the one you were meant for, is it?

635
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,950
我就只需要这些
It's all I need.

636
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,890
那你为何还要偷盗
Then why are you stealing?

637
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,200
如果你不需要偷盗珠宝
What if instead of stealing these jewels,

638
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,450
而单纯的拥有它们呢
they simply... belonged to you?

639
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,830
您会把它们送给我吗
You'll give them to me?

640
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,650
也许会
Perhaps.

641
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,380
有何代价
At what price?

642
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,120
执子之手
Your hand,

643
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,340
与子偕老
in marriage.

644
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,600
我一直在找一个皇后
I have been searching for a queen.

645
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,920
而你完全符合要求
And you fit the bill.

646
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,650
你所有的...
What you have...

647
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,650
远远不止是美貌
Goes far beyond your beauty.

648
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:54,260
你的品质极其令人难以琢磨
What you have is what is most elusive--

649
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:57,830
你的追求远超能力范围的事物
The drive to be more than you are.

650
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,260
这正是统治之道
That is how one rules.

651
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,740
这也是...
And that...

652
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,080
我渴望拥有的力量
is what I desire at my side.

653
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,550
如果我爱的是其他人呢
What if I love another?

654
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:16,070
我知道  舞会上的那个小伙
Yes, the fellow from the ball.

655
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,320
爱情是神圣的
Love is a noble thing.

656
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,510
但它能支持你们多久
But how far will it get you, hmm?

657
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,020
假设你卖掉它
Let's say you sell this.

658
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,960
得到的钱又能让你们
How long would it last you before you're

659
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,480
挥霍多久
right back where you started?

660
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,130
而不久之后你就会意识到
And that love you cling to,

661
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,080
你所不离不弃的爱情是不够的
It won't be long before you realize, it's not enough.

662
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,370
接下来
And then?

663
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,820
接下来  亲爱的  就太晚了
And then, my dear, it will be too late for you.

664
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,180
快点  快点
Come on, come on.

665
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,070
仙境的人民们
People of wonderland,

666
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,440
容我向你们介绍
I give you...

667
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:04,640
你们的皇后
Your queen.

668
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,300
安娜斯塔西娅
Anastasia.

669
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,690
对不起
I'm sorry.

670
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,720
很好  塞勒斯
All right, cyrus.

671
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,540
我知道你就在这附近
I know you're out there somewhere.

672
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,170
指路吧
Now show me.

673
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,800
我来找你了
I'm coming for you.

674
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,720
爱丽丝  我来找你了
Alice, I'm coming for you.
