So much for the wagon, huh?

67
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,240
那是

"安慰受折磨的人  折磨安逸的人"

法利·彼得·德昂[美國幽默作家  新聞工作者]

74
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,460
這話出自他口  我在二十歲時
He said that. I wrote this when I was...

75
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,140
-寫下了這段話  -那就成為好記者
- 20. - So be a good journalist;

77
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,240
你知道我車里怎么會被人裝炸彈嗎
You know why I ended up in my car with that bomb?

78
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,930
不知道
No.

79

80
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,400
解釋一下

81
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,770
六年前
Six years ago...

82

我
and I was, uh...

83
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,440
我跟小桑迪·索爾一起鬼混
I was hanging out with Santi Sol Jr.

84
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,220
我們可卡因不夠了
And we needed more coke,

85
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,230
他就過邊橋去取
so he went back across the bridge to get some.

86
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,880
他撞到了那個女人的車
He clipped that woman's car.

87
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,500
卻連車都沒停
He just kept going.

88
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,910
是他撞了人  不是你
He did, not you.

89
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,250
正要說到我變成人渣的部分
Yeah, but this-this is the part where I become a shitty human being.

90
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,420
我沒有去作證
See, instead of, say, I don't know, testifying,

91
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,260
沒有撫平傷痛
instead of comforting the afflicted,

92
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,050
我接受了小桑迪他爸的收買
I just let Santi Jr.'s dad buy me off.

93
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,880
他某天來找我
He just came to me one day

94
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,610
說  "丹尼爾  我吊得很

95
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,610
我在休斯頓有間報館  你來為我工作吧"
I have a newspaper in Houston. I want you to work for me."

96
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,310
你答應了
And you said yes.

97
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,860
我答應了
I said yes.

98
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,990
我想都沒想就答應了
I said yes so fa... I didn't even hesitate.

99
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,210
絲毫沒有遲疑
I said yes in two seconds flat.

100
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,860
-所以桑迪才裝作不認識你  -是嗎
- That's why Santi pretended he didn't know you. - Oh, yeah?

101
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,050
他跟我撇清關系
He big-timed me?

102
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,810
-逼養的  -真討厭跟醉酒的你說話
- Cooze. - I hate talking to you when you're drunk.

103
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,130
隨便啦
Oh, well.

104
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,140
你可以做出改變
You can change.

105
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,360
我試過了  顯然我做不到
I tried... but obviously, I can't.

106
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,620
明早七點有個戒酒會  就在這條街
There's a meeting tomorrow, 7:00 a.m down the street.

107
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,580
滾他娘的十二步戒酒法
12 Steps can suck my dick.

108
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,810
讓別人幫你吧
Let people help you.

109
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,680
我陪你一起去
Meet me. I'll go with you.

110
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,770
也許我就你一個真心朋友
You might be my only real friend.

111
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,990
太可悲了
That's pathetic.

112
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,890
七點見
7:00 a.m.

113
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,930
-你假裝是潔娜給我發短信  -沒錯
- You texted me saying you were Zina. - Right.

114
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,450
你讓我再給他一次機會
And you told me to give him another chance.

115
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,370
是的
I did.

116
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,980
我真的不懂
So I do not understand.

117
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,540
迦勒也是
Neither did Caleb.

118
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,030
-阿爾瑪  -馬可
- Alma. - Marco.

119
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,130
格斯呢

120
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,860
還是不知下落

121
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,820
快收拾一下你和孩子們的行李

122
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,010
我要帶你們去埃爾帕索

123
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,990
我爸和兄弟們要來接我們

124
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,420
跟他們待在一起很安全

125
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,260
他們不會想見到你的

126
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,850
阿爾瑪
Alma.

127
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,780
拜托

128
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,960
他差點就殺了你兩個女兒  馬可

129
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,140
但我阻止了他  她們也都好好的

130
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,960
我們沒事是因為他不想殺我們

131
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,030
現在沒時間說這個

132
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,160
不能再浪費時間了  我們隨后再聊

133
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,790
我不懂

134
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,050
為什么是我們

135
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,010
你們不是朋友嗎

136
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,490
因為我把他老婆睡了

137
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,640
行了吧

138
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,120
但那時我還沒跟你在一起

139
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,250
那時我還不認識你

140
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,210
但你們是朋友啊

141
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,660
但他們當時吵架了  他們發生了爭執

142
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,320
然后她就發生了意外

143
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,800
在她來找我的路上

144
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,960
我對發生在你身上的事非常抱歉

145
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,160
找到格斯

146
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,040
阿爾瑪
Alma..

147
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,860
你還想讓我說什么  馬可

148
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,170
你能活下來很幸運
You're lucky to b alive.

149
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,430
撕裂的傷口很長  但是沒傷到器官
That laceration is long, but it didn't damage any of the organs.

150
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,820
那我的胳膊呢
And my arm?

151
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,370
橈骨骨折了  很嚴重
You fractured the radius badly.

152
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,950
-我胳膊動不了了  -能感覺到嗎
- I can't move it. - Can you feel it?

153
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,810
只是因為腫脹而已  還疼嗎
That's just the swelling. How's the pain?

154
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:23,920
還疼
It's there.

155
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,640
我們給你帶了點東西來
We brought you some things.

156
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,120
預后是什么
What's the prognosis?

157
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,920
她胳膊需要動手術
Well, she's gonna need surgery on the arm.

158
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,440
近期是不行了
That's not possible anytime soon.

159
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,880
你不能走  桑婭  你差點就送了命
You can't leave, Sonya-- you nearly died.

160
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,830
你不是說我很幸運嗎
I thought you said I was lucky.

161
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,000
我說你能活下來很幸運
I said lucky to b alive.

162
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,620
你流了很多血...
You've had a lot of blood loss...

163
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,490
醫生  我們能單獨待一會兒嗎
Doc, could we have a minute, please.

164
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,680
-好  -謝謝
- Sure. - All right.

165
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,830
你應該聽從她的建議的
You know, maybe yo ought to listen to her.

166
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,120
格斯有消息了嗎
Anything on Gus?

167
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,500
沒有  馬可正在把阿爾瑪轉移到安全的地方
Nope. Marco's getting Alma somewhere safe.

168
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,650
能幫我一下嗎
Can you help me with these?

169
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,070
當然了  你坐下
Sure, babe. Sit yourself down.

170
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,750
你該留下住院的
You should stay here.

171
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,640
我不能留下  格斯還活著
You know I can't do that. Gus is alive.

172
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,980
何以見得
Why do you say that?

173
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,780
他想讓馬可痛苦
He wants Marco to suffer.

174
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,550
他想讓他也經歷一下
He wants to draw it out.

175
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,450
維柯丁[止痛藥]  很有效
Vicodin. It-it's good.

176
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,160
好  謝謝你向我們吐露心聲  肖恩
Okay. Okay, thanks, Shaun, for trusting us with that.

177
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,130
今天我們這里來了新人
We have a new face with us this morning.

178
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,070
你想讓我  也來一遍嗎
You want me to do... do the whole thing?

179
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,660
-對  -天哪
- Yeah, yeah. -My God.

180
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,680
好吧  我叫丹尼爾
Um... okay. My name is Daniel.

181
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,070
如果你們叫我丹的話  我會殺了你們的
If you almost call me Dan, the I'll kill you.

182
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,910
太棒了  謝謝你講了
Stripes. Um, thank you for telling me

183
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,810
一個非常讓人郁悶的故事  肖恩
that deeply depressing story, Shaun.

184
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,580
說實話你讓我自我感覺很良好
You actually make me feel really good about myself,

185
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,530
這點很棒
so that was awesome.

186
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,100
我大約90分鐘前剛喝了最后一杯酒
Um, I had my last drink about 90 minutes ago

187
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,490
味道很不錯
and it was delicious.

188
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,090
好吧
Okay.

189
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,220
我不知道你們都是怎么做到的
I don't know how you guys do what you do.

190
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,800
對我來說幾乎是不可能的事
It just seems kind of impossible to me.

191
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,840
我嘗試了
I tried.

192
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,180
我努力了  但我把自己逼得太緊
I try so hard, and then just, I get so far

193
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,040
結果又搞砸了  當新的問題出現時
and then shit the bed and something happens,

194
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,920
我只好選擇灌醉自己
and I just get hammered,

195
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,700
那樣日子就過得容易多了
and life is so much better when you're hammered.

196
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,290
但在我生命中
But I have...

197
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,640
仍然有一位好友覺得我可以改過自新
I have cool people in my life who think I can change.

198
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,780
我見到了許多出色的人
I see a lot of cool people,

199
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,870
謝謝你
thank you,

200
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:14,670
你們讓我再一次相信自己
who let me believe in myself.

201
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,050
所以  謝謝你們
So, thanks for that.

202
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,410
天哪
Oh, God.

203
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,470
不管了
So, whatever.

204
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,710
我沒帶表  但是
I don't have a watch or anything, but, uh, look.

205
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,500
現在是8點22分
It is 8:22...

206
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,200
從現在起我會再試一次
and, uh, from this point on I'm gonna give it a shot.

207
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,400
我不知道能堅持多久
I don't know how it's gonna go but...

208
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,200
但我會努力嘗試
Shit, I'll give it a shot.

209
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,440
就這樣
Okay.

210
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,270
剛才說的真感人啊
How touching that all was.

211
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,290
大家注意  這些是從戴維·泰特公寓
All right, gang. This is the haul from

212
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,130
搜出來的材料  每個受害者一堆
David Tate's apartment. One pile per victim.

213
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,820
抓緊時間  但一定要仔細
Be quick, but be diligent.

214
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,850
這些東西對我兒子有什么幫助
How does that help my son?

215
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,480
他作案很有計劃
We know he's methodical.

216
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,350
如果抓走你兒子是其中一環
If there's a plan for your boy,

217
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,540
這里面一定有些蛛絲馬跡
it's in here somewhere.

218
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,850
你也沒法確定
You don't know that.

219
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,430
但幾率最大
I know it's our best bet.

220
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,160
車牌調查得怎么樣了
Anything on the license plate?

221
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,850
還沒消息
No, ma'am, not yet.

222
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,770
-你還好吧  -沒事
- You okay? - Yeah.

223
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,710
好吧  這有丹尼爾·弗萊的汽車爆炸案
All right. Got Daniel Frye's car bomb here.

224
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,080
蓋德曼謀殺案  梅多斯醫生謀殺案
Gedman's murder. Dr. Meadow's murder.

225
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,300
你在流血
You're bleeding.

226
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,750
是的
Yes.

227
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,320
一切都弄砸了
Everything is coming apart.

228
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,250
格斯的事我很抱歉
I'm sorry about Gus.

229
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,720
抱歉我沒能保護好他
I'm sorry I couldn't protect him.

230
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,530
你已經盡力了
There was nothing you could do.

231
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,040
但這是我的職責  你叫我保護好他的
But it was... it was my job, and you asked me to keep him safe,

232
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,920
但我沒能做到  對不起  我盡力了
and I, and I didn't. I'm sorry. I tried.

233
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,590
過來一下
Come here.

234
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,920
-這些是什么  -我們沒弄明白的文件
- What are these? - These are documents we can't connect...

235
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,570
-你上一次睡覺是什么時候  -誰知道
- When did you last sleep?  - Uh, who knows?

236
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,570
-你狀態很不好  -我沒事
- You're not yourself. - I'm fine.

237
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,490
我必須得問你
I'm required to ask.

238
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,900
你確定不需要休息一下
Are you sure you don't need to step away?

239
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,380
這混蛋抓了我兒子  漢克

240
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,550
如果有人抓了你兒子你會怎樣
What would you do if someone had your son?

241
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,520
巡警發現了那輛車
Uniforms found the car.

242
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,460
快去
Go. Go, go, go, go.

243
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,760
不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no.

244
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,660
一小時前掘墓人發現它停在這里
Gravedigger found it out here an hour ago.

245
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,990
-里面沒東西嗎  -操作手冊  收據
- Nothing inside? - Manual, receipts,

246
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,550
雜物箱里還有些別的東西
a few things in the glove box.

247
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,380
馬可
Marco!

248
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,360
馬可  這不是他
Marco. It's not him.

249
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,190
這不是格斯  只是個墳墓
It's not Gus. It's just a grave!

250
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,760
他在耍你
He's playing with you.

251
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,330
我是個男人  是個父親
I am a man. A father.

252
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,020
這不是兒戲
This is not a game.

253
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,830
我明白  好了  快起來
I know.Come on, get up.

254
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,230
我們不會放棄的  好嗎  走吧
We won't stop, okay? Let's go.

255
00:19:51,850 --> 00:20:01,730
埃爾帕索  州法院

256
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,050
好了  是有點麻煩
Okay. Kind of a curveball.

257
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,710
麻煩大了去了
A curve-up-my-ass ball.

258
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,500
我覺得也沒那么嚴重
More like a slider then, I guess.

259
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,130
他什么都沒留給我
He left me nothing.

260
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,740
他把房子和土地留給你了
He left you the house and land.

261
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,580
錢  車  藝術品  家具全歸凱特了
Kate got the money, the cars, the art, the furniture.

262
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,400
我都說了  你得到了土地和隧道
I repeat, you got the land and the tunnel.

263
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,680
庭審真是很順利啊
That went super well, I thought.

264
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,480
你還真是善于離間我和你爸啊  凱特	
You did a really good job of turning him against me, Kate.

265
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,610
其實有一天
So... this one time,

266
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,430
我爸半夜給我打電話
my dad calls me up in the middle of the night.

267
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,090
我問他出什么事了
And I-I ask him what's up, you know?

268
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,010
他說  不過是又和那個蠢女人過了一天罷了
He says, "Oh... it's jus another day married to an idiot."

269
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,510
那是八年前的事了
That was eight years ago.

270
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,650
所以讓他疏遠你的人  是你自己
Pretty sure you turned him against you.

271
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,920
-別了  賤人  -再見  凱特
- Bye, whore. - Adios, Kate

272
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,480
別理她
Forget her

273
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,260
看著我  別理她  隧道是我們的
Look at me, forget her We've got the tunnel

274
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,940
不是嗎  今天下午我們去把蒂姆的事解決了
Okay? We solve the Tim problem this afternoon,

275
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,860
好好嚇唬一下他  然后就沒事了
we put the fear of God in him,  and then we'll be fine.

276
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,050
韋德副隊長
Lieutenant Wade?

277
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,680
在  但我們現在有點忙
Yeah, we're kind of busy right now.

278
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,150
丹尼爾·弗萊失蹤了
Daniel Frye is missing.

279
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,090
-他不是個酒鬼嗎  -不是的
- He's an addict, right? - It's not like that.

280
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,210
我們一起去參加戒酒會  我覺得
We were at an AA meeting, an I don't...

281
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,990
我覺得把車開走的  不是他本人
I don't think it was him that drove his car away.

282
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,350
是嗎  那是誰開走的
Yeah? Who was it?

283
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,920
丹尼爾幫忙包庇了那場肇事逃逸
Daniel helped cover up the hit-and-run.

284
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,860
就是戴維·泰特家的那場事故
David Tate's family.

285
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,630
他說正因為這樣兇手才一直針對他
He told me that's why he's been target all this time.

286
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,180
該死
Damn.

287
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,350
停車罰單
Parking ticket.

288
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,120
就是尸體被遺棄在橋上的那一天早上
From the morning the bodies were left on the bridge.

289
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,950
那是計劃之外的
Not part of the plan.

290
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,130
這上面的地址不是他的公寓  是別的地方
This is not his apartment address. It's something else.

291
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,680
快走  路上再請求支援
Come on. We'll call it in on the way.

292
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,820
有人嗎  有人嗎
Hello? Hello?

293
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,730
有人嗎
Hello?

294
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,810
有沒有人啊
Is anybody there?!

295
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,600
有沒有人啊
Is anybody there?!

296
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,430
"青春永駐"療養院
1962年  埃爾帕索  德克薩斯州

297
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,370
我認識這個人  他會定期來看一位病人
I'm sure of it. He visits one of our residents.

298
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,220
大概隔幾周來一次
I'd say every few weeks.

299
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,180
-哪位病人  -錢伯斯先生
- Which resident? - Mr. Chambers.

300
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,780
他現在應該在會客廳
He's probably in the parlor.

301
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,470
是個大好人  和善  心腸也好
He's a nice man. Warm, kind.

302
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,850
您認識他嗎
Do you know who he is?

303
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:16,030
當然了  他是我父親
Of course. He's my father.

304
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,340
資料里有沃爾特·錢伯斯的家庭住址
Walter Chambers has home address on file.

305
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,240
戴維提到過他的叔叔患有老年癡呆
David once said his uncle had alzheimer's.

306
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,490
戴維·泰特那天來過這里  快走
David Tate was here that day. Come on.

307
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,490
你在干什么
What are you doing?

308
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,240
如果找不到格斯怎么辦
What if we can't find him?

309
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,620
-會找到的  -你怎么能肯定
- We will. - You can't say that.

310
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:35,060
我們倆曾經很多年沒有交流
We... hadn't really talked for years,

311
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,720
突然間  他又回到我身邊
and then suddenly he was back in my life.

312
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,370
我們之前還聊了很多
We just talked about..

313
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,570
說起我一直不能多陪陪他
how I wasn't there for him enough.

314
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,090
以及我會如何盡力地
And how I'd try to...

315
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,550
彌補這一切
do better.

316
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,800
泰特也是部分原因
Tate set that up too.

317
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:02,820
但主要還是我的錯  而現在
Still. And now I'm gonna...

318
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,700
我卻要再次失去他
and now I'm gonna lose him again.

319
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:11,090
我不敢說我們一定能找到他
I can't say we'll find him,

320
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,320
但不代表我們不會努力找
but you can't say we won't.

321
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,490
如果他不在里面呢
What if he's not inside.

322
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,810
那就接著找
We'll keep looking.

323
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,190
埃爾帕索警察  快開門
El Paso P.D. Open the door!

324
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,810
這就是他存放克里斯蒂娜的腿的地方
That's where he kept Cristina's legs.

325
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,200
格斯
Gus?

326
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,610
-不是  -我的天啊  戴維
- No. - Jesus, David.

327
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,440
格斯長得挺帥的
He's a good-looking kid, Gus.

328
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,700
離他遠點  只管沖著我來
Leave him alone. Take it out on me.

329
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,140
我不是正在這么做嗎
Well, isn't that what I'm doing?

330
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,380
至少讓我跟他說句話
Let me talk to him at least.

331
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,860
這不可能
That's not possible.

332
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,170
-他還活著嗎  -暫時活著
- Is he alive? - For now.

333
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,730
我本以為我們會相處得很好
I thought we'd get together.

334
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,720
你為什么要這么做
Why are you doing this?

335
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,480
因為我很生氣  想跟你談談
Because I'm angry, and I want to talk about it.

336
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,270
好
All right.

337
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,750
沒問題  在哪里
Fine. Where?

338
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,600
-你現在在哪  -在你叔叔的家里
- Where are you now? - At your uncle's house.

339
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,540
在聽嗎
Hello?

340
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,740
我告訴過你的那些事  你竟然還記得
You actually remembered something I told you about myself.

341
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,640
-我們找到那個冰柜了  -我們?
- We found the freezer. - We?

342
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,320
是的  桑婭和我在一起
Yes. Sonya's here with me.

343
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,520
是嗎  她怎么樣
Really? How is she?

344
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,810
-很憔悴吧  -她很好
- Probably pretty pale. - She's fine.

345
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,470
我本來還想問
I've been meaning to ask her

346
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,850
她對杰克·柴德里斯這種人作何感想
how she enjoy getting to know Jack Childress.

347
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,600
那人對于邊境的看法可真是夠瘋狂的  對吧
That man has some bat shit theories on the border, doesn' he?

348
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,590
戴維  我們到底在哪里碰面
Where are we meeting, David?

349
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,080
先上車  一分鐘后打給你
Get in your car. I'll call you in 60 seconds,

350
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,130
再告訴你怎么走
give you directions.

351
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,050
好的
All right.

352
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,240
一個人來  絕對不要帶上她
Come alone. Entirely alone, leave her.

353
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,520
我會的
I will.

354
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,610
你不能這樣做  完全是順著他的意
You can't do that. You're doing exactly what he wants.

355
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,140
-把你的槍給我  -不
- Give me your gun. - No.

356
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,960
-求你了  -不  如果你殺了他
- Please. - No. If you kill him, you...

357
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,020
你會坐牢的
you're gonna end up in prison.

358
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:14,190
桑婭  我需要你的槍  求你了
Sonya, I need your gun. Please.

359
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:24,250
謝謝  別告訴任何人我去哪了
Thank you. Don't tell anyone where I went.

360
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,280
那我要怎么說
What do I say?

361
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,050
就說  我接到了一個電話  撇下你先走了
Just... that I got a call, and, uh... I left you here.

362
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,460
-我不能對漢克撒謊  -你可以的
- I can't lie to Hank. - Oh, yes, you can.

363
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,960
-不  不行  -很簡單
- No, I can't. - It's easy.

364
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,010
就當為了我  好嗎
Do it for me. All right?

365
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,350
喂
Hello?

366
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,210
得有人來接我一下
I need a ride.

367
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,080
注意兒童

368
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,670
冰激凌

369
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,930
-小蒂  -雷
- Timbo. - Ray!

370
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,720
-小夏  -我們來這里做什么
- Char. - So what are we doing here?

371
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,900
你這話什么意思
What do you mean by that?

372
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,500
兄弟  這可是鳥不拉屎的地方
Dude, We're on freakin' Mars, right now.

373
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,530
我們覺得這事在荒郊野嶺辦最合適
We thought a remote area would be best.

374
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,970
好吧
Okay.

375
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,700
迪內羅在哪里
Where's the dinero?

376
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,700
[西班牙發行的一種銀幣  已退出流通]

377
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,750
你這是發什么瘋啊
Look, what-what's going on, crazies?

378
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,200
跪下
Get on your knees.

379
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,270
什么
Wh...?

380
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:18,160
-我們找到了這個  -這是什么鬼東西
- We found this. - What the heck is it?

381
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,950
是信號發射器  你這個蠢豬
It's a transmitter, dipshit.

382
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,340
在那些槍中找到的
It was in one of those guns.

383
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,580
不  不是的  別誤會  沒什么大不了
Aw, no, no, no, no, no,no, no, that's-that's nothing.

384
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,260
工廠組裝的時候放進去的
They put those things in the at-at the factory.

385
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,280
別再騙我了
Don't even try.

386
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,860
你根本不知道這玩意給我惹了多大麻煩
You have no idea the shit storm you caused me.

387
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,080
怎么了  你跪舔過的女人追著你來了
Okay, what? The lady you muff-dov come-come after you, what?

388
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,440
我不知道你在說什么
I don't even know what that means.

389
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,060
-到底是什么政府部門  -什么
- What part of the government? - Excuse me?

390
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,450
你到底給誰提供信息
For whom are you an informant.

391
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,900
蒂姆  你不說的話
I will get in my truck, Tim,

392
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,470
我就開車從你身上碾過去  我說到做到
and I will run you over. I swear.

393
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:52,150
好吧  好吧  真的很抱歉
Okay, okay, look Look, I'm sorry, okay?

394
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,250
伙計們  我被抓住了把柄
Guys, I just got caught up in something.

395
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,270
你現在帶著竊聽器嗎
Are you wire right now?

396
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,430
絕對沒有  你看
No. No, no, no, no. No, see?

397
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,350
他們連我在哪都不知道
They-they-they don't even know where I am.

398
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,900
煙酒槍炮及爆裂物管理局  就像一盤散沙
ATF, they're, like, so disorganized,

399
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,650
好像把我忘了似的
it's lik they-they forget about me.

400
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,780
煙酒槍炮及爆裂物管理局
The ATF?

401
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,860
殺了他
Shoot him.

402
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,940
我以為你只是想嚇嚇他
I thought you said we were gonna scare him.

403
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,240
我改主意了
I changed my mind.

404
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,970
-開槍  -我下不了手
- Do it. - I don't think I can.

405
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,970
我們從小玩到大的
We used to play kickball together.

406
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,410
求求你們了  小夏  求你了  是我呀
Guys, it's... come on, Char, dude, it's me.

407
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:35,180
我們一起開著露營車去畢業舞會
We-we-we took an RV to our prom together.

408
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,690
他說的對
He has a point.

409
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,400
你穿著藍緞子禮服  頭上戴著一朵白色的花
Blue satin. Big white flower in your hair.

410
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,520
把槍給我
Give it to me.

411
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,180
-小夏  -什么
- Char.. - Wha...?

412

415
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,130
-冷靜點  -你叫我怎么冷靜
- Calm down. - Calm down?

416
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,920
你殺了蒂姆
You killed Tim.

417
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,690
他是我們的伙伴啊
He was our buddy.

418
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,610
你妻子怎么樣
How's your wife?

419
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:23,780
別提起她
Don't talk about her.

420
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:28,510
我和她睡過了  你知道嗎
I had sex with her. Did you know that?

421
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,700
你在撒謊
You're lying.

422
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,450
我真是被她的饑渴嚇到了
What surprised me was the vigor.

423
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,810
我親了她一下
I mean, after that first kiss,

424
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:39,350
她就開始熱烈地回應我
she really threw herself into it.

425
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,300
我要開到哪去
Where am I driving?

426
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,460
她活下來很正常  并不是她的錯
It's okay that she survived I mean, it-it wasn't her fault.

427
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,950
也不是格斯的錯
It's not Gus's fault either.

428
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,410
沒錯  但他是你兒子
No, but he's you son.

429
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,850
就像迦勒是我兒子一樣
Like Caleb was mine.

430
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,400
戴維  你到底要我去哪
Where am I going, David?

431
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,130
富蘭克林山公園
Franklin Mountain Park.

432
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,000
你們在我家上過床嗎
Did you do it at my house?

433
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,900
上過
Yes.

434
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,870
在我床上  和我老婆
In my bed with my wife.

435
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,000
你當時打算怎么做
What was your plan?

436
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,950
我沒有計劃
I didn't have one.

437
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,300
那你覺得只要我沒發現就沒事是嗎
Did you think it was okay as long as I didn't find out?

438
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,510
不是的
No.

439
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,270
想過要告訴我嗎
Did you even think about telling me?

440
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:28,070
-沒有  -沒錯  你就是隨心所欲
- No. - No, you just wanted what you wanted.

441
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,920
才不在乎會傷害到別人
Who cares who it hurts?

442
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,840
我快到公園了
I'm getting to the park.

443
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,930
J號停車場  靠近采石場
Lot J, near the quarry.

444
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,660
馬可在哪
Hey, where's Marco?

445
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,470
不知道  他接了個電話就走了
I don't know.He got a call and left.

446
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,210
誰打給他的
Got a call from who?

447
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,620
你臉色不好
You don't look good.

448
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,110
沒什么
Oh, it's-it's nothing.

449
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,600
好吧  過來  坐下
Okay, come on. Sit down.

450
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,540
你得吃點東西
You need to eat.

451
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,030
-我不喜歡吃香蕉  -顧不了這么多了
- I don't like bananas. - That doesn't matter.

452
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,040
你現在本來是要手術的
You supposed to be on an operating table right now.

453
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,230
我理解為什么你不想做手術
And I understand why you're not,

454
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,270
但如果你太虛弱  生病了或傷勢加重
but you will be of no help to Marco and his boy

455
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,760
那就什么忙也幫不了馬可和他兒子
if you faint or get sick or get hurt even worse.

456
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,460
我得繼續調查
I need to keep looking.

457
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,300
我知道
I know.

458
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,020
我們肯定漏掉什么了
I know we're missing something.

459
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,100
就在那些文件里  我肯定
It's in those documents. I know it.

460
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,490
明白  先把它喝了
Okay. Just drink that.

461
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,740
再接著調查
And then back at it.

462
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,810
好久不見啊  老朋友
Well, hello there. Old friend.

463
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,400
住手
Stop.

464
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,910
他在哪
Where is he?

465
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,080
他在哪
Where is he?

466
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,790
作為警察  這種感覺挺特別吧
Strange feeling for a cop, isn't it?

467
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,730
那種無力感
To be powerless?

468
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,370
丹尼爾·弗萊的車
Daniel Frye's?

469
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,300
看來你還真是做警探的料啊
That's some amazing detective work.

470
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,910
你把他也殺了
You kill him, too?

471
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,010
你有想起過我嗎
Have you thought about me much?

472
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,920
在我自殺后
Since my suicide?

473
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,280
沒有
Not much.

474
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,540
你知道我當時崩潰了吧
You knew I was crumble, right?

475
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,900
就在她死后
After she died.

476
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,900
心理醫生讓我對藥物上癮
A shrink had me hooked on pills.

477
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,250
調查局把我開除了
The FBI fired me.

478
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,040
我聽說了
I heard.

479
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,870
但沒給我打過一個電話
But not one phone call.

480
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,100
我們失去聯絡了
We were out of touch.

481
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,750
再見面的方式很有趣
Funny how that happens.

482
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,260
上車
Get in the car.

483
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,890
是她選擇了我  戴維
She chose me, David.

484
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,930
你做這么多就是因為她選的是我
All of this because she chose me?

485
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,410
沒錯
Yes.

486
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,610
你殺了這么多人就是因為你老婆拋棄了你
You killed all these people because your wife left you?

487
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,630
她是從我身邊被奪走的
She was taken from me.

488
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,100
失去一切的又不只有你一個人
You're not the first person to lose everything.

489
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,890
那邊這樣的事情每天都在發生
Over there it happens every day!

490
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,880
很多人的生活都變得支離破碎
People have their lives ripped away from them.

491
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,950
可他們也沒去殺人啊
It doesn't make them killers.

492
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,680
可能我比較特別吧
Maybe I'm special.

493
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,490
你才不特別呢
You... you're not.

494
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,150
把手機扔了
Get rid of you phone.

495
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,770
帶槍了嗎
You have a gun?

496
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,160
-帶了  -很好
- Yes. - Good.

497
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,060
我來開車
I'll drive.
