我本该说些什么
I should have said something.

Yeah, fill her full of grog and get her laid, that's...

78
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
我只想说
All I'm saying is

79
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:59,319
你应该确定好情况再发报道
you really want to be sure about this before you file it.

80

It's not really the place for a white girl to ask questions though, is it?

大多数时候 是没关系的

你觉得安吉惹上麻烦了?

and I'll help you find out if trouble found Angie.

133
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,920
美好的一天啊 不是吗 哈里森?
Lovely day, isn't it, Harrison?

134
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,960
不不不 我们不这么做
Oh, no, no, no. We don't do it like that.

135
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,080
我们看看海鲜 挑选我们中意的鱼
We look at the seafood, we select the fish of our choice.

136
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,240
嘿 看那一条
Hey, look at that one.

137
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,600
很美味
Yum-yum. Mmm.

138
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,280
我们聊聊蟋蟀
We talk about the cricket.

139
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,200
当然 不是会钻箱子那种
Well, not in your case.

140
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,453
我们两位绅士在充满异域情调的
Um... We're two gentlemen taking 

141
00:09:33,454 --> 00:09:35,000
亚洲风光下聊天
in the exotic Asian surrounds.

142
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,400
我们能不能赶紧完事儿?
Can we just get this over and done with?

143
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,360
好吧 有个问题
Well, therein lies the problem.

144
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,320
我能说这是一个哲学问题吗?
May I suggest it's a philosophical problem?

145
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,280
你得喜欢你做的事 哈里森
You've got to love what you do, Harrison.

146
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,400
既然做了就要喜欢它 要么就不做
Either do something and embrace it, or don't do it at all.

147
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,036
如果你做一些自己讨厌的事 
If you do something you hate, 

148
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:56,560
它会从内心消耗你
it'll eat you up from the inside.

149
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,480
好的 谢谢 我会记住的
OK, thank you. I'll, er, I'll keep that in mind.

150
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,520
哈里森?
Ah, Harrison?

151
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,040
还有一件小事需要你帮我做
There is one more little thing you can do for me.

152
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,360
越南
Vietnam.

153
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,960
越南?
Vietnam?

154
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,000
那是国家安全委员会的机密文件
That's NSC-classified material.

155
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,080
如果我要去拿那个文件
If I were to get that information,

156
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,880
我就得潜入怀尔德・比尔的办公室
I'd have to break into Wild Bill's office.

157
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,080
这个任务对你来说肯定不在话下
Well, a challenge surely within your skill set.

158
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,120
获取新加坡情报 这事我能办到
Sharing intel on Singapore, that's one thing.

159
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,640
但是越南?
But Vietnam?

160
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,600
不管怎样我们都会拿到这个情报的
Well, it's information we're going to get anyway.

161
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,405
怀尔德・比尔可能在月底前
Wild Bill will probably tell me 

162
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:43,640
就会告诉我这个情报
by the end of the month.

163
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,040
那你为什么不直接去问他呢?
Well, why don't you just ask him, then?

164
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,898
怀尔德・比尔做事太老派 
Wild Bill is old-school. 

165
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,880
而你和我 我们引领的是新潮流
You and me, we're the new wave.

166
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,560
我们办事当机立断 直截了当
We can get things done on the ground, mano a mano,

167
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,840
犯不着跟官僚纠缠
without being tangled up in bureaucracy.

168
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,960
你知道 你没必要威胁我
You know, you don't have to blackmail me.

169
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,080
你把苏玲的资料给我
You could just give me the file on Su Ling

170
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,120
我就会按你所说的做
and I would do what you request anyway.

171
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,680
行啊
Well, I could,

172
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,320
但有时候人需要被指引才会做正确的事情
but sometimes people need to be helped to do the right thing.

173
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,440
安委会的报告 尽快拿到 明白了吗?
That NSC report, as soon as you can, alright?

174
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,600
我就要这条了 谢谢
Ah, I'll take this one, please.

175
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,080
我知道一个事实 温斯顿在被谋杀前
I know for a fact that Winston was fearing for his life

176
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,040
很担心他的生命安全
before he was murdered.

177
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,760
所以你说错了 这不是一次随机抢劫
So this was not a random robbery like you said.

178
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,120
我可以看下那个案件的资料吗?
Is it possible for me to take a look at the case notes?

179
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,840
- 郑太太 - 我真的需要看下那个材料
- Mrs Cheng. - I really do need to look at them.

180
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,720
我不想让你们遗漏任何细节
I don't want you to have missed anything.

181
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,920
郑太太 抱歉 我们不能这样做
Mrs Cheng, I'm sorry. That's not the way we work.

182
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,400
那你们怎么做?
What is the way you work?

183
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,000
我丈夫在你管辖的区域内被谋杀
My husband was murdered on your streets.

184
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,280
什么进展都没有
Nothing has been done about it.

185
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,100
杀害他的凶手还逍遥法外 
His killer is out there, 

186
00:11:56,101 --> 00:11:57,760
吃喝玩乐 过着潇洒的生活
laughing, drinking, living his life

187
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,120
而温斯顿却只能长眠地下
while Winston lies in his grave.

188
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,640
你让我怎么能安心入眠?
How do you suppose I sleep at night?

189
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,840
你只能在这里看材料
They can't leave the station.

190
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,200
霍克
Ah, Hock.

191
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,920
温斯顿・郑的材料
Winston Cheng's file.

192
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,720
郑太太
Ah, Mrs Cheng.

193
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,840
很抱歉 您丈夫的材料好像不见了
I'm very sorry, but your husband's file appears to be missing.

194
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,640
这是什么意思?
What does that mean?

195
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,440
安吉的公寓就在这里
Angie's apartment is just here.

196
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,400
门上锁了
The door's locked.

197
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,280
别 别想了 老兄
No, don't even think about it, man.

198
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,560
你总是小瞧我
You always underestimate me.

199
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
才没 我总是高估你
No, I overestimate you.

200
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,920
我觉得你会做得更聪明一点 更低调一点
I think you will do something smarter, and quieter.

201
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,120
更安全一点!
Safer!

202
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
不是吧
Come on.

203
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,400
哇哦!
Whoa!

204
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,440
别动 好吗? 别动
Relax, OK? Just relax.

205
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,760
为什么你不拦住他?
Why didn't you stop him?

206
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,800
你以为我没拦么?
What do you think I was doing?

207
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,600
别担心 下次再见到他 我就认出来了
Don't worry. I see him again, I'll know him.

208
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,840
- 是吗? - 没错
- Yeah? - Yeah.

209
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
什么掉了?


210
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,840
是他耳朵啦


211
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
他到底在找什么呢?
What was he looking for, anyway?

212
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,720
嘿! 拿着啦! 嘿!
Hey! Hey, hold it, lah! Hey!

213
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,720
嘿
Hey.

214
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,960
这些都是什么?
What is all that?

215
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,960
看起来像监视时拍的照片
They look like surveillance photos.

216
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,480
找到一个写满名字和数字的名单
It's a list of names and numbers.

217
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,240
肯定是她在调查的东西
Must be something she was working on.

218
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,880
嘿
Hey.

219
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,120
不管那人找的是什么 肯定不是钱
Whatever that guy was looking for, it's definitely not money.

220
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,440
他肯定在找什么东西
He was definitely looking for something.

221
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,600
康
Kang.

222
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,760
嗯?
Hmm?

223
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,800
是大麻
It's hash.

224
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,520
迈卡
Macca.

225
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,080
没空呢 山姆
Not now, Sam.

226
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
我得把这个先打完
I've really got to get this filed.

227
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,400
她在写什么呢 迈卡?
What was she writing, Macca?

228
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,840
她家里到处都是照片 名字和数字
She had photos, names and numbers everywhere.

229
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,360
可我从没看见一份报道
I never saw a story.

230
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,960
她把东西给我了 只是草稿
No, she gave it to me. Rough draft, anyway.

231
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,360
是什么呢?
What was it?

232
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,040
她痴迷于秘密帮派
She was obsessed with the Secret Societies.

233
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,680
想追踪新加坡毒品的交易链
Wanted to track the movement of drugs through Singapore.

234
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,880
我告诉她这事儿没戏
I told her it was a dead-end story.

235
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,800
证据难找 也没证人 就别做了
Hard to prove, no-one to talk to, and to let it go.

236
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,280
她放弃了吗?
Did she?

237
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,760
山姆 这跟你朋友刺杀她又没关系
Sam, this has got nothing to do with your mate stabbing her.

238
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,480
毒品报道跟这无关
The drug story is irrelevant.

239
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,480
那为什么她家里会藏有
Then why was she hiding a trafficable amount of hash

240
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,960
可供买卖量的大麻呢?
in her apartment?

241
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,520
安吉不会沾染毒品的 她不喜欢
Ange would never touch drugs. She hated them.

242
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,800
她只想成为记者
All she ever wanted was to be a journo.

243
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,560
还是去问你朋友大麻是怎么进她家的吧
So you ask your mate how that hash got into her place.

244
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,800
- 得了吧 - 接着说
- Oh, come on. - Go on.

245
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
我敢说十有八九毒品是他的
I'll give you ten to one it's his.

246
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,680
他肯定也不会承认
And I'll give you five to one that he lies about it.

247
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,080
而且我确定不管怎样你都会相信他
And I'll give you even money that you'll believe him anyway.

248
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,480
是啊 无所谓了
Yeah, whatever.

249
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,760
不 当然不是
No, absolutely not.

250
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,000
所以你从没在新加坡进行大麻交易?
So you never moved hash in and out of Singapore?

251
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,880
跟我发誓毒品的事跟你无关
Swear to me you're not involved in drugs.

252
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
我发誓 真没有
I swear. Never.

253
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,480
因为我看到一个记者
'Cause I'm looking at a reporter

254
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,520
在调查港口的毒品交易
investigating the drug trade on the docks,

255
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,680
也跟一个跑货船的男人在一起
hanging out with a guy who works on freighters.

256
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,200
这都说得通 对吧?
It all adds up, doesn't it?

257
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,640
她的确问了我关于毒品的问题
Well, she asked me questions about it, sure.

258
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,680
我们就是这样见面的
I mean, that's how we met.

259
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,960
她在那里跟船员和港口人员交谈
She's down there talking to sailors and dockies.

260
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,200
那些人嘴巴很严 不干活的时候也不多话
Those blokes don't talk, even if they're not moving stuff.

261
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,420
山姆 如果你想要放弃这个案子我也能理解
Sam, I can understand if you wanna give up.

262
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,120
告诉我这不是你干的
Tell me you didn't do this.

263
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,560
这不是我干的
I didn't do this.

264
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,440
但你也不记得了
But you can't remember.

265
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,360
对
No.

266
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,880
也许这里有什么猫腻 有些互动
Maybe there's something in here, some kind of contact.

267
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,920
我是说 她在挖掘毒品交易内幕
I mean, she's digging into the drug trade.

268
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,040
可能她走得比迈卡想得还远
Maybe she got further than Macca thought.

269
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,400
你是说她在跟踪这个事情 太过头了
You're saying she was following a story, got too close,

270
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,360
以至于她调查的某些人把她杀了

And what about the drugs?

275
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,800
可能是调查的一部分
Maybe it was part of the investigation.

276
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,080
- 也许她自己买的 - 买那么多?

277
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,560
有没有可能你朋友在撒谎?
Is it possible you got it wrong about your friend?

278

所有人都觉得他在撒谎
Everyone thinks he did it.

279

我需要你去告诉他不要这么关注
I need you to tell him to pull his head in

306
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,880

不要因为这件事惹麻烦
So now is not the time to have

310
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,280
现在不是时候
this particular piece of excrement hitting the fan.

311
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,200
跟我相比 他可能更听你的话
Well, he's more likely to listen to you than me.

312
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,640
听着 我不是让他不写这个报道了
Look, I'm not asking him not to write the story, you know,

313
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,760
只是缓和一下
just tone it down a bit.

00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,720
那个家伙显然罪不可赦
The bloke's obviously as guilty as sin.

315

先生 我不这么认为
Sir, I don't think he is.

316
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,840
我最近在调查这个情况 我认为不是他杀了她
I've been investigating the situation and I don't think he killed her.

317
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,320
真的吗?
Really?

318
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,280
是啊 你是个侦探
Well, you're a detective

319
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,720
这事根本轮不上我班门弄斧
and far be it for me to tell you how to suck eggs,

320
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,360

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,600
他在三九年入伍

"土著战争英雄被陷害"

332
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,560
那可不是我想看到的头条
That's the last headline I want to see.

333
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,360
如果你能释放他 我就能找出事情的真相

346

闭嘴！ 你怎么回事?

347

我怎么回事? 他是凶手!
What's wrong with me? He's the killer!

348
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,520
那个人是个战士

他对国家做出的贡献比你想到的都要多

What, is this some bloody Changi thing you two got going on, is it?

352
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,880
- 什么? - 你把那次行动当作奖章
- What? - You wear that camp like a badge.

353
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,520
还是个战士? 那都是二十年前的事了
And a soldier? That was 20 years ago.

354
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,000
别说了 迈卡
Don't start, Macca.

355
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,200
他来澳洲是在逃避什么?

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,120
我能找到什么正当理由让他回家吗?

357
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,120
你知道他回去的时候发现了什么吗?

360
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,560
他为国家服役五年 军队甚至不支付他工资
Five years he served his country. The army won't even pay him.

361
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,760
不管什么样的记者都会报道他
Any sort of reporter would write that story.

362
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,480
两杯咖啡
Two coffees.

363
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,400
听起来好像是个对当局不满的人
Sounds like a man that might be a bit shitty with authority.

364
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,760
或许会觉得毒品交易是个好出路
Might find the drug trade a better way to go.

365
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,120
她在调查秘密帮派

她在码头问问题呢
She's asking questions down on the docks.

367
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,263
说不定她是被黑帮杀害的  
Maybe she was killed by a gangster.  

368
00:24:21,264 --> 00:24:22,160
你就骗自己吧
Keep telling yourself that.

369
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,160
她告诉你她在做什么了 不是吗?
She told you what she was doing, didn't she?

370
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,888
你没有阻止她 也没有警告她 
You never stopped her. You never warned her. 

371
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:27,120
你有没有读过她的文章?
You even read her story?

372
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,512
没有吧? 你根本就是懒得看  
No? You couldn't be bothered.  

373
00:24:29,513 --> 00:24:31,000
得了吧 她就是个孩子
Nah, come on, she was just a kid.

374
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,120
一个女招待 
A barmaid. 

375
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:35,000
难道她能突然间写出普利策一般的作品?
What, she's gonna suddenly write a Pulitzer piece?

376
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,560
这不是重点 或许她在调查什么东西
That's not the point. Maybe she was onto something.

377
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,400
或许这引来了杀身之祸  
Maybe that's what's got her killed.  

378
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:40,240
好啦 好啦!
Alright. Alright!

379
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,480
好啦 我会看看的
Alright, I'll read it.

380
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,000
要是我发现什么你能接受吗?

No, no, no. You no go up. No killer.

384
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,080
韩哥 不要乱讲话 山姆讲可以带他上去的


385
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,080
山姆他没有跟我讲啊


386
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
你要上去是吗?


387
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,980
先闯过我这一关


388
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,080
怎么啦?


389
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,840
这是山姆的朋友 罗伯
This is Sam's friend, Robbo.

山姆说带他到他的房间里 
Sam said to park him at his place. 

392
00:25:16,441 --> 00:25:17,640
你就是帕特丽夏吧

我得走了 得去接山姆
I really have to go. Gotta pick Sam up.

396
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,300
我带他上去


397
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,640
我可以带他上去 没有问题


398
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
莫名其妙


399
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,940
你才莫名其妙


400
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,840
你现在可以走了 没关系的
Oh, you can go now. It's alright.

401

我不会弄坏东西的
I won't nick anything.

402
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,120
倒不是说这有什么东西可弄
Not that there's much to nick.

403
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,440
我信任山姆 山姆信任你
Well, I trust Sam, and Sam trusts you.

404
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,440
但是你不信任我
But you don't trust me.

405
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,360

How is he?

406
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,320
他还好吗?
Is he alright?

407
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,400
我是说 他... 有没有朋友?
I mean, has he got... friends?

408
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,040
你是怎么认识他的 科利尔先生?
How do you know him, Mr Collier?

409
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,000
我在很久很久之前帮助过他
I helped him out a long, long time ago.

410
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,240
你要找谁 孩子?
Who are you looking for, son?

411
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,720
詹姆士・卡拉汉少校 先生

I'm sorry, son. Your father's not here.

414
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,200
两个月前 他和一个工作组出去了
Went out with a work party, two months ago.

415
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,920
再也没有回来
He never came back.

416
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,960
好吧
OK, then.

417
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,480
等等! 你要去哪里?
Wait! Where are you going?

418
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,560
爸爸说 如果有什么状况 在家里见面
Dad said, anything goes wrong, meet at the house.

419
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,800
他不在那里
He's not there.

420
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,720
他再也没有回来
He never came back.

421
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840

抱歉!
Sorry!

427
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,120
酒的度数挺高 那又怎样?
Pretty strong drinks. So what?

428
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,000
没那么高 他很厉害
Not that strong. He's good.

429
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,720
我一直在盯着他
I've been looking at him.

430
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,120
我想他在她们的酒里放了点东西
I think he's putting something in their drinks.

431
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,560
罗伯和安吉在这里的那个晚上他在吗?
Was he around the night Robbo and Ange were here?

432
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,920
我不能确定 但是...

433
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,080
嘿! 你在干什么?

434
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,560
嘿 你误会了 好吗?
Hey, OK, you got it wrong, OK?

435
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,040
- 你误会了 - 是吗?
- You got it wrong. - Yeah?

436
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,920
她们是我的朋友 我只是在试着帮助她们
They're my friends. I'm just trying to help them.

437
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,400
- 帮助她们? - 有点不对劲
- Help them out? - Something wrong.

438
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,828
你在周二晚上帮助别人了吗 
Help anyone else out Tuesday night? 

439
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:51,000
一个黑人男子和白人女孩?
A black guy and a white girl?

440
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,006
什么? 没有!  
What? No!  

441
00:28:52,007 --> 00:28:53,040
你帮助她早早地进了坟墓
You helped her into an early grave.

442
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,040
- 那个女孩死了 - 什么?

443
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,520
- 你带着刀子了吗? - 什么?

444
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,287

- Not gonna ask you again.- No!   

445
00:28:58,288 --> 00:28:59,400
好吗 那不是我干的
OK, it wasn't me.

446
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,920
你抓错人了 好吗?
You got the wrong guy, OK?

447
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,730
你掺了他们的酒 不是吗?  
You spiked their drinks, didn't you?  

448
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:03,280
是的 是的
Yeah, yeah.

449
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,280
你跟着他们出来了 他们也像这样吗?
You followed them out. Were they like that?

450
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,040
不不不 我没有到那一步 好吗?
No, no, no. OK, I didn't get that far, right?

451
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,720
他们和某人起了冲突 吵得很凶
They bump into someone and there was a big argument.

452
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,413
那是谁? 
Who was that?  

453
00:29:11,414 --> 00:29:12,800
我不知道 一个挺强硬的家伙
I don't know. Tough guy.

454
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,800
你知道 阴沉着脸
You know, not happy-looking face.

455
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,200
我不知道他是谁 我没逗留很久
I don't know who the hell he is, right, but I didn't stay too long.

456
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,880
然后我就回到酒吧了 仅此而已 好吗?
I just go back to my bar. That's all. Right?

457
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,720
现在你要进监狱了
Well, now you're going to jail.

458
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,720
阿姨!
Aunty!

459
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,720
不是 对不...
Ah, no. Excu...

460
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,600
抱歉 我没想吓你
Sorry, I didn't mean to alarm you,

461
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:50,120
但是在山姆那里没什么事情可做
but there's nothing much to do over at Sam's place,

462
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,560
所以我过来 看看有没有我能做的事
so I thought I'd come over and see if there's anything I can do.

463
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,060
山姆认识他


464
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,240
是他干的吗?
So is he the one?

465
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,680
貌似不是
Doesn't look like it.

466
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,040
阿姆兰说他以前做过这种事
Amran said he's done this kind of thing before.

467
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,240
但他没有谋杀的迹象
But he's got no form for murder.

468
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,440
不过至少高度酒
Well, at least the drink spiking

469
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,840
解释了我朋友为什么都不记得了
explains why your friend can't remember anything.

470
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,840
但也不能说明不是他杀的啊
Doesn't mean he didn't kill her.

471
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,480
他喝醉了 想做爱
He's drunk, wants sex.

472
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,960
她拒绝了
She say no.

473
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,280
有时候毒品会使人疯狂
Well, sometimes drugs makes you crazy.

474
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,760
嘿 嘘!
Hey, shh!

475
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,320
话说 和他们吵架的那个人你觉得是谁?
So, anyway, who do you think that tough guy was that they fought with?

476
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,200
也许就是闯进安吉公寓的那个人
Maybe it's the same guy who broke into Ange's apartment.

477
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,760
这之间一定有联系
It's gotta be connected.

478
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,880
那我猜我们应该在喧闹的唐人街逛一逛
I guess we just wander through busy Chinatown looking for a guy

479
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,280
找一下哪个人没了耳垂
with a missing earlobe, then.

480
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,360
如果有必要的话 只能这样了
Well, if that's what it takes, yeah.

481
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,240
她很出色
She was good.

482
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,480
她的文章 调查 意见
The writing, the research, the voice.

483
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,240
确实很出色
She was really good.

484
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,760
当然 她还年轻
I mean, she was still young.

485
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,840
暂时得不到什么奖
She wasn't going to win any prizes, yet.

486
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,160
但她绝对有这潜力
But she was certainly on her way.

487
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,480
不过她也很愚蠢
And she was also nuts.

488
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,700
一个人深夜去码头 去和毒贩交谈
Down at the docks late at night, by herself, talking to dealers.

489
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,920
她做得比我想象得还要深入
And she went much further than I realised.

490
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,880
调查居民 毒贩 各种动向
People. Deals, movements.

491
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,200
查到什么人了吗?
Any names?

492
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,280
是的 查到一个
Yeah, there is a name.

493
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,080
他是个毒贩
He's a dealer.

494
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,120
是他把大麻卖给她的
He's the bloke she bought the hash from.

495
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,600
是罗伯吗?
Is it Robbo?

496
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,680
不是
No.

497
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,800
他名叫莱昂内尔・章
His name's Lionel Cheong.

498
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,720
他在码头有一间小屋
He's got a shack down at the docks.

499
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,200
她把向他买毒品的过程描述得很清楚
She describes exactly how you buy drugs from him.

500
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,900
大叔派我来的


501
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,200
他说你的鱼今天很新鲜


502
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,900
大叔派我来的


503
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,900
他说你的鱼今天很新鲜


504
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,840
看看我们抓到谁了
Oh, look who we got here today.

505
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,680
他承认卖毒品给安吉
He's admitted to selling drugs to Ange

506
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,360
还试图把它偷回来 你还需要什么信息吗?
and trying to steal them back, so what else do you want?

507
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,160
他也许怕你打他就乱说一气
He probably said anything to stop you hitting him.

508
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,560
得了 我们碰都没碰他 他可能就是凶手
Come on, we hardly touched the guy. He could be the killer.

509
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,124
他这么说了吗?  
Did he say so?  

510
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:47,840
他不会承认的 不是吗?
He's not going to admit it, is he?

511
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,600
那个给他们下药的人说有看见他们和别人争吵
The guy who spiked their drinks says he saw them argue with someone.

512
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,080
这家伙脱不了干系
This guy's connected.

513
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,640
有个小问题
Slight problem.

514
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,000
那人两天前被警方锁定 整晚都被监视着
Two nights ago that man was in police lock-up. All night.

515
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,800
他不可能是凶手
He couldn't be the killer.

516
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
那把刀呢? 你们找到了吗?
So what about the knife? You found that yet?

517
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,280
是的 找到了
Yeah, we did.

518
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,200
在那个姑娘公寓后面的巷子里
In the back alley near the girl's apartment.

519
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,440
离我们抓到你朋友的地方很近
Close to where we picked up your friend.

520
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,400
依我看 是他在发现警察来抓他的时候
As I thought, he must have dumped it

521
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,120
把刀丢在那里的
when he saw the police coming for him.

522
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,600
你怎么知道是他的刀?
How do you know it's his knife?

523
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,080
刀柄上有一串数字
It has numbers on the handle.

524
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,080
- 4965... - 43
- 4965... - 43.

525
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,840
是的
Yeah.

526
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,920
那是罗伯的服役号
That's Robbo's service number.

527
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,840
- 搞定了 - 修好了吗?
- There you go. - Looking good?

528
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,600
是的 应该是好了
Yeah, that should do it.

529
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,200
来 试试
Here, try that one.

530
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,600
天哪 真合适 谢谢你
Oh, my God, it fits so perfectly. Thank you.

531
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,320
不客气
No worries.

532
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,280

谢谢
Thank you.

534
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,200
你在船上工作吗?
So you work on the ships?

535
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,568
你就是那样认识山姆的吗? 
So that's how you know Sam? 

536
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:57,960
在他做进出口工作时?
From his import-export work?

537
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,640
不 不是的 我...
Well, no, not exactly. I...

538
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,080
我很久以前就认识他了
I've known him for a long time.

539
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,280
警察先生
Inspector.

540
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,840
有何贵干?
What is your business here?

541
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,440
罗伯特・安德鲁・科利尔 我是来逮捕你的
Robert Andrew Collier, I'm placing you under arrest.

542
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,880
但他刚被保释出狱
But he's just been released on bail.

543
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,600
我们有新证据了
We have new evidence.

544
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,280
保释被驳回了
Bail's been revoked.

545
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,760
请站起来
Stand up, please.

546
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
嘿 嘿 站住!
Hey, hey, stop!

547
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,240
站住!
Stop!

548
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,960
你让我像是个傻瓜一样
You made me look like a dick.

549
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,440
走了那么多关系 托人帮忙 安排保释
Pulled all these strings, called in favours, organised bail.

550
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,968
可你的朋友却畏罪潜逃  
Now your mate's done a runner.  

551
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:57,880
不是他干的 先生
Sir, he didn't do it.

552
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,960
那他为什么要逃?
Well, why did he run, hmm?

553
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,560
正如我们所说 现在你的另一朋友又要在公爵
Now your other mate's down at the Duke as we speak

554
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,800
炮制下一个大新闻
banging out his next big story.

555
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,960
我都不敢去想明天的头条会是什么
I don't even want to guess what the headline is,

556
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,720
但我猜'土著居民'和'畏罪潜逃'
but I would suspect that 'Aborigine' and 'walkabout'

557
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,080
会是关键词
will feature fairly largely.

558
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,480
听着 如果你坚信他是清白的
Look, if you are convinced this man is innocent,

559
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,720
那就找些证据出来
then find some bloody evidence.

560
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,280
我可以告诉你的是
And I can tell you this.

561
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,198
如果是他杀害了那个澳大利亚女孩 
If he's murdered an Australian girl, 

562
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:32,440
那战争英雄的头衔也救不了他
being a war hero will not help him.

563
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,960
等等 你去哪?
Wait. Where are you going?

564
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:51,060
爸爸说 如果情况有变 就在家里碰头
Dad said, if anything goes wrong, meet at the house.

565
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,240
你不能待在这
You can't stay here.

566
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,600
这里没有吃的
There's no food.

567
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,440
我能找到吃的
I can get food.

568
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,240
这人是谁?
Who this man?

569
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,160
你又是谁?
Who the hell are you?

570
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,040
他是翁叔叔 我一直问他要吃的
This is Uncle Weng. I've been getting food off him.

571
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,400
从战俘监狱里来的?
From the camp?

572
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,520
你从战俘监狱溜到城市里来的?
You snuck into the city from the prison camp?

573
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,520
总得有人这么做
Someone had to.

574
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,240
我要回店里去了
I've got to get back to the shop.

575
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,720
你一个人没问题吗?
You sure you're OK?

576
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,160
你这样过多久了?
How long you been doing this?

577
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,440
自从妈妈被杀后就一直这样过了
Since Mum got murdered.

578
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,000
看来你还真不愧是个侦探 对吧?
So you really are some sort of detective, eh?

579
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,520
我想如果我是个好侦探 我就应该先来这里
I suppose if I were any good, I would have come here first.

580
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,480
知道吗 当你第一次带我来这时
You know, when you first brought me here,

581
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,040
我以为你在战争前
I thought that you must have been

582
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,960
一定是个被宠坏的小家伙
one hell of a spoilt brat before the war.

583
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,320
所以你才无法面对
Thought that's why you couldn't face the fact

584
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,560
爸爸回不了家这一事实
that your dad wasn't coming home.

585
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,720
你总是有你自己的行事方式
I mean, you always had your own way.

586
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,680
是的
Yeah.

587
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,360
现在我觉得真相很难去面对...
Now I'm thinking truth can be a hard thing to face...

588
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,888
...不管你是四五年时的小伙
...whether you're a young lad in '45 

589
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:55,440
还是六四年时的老兵
or an old soldier in '64.

590
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,760
那你准备怎么办? 回到船上吗?
So what do you wanna do? Get back on the boat?

591
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,600
船今晚就开
Ship sails tonight.

592
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,120
船长是我的朋友
The captain's a mate.

593
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,240
他能帮我移民出去
He can get me through immigration.

594
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,160
那你就再也回不来了
You could never come back.

595
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,520
是的
The truth.

596
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,000
你有计划?
You got a plan?

597
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,160
是的
Yeah.

598
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,840
那就赶快开始吧
Then you'd better get cracking.

599
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,000
你到这来里来过 记得吗?
So you came here. You remember that?

600
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,200
是的 虽然不是很清楚
Yeah, it's not clear as day.

601
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,400
但回忆起来不是问题
But that's not the bit I'm having problems with.

602
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,880
你们做了些什么?
And what were you doing?

603
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,720
安吉和我在外面买了些东西吃
Well, Ange and I got something to eat outside,

604
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,600
我喂她吃鸡爪
and I fed her a chook's foot.

605
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,480
然后进来喝酒除除味道
And we came in here to wash the taste out.

606
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,880
你记得和谁说过话吗?
Do you remember talking to someone?

607
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,640
年轻的马来人?
Young Malay bloke?

608
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,840
没有
No.

609
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,680
我认为他在你们酒里下了药
I think he spiked your drink.

610
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,240
好吧 这之后呢?
Alright, what happened after that?

611
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,080
安吉觉得头有点晕
Well, Ange was feeling a little dizzy.

612
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,840
我们就出去透透气
We went out to get some fresh air.

613
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,080
- 你们这就出去了? - 是的
- So you left? - Yeah.

614
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,720
好的 那你们走的哪条路?
OK, so which way did you go?

615
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,520
从这走的
Ah, through this way.

616
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:17,160
有只 猴子在跳舞
There was, er, a monkey dancing in the street.

617
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,720
那边
That way.

618
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,040
她说这是近路
She said it was a short cut.

619
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,480
有几个人在这里赌博
There was a bunch of guys gambling through here.

620
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,280
这扇门
This door.

621
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,680
那个炒面男
The chow mein guy.

622
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,800
什么?
The what?

623
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,520
炒面男 他在这里
The chow mein guy, he was there.

624
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,600
- 有打斗吗? - 不 不 没那回事
- Was it a fight? - Oh, no, no, nothing like that.

625
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,160
我们继续走
We just kept on walking.

626
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,800
就这样了
And that's it.

627
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,640
我能记起的下一件事 就是我在她身边醒来
Next thing I know, I woke up next to her.

628
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,040
一定还有其他的情况
There's got to be something else.

629
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,840
安吉家在拐角处
Ange's place is around the corner.

630
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
肯定有什么事在这里发生
Whatever it was had to have happened here.

631
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,440
就在这里
Right here.

632
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,440
听着 这是个好主意
Look, it was a good idea.

633
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,680
- 好方法 - 继续想 罗伯 拜托了
- A good try. - Keep thinking, Robbo. Come on.

634
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,000
你在这里 安吉在这里
You were here, Ange was here.

635
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,840
也许我不想查出真相
Maybe I don't want to find out.

636
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,160
也许是我干的
Maybe I did it.

637
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,600
也许除了这点什么也发现不了
Maybe there's nothing to find out except that.

638
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,680
也许是你干的
Maybe you did.

639
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,960
你不想确定一下吗?
Don't you want to know for sure?

640
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,120
怎么了?
What is it?

641
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,520
想起一些东西
Something.

642
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,040
她休息了一下
She rested.

643
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,480
安吉
Ange.

644
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,840
安吉在这里休息
Ange rested here.

645
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,160
当时我在这里
And I was here.

646
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,160
炒面男
The chow mein guy.

647
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,200
你的包!
Your bag!

648
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,000
别管它了
Don't worry about it.

649
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,040
你还好吗?
You OK?

650
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:32,080
我们回... 家吧
Let's get... home.

651
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,720
我没想到有那么严重
I didn't realise it was that serious.

652
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,320
你不可能知道的
Well, you couldn't have known.

653
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,520
我本可以做点什么的
Well, I could have done something.

654
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,920
- 我本可以求助的 - 不过你被下药了
- I could have called for help. - But you were drugged.

655
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,120
你没杀他 罗伯 是这个人干的
You didn't kill her, Robbo. This other guy did.

656
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,080
就因为我们撞到了他?
Because we bumped him?

657
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,160
只是运气不好罢了
It was just bad luck.

658
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,120
错误的时间错误的地点
Wrong place at the wrong time.

659
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,560
你记得他的相貌吗?
You remember his face?

660
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,320
是的 我记得
Yeah, I remember his face.

661
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,800
下午好 哈里森 进展得怎么样了?
Good afternoon, Harrison. How did you get on?

662
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,400
我拿到你想要的东西了
I got what you wanted.

663
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,800
太棒了
Excellent.

664
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,080
我会继续做你交给我的事
And I'm going to keep on doing as you ask.

665
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,749
不过我知道你的本质... 
But I see you for what you are... 

666
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,680
一个虚伪卑鄙的英国佬
a slimy limey turd.

667
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,612
我真心希望你趁太阳还没下山 
I really hope that you enjoy the sunshine 

668
00:44:52,613 --> 00:44:53,800
好好欣赏阳光
while it lasts,

669
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,480
因为总有一天 农奴会翻身做主人的
because one day the boot's going to be on the other foot.

670
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,160
好像是那个人
That looks like him.

671
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,120
你记得我吗?
You remember me?

672
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,480
整件事不过是一个很遗憾的故事
The whole thing's just a sorry story.

673
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,400
他生气了 赶上他们 想抢走安吉的包
I mean, he got angry, went after 'em, tried to snatch Ange's bag.

674
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,720
她没意识到她伤得多严重
She didn't realise how badly she'd been hurt.

675
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,800
- 这故事不错 - 搜搜他的住所
- Good story. - Search his apartment.

676
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,480
说不定能找到她的包
Maybe you'll find her bag.

677
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,400
你把刀扫描了吗?
You pull any prints off the knife?

678
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,000
我肯定上面全是方的指纹
I bet Fong's are all over it.

679
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,680
是他干的 阿姆兰
He's the one, Amran.

680
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,320
不是罗伯
Not Robbo.

681
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,120
- 你朋友确定是那个人? - 对
- Your friend's sure it was that guy? - Oh, yeah.

682
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,040
- 我会调查清楚的 - 好的
- I'll look into it. - OK.

683
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,840
真为你朋友高兴
Very pleased for your mate.

684
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,800
你可以自己告诉他啊
Well, you could tell him yourself.

685
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,030
你也知道 我有好多事要干 
Oh, well, you know, so much to do. 

686
00:46:37,031 --> 00:46:38,920
邮件 外交函件啊
Mail, diplomatic correspondence.

687
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,200
另外 我得给这个女孩的父母写一份官方报告
Plus, I need to write an official report for the girl's parents.

688
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,080
不过拜托你 把我的问候带给他
But please, give the man my best.

689
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,000
罗伯特・科利尔
Robert Collier.

690
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,680
对 没错 是科利尔
Yes, Collier. Exactly.

691
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,160
她们来了
Ah. Here they are.

692
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,000
现在 她们要过来喝点开胃酒了
Now, they will be down here for an aperitif shortly.

693
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,280
你想留下来吗?
Would you care to stay?

694
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,120
不行 我要去见一个人
Oh, I can't. I'm meeting someone.

695
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,160
真聪明啊
Wise man.

696
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,160
接下来的事 我们称之为外交事件
Now, there's what you call a diplomatic incident.

697
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,360
要是你想跟小白脸鬼混
If you're going to go wild with the pool boy,

698
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,160
老天 可千万别告诉你丈夫
for God's sake, don't tell the husband.

699
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,680
不论如何 再次谢谢你 卡拉汉
Anyhow, thanks again, Callaghan.

700
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,400
安吉 她是个好女孩
She was a good girl, Ange.

701
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,680
很聪明
Bright.

702
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,240
她面前有大好的前程
She had the whole world in front of her.

703
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,440
我不敢相信她已经死了
I can't believe she's dead.

704
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,720
就因为 有个家伙 这...
All because what, some bloke, what...

705
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,200
这叫什么 命该如此还是只是运气不好?
What's that, fate or just dumb luck?

706
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,025
不管是什么 
Whatever it is, 

707
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:24,080
它让你在四五年的时候为我停下来了
it made you stop for me in '45.

708
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,080
一路顺风 大哥
Sail well, brother.

709
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,800
谢谢 兄弟
Thanks, mate.

710
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,880
你的朋友正式清白了
Your friend's officially in the clear.

711
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,560
李库方被控告了
Lee Kum Fong's been charged.

712
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,280
我们在他的住所找到了女孩的包
We found the girl's handbag at his place.

713
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,440
下药的人应该能找到他
The drink spiker was able to ID him.

714
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,400
关于指纹你也说对了
And you were right about those prints.

715
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,880
你听上去很惊讶
You sound surprised.

716
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,680
我以为你想让方进监狱
Well, I thought you might have your own reasons

717
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,160
可能有你自己的原因
for wanting Fong in jail.

718
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,240
- 为什么? - 杀害温斯顿的凶手
- Why? - Winston's murder.

719
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,200
李库方是其中一个嫌疑人
Lee Kum Fong was one of the suspects.

720
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,280
那晚有人看见他在现场 这是他的风格
He was seen in the area that night. It's his style.

721
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,720
杯子里藏了把刀
Mugging with a knife.

722
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,920
我不确定他是唯一的嫌疑人
I wasn't too sure and he wasn't the only suspect.

723
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,440
不过我已经盯上他了
But I had my eye on him.

724
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,480
你认为李库方杀了温斯顿・郑?
You think Lee Kum Fong killed Winston Cheng?

725
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,960
我觉得有这个可能
I think it's possible.

726
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,680
我们查了温斯顿被杀时正在调查的所有案件
We've been going back through all the cases Winston was working on

727
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,040
没提到方啊
when he was killed, and there was no mention of Fong.

728
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,360
第一次 我们有了嫌疑人
Well, for the first time, we've got a suspect.

729
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,320
方可能是唯一一个
Fong could be the only person who knows

730
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,800
知道当晚温斯顿情况的人
what happened to Winston that night.

731
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,440
我们得从他开始
We've got to start with him.

732
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,360
明天一早我就去找他谈
I'll talk to him first thing tomorrow.

733
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,960
好的
Yeah, alright.

734
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,760
山姆?
Oh, Sam?

735
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,640
你朋友 辛普森夫人
Um, your friend, Mrs Simpson.

736
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,560
我听说她要离开新加坡了
I've heard she's leaving Singapore.

737
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,280
你知道这事儿吗?
Do you know that?

738
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,240
明天一早
First thing tomorrow morning.

739
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,760
好了 抱歉耽误了这么久
Here you go. Sorry that took so long.

740
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,520
失陪一下
Excuse me.

741
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,760
嘿
Hey.

742
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,360
山姆?
Sam?

743
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,920
她在这吗?
Is she here?

744
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,440
要是我告诉你她在呢?
And what if I told you that she was?

745
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,080
山姆
Oh, Sam.

746
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,480
你能给她带来什么呢?
I mean, what can you offer her?

747
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,560
什么 唐人街的一个房间?
What is it, a room in Chinatown?

748
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,440
她失去了她的婚姻 她的家庭 她的朋友
She'd lose her marriage, her family, her friends.

749
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,520
她没有工作
She'd have no job.

750
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,440
我是说 她能怎么做呢?
I mean, what would she do?

751
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,720
你知道 要是你真的爱她...
You know, if you really love her...

752
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,880
...你也许应该想想怎么做对她最好
...you might consider just doing what's best for her.

753
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,400
我不会告诉她你来过
I won't tell her that you were here.

754
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,480
重要的不是你这么做了
It's not that you did it.

755
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,680
而是他拿什么威胁你让你这么做的
It's whatever he's got on you that made you do it.

756
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,160
我在建议他们把你安排到别的地方
I'm recommending they post you somewhere else.

757
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,760
对不起我对你撒谎了
I'm sorry that I lied to you.

758
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,440
如果我问你一个问题 是想得到诚实的答案
If I ask you a question, I expect an honest answer.

759
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,640
日安 弗兰克
G'day, Frank.

760
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,720
周五晚上 我们会永远离开新加坡
On Friday night, we're leaving Singapore for good.

761
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,840
我们会坐船去欧洲并且不会再回来
We're going to Europe by ship and we're not coming back.

762
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,120
齐基特的办公室 齐基特和温斯顿认识对方
Chee Kit's office. Chee Kit and Winston knew each other.

763
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,800
我相信我哥哥跟一些危险人物有联系
I believe my brother was involved with some dangerous people.

764
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,280
一切还好吗 林先生?
Everything alright, Mr Lim?

765
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,960
这是我找出杀害我丈夫的凶手的机会
This is my chance to find out who killed my husband.
