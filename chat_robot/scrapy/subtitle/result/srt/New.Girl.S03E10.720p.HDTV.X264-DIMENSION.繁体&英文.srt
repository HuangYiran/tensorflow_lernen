1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,510
尼克  我得跟你談談
Nick! We need to talk.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,800
溫斯頓留下  沒什么好談的了
Winston stays. End of discussion.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,650
不是
No, dude.

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,440
我收到了你的感恩節邀請
I got your Thanksgiving invitation.

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,090
感恩節盛會

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,910
-這是你做的嗎  -當然不是
- Did you make this? - Absolutely not.

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,950
他在宣布感恩節的到來
He's announcing Thanksgiving!

8
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,660
他拿著小號  宣布盛會召開
With his little trumpet, he's announcing the feast!

9
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,030
太好玩了
It's so funny...

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,540
我們給他起名叫羅格吧
We should name that little guy Roger.

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,620
你那蛋蛋掉出來的時候
When your testicles fell off,

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,990
是帶了多少雌性激素啊
did you form lady parts,

13
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,120
還是你太陰虛了
or is it kind of like a Gonzo nose down there?

14
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,980
-這是個好問題  -是吧
- It's really interesting. - Yeah.

15
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,620
但是吧
You see, the thing is,

16
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,450
-我的蛋蛋其實還沒下來呢  -是哦
- my testicles haven't fallen off... -Right.

17
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,750
還早著呢
...it's just the morning.

18
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,830
還有外面很冷的時候
And my testicles do this really unique thing

19
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,790
我的蛋蛋會很有特點地蜷縮
of burrowing... when it's cold out.

20
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,570
你就是在氣我吧
You're burning me.

21
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,880
-我得跟你說句實話  -洗耳恭聽
- I gotta be real with you. - Please.

22
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,940
我知道男人一般
I know how a guy can get, like,

23
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,570
在感情中總會迷失
lost in a relationship.

24
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,320
我感同身受
I've been there, dude. You're snuggling,

25
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,890
你就在那纏綿啊  纏綿啊  纏綿啊
you're snuggling, you're snuggling,

26
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,000
突然之間你就變了
and then, bam!

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,240
之后你就會
Next thing you know, you're wearing

28
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,280
開始穿迷你裙  抹胸裝
a jean skirt and a tube top with no panties on,

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,270
因為你們會說好
because you guys said you were gonna

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,410
在萬圣節打扮成對方的模樣
dress up like each other for Halloween.

31
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,820
但她卻不會穿成你的樣子
But she doesn't dress up like you.

32
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,170
但你們還是會去萬圣節派對
But you still go to the party.

33
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,130
那我實在是太遺憾了
I could not be more sorry for you,

34
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,610
因為我們不是這樣的
but that's not my story.

35
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,500
那你站起來
Stand up.

36
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,980
-站起來  -對
- Stand up?  - Yeah.

37
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,340
好吧
Okay.

38
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,790
你穿的是杰茜卡的睡褲嗎
Are those Jessica's pajama bottoms?

39
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,610
這是運動服
It's, uh... football player pants for, uh,

40
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,770
關注乳腺癌活動的運動服
br-breast cancer awareness.

41
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,180
我喜歡它對我小巨蛋的包裹感
I like the way that they hug my gronk.

42
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,260
杰茜駕到  第三季第十集

43
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,630
感恩節去野營么
Camping on Thanksgiving?

44
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,850
可能是個瘋狂的尼克式想法  但我還挺喜歡的
It might be a crazy Nick idea, but I kind of like it.

45
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,130
我還以為你討厭野營和大自然呢
I thought you hated camping and nature.

46
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,960
你不是說你害怕蒼蠅
You said you were afraid a fly was gonna

47
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,030
會飛進你的腦袋洞悉你的想法嗎
fly in your head and learn all your thoughts.

48
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,910
我是個爺們  爺們就要有野性
I am a man, and men belong in wilderness.

49
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,690
這對我很重要
It really means a lot to me.

50
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,440
我在乎的只有
The only thing I care about

51
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,070
我們能待在一會兒
is that we're all together.

52
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,740
我們能坐在一起
And that we can all sit down together

53
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,750
吃頓晚餐就挺好了
and have a nice dinner.

54
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,330
我完全同意
I 100% agree.

55
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,340
我覺得大家會喜歡這個主意的
I think everybody's gonna love this idea.

56
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,100
我也覺得
Me, too.

57
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,920
-野營  瘋了吧  -我們又不是動物
- Camping? What the hell? - Like we're animals?

58
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,360
聽他說嘛
Come on. Hear him out.

59
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,170
想想吧
Let's face it.

60
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,580
我們在家度過的感恩節可都不怎么樣
Our indoor Thanksgivings haven't been so great.

61
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,440
-火雞  -有死人
- Turkey! - Dead body!

62
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,790
我覺得我喜歡上你媽了
I think I'm into your mother.

63
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,200
這次不可能更糟了
So this can't be worse.

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,620
謝謝你杰茜卡  我接著說
Thank you, Jessica, I got it from here.

65
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,900
-不客氣  -今年感恩節
- All right. - This Thanksgiving,

66
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,140
我要發揚我們祖先的傳統
I want to honor the traditions of our forefathers.

67
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,840
當年清教徒和土著人相處融洽
The mighty Pilgrims and Native Americans

68
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,340
才得以共同生存
who came together in order to survive.

69
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,340
是啊
Sure, yeah.

70
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,060
在合作的歷史上展開了新的篇章
The first chapter in a proud history of cooperation.

71
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,290
野營將是對我們的男子氣概
It'll be the ultimate test of manhood

72
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,890
和生存能力的終極考驗
and our survival skills.

73
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,260
-是嗎  -怎么考驗男子氣概
- It will? - How's this for a test of our manhood?

74
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,210
我們呆在家
We stay at home,

75
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,010
喝酒  看球
we drink beer, we watch football.

76
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,980
-那才是男人  -我喜歡
- Manhood. - I like that idea.

77
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,940
溫斯頓  我在說純爺們兒該做的事
Winston, I'm talking about real men.

78
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,750
-我說的也是啊  -能夠自我打拼的純爺們兒
- Me, too. - Men who fend for themselves.

79
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,140
你是我認識的最懶的人了
You're the laziest man I know.

80
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,660
杰茜  你說實話
Okay, Jess, be honest with me.

81
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,260
你們滾床單的時候他在上面過嗎
Has he ever been on top?

82
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,430
純爺們兒都在下面
Real men are on the bottom.

83
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,610
才不是
No, they're not.

84
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,750
-你在下面吧  -大家聽我說
- You're on the bottom... - Guys, guys.

85
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,370
這可是感恩節
It's Thanksgiving.

86
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,710
我們得在一起過
We need to be together.

87
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,730
誰想去野營
Who's in?

88
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,230
舉手啊  親們
Come on, guys!

89
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,540
-好吧  我去  -什么

90
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,730
-施密特  太棒了  -太棒了
- Yeah, Schmidt! - Yes!

91
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,930
以前我爸媽一直都在鬧離婚
Look, my parents were super divorced

92
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,690
根本就沒帶我去野營過
and they never took me camping,

93
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,990
但我覺得我應該還挺擅長這個的
but I always thought that I'd be incredible at it.

94
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,960
快去準備吧
Let's get ready.

95
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,460
施密特  你頭上戴的這是啥啊
What the hell is on your head, Schmidt?

96
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,930
簡直就是山寨維戈·莫特森
It's an exact replica of the hat

97
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,850
在《殺魔騎兵》里戴的帽子
Viggo Mortensen wore in Hidalgo.

98
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,100
我就知道你會喜歡

104
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,530
我不知道她會來
I didn't know she was gonna be here.

105
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,260
真高興你來了

108
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,630
還有什么比和我的前男友
I mean, what could be better

109
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,930
以及剛和我約過會的前男友的朋友

110
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,270
一起去森林里野營更好的事呢

你剛和誰約會了
With whom you just made out.

112
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,730
別說了  你知道我不喜歡這樣
Don't. You know I hate that.

113
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,030
-別問了  -語法是很重要的
- Don't. - Grammar's important.

114
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,050
說真的  別問了
Seriously, don't.

115
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,010
如果你們相處不來  我會來救你的

關于森林需要知道的一切

134
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,960
現在  我是個露營高手了

138
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,390
關于森林什么的我一無所知
I don't know anything about the wood.

139
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,750
-我什么都知道  -我簡直是云里霧里
- I know everything. - I'm lost.

140
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,790
那是什么  樹嗎
What is that, a tree?

141
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,320
如果把這些樹換成高樓大廈
If these trees were skyscrapers,

142
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,180
-你就舒服多了吧  -是啊
- you'd feel very comfortable. - Yeah.

143
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,880
那就像在家里一樣舒服  不幸的是
I'd be right at home. Unfortunately,

144
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,730
它們就是樹
they're actual trees.

145
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,640
-你最棒了  -我喜歡你的帽子
- You're the best. - I love the hat!

146
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,730
抱歉  那是太陽能手機充電器嗎
I'm sorry, is that a solar cell phone charger?

147
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,010
是啊  沒有它的話我撐不過兩天
Yeah, I can't go more than two days without it.

148
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,240
等等  你也...討厭野營嗎
Okay, hold on. Do you... do you hate camping, too?

149
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,620
你在開玩笑嗎  我恨死野營了
Are you kidding me? I absolutely hate camping.

150
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,380
那我們還待在這里干嘛
Then why are we here?

151
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,890
因為我沒有話語權  我從來沒有過
Because I didn't get a say. I never get a say.

152
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,280
不管我想做什么  他們鳥都不鳥我
Whenever I want to do something, they don't give a hoot.

153
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,520
猜猜看誰拿到了去陶瓷研討會的入場券
Guess who just got free passes to a pottery seminar.

154
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,190
-快出去吧  -溫斯頓
- Get out of here. - Winston!

155
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,100
我們本來可以做最棒的馬克杯的
We could've made the craziest mugs, man.

156
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,320
-尼克  -在
- Hey, Nick? - Yeah.

157
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,440
這里只有啤酒
There's just beer in here.

158
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,970
這應該能夠我們喝上幾個小時的
That should last us for the first few hours, actually.

159
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,270
食物在哪兒
Where's the food?

160
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,740
那些我做的派在哪兒
Where... where are all the pies I made?

161
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,240
別擔心  杰茜
Look, don't worry, Jess.

162
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,070
因為食物就在...就在這里
'Cause the food is... right here.

163
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,570
抱歉  我不太懂那個手勢是什么意思
I'm... sorry. I don't understand that gesture.

164
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,330
我們要出去打獵覓食
We're gonna be hunting and foraging for our dinner,

165
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,760
就像印第安人和清教徒那樣
just like the Indians and the Pilgrims.

166
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,750
但你帶了啤酒來
But you brought beer.

167
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,220
你沒法覓到啤酒的  這是必需品
You can't forage for beer. And that's a necessity.

168
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,740
這就是感恩節晚餐嗎
So this is Thanksgiving meal?

169
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,470
96罐熱啤酒
96 warm beers?

170
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,480
我們可以這樣
We can do this.

171
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,270
伙計們  我們變得很軟弱
Guys, we've gotten soft!

172
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,790
就因為抗生素和止疼膏
With our antibiotics and our sports creams.

173
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,700
你們覺得喬治·華盛頓會養寵物貓嗎
Do you think George Washington had a pet cat?

174
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,920
-是啊  -不  他不會
- Yeah. - No. He didn't.

175
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,590
-他捕獵貓  -你說啥
- He hunted them. - What?

176
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,570
他從它們身上榨取了奶和黃油
And he made milk and butter out of their spoils.

177
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,410
這太可怕了
That's terrible.

178
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,730
你是說喬治·華盛頓給他的貓擠奶嗎
So you're saying George Washington milked his cat?

179
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,550
-聽起來太不正常了  -完全沒有
- Nothing is sounding accurate right now. - Not at all.

180
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,350
你從哪兒讀到這個的
Where'd you read this?

181
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,780
我沒說這很簡單
I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

182
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,950
這很困難
It's gonna be hard.

183
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,120
但我們一定能完成的
But we will emerge out of this

184
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,560
我們會成為更好的朋友  成為一個部落
better friends and a tribe.

185
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,800
我參加
I'm on board.

186
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,450
返璞歸真嘛
Going old-school.

187
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,280
上啊  殺啊  捕獵啊  上啊
Men! Killing! Hunting! Men!

188
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,830
上啊  上啊  上啊  上啊
Men! Men! Men! Men!

189
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,110
我的牛仔帽  我的牛仔...
Oh, my cowman's... my cowman...

190
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,550
我的牛仔帽  我的牛仔帽
my cowman's hat, my cowman's hat.

191
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:28,890
伙計們  聽我說
Guys, look,

192
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,940
我和這里的所有人一樣有血性
I'm as much a man as anybody here,

193
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,930
但這個計劃簡直是太挫了
but this plan is straight-up dookie.

194
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,660
我需要糖果  我需要游行
I need my sweets and I need my parade.

195
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,420
你知道嗎  我也不參加了
Yeah, you know what? I'm out, too.

196
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,200
同志們  同志們  聽我說
Guys, guys, guys. Look.

197
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,780
我們團圓了
We're together.

198
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,630
我們是一家人
We're a family.

199
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,770
這是感恩節啊
It's Thanksgiving.

200
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,660
我保證尼克是計劃好了的  對吧
And I'm sure Nick has a plan. Right?

201
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,810
-我當然有計劃了  -太好了
- Oh, yeah. I've got a plan. - Great.

202
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,430
-你有計劃  -那個人有計劃
- You got a plan? - The man's got a plan.

203
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,330
這些野外指南詳細的介紹了
These wilderness guides right here detail what plants

204
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,360
什么植物能吃  什么陷阱能造
are safe for eating and what traps we can build.

205
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,090
不幸的是  我沒錢了
Unfortunately, I ran out of money,

206
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,600
所以我沒法打印
so I couldn't print out the chapters

207
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,880
開膛破肚和剝皮的內容  不過
on gutting and skinning, but...

208
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,080
等我們到了那一步再說吧
we'll worry about that when we get there.

209
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,360
按清教徒的規矩
Pilgrim rules.

210
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,420
男人打獵
Men, hunters!

211
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,940
女人搜集食材
Women, foragers.

212
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,830
我才不打獵  要打我也只打
I'm not hunting. The only hunt I want

213
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,070
邦妮或者海倫
is Bonnie or Helen.

214
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,070
Bonnie Hunt和Helen Hunt是兩個女明星
雖然都姓Hunt  但沒有親戚關系

215
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,170
你懂的  教練
You know what I'm talking about, Coach.

216
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,090
不懂
What?

217
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,360
尼克
Nick.

218
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,520
太完美了  回歸自然的原始人
This is perfect. Primal man in nature.

219
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,310
圍捕獵物  現在誰才像個娘們  教練
Stalking prey. Who's basically the lady now, Coach?

220
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,150
這二十分鐘我都見到這棵樹六次了
I've seen that tree six times in the past 20 minutes.

221
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,390
我們肯定在兜圈子
We're definitely moving in a small circle.

222
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,660
那我就這樣  我往這邊開出一條小路
Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna clear a path this way.

223
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,810
我們一路向北
We will travel northbound, I believe.

224
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,940
那不是北邊  是南邊
That's not north, that's south.

225
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,190
南邊嗎  那我們就一路向南
That is south? Then let's travel southbound.

226
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,820
我來開路  要是里面有什么
I'm gonna clear a path. If something's in there

227
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,810
而你被它傷到的話  我會幫你快速了斷的
and you get injured, I promise you I will kill you fast.

228
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,030
糞便  糞便
Scat! Scat.

229
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,950
-這附近有只動物  -施密特  那是顆葡萄干
- There's an animal nearby. - Hey, Schmidt, that's a raisin, man.

230
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,950
這不是葡萄干  這就是動物糞便
That's not a raisin. This is scat.

231
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,580
好吧
Okay.

232
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,060
這肯定是糞便
That's poop for sure.

233
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,560
我是對的  打臉哦  尼克
I was right. In your face, Nick.

234
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,950
-打臉哦  尼克  -所以呢
- In your face, Nick. - How so?

235
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,090
不知道  他把  把一顆糞便吃了
I don't know, he put a... put a turd in his mouth.

236
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,230
-所以那就打我臉了  真是  -沒錯
- And that's in my face? So that's... - Yeah.

237
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,520
我覺得我們還沒到吃屎的地步  施密特
I don't think we should start eating poo yet, Schmidt.

238
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,100
盡管等著吧
Let's wait on that.

239
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,430
你要不要吃點土清清口
You want to chase that with some dirt?

240
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,860
有人有口香糖嗎
Does anyone have any gum?

241
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,600
沒有
No.

242
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,140
我一開始就不想這樣的
Not that I wanted any in the first place.

243
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,680
那洞也太大了  尼克
That's a mighty big hole there, Nick.

244
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,830
你想逮個大冰箱么
You trying to catch a refrigerator?

245
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,880
這是個熊洞
It's a bear hole.

246
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,110
熊掉進去  然后其他東西掉進去
Bear falls in, other stuff falls in.

247
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,210
我們就拿熊不要的
We take what the bear doesn't want.

248
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,450
-有道理  -經典的人熊團隊
- Makes sense. - Classic human/bear team-up.

249
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,960
我是芝加哥人  我只能做到這樣了
I'm from Chicago. It's the best I can do.

250
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,300
是啊  熊都喜歡跟你分享食物
Yeah, bears love to share.

251
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,310
等那只熊掉進洞里的時候
What are you planning on doing with

252
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,510
你打算怎么做
that bear when he falls into the hole?

253
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,220
伙計  我已經盡力了
Dude, I'm trying the best that I can!

254
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,340
我們沒有吃的
We have no food.

255
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,270
我來告訴你吧  尼克
Let me explain something to you, Nick.

256
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,410
在做陷阱的時候
When you're building a trap,

257
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,870
得為你的獵物一一量身定制
you want to customize it to your prey.

258
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,300
所以呢  如果我想抓
So, I don't know, if I was

259
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,920
比如說  松鼠的話
trying to catch, say a squirrel,

260
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,880
我會像松鼠一樣思考
I'd want to think like a squirrel.

261
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,890
容我用我造的這個陷阱來做演示
Allow me to demonstrate with this trap that I built.

262
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,310
你怎么能像松鼠一樣思考呢
How do you get into the mindset of a squirrel?

263
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,450
我是只松鼠  對吧
I'm a squirrel... right?

264
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,980
-學得真像  -看這里
- You do that really well. - Look at this!

265
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,270
這兒有些堅果
Oh, there's some nuts here.

266
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,350
看這些可愛的小堅果
Look at all these little nuts.

267
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,820
你最好別那么做
You might not want to do that.

268
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,960
我要是想學紡紗的話
If I needed your advice on how to lead a spinning class,

269
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,130
我會請教你的  但這可是我的專業領域
I'd ask you, but this is my territory.

270
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,670
-我的肩胛骨  -兄弟  你沒事吧
- My scapula! - Dude, are you all right?

271
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,900
快弄開
Aah! Aah, get it off! Aah!

272
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,740
快
Get it!

273
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,960
起來  深呼吸
Get up. Keep breathing, man.

274
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,920
我不是故意要笑的
I don't mean to be laughing,

275
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,940
-你還好嗎  -我得給你綁個繃帶
- but are you okay? - I’m gonna make you a sling.

276
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,660
你要干嘛
You're gonna make me a what?

277
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,520
-你根本不會  -繃帶
- You don't know how to do that. - A sling.

278
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,760
我當然會綁
Of course I do.

279
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,150
你在干嘛
What...?What are you doing?

280
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,440
我當年可是鷹級童子軍[最高級童子軍]
I was an Eagle Scout.

281
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,400
你在說什么呢  你是鷹級童子軍
What are you talking about, you were an Eagle Scout?

282
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,960
-你看吧  -確實還不錯
- Look. - That's actually really good.

283
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,040
很抱歉  伙計  你想做野營第一人
I'm sorry, dude. You wanted to be the best at camping.

284
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,360
你又對你那頂帽子那么興奮
You were so excited about your hat.

285
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,010
我并不想干預
I didn't want to get in the way of that.

286
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,760
再加上整個關于希希的事
Plus with the whole Cece thing or whatever.

287
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,350
你說什么呢
What are you talking about?

288
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,240
我的第一是你讓出來的嗎
You're gonna let me be the best camper.

289
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,320
-我就是野營第一人  -是啊
- I am the best camper! - Yeah.

290
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,060
我覺得這是菊苣
I think this is chicory.

291
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,750
書上說它的根可以吃
It says you can eat the root.

292
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,430
這也可能是茉莉
Or it's jasmine.

293
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,450
吃了會死的
Which will kill you.

294
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,180
你們怎么看
Hmm. What do you guys think?

295
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,480
-肯定沒事的  -盡管吃吧
- I’m sure it's fine. - Yeah, just eat it.

296
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,330
樹莓
Hey, raspberries!

297
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,380
這兒
There... Ow!

298
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,690
這兒有很多樹莓
There are a lot of brambles in here.

299
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,160
離這兒不遠有家鄉村小店
There's a country store not far from here.

300
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,340
三星半  評論說
Three and a half stars. The reviews say,

301
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,010
"湊活能吃不過很臟"
"It's functional and dusty."

302
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,280
我覺得還行
Sounds good to me.

303
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,420
棒極了  誰來幫幫我
This is so fun. Who wants to help?

304
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,370
這計劃顯然是最糟糕的
This plan is officially the worst.

305
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,940
我們要餓死了
We are starving.

306
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,000
盡管承認吧  你也不想這么做
Just admit, you don't want to do this, either.

307
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,780
聽好了
Okay, listen up.

308
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,210
只能買森林里能找到的東西  好嗎
Only stuff we can find in the forest, right?

309
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,210
看那魚
Look at that fish.

310
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,490
棒極了
It's perfect.

311
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,960
-不是吧  -我得把它抓來
- What? Oh, - I’m gonna grab it.

312
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,860
餓死了  終于要開餐了  弟兄們
I'm so hungry. Now we get to eat, boys.

313
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,390
哥們  那看起來像是死的
Dude, that looks dead.

314
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,740
伙計們  積極一點兒
Guys, stop being negative right now.

315
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,540
一面翻上來表示它已經死了
Laying on its side means it's dead.

316
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,740
我才不想進到水里呢  哥們
I wouldn't get in that water, man.

317
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,430
你會得賈第蟲病的
You're gonna get beaver fever.

318
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,570
現在誰是孬種啊  教練
Where are my testicles now, Coach?

319
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,720
等他逮到那個小可憐時
When he catches that little critter,

320
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,430
我會給你表演怎么給它刮鱗
I'm gonna show you how to scale it.

321
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,630
疼嗎
That hurts?

322
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,450
當然疼了
Yeah, it hurts!

323
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,940
一塊石頭掉在了我的...
A boulder fell on my...

324
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,800
你這么做是因為我取笑你的邀請嗎
Is all this 'cause I teased you about the invite?

325
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,360
是的  義無反顧
Yes, it is! No regrets!

326
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,420
拜托  尼克
Aw! Aw, come on, Nick.

327
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,150
-成功了  -別鬧了
- Yes! - Quit it.

328
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,330
你們可能是對的  它可能是死的
You guys might be right! It might be dead!

329
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,070
事實上  確實是死魚
In fact, it was dead!

330
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,870
聞著還挺...新鮮
Smells fresh... enough!

331
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,360
拜托  溫斯頓
Oh, come on, Winston, what?

332
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,820
你剛做完指甲還是怎么著  把蘋果弄臟
You just get your nails done? Get the apple dirty!

333
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,960
蹭點兒灰塵上去
Grind some dirt in it, grind some dirt in it.

334
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,160
-我的神啊  好餓  -嗨
- God, I'm so hungry! - Hey, hey!

335
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,600
看男人們帶回來了什么
Hey. Look what the men brought.

336
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,640
-哎呦  不錯呦  -計劃湊效了
- Oh, hey! Hey, hey! - The plan worked.

337
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,870
他看起來像個斗士
Hey, he looks like a fighter.

338
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,790
他確實算是  某種程度上說
He really was, kind of.

339
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,930
-神啊  -哇
- Oh, my God! - Wow.

340
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:16,830
-不算什么啦  -哇
- I mean, well... - Whoa.

341
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,240
-像自助餐一樣  -你們干得很好
- Like a smorgasbord. - You guys did great.

342
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,150
-是啊  -對
- Yeah, we did. - Yep.

343
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,230
你們從哪弄的腰果
Where'd you get the cashews?

344
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,390
-灌木叢上  -對
- Um, on a bush. - Yeah.

345
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,030
甜菜呢
How about the beets?

346
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,370
-也是灌木上的  -沒錯
- Also a bush. - That's right.

347
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:28,870
好吧
Yeah.

348
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,160
那牛油果呢
The avocado?

349
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,610
-還是灌木上  -是的
- Also on a bush. - That's right.

350
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,980
看看我們  離家遠行
Well, look at us. Living off the land,

351
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,460
自力更生
fending for ourselves.

352
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,550
我們有魚還有水果
We got fish and fruits,

353
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,670
還有這個可能是我這輩子
and this is probably gonna be the most delicious apple

354
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,660
吃過的最好吃的蘋果
I've ever eaten in my life.

355
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,840
為什么是俄勒岡州生產
"Product of Oregon"?

356
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,530
我們剛才居然走到俄勒岡州了
We walked to Oregon?

357
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,480
-啥  -怎么可能
- What? - What?

358
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,820
-難怪抽筋呢  -是啊  -這地方...
- That's why this cramp... - Yeah... - This place...

359
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,440
拜托  你們真以為我們三個是笨蛋嗎
Come on, you think the three of us are true dumb-asses?

360
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,070
我們不是  從開始我就差不多知道了
We're not. I kind of knew from the beginning.

361
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,920
你們不可能做到的
I mean, there's no way.

362
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,890
這些都是你們從商店買的吧
You just went to a store and got all this?

363
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,000
我覺得是
I think so.

364
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,370
我覺得這些都是他們買來的
I think they definitely bought everything from the store.

365
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,770
我想要的就是
The one thing I wanted

366
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,890
大家一起坐下來吃頓晚飯
was for us all to sit down together and have dinner,

367
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,780
沒有東西吃怎么行
and you can't do that without dinner.

368
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,020
我們有東西吃
We have dinner.

369
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,890
那魚看起來有點像河馬肉
That fish kind of looks like hippo meat.

370
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,980
哥們  別這樣
Come on, man.

371
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,500
讓我們坐下來
Let's just sit down

372
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,310
品嘗美味的扁桃仁吧
and eat some delicious almonds.

373
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,450
-好好享受  -是啊
- And enjoy ourselves. - Yes.

374
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,570
一起好好過一個感恩節
And have a really nice Thanksgiving together.

375
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,650
拜托了  尼克  開吃吧
Come on, Nick, let's eat.

376
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,580
別鬧了  哥們  開吃吧
Come on, man, let's eat.

377
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,330
我有種第一個感恩節時人們的感覺
I feel like how they must've felt on the first Thanksgiving.

378
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,870
被背叛了
Betrayed.

379
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,770
-尼克  -啥
- Nick - What?

380
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,350
你們過你們的吧
Happy Thanksgiving.

381
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,690
-拜托  尼克  -別這樣
- Oh, come on. Nick, come on! - Don't do this.

382
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,370
得告訴你一下  首個感恩節挺和諧的
FYI, the first Thanksgiving was the good one.

383
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,850
別鬧了  尼克
Come on, Nick!

384
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,870
這些牛油果很貴的
These avocados were expensive!

385
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,800
開吃
Here we go.

386
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,150
好香啊
It smells so good.

387
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,990
我都等不及了
I can't wait till it's ready.

388
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,650
會撐死我的
I'm gonna be so stuffed.

389
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,670
魚眼睛掉了
The eyeball fell off.

390
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,950
你就知道它有多鮮美了
That's how you know it's good.

391
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,850
當烤好的時候它們就會掉出來
They got to pop out when it's ready, I think.

392
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,400
現在終于可以攤牌了
Now that the cards are finally on the table,

393
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,700
我們知道誰才是真正的露營大師了
I guess we can see who the true camp master really is.

394
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,820
-答案就是我  -誰先生好火誰就贏
- The answer's me. - First one to make a flame wins.

395
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,650
開動吧
Let's do this.

396
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,090
看好了
Now, check this out.

397
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,330
哥教你怎么生火
This is how you make a flame.

398
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,360
你那兩塊石頭  這么互相敲
You go with two rocks. One against the other.

399
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,630
產生摩擦
You create friction.

400
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,220
-搞定了  -啥
- I'm done. - What?

401
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,840
-搞定了  -那算不上火苗  快滅了都
- I'm done. - Well, that's barely a flame, it's going out.

402
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,390
我的個親娘啊  你是誰  巫師嗎
Whoa! Well, goodness gracious! What are you? A sorcerer?

403
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,850
媽的
Damn it!

404
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,260
山頂洞人
Hey, mountain man.

405
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,570
你想過來和我們一起吃些臟的蔬菜嗎
You want to come eat some dirty vegetables with us?

406
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,100
我應該猜到那甜菜不是野生的
I should've known those beets weren't from nature.

407
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,490
野生的長不出紫色
Nothing purple grows in nature.

408
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,570
聽著  我們沒有挺過來  好吧
Look, we didn't come through, okay?

409
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,210
你堅持下來了
You came through!

410
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,830
你都抓了條魚
Look, you caught a fish!

411
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,080
真了不起
That's really, really impressive.

412
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,730
你怎么做到的
How'd you do it?

413
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,400
空手抓的
With my bare hands.

414
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,230
-不是吧  你太強了  -是啊
- No way! You're so strong. - Yeah.

415
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,310
當時是...我和它搏斗來著...
Yeah, it was... It fought...

416
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
你想干嘛
What are you doing?

417
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,710
我沒想干嘛  我覺得太了不起了
I'm not doing anything. I think that's amazing.

418
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,290
你為我們帶來食物
You provided for us.

419
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,430
-你是男人  -別恭維我  杰茜
- You're a man. - Don't patronize me, Jess.

420
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,750
-沒有啊  -自從我們開始交往  杰茜
- I'm not. - Ever since we started dating, Jess,

421
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,800
做了好多女孩才做的事
we've been doing a bunch of girly stuff,

422
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,270
有些我挺喜歡  而且我喜歡你  但是
and I like some of it and you, but...

423
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,060
我的酒量已經...
My tolerance to alcohol has, like,

424
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,860
低得嚇人了
gotten really, scary low.

425
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,690
喝三罐啤酒
I drank three beers, and I got,

426
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,360
我就笑嘻嘻的  還犯困
like, all giggly and tired.

427
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,950
不想再喝了
And I didn't want a fourth.

428
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,150
昨晚我做了個夢  夢見刷洗一匹馬
Last night, I had a dream that I was brushing a horse.

429
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,320
感覺我有點找不到自我了
I just feel like I'm losing myself a little.

430
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:21,820
你就...
Just...

431
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,610
讓我吃了這條惡心的魚吧
Let me eat this disgusting fish and...

432
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,990
-不  尼克  尼克  -讓我死這兒得了
- No, Nick, Nick. - Yeah, just let me be over here.

433
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,240
這是我見過的最漂亮的魚
This is the most beautiful fish I've ever seen.

434
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,070
-別碰  我就不碰它  -真的很漂亮
- Don't touch... I wouldn't touch it. - It is! It is.

435
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,300
杰茜  不要  別把手伸進...
Jess, don't... Don't put your hands in...

436
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,570
我的天...
Oh, my lo...

437
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,320
吐出來
Spit it out.

438
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,140
芳香滿口
Fragrant.

439
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,070
我能嘗到湖水的滋味
Mmm, I can really... I can really taste the lake.

440
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,910
-吐出來  -我覺得自己在湖里與魚嬉戲
- Spit it out. - I feel like I'm there in the lake with the fish.

441
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,250
有刺
Bony.

442
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,040
咽下去的時候有點疼
That's gonna hurt going down.

443
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,760
但是我喜歡
But I like it.

444
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,330
痛得好開心  痛得好開心
Hurts so good! Hurts so good!

445
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,120
杰茜  我抓到這條魚的時候它已經死了
Jess, that fish was dead when I caught it.

446
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,510
還有只襪子浮在旁邊
There was a sock near it.

447
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,970
-我陪著你  -不要
- I'm gonna come with you. - No.

448
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,330
杰茜  讓我陪你吧
Jess, let me come with you.

449
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,590
-你去哪  -這邊有東西
- Where are you going? - There's something over here.

450
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,770
-我去看看  -杰茜
- I'm gonna look at it. - Jess...

451
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,710
我看到了一些有意思的東西
I'm seeing some interesting things.

452
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,860
我星期五之前都不在辦公室
I'm out of the office till Friday.

453
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,610
需要緊急援助

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,280
杰茜

459
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,770
杰茜  杰茜

460
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,080
杰茜
Jess?

461
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,890
杰茜
Jess!

462
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,070
做決定之前
I just want to see more carpet samples

463
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,630
我想多看看地毯樣品
before I make a final decision.

464
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,540
杰茜
Jess!

465
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,540
杰茜
Jess?

466
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,370
杰茜  杰茜  你在哪

467
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,190
-杰茜  -杰茜卡
- Jess! - Jessica!

468
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,700
天啊  都是我的錯
Oh, God, this is all my fault.

469
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,670
你知道嗎教練  我很喜歡那封請柬
You know what coach, I did like the invitation.

470
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,180
是我做的  我喜歡那個小號手
I made it. And I liked the little trumpet guy.

471
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,320
我覺得他很可愛
I thought he was cute.

472
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,710
- 這創意好得不得了  -什么
It's genius as a damn button! - What?

473
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,980
這么多石頭
So many stone...

474
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,180
伙計們快看  她在哪
Hey, guys, look. There she is!

475
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,310
這有好多狗印著美元的符號
There are dogs that have dollar signs

476
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,920
但卻沒有自己的銀行
but don't even own banks.

477
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,050
杰茜  我們在這  杰茜
Jess, we're over here! Jess!

478
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:15,730
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait.

479
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,630
那棵樹好像以前在哪見過  杰茜  停下
I've seen that tree before. Jess, stop!

480
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,710
捕熊的陷阱
The bear trap!

481
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,960
-不要  -我來了
- No! - I'm coming!

482
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,950
杰茜
Jess!

483
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,500
頭先著地  為什么
Headfirst? Why?

484
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,240
他大爺...
Son of a...

485
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,610
天啊  杰茜  真抱歉
Oh, my God, Jess, I am so sorry.

486
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,480
我是笨蛋
I was an idiot.

487
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,410
這個感恩節計劃太蠢了
This Thanksgiving plan was so stupid.

488
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,480
你不該吃那條魚  太對不起了
You shouldn't have eaten that fish. I'm sorry.

489
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,320
別讓他們付賬單  好嗎
Don't let them pay the bill, okay?

490
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,320
把支票給我
You bring the check to me.

491
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,930
不吵架了  月亮人
No arguments, moon man.

492
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,880
我的天
Oh, my God!

493
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,910
有人受傷嗎
Is anyone hurt?

494
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,790
我們沒事  我可能有幾根肋骨骨裂了
We're fine. I may have cracked a few ribs,

495
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,870
杰茜神經錯亂了
and, uh, Jess is delirious.

496
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,550
我猜她以為自己是兔子
I think she thinks she's a rabbit.

497
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,220
伙計們  我們會想辦法  好嗎
Guys, we're gonna figure something out, all right?

498
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,980
給我們扔條繩子或者棍子  其他什么也行
Just get us a rope or a stick or something.

499
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,630
-好吧  伙計有什么主意  -你在說什么
- All right, man, so, any ideas? - What are you talk...?

500
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,190
你自己知道  教練  別跟我打哈哈
You know what, Coach? Don't humor me.

501
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,850
-什么啊  -你知道該做什么
- What? - You know what to do.

502
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,090
聽著  我承認  你露營的本事比我好
Look, I admit it. You're a better camper than I am.

503
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,250
你的人生也比我好
You're better at life than I am.

504
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,480
沒準跟希希約會也比我好
You're probably better at dating Cece than I am.

505
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,350
那天晚上我看到你們了
I saw you guys the other night

506
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,890
在家門口卿卿我我
inhaling each other in front of the loft.

507
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,580
施密特  我們就干了那么點兒事  就沒了
Schmidt, that's all we did. That was it.

508
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,810
我問她要不要上樓  她說不要  好嗎
I asked her to come upstairs, she said no, okay?

509
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,570
現在她都不回我短信了
And now she won't return any of my text messages.

510
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,340
整個旅行她都無視我
She's been ignoring me this whole trip.

511
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,460
我一直是"你好哇"  她卻"嗯"
I'm all, like, "Hey." She's like, "Mm-hmm."

512
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,010
我就想"什么情況"
I'm like, "What?"

513
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,040
-你笑什么  伙計  -我沒笑
- Why are you smiling, dude? - I'm not smiling.

514
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,300
我在這跟你交心呢伙計
I'm over here baring my soul to you, dude,

515
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,710
而你卻當著我的面鬼笑
and you're freaking smiling in my face. Yeah.

516
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,870
我傾聽的時候都是這種表情
This is the face I make when I listen.

517
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,670
-你傾聽的時候所有牙都呲出來嗎  -沒有
-All your teeth show when you listen? - I'm not.

518
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,250
你還在笑  我跟你坦誠相待
You're smiling right now. I opened up to you.

519
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,040
-你卻惹我生氣  別笑了  -我沒笑
- You're pissing me off. Stop smiling. - I'm not.

520
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,830
我弄死你  你個瘋子
I will wreck you. You're crazy, man.

521
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,350
-你神經病  -住手  聽我說
- You're nuts. - Stop it, listen to me.

522
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,110
我們必須馬上解決這事
We are going to solve this right now.

523
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,680
好嗎  把褲子脫了
All right, take your pants off.

524
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,830
好吧  我不是什么鷹級童子軍
Okay, I am no Eagle Scout,

525
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,610
但我會把褲子綁成繩子
but I know how to make a pants rope.

526
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,220
-褲繩  -你真天才
- Pants rope. - You're a genius.

527
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,310
我知道  -好?
I know. - Okay.

528
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,000
你也脫褲子嗎
Are you gonna take off your pants?

529
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,650
是的  等我脫掉我的
Yeah, right after I take off

530
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,480
胸罩之后我們就可以把繩子扔到樹上了
my bra so we can anchor the rope to the tree.

531
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,300
-真的會發生嗎  -快點脫掉吧
- That's gonna happen for real? - Just take them off now.

532
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,090
看看溫斯頓的內褲
Whoa, look at Winston's pants.

533
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,840
上面還有小貓
It's got kittens on it.

534
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,550
不是貓
These aren't kittens.

535
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,080
我不敢相信我竟然是自愿來這里的
I cannot believe I'm here voluntarily.

536
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,450
-太傻了  -脫掉
- So stupid. - Take them off.

537
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,770
脫掉咯
They're coming off.

538
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,000
你們兩個  抓住繩子
Here, you guys, grab hold of the rope.

539
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,420
好了  你先請  杰茜
Okay, you go first, Jess.

540
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,570
我跟在你后面支援你
I'll be right behind you to support you.

541
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,800
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

542
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,210
這樣吧  我背著你  咱倆一起上去
Okay, how about this? Get on my back, I'll bring us both up.

543
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,450
上來了
Back at you.

544
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,750
你能做到
You can do it!

545
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,990
給你  拿著手電筒
There, hold this flashlight, buddy.

546
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,560
抓住
Grab hold.

547
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,100
快  尼克  加油  加油
Come on, Nick! Come on. Here we go!

548
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,240
上帝  我要把你弄出去
Oh, God, I'm gonna get you out of here.

549
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,710
你的腿也用上  尼克
Use your legs, Nick.

550
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,180
加油  尼克
Come on, Nick!

551
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,190
加油
Come on.

552
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,760
溫斯頓  我討厭你的打底褲  加油
Ah, Winston, I hate your leggings. Come on.

553
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,610
快到了
Almost there.

554
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,170
-加油  -上來了
- Let's go. - You got it,

555
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,490
成功了
you got it.

556
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,080
成功了
You got it, you...

557
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,830
你個大胖混蛋
You chubby son of a bitch.

558
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,090
罵得好
Yeah.

559
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,450
你還好嗎  杰茜  沒事吧
You okay, Jess, you all right?

560
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,820
希爾貝利急救中心

561
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,260
謝謝你救了我  山頂洞人
Thanks for saving me, mountain man.

562
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,880
我有條來自醫生的好消息
So I've got good news from the doctor

563
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,170
你沒得狂犬病
you don't have rabies.

564
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,670
你身上有賈第鞭毛蟲
You have, uh, giardia

565
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,070
和一種叫軍團病的疾病
and something called Legionnaires' disease.

566
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,530
我很高興他們能保住你的腳
I'm just glad they were able to save your foot.

567
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,090
什么
What?

568
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,140
沒  沒什么
No, nothing.

569
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,160
別在意
Never mind.

570
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:36,470
我很抱歉整個野營的事
Hey, I'm sorry about the whole camping thing.

571
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,940
不  沒事的
Oh, no, it's okay.

572
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,410
我真傻
Ah, I was really stupid.

573
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,990
我不像我自己了
I haven't been myself.

574
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,210
你是我想要的男人
You're the man I want.

575
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,000
你想要的只是讓大家
All you wanted was for everyone

576
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,800
在感恩節能一起過  杰茜
to be together on Thanksgiving, Jess.

577
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,110
明年吧
Next year.

578
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,500
-薯片  -薯片
- Potato chips. - Chips?

579
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,940
你請客
Maybe a treat.

580
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,810
聽著  教練  本著感恩節的精神
Listen, Coach, uh, in the spirit of Thanksgiving,

581
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,910
我想也許我可以給你
I thought maybe that I could give you

582
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,500
有關希希的一些建議
some advice about... about Cece.

583
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,100
你認為我有多絕望
How desperate do you think I am?

584
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,370
我認為你或許非常絕望
I think you're probably very desperate.

585
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,490
我非常絕望  我的意思是
I'm very desperate, I mean,

586
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,800
她什么像樣的回應都沒有
she's giving me nothing.

587
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,910
對她說她很漂亮  她說謝謝
Told her she looked pretty, she said thanks.

588
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,220
那算哪門子心理戰
Mm-hmm. What kind of mind game is that?

589
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,690
教練  任何事對你而言都輕而易舉
Look, Coach, things have always come easy to you.

590
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,260
但希希不會成為那些事之一
Cece is not going to be one of those things.

591
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,580
我有一次曾經在一輛車窗上砸了
I once spent hours in a car

592
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,330
一個透氣孔的車里待了好幾個小時
with just a cracked window for air.

593
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,440
她進了一家俱樂部
She was going into a club

594
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,020
把我一個人扔在外面
and she just kind of left me there.

595
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,890
你為什么要笑
Why are you smiling about that?

596
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,800
伙計們  我想到一個挽救感恩節的辦法
Hey, guys, I figured out a way to save Thanksgiving.

597
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:41,890
-我有個計劃  -我受夠計劃了
- I got a plan. - Enough with the plans.

598
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,240
-你安排計劃的能力糟透了  -否決尼克·米勒的計劃
- You suck at plans! - Not another Nick Miller plan.

599
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,360
我愛你  但是你的計劃真的超爛
I love you, man, but you are terrible at plans.

600
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,170
現在才11點48分  感恩節快樂
It's still 11:48, so happy Thanksgiving.

601
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,180
什么
What?

602
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,090
我們有巴西堅果
Got us some Brazilian nuts,

603
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,700
幾個字母奶酪  還有點心
a couple of string cheeses, and snack.

604
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,820
謝謝
Thank you.

605
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,370
我手機上可以看感恩節游行
I got the parade on my phone.

606
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:58,870
太棒了
Yes.

607
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,580
做了一些裝飾
Made some decorations.

608
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,490
我想這個也許是火雞三明治
I think this may be a turkey sandwich,

609
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,350
不過我不確定
but I'm not sure,

610
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,100
我也知道這一切并不是
and I know this whole thing isn't...

611
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,810
很完美
It's perfect.

612
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,720
大家  你們開動吧別管我
Look, guys, start without me

613
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,830
因為我估計得過幾個星期才能吃東西了
because it might be a few weeks before I can eat again.

614
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,800
你吐了很多東西出來
You were throwing up a lot.

615
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,240
那太可怕了  真的
That was scary... seriously.

616
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,150
-我餓了  我們開吃吧  -開吃
- Okay, I'm starving actually. Let's eat. - Yeah, let's eat.

617
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,180
尼克在森林里找到的這些吃的
Nick found all this food in the woods.

618
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,150
我能喝姜汁汽水嗎
Can I have the ginger ale?

619
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,770
沒問題  尼克找到的  已經開了
Yeah, Nick found that. It's already open.
