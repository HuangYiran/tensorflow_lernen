1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,100
Previously on Haven...

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,000
This is Nathan. He's the "way to my heart" guy.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,200
When I cut his head open, I found this.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,400
- That was in his brain? 
- Yep.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,900
You... this whole day, the black goo, all the delusions...

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,400
you infected my friends, and you put that mark on those people.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,600
I'm just trying to get through to you.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,500
- You're immune to The Troubles. 
- Just like you.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,700
I want you back.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,700
Find the Troubled person, or the hansons die.

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,200
I wouldn't help you, not in this world or any other.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,600
Yeah, you will, 'cause if you don't, more people are gonna die...

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,200
and people that Audrey Parker cares about.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,600
William can't get away with this. I didn't come here to talk.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,400
So I'm gonna tell you everything you want to know

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,900
about who she is and what we did, 'cause we are so connected.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,600
Got the logo, coming around the van, and action.

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,000
Greetings, Seekers. Welcome to Haven, Maine.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
As always, I'm Seth byrne, joined by my steady hand behind the camera, Anderson Harris.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,700
And we are The Darkside Seekers.

21
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,500
Say hello, Anderson.

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,500
Hello, Seekers. It is I, Anderson Harris.

23
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,000
Welcome to hell.

24
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,100
- That's a weird voice, dude. 
- Thanks, buddy.

25
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,200
We'll cut it out.

26
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,800
We've come to Haven to investigate a murder.

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,000
The victim was found missing his heart.

28
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,600
Think that's strange? Well, we thought so too.

29
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,600
Ooh. Easy, there, big guy. Walking's tough, huh?

30
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,500
This is a new shirt, so that sucks.

31
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,700
Well, that's gonna smell good.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,100
Okay, let's take it from the top.

33
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,500
No, no, we're fine. I can cut around it.

34
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,400
- Yeah? 
- Yeah, man.

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
- Yeah? Okay. 
- The magic of editing.

36
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
All right, well, your mustache looks good. You ready?

37
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,100
- Yeah. 
- Clean. Ready?

38
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,400
- Yeah. Hold on. 
- Three, two... 

39
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,000
And... Action.

40
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,900
This isn't the first strange thing we've heard about Haven.

41
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,900
If you know where to look, Haven is home to all kinds of paranormal activity,

42
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,400
like haunted houses or shape-shifters, maybe even a golem.

43
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,500
But the law enforcement here, with help from the local daily rag, cover it up.

44
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,400
They say, "it was a freak accident,"

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,700
or maybe insect migration.

46
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,700
Or... this is my personal favorite... a gas leak.

47
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,300
I mean, a gas leak? I mean, what?

48
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,000
How many gas leaks does a small fishing village need to have 

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
before they get new pipes?

50
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,600
Is something a man might wonder.

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,100
Recently we've been receiving strange readings from our devices,

52
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,100
which have led us to this house, where we hope to find clues to...

53
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,500
What the hell was that? Is there something in there?

54
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,000
Dude, look, look, look. Come on.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,400
- Is the door open? 
- Come on, come on, come on.

56
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,200
- Please, come on. 
- Seth, do not go inside there.

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,100
- Dude, we are going inside. 
- I'm not going inside there.

58
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,200
Dude, you are going in.

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,900
The door is ripped off.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't go in there.

61
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,900
Oh, my God, dude, turn that off, please.

62
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,900
??????????

63
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,200
- This thing actually works? 
- Yeah. Duh

64
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,100
Wait. Hang on. It's too dark.

65
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,400
I can't see anything. Let me adjust the camera.

66
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, for God sakes, just hurry up.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,100
- We want to find this. 
- Okay, okay.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,100
Jeez. Really?

69
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,200
Can... can we get a shot of this?

70
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,000
Look at the... look at the space between the talons here, right?

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,800
I'm guessing this thing is about ten feet.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,200
And based on what we know about its feeding habits... oh, God.

73
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,100
What happened here?

74
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Look at this.

75
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,800
Is that the lady's blood?

76
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,400
Yeah, I know, I know, I know. Just quiet, okay?

77
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Don't go in there.

78
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,300
I'm gonna go in there... 'Cause I have to go in there.

79
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,100
- Get out! 
- What?

80
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,500
Go! Just go!

81

84
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,100
So what do you think?

85
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,700
Well, it'd be a cute rental if it wasn't totally wrecked...

86
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,700
claw marks, smashed TV, the whole "bull in the China shop" motif.

87
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,600
- About the victim, Gloria. 
- Abby banks...schoolteacher, and from the looks of the rug,

88
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,000
she just finished eating dinner... chicken tikka masala.

89
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,400
Can we focus on what's still in the victim?

90
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,200
Yeah, well, funny you should bring that up.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Okay, so we've got claw and bite marks here, there...

92
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,600
This is what spilled the dinner, but that's not what killed her.

93
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,500
Just like the last one we found, this Vic's heart is gone,

94
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,600
like it was eaten right out of her chest.

95
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,200
"Eaten"?

96
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,500
Yeah, well, they look like teeth marks to me.

97
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,800
Anyway, whatever this trouble is, it's big and mean, and it's...

98
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,800
Don't be shushing me, silverback.

99
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,600
Look.

100
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,700
Well, what do you know?

101
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,500
Another body found with its heart eaten.

102
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,000
Pair that with what we saw last night,

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and, Seekers, it looks like we found ourselves a rougarou.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,500
Oh, I don't think that's how you say that.

105
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,800
Dude, can I... do you mind if I just do this?

106
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,900
Ready. And action.

107
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,600
A rougarou is a supernatural creature out of ancient folklore.

108
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,000
A cousin of the werewolf, rougarous were once men,

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,500
but are now monsters, driven to feed on the hearts of their victims.

110
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,400
What about the stuff she was saying to officer Bigfoot about Troubles?

111
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
What are The Troubles?

112
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,900
Great question, Anderson. I don't know.

113
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,600
But it's obvious that they're trying to hide something from the outside world.

114
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,700
And as Seekers, it's our job to find out.

115
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,000
Find out what? You can't be recording. This is an ongoing police investigation.

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,200
- You're ruining the shot, dude. 
- You want to end up on wikileaks, huh?

117
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,500
What about the claw marks? Why are you suppressing the truth?

118
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,700
- Turn off the camera. 
- Do not turn off that camera.

119
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,000
This is a public thoroughfare. We can record what we want.

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,500
Since when is there no freedom of the press in Maine, huh?

121
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,900
- What are you, some kind of a fascist? 
- What are you, a fascist?

122
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,400
I wish there was something more I could do for Audrey.

123
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,000
Actually, there may be something you can do.

124
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,300
If anybody knows about this connection between Audrey and William, it's Vince and Dave.

125
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,900
How would you feel about going back to the herald and...

126
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,500
Doing the journalist thing, seeing if you can find anything out.

127
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,300
- Okay. What are you gonna do?
 - Help Nathan.

128
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,500
He's torn up about Audrey, and I just...

129
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,800
I think he's gonna need someone backing him up...

130
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,300
Even if I'm not as cute as his regular partner.

131
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,700
I disagree.

132
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,100
- Be safe. 
- Okay. See you soon.

133
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,800
The bullet missed major organs,

134
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,000
but I am not buying that you just dug it out.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,800
- Is it in there? 
- Better if it were.

136
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,900
Could help staunch blood flow, like it's doing for that guy,

137
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,900
 who, save for the bullet, has the exact same wound. Hmm. Weird.

138
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,600
Okay. I'll start getting an O.R. ready.

139
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,600
What happened?

140
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,000
William kept saying that we were connected.

141
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,100
I guess it's real... Physically.

142
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,000
Look, if hurting him is gonna hurt Audrey,

143
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,700
that is gonna make him very hard to deal with.

144
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,500
How long can we keep William sedated?

145
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,400
I say we dope him up forever.

146
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll stick the needles in myself.

147
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,200
Thanks.

148
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,700
Audrey, how are you?

149
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,400
- She's gonna be fine. 
- Oh, thank God.

150
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,000
Nathan, we need you.

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Another person has been killed... heart gone.

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's a trouble.

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,100
When isn't it?

154
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,700
That's not all.

155
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,700
Some ghost chasers have come to Haven.

156
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,500
So what? Chase them off.

157
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,000
You know how to deal with outsiders.

158
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,800
Too late. They've hacked into the herald's computers,

159
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,000
and they now know about the heart eater.

160
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,300
They're calling it a rougarou.

161
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:38,100
- But if they chase down their monster,they'll find a Troubled person. 
- Okay, okay.

162
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,800
We've all seen real Bigfoot housewives.

163
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,600
Nobody takes these conspiracy guys seriously.

164
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,700
But these Troubles are real.

165
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,900
And if these darkside Seekers find some evidence...

166
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,700
Then every government agency we know of, and some we don't, will be here,

167
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,000
getting in the way of a deadly trouble.

168
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
That's right.

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Nathan, you can't do the surgery.

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,200
So why don't you and Duke go solve this trouble?

171
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,900
Make sure it doesn't kill anyone else.

172
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,100
That way, they won't have anything else to chase.

173
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,300
Please. Do it for me.

174
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,000
Come on.

175
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,600
How are you really feeling?

176
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:50,200


177
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,900
You know me better than I know myself.

178
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,900
Please, do you know anything about William?

179
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,600
We don't, I swear.

180
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,100
This is uncharted territory for all of us.

181
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:08,100
William kept saying that we're connected, even more than this gunshot wound.

182
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,300
And when we were up on the hill... I felt it.

183
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,300
There is something there.

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And it terrifies me.

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,500
Audrey, what is it?

186
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:29,900
William said that he and I are responsible for The Troubles.

187
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,700
They're here because of us, because of me.

188
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,200
No. I can't believe that.

189
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,600
I don't want to believe it either, but there's a part of me that...

190
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,600
Thinks he might be telling the truth.

191
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,100
- Have you told Nathan? 
- No.

192
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,300
No.

193
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,600
Her name's jemma Greene... renovates commercial properties, best friends with our last victim.

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,100
Phone records show she was talking to Abby just before the attack.

195
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,300
We'd been best friends since the day we were born.

196
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,200
I just can't believe someone would do that to her.

197
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,300
Someone or something?

198
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,500
Hey, you two, out.

199
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,900
This is an active police investigation.

200
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,300
Hey, you guys, smile for the camera while you're oppressing our rights.

201
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,800
And arresting you? Okay, I will.

202
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,400
Calm down. Okay?

203
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,100
Look, I don't think anybody's gonna have to get arrested

204
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,500
because that camera looks broken to me.

205
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,700
Oh, you playing bad cop today, ponytail?

206
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,600
Just keep rolling. He can't arrest us.

207
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,500
Yeah, I know he can't arrest us, which is why I'm gonna keep exercising

208
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,600
my first-amendment right of free speech and ask you, Mr. ponytail,

209
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,100
don't you feel like grunge died in the '90s?

210
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,000
Really? I'm trying to be nice to you.

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,500
- I'm just trying to be nice to you. 
- Okay, I'm gonna kick his ass now.

212
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,700
Give me that camera. Give me that camera!

213
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,400
Give me that camera!

214
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,000
- okay
- ????

215
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,300
Don't shoot anymore. It's not rolling.

216
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,200
Everyone just stay calm, try to be quiet.

217
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,300
- Okay, okay, okay. 
- Let's get out the back.

218
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:18,100
- I'll take the lead. Duke, here...
 - Thanks.

219
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,100
- Ready? 
- Yeah.

220
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,600
Let's get out the back. I like this plan.

221
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,300
I'll follow you. Go, go, go.

222
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,300
Let's go.

223
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,800
Wait, wait.

224
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,100
Wait. I think it's gone.

225
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,300
Are you sure?

226
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,300
Okay. Let's get out of here.

227
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,700
Go, go, go, go, go.

228
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,100
- What is that? 
- Where is it? Where is it?

229
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,000
- What is it? 
- Shh, shh, shh.

230
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,000
Get down. Get down.

231
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,000
Go! Go!

232
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,800
- Oh, my God! 
- Keep going!

233
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
Come on! Come on!

234
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,800
Get down! Get down!

235
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,800
Where the hell is it?

236
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,600
All right, all right, we got to go.

237
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,400
Come on, let's go. That way.

238
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,400
It's okay.

239
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
Jemma, where are you?

240
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
Nathan! Nathan!

241
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,700
- Where's jemma? 
- She was with you.

242
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,900
I lost her.

243
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,500
Nathan, I think I found the breaker box.

244
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
There she is.

245
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,500
What was that?

246
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Call it in. I'll see what else I can find.

247
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,400
You two all right?

248
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,700
Is she dead?

249
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,600
You record any of it?

250
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,100
no. I, uh...

251
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,500
I was so scared, I'm... Lucky I didn't break the camera.

252
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Right.

253
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,500
That was crazy. I mean, that thing just went right for her.

254
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,100
And when we got separated, I just... I just panicked.

255
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,000
Hey, Seth.

256
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,700
- Yeah. 
- Take a look at this.

257
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,400
Wait. You got it?

258
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,400
Damn right. I was up and running.

259
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Look at that thing.

260
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,700
We got it on camera.

261
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,900
- So this arugula... 
- Rougarou.

262
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,300
And we don't know that. 

263
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:16,200
Well, what we do know is what it wants, and that is hearts.

264
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,000
These other wounds like the gashed forearm,

265
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,300
the missing fingers... they're just defensive.

266
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Why the heart?

267
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,900
That's your job, detective. I just figure out the what.

268
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,400
The why... that's up to you and, uh, your honorary deputy over there.

269
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,300
I actually prefer consulting detective.

270
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,900
Oh, a Sherlock fan.

271
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,800
Well, what does your deductive reasoning make of this?

272
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,200
Traces found in all the victims.

273
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,700
- I'm gonna go with blood, Bob. 
- Well, you'd be 90% right.

274
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,400
But there's other stuff mixed in there, and I'm trying to separate it out with a centrifuge.

275
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,900
It's thicker than blood, sticky... maybe saliva?

276
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,300
I don't know, but it's from the Troubled person...

277
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,700
Which is why I've already put him for a rush on the DNA test.

278
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,100
Thank you, Gloria.

279
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,400
Got it. 

280
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,900
- The people have a right... 
- Those little twerps. 

281
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,300
I will handle this. You'd just make things worse. Meet me at the station.

282
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,100
I wasn't gonna do anything.

283
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,200
You want to see something cool?

284
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,400
So where's the freedom fighter... out seeking the truth?

285
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,900
- Thai food... he gets hungry. 
- What do you want?

286
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,400
Look, I saw the thing. I know the truth.

287
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,000
I know what you're covering up in there.
And hold on a second. People, man...

288
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,800
the people have a right to know the truth as well.

289
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
The truth is there's a deep, dark pond off route 9.

290
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,300
Nobody goes there. Your buddy's not here. Why don't we see if you can swim, huh?

291
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,100
Hey, hey, you know you're not getting in there, right?

292
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,500
Yeah. And at this point, I don't care.

293
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,700
You know why? Because we have the footage.

294
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:55,200
We have real, actual footage of a supernatural monster.

295
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,300
And you know what else?

296
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,000
And...

297
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,300
You are really gonna love this.

298
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:06,100
We have recordings of conversations among Haven law enforcement discussing a conspiracy to cover it up.

299
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,700
Can you believe that?

300
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,800
So what I'm proposing is this... we form kind of like a partnership?

301
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,200
You let us tag around on the case. We get enough footage to finish the episode,

302
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,400
and then this little illegal conversation of yours...

303
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,500
it just accidentally gets left on the cutting room floor.

304
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Here's my offer.

305
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,300
We take your equipment, put it on the ground, and you watch, politely,

306
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,400
as I smash every piece of it.

307
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,000
From there, we grab your buddy on the way to the edge of town,

308
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,800
and we light your van on fire.

309
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,300
And if you don't like that plan, I can always leave you inside the van. Deal?

310
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,700
Go ahead. Smash my stuff.

311
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,900
And anyways, it doesn't matter because all of our footage

312
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,600
is just automatically uploaded onto a secure server on the cloud.

313
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,400
So, sorry, buddy.

314
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,000
- Dwight, just calm down. 
- Okay, I'm good.

315
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,900
- What? 
- I'm done pissing him off.

316
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,000
I was just trying to get under his skin so that
 he'd slip up and let us know where they're uploading their footage.

317
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,100
I can have Jennifer digging through those files by the time we get to the station.

318
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,000
Jennifer can do that?

319
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,700
As far as I can tell, everyone younger than me can do that.

320
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,700
How's she doing?

321
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,300
Still in surgery. She's through the rough patch.

322
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,800
How are you doing?

323
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Right.

324
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,700
Fine.

325
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,600
Look, I just... I don't know. Today it's a phantom bullet.

326
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,900
Before that, she was stuck in an alternate reality.

327
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,800
Every day I wake up, I think, "today is gonna be the day that I'm gonna lose her. "

328
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,600
But you Haven't lost her.

329
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,100
Look, Nathan, she is tough as nails.

330
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,300
More importantly, she has us.

331
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,200
She has you to protect her.

332
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,800
That's just it.

333
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,900
I don't know if I know how to protect her anymore.

334
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,700
- What are you talking about? 
- I... William.

335
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,800
Her and William.

336
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,000
How can I protect her against that?

337
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,000
- How can I compete with that?
- Hey, let me explain something to you.

338
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,800
In case you've forgotten, she went into that barn.

339
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:39,200
She sacrificed herself for the one person that she loved most in this world.

340
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,900
- Yeah. That's you, buddy. 
- William... he knows everything about her.

341
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,600
They have this connection.

342
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,100
He doesn't know Audrey. You know Audrey.

343
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,800
So can we please figure out what the hell is growing claws

344
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,700
and howling at the moon here in Haven? Do something to help her.

345
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,900
Victims aren't random.

346
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,100
Abby and jemma knew each other forever. They talked on the phone every day.

347
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,700
What about this other guy... Hank?

348
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,700
- How does... how does he fit in? 
- His birthday.

349
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,400
Jemma said her and Abby were best friends since the day they were born, right?

350
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,300
So I looked into it.

351
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,900
They were both born in Haven hospital on the same day... same day as Hank too.

352
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,600
- What day? 
- June 12, 1981.

353
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,000
June '81.

354
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,700
- When The Troubles started up last time. 
- Call Haven hospital.

355
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,300
See if anyone else was born on that day.

356
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,800
Hopefully we can get to them before our trouble person.

357
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,900
We just celebrated Jennifer's birthday... June 12th.

358
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,100
- Where is she? 
- Haven herald.

359
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,000
Let's go.

360
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,100
Jennifer!

361
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Jennifer!

362
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,400
Duke.

363
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,600
- duke,
- Would you stop saying my name and just help me?

364
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,200
Just calm down, okay? We've looked around.

365
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,100
There is no blood here, which means either...

366
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,300
Either Jennifer wasn't here, or she got away.

367
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,600
I found some more of that weird saliva stuff

368
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,200
Gloria collected from the other bodies, but no blood yet.

369
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,000
That thing... it hasn't taken any of its other targets.

370
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,300
It killed them right on the spot, so we got to believe that Jennifer's okay.

371
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,600
This is her phone.

372
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,300
- We have no way of contacting her now.
- We'll find her.

373
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,600
What if this thing is still after her?

374
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,300
We don't know anything about it, Nathan.

375
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,100
I think we need to reconsider our deal with The Darkside Seekers.

376
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,000
You made a deal with those little weasels?

377
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,600
No, not yet, but they have footage of this thing. Maybe it'll help us find it.

378
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,600
Or the Troubled person who's causing all of this.

379
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,900
You're only coming if you can keep it together.

380
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,800
If anything happens to her, I'm gonna kill somebody.

381
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,300
I'm just trying to figure out if this is intentional sabotage

382
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,500
or just sheer incompetence on your part,

383
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:35,400
but either way, you have ruined the best piece of supernatural footage we have ever shot.

384
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,300
Yeah, I feel like if I didn't have to cobble together all the equipment down in your basement,

385
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,100
- then maybe we wouldn't... 
- Oh, oh, really?

386
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,900
That's where we're gonna go?

387
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,500
- Sweet van, guys. 
- Great.

388
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,600
What, you didn't want to spring for the airbrushed unicorn?

389
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,100
Which one of you g. I. Joes gets to threaten us today?

390
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,300
- that would be me. 
- Actually, we're just here to talk about our deal.

391
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,800
Show us what you got.

392
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,100
If it helps with the investigation, then maybe we can schedule a ride-along.

393
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,700
There's something wrong with our footage.

394
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,200
It's corrupted. It looks... Like, grainy and pixilated. It looks fake.

395
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,800
You think we're gonna buy that?

396
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,300
Look, we all saw the creature.

397
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,900
Don't try to tell us it's not real.

398
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,600
Nobody's saying it's not real, all right?

399
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:20,800
It's real. It's just the footage that this genius shot... we go live with that,

400
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,500
we lose what little credibility we've got

401
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,600
Do I look like I care about your credibility?

402
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,900
Look, I'm just saying our monster looks like a million little black pixels, okay?

403
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,100
- It's just worthless footage.
 - Play it anyways.

404
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,600
Yeah, great. Show them. Take a look. Be my guest.

405
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,500
See, when you zoom in, it just looks like little black pixels,

406
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,900
like we just pasted the damn thing on there.

407
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,900
Give us a sec.

408
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,600
- Yeah. Take all day, guys. 
- Nice shot.

409
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,000
Those black orbs, whatever the hell they are..

410
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,800
that's what William used to turn us against each other.

411
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,800
And Audrey said William controls the orbs, been using them with Troubled people.

412
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,900
So William's behind this. He created that thing.

413
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,700
So there's no actual Troubled person.

414
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,400
But why is William after Jennifer and all those people born in '81?

415
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,300
- Let's go to the hospital and ask him. 
- He's still unconscious.

416
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,100
I guess I'm gonna have to wake him up long enough to beat some answers out of him.

417
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,400
You stick with them and see what else they got.

418
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,200
what

419
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,500
William... He's gone.

420
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,100
- I'm telling you, I feel fine. 
- That's impossible.

421
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,900
No, the doctor... he can't explain it either.

422
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,600
He says that all my internal stitches from the surgery are gone.

423
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,300
It's like I was never injured at all.

424
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,300
But if you're healed, does that mean...?

425
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,800
William is too.

426
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,100
Stan, how you doing?

427
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,000
It was time to change his I.V. Bag.

428
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,100
When I unlocked the door, these two guys kicked it open and knocked me out...

429
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,300
- Stan, don't... don't worry about it, okay?
-  I'm really sorry, guys.

430
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,200
There isn't anything you could've done.

431
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,300
The guys Stan saw...

432
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,900
one of them sounds a whole lot like your friend from the barn, the big one.

433
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,400
- He just carried William out? 
- One of the cops who got attacked outside...

434
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,100
he swears that William walked out of here on his own two feet,

435
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,300
healed, just like Audrey.

436
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,900
blocked

437
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,800
Hello?

438
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,900
Jennifer? Is that you? Jennifer, where are you?

439
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,700
- Duke? 
- Jennifer?

440
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,500
Duke, I left my cell at the herald.

441
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,000
Vince and I saw a monster.

442
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,500
- You're with Vince? 
- No, no

443
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,600
Vince went to the archives to see if he could figure out what this thing was,

444
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,300
but, Duke, it was huge, and the teeth... it was horrible.

445
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,400
- Jennifer... 
- I was just digging through some files like you asked me,

446
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,200
and then all of a sudden, it's like I knew something was coming for me,

447
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,800
like that "eerie eyes watching you from behind" feeling.

448
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:28,200
- And then there it was outside like it was sniffing me out.
-  Jennifer, where are you?

449
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,300
At an empty warehouse that Dave and Vince own at the end of canaan street.

450
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:35,700
Vince said that nobody knows about it and that I'd be safe here,
but why is that thing after me?

451
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,100
I want you to stay put. We'll be right there.

452
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,700
- Duke, I'm really scared. 
- I know. Just sit tight.

453
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,000
Tell her we need a description. Still Haven't got a good look at this thing.

454
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,000
Look, Jennifer, I want you to write down everything that you saw.

455
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,200
We're on our way.

456
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,200
Hey, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

457
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,700
Write it down, like I could ever scrub that image from my mind.

458
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,400
unstake my heart

459
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,400
gloria:rougarou not human.transdimensional trouble?
good luck!

460
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,600
All this, uh, jury-rigged equipment you haul around...

461
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,900
have you found anything in Haven with it?

462
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,000
Yeah, we've had a few beeps, but nothing I can officially confirm... why?

463
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,700
I have a friend who's in some danger, and we got nothing.

464
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,900
Do you have, uh, anything in here that can help me with this?

465
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,400
What is that?

466
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,300
It's fluid from the victim's blood, but first we run some tests.

467
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,300
And then we get the scoop?

468
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,200
Okay.

469
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,300
All right, fine.

470
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,600
Just give me a few moments to warm up the cells,

471
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,500
and you have got yourself a deal.

472
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,500
What's up with this obsession?

473
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,800
I mean, right now most people... they'd be running for the hills.

474
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,100
Well, to tell you the truth, it's not my first time in Haven.

475
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,900
I used to summer here with my family when I was a kid.

476
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,900
And you saw something?

477
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,000
It was summer, 1983.

478
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,500
We were all out at the beach.

479
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,700
I was playing down by the water with some local kid.

480
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:24,400
All of a sudden, this man just comes up out of the ocean.

481
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,900
He walks right towards us.

482
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,800
He grabs my friend, and then he just pulls him back out into the waves.

483
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,600
I was so scared, I- I couldn't even yell for help.

484
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,400
I sat there for an hour just staring out into the surf.

485
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,300
He never came back up.

486
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,200
Neither did the kid.

487
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,700
I should've done something.

488
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:56,900
Ever since then, I have spent my life trying to find something,

489
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,400
anything that might explain what I saw that summer.

490
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,800
And when I read that story about the heartless corpse,

491
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,100
I knew I had to come back out here.

492
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,000
I had to find the truth.

493
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,500
Well, saved by the bell.

494
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,600
All right, equipment's ready.

495
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,800
- you? 
- Sure.

496
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,800
Spectral imaging.

497
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
That is a no.

498
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,900
E.M.F. Gauge... Nada.

499
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,600
Geiger counter... Come on.

500
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,700
No, it's still nothing.

501
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,300
Damn.

502
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,500
All right, let's try something different.

503
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,100
I built this little baby myself.

504
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,700
I call it an electrical polarity guide, an e. P.G.

505
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:58,000
It's a modified cathode. It monitors inverse charges in the molecular field.

506
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,400
Let's see.

507
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,100
Show daddy what you can do.

508
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,000
I mean... I mean, look, it may not look like much, but I know what I'm doing... trust me.

509
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,400
Okay, so this thing can tell us when the rougarou is close?

510
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,100
Yeah, I guess so, theoretically.

511
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,700
I told you.

512
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,200
Duke?

513
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Okay, I'll be right there.

514
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,900
Okay, I need that machine.

515
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,600
Ahah, well, you know, this is a patent-protected device.

516
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Let's just go.

517
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,600
- Yeah? 
- Yeah.

518
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,700
I don't understand. What does William want with me?

519
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,800
June 12, 1981... is that your birthday, right?

520
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,100
William's been going after everyone born on that day.

521
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,400
That was the day The Troubles came back during the last cycle.

522
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,300
We know it has something to do with Jennifer's connection to the barn.

523
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,500
- Why'd you bring them? 
- No choice.

524
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,000
They got some gadget that can help us locate the rougarou.

525
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,300
- It measures the polarity of a... Something. 
- Yeah, thank you.

526
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,700
Basically this is a monitoring device that I built that, um...

527
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,500
Yeah, it's a box, tells you when the monster's close.

528
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:21,000
Turn it on, the gauge moves in this direction, then that means that...

529
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,400
It's close.

530
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,700
guys?

531
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,200
- No gun. - Sorry.

532
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:39,000
I don't think bullets would take this thing down anyway, not if William's behind it.

533
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,100
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

534
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,500
I... I lost the signal.

535
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,600
I don't know. Maybe it's moved on.

536
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Well, then what are we waiting for? Let's get out of here.

537
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,900
- Okay, it's making a different sound... why? 
- I don't know.

538
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,000
It's definitely not the rougarou.

539
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,900
Whatever this is, it's giving off the exact opposite reading.

540
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,000
- It's coming from you.
- What?

541
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,900
Are you serious? First some monster wants to eat my heart out,

542
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,400
- and now I'm some kind of paranormal phenomenon?
- Jennifer, where'd you get that book?

543
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,900
This was just in a box of old junk that my birth parents left behind.

544
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,500
No, that's not junk.

545
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,400
Seriously, I've read this, and it makes twilight look like faulkner.

546
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,600
No, I-I gave that to agent Howard before I came to Haven.

547
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,900
If you found that at your birth parents' house, that means...

548
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,600
Wait, he must have wanted her to find it.

549
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,900
That's not just some cheesy paperback.

550
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,000
It's something more.

551
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,500
Okay. Now what?

552
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,800
I don't want the magic beeping book.

553
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,500
- You should keep it. 
- Please, Jennifer.

554
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:01,100
Agent Howard is somehow linked to this barn and now this book and now you.

555
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,700
Guys, we should go.

556
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,600
So it's me and the book together. That's just perfect.

557
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,500
- Everyone stay together! 
- Again with the lights?

558
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,700
Anderson, give me that camera. Use the other one. You up?

559
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,700
- Yeah. 
- Keep rolling.

560
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,200
- Yeah, I'm rolling. 
- Keep rolling.

561
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,600
Heads up, heads up! Get Jennifer out of here!

562
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,200
- This way! 
- Over here.

563
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,600
- Oh, God. Is he okay? 
- Yeah, he's all right.

564
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,200
Anderson, go with them. I'll distract it.

565
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
- Go, go. 
- Over here!

566
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,100
- You sure?
- He's all right. He's just out cold.

567
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,000
It doesn't want him. It wants Jennifer.

568
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,000
Hey, you overgrown fur ball, over here!

569
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,900
Come on, we got to help Duke get it away from her.

570
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,400
Come on! Come on, come get me!

571
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,700
Listen, we're gonna get you out of here, okay?

572
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,400
Okay, yeah, you might, but that thing's trying to eat me!

573
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,700
No, we're not gonna let it.

574
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,900
See, there seems to be some kind of connection between you and the book.

575
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,800
Okay, maybe those readings... maybe they'll help us find a way to stop it.

576
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,300
Can we please talk a little quieter?

577
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,400
I can't run with a camera!

578
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,100
Come on! Come on!

579
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,300
Move, move! It's right behind me!

580
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,100
- Come on, let's go! 
- I'm coming!

581
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,100
 this way!

582
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,600
Come on, you son of a bitch!

583
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Come on! Wait, wait, where is he?

584
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,000
Seth, let's go. Move it.

585
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,700
Where... where is it? Where is the book?

586
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,200
- Oh, my God, I dropped it. 
- It's over there.

587
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,400
We need that book.

588
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,800
Okay.

589
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,700
Wait a minute.

590
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,500
You can do this.

591
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,800
Okay, all right.

592
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,600
- Hey, hey. 
- Jennifer!

593
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,400
Get back here. Get back here.

594
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Get the damn book!

595
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,400
- What just happened? 
- Where'd it go?

596
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,400
Jennifer!

597
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,300
Jennifer?

598
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,500
- Are you okay? 
- Yeah.

599
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:33,900
What?

600
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,500
How's Dwight? Is he gonna be okay?

601
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,900
Oh, so it's "Dwight" now? Not "Bigfoot"?

602
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,100
I'm serious. How is he?

603
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,900
Paramedics said he'll be fine.

604
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,600
It's just a mild concussion.

605
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,400
What the hell happened in there, huh?

606
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,100
Maybe the opposing frequencies created a compressed static field,

607
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,400
and... I don't know... poof maybe?

608
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,100
- I'm sure that's what happened. 
- Well, that's reassuring.

609
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,500
What you did in there for Jennifer, if you hadn't...

610
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,700
okay, let's not make a big deal out of this, detective.

611
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,700
I don't think I'm quite ready to start being praised by the men in black.

612
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,300
So where you off to next... loch ness, Atlantis?

613
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,400
Oh, come on, you don't really believe in that stuff, do you?

614
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,200
Don't encourage him, Nathan.

615
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,700
Between the footage they gathered and all the information Dwight so foolishly leaked,

616
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:46,500
- it'll take every trick we have in the book...
- okay, don't give yourself a heart attack there, cronkite.

617
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,300
We are not going to be releasing the footage, not ever.

618
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,400
Why not?

619
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,800
Well, even though you and your brother are sloppy, you're uncreative,

620
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:06,400
you have utterly laughable passwords, what you do for this town

621
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,100
is really important.

622
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,900
What all of you do is.

623
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,900
- These people... they didn't ask to be, you know... 
- Troubled.

624
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,900
Exactly.

625
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:23,600
They just are, and turning a group of innocent people

626
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:29,900
into a sideshow attraction, it's not exactly why I set out on this search.

627
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,800
I found out the truth.

628
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,500
That's enough.

629
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,100
Anyway...

630
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,500
Hey, your cameraman, Anderson... is he on board too?

631
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,800
Well, he's still trying to wrap his head around it,

632
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,800
but knowing him, yeah, he'll feel the same way.

633
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,400
Good luck.

634
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,400
Keep that luck for yourself. You're the one who's gonna need it.

635
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,500
So is this your first time destroying a supernatural monster with a magical book?

636
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,400
Yeah.

637
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,000
How do you feel about dating Hermione?

638
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,300
Well, you know, we all have our stuff.

639
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,600
I snore when I drink red wine.

640
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,400
Yes, you do, very loudly.

641
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,000
Very loudly.

642
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,400
How are you holding up?

643
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,200
All things considered, I'm fine, but, yeah, still confused.

644
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,200
This book... you guys seriously can't see the guard symbol?

645
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,600
It's orange. It's glowing.

646
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,400
How can you guys not see this?

647
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,400
It's meant just for you.

648
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,600
That's why even I can't see it.

649
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,700
- Maybe it's a message from agent Howard. 
- What does it mean?

650
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,000
Why is a guard symbol on the cover of that book?

651
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,800
Nathan...

652
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,800
You still feeling okay?

653
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,300
A couple hours ago, you had a hole right through you.

654
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,700
Physically I feel great.

655
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,300
But then again, that probably means William does too.

656
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:53,600
He killed innocent people and made it look like a trouble all just to get to Jennifer.

657
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,300
Hey, guys, come here.

658
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,900
I found something. I think it's like a riddle.

659
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,300
I just opened the book, and it started glowing.

660
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,100
"In times of great evil, the child of ruin

661
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,700
must find the heart of Haven and summon the door. "

662
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
Sounds like a creepy zeppelin lyric.

663
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,900
What's a child of ruin?

664
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,500
I think it's me.

665
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,400
That's why William wants you dead, because...

666
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,600
because I can summon the door.

667
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,000
And send William through it.

668
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,400
To where?

669
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,800
To wherever he came from.

670
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:41,100
