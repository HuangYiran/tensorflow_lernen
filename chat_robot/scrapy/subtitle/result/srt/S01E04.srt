1
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,010
情况如何 ?
How we doing?

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,012
我想我们能擦边过去
Okay Ltd. I think I've got it lined up pretty close.

3
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,013
不能靠得太近
No such thing as close.

4
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:15,598
- 要不就穿过去, 要不就是死
- 好吧
You thread the needle, or we're dead.
- Right.

5
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,391
就这么办吧, 照你说的做
It's ok, you can do it

6
00:00:17,391 --> 00:00:18,518
慢点, 别紧张
Nice and easy

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,686
Ok, 我想现在已经可以叫他们开门了
Ok, I think we're close enough to dial the gate

8
00:00:20,686 --> 00:00:23,606
太好了, 快点吧, 我想赶紧回去!
yes, yes, hurry up and get us back!

9
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,281
把这该死的东西拿掉!
Get this damn thing off me!

10
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:33,783
我们实在摘不下来
We can't.

11
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,285
那就切掉
Cut it off.

12
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:40,289
信号一接通赶紧告诉他们有人受伤了
As soon as we establish a connection,
radio back that we've got a medical emergency.

13
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:42,500
我们或许有什么办法帮她
There must be something we can do for him

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,795
去驾驶座旁边把急救箱拿来
There's a emergency first aid kit
behind the pilot seat, get it

15
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:50,466
少校, 我们试着取下这东西
你只会更疼
Major, everything we do try to remove
just make the pain not worth trying.

16
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,093
现在还不如尽量保持这样
Now try and be still

17
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,304
不能再快点了吗?
Is there no way to go faster?

18
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:57,598
他正在想办法让我们同时回去
He's just trying to get us back in one piece.

19
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,192
基地控制台, 我是Ford
Atlantis base, this is Ford.

20
00:01:08,192 --> 00:01:10,611
探险者1号准备着陆
我们这里有伤员
Jumper 1 is inbound with
a medical emergency

21
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:12,113
请回答
Please, respond

22
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:22,790
怎么了?
What's going on?

23
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,501
探险队说他们有人受伤了
The reconaissance team is reporting
a medical emergency.

24
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:27,920
我叫了Becket博士,
他正赶过来
I have alerted doctor Becket,
he's on his way.

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,297
叫Sheppard少校讲话
Put on major Sheppard.

26
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,798
就是他受伤了
He's the one who's injured.

27
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,389
真希望能找到什么东西把它除掉
How am I expected to find anything
that's gonna get rid of that thing.

28
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,599
能止疼就行!
Something for the pain!

29
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,601
我想外行干不了这个,
我们需要医生!
I don't think that the tylenol is gonna do it,
we need a doctor!

30
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,518
还要多久?
how much longer?

31
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:44,020
快了
Almost there.

32
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,731
基地, 探险者1号最后校对航道
Flight, Jumper one on final approach.

33
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,193
我是Weir, Sheppard少校的伤势怎么样了?
This is Weir, what's the nature of
Major Sheppard's injury?

34
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,112
几只外星虫子
附着在少校的脖子上了
Some sort of funky alien bug,
attached itself to his neck.

35
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:55,281
<i>他不能走动了</i>
<i>he's completely immobile</i>

36
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,490
那些虫子做了什么?
What is it doing to him?

37
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,492
<i>我们也不知道
我们那不下来,</i>
<i>We don't know but we can't get it off him,</i>

38
00:01:58,492 --> 00:02:00,786
<i>什么办法都试了就是不行</i>
<i>and we tried everything</i>

39
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:03,414
把那些东西带回飞船是很危险的
You understand the risk of bringing
something like that, back to Atlantis.

40
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,000
长官我知道. 但是我们没有别的办法
Yes, ma'am I do. But we really
don't have a choice in the matter

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,085
好吧, Lieutenant
我知道了
Understood Lieutenant.

42
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:09,587
祝你好运
Good luck.

43
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,090
对探险者进行隔离检查
Quarantine the jumper bay.

44
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,895
现在开始是自动导航了
It is all automatic from here.

45
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,396
我们到家了
Here we go.

46
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:53,940
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季 第4集
Season 1
Episode 4 : 38 minutes

47
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,210
他们呢?
Where are they?

48
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,085
我也不知道,
I don't know,

49
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:14,504
通道还敞开着
the gate's still active.

50
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,006
所有指示灯显示他们正在穿过通道
All indications read they should
be through by then.

51
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,740
晕 不是吧!
Oh no!

52
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,283
出什么事了?
What happened?

53
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:46,452
我们被卡在这了,
The drive pod,

54
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,788
当飞行的时候飞船的两翼是展开的,
我想刚刚没有完全收回
The wing things that stick out when we fly,
must have failed to retract.

55
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:50,206
我猜是这个原因
That's all I can think it could be.

56
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,084
应该是这个原因, 要不然就是通道关闭了,
我怀疑有这个可能
Of course that, or the Stargate's down,
which I highly doubt.

57
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,503
这回麻烦大了
But this is a big problem

58
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,963
我们怎么办?
What can we do?

59
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:58,297
我们没什么可做的了,
I don't think there's a thing we can do,

60
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:02,301
这回真他妈的麻烦大了
this is a-a very, very big problem.

61
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,931
帮个忙
Gimme a hand.

62
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,186
这他妈怎么回事?
What the hell was that?

63
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,397
太奇怪了
That's strange.

64
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:15,898
是啊
Yes it is.

65
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,567
这是...
That is the...

66
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,110
对, 没错
Yes it is.

67
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,613
有麻烦了
That's creepy sir.

68
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,781
我们被卡在这里了
We're stuck.

69
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:24,866
没错
Yes, we are.

70
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,201
显然机翼没有及时收回
Apparently the engine pods failed
to retract in time.

71
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,871
一头大一头小,
所以卡在门这了
Square peg, round hole.

72
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,163
我们能把Markham和Stackhouse拉出来吗?
Can we pull Markham and Stackhouse out?

73
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,709
一穿过这门我们的手臂马上消失
Our hands and arms would dematerialize
as soon as we crossed the event horizon.

74
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,419
没办法摸到他们
There's no way to reach for them.

75
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,382
少校
Major

76
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,594
他应该是在受撞击的时候晕过去了
He must have been knocked unconscious
by the impact

77
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,512
<i>探险者1号, 我是Weir</i>
<i>Jumper One, this is Weir</i>

78
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,138
<i>你们那里怎么样了?</i>
<i>What's your status?</i>

79
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,140
我是Ford, 能和你联系上太好了
This is Ford, good to hear your voice

80
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,058
我们有4个人还在这
但是...
The four of us are still here but...

81
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,104
<i>但是Markham和Stackhouse在里面</i>
<i>在通道里面</i>
<i>but Markham and Stackhouse are inside</i>
<i>the event horizon.</i>

82
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,064
再说一遍
Say again

83
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:01,110
长官, 探险者1号被卡在时空门了
Ma'am, Jumper one is lodged in the stargate.

84
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:05,114
Teyla, McKay博士, 我还有少校
在飞船后半截
Teyla, doctor McKay and myself
are in the rear compartment with the major.

85
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,616
少校情况不妙
He's in bad shape

86
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,286
Mark和Stockhouse在飞船前半截
Mark and Stockhouse are in the foward section

87
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,913
怎么会这样?
How did that happen?

88
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,164
机器卡住了
Engine pods

89
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,501
我们估计有一个推进器没有完全收回
We think, it was one of the engine pods

90
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,127
但是我们没法子确定
But there's no way to be sure

91
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,670
但那是唯一的可能性
It is the only viable possibility

92
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,965
如果我没听错的话
是不是你们的控制台没有了
If I understand you correctly,
you won't have acces of the flight controls

93
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,967
没错Elizabeth, 推测得很好
Yes Elizabeth, It's an extremely
intriguing conundrum,

94
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,261
而且我还有一件事想说,
and one that I would love
to discuss with you in detail,

95
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,680
当时空门关闭的时候飞船就两半了!
until the stargate shuts down and
the ship is cut in two!

96
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,307
Rodney, 冷静
Rodney!
Rodney, calm down.
Rodney!

97
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:35,603
我要赶紧想办法抓住你们的飞船
If I'm going to be any help to you at all,
I need to catch up.

98
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,396
让Ford和我说
Lt Ford, back it up for me.

99
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,736
我们在宇宙空间里无法识别幽灵的基地,
We couldn't ID the Wraith base of
operations from space,

100
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,446
就像上次我们到那一样
like we did the last time we were there.

101
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:49,492
我们着陆在附近为了看的更清楚些
So we went to the same landing co-ordinates
as before, to get a closer look.

102
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,182
没了
It's gone.

103
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:13,891
什么?
What?

104
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,810
那里应该是座山
This is in the mountain side.

105
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,186
原来是
It was.

106
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,688
我们曾经在那山里
We were inside it.

107
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,984
过去看看
Let's move.

108
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,088
就是以前那个地方
This was the spot.

109
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,007
这个坑比以前那座山还大
That's more a hole than a moutain really.

110
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,384
山被摧毁了?
Could have it been destroyed?

111
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,886
这肯定不是被炸的
This is definitely not a blaster.

112
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,220
嗯 不是
No.

113
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,598
我猜他们走了
I think they picked up and left.

114
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,807
以前是个飞船?
Was a ship?

115
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,685
我不理解, 长官, 整座山都被树覆盖着
I don't know, sir, the mountain was
covered of trees

116
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,396
没错, 但是幽灵冬眠几个世纪, 对吗?
Yeah, but the Wraith's hibernate for centuries, right?

117
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,399
所以有足够时间长出很多树
So a lot of tree's could have
overgrown in that time.

118
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,403
而我们被囚禁在其中一个大飞船里
就是我在图上给你指出来的那个
Then we were held prisoner inside one of
the great ships I showed you in the drawings.

119
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,698
他们走了, 开始屠戮整个世界
They've left, to begin culling worlds.

120
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,746
那边有动静
There's movement down there.

121
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:19,916
快跑!
Go!

122
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,010
她不会明白的
She hardly mean't, begin at the beginning.

123
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,012
这些事她应该知道
This is intel, she needs to know

124
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,889
我们现在还有不到38分钟
And we have less than 38 minutes

125
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,599
等会儿, 为什么只有38分钟?
Hold on, why 38 minutes?

126
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,520
因为在非活动状态下
时空门最多保持38分钟开启状态
Because that's the maximum amount of time a Stargate
remain open in non-relativistic conditions

127
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,105
这是热力物理学定义之一,
It is one of the more immutable laws
of the worm holes physics,

128
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,817
而且天啊, 看看表,
最多还有35分钟. 你吸住我们的飞船了吗?
and oh my, look at the time,
it's more like 35 minutes. Are we all caught up?

129
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,902
我知道了
I get it

130
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,819
你需要什么?
What do you need?

131
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:49,779
帮忙
Help

132
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,613
好啦!
All right!

133
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:54,617
叫Cavenaugh, Groden和Simpson来这里
看看他们有什么主意
Let me put Cavenaugh, Groden and Simpson in a room.
See what they come up with.

134
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,245
很好, Czech, Czech,
别忘了叫Czech
That's good, and the Czech, Czech,
the Czech with name i cant remember

135
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,120
Zelenka博士?
Doctor Zelenka?

136
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,580
就是他们. 这是我们一起研究的
That's it. We'll work it at our end.

137
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,373
还有谁?
What else?

138
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,083
我们再联系, 谢了
We call you, thank you

139
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,629
病人在哪?
Where is my patient?

140
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,089
-有点麻烦. 去会议室
-哦, 不是吧...
-There's been a problem. Conference room.
-Oh, no...

141
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,007
保持和他们联系
Keep a channel open with them all the times

142
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,592
把报警器关了!
And turn that alarm off!

143
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,483
Hi Teyla!
Hi Teyla!

144
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,573
你没事吧?
Are you allright?

145
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,491
我没事
I am fine

146
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,996
看起来我们还没回基地
Something tells me, we haven't
made it to Atlantis yet.

147
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:40,997
没有
No

148
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,298
Ford?
Ford?

149
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,220
那是什么玩意儿?
What is that?

150
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,305
长官, 我们卡住了
We stucks, Sir

151
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,514
我们在哪?
We're what?

152
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,224
在时空门中间
In a gate

153
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,227
也就是说我们快玩儿完了
You mean my day just got worse.

154
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,693
据我们推测
应该有1,2个推进器没有收回
We're going with the assumption,
that it was one or both of the drive pods.

155
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,986
我不知道是不是机器出了故障
I don't know if it was mechanical failure.

156
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,071
要不就是当咱们起飞的时候机器被击中了
Or was damaged as we try to take off.

157
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,787
不要停
Taking fire.

158
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,457
要不我们就完蛋了!
It's a melt to do!

159
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,666
我在劲力!
I try Sir!

160
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,087
没有办法证实
Is no way of knowing, really

161
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:34,091
但是如果有懂一些机械常识 ...
But, if you know some way of mannually
crack the mechanism ...

162
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,219
Cokpit跟过来了
Cokpit on their left

163
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,430
cokpit在那个时候分子化了,
但是...
the cokpit is regretably demolecularize,
at the moment, but...

164
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,890
你发现什么了吗?
Loose someone back here?

165
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,602
- 没有
- 应该没有
- No
- No, I dont think so

166
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:48,397
如果你不介意, 我在这里读点东西
Well if you'll excuse me, I'll be a foot and a half
over there, taking some readings.

167
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,191
你们慢慢聊吧
Feel free to talk amongst yourselves.

168
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,581
你们了解大致情况了吧
我们还有不到半个小时
Alright, you've all been briefed.
We have less than half an hour.

169
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,582
Zelenka博士呢?
Where this doctor Zelenka?

170
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,668
他在做2号小型模拟飞机
He's working up a simulation
in the Puddle-Jumper Two

171
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,294
- 那个模拟机可以直接到找到他们
- 太好了
- It was direct toward there
- That is good

172
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,963
前提是要有足够的时间
If there was time it would be

173
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,506
博士, 现在不是讨论它的功能的时候
It is not a matter that features yet, doctor.

174
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,383
飞船上有6个人
There's 6 people on a ship

175
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,886
我只是个医疗博士,
所以请原谅我问一个愚蠢的问题
I'm just a medical doctor here,
so forgive me if this is a stupid question

176
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,097
如果他们走进时空门
If they just step to the event horizon

177
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,516
当门关闭的时候,
他们不能回到飞船控制台吗?
wouldn't they come through to the front
part of the ship, when the gate shuts down?

178
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,810
飞船前面一段不能被重组
The front half won't rematerialise on this side.

179
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,604
时空门只能传送完整物体
The Stargate transmits the matter in discreet units

180
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,190
飞船前面一段不能被重组,
The front half of the ship cannot rematerialise,

181
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,110
除非整个飞船都通过时空门
Until the whole ship has crossed
into the event horizon

182
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,821
时空门只能接受没有中断的介质
The Stargate is a century waiting for
the contiguous components

183
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,781
也就是说飞船和里面所有的东西
Meaning the jumper and everyone inside

184
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,284
在我们传送他们之前,
必须都通过了时空门
To enter completely,
before we can transport them

185
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,204
他的意思是说时空门只能传送一阵个物体
He say's, the gate only sends
things through in one piece.

186
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,080
我听明白了
Yeah, sorry

187
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,792
很不幸, 直到分子重组完成之前
Unfortunately, the upgoing Stargate
won't transmit the matter stream

188
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,211
上传的时空门是不会传送任何流状介质的
until the demolecularization is completed

189
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,504
当门关闭的时候
When he shuts down

190
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,508
整个飞船前身, 还有里面所有的人都会消失
entire forward section, along with
the men inside will cease to exist

191
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,010
其他人呢?
And what about the others?

192
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,305
飞船会在瞬间沿着时空门被切割
The ship will be severed instantaneously
along the event horizon

193
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,807
他们将被抛向真空宇宙,
They'll be exposed to hard vacuum,

194
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,309
现在还有29分钟
In 29 minutes

195
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,480
他们如果关闭后舱门呢?
What if they close the bulkhead door?

196
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,902
整个飞船后部会是密闭的,
起到了一个救生艇的作用
The rear portion of the ship,
will remain pressurised. Become a sort of lifeboat.

197
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,403
他们很快就没有氧气了
It will lose atmosphere very quickly

198
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,405
那么我们就有时间派另一个飞船去接他们了
It could buy enough time to send
a second Jumper.

199
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,114
那又怎么样?
And do what?

200
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:20,990
有办法了!
Figure it out!

201
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,492
和探险者1号取得联系
告诉他们这个建议
Contact Jumper One and made recommendation

202
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,388
你干什么?
What are you doing?

203
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,098
对不起
Sorry, here

204
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,684
探险者1号, 我是基地
Jumper One, this is Atlantis

205
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,602
我听到了
We're still here.

206
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,521
<i>我们建议你们关闭后舱门</i>
<i>We recommend closing the bulkhead door.</i>

207
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,481
哦... 好主意
Oh... Good thinking

208
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,899
然后呢?
What else?

209
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,610
我们还在想办法
再和你联系
We are still working on the problem.
We'll get back to you.

210
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:58,819
完毕
Atlantis base out.

211
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,321
谢谢你和我们联系!
Thanks for calling!

212
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,493
除了我还有人怕黑吗?
Somebody else is claustrophobic
or is it just me?

213
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,702
为什么关闭舱门?
Why did you close the doors?

214
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,788
当时空门关闭,
飞船前部被割断的时候,
So that when the Stargate is close down,
and the forward section is severed,

215
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,706
我们就不会被抛向外太空了
we're not directly exposed to space

216
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,499
这门结实吗?
Will it hold?

217
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,876
用潜水艇材质做的,
我想可以...
Like a screen door in a submarine,
I just prefer apoxia...

218
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:14,919
...起到减压的作用
...to decompression.

219
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,420
这... 这只是个人想法
It is... it is a personal thing

220
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,548
快没空气了
我看你还是冷静点吧
The air's gonna get thin in here.
Your really do have to calm down.

221
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,216
- 哦, 如果不这么做27分钟以后你就知道什么是缺氧了
- McKay
- Oh, you wait and see how thin it get's in 27 minutes.
- McKay

222
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,301
真空的宇宙. 那才叫缺氧
Vacuum. That's thin.

223
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,302
把门打开
Knock it off

224
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,389
哦, 我觉得只有我认识到了我们现在处境多危险!
Oh, I apologise for being the only person
who truly comprehends how screwed we are!

225
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,392
别和我谈危险!
Don't talk to me about screwed!

226
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,278
我们不应该放弃Markham和Stackhouse
And let's not give up on
Markham and Stackhouse, either.

227
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,698
我们还有很多时间想办法,
There's plenty of time to solve this thing,

228
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,702
首先你最好闭上嘴,
好好动动脑子
but you've gotta stop using your mouth,
and start using your brain.

229
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,207
对不起...我只是...
I'm sorry...I'm just...

230
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,211
这是人到生死关头的正常反映
我知道这样不对..
I react to certain doom, in a certain way.
It's a bad habit and..

231
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,089
也许有办法手动让推进器收回
Maybe there is a way to manually
retract the mechanism.

232
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,591
我想应该可以
Yeah maybe there is.

233
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,098
给你这个
Here

234
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,020
你很坚强
You seem stronger

235
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,314
不. 只是现在不那么疼了
No.it's just the pains not so bad now.

236
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,315
很好
That's good

237
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,900
不, 我不觉得
No, It isn't

238
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,401
因为我的腿没知觉了
I can't feel my legs

239
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,487
手和胳膊都是麻的
The hands and the arms are numb

240
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,281
我基本不能动了
I can barely move them.

241
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,117
我快失去知觉了. 少尉
feelings creeping me out. Look lieutenant

242
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,120
我只想告诉你
What I'm trying to say

243
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,623
如果我不能把这东西取下去
is if you don't get this damn thing off me.

244
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,001
我会比你先死
I have even less time than you do.

245
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,730
Zelenka博士
Doctor Zelenka

246
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,609
对不起我没有参加会议,
Weir博士, 我实在没有时间
Apologise to not attending a breefing,
Dr Weir, there was not time.

247
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,694
我不想妨碍你
但是我想知道你在做什么
I don't want to slow you down but
I need to know what you're working on

248
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,738
这样我可以告诉探险者1号
so I can communicate it to the team
on Jumper one.

249
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,616
我们正在努力 ...
We are attempting to retract the ...

250
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:14,080
把推进器收回到飞船后舱
the drive pod back into the fuse lodge
from inside the rear compartment

251
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,206
有什么进展了吗?
Anything yet?

252
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,583
远古科技很复杂
There is much redundancy
in the ancient technology.

253
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,920
所以我先在这里做个试验
Making it dangerous for them
to experiment with it in this way.

254
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,090
也就是说飞船后门有可能打开
他们就被抛向外太空
So they might accidentally open the rear
hatch or shut life support off entirely.

255
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,591
是的, 是的, 没错
Yes, yes, yes

256
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:29,595
这就是为什么我要先做个试验
It's just why we're attempting to isolate
the correct control pathway.

257
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,597
明白了. 我有什么能帮上忙的?
Understood. What can I do to help?

258
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,975
别和我聊天就行了
Stop talking, please.

259
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,401
少尉,
Lieutenant,

260
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,028
拿刀把这东西切开
get your knife out and cut this damn thing off.

261
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,072
这回他不能在怎么伤到我了
It can't hurt as much as it did last time.

262
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,991
上次你差点死了
The last time, we almost lost you

263
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,784
算了, 我怎么样都会死的
Ah well.you're going to lose me anyway

264
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,994
长官
Sir

265
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,913
我们回到飞船上的时候已经试过切掉它了
We tried to cut it off when
we were back on the planet

266
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,082
各种方法都试了
We tried everything

267
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,584
长官你能坚持吧?
You're right sir?

268
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,004
准备好了
Here we go.

269
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,097
任何办法只会让能更难受
Everything we did just seemed to hurt you more.

270
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,974
我想它可以自我治疗
I think it just heals itself.

271
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,394
它吸收你的能量, 就像那些幽灵
it feeds on your strengh, like the Wraith

272
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,396
你和我说过了
You had to say that.

273
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,858
我父亲给我讲过许多关于这种生物的故事
My father often told stories about
creatures such like this.

274
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,904
我一直以为他想让我们这些孩子呆在营地
I always thought he was just trying to keep
the children from straying far from our camp.

275
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,407
很好, 他告诉过你怎么杀了他们吗?
Great, and did he
tell you how to kill it?

276
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,409
我不知道,
我确信我们杀不了它
I don't know sir,
I'm sure we can't.

277
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,703
我想到了另一个办法
I could use a second opinion

278
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,496
和基地取得联系
Get back on the radio

279
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,292
收到
Affirmative

280
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,377
过来吧长官, 接通了
Come here Sir, this micro is open.

281
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,089
我是Beckett医生, 伤员怎么样?
This is doctor Beckett, how is our patient?

282
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,384
<i>我是Ford. Sheppard少校苏醒了</i>
<i>但是那个生物还在他身上</i>
<i>This if ford. Major Sheppard is conscious</i>
<i>but the creature is still latched on to him.</i>

283
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,595
大夫能不能来就诊啊?
How do you feel about house calls doc?

284
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:56,390
我也想
但是你实在太远了
Would if I could major Sheppard but
you'll have to settle for long distance.

285
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,809
我听说有东西附在你身上了
I'm told you have something of a cling-on

286
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,981
很可笑吧
It's funny

287
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,109
是你见过最丑陋的东西了
It's like the ugliest damn thing you've ever seen.

288
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,403
它怎么攻击到你的?
How did it attack yourself ?

289
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,489
我们在回飞船的路上
Well, we returned toward the Jumper

290
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,492
幽灵们向我们开枪
The Wraith were shooting us

291
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,913
我掩护你
你去告诉Marco准备起飞
Go tell Marco to get ready for
take off I'll cover you.

292
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:19,580
你怎么办?
What about you?

293
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,374
我这就回去, 快走!
I'll be there in a minute, GO!

294
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,199
<i>少校回飞船的路被截住了</i>
<i>Major we're cut off from the jumper</i>

295
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:56,909
不行
Negative

296
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,412
有一个在你3点钟位置
另外两个被我引过来了
They're should be one at your three o'clock
I drew the other two this way

297
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,414
<i>我们被包围了
他们从哪出来的?</i>
<i>They're all around us where'd they come from?</i>

298
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,083
少尉你应该知道他们能够隐身的,
Ltd you know how they can make you
see things that aren't there,

299
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,086
你前面现在没有人, 赶紧跑!
The path in front of you is cleared, now move!

300
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,303
你能描述一下吗?
Can you describe it to me?

301
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,387
好的
Yes sir.

302
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:20,391
包括尾巴它一共2英尺长,
还有点什么东西在他胳膊下面
It's about two feet in length including the tail,
there's rough stuff under his arm picks

303
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:24,687
有两个带刺的东西在少校脖子上
靠近颈动脉
It's got two sharp spiny things in his neck
near the Major's carotid artery

304
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,189
描述的再细致点
I need more than that, son

305
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,192
4条像腿的东西
Four legs, if you can call them that

306
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:32,486
紧紧的包住了少校的喉咙
They're wrapped around the Major's throat.

307
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,488
找不到眼睛
I can't see any eyes

308
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:39,202
有很坚硬的外壳, 但是肚子下面很松软
It's got a real hard shell, but there's
a soft meaty part underneath.

309
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,787
少校, 你有什么感觉?
Major, what are your physical symptoms?

310
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,290
就好像用刀刺我的眼
Well, first it was as a knife in the eye

311
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,502
因为我现在没有什么知觉了
Since I have lost all the feelings
in my extremities

312
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,212
我不能动
I can't move

313
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:53,216
这么说初期感到疼痛
So it incapacitates first with pain and prophases.

314
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,719
我想去帮McKay检查机器故障
I need to be able to move around
and help McKay with mechanical problem.

315
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:00,097
如果不想办法
Marco和Stackhouse会死的
Marco and Stackhouse are dead if I don't.

316
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,516
你们都试过什么办法了?
What have you tryed?

317
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:05,019
试过用刀切, 用火烧,
我甚至用枪打它
I've tried to cut it off, I've tried to burn it off,
I've even tried to shoot it off.

318
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,396
很近的点射
9 mil point blank.

319
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,982
除了差点杀了少校以外,
没有任何效果
Not much worse I can do without
killing the Major along with it.

320
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,319
我相信这个生物属于那些幽灵
I believe the creature is related
in some way to the Wraith

321
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:13,986
真的?
really ?

322
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:14,820
为什么这么说?
How so?

323
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,783
它不断吸Sheppard少校的血来维持生命
it feeds itself after each intent to remove him
by sucking life from Major Sheppard

324
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,910
和那些幽灵一样
Just as the Wraith would.

325
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,788
我估计是幽灵放出了什么东西
Well, I suppose the Wraith has
to have evolved of something

326
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,582
我估计是一种...
史前的某种东西
I suppose that it is a sort of a...
prehistoric cousin.

327
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,920
大夫听着, 少校不能这样下去
Listen Doctor, the Major can't be worse

328
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,713
我们要想点办法
We gonna do something right now

329
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,718
你刚刚说这个生物的腹部很软而且他还吸血
You said that the creature had a underside
an exposed  soft tissue like a leech

330
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,595
我试过把它割开
I tried to cut into it.

331
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,514
那东西差点杀死少校
the thing practically strangled him to death

332
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,518
你不要切掉它
在它身上洒点盐
Son you don't cut leeches off.
You pour salt on to them.

333
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,312
如果你启动磁场他们都会死
If you activate the field they'll die.

334
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,565
如果他们解决了这个问题
我们可以一起打开磁场
We can always open it together
if they fix the problem

335
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,607
他们没有时间了
Well they may not have time.

336
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,693
如果不这么做他们会毁掉这个设备
If they don't, we could destroy this facility.

337
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,487
我是想让你们想个解决方法
It's supposed we're working on solutions.

338
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:03,202
我们估计飞船一开始就损坏了
We think the Jumper must be damaged
for this to have happened in the first place.

339
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,581
把远古系统提速是个驾驶错误
Ancient systems are too advanced
for this to be pilot error.

340
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:07,290
那么怎么样?
So ?

341
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,791
那么就取决于损坏程度有多大
So depending on the extend of the damage

342
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,919
我们不能保证因此而产生的能量不反馈到别的地方
we can't rule out a catastrophic power
feed back in the drive manifolds.

343
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,212
请不要用术语
Without the techno babble please.

344
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:16,174
Cavenaugh博士, 只是想说,
有一点可能性,
Doctor Cavenaugh, was pointing out,
that there's a very slim chance,

345
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,135
飞船没有控制台,
推进器又受损,
that with the cockpit controls interrupted,
and with the pod damaged,

346
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,262
飞船有可能超载
the main drive could overload.

347
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,097
她的意思是爆炸
She means to say explode.

348
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:27,310
特别是当McKay开始检查线路,
Especially if McKay starts nosing around
inside the control conduits,

349
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,936
尝试整修推进器的时候
to attract the drive pod manually.

350
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,230
他肯定会的. 我知道我会这么做
And he will. I know I would.

351
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:34,233
Zelenka正在想办法
我刚刚从那里回来
Zelenka's working on simulations.
I just came from there.

352
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,360
如果超负荷
If there is a catastrophic overload.

353
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,322
爆炸会毁掉整个飞船,
The full force of the explosion
will break up the Jumper,

354
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,783
碎片会顺着时空门飞进来
就像个炸弹
follow the burning fragments through
the Stargate, like a bomb.

355
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:49,165
你们认为这种危险性很小么?
You think the risk of
this happening is minimal?

356
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,085
我觉得很小
In my opinion. Yes.

357
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,298
你们都同意?
You all agree?

358
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,676
那么就试试吧
Then we take the chance.

359
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,098
我认为说清楚这种危险性很重要
I thought it was important
to point out the risk.

360
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,517
没错, 你说清楚了
Fine, you did.

361
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:13,231
现在请多想想他们的生命,
不要总想着你自己....
Now please worry a little bit more about
their  lives, and less about your own ass....

362
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,486
还有23分钟
23 minutes.

363
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,076
Weir博士?
Doctor Weir?

364
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,369
对不起, 我现在没有时间
I'm sorry, I don't have time right now.

365
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,038
这些人不是想拿回这艘飞船
Neither do those people that are trapped
aboard the ship of the ancestors.

366
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,332
消息传得真快
News travels fast.

367
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,502
当你们探险队员呼救的时候
我和她谈了
I was speaking with one of your expedition
members, when she was called in to help.

368
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,171
好吧, 我应该知道我们没有时间了
Well then, you are aware that
we are very short on time.

369
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,006
我知道
I am.

370
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,009
但还是很重要
Still, this is important.

371
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,554
好吧
Ok

372
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,849
你不知道一件事
但是在我们中间,
You do not know this.
But among our people,

373
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:52,478
有一个仪式祷告者刚刚说
死亡临近他们了
there is a ritual prayer that is said,
when one knows that death is upon them.

374
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:53,813
我们不这么认为
We don't know that it is.

375
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,273
有人告诉我这是不可避免的
I'm told that it is all but inevitable.

376
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:56,107
谁说的?
By who?

377
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:57,817
那不重要
It is not important.

378
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,445
重要的是, Teyla已经准备好死了
What is important, is that Teyla
be allowed to prepare for death.

379
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:07,034
要知道一个人死亡的时间和地点,
对于我们来说是很珍贵的
Knowing the time and place of one's end,
is a very rare thing among our people.

380
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:10,746
只是个简单的仪式, 只需要一点时间....
It is a simple rite, but will not take more
than a few moments to....

381
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,877
Hollan? 我们要劲我们全力来就他们
Hollan? We need to concentrate all of
our efforts on saving them.

382
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,045
此时此刻Teyla自己的信念是什么?
At the risk of forsaking Teyla's own beliefs?

383
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:21,716
重要的是我们要用我们现有很少的时间
尽我们最大的努力....
It is important that we use what
little time we have, to try everything....

384
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,635
这件事上,
不用你告诉我什么重要什么不重要
I would ask you not to tell me what is important,
and what is not, in this case.

385
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:28,139
- 对不起, 现在我没有时间聊天
- 为什么不行?
- I'm sorry, I can't have this conversation right now.
- Why not?

386
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:29,807
因为我们在浪费时间
Because we are wasting time.

387
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:31,517
这一时刻Teyla早就准备好了
This is time that Teyla can use to prepare.

388
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,895
好了, 你认为死亡是必然的
Alright, you perceive death
a certain way.

389
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,647
我也承认. I事实上, 我也尊重你们的想法
I accept that. In fact, I respect that.

390
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:41,652
但是我们没有准备去死
我们必须尽力去避免死亡
But we do not prepare for death.
We do everything we can to stave it off.

391
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,987
这才是我们应该做的
That is who we are.

392
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,114
我并不想中止你的工作
I'm not asking you to suspend your efforts.

393
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:48,034
你想让我告诉这飞船上所有人,
No. You want me to tell
everyone on that ship,

394
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,535
他们最好还是安心等死?
that they should expect to die?

395
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,913
我不会说的
I will not send them that message.

396
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:57,001
并且如果你觉得这样侵犯了Teyla的权利,
我向你道歉
And if you feel that, that violates
Teyla's rights, I apologise.

397
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:01,839
我会道歉的. 但是现在不是时候
我必须走了
I truly do. But there's nothing I can do
about that right now. I have to go.

398
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:19,106
<i>很好. 现在我们手头上</i>
<i>有了所有探险者1号人员名单</i>
<i>Alright. We've got everything to</i>
<i>the Jumper manifest, already laid out here.</i>

399
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,900
<i>你那里有什么可以利用的工具</i>
<i>What's your personal inventory.</i>

400
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:24,362
我这有把瑞士军刀
Alright, from the vest,
we got a swiss army knife.

401
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:30,451
一些巧克力, 还有点水
火柴, 急救包
Some chocolate, some water.
Matches, emergency kit.

402
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:34,914
还有些酒精, 碘酒, 止疼片
We have alcohol, iodine, pain killers

403
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,165
这是什么?
What is this?

404
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,627
Teyla在飞船储藏室找到一个心脏起搏器
Teyla found a portable difibrillator
in the ships storage.

405
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:43,256
我在想. 如果Sheppard少校被电击,
那生物有可能杀了他
I thought of that. If Major Sheppard received
the same electric shock, it would likely kill him.

406
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,173
没错
Right

407
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,342
什么都试试. 每次试一样
Try everything. One item at a time.

408
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:54,433
Weir博士!
Dr Weir!

409
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,727
Cavenaugh, 你是不是有什么新发现
Cavenaugh, I hope you've got
something to tell me.

410
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,062
是的
Yes, I do.

411
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,314
他妈的怎么回事?
What the hell was that?

412
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,024
你说什么?
Excuse me?

413
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:06,362
我很高兴离开SGC, 因为我,
因为我可以参军了,
I happily left the SGC, because I had,
had it up to here, with the military running things,

414
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,406
你却不让我参与秘密研究
and you just busted me like a private.

415
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,659
别总胡思乱想, 这没什么秘密
Don't be so dramatic, besides
the Air Force doesn't have privates.

416
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:16,956
不止是我. 你撤掉了我整个研究小组的职务
Neither do I. You just cut them off.
Right in front of my research team.

417
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,000
就为了这事? 你有什么不满吗?
That's what this is about? You're embarrassed?

418
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,960
我承认确实有点丢人
Well humiliated would be a little more accurate.

419
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,254
我顾及不到任何人的颜面
I haven't worked up to humiliation yet.

420
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:28,384
我只是做了个假设,
只是做了一个普通市民应该做的
I just assumed, that with a civilian in charge of
the expedition, there would be a little bit more.

421
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,929
我们已经不再是一个市民,
我们和地球隔绝了
A civilian is in charge,
and we are cut off from Earth.

422
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,599
整个基地就好像一个大移民
Which makes Atlantis,
almost like a colony.

423
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:35,766
我明白这点
I suppose.

424
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,518
那好,
我是这里的主管
Well I'm governor of that colony.

425
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,020
说得真好
Well that's all very well and good.

426
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,688
你有什么异议吗?
Do you have a problem with that?

427
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:42,732
你没明白我的意思
You're missing my point.

428
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,275
不是, 是你没明白我的意思
No, you're missing mine.

429
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,320
如果你再因为你的自私
If you waste one more minute,
which could be used

430
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:51,485
浪费救出他们的宝贵的每1分钟,
to help the people trapped
on that ship, because of your ego?

431
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,869
我保证我会把你送到一个孤星上,
I promise you, I will dial the co-ordinates
of a very lonely planet,

432
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:57,496
在那里你永远是最主要的
where you can be as self important
as you wanna be.

433
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,210
你认为我在开玩笑?
You think I'm kidding?

434
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:04,795
你不会这么做的
You wouldn't do that.

435
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:08,132
Cavenaugh? 回去工作
Cavenaugh? Get back in there.

436
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,552
这件事我们以后再谈
We'll talk about this later.

437
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,514
没有下一次了. 滚!
Never again. Go!

438
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:17,725
滚!
Go!

439
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:41,347
Zalinka博士, 请接控制室
Dr Zalinka to control room.

440
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,934
我有新发现了
I think I have something

441
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,855
我们在接受信号
We're receiving.

442
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:51,983
探险者1号, 我是Weir
Jumper One, this is Weir.

443
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,860
Zelenka博士有新发现
Doctor Zelenka's come up with something.

444
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,570
Zelenka. 为什么我总忘不掉你?
Zelenka. Why can I never
remember that name?

445
00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:59,616
<i>他已经找到了</i>
<i>飞船推进器的主控系统</i>
<i>He's positively identified the control systems in the</i>
<i> port side of the Jumper, that retract the drive pod.</i>

446
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:01,701
我正在用同样方法控制你的系统
I'm relaying the schematics to your data pad.

447
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,912
太好了, 我们有救了
Thank you, now we're getting somewhere.

448
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:04,579
什么?
What?

449
00:26:04,662 --> 00:26:07,081
Zelenka找出了推进器的控制系统
Zelenka's identified the control pathways
to the engine pod,

450
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:11,753
也就是说现在修好机器的比率从万分之一
上升到了千分之一
which means that's increasing my chances of fixing this,
from one in a million, to one in a thousand.

451
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:16,132
但是, 有件事. Elizabeth
But, it's something. Elizabeth.

452
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:17,008
什么事?
Yes?

453
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:21,846
如果机器超负荷我只有7-9秒通知你,
I'll only have 7 to 9 seconds to warn you if I
accidentally do a catastrophic overload,

454
00:26:21,888 --> 00:26:25,600
所以我让你开启防御系统的时候
你不要犹豫
so if I tell you to raise the shields.
Don't hesitate.

455
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:29,270
我们知道危险性
你尽力吧
We're aware of the risk Rodney.
Do your best.

456
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,699
先试试碘酒
Starting with iodine.

457
00:26:58,842 --> 00:27:00,134
碘酒被吸收了
Scratch iodine.

458
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:01,886
你那还有什么?
What else have you got there?

459
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:04,347
对啊, 你还有什么? 有什么吃的吗?
Yes, what have you got there? Any food?

460
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,348
你开玩笑
You're kidding.

461
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:09,686
我只有不到20分钟来救咱们 ,
而我现在都快低血糖了, 所以....
I have less than 20 minutes to save our lives,
and I am teetering on the brink of a
hypoglycemic reaction, so....

462
00:27:12,605 --> 00:27:13,606
谢谢
Thank you

463
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:26,035
我现在试酒精
I'm gonna try alcohol now.

464
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:28,705
放一点到它的肚皮上,
看看有神么反映
Place a few drops on the soft tissue,
to see how it reacts.

465
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:30,665
给我留点
Save some for me.

466
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:32,750
这酒精不能喝
Wrong type of alcohol sir.

467
00:27:33,209 --> 00:27:34,377
这种有什么好处?
What's the good of that?

468
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:41,134
没什么
Not much sir.

469
00:27:43,636 --> 00:27:45,138
还是没有反映
No reaction to alcohol.

470
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,515
好吧, 下一个是什么?
Right, What next?

471
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:52,228
医生没说洒点盐在这生物上吗?
Did the Doctor not say to pour salt
on the creature?

472
00:27:52,562 --> 00:27:57,150
我想这不用说. 你就试试所有的东西吧
I think that was a metaphor. But it doesn't matter.
Just try everything.

473
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,801
水. 给我点水
Water. Give me water.

474
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,531
长官.长官.你没事吧. 长官? 少校?
Sir.Sir.Sir are you alright. Sir? Major?

475
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,120
你没事吧. 长官? 少校?
Sir are you alright? Sir? Major?

476
00:28:51,621 --> 00:28:53,331
少校怎么了?
Major What's happening?

477
00:29:02,382 --> 00:29:04,050
到底怎么了
What's happening

478
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:18,898
那东西对水或者是盐产生了反映
It reacted to either the salt or the water.

479
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,275
或者是两个一起的反映
Or a combination of both.

480
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,901
它掉下来了吗?
Did it lose it's hold on Major Sheppard?

481
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:22,610
没有
Negative

482
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:24,154
它抓得更紧了
If anything, it dug in more.

483
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:25,864
别试了
Please don't do that again.

484
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,031
我不会了, 对不起长官
I won't sir, sorry.

485
00:29:27,157 --> 00:29:30,076
好像它对盐水有种抵抗
Looks like they have a primitive
defence to salt water.

486
00:29:30,994 --> 00:29:34,372
它动了
当你把他推向电路板的时候,
It moved.
When you threw him across the circuits,

487
00:29:34,455 --> 00:29:36,624
我感到引擎启动了一下,
但是很快又停了
I think the engine fired for a microsecond,
but it stopped.

488
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,379
哦 不是吧
Oh no.

489
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:42,630
怎么了?
What?

490
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:45,633
怎么了?
What?

491
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:49,345
可以实行A计划了
So much for plan A.

492
00:29:49,512 --> 00:29:50,847
怎么了?
What?

493
00:29:52,765 --> 00:29:54,601
当时空门关闭的时候
When the Stargate closes now,

494
00:29:54,642 --> 00:30:00,023
这里所有的分子的运动,
都会导致这里的冲击
every molecule of air in this compartment,
is gonna out rush out through there.

495
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:03,443
我们向前滑动了一点
We slid in further.

496
00:30:09,365 --> 00:30:11,075
还有15分钟
15 minutes.

497
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:20,960
Ford, 你那里怎么样了?
Ford, what can you tell me?

498
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:23,046
<i>我们的飞船移动了一点</i>
<i>The Puddle Jumper has shifted slightly.</i>

499
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:25,840
现在飞船后端暴露在时空门前面了
The rear compartment has now
breached the event horizon.

500
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:29,260
McKay博士
Dr McKay.

501
00:30:32,138 --> 00:30:35,141
McKay博士, 还是希望我们能及时收回推进器
Dr McKay, is still hopeful we can retract
the drive pod in time.

502
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:44,901
明白了
Understood.

503
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:49,989
我们现在没有任何新进展
但是时间不多了
We haven't come up with anything yet.
But there's still time.

504
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,783
明白
Yes ma'am.

505
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:53,910
Sheppard少校怎么样了?
How is Major Sheppard?

506
00:30:54,077 --> 00:30:55,370
我还活着
I'm still here.

507
00:30:56,496 --> 00:30:59,833
<i>坚持住</i>
<i>我们还在研究</i>
<i>Hang in there Major. </i>
<i>We're working on the problem.</i>

508
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:01,251
我知道你们在努力
I know you are.

509
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:08,550
听着, 我想在我还能说话的时候说几句想说的
Listen, I'd like to say something,
while I still can.

510
00:31:08,716 --> 00:31:11,344
不要! 你会没事的
Don't! You're gonna get through this.

511
00:31:15,932 --> 00:31:21,187
他不会让我死的
If I was. He wouldn't have let me go.

512
00:31:21,771 --> 00:31:23,439
谁不会让你死?
Who wouldn't have let you go?

513
00:31:26,442 --> 00:31:28,319
幽灵们
The Wraith.

514
00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:56,055
我才他没有杀我,
是因为在他眼里我这样比死了更好
I guess he saw me as good as dead,
cos he just walked away.

515
00:31:56,598 --> 00:31:59,726
所以, 我想说的是....
So, what I wanted to say was....

516
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:02,187
留着力气等回来和我说
Save your strength John.
And tell me in person.

517
00:32:02,645 --> 00:32:04,147
这很重要
This is important.

518
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:08,651
我在听
I'm listening.

519
00:32:10,904 --> 00:32:12,655
我们能把他送回基地
We should sent him through the event horizon.

520
00:32:13,072 --> 00:32:16,659
如果McKay博士及时解决了问题,
我们就让少校赶紧回去
If Doctor McKay figures it out in time,
we can fix the Major up on the other side.

521
00:32:16,743 --> 00:32:18,286
如果他不行了, 我们也都死
If he doesn't, we're all dead anyway.

522
00:32:18,328 --> 00:32:19,496
不要给我压力
No pressure.

523
00:32:21,498 --> 00:32:24,250
Sheppard少校不要那么急躁
Major Sheppard would effectively be in suspended
animation for the entire time.

524
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,002
- 我们不能冒这个险
- 为什么不行?
- We can't risk that.
- Why not?

525
00:32:26,085 --> 00:32:28,421
如果这个生物对水有反映,
If the creature reacted that violently
to drops of water,

526
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,507
谁也不知道它对时空门有没有什么反映
who knows how it would react
to Stargate travel.

527
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:33,718
你的意思是说,
只要教授身上有这东西他就不能过时空门?
Are you telling me Major Sheppard can't come
through the gate, while that thing is on him?

528
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:35,803
那么我们现在必须抓紧了!
Then we must do something now!

529
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,981
用起搏器杀了我
Hit me with the defibrillator.

530
00:32:52,111 --> 00:32:54,072
少校你一定是想到什么了
You may be onto something Major.

531
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:56,199
你说过他可能会死的
You said that might kill him.

532
00:32:56,658 --> 00:32:58,284
我们就是这么想的
That's the idea.

533
00:32:58,409 --> 00:32:59,619
我不明白
I don't understand.

534
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,956
Teyla. 你说过这生物和幽灵差不多
Teyla. You said this creature was like a Wraith.

535
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:03,790
是的
Yes.

536
00:33:03,832 --> 00:33:06,459
那么你试想一下
如果上帝让少校死, 他们会怎么做,
Then how do you think it would respond,
if God forbit,

537
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,628
Sheppard少校那上死掉, 那么...
Major Sheppard were to die right now, then.

538
00:33:11,881 --> 00:33:13,591
它就不再附着少校了
It would stop feeding.

539
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,260
没错. 幽灵就会这样
Exactly. Just as a Wraith would.

540
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,886
你们到底是怎么想的?
How is that an idea?

541
00:33:17,053 --> 00:33:20,014
我们只是想欺骗这个生物
它的寄生体已经死了
I'm suggesting that we fool the creature into
thinking that its prey's dead,

542
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:21,636
所以我们必须让少校停止心跳
by stopping the Major's heart.

543
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:24,060
如果想法没错. 它会离开少校的
If I'm right. It should let him go.

544
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,646
一旦生物离开
我们就再击一次让少校苏醒
If that thing let's go.
We give him another jolt.

545
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,858
试一下. 如果不行,
就把他扔进时空门
Give it a try. If it doesn't work,
send him through the event horizon.

546
00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:32,026
他会暂时呆在那
He'll keep there,
as good as the deep freeze.

547
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,869
John, 你确定你要这么做么?
John, are you sure you wanna do this?

548
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:43,037
我真的很想把这该死的东西除掉
I want this damn thing off me.

549
00:33:45,415 --> 00:33:47,125
准备对探险者1号进行急救
Be prepared for a code blue in the Jumper bay.

550
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,294
Ford少尉, 你知道怎么做吧?
Lt Ford, do you know how to do this?

551
00:33:49,586 --> 00:33:52,130
- 是的. 把他衣服割开
- 什么?
- Yes sir. Cut his shirt off.
- What?

552
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:54,090
把他衣服割开!
Cut his shirt off!

553
00:34:01,181 --> 00:34:02,557
200幅. 把他的饰物那开
Charging 200. Move his tags.

554
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:05,727
- 什么?
- 那开里面的胸牌
- What?
- Move his chain, inside.

555
00:34:05,768 --> 00:34:07,562
在表面擦点油
Place the lubrication,right on the paddles.

556
00:34:07,937 --> 00:34:10,023
准备好了
Ready to go.

557
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,280
一旦这虫子掉下来我一定杀了它
Once the bug falls off, I'm gonna have to kill it.

558
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,949
准备下一次,
然后我们再帮你苏醒
Ready to charge up again,
and we'll hit it with another jolt.

559
00:34:20,116 --> 00:34:24,662
McKay, 如果我们第一下不成功,
我们必须再次打开那舱门.
McKay, if we can't restart his heart on the first try,
we'll need that bulkhead door open again.

560
00:34:25,538 --> 00:34:26,706
好的
Done.

561
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,959
我们其中一个必须带他过去
One of us is gonna have to get him through.

562
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,252
我来
I will.

563
00:34:41,221 --> 00:34:42,680
开始吧!
Do it!

564
00:34:48,645 --> 00:34:49,938
没有心跳!
No pulse!

565
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,320
下不来
It won't come off.

566
00:34:57,946 --> 00:35:02,116
冷静. 也许需要一段时间
Settle. It may take a moment.

567
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:07,872
少尉?
Lieutenant?

568
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:47,203
没反映?
Nothing?

569
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:49,622
没反映! 快带他过去
Nothing! Let's get him through.

570
00:35:59,632 --> 00:36:02,135
- 好了?
- 是的
- Got him?
- Yes.

571
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,267
我是Ford少尉. 那个生物已经取下来了
This is Lt Ford. The creature has been
sucessfully removed from Major Sheppard,

572
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:14,022
但是我们无法让他苏醒. 他和Teyla,
现在在时空门的另一端
but we were unable to revive him. Both he and Teyla,
are now on the other side of the event horizon.

573
00:36:16,149 --> 00:36:21,070
谢谢你Rodney少尉, 你们还有7分钟
Thank you Lt. Rodney, you have seven minutes.

574
00:36:45,386 --> 00:36:48,389
我只解决了一部分,
但是我们快没时间了. 我们可能做不到了
I'm only halfway through the possible circuit pathways,
and times almost up. We're not gonna make it.

575
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:49,933
你就做吧. 现在还有时间
Just keep on it. There's still time.

576
00:36:50,016 --> 00:36:51,851
你应该进时空门里面
You should consider stepping
into the event horizon.

577
00:36:51,851 --> 00:36:52,894
我是认真的
I'm serious.

578
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,522
我会坚持到最后的, 但是给你个选择,
最好还是离开
I'll keep trying till the end, but given your choices,
that's a far better way to go.

579
00:36:56,022 --> 00:36:58,233
把你一个人留在这个危险的地方?
Leave you here alone with that thing
wrapped up in my jacket?

580
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:00,193
你确定那东西死了
- 肯定死了
You did check to make sure it was dead.
- It's dead.

581
00:37:00,276 --> 00:37:02,821
很好, 因为爆炸性减压, 然后窒息死亡, 是很有可能....
Good, because explosive decompression, and death
by suffocation with that thing, is possibly....

582
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:04,447
- 干你的活!
- 对不起
- Work!
- I'm sorry

583
00:37:09,452 --> 00:37:10,411
还有多久?
Time?

584
00:37:10,703 --> 00:37:12,163
2分20秒
2 minutes 20 seconds.

585
00:37:12,372 --> 00:37:13,998
Rodney, 又过了2分钟
Rodney, we're down to 2 minutes

586
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,793
我知道时间. 我现在还有2打线路没有试
I know the time. I've still got over two dozen
circuits I haven't tried.

587
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,629
不用按照顺序来. 随意试哪一个
Don't be so methodical. Just pick one at random.

588
00:37:19,754 --> 00:37:22,048
如果那么做, 那样的话我就同时运行了2个系统
If I do that, I run the risk of attempting to
activate the same circuit twice.

589
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,924
试试吧!
Just try!

590
00:37:23,091 --> 00:37:24,592
我告诉你, 那根本不可能....
I'm telling you, there's no way I could....

591
00:37:27,637 --> 00:37:28,721
等等
Wait.

592
00:37:38,231 --> 00:37:39,649
我想我成功了
I think I did it.

593
00:37:44,237 --> 00:37:47,448
Elizabeth?
我估计推进器收回了
Elizabeth?
I think the engine pods retracted.

594
00:37:59,252 --> 00:38:00,753
为什么还是看不到你们?
Why haven't you shown up?

595
00:38:05,925 --> 00:38:07,635
对啊. 为什么我们还是不动?
She's right. Why aren't we moving?

596
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:12,098
是惯性. 飞船是靠惯性穿过时空门的
It's inertia. The drive shift end went
through the Stargate.

597
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,850
我们有没有任何前进的动力了
We've shed all our forward momentum.

598
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:21,274
你再浪费时间. 任何一个力,
都会给予一个相同的反力
You're wasting your time. For every action,
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

599
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,152
那么我们该怎么办?
Then what are we gonna do?

600
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:33,203
还有一分钟
One minute.

601
00:38:36,206 --> 00:38:39,501
后舱. 让后舱爆炸
The rear hatch. Blow the rear hatch.

602
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,544
那么就有足够的力让怎么穿过去了
It should give you enough thrust
to make it through.

603
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:44,088
可以这么做. 但是只有一个机器可以引爆
I can do it. But the only mechanism
to blow the hatch is back here.

604
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:55,141
我来. 没时间了. 快走!
I'll do it. There's no time. Just go!

605
00:38:57,644 --> 00:38:58,937
30秒
30 seconds.

606
00:39:51,281 --> 00:39:52,740
我去通道
I'll be in the Jumper bay.

607
00:40:01,374 --> 00:40:02,625
再来一次!
Again!

608
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,177
他会没事的
He's gonna be fine.

609
00:40:33,406 --> 00:40:34,782
干得不错Rodney
Well done Rodney.

610
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:35,783
看着吧
We'll see.

611
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,455
有脉搏了
We've got a pulse.

612
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,922
心跳越来越强了
It's getting stronger.

613
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,596
他很快就没事了
He's going to be ok.

614
00:41:36,135 --> 00:41:37,053
感觉如何?
How are you feeling?

615
00:41:37,178 --> 00:41:38,096
饿
Starving.

616
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:42,600
他可弄了不少吻痕, 但是Beckett医生说
他几天就好
He's got quite the hickey, but Dr Beckett says
he'll be fine in a few days.

617
00:41:43,518 --> 00:41:44,686
你需要休息
We should let you rest.

618
00:41:44,727 --> 00:41:45,979
不, 你应该给我点吃的
No, you should get me food.

619
00:41:46,062 --> 00:41:47,647
我想可以安排
I think we can arrange that.

620
00:41:47,814 --> 00:41:49,149
早日康复
Welcome back sir.

621
00:41:49,232 --> 00:41:51,526
这真是个奇迹
I must admit, it is a pleasant surprise.

622
00:41:51,985 --> 00:41:54,779
顺便说一下. 你上次想说什么?
By the way. What were you gonna say?

623
00:41:55,155 --> 00:41:55,864
什么时候?
When?

624
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:59,617
在你认为... 你知道的
Before, when you thought... ou know

625
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,162
哦 那件事啊
Oh that.

626
00:42:02,162 --> 00:42:06,082
那时候我没让你说
但是现在我想知道
I didn't want you to say at the time.
But now I'm curious.

627
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,418
我那时候想说...
I was gonna say...

628
00:42:15,425 --> 00:42:17,093
你们大家要互相照顾
Take care of each other.

629
00:42:19,512 --> 00:42:20,638
不错
That's nice.

630
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:24,142
我们也是这么做的
And indeed we did.

631
00:42:24,184 --> 00:42:27,770
是的你做到了. 再次感谢
Yes you did. Thank you, again.

632
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:28,980
没什么
You're welcome.

633
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:30,231
晚安
Goodnight.

634
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:39,407
你一定不是想说那句话,
对吧?
You weren't really gonna say that,
were you?

635
00:42:40,283 --> 00:42:42,911
我不知道你想说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

636
00:42:43,953 --> 00:42:45,663
你一定知道


I didn't think so.
