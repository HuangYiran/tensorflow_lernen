00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Summon a vision and see what our future holds.

103
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I must get the visioning potion just right.

104
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The magic is always strongest during the blue moon.

105
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So far, so good. Lots of smiles and smurf berries.

106
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clumsy's sitting still. That's always good.

107
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A dragon wand.

108
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I got it! I got it!

109
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clumsy.

110
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Help! Save us! - Papa!

111
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Papa!

112
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clumsy, what have you done?

113
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, Papa. - Clumsy?

114
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you okay?

115
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Fine.

116
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why aren't you rehearsing for the Blue Moon celebration?

117
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know. A couple guys got smacked in the face,

118
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}so I thought I'd make some smurf root mud packs

119
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to take down everyone's swelling.

120
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Papa, you're smurf out of smurf root. I'll go pick some.

121
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Those fields are too close to Gargamel's castle.

122
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll get the smurf root.

123
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You stay in the village and out of trouble. Do you understand?

124
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. If you say so.

125
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A vision's never been wrong. I can't let this happen to my Smurfs.

126
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Just stay in the village, Clumsy."

127
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at all this smurf root. They are gonna be so proud of me.

128
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's see, just a few more...

129
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Gargamel! - Boo.

130
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help!

131
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good kitty. Good kitty. Look! Look!

132
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A ball of yarn!

133
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A nice, juicy bird!

134
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, that's it!

135
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's invisible.

136
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Those sneaky... Wait, wait, wait, wait.

137
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We don't know if it's safe.

138
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Azrael?

139
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you dead?

140
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, what did you see in your vision, Papa?

141
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing apocalyptic, really.

142
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything's going to be just fine.

143
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perfect. Another year we don't have to worry about that mean, old...

144
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Gargamel! - I know who she meant, Clumsy.

145
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no! Gargamel!

146
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I Gargamel!, kinda, sorta accidentally led him to the village.

147
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gargamel!

148
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurf for your lives!

149
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody skedaddle!

150
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Into the forest, Smurfs! - Come on, Clumsy!

151
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sound the alarm, Crazy.

152
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is really bad!

153
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfs, that way!

154
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, cat! Azrael, over here! Come on!

155
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There you go, you nasty cat.

156
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This way! - This is no joke!

157
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look out! - Papa!

158
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let go! Cursed nature!

159
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here comes papa, Papa!

160
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:08,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Papa, your primitive little defenses, they're useless against me, sir!

161
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I laugh at them.

162
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How's that for primitive, Gargamel?

163
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe this will all blow over.

164
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can fix this. I just gotta think.

165
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

166
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Follow me, everyone!

167
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Save yourselves!

168
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clumsy! You're going the wrong way!

169
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's headed for the Forbidden Falls! - With the blue moon coming?

170
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Quickly, Smurfs! Stop him! - Unbelievable!

171
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The one time we want him to trip and he's running perfectly!

172
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Clumsy! - Oh, this is a predicament.

173
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Anybody reading these signs?

174
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a predicament! This guy's killing me!

175
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like we're down to 99 Smurfs!

176
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not good at all.

177
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clumsy!

178
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help!

179
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we tried. Let's go.

180
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on, lad! We'll form a Smurf bridge to get you.

181
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not the Smurf bridge!

182
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There we go. - Yeah, pardon me.

183
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is not a Smurf bridge, it's clearly a chain...

184
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurf it, Brainy!

185
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The blue moon! - Oh, dear.

186
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's happening, Papa? - What the blinking flip is that?

187
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no!

188
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The vision! - Come on, guys!

189
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Pull him up! - Hurry!

190
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't let go! Help!

191
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help!

192
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look out for the hole!

193
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, it's more of a vortex. Of a portal.

194
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurf up! It's a hole.

195
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hold on!

196
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no!

197
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Looks like you got the short end of the stick, eh, Papa?

198
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now you belong to me!

199
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not this time, Gargamel!

200
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's wrong with you?

201
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was great! Let's have another go.

202
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you smurfed? We almost died in there!

203
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're not even wet.

204
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What part of the enchanted forest is this?

205
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My calculations indicate...

206
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's slimy.

207
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think we're in Smurf village any more.

208
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my.

00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Smurfs? You may Want to take a look at this. - What is it?

210
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are we listening to him? He just got us sucked through a giant hole.

211
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not a hole, it's a vortex.

212
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And can't we just go around the rock?

213
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my smurf.

214
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where the smurf are we?

215
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:10,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Up the smurfing creek without a paddle, that's where.

216
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, at least they're not coming after us.

217
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah. Really?

218
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, dear. - Azrael!

219

220
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Azrael? Are you dead?

221
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,500

222
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,140

223
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Guys, come on! - Go!

227
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,440

228
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,490

229
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you could not stand directly in front of the display,

230
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but over to the sides, it'd be a bit more visible. Hey, look, product.

231
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Also, don't forget to smile.

232
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Remember, you're working for a cosmetics company. That's it.

233
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smile, relax, everyone will have a good time. Let's go!

234

236
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On top of everything with the campaign, Patrick?

237
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, as much as I can be.

238
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We certainly did our homework. We tested the results.

239
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Patrick!

240
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She's pointing at me. - That can't be good.

241
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Odile, it looks fantastic for Thursday's launch.

242
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's gonna be quite the gala.

243
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he is. My new vice president of marketing.

244
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- So, wait, you fired Ralph? - His campaign was rubbish.

245
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He gave me what I asked for, not what I want.

246
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you give me what I want?

247
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that what you're asking for?

248
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How would I know what I'm asking for when I don't even know what I want?

249
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well said, Odile. Well said. That's why you need me.

250
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Exacto! I need you to create a new campaign for Jouvenel.

251
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All digital, of course, so it can be ready on time for the launch.

252
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Odile, that's two days.

253
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See me gotta said, and it mustn't be delayed. Is that going to be a problem?

254
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, I mean for a whole new campaign, it's kind of tight.

255
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But... No, two days is perfect.

256
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}God only needed six days for the whole world, right?

257
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fail me, and maybe you can go and work for him.

258
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are we, Azrael?

259
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What manner of freakish realm is this?

260
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, one more box of research. Hey, would you get a cab for me, please?

261
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, yes, of course.

262
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This day just keeps getting better and better.

263
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we're just gonna jump in the portal, get back to our village

264
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and everybody's happy, right?

265
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, guys. Let's stay smurftimistic.

266
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what? I choose to be pessismurfstic.

267
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're all gonna die.

268
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Papa Smurf, how do we get home with the portal closed?

269
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure when the blue moon rises tonight,

270
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}the portal will open again.

271
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, let's take shelter till dark.

272
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, let's get smurfing.

273
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, but I'm not happy.

274
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Azrael! - Run, Smurfs!

275
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,490

00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't we just go around the tree?

287

324
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thanks a lot. Have a good night. - I hope Clumsy can breathe in that box.

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every window? Piece of cake.

330
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Grace? Hello?

353
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Ho, you can't come to the ultrasound.

354
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Unless...

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could retool those. I'd have to work around the clock.

00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How to find the Smurfs?

00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If only I had something of theirs. A drop of spittle. A fingernail.

363
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some hair, even.Then I could make some Smurf magic.

364
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very nice. Are you done now?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? What?

367
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is that... No. No, it can't be.

00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With my skills, even this small trifle of smurfiness

374
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}will yield me just enough power to catch them all!

00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:38,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I must find a laboratory with which to tease the magic from these precious little strands.

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. It's a bit small, but this should do nicely!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to invoke the blue moon.

505
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You hear that, honey?

506
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're only staying till an actual blue moon rises.

507
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:42,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which could happen if the little blue Santa man makes a magic potion,

508
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}which, at this point, seems completely plausible.

509
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Want a bite? - No, thank you.

510
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course, the stars will need to be perfectly aligned.

511
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:54,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when that might be is hard to determine without the proper instrument.

512
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Master Winslow, might I borrow your stargazer?

513
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My what-whatzer?

514
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't have a Stargazer. Do you?

515
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is all my fault. We're all gonna die.

516
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're all gonna die! Smurf out of it, scaredy-brains!

517
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- One Panicky Smurf is enough! - Hey!

518
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Besides, Papa had a vision, and everything turns out smurfy.

519
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Right, Papa?

520
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, yes. It all turns out just fine.

521
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We must find this Smurf thief.Stop your complaining.

522
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I were a Smurf, where would I go?

523
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You there, you there. Fancy pants. Have you seen any little blue men?

524
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Absolutely. What price are we talking about? - You're selling them?

525
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Have you looked in the drawer, sweetie? - Wait, what drawer?

526
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:42,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- In the kitchen, Lilly. - Who is this Lilly?

527
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you kidding? She's the hottest girl in my department.

528
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, please. Please, young woodsman.

529
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:51,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What does the temperature of this Lilly have to do with the finding of Smurfs?

530
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Take your meds, man. - What?

531
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is everyone in this realm completely insane?

532
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank the gods, a local wizard. Excellent.

533
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pardon me, wise sir?

534
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By any chance, have you seen any little blue men?

535
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're everywhere!

536
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew it. I knew it!I told you we were close, Azrael.

537
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

538
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:21,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, just take one, everybody.We have to make sure our smurf berries last.

539
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. We're gonna be here how long?

540
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not long. First,we have to get a Stargazer.

541
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:29,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Next, find a book of spells and then smurf a portal

542
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we're home. Very simple, my little Smurfs.

543
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye, Elway.

544
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone looks smurfalish!

545
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why you wearing a leash? - It's a tie.

546
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Does it keep your neck warm? - No.

547
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clearly, it functions as an aid in his craft, like a blacksmith's apron.

548
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wear it because it's what everyone wears at work.

549
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you, you pasty giant?

550
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I try to get people to buy things by analyzing market trend predictions.

551
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Predictions! He's a fortune teller.

552
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, I would love to explain but I am super late. I gotta go.

553
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I really don't have time for this. - What?

554
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You had one outfit on,

555
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and now you're wearing something completely different.

556
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah. It... - Now, Smurfette,

557
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}she probably got the other one dirty.

558
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's not embarrass her. - Sorry.

559
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thanks for letting us stay in your mushroom,Miss Grace.

560
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:19,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's really nice. - Well, thank you. I'm glad you like it.

561
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like our little mushroom, too. But you know,somebody wants a bigger mushroom.

562
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But, then you'd be further apart.

563
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said it, sister. Okay, I've gotta go. I've got an appointment.

564
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:32,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got a baby on the way, so...

565
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, wait. We can't just leave them here alone, without an adult.

566
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm 546 years old.

567
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course you are.

568
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll be fine. They'll be fine.All right.

569
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Love you. - Okay.

570
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bye. Bye. - Bye, Grace! Goodbye.

571
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the way, I wouldn't go anywhere if I were you.

572
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why not?

573
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our world doesn't do well with visitors from other places.

574
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, look what happened to E.T.

575
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a movie. A moving picture.

576
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Book. Just stay, okay?

577
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. He's gone and we still don't have a Stargazer.

578
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a smurf. If he's a fortune teller, he reads stars all the time.

579
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ergo, it's at his place of business.

580
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Excellent work, Brainy.

581
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are we waiting for? Let's ride.

582
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, come on, guys. Hey, stop it.

583
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on, Smurfs! - Let's go get that Stargazer.

584
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Surprise, surprise. - Oh, no.

585
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clumsy, I think it might be best

586
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}if you stay here. You know?

587
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurf an eye on the mushroom.

588
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

589
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This way, Smurfs! Let's follow Mr. Winslow.

590
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I can smurf an eye on the mushroom.

591
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurf away!

592
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Let's smurf this joint. - Is he down there?

593
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Taxi! - Can you see him?

594
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, he's getting into the mechanical wagon.

595
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no. Clearly that distance is too great...

596
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Off you go! - No! Gutsy!

597
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Smurfs! Smurfabunga!

598
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye, blue world.

599
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Use your hat, you ninny!

600
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Couldn't we just have taken the stairs?

601
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There we go. - Not funny, Gutsy.

602
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It was a little funny. - Smurfs.

603
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,430

610
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What part of "we need a Stargazer" don't you understand, you numptie?

611
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You can't be out in public. - Who are you talking to?

612
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If we could just have a quick look around in your predicting parlor...

613
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We really wanna go home. - Come on, man, I gotta go.

614
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Fine. Just come here, come here. - Please, please.

615
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All of you. Trust me.

616
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Careful. Hey, watch the smurf berries.

617
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not going... Hey!

618
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Be quiet. - It's dark in here.

619
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, who smurfed?

620

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Get your hand out of my kilt.

621
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's not my hand. - Hey, ticklish.

622
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Morning. Morning. - Good morning, Mr. Winslow.

623
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Congratulations on your promotion. - Thank you.

624
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope you guys like desk drawers,because that's where...

625
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're late. - Odile!

626
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were in my office.

627
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's my building, and we have much work to do.

628
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The launch for Jouvenel is tomorrow night. Is your concept ready?

629
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Close. I had a crazy morning.

630

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

631
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:29,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing. I'm excited. I'm excited about all the concept ideas.

632
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:33,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And hungry. Sorry. Hungry for its success.

633
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nervous energy.

634
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nervous energy's what's going on up in here.

635
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I like it. - Yep.

636
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The fear of failure is a fabulous motivator. - True that.

637
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Stop it.

638
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Henri. - Make it work.

639
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have no idea.

640
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What is this? - Why did I get the armpit?

641
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:56,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stop pushing me. - Go easy on the cologne tomorrow.

642
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you crazy?

643
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're gonna get me fired. - My hair!

644
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I couldn't even breathe in there. - It smelled like the business end of a sheep.

645
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't see a Stargazer. - How you doing?

646
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry, Master Winslow, but we badly need to borrow your Stargazer.

647
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't have a Stargazer, okay?

648
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:17,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not something people of this century just have, especially here.

649
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Not happy. - Now if you'll excuse me, I have to work.

650
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well,perhaps we could sing to help things along.

651
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And then we'll get the stargazer.Come along, Smurfs.

652
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}La la la la la la Sing a happy song

653

654
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop.

655

658
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. None of you find that song just the tiniest bit annoying?

659
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I find it annoying.

660
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what do you sing at work?

661
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't sing at work. - What?

662
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And you have to wear a leash. - Harsh.

663
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. How about if we hum?

664
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:59,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Huh huh huh huh huh - Please stop humming.

665
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to hone my message here.

666
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:08,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've got a message.

667
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Always chew with your mouth closed." Papa taught us that.

668

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's good. You should use that.

669
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Or, "Dance and be happy."

670
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about, "Grab life by the grapes"?

671
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Turn that frown upside down." "Always bet on blue."

672
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- "Have a smurfy day." - "I kissed a Smurf and I liked it"?

673
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's an embarrassment of riches.

674
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're giving you gold here.

675

677
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Right, Smurfs? - Yeah.

678

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You said it. - Of course.

679

00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:49,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I love emerging dramatically through the smoke.

681
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:56,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It makes... It makes me feel so deliciously mysterious.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Also, it gives the skin a wonderful glow.

683

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

706
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Astonishing, really.

707
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I see no transformation.

708
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Your potion has no power. - Excuse me?

709
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, she's still an eye-offending dogfish, if you ask me.

710
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:23,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sir! - This is my mother who you're speaking of.

711
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry. I didn't realize.

712
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How sad for you in 30 years.

713

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did you do that?

720
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, and seriously, me next.

00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:04,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So sorry, but lunatics and great wizards never reveal their secrets.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no, no, no. Don't go.

724
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I need to know what you just did. - Not telling.

733
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gargamel.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm...

736
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:02,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. Did you just say "genius"?

737
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, even though I'm what you might call accident-prone,

738
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}on the bright side, I did land us all here in your little mushroom,

739
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and we got to meet you and Patrick.

740
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:15,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're so sweet. And I know how you feel. I'm so clumsy, too.

741
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I used to be.

742
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Really? - Yeah.

743
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:22,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So how long did it take you to...

744
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gosh.

745
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Un-fumble your feet?

746
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:33,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, about as long as it takes to realize that nobody's just one thing.

747
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can be anything you wanna be.

748
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- "Hero Smurf." - Yeah.

749
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably not.

750
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, Brainy, help me figure this out. - Let me show you.

753
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}La la la la la la Sing a happy song

754
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:57,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a fascinating wind machine you have here.

755
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hi, Patrick. - Grace, help. Help!

00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They are everywhere and they won't stop singing.

757
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I cannot get a thing done. Please come and get these guys.

758
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Señor Gargamel, I'll be frank.

759
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:23,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Clinique, Lancôme, MAC. They will kill to get what you have in that ring.

760
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not if we Kill them first.

761
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's see, we're going to need some knights, preferably in shining armor,

762
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}some bowmen, poison arrows.

763
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like the way you think.

764
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And some spikes to mount their heads on.

765
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, it is all about the presentation.

766
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, of course, all of our testing would be animal cruelty-free?

767
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:46,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What, they pay extra for the animal cruelty? - Is that it?

768
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get out of here.

769
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have a wicked sense of humor.

770
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We like that, don't we? - Hey, out of here!

771

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Henri?

772
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I said, get out of here.

773
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Señor Gargamel, now you must assure me, darling,

774
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}that you can recreate whatever it was that you did to my mother,

775
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:09,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but on a massive scale.

776
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:13,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do that, and the world will worship you.

777
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Did you hear that, Azrael? - Yeah.

778
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:23,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Worship." Oh, it rolls off the tongue like flesh from a... Not pilgrim...

780
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:30,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank the gods, a chamber pot.

781
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This swill that you call Dom Pérignon has gone straight to my nether regions.

782
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here, toss this out the window, yeah? Today, please.

783
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, to the matter at hand.

784
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So do we have a deal, señor?

785
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not quite, my sweet maiden.

786
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:04,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see, first I must have my Smurfs.

787
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys just have to understand that Patrick's under a lot of pressure right now.

788
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:13,780

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well done, Master Winslow. - Oh! Hey, guys, Papa's back.

1004
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Papa, are your calculations done? - Yeah!

1005
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm nearly out of smurf berries.

1006
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:04,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's proving more difficult than I'd hoped.

1007
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:06,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we are going home, right?

1008
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:09,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course. Just not tonight.

1009
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, off to bed.

1010
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was hoping I'd be sleeping in my mushroom tonight.

1011
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I miss the other Smurfs.

1012
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:24,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Me, too.

1013
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never spent the night away from home before.

1014
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:31,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, there was last night. But who could sleep?

1015
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hush. Hush now, Smurfs.

1016
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:39,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything's going to be just fine.

1017
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Papa?

1018
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:45,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you really believe we're ever gonna get home to the other Smurfs?

1019
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:47,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't worry.

1020
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:50,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll be reunited with the others soon enough.

1021
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If only the stars would align.

1022
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:10,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know who I miss? Chef Smurf. Hefty Smurf.

1023
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, Jokey Smurf. - Greedy. Narrator.

1024
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Painter. Baker. - Harmony.

1025
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:21,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I miss Complimentary Smurf. He always has such nice things to say.

1026
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll tell you who I don't miss, Passive-Aggressive Smurf.

1027
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:25,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Aye. - Yeah.

1028
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:29,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's always so nice, but when he leaves you feel bad.

1029
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:34,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, another wretched Smurf less night.

1030
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:37,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, hello, little moth.

1031
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:43,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps with your help I'll find a way to get them back.

1032
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, you and I are kindred spirits, little one.

1033
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Both of us meant to soar.

1034
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:55,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go now, and bring back an army of mighty eagles to free me.

1035
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:59,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fly, tiny eagle.Fly and bring back your brethren.

1036
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fly! Fly!

1037
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fly!

1038
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:11,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Let's see here.

1039
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.

1040
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:14,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm guessing you have a long night ahead of you.

1041
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:19,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You guys drink coffee? - Is a Smurf's butt blue?

1042
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:27,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So tell me, that weird guy in the ratty bathrobe at the toy store?

1043
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:29,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Gargamel? - He's not really a wizard, is he?

1044
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:34,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not the smartest of sorcerers, but dangerous just the same.

1045
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

1046
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:40,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Back home, I could hold him at bay with a spell or two.

1047
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But here, without my books and potions...

1048
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:48,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, today we got lucky. But next time, who knows?

1049
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what are you gonna do?

1050
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:54,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll do anything and everything I can do to get my Smurfs home.

1051
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:58,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't ever give up. They're my family.

1052
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:01,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you never give up on family.

1053
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doesn't it freak you out sometimes

1054
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}having all those little guys depending on you?

1055
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, what if you screw up?

1056
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How'd you know when you were ready?

1057
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here. Come sit on Papa's lap.

1058
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, right. Scratch that.

1059
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:28,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Probably not the best idea. - Yeah, yeah.

1060
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me ask you something.

1061
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:33,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why did you come for us today when your Grace called?

1062
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She needed me. I could hear it in her voice.

1063
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:41,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, that's what being a papa is.

1064
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:44,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When it comes time, you just do.

1065
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:49,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And knowing what to do doesn't come from up here.

1066
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It comes from here, where it matters most.

1067
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:58,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My spleen?

1068
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:01,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, your heart.

1069
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:05,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm trying to have a moment here, you whippersnapper.

1070
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:13,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're a good papa, Papa. - And you'll be a good one, too.

1071
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, what you doing, man? Get that weight off there.

1072
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, baby, stop playing.

1073
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:40,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, you silly moth. Where are my eagles?

1074
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know what happens to people who sit on my bench?

1075
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be gone with you, behemoth,

1076
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:50,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for I have instructed a moth to summon forth a gaggle of noble eagles

1077
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:52,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to free me from this confine.

1078
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get up, Grandpa!

1079
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:57,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey.You see? You see?

1080
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:01,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The dungeon isn't built that can hold the likes of Gargamel.

1081
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:06,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Behold my glorious army of... Flies?

1082
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:09,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Flies? I Said "to fly." "Fly." - What is this?

1083
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:13,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not "flies," you light-loving moron.

1084
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:16,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, up, up, up, bother it all.

1085
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:20,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Up! Up, you inglorious devils!

1086
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:22,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So long, scallywags!

1087
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, don't do it again. Go around it, go around!

1088
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:32,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, that's nasty. - Go around it. Stupid flies.

1089
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:33,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, take me with you!

1090
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:35,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait! Wait!

1091
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:42,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To my castle for more essence!

1092
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:54,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Here they come, here they come.

1093
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:01,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pretty smurfy, if I do say so myself.

1094
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:04,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Elway, right over here. Good boy. Thank you very much.

1095
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, my goodness. Here we go.

1096
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:09,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There we are. - Clumsy.

1097
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:12,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Blue thumbs. - This is unbelievable.

1098
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think there's too much pink.

1099
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just because your name is Grouchy doesn't mean you always have to be grouchy.

1100
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, it does.

1101
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hi. - Smurfette.

1102
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:24,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- High five. High four. - High four.

1103
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:29,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great news! The stars have revealed a perfect time to smurf the blue moon.

1104
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're going home! Yay! I knew you'd do it, Papa!

1105
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:35,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- All right! - Smurftastic!

1106
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:37,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never doubted it for a second.

1107
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:41,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It has to be done tonight, between first star and high moon.

1108
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's our only chance.

1109
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:46,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But we'll need a magic spell that works in this realm

1110
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to open the portal home.

1111
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Master Winslow, a question, please. - Yeah, shoot.

1112
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is there a place that sells spells?

1113
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:55,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

1114
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:59,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Is there a place that proffers potions? - Yeah, no.

1115
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How about old books?

1116
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:04,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, there's an antique book shop right near where I work.

1117
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Dr. Wong's. Yeah. Dr. Wong's something.

1118
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:09,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Perfect. That'll do. - Oh, hear that, boys? We're almost home.

1119
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah! - I love being almost home.

1120
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Smurf hug!

1121
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I love you guys!

1122
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:19,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bring it in, big fella.

1123
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:20,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I wouldn't... - Come on, we know you want to.

1124
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes. - Yeah, come on, Patrick.

1125
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:23,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- If I can do it, you can do it. - Go on, big fella.

1126
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:25,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Here he comes! - Smurf hug!

1127
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:27,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We're goin' home! - Hey there.

1128
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:35,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, get up here.

1129
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's it, laddie. Nice one. - What's that?

1130
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah. All of ya. All of ya!

1131
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:49,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, look! We don't have to make a blue moon.

1132
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:50,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've already got one.

1133
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Really? - What?

1134
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:55,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look, guys, right over there. - No, it isn't.

1135
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It is. Smurfette's right. Look at the blue moon.

1136
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:02,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's the wrong ad.

1137
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What happened to my office?

1138
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:18,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We fixed it for the baby. Another smurf hug!

1139
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:21,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No, no, no. This isn't happening. This isn't happening.

1140
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone sent this to the ad agency last night.

1141
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:27,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who messed with my computer? - I dunno.

1142
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:30,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- None of my Smurfs would... - Wasn't me.

1143
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:38,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I might sort of, tripped.

1144
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:41,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, well, you Gargamel!, sorta, just got me fired.

1145
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You sent the wrong file.

1146
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:45,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Patrick, it was just an accident. What am I supposed to do, Grace?

1147
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:48,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said that they would bring good luck. This is anything but good.

1148
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:51,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never should've let this happen. I should've said no.

1149
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:55,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never wanted a house full of little people running around!

1150
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:00,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blue. Little blue...

1151
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:02,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay...

1152
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:04,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Patrick.

1153
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:07,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing?

1154
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Going to try to save my job.

1155
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:12,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We never intended to be a burden, Master Winslow.

1156
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm smurfilly sorry about what I...

1157
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:18,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop saying "smurf" for everything. What does that even mean? Smurf!

1158
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfitty-smurf-smurf-smurf!

1159
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no call for that kind of language, laddie.

1160
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:25,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See?

1161
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:27,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Patrick, wait.

1162
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, hey! - Will you...

1163
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, Patrick. Maybe I can try to fix it.

1164
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:33,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just stop and listen to me for a second, please.

1165
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:36,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - Look, I'm really sorry about your job, okay?

1166
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:38,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I hope that you can straighten that out.

1167
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you are so not seeing the big picture here.

1168
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:45,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, look around. Look what's happening right now.

1169
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of all the people on the planet,

1170
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:49,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}those magical little creatures came to us.

1171
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They chose us.

1172
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:55,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you see how absolutely amazing that is?

1173
01:07:55,490 --> 01:07:57,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, Patrick.

1174
01:07:57,830 --> 01:07:59,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is our blue moon.

1175
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:04,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And if you don't stop for just a second to see that,

1176
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're gonna miss it.

1177
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey. Taxi!

1178
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:20,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on! Come on! Blast. Blast you!

1179
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's got to be some essence in here somewhere!

1180
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:25,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not now.

1181
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What? What?

1182
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:36,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very, very well done, my little friend.

1183
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:40,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And to think, I almost ate you that time.

1184
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:46,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come, Azrael. We must find this Patrick, the rouge merchant.

1185
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:50,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He will lead us to our elusive little blue quarry.

1186
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:54,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you just have a switch or something to shut them off?

1187
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:55,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomorrow? Are you kidding me?

1188
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:59,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ron, Ron. If I don't get those ads down now, I don't have a job tomorrow.

1189
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurf me.

1190
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Which way to the bookstore, Brainy?

1191
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:25,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}According to the searching device,

1192
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}we take the F machine two dots past the red circle to Chinaland.

1193
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:30,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look out, Brainy. - "Chinatown," birdbrain.

1194
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:31,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Smurftito, smurftato. - Here it is.

1195
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:32,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Come on, everybody. - Let's go, let's go.

1196
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mind the gap. - Wait? Are we sure about this?

1197
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:35,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - Jump!

1198
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, my. - Not happy.

1199
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:42,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, Brainy_ Let's poke around this great steel carriage.

01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is it safe? Of course it is.

1201

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That was great.

1202
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:53,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope we find this place soon. I can't see out of this...

1203
01:10:55,170 --> 01:10:56,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For smurf's sake.

1204
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought that's why we left Clumsy behind.

1205
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, it smells like butter in here.

1206
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:02,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where do you suppose this magic bookstore could be?

1207
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:03,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wait a minute. - There it is.

1208
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:05,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's closed. - Figures.

1209
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We have to find a way in. Come on.

01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This place looks creepy to me.

1215
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not creepy, it's different. And I like it.

1216
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's just get the book and get outta here.

01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am but a simple wizard with a simple desire, limitless power and world adulation.

1219
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:40,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now why does it have to be so hard?

1220
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:49,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pardon me. Please, wise sir. Wise sir. Please, please.

1221
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wherever did you hear that ear-damning squall?

1222
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:53,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's your little blue men.

1223
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:56,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw them going into the bookstore around the corner.

1224
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:01,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, that song is really annoying.

1225
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cautiously excited.

01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:08,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's not it. That's not it. Hey! Oh, no, that's not it.

01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at all these amazing books. It's gotta be in here somewhere.

1228
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:14,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, this isn't it. You see anything, Smurfette?

1229
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:17,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothin' up here, guys. Look out below!

01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:21,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I've got somethin', lads. - Great job, Gutsy.

1231

01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:29,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well done. - Just a minute. That's it. There we go.

01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Listen, listen. Before you fire me,

1301
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:34,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know that the ads that ran weren't the ads I sent.

1302
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:38,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they're the ads I should have sent.

1303
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:41,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The ads I almost did send.

1304
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:44,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I didn't 'cause...

1305
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:47,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I second-guessed myself.

1306
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:53,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I gave you what I thought you wanted, instead of what I thought was right.

1307
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:58,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But this is right.

1308
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:01,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It means something to me and... I don't know,

1309
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think it's gonna mean something to others, too.

1310
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:10,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not just a moon, Odile, it's a blue moon.

1311
01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:13,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Once in a blue moon."

1312
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:19,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That means that there are only a few moments in your life

1313
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:26,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when something truly memorable, truly magical, happens to you.

1314
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:33,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, if you hesitate, if you're afraid,

1315
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:36,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you might just miss it.

1316
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:40,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what that image means.

1317
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:45,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't let those blue moon moments pass you by.

1318
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:51,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will call you back to tell you if you're fired.

1319
01:17:57,490 --> 01:17:59,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I so smurf in' love you.

1320
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:05,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Left-left, right! Right-right, bird!

1321
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:07,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Brace for impact! - The window's open, ya ninny.

1322
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:11,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're outta control!

1323
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, bird! Watch out for the...

1324
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That'll do, pigeon. Thank you, bird.

1325
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:18,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look! We got the incantation.

1326
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:20,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where's Papa? - Gargamel's got him.

1327
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - Oh, no.

1328
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:26,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He took him to some place called BellVeedaRay Castle.

1329
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's gonna... - Don't say it.

1330
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:31,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}BellVeedaRay. What is BellVeedaRay?

1331
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:34,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Belve... He's taken him to Belvedere Castle in Central Park.

1332
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To extract his essence.

1333
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:38,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? Well, we have to go get him. - Yeah.

1334
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:41,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Gargamel's more powerful than ever.

1335
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:44,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Papa said no matter what happens we're not to go back for him.

1336
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:45,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's trying to protect us.

1337
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:49,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No! We can't leave Papa behind. - It was a Smurf promise.

1338
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:51,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no. We can't.

1339
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We promised Papa we'd do exactly what he said.

1340
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:56,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- That's right. - I didn't.

1341
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:59,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never promised him anything.

1342
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:03,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neither did I. And there is no way I'm leaving here without Papa.

1343
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:08,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Patrick, wait. I'm coming with you.

1344
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:13,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm in.

1345
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:18,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aye. Me, too.

1346
01:19:21,070 --> 01:19:25,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No Smurf left behind! Not Papa, and not you.

1347
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:29,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All for one and one for Smurf! All for one and one for Smurf!

1348
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:37,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I 'll squeeze a few And tweeze a few

1349
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:39,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And steal their essence blue

1350
01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:47,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very impressive, my dear, sweet little Papa!

1351
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, look at this.

1352
01:19:53,300 --> 01:20:00,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just a tiny little bit of your little tiny beard yields me all of this essence.

1353
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:07,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Just imagine what I'll be able to harvest from your entire family of Smurfs.

1354
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Alakazookas!

1355
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:16,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Behold my glorious Smurf magic machine!

1356
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:25,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No. No! The cages! No! No!

1357
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:28,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll steam the essence from their sweat. I'll tug it from their tears!

1358
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll snip it from their hair.

1359
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:34,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a fool, Gargamel.

1360
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:37,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My Smurfs are well on their way home by now.

1361
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:05,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah. Let's light this candle.

1362
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:13,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good luck, Gutsy!

1363
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:17,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Into the breach! - I'll see you there!

1364
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:32,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- We all remember the plan, right? - Let's get our smurf on.

1365
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:33,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Brainy, what's happening?

1366
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:37,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've added the ingredients. It's more powerful than anticipated.

1367
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:39,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think I can do it.

1368
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:43,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Brainy, you can do this. Just say the incantation.

1369
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:01,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be smurfed!

1370
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:06,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did it. I did it, Papa! I did it!

1371
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:12,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't believe it! - Wow.

1372
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:15,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's the Anjelou moon. - How did she do that?

1373
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's beautiful. - Oh, Odile.

1374
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:21,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, wow. - That's wonderful.

1375
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, I don't want you to worry, Papa.

1376
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:35,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That which doesn't kill you only makes me stronger.

1377
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yo! - Huh?

1378
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:42,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gargamel! Come out and play!

1379
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:45,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I think our tiny little guests have finally arrived.

1380
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:47,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No! - Ah, well.

1381
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:50,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Enjoy the ride, Papa!

1382
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:53,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And remember, keep your hands and feet

1383
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:56,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- inside the cart at all times. - No. No! No!

1384
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:58,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfs, run!

1385
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:02,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Smurfs.

1386
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:11,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have our Papa. Prepare to get smurfed!

1387
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:13,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, what he said.

1388
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:15,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Adorable.

1389
01:23:15,210 --> 01:23:18,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Two little smurfs come to save their beloved Papa.

1390
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:20,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Gargamel.

1391
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:24,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Make that three little smurfs.

1392
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:31,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I went home and got a few friends.

1393
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:53,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My, my, my!

1394
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:56,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think the whole village must be here.

1395
01:23:57,710 --> 01:24:02,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever will I do with all this essence?

1396
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}On me, boys.

1397
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:06,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fire!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To the portal, everyone! There's no time to spare.

1502

1505

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bye. - ake care.

1506
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:11,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hated this. So much less than I expected.

1507
01:31:11,390 --> 01:31:15,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Bye, Grouchy. - Don't get me wrong, I still hated it. Just less.

1508
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:20,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll not soon forget this place. Especially not with these! Tallyho!

1509

1512
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:34,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'll never forget you. - Smurfette.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}High four.

1514

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}High four, Grace.

1515

1518
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:51,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, actually, you mind saying it one more time?

1519
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:52,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's kinda got a nice ring to it.

1520
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:01,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye, Grace. Well, Master Winslow, thank you.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You saved my whole family.

1523
01:32:06,770 --> 01:32:09,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually I think it was the other way around.

1524
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:14,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, I should get going. I've got a Smurf village to rebuild.

1525
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:16,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your village has given me some ideas.

1526
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come here.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye, Papa.

1529
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:41,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go home.

1530
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:49,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And so, the Smurfs left the strange city of New York,

1531
01:32:49,610 --> 01:32:53,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and I think they left it a little sweeter, a little wiser,

1532
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:56,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a little smurfier.

1533
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And as that portal began to close for the last time...

1534
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Seriously, stop!

1535
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:04,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bye, New York!

1536
01:33:13,970 --> 01:33:16,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's Odile. Hey, Odile.

1537

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Finally someone has given me what I want.

1539
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:31,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I'm not fired.

1540
01:33:32,570 --> 01:33:33,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wow!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you crazy? Then we'll be further apart.

1545
