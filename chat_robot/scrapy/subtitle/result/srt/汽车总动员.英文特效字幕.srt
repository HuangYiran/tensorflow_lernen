3
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Speed. I am speed.

4
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}One winner, 42 losers.

5
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I eat losers for breakfast.

6
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Breakfast.

7
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Wait, maybe I should have had breakfast.

8
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}A little breck-y could be good for me. No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

9
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm faster than fast. Quicker than quick.

10
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I am lightning!

11
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, Lightning! You ready?

12
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready

13
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ka-chow!

14
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,710

15
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Go, Lightnin'!

16
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Whoo! - You got that right, slick.

17
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.

18
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm Bob Cutlass, here with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

19
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}We're midway through what may be an historic day for racing.

20
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Bob, my oil pressure's through the roof.

21
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}If this gets more exciting, they're gonna have to tow me outta the booth!

22
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Right, Darrell.

23
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Three cars are tied for the season points lead,

24
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}heading into the final race of the season.

25
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}And the winner of this race will win the season title and the Piston Cup.

26
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Does The King, Strip Weathers,

27
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}have one more victory in him before retirement?

28
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He's been Dinoco's golden boy for years!

29
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Can he win them one last Piston Cup?

30
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}And, as always, in the second place spot we find Chick Hicks.

31
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He's been chasing that tailfin his entire career.

32
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Chick thought this was his year.

33
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}His chance to finally emerge from The King's shadow.

34
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}But the last thing he expected was... Lightning McQueen!

35
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You know, I don't think anybody expected this.

36
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}The rookie sensation came into the season unknown.

37
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}But everyone knows him now.

38
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:24,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Will he be the first rookie to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?

39
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}The legend, the runner-up, and the rookie!

40
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Three cars, one champion!

41
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No you don't.

42
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey!

43
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What a ride!

44
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Go get 'em, McQueen! Go get 'em!

45
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I love you, Lightning!

46
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Dinoco is all mine.

47
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Trouble, turn three!

48
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Get through that, McQueen. - Huge crash behind the leaders!

49
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Wait a second, Darrell. McQueen is in the wreckage.

50
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}There's no way the rookie can make it through!

51
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Not in one piece, that is.

52
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah!

53
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Lightning! Oh!

54
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Look at that! McQueen made it through!

55
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}A spectacular move by Lightning McQueen!

56
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah! Ka-chow!

57
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

58
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow!

59
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}While everyone heads into the pits,

60
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}McQueen stays out to take the lead!

61
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Don't take me out, coach. I can still race!

62
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What do you think? A thing of beauty.

63
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- McQueen made it! - What?

64
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He's not pitting!

65
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You gotta get me out there! Let's go! Get me back out there!

66
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}McQueen's not going into the pits!

67
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}The rookie fired his crew chief. The third this season!

68
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Says he likes working alone. - Go, go!

69
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Looks like Chick got caught up in the pits.

70
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah, after a stop like that, he's got a lot of ground to make up.

71
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Get ready, boys, we're coming to the restart!

72
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Come on, come on, come on!

73
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}We need tires now! Come on, let's go!

74
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas! - What?

75
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You need tires, you idiot!

76
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Looks like it's gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

77
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Right. No tires again.

78
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}That's a short-term gain, long-term loss,

79
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}but it's workin' for him. He obviously knows somethin' we don't know.

80
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}This is it, Darrell. One lap to go and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

81
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He's got it in the bag. Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

82
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}We're gonna crown us a new champion!

83
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Checkered flag, here I come!

84
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No! McQueen's blown a tire!

85
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}And with only one turn to go! Can he make it?

86
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You fool!

87
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}McQueen's blown a tire! He's blown a tire!

88
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Go, go, go!

89
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He's lost another tire!

90
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- King and Chick come up fast! - They're entering turn three!

91
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Come on.

92
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I don't believe what I'm watching, Bob!

93
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Lightning McQueen is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

94
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}The King and Chick rounding turn four.

95
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Down the stretch they come! And it's, and it's...

96
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- It's too close to call! Too close! - I don't believe it!

97
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Lightning!

98
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- The most spectacular, amazing... - I don't believe it!

99
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}...unequivocally, unbelievable ending in the history of the world!

100
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- And we don't know who won! - Look at that!

101
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- That's very close to call. - Can we play that again?

102
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

103
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}We're here in Victory Lane, awaiting the results.

104
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}McQueen, that was a risky move, not taking tires.

105
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Tell me about it!

106
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Are you sorry you didn't have a crew chief out there?

107
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing than just winning.

108
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I mean, taking the race by a full lap... Where's the entertainment in that?

109
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.

110
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Sizzle? - Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?

111
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, I'm not. 'Cause I'm a one-man show.

112
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What? Oh, yeah, right.

113
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}That was a confident Lightning McQueen.

114
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Live from Victory Lane, I'm Kori Turbowitz.

115
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Get outta the shot. - Yo, Chuck.

116
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Chuck, what are you doing? You're blockin' the camera!

117
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Everyone wants to see the bolt. - What?

118
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Now, back away. - That's it! Come on, guys.

119
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:10,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Whoa, team! Where are you going? - We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

120
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

121
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}How will I ever find anyone else who knows how to fill me up with gas?

122
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Adios, Chuck! - And my name is not Chuck!

123
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, whatever.

124
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

125
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:27,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Seriously, that was some pretty darn nice racin' out there.

126
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- By me! - Oh, yeah.

127
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Zinger! - Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

128
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}The Piston Cup... It's mine, dude. It's mine.

129
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, fellas, how do you think I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

130
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}In your dreams, Thunder.

131
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah, right. Thunder? What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

132
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:47,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You know, 'cause thunder always comes after lightning.

133
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

134
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Who knew about the thunder thing? - I didn't.

135
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Give us the bolt! - That's right.

136
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Right in the lens.

137
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Show me the bolt, baby! - Smile, McQueen!

138
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Show me the bolt, McQueen! - That's it!

139
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}That was one close finish. You sure made Dinoco proud.

140
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Thank you, King.

141
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, Tex, you've been good to me all these years.

142
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}It's the least I could do.

143
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Whatever happens, you're a winner to me, you old daddy rabbit.

144
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Thanks, dear. Wouldn't be nothing without you.

145
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Kch-i-ka-chow!

146
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- I'm Mia. - I'm Tia.

147
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}We're, like, your biggest fans! Ka-chow!

148
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I love being me.

149
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- OK, girls, that's it. - We love you, Lightning!

150
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, buddy. You're one gutsy racer.

151
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, hey, Mr. The King.

152
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You got more talent in one lug nut

153
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}than a lot of cars has got in their whole body.

154
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Really? Oh, that... - But you're stupid.

155
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Excuse me? - This ain't a one-man deal, kid.

156
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You need to wise up and get a good crew chief and a good team.

157
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You ain't gonna win unless you got good folks behind you,

158
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}and you let them do their job, like they should.

159
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Like I tell the boys at the shop... - A good team.

160
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah...

161
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ka-chow! Ka-pow!

162
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, Lightning!

163
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}If you figure that out you just gonna be OK.

164
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, yeah, that... That is spectacular advice.

165
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Thank you, Mr. The King.

166
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ladies and gentlemen,

167
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}for the first time in Piston Cup history...

168
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:55,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}A rookie has won the Piston Cup.

169
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yes!

170
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}... we have a three-way tie.

171
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, that must be really embarrassing.

172
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}But I wouldn't worry about it. Because I didn't do it!

173
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Piston Cup officials have determined that a tiebreaker race

174
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}between the three leaders will be held in California in one week.

175
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, thank you! Thanks to all of you out there! Thank you!

176
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, first one to California gets Dinoco all to himself.

177
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:31,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, not me! No, you rock, and you know that!

178
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, yeah! Whoo!

179
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yep! All right! Got it!

180
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}"First one to California gets Dinoco all to himself."

181
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, we'll see who gets there first, Chick.

182
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Hey, kid! Congrats on the tie. - I don't want to talk about it.

183
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Let's go, Mack. Saddle up. What'd you do with my trailer?

184
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- I parked it at your sponsor's tent. - What?

185
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Gotta make your personal appearance.

186
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No. No! No, no, no, no!

187
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yes, yes, yes! Lightning McQueen here.

188
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}And I use Rust-eze Medicated Bumper Ointment, new rear end formula!

189
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Nothing soothes a rusty bumper like Rust-eze.

190
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Wow! Look at that shine!

191
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Use Rust-eze and you too can look like me!

192
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ka-chow!

193
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I met this car from Swampscott.

194
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He was so rusty he didn't even cast a shadow.

195
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You could see his dirty undercarriage.

196
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:35,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I hate rusty cars. This is not good for my image.

197
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}They did give you your big break. Besides, it's in your contract.

198
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, will you stop, please? Just go get hooked up.

199
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Winter is a grand old time. - Of this there are no ifs or buts.

200
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}But remember, all that salt and grime...

201
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Can rust your bolts and freeze your...

202
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, look! There he is!

203
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Our almost champ!

204
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Get your rear end in here.

205
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Lightning McQueen, you are wicked fast!

206
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- That race was a pisser! - You were booking!

207
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Give me a little room. - You're my hero!

208
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yes, I know.

209
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}"Fred." Fred, thank you.

210
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He knows my name. He knows my name!

211
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Looking good, Freddie!

212
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Thanks to you, Lightning, we had a banner year!

213
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}We might clear enough to buy you some headlights.

00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}We're live at the Los Angeles International Speedway

313
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}as the first competitor, Lightning McQueen,

315
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Is it true he's gonna pose for Cargirl?

316
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What's your strategy?

317
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What? Did I forget to wipe my mud flaps?

318

{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}McQueen's driver arrived in California, but McQueen was missing.

319

321
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:50,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I hope Lightning's OK. I'd hate to see anything bad happen to him.

322
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I don't know what's harder to find, McQueen or a chief who'll work with him!

323
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:58,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Lightning McQueen must be found at all costs!

324
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}They're all asking the same question: Where is McQueen?

325
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, boy.

326
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Where am I?

327
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Mornin', sleepin' beauty! - Ah!

328
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Boy, I was wonderin' when you was gonna wake up.

329
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Take whatever you want! Just don't hurt me!

330
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}A parking boot? Why do I have a parking boot on?

331
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:24,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- What's going on here? Please! - You're funny.

332
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I like you already. My name's Mater.

333
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Mater?

334
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah, like "tuh-mater," but without the "tuh".

335
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- What's your name? - You don't know my name?

336
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Uh...

337
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, I know your name. Is your name Mater too?

338
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What?

339
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Look, I need to get to California as fast as possible. Where am I?

340
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Where are you? Shoot!

341
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You're in Radiator Springs.

342
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}The cutest little town in Carburetor County.

343
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, great. Just great!

344
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:02,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, if you think that's great, you should see the rest of the town.

345
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You know, I'd love to see the rest of the town!

346
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}So if you could just open the gate, take this boot off,

347
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}you and me, we go cruisin', check out the local scene...

348
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Dad-gum! - How'd that be, Tuhmater?

349
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Cool! - Mater!

350
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What did I tell you about talkin' to the accused?

351
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}To not to.

352
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:25,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, quit your yappin' and tow this delinquent road hazard to traffic court.

353
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, we'll talk later, Mater.

354
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}"Later, Mater." That's funny!

355
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:35,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}The Radiator Springs Traffic Court will come to order!

356
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, you scratched my paint! I oughta take a blowtorch to you, man!

357
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You broke-a the road! You a very bad car!

358
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Fascist! - Commie!

359
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Officer, talk to me, babe. How long is this gonna take?

360
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I gotta get to California, pronto.

361
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Where's your lawyer?

362
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:51,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I don't know. Tahiti maybe. He's got a timeshare there.

363
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:56,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}When a defendant has no lawyer, the court will assign one to him. Hey!

364
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Anyone want to be his lawyer?

365
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Shoot, I'll do it, Sheriff!

366
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}All rise! The Honorable Doc Hudson presiding.

367
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:07,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Show-off.

368
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- May Doc have mercy on your soul.

369
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}-  - All right,

370
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I wanna know who's responsible for wreckin' my town, Sheriff.

371
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I want his hood on a platter!

372
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots! No, check that.

373
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:24,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm gonna put him in jail till the jail rots on top of him,

374
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}and then I'm gonna move him to a new jail and let that jail rot.

375
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm...

376
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

377
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I want him out of my courtroom. I want him out of our town!

378
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Case dismissed. - Yes!

379
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Boy, I'm purty good at this lawyerin' stuff.

380
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Sorry I'm late, Your Honor!

381
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Holy Porsche! She's gotta be from my attorney's office.

382
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, thanks for comin', but we're all set.

383
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- He's letting me go. - He's letting you go?

384
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

385
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}All you have to do now is stand there and let me look at you.

386
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:01,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Listen, I'm gonna cut to the chase. Me, you, dinner. Pi-cha-kow!

387
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- What the...? Ow! Oh! - Ka-chow!

388
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Please! - I know. I get that reaction a lot.

389
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:10,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I create feelings in others that they themselves don't understand.

390
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

391
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}A little bit, but I'll be all right.

392
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

393
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Do what you gotta do, baby. But listen. Be careful.

394
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Folks around here are not firing on all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

395
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ka-ching!

396
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'll keep that in mind.

397
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Hey there, Mater. - Howdy, Sally.

398
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Hi, folks! - Good morning!

399
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You know her?

400
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}She's the town attorney and my fiancee.

401
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What?

402
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Nah, I'm just kiddin'. She just likes me for my body.

403
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:51,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You look great. You do something different with your side view mirrors?

404
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What do you want, Sally?

405
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}[Sighing] Come on, make this guy fix the road. The town needs this.

406
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No. I know his type. Racecar.

407
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}That's the last thing this town needs.

408
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}OK, I didn't want to have to do this, Doc, but you leave me no choice.

409
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Fellow citizens, you're all aware of our town's proud history.

410
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Here she goes again.

411
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Radiator Springs, the glorious jewel

412
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}strung on the necklace of Route 66, the mother road!

413
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}It is our job and our pleasure to take care of the travelers

414
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- on our stretch of that road. - Travelers? What travelers?

415
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ignore him.

416
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}But how, I ask you, are we to care for those travelers

417
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}if there is no road for them to drive on?

418
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Luigi, what do you have at your store? - Tires.

419
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}And if no one can get to you?

420
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I won't sell any... tires. I will lose everything!

421
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Flo, what do you have at your store? - I have gas.

422
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Lotsa gas! - OK boys, stay with me.

423
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}And, Flo, what'll happen if no one can come to your station to buy gas?

424
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'll go outta business and... we'll have to leave town.

425
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:58,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What's gonna happen if Flo leaves town and closes her station?

426
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}-  Without gas, we're done for! - What?

427
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Don't you think the car responsible should fix our road?

428
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:06,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}The only guy strong enough to fix that road is Big Al!

429
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

430
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Then why are you bringing him up, you lemon?

431
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, he can do it.

432
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He's got the horsepower. So, what do you want him to do?

433
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Fix the road!

434
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:20,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Because we are a town worth fixing! - Yeah!

435
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:25,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}[Honking] Order in the court!

436
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Seems like my mind has been changed for me.

437
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}-  Yeah! - No!

438
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}[VW van] Nice ruling.

439
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:36,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

440
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:40,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}That's OK, Stickers. You can take Bessie.

441
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Man, you get to work with Bessie!

442
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'd give my left two lug nuts for somethin' like that.

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Bessie? Who's Bessie?

444
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:53,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}This here is Bessie, finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm hereby sentencing you to community service.

446
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You're gonna fix the road under my supervision.

447
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What? This place is crazy!

448
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I know this may be a bad time right now,

449
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}but you owe me $32,000 in legal fees.

450
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What?

451
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie, and you're gonna pull her nice.

452
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You gotta be kidding me.

453
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You start there where the road begins.

454
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You finish down there where the road ends.

455
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Holy shoot!

456
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Whoa, whoa, whoa! How long is this gonna take?

457
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, fella does it right, should take him about five days.

458
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Five days?

459
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}But I should be in California schmoozing Dinoco right now!

460
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Then if I were you, I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

461
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Hook him up, Mater. - Okay-dokey.

462
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Freedom!

463
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Maybe I should've hooked him up to Bessie...

464
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}...and then... then took the boot off.

465
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Whoo-hoo!

472
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}How can I be outta gas?

475
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,390

{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Guido! - Red, can you move over?

482
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I want to get a look at that sexy hot rod.

483

{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You know, I used to be a purty good whistler.

484
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I can't do it now, of course, on account of sometimes

485

{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}but Doc said he's gonna fix it. He can fix about anything.

487
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}That's why we made him the judge.

488

500
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I shouldn't put up with this.

501
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm a precision instrument of speed and aerodynamics.

00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Customers.

00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Been a long time. Remember what we rehearsed.

518
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Make sure your "Open, please come in" signs are out.

519
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You all know what to do. All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Van, I just don't see any on-ramp anywhere.

521
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:07,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Minny, I know exactly where we are. - Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

522
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Honey, please. -  Hello.

526
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- We don't need anything, thank you. - Ask for directions to the Interstate.

527
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}There's no need to ask for directions. I know where we're going.

528
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He did the same thing on our trip to Shakopee.

529
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}We were headed over there for the Crazy Days, and we...

530
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK? - What you really need

531
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}is the sweet taste of my homemade, organic fuel.

532
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

533
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Just trying to find the Interstate. - Good to see you, soldier!

534
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut for your government surplus needs.

535
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Honey, surplus! - We have too much surplus.

536
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I do have a map over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

537
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}And if you stay, we offer a free Lincoln Continental breakfast.

538
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Honey, she's got a map. - I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

539
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Never need a map again, thank you. - How 'bout somethin' to drink?

540
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Stop at Flo's V-Eight Cafe. Finest fuel on Route 66.

541
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No we just topped off.

542
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}And if you need tires, stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

543
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

544
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:15,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- We're trying to find the Interstate. - But you do need a paint job.

545
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:18,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ramone will paint you up right. Hey, anything you want!

546
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- You know, like a flame job. - No thanks...

547
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Maybe ghost flames!

548
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You like old school pinstripin'? Von Dutch style?

549
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:29,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

550
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:32,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}OK, no. We're gonna be going now, OK?

551
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ow!

552
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}A little somethin' to remember us by, OK?

553
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- OK! - Come back soon, OK?

554
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I mean, you know where we are! Tell your friends!

555
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}OK! Yes. You bet.

556
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Thanks again, folks. Bye-bye now.

557
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Psst! Psst! Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

558
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- I know how to get to the Interstate! - Do ya?

559
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Minny, no. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

560
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, not really. But listen.

561
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar. I'm being held against my will.

562
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I need you to call my team, so they can come rescue me

563
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}and get me to California in time for me to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

564
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

565
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, it's the truth! I'm telling you! You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

566
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm in hillbilly hell! My IQ's dropping by the second!

567
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm becoming one of them!

568
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:25,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}OK, don't worry. They know where we are now.

569
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:27,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}They'll tell friends. You'll see.

570
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}We'll be back for our Hank Williams marathon...

571
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- That's good. ...after a Piston Cup update.

572
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Still no sign of Lightning McQueen. Chick arrived in California

573
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}and today became the first car to spend practice time on the track.

574
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:43,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}It's nice to get out here before the other competitors.

575
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:47,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You know, get a head start. Gives me an edge.

576
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hoo-hoo-hoo!

577
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:58,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ha-ha!

578
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:03,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah!

579
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, McQueen... Eat your heart out.

580
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Let me get this straight.

581
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I can go when this road is done. That's the deal, right?

582
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- That's what they done did said. - OK. Outta my way.

583
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I got a road to finish.

584
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- He's done! - Done?

585
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Uh-huh. - It's only been an hour.

586
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:51,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

587
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:54,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Say thanks, and I'll be on my way. That's all you gotta say.

588
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Whee-hoo! I'm the first one on the new road!

589
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}It rides purty smooth.

590
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- It looks awful! - Well, it matches the rest of the town.

591
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Red.

592
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Who do you think you are?

593
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Look, Doc said when I finish, I could go. That was the deal.

594
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:25,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}The deal was you fix the road, not make it worse.

595
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Now, scrape it off! Start over again.

596
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:31,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, look, grandpa, I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

597
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh-ho-ho-ho!

598
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Is that right? Then why don't we just have a little race? Me and you.

599
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- What? -  Me and you. That a joke?

600
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}If you win, you go and I fix the road.

601
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:46,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}If I win, you do the road my way.

602
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Doc, what're you doin'?

603
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I don't mean to be rude here,

604
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}but you probably go zero to sixty in, like, what? Three-point-five years?

605
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Then I reckon you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

606
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:01,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You know what, old-timer? That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

607
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Gentlemen, this will be a one-lap race.

608
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:10,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You will drive to Willy's Butte, go around Willy's Butte and come back.

609
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:13,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}There will be no bumpin', no cheatin', no spittin',

610
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

611
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:20,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin', no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

612
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}and no lollygaggin'.

613
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Speed. I'm speed.

614
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:27,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer.

615
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:33,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}My friend Guido, he dream to give a real racecar a pit stop.

616
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:35,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Peet stop! - Uh...

617
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:38,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}The race is only one lap, guys.

618
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Uno lappo! Don't need any help.

619
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:45,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- I work solo mio. - Fine. Race your way.

620
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:50,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- No pit stoppo. Comprendo? - OK.

621
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Gentlemen...

622
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}...start your engines!

623
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Hijole! Check that out! - Whoa.

624
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Great idea, Doc. Now the road will never get done.

625
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:09,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Luigi?

626
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}On your mark, get set...

627
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:15,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Uno for the money, due for the show,

628
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:21,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}tre to get ready, and quattro to... I can't believe it. Go!

629
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Doc... the flag means go.

630
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Remember the fl... Here we go. Go.

631
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Doc, what are you doing, man?

632
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:43,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, dear. It would seem I'm off to a poor start.

633
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, better late than never. Come on, Mater.

634
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:50,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Might need a little help. - Uh... OK.

635
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You got your tow cable?

636
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, yeah, I always got my tow cable. Why?

637
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:57,810

647
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:45,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

648
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I can make a little turn on dirt.

649
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You think?

650
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:56,600

653
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- That freak juice? -  Pass.

654
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:09,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty. Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

661
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:42,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Hate, hate, hate, hate it! - Music. Sweet music.

662
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:45,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

663
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Radiator Springs, a happy place!

672
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I haven't seen a road like this in years.

673
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Well, then let's cruise, baby. - Low and slow.

674
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:39,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}E bellissima! It's beautiful!

675
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Guido, look, it's-a like it was paved by angels.

676
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:45,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Boy, I tell you what.

677
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:48,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I bet even the roads on the moon ain't this smooth.

678
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Doc, look at this!

679
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Shoulda tossed him into the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

680
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:56,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, he ain't finished yet. Still got a long way to go.

681
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:59,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Guido, look at Luigi!

682
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}This is fantastico!

683
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}That looks like fun! Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

684
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:09,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, Luigi, this new road makes your place look like a dump.

685
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:13,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}That crazy old devil woman.

686
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}[Sighs] Oh!

687
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:18,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}She's right!

688
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:20,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Ah! - Guido!

689
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:24,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

690
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, now... where the heck is he?

691
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:38,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Sheriff! Is he makin' another run for it?

692
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:41,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, no. He ran outta asphalt in the middle of the night,

693
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:44,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}and asked me if he could come down here.

694
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}All he's tryin' to do is make that there turn.

695
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:49,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

696
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Perfect turns on every track I've ever raced on.

697
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:58,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself a quart of oil at Flo's.

698
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:00,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'll keep an eye on him.

699
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, thanks, Doc. I've been feelin' a quart low.

700
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

701
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, great. What do you want? You here to gloat?

702
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:27,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You don't have three-wheel brakes, so you got to pitch it hard,

703
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:30,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}break it loose and then just drive it with the throttle.

704
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Give it too much, you'll be outta the dirt and into the tulips.

705
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}So you're a judge, a doctor and a racing expert.

706
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'll put it simple.

707
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}If you're goin' hard enough left, you'll find yourself turnin' right.

708
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense. Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

709
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:51,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

710
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:55,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Because in Opposite World, maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

711
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

712
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:10,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Turn right to go left.

713
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:14,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hmm...

714
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Whoa!

715
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:23,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Ow! Oh, that...

716
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:33,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Turn right to go left. Guess what. I tried it.

717
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You know what? This crazy thing happened... I went right!

718
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:39,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You keep talkin' to yourself, people'll think you're crazy.

719
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Thanks for the tip. - What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

720
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:54,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo! - Che cosa?

721
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:58,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- It looks great! This is great! - Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.

722
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, Lord.

723
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:05,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}-  -  Mater!

724
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I need you to watch the prisoner tonight.

725
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:10,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute. What if he tries to run again?

726
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Just let him run outta gas and tow him on back.

727
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- But keep an eye on him. - Yes, sir!

728
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:18,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh...

729
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}While I'm stuck here paving this stinkin' road,

730
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

731
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Who's touching me?

732
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

733
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You make-a such a nice new road.

734
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:34,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You come to my shop. Luigi take-a good care of you.

735
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Even though you not a Ferrari.

736
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:40,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You buy four tires, I give you a full-a size spare

737
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- absolutely free! - Look, I get all my tires for free.

738
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:48,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I like your style, eh?

739
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You drive the hard bargain. OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

740
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You buy one tire, I give you three for free!

741
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:57,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, would you look at that?

742
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:59,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ramone, Ramone!

743
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:01,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Then Luigi make you a new new deal.

744
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:04,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, no, no, no. Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

745
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:08,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- No, no, no, no. No. - This is it. My last offer.

746
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:13,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You buy one tire, I give you seven-a snow tires for free!

747
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Done. You interested, you call me. You know where I am.

748
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:20,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Stop! Let me...

749
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, Red, you missed a spot. See it right there?

750
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:27,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- No! No! - On the hood right there.

751
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:30,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Stop, stop! That's cold!

752
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Help! Please! Stop!

753
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:36,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Thanks, Red.

754
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:38,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What was that for?

755
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone? - Huh?

756
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}If you do, you gotta be clean.

757
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:45,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}'Cause even in hillbilly hell we have standards.

758
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What, I...? I don't get it.

759
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I thought I'd say thank you for doin' a great job.

760
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:53,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}So I thought I'd let you stay with me. I mean, not with me!

761
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:57,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}But there. Not with me there, but there in your own cozy cone.

762
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:01,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- And I'd be in my cone, and it's... - Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

763
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:04,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}If you want to stay at the dirty impound, fine.

764
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- I understand you criminal types. - No, no, no, no. That's OK.

765
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Yeah, the Cozy Cone. -  It's newly refurbished.

766
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:14,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah, it's like a clever little twist.

767
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:18,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}The motel's made out of caution cones, which, of course, cars try to avoid.

768
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:22,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}But now we're gonna stay in them. That's funny.

769
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Figure that all out on your own, did you?

770
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:29,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Cone number one, if you want.

771
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, do I spy a little pinstriping tattoo back there?

772
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh...  That's just a... Oh!

773
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, you saw that? Yeah. Just gonna be going.

774
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Gonna... Yeah.

775
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:56,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- You know, I knew this girl Doreen. -

776
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Good-lookin' girl.

777
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:01,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Looked just like a Jaguar, only she was a truck!

778
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:05,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You know, I used to crash into her, just so I could spoke to her.

779
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- What are you talking about? - I don't know.

780
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight, 'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

781
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, Mater, I gotta finish this road, and I have to get out of here.

782
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, that's all right, Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

783
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

784
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

785
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You know who you're talkin' to? This is Lightning McQueen.

786
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I can handle anything.

787
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:35,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- I'm not doin' this. - Come on. You'll love it!

788
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:39,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}-  Tractor-tippin's fun. -  This is ridiculous.

789
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:41,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}All right, listen.

790
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:45,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}When I say go, we go. But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

791
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

792
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:50,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Mater!

793
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:52,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Wait, Mater!

794
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}OK, here's what you do.

795
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:58,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You just sneak up in front of 'em, and then honk.

796
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:01,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}And they do the rest. Watch this.

797
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:25,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I swear, tractors is so dumb!

798
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:29,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I tell you what, buddy, it don't get much better than this.

799
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:32,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

800
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:48,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I don't care who you are, that's funny right there.

801
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, your turn, bud.

802
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Mater, I can't. I don't even have a horn.

803
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Baby. - I'm not a baby.

804
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:59,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Fine. Stop! Stop, OK? All right. I'll do something.

805
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:52,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}That's Frank.

806
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:14,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Run!

807
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:16,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Here he comes, look out!

808
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Run! He's gonna get ya!

809
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh! Customers!

810
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh!

811
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ah, no, no, no.

812
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:53,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oof! Oh!

813
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Tomorrow night we can go look for the ghostlight!

814
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:01,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- I can't wait, Mater. - Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

815
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:05,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, boy, you gotta admit that was fun!

816
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:07,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, yeah... yeah.

817
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, we better get you back to the impound lot.

818
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You know, actually, Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

819
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:20,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we? - Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

820
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Besides, she can't stand me. And I don't like her, to be honest.

821
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:28,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah, you probably right. Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

822
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:31,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Where, where?

823
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:34,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- You're in love with Miss Sally. - No, I'm not.

824
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}-  Yes, you do. -  No way.

825
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:37,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Way. - Come on, look...

826
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- You're in love with Miss Sally! - Real mature.

827
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:41,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- You're in love! - Real grown up.

828
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:43,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- You love her. You love her. - Wait...

829
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You love her! You love her. You love her.

830
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}All right. OK. Mater, enough!

831
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:49,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Will you stop that? - Stop what?

832
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:52,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Driving backwards. It's creeping me out. You're gonna wreck.

833
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Wreck? Shoot! I'm the world's best backwards driver!

834
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:01,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You just watch this right here, lover boy. Wee-hee!

835
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What are you doing? Watch out! Look out!

836
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Mater? Mater!

837
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Mater!

838
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, take it easy, Mater!

839
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:28,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oof!

840
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:31,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yee-hee!

841
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He's nuts.

842
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No need to watch where I'm goin'.

843
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Just need to know where I've been.

844
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:45,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Whoa, that was incredible! How'd you do that?

845
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:49,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Rearview mirrors. We'll get you some, and I'll teach you if you want.

846
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah, maybe I'll use it in my big race.

847
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:56,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What's so important about this race of yours, anyway?

848
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:01,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}It's not just a race. We're talking about the Piston Cup!

849
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:04,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I've been dreaming about it my whole life!

850
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:07,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'll be the first rookie in history ever to win it.

851
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:10,730

853
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:15,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No more medicated bumper ointment. No more rusty old cars.

854
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What's wrong with rusty old cars?

865
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:01,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}McQueen and Sally parked beneath a tree,

866
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:05,320

879
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:49,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}First things first. I gotta get outta here and make the race.

931
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:12,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, but I wish I could have. They say he was amazing!

932
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:16,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- He won three Piston Cups! - He did what in his cup?

936
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:26,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}-  Are you sick, buddy? - You are lookin' peaked.

937
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:27,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He needs a new coat of poly for sure!

938
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:33,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}-  Hey! What are you doin'? - It's OK. You can trust me, right?

947
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He actually thought Doc was a famous racecar!

01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:38,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Wow. What is this place?

953
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:40,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Wheel Well.

954
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:43,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Used to be the most popular stop on the mother road.

955
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}This place?

956
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:55,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah, imagine.

957
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:00,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, imagine what it must have been like to stay here.

958
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:04,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You know, I don't get you.

959
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}How does a Porsche wind up in a place like this?

960
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, it's really pretty simple. I was...

961
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:14,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}...an attorney in LA livin' life in the fast lane, and...

962
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:17,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, you were, were you? Were you rich?

963
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:21,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- What? - Just... clues to the puzzle.

964
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah, OK. Well, that was my life.

965
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}And you know what?

966
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:30,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}It never felt... happy.

967
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:34,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah. I mean... really?

968
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah. So I left California.

969
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:40,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Just drove and drove and finally broke down right here.

970
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:43,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Doc fixed me up, Flo took me in.

971
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, they all did. And I never left.

972
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah. You know, I understand.

973
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:52,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You need a little R and R. Recharge the old batteries.

974
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:56,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}But you know, after a while, why didn't you go back?

975
01:10:57,250 --> 01:11:00,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I fell in love.

976
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:04,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Oh. - Yep.

977
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:08,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Corvette? - No.

978
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:16,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I fell in love with this.

979
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:32,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Whoa. Look at that.

980
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:35,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Look, they're drivin' right by.

981
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}They don't even know what they're missing!

982
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:40,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, it didn't used to be that way.

983
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:43,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, yeah?

984
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:47,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah. Forty years ago, that Interstate down there didn't exist.

985
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:49,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Really?

986
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:52,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah. Back then,

987
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}cars came across the country a whole different way.

988
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}How do you mean?

989
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:01,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}The road didn't cut through the land like that Interstate.

990
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:05,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}It moved with the land, you know? It rose, it fell, it curved.

991
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:09,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Mornin'! - Nice day, huh?

992
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:14,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Cars didn't drive on it to make great time.

993
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:16,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}They drove on it to have a great time.

994
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, what happened?

995
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:56,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}The town got bypassed just to save ten minutes of driving.

996
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:26,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}How great would it have been to see this place in its heyday!

997
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:29,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, I can't tell you how many times I've dreamed of that.

998
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:33,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}But one of these days we'll find a way to get it back on the map.

999
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:36,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drive.

1000
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:38,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I had a great time.

1001
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:41,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}It's kinda nice to slow down every once in a while.

1002
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:44,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You're welcome.

1003
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:52,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, listen, listen!

1004
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:56,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}If anybody asks you, we was out smashin' mailboxes, OK?

1005
01:14:56,190 --> 01:14:58,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Wha... what?

1006
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:15,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, man, the paint's still wet!

1007
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:28,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, no, no, no! Get out of the store!

1008
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:31,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey! Don't eat the radial! Here, take-a the snow tires.

1009
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:34,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}-  Mater! - I wasn't tractor-tippin'!

1010
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:37,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Then where did all these gol-durn tractors come from?

1011
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:39,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Whoa, boy! - Hey! Hey, guys!

1012
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:41,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}There's one goin' this way.

1013
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:45,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I got it.

1014
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:50,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Come here, little tractor, come here.

1015
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:53,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah, that's a good tractor.

1016
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, no, no, no, come here.

1017
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What are you doing?

1018
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:58,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You're not supposed to go wandering off all...

1019
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:01,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}...alone.

1020
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:16,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What are you doin' with those old racin' tires?

1021
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:25,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Come on, Doc, drive.

1022
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:44,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ah... Yeah.

1023
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:46,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Wow. - Huh?

1024
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:48,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You're amazing!

1025
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What are you doin'?

1026
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Doc, wait!

1027
01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:00,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Giddup right in there! Come on, Rusty.

1028
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:06,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Doc, hold it! Seriously, your driving's incredible!

1029
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Wonderful. Now, go away. - Hey, I mean it. You've still got it!

1030
01:18:10,050 --> 01:18:11,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- I'm askin' you to leave. - Come on.

1031
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:14,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm a racecar, you're a much older racecar,

1032
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:17,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}but under the hood you and I are the same.

1033
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:20,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}We are not the same! Understand? Now, get out.

1034
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:23,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?

1035
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:27,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You think I quit?

1036
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Right.

1037
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:45,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Your big wreck in '54.

1038
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:48,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}They quit on me.

1039
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:51,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}When I finally got put together, I went back expecting a big welcome.

1040
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:54,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You know what they said? "You're history."

1041
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Moved right on to the next rookie standing in line.

1042
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:02,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}There was a lot left in me.

1043
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:06,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I never got a chance to show 'em.

1044
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:12,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I keep that to remind me never to go back.

1045
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:16,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I just never expected that that world would...

1046
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:18,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}...would find me here.

1047
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:22,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them. - Oh, yeah?

1048
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, I'm not.

1049
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:27,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}When is the last time you cared about something except yourself, hot rod?

1050
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:32,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You name me one time and I will take it all back.

1051
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:36,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Uh-huh. I didn't think so.

1052
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:41,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}These are good folk around here, who care about one another.

1053
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:44,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I don't want 'em depending on someone they can't count on.

1054
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, like you? You've been here how long

1055
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:49,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}and your friends don't even know who you are?

1056
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Who's caring about only himself?

1057
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:55,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Just finish that road and get outta here!

1058
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:12,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?

1059
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:14,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Respect the classics, man.

1060
01:20:41,230 --> 01:20:42,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He's done.

1061
01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:45,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He must've finished it while we was all sleepin'.

1062
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:48,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Good riddance.

1063
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He's gone?

1064
01:20:57,580 --> 01:21:00,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, we wouldn't want him to miss that race of his.

1065
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:10,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Oh, dude, are you crying? - No! I'm happy!

1066
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:13,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I don't have to watch him every second of the day anymore!

1067
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm glad he's gone!

1068
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:23,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What's wrong with Red?

1069
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:26,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, he's just sad 'cause you left town

1070
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:29,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}and went to your big race to win the Piston Cup

1071
01:21:29,650 --> 01:21:32,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}that you've always dreamed about your whole life

1072
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:38,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}and get that big ol' sponsor and that fancy helicopter you was talkin' about.

1073
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Wait a minute!

1074
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:49,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I knowed you wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.

1075
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:52,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What are you doin' here? You're gonna miss your race.

1076
01:21:52,170 --> 01:21:55,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Don't worry. I'll give you a police escort, and we'll make up time.

1077
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:57,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Thank you, Sheriff.

1078
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:59,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}But you know I can't go just yet.

1079
01:21:59,350 --> 01:22:00,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, why not?

1080
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:03,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm not sure these tires...

1081
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:06,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}...can get me to California. - Peet stop?

1082
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:10,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah, does anybody know what time Luigi's opens?

1083
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:13,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I can't-a believe it! Four new tires!

1084
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:16,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Grazie, Mr. Lightning. Grazie!

1085
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:20,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Would you look at that! -  Our first customer in years!

1086
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:23,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I am filled with tears of ecstasy,

1087
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}for this is the most glorious day of my life!

1088
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:31,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}All right, Luigi, give me the best set of blackwalls you've got.

1089
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:33,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No! No, no, no.

1090
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:36,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You don't-a know what you want. Luigi know what you want.

1091
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:42,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Blackwall tires. They blend into the pavement.

1092
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:43,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}But-a this...

1093
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Whitewall tires!

1094
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:51,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}They say, "Look at me! Here I am! Love me."

1095
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}All right, you're the expert.

1096
01:22:53,170 --> 01:22:56,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Don't forget the spare.

1097
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:59,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Perfetto. Guido! - Peet stop!

1098
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:13,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What did Luigi tell you, eh?

1099
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:16,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Wow, you were right. Better than a Ferrari, huh?

1100
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:18,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Eh... No.

1101
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:26,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Wow! This organic fuel is great! Why haven't I heard about it before?

1102
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:28,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}It's a conspiracy, man!

1103
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}The oil companies got a grip on the government!

1104
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:34,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}They're feedin' us a bunch of lies, man.

1105
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}OK, I'll take a case.

1106
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:05,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ka-chow.

1107
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:09,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Here she comes! -  Places, everybody. Hurry!

1108
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:11,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Act natural.

1109
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:12,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Hi, Sally. - Buon giorno!

1110
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:14,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}All right, what's goin' on?

1111
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:16,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ladies and gentlecars,

1112
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:20,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}please welcome the new Lightning McQueen!

1113
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:23,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Pow! What do you think?

1114
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Radiator Springs looks pretty good on me.

1115
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:27,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'll say.

1116
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:30,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ka-chow.

1117
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:33,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You're gonna fit right in in California.

1118
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:37,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}My goodness. It looks like you've helped everybody in town.

1119
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:39,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah, everybody except one.

1120
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:45,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Hey, is it getting dark out? - What? What'd he say?

1121
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:48,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Let me say that again. Is it getting dark out?

1122
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:50,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Now, what was I supposed to do after that?

1123
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:17,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}They fixed their neon!

1124
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:29,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Low and slow? - Oh, yeah, baby!

1125
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:37,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Just like in its heyday, right?

1126
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:41,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}It's even better than I pictured it. Thank you.

1127
01:26:08,490 --> 01:26:09,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Shall we cruise?

1128
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

1129
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- No, no, no. - Lizzie!

1130
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:18,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I remember when Stanley first asked me to take a drive with him.

1131
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:21,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, Miss Sally. May I have this cruise?

1132
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:24,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Of course, Mater. - Uh-uh-uh!

1133
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:35,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}...and again and I said, "No." He asked me again, and I said, "No."

1134
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:39,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}But, oh, he was a persistent little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1135
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:43,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Finally I said, "All right, one little drive."

1136
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:55,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Hey! - Thanks, Mater.

1137
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:57,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Good evenin', you two.

1138
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:05,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, Stanley, I wish you could see this.

1139
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:13,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Is that what I think it is? - Oh, I don't know, Flo.

1140
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:18,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I haven't had a chance to find out. But I am going to find out. Hello.

1141
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:21,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Not that. That.

1142
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:23,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Customers?

1143
01:27:23,970 --> 01:27:26,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Customers, everybody! And a lot of 'em!

1144
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:28,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You know what to do. Just like we rehearsed.

1145
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:32,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}It's the ghostlight!

1146
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:35,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}We have found McQueen. We have found McQueen!

1147
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:37,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}McQueen, over here!

1148
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:40,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Wait, excuse me. - Is it true you've been in rehab?

1149
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Did you have a nervous breakdown? - What?

1150
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- McQueen's wearing whitewalls! - Your tires balding?

1151
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:46,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Stickers!

1152
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:48,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Was McQueen your prisoner? - Shoot, no!

1153
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:51,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}We're best buds! I ain't braggin' or nothin',

1154
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:54,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}but I was in charge of huntin' him down if he tried to escape.

1155
01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:56,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Sally! Sally!

1156
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:58,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

1157
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Stickers? - Sally!

1158
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Come on, give us some bolt!

1159
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:07,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You're here! Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

1160
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:10,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Mack? - You're here! I can't believe it!

1161
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:14,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You are a sight for sore headlights!

1162
01:28:14,650 --> 01:28:17,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm so sorry I lost you, boss. I'll make it up to you!

1163
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

1164
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:21,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Is that the world's fastest racing machine?

1165
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:24,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Is that Harv? - Yeah. He's in the back.

1166
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:29,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Show us the bolt! - Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1167
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:32,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Where's the old McQueen? - Actually, this is my good side here.

1168
01:28:32,770 --> 01:28:34,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Harv! Harv! - Give us the bolt!

1169
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:36,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Harv? - Come on!

1170
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:39,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Kid, I'm over here! - How you doin', buddy?

1171
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:42,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}My star client disappears off the face of the earth!

1172
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- How do you think I'm doing? - I can explain.

1173
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:48,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm doing great! You're everywhere! Radio, TV, the papers!

1174
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:52,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You can't buy this kind of publicity! What do you need me for?

1175
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:54,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}That's just a figure of speech, by the way. You signed a contract.

1176
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:57,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Where are you? I can't even find you on my GPS.

1177
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:59,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm in this little town called Radiator Springs.

1178
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:02,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- You know Route 66? It's still here! - Yeah, that's great, kid.

1179
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Playtime is over, pal.

1180
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:08,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}While the world's been trying to find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.

1181
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:09,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Who are they gonna woo? - Chick!

1182
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:13,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Bingo. In fact, check out what's on the plasma right now.

1183
01:29:13,610 --> 01:29:15,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Show us the thunder! - You want thunder?

1184
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:19,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You want thunder? Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!

1185
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:22,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Hey, that's my bit! - You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!

1186
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:26,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Just get out of Radiation Stinks now, or Dinoco is history, you hear me?

1187
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Just give me a second here, Harv.

1188
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:30,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, wait. Where are you goin'?

1189
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:33,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Get in the trailer, baby. Kid! You want a bigger trailer?

1190
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Sally, I... I want you to...

1191
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:44,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Look, I wish...

1192
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:48,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1193
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:56,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- It was just a road. - No. It was much more than that.

1194
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:02,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, kid! We gotta go. Harv's goin' crazy!

1195
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:05,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He's gonna have me fired if I don't get you in the truck right now!

1196
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Mack, just... hold it for... - You should go.

1197
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- I know, but... - Good luck in California.

1198
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:16,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I hope you find what you're looking for.

1199
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:18,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- McQueen, come on! - Sally...

1200
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Sally! - Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

1201
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:24,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1202
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Come on, get in the trailer. - Where's the old McQueen?

1203
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- The bolt! - That's it. That's right, let's go!

1204
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:37,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You're a big shining star. You're a superstar.

1205
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:40,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You don't belong there, anyway.

1206
01:30:40,330 --> 01:30:43,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Whoa... Wait... Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1207
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:48,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, guys! McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

1208
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:57,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1209
01:30:57,950 --> 01:31:00,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Yeah. - Thanks for the call.

1210
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:12,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- You called them? - It's best for everyone, Sally.

1211
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:16,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Best for everyone or best for you?

1212
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:35,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1213
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:38,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hello, race fans. Welcome to what has become, quite simply,

1214
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:40,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}the biggest event in the history of racing.

1215
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:43,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1216
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:45,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}There's a crowd of nearly 200,000 cars

1217
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:48,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}here at the Los Angeles International Speedway.

1218
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:52,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Tickets to this race are hotter than a black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1219
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:55,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}The King, Chick Hicks and Lightning McQueen

1220
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:58,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all, tiebreaker race.

1221
01:32:58,870 --> 01:33:02,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I got a lotta miles on me, but let me tell you somethin'.

1222
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:06,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I never thought I'd see anything like this. This is exciting!

1223
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:08,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}In fact, the country has almost shut down

1224
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:12,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}to watch what many experts are calling "the race of the century."

1225
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:15,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, King! Good luck in your last race.

1226
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:19,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- You've sure been an inspiration to me. - Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1227
01:33:19,690 --> 01:33:22,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Hey, be careful out there, OK? - Yeah, man.

1228
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:23,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He's hot!

1229
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:26,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Wanna know the forecast? I'll give you the forecast.

1230
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:29,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}A 100 percent chance of thunder! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1231
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Say it with me! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1232
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, you! No admittance without a garage pass.

1233
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:38,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, it's OK. Lightning McQueen knows me!

1234
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:41,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day for a race, isn't it?

1235
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:46,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti. - And good morning to you, Fred.

1236
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:50,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Mario Andretti knows my name! You gotta let me in now!

1237
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:51,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Sorry, pal.

1238
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:56,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}OK, here we go. Focus. Speed.

1239
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:59,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I am speed.

1240
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:02,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Victory.

1241
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:04,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}One winner, two losers.

1242
01:34:06,910 --> 01:34:12,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1243
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:19,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Lightnin'! You ready?

1244
01:34:19,290 --> 01:34:21,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1245
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:38,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Mack, thanks for being my pit crew today.

1246
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:40,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Don't worry about it, kid. It's the least I could do.

1247
01:34:40,910 --> 01:34:43,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}After all, "Gas Can" is my middle name.

1248
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:45,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- It is? - Ah... Not really.

1249
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:04,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Uh-oh

1250
01:35:15,310 --> 01:35:18,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Nelson! Zoom in. Ready, 16? Take 16.

1251
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:20,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}And there he is, Lightning McQueen!

1252
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:23,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Missing all week, and then he turns up in the middle of nowhere!

1253
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:26,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}In a little town called Radiator Springs.

1254
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:29,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Wearin' whitewall tires, of all things.

1255
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:33,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Oh! - Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1256
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:37,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, where you been? I've been kinda lonely.

1257
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:40,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Nobody to hang out with. I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1258
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:43,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}And the twins. Of course. The ones that used to be your fans,

1259
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:46,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}but now they're my fans. Listen to what the twins think...

1260
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:58,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Boogity, boogity, boogity, boys! Let's go racin'!

1261
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:06,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Come on, you can do it!

1262
01:36:06,690 --> 01:36:08,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1263
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:13,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Fifty laps down, and The King is still holding a slim lead.

1264
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:16,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}McQueen's got a run on him! He's lookin' to the inside!

1265
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:20,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

1266
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:23,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Chick's not making it easy on him today.

1267
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:25,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He lost momentum,

1268
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:27,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}and now he's gonna have to chase him back down!

1269
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:38,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}McQueen spins out in the infield!

1270
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:45,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Just me and the old man, fellas.

1271
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:49,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}McQueen just doesn't have it today.

1272
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:54,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Hey, kid, are you all right? - I don't know, Mack.

1273
01:36:54,370 --> 01:36:55,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I don't think I...

1274
01:36:55,870 --> 01:36:58,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I didn't come all this way to see you quit.

1275
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Doc?

1276
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:05,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Guys, you're here! I can't believe this!

1277
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:09,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I knew you needed a crew chief, but I didn't know it was this bad.

1278
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:11,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You said you'd never come back.

1279
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:15,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, I really didn't have a choice. Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1280
01:37:15,230 --> 01:37:18,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1281
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:25,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}All right, if you can drive as good as you can fix a road

1282
01:37:25,670 --> 01:37:28,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}then you can win this race with your eyes shut.

1283
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:31,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Now, get back out there!

1284
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:36,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hot snot, we are back in business! Guido! Luigi!

1285
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:38,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You're goin' up against professional pit crews.

1286
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:41,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- You're gonna have to be fast. - They will not know what bit them!

1287
01:37:41,890 --> 01:37:43,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Kid, you can beat these guys.

1288
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:47,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Find a groove that works for you and get that lap back.

1289
01:37:58,770 --> 01:38:00,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Is it? - Oh, wow. That's him!

1290
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:04,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Is that...? That's the Hudson Hornet! The Hudson Hornet's back!

1291
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:07,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}It appears McQueen has got himself a pit crew.

1292
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:09,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}And look who he has for a crew chief!

1293
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:12,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet! - Whoa!

1294
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:15,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, dip me in axle grease and call me Slick! It surely is.

1295
01:38:20,490 --> 01:38:22,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Wow, this is history in the making.

1296
01:38:22,590 --> 01:38:25,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Nobody has seen the racing legend in over 50 years!

1297
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:26,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, Doc!

1298
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:31,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Come look at this fellow on the radio. He looks just like you.

1299
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:39,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}-  McQueen passes on the inside! - He's nearly a lap down.

1300
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:42,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Can he catch up to them with only 60 laps to go?

1301
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:45,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You're goin' great, kid. Just keep your head on.

1302
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Vai! Vai, vai!

1303
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:50,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, shrimpie, where did McQueen find you, huh?

1304
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Those round things are called tires, and they go under the car!

1305
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:57,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Con chi credi di parlare? Ma, con chi stai parlando?

1306
01:38:57,830 --> 01:39:00,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No! No, no! You'll have your chance. You will have your chance.

1307
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:18,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, kid's just tryin' to be a hero, huh?

1308
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:21,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What do you think of this?

1309
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:23,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah, that's it, kid.

1310
01:39:26,630 --> 01:39:27,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What?

1311
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:29,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Whoa! Git-R-done!

1312
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:35,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- I taught him that. Ka-chow! - Ah!

1313
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:38,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What a move by McQueen! He's caught up to the leaders.

1314
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:40,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah. This is what it's all about.

1315
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:44,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}A three-way battle for the lead, with ten to go!

1316
01:39:47,650 --> 01:39:50,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Look at that boy go out there!

1317
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:01,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}No, you don't.

1318
01:40:04,430 --> 01:40:06,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1319
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:09,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Can you get back to the pits? - Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1320
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in. Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1321
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:17,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}We gotta get him back out there fast

1322
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:20,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}or we're gonna be a lap down, and we'll never win this race!

1323
01:40:20,450 --> 01:40:22,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Guido! It's time.

1324
01:40:26,890 --> 01:40:29,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, tiny, you gonna clean his windshield?

1325
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:40,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I don't believe it!

1326
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}That was the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

1327
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:44,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}It was a great stop, but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

1328
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}It's gonna be close.

1329
01:40:48,370 --> 01:40:50,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah, baby!

1330
01:40:50,910 --> 01:40:52,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He's back in!

1331
01:40:53,610 --> 01:40:54,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Peet stop.

1332
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:57,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Guido, you did it! - Way to go, Guido!

1333
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:16,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}This is it. We're heading into the final lap and McQueen

1334
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}is right behind the leaders. What a comeback!

1335
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:22,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}A hundred and ninety-nine laps! It all comes down to this!

1336
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:23,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}This is it, kiddo.

1337
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:26,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You've got four turns left. One at a time.

1338
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:28,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1339
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:30,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Go!

1340
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:34,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}We'll see about that!

1341
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:37,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}McQueen's going inside!

1342
01:41:40,130 --> 01:41:43,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Chick and King are loose! - I think McQueen's out!

1343
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- McQueen saved it! -  He's back on the track!

1344
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:59,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Float like a Cadillac... - Sting like a Beemer!

1345
01:42:00,450 --> 01:42:04,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...

1346
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:08,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Lightning McQueen is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1347
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:10,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Come on! You got it! You got it, Stickers!

1348
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:16,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I am not comin' in behind you again, old man.

1349
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:28,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Oh, no!

1350
01:42:46,890 --> 01:42:49,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1351
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:52,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1352
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What's he up to, Doc?

1353
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:08,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What are you doin', kid?

1354
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:11,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I think The King should finish his last race.

1355
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:17,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You just gave up the Piston Cup, you know that?

1356
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:21,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}This grumpy old racecar I know once told me somethin'.

1357
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:23,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}It's just an empty cup.

1358
01:43:25,460 --> 01:43:28,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Darrell, is pushing on the last lap legal?

1359
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:31,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He's not really pushin' him. He's just givin' him a little bump draft.

1360
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:34,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1361
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:36,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1362
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:39,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}That's what I call racin'.

1363
01:43:55,190 --> 01:43:58,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Bravo il mio amico! - Way to go, buddy!

1364
01:43:58,330 --> 01:44:00,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}There's a lotta love out there, you know, man?

1365
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:05,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore. - That's my hot rod.

1366
01:44:07,570 --> 01:44:11,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Come on, baby, bring it out! Bring out the Piston Cup!

1367
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:12,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1368
01:44:12,540 --> 01:44:15,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Yeah! Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1369
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:18,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, how come the only one celebrating is me, huh?

1370
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:21,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Where are the girls? Bring on the confetti!

1371
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:24,680

1372
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:28,060

1373
01:44:28,130 --> 01:44:29,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1374
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Boo! - Boo!

1375
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:34,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}What's wrong with everybody? Where's the happiness?

1376
01:44:34,530 --> 01:44:36,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1377
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:45,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- Thanks, Lightnin'. - You're welcome.

1378

1379
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:51,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You're The King! Yeah!

1380
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:05,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- You made us proud, kid! - Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1381
01:45:09,030 --> 01:45:11,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1382
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:13,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Thanks, Doc.

1383

{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, Lightnin'.

1384
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:18,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}How 'bout comin' over here and talk to me a minute?

1385
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:22,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Son, that was some real racin' out there.

1386
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:25,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}How'd you like to become the new face of Dinoco?

1387
01:45:30,220 --> 01:45:31,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}But I didn't win.

1388
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:35,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Lightnin', there's a whole lot more to racin' than just winnin'.

1389
01:45:35,490 --> 01:45:38,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}He was so rusty, when he drove down the street

1390
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:42,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}buzzards used to circle the car!

1391
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:44,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1392
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:48,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}...but these Rust-eze guys over there gave me my big break.

1393
01:45:49,570 --> 01:45:51,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm gonna stick with them.

1394
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:54,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, I sure can respect that.

1395
01:45:54,510 --> 01:45:55,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Still, you know,

1396
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:59,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}if there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know.

1397
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:02,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I sure appreciate that. Thank you.

1398
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:06,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Actually, there is one thing.

1399
01:46:07,390 --> 01:46:08,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Whoo-hoo!

1400

1401
01:46:09,690 --> 01:46:13,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hey, look at me! I'm flyin', by golly!

1402
01:46:18,070 --> 01:46:21,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I'm happier than a tornado in a trailer park!

1403
01:46:24,710 --> 01:46:27,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}I think it's about-a time we redecorate.

1404
01:46:30,150 --> 01:46:33,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Hi. Lightning McQueen told me this was the best place in the world

1405

1406
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:38,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}How 'bout setting me and my friends up with three or four sets each?

1407
01:46:38,990 --> 01:46:44,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Guido! There is a real Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

1414
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:19,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Actually, I thought I'd stop and stay awhile.

1415
01:47:19,830 --> 01:47:23,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}- I hear this place is back on the map. - It is?

1416
01:47:23,170 --> 01:47:26,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}There's some rumor floating around that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

1417

1420
01:47:35,010 --> 01:47:39,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}Well, I create feelings in others they themselves don't understand and,

1421
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:41,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&}blah, blah, blah.
