水漾青春

7
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:41,375
给  宝贝  喝点果汁
Here you go, honey.

8
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,415
今天感觉如何
You all right?

9
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:45,015
有点僵硬
Quite stiff.

10
00:01:45,015 --> 00:01:47,015
- 你的腿吗  - 对
- What, your leg? - Yeah.

11
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:49,455
我来给你看看
Let's have a look.

12
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:50,975
是这儿吗
Where, up here?

13
00:01:55,935 --> 00:01:58,955
- 另一条腿呢  - 也有一点
- How's the other one? - Yeah.

14
00:01:59,555 --> 00:00:00,175
那只腿也给我
Come on.

15
00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:10,495
- 好了  - 谢了  爸
- OK. - Thanks, Dad.

16
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:14,455
对  就是这样  都喝下去  我先去换衣服  待会儿再见
Right,drink up.I'll go get dressed.See you in a minute.

17
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,175
琳赛  琳赛  快下来
Lindsey. Lindsey. Come on.

18
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:52,815
- 爱你  宝贝  - 我也爱你
- I love you, darling. - I love you, too.

19
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:17,455
好了  我们先试着倒立起来  然后再转移自己的重心
All right,let's start with some kick up hands-
tands,then we'll move onto some weights,yeah?

20
00:03:17,455 --> 00:03:20,335
要让你自己的力量撑起身体
We're going to work on your strength, so

21
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:23,935
双手触地  将肩膀的重心集中到指尖
hands down, shoulders over fingertips...

22
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,815
先抬起一条腿
Kick one leg up.

23
00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:33,615
好了  琳赛  另一条腿  对  就是这样  脚趾并拢
That's you. Another leg, Lindsey, that's it. Toes together,

24
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:36,775
肩膀抬高
push up through the shoulders...

25
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:39,135
就是这样  现在换你自己一个人试试
That's it. Now try it on your own.

26
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,455
靠你自身的力量  做得好  漂亮
Try it on your own. Good girl. Good girl!

27
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,935
好了  琳赛  我想看你做一次空中旋转一周半
All right, Lindsey, I want to see a back one-and-a-half twister.

28
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:52,015
别忘了我给你说的  注意你的脚跟平衡性...  非常好
Remember the things we've talked
about, your feet, your poise...That's it.

29
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:55,375
很好  动作再利落一点
That's it. A bit straighter.

30
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:59,495
好了  双臂再收拢一点
OK. I want you to think about fast arms and a tight tuck.

31
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:04,575
头别往后仰  朝前倾一点  还有  双臂再夹紧一点
Your head's going back,you need to keep
it  forwards, yeah, and a tighter tuck.

32
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:08,575
集中精力  琳赛  我知道这很辛苦
Come on, concentrate. I know it's tough, Lindsey, but it's going to

33
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:12,495
但你要是想参加12年伦敦奥运会的话以后会更难
get tougher if you want to be in contention for the Olympics in 2012.

34
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:15,335
好了  集中注意力  准备起跳
OK, focus. Here we go.

35
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:27,015
非常好  琳赛  果然不负我所望
Great, Lindsey, that's what I'm looking for.

36
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:30,055
以后也要像刚才那样练习  知道吗
Let's do some more like that, yeah?

37
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:32,255
非常棒  做得很好
Fantastic. Good work.

38
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:38,775
好了  准备好了吗
OK, are you ready?

39
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:40,895
很好  记住了  身体别往后仰
That's it. Remember, don't lean back.

40
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:52,495
比刚才还要棒  琳赛  真的  你就要达到顶尖水准了
That was much better. Really good. Lindsey, you're really getting there.

41
00:04:54,535 --> 00:04:56,895
我太废了
I was rubbish.

42
00:04:56,895 --> 00:05:00,575
我上二头肌跟肩胛骨之间那块肌肉拉伤了
There's a strain in my shoulder between
my upper bicep and my scapula.

43
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:03,655
这就意味着我参加奥运会的机会越来越渺茫了
It means I'm pulling back on the point of entry.

44
00:05:03,655 --> 00:05:05,175
我得把这事儿解决好
I need to sort it out.

45
00:05:16,575 --> 00:05:18,375
这些箱子是用来干嘛的
What are these boxes for?

46
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,275
我不怪你妈妈
I don't blame your mum.

47
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,375
我们暂时只是...
For a while now, we've just been...

48
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:58,535
我们...
We've been...

49
00:05:58,535 --> 00:06:00,055
只是...
just...

50
00:06:05,335 --> 00:06:07,415
人生只有一次  宝贝
You only get one life, darling,

51
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:12,135
生活也并不总能如你所愿
and things don't always go the way that you want them to go.

52
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:16,935
我从来都不想...
I never wanted to...

53
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:21,775
让你这样失望的
be letting you down like this.

54
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:25,175
我...我是失败了
I... I failed.

55
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:32,455
但是人生不如意十之八九
But that's real life, people fail sometimes.

56
00:06:37,455 --> 00:06:39,615
我很对不起你
I'm sorry.

57
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,855
即使你失败了  你也不应该逃避
Just because you've failed doesn't mean you have to walk away.

58
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:50,695
事情没那么容易  宝贝  我真的很抱歉
It's not as simple as that, darling, I'm sorry.

59
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:58,735
这是给你的  里面有一百块钱
That's for you. It's a hundred.

60
00:07:56,215 --> 00:07:57,855
他给了你多少钱
How much did he give YOU?

61
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:06,535
- 一百英镑  - 比给我的多多了
- Hundred pound. - More than he gave me.

62
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:12,015
还有个惊喜等着你呢
It's not the last surprise you're going to get today.

63
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,095
自己进去看吧
Take a look inside.

64
00:08:41,695 --> 00:08:44,415
宝贝  这是盖瑞
Sweetheart, this is Gary.

65
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:20,175
各位  早上好
Morning, everyone.

66
00:10:20,175 --> 00:10:21,815
早上好  老师
Morning, sir.

67
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:25,815
首先呢  我有个好消息要告诉大家
First, um, a good, positive piece of news.

68
00:10:25,815 --> 00:10:31,495
昨天进入到镇体育队的人请站起来  大家鼓掌
All those who were in the town sports yesterday,
please stand up.Give them a round of applause.

69
00:10:31,495 --> 00:10:33,495
做得很好  各位
Well done, everyone.

70
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:47,975
先取出安全套...
Take the condom out...

71
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:53,575
先看一下  别弄反了  不然你是套不上去的
Have a look at it and make sure it's the right way
up - you do not put this on the wrong way round.

72
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:54,735
你们自然会知道怎样套才是正确的
You'll know it's the right way up

73
00:10:54,735 --> 00:10:56,935
因为只有正确的方式才能翻得下去
cos it can only roll down one way.

74
00:10:56,935 --> 00:10:59,695
要是你拿反了的话  你是翻不下去的
If you put it on the wrong way,it won't roll down.

75
00:10:59,695 --> 00:11:03,735
我们先挑一个模型  杰克  你来挑一个颜色
And we're going to choose a demonstrator. Jack, pick a colour.

76
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:06,415
- 蓝色的  - 好  蓝色的
- Blue? - Blue it is.

77
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,295
我们有各种颜色的  不是吗
They come in all colours, OK?

78
00:11:08,295 --> 00:11:11,015
再说了  这些只是模型  不是真的阴茎
And these are demonstrators. It's not a penis.

79
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:14,695
这是拿来给你们做试验用的  知道吗
It is designed for you to practise putting condoms on, OK?

80
00:11:14,695 --> 00:11:18,175
在你们翻下去之前  得先挤一下这个小囊
So before you start rolling it down, you squeeze this end bit.

81
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:20,455
确保里面没有多余的空气
Make sure there's no air trapped in there.

82
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:23,135
有谁能告诉我为什么这个这么重要吗
Can someone tell me why that's important?

83
00:11:24,655 --> 00:11:27,215
- 卢克  你来说  - 要是不排净的话会很容易破的
- Luke? - It could easily break.

84
00:11:27,215 --> 00:11:30,975
囊内留有空气会增加破裂几率  你们可不想这种事发生
Yeah,it increases the chance of that splitting and you don't want that to happen.

85
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:35,455
然后你们捏住头  很容易就能翻到底
So you're holding onto the end and
then simply roll it down to the base,

86
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:39,335
一定要确保所有步骤都做到位  很容易就搞定了
ensuring that it's all the way down.Nice and easy.

87
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:44,455
好了  接下来你们照着我给你们的单子一次一人练习
OK, so now you're working one at a time
and I want you ticking off on this sheet.

88
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:47,655
艾米丽  安博  你们俩在听我讲课吗
So Emily, Amber, are you listening?

89
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:49,255
好了  你们俩谁先来
So who's going first?

90
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:52,215
那艾米丽  你先  安博  你就负责核对单子上的步骤
Emily's going first. Amber, you check off on that sheet.

91
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:55,375
你先把她的名字写上  她做你就核对
You put her name on it,you check off as she goes.

92
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:03,895
名字写在“姓名”一栏
Where it says "name here".

93
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:08,735
你就把“扎克”  你的名字写在这儿
So put "Zach" and you're going to put your name there.

94
00:12:08,735 --> 00:12:10,255
还有那儿
And there.

95
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:16,775
你先照着做  艾米给你打成绩
You're going to do it,and Amy's grading you.

96
00:12:20,455 --> 00:12:24,295
- 早上好  老师  - 下午好  海莉  琳赛
- Morning, sir. - Afternoon, Hailey. Lindsey.

97
00:12:28,175 --> 00:12:30,335
他耳朵总是红的  真是有趣
He always goes bright red,it's so funny.

98
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:34,055
你今晚去果园吗
Are you going to the grove tonight?

99
00:12:34,055 --> 00:12:37,135
对  当然要去
Oh, yes!

100
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:41,095
你肯定又要去泳池了
No doubt you'll be at the pool again.

101
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:43,055
谁知道呢
You never know.

102
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:45,135
你可是琳赛・麦克卡莱姆啊
Oh, Lindsey McCallum!

103
00:13:13,815 --> 00:13:16,695
我之前可没见过你打扮得这么隆重呢
I don't think I've seen you so dressed up before.

104
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:21,415
化妆之后很漂亮呢  对吧
Make-up suits you, you know?

105
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:26,735
今天的训练如何
How was training today?

106
00:13:26,735 --> 00:13:28,255
很好
Fine.

107
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,335
对了  对了
Here. Here.

108
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:39,415
拿着
Take this.

109
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,215
那个...呃...
So, er,

110
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:48,575
- 你什么时候回来  - 我也不知道
- what time will you be back? - I don't know.

111
00:13:48,575 --> 00:13:52,095
- 那十点钟你觉得会不会太早  - 不会
- Do you think ten o'clock's too early? - No.

112
00:13:52,095 --> 00:13:54,655
要是你要回来的晚一点  记得给我们打电话  好吗
You'll give us a ring, won't you, if you're going to be later?

113
00:13:54,655 --> 00:13:55,655
嗯
Mm-hm.

114
00:13:58,455 --> 00:14:01,535
你确定不需要盖瑞载你一程
Are you sure you don't want Gary to give you a lift?

115
00:14:01,535 --> 00:14:04,815
我确定肯定以及一定  我不想要盖瑞送我去
I'm completely sure I don't want Gary to give me a lift.

116
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:11,175
琳赛...
Lindsey...

117
00:14:16,535 --> 00:14:19,215
我跟你爸两个
We had no idea,

118
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:20,735
我们真没办法过下去了
me and your dad.

119
00:14:23,935 --> 00:14:27,255
我从中学到唯一一件事
If I've learnt anything at all about anything,

120
00:14:27,255 --> 00:14:31,055
那就是世事难料
it's that you never know what's going to happen,ever.

121
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:38,215
还有...你今天真的...很漂亮
Hey, you look... you look lovely, by the way.

122
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:03,415
我是要去找两卷大麻还是怎么着
Am I going to get two on my spliff or what?

123
00:15:06,015 --> 00:15:09,035
- 诶  诶  - 你还好吗
- Oi, oi! - You all right?

124
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:10,595
等等  酒呢
Hold on, where's the drink?!

125
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:12,075
你可不能空着手过来
You can't come down here with no drink!

126
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:13,375
你已经都喝醉了
You're loaded!

127
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,295
他每次都是这样
Every single time, that is.

128
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:18,495
各位  这位是琳赛
Everybody, this is Lindsey.

很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.

131
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:26,015

Hardly to believe it, isn't it?

151
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:13,295
天气真是适合聚会啊
What lovely weather for it!

152
00:16:18,295 --> 00:16:21,095
你真是公主吗

153
00:16:21,095 --> 00:16:23,775
- 不是  - 那就好  我叫罗柏

You're a swimmer or summat, aren't you?

159
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:39,295
- 跳水运动员  - 那就对了
- A diver. Yeah. - That's it.

160
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:44,935
你已经收获了很多证书奖章还有奖品  对吧
You've won loads of certificates and medals and awards, ain't you?

161
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:46,455
哇哦
Wow.

162
00:16:52,255 --> 00:16:54,535
我以前怎么从没在这附近见过你
I ain't seen you down here before.

163
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:56,855
我以前没来过这儿
I've not been here before.

164
00:16:56,855 --> 00:17:00,095
- 那你是从哪儿来的  - 金斯索普上城区
- Where you from? - Up Kingsthorpe.

165
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:04,375
我知道  那地方每层楼都有间浴室
Oh, yeah, every house has got a bathroom on each floor,

166
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:08,175
主人的房间就在起居室正上方  你肯定还有个车库
master bedroom's above the living room, you've got a garage,

167
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:10,535
还有个漂亮的小花园
nice little garden set up.

168
00:17:10,535 --> 00:17:12,215
你是怎么知道的
How did you know that?

169
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:20,255
你跟你父母住一块儿吗
Do you live with mum and dad?

170
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:21,855
我跟我妈
With my mum.

171
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:23,455
还有我小弟住一起
And my little brother.

172
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,095
好吧  那他几岁了
Oh aye, how old's he?

173
00:17:25,095 --> 00:17:26,695
十岁
Ten.

174
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:30,095
那他肯定是个彻头彻尾的小混蛋
Is he a complete and total wank
of a pain in the jacksy then, yeah?

175
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:32,715
- 不  他不是那样的    - 不是吗
- No, he's not. -  Nah?

176
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:35,615
不是  他人挺好的
No, he's great.

177
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:46,295
我有事想跟你说  琳
Can I tell you something, Linds?

178
00:17:46,295 --> 00:17:48,695
说吧
Yeah.

179
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:51,095
我觉得你实在是太美了
I think you're completely gorgeous.

180
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,295
琳赛  我没有保护措施
Lindsey, I've got no protection.

181
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,255
这是你的初夜  对吗
That was your first time, wasn't it?

182
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:38,975
嗯
Mm.

183
00:19:48,615 --> 00:19:50,135
那现在该怎么办
So, what now?

184
00:20:23,775 --> 00:20:25,335
现在都快半夜了
It's nearly midnight.

185
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:27,695
不用你管
No shit.

186
00:20:27,695 --> 00:20:29,775
- 你妈妈很担心你  - 是吗
- Your mum was very worried. - Yeah?

187
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:31,175
是的  你明天还得上课呢
Yeah. You've got school tomorrow.

188
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:36,695
琳赛  听我说  呃...
Lindsey, look, er...

189
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:43,975
我...
I'm...

190
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:45,495
我不是你爸爸
I'm not your dad.

191
00:20:47,015 --> 00:20:48,535
这点我很清楚
I know that.

192
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:54,855
我也不会装作我是  好吗
Look, I'm not going to pretend that I am, OK?

193
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:59,335
可是我真的很爱你妈妈
But I love your mum very much.

194
00:21:01,855 --> 00:21:05,295
但要是你半夜才会回家
And,you know,if you're going to come in at midnight,

195
00:21:05,295 --> 00:21:09,295
你就给她打给电话  让她知道你平安就好
if you could just, you know, give her
a call, let her know where you are.

196
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,855
她真的非常担心你的安危  琳赛
You know,she was worried sick about you,Lindsey.

197
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:18,735
说完了  那就晚安吧
Good. Night-night.

198
00:22:30,695 --> 00:22:35,535
你越来越棒了  琳赛  刚才那个摆肩做得非常好
That's much more like it, Lindsey, that's
a good rolling of the shoulders, yeah?

199
00:22:35,535 --> 00:22:38,775
要有力地长划  记得吗  做得很好
Good long strokes, remember? Good girl.

200
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:35,495
你好
Hiya.

201
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:38,215
琳
Linds.

202
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:45,295
你今晚还去果园吗
Are you going to the grove tonight?

203
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:46,935
也许吧
Probably.

204
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:49,295
我要去
Cos I am.

205
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:53,815
很好
Cool.

206
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:56,295
那我们就在那儿再见  行吗
Well, I'm going to see you there then, aren't I?

207
00:24:11,455 --> 00:24:15,575
在男性蛋蛋下面有一个区域...
There's an area just underneath where the balls are.

208
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:19,135
你确定你真想听吗
Are you sure you want to hear this?!

209
00:24:19,135 --> 00:24:20,215
我确定
I do, yeah.

210
00:24:20,215 --> 00:24:25,215
这不像你的风格  你知道我什么意思吗  好吧
It's just not very you,do you know what I mean? OK. So...

211
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,735
当你添下去的时候...
When you go down on them right...

212
00:24:27,735 --> 00:24:30,095
提醒你一下  有些人的会尝起来怪怪的
Some of them can taste a bit funny, by the way.

213
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,735
怪怪的
Funny?

214
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:34,335
不是所有人啦  只是一部分而已
Well, not all of them. Some are all right.

215
00:24:34,335 --> 00:24:36,175
那那部分人占的比例是多少
Like, what percentage?

216
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:39,615
呃  我也不清楚  大概是5:5吧
Er, I don't know. Maybe 50/50?

217
00:24:39,615 --> 00:24:41,615
也可能是4:6
40/60?

218
00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:43,375
管它呢
Anyway.

219
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,015
当他们快要到了...
When they're getting close...

220
00:24:45,015 --> 00:24:48,295
- 快要到了  - 当他们快要射了的时候
- Getting close? - When they're about to come!

221
00:24:48,295 --> 00:24:52,215
你就会感觉得到  因为他们身体会微颤  然后你就用手指
You can feel it cos they'll start to shake a bit. You get your finger

222
00:24:52,215 --> 00:24:59,775
按住他蛋蛋跟股沟之间的位置  就能暂时阻止他射出来
and you press it just in this area between his balls
and his arse, and it stops him from coming.

223
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:02,515
这会让他那精虫上脑的头冷静一下
It will blow his fucking mind.

224
00:25:02,515 --> 00:25:05,535
他要再射的话就得多花五分钟了
He'll be able to go like for about another five more minutes.

225
00:25:05,535 --> 00:25:10,615
但这一次  他就会射得到处都是
And then,when he comes,it will go fucking everywhere.

226
00:25:10,615 --> 00:25:12,615
我上次头发上都射得到处都是
Last time, it went in my hair.

227
00:25:12,615 --> 00:25:13,715
真的假的
Really?!

228
00:25:13,715 --> 00:25:17,415
当然是真的  害得我不得不洗了头发  湿漉漉地回家了
Yeah!I had to wash it.I had to go home with wet hair.

229
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,775
还跟我父母解释了大半天
Try explaining that one away!

230
00:25:19,775 --> 00:25:22,295
我就可以说我跳水去了
I could say I'd gone diving.

231
00:25:57,215 --> 00:25:58,895
你这周末准备干吗
What are you doing this weekend?

232
00:26:01,815 --> 00:26:04,295
什么
What?

233
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:06,695
你~这~个~周~末~准~备~干~嘛
What are you doing this weekend?

234
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:09,055
怎么这么问
Why?

235
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:10,655
因为我周末没有安排
Cos I'm not doing anything.

236
00:26:13,175 --> 00:26:15,495
呃... 琳...天呐...嗯...
Aw, Linds, man, um...

237
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:23,935
我现在真的很不想交女朋友
I don't really do girlfriends and shit.

238
00:26:29,975 --> 00:26:31,495
我觉得这样没什么用
I'm just a bit wank at them.

239
00:27:57,095 --> 00:27:59,295
琳
Linds!

240
00:27:59,295 --> 00:28:01,655
- 今晚去果园  你去吗  - 我要训练
- Grove tonight, you coming? - I'm training.

241
00:28:01,655 --> 00:28:04,375
- 我要早点过去  - 我要训练
- I'm getting there early. - I'm training.

242
00:28:05,655 --> 00:28:13,495
- 真丢人  老兄  真丢人  - 哦  不
- Woah! Shame, mate, shame! - Oh! Oh, no!

243
00:28:13,495 --> 00:28:17,295
兄弟们  我们得快点出去  快点   赶快出去  快
Boys, boys, out of here, quick time.
Get out of here, quick time!

244
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:30,775
就是这样  琳赛  这就是我们想要的效果  对吧
That's the one, Lindsey,that's exactly
what we've been talking about, yeah?

245
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,415
你自己一定感觉到了
You must have felt it yourself.

246
00:28:32,415 --> 00:28:35,095
双腿夹得很紧  身体控制得也非常棒
Your feet were tight,your body was controlled.

247
00:28:35,095 --> 00:28:38,215
这就是评委想看到的东西  你说对吗
That's exactly the things the judges are looking for, yeah?

248
00:28:47,055 --> 00:28:49,415
他们要来水晶宫了
They're coming to Crystal Palace.

249
00:28:49,415 --> 00:28:51,175
英国国家游泳队要来了
British Swimming.

250
00:28:51,175 --> 00:28:53,775
他们要为奥运会选拔运动员
They're making selections for the Olympic team.

251
00:28:57,615 --> 00:28:59,575
我们能换个时间再聊吗
Can we do another hour?

252
00:29:11,695 --> 00:29:14,415
其他人还有多少要去  琳
How many other kids are going, Linds?

253
00:29:14,415 --> 00:29:16,935
没了  就我一个人
There are no other kids. I'm the only one.

254
00:29:18,575 --> 00:29:20,735
不错嘛  琳
That's great, Linds.

255
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:31,295
你是说要去伦敦吗
London, did you say?

256
00:29:34,415 --> 00:29:36,375
宝贝  我不知道该怎么做
Sweetheart, I don't know what to do.

257
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:39,735
听着  我不能不去工作
Look, I can't get off work.

258
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:41,655
目前家里情况也很困难
It's really hard at the moment.

259
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,135
我们会想办法的
We'll think of something.

260
00:29:46,135 --> 00:29:47,815
想什么办法
Like what?

261
00:29:51,495 --> 00:29:52,615
我可以送你去
I could take you.

262
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,095
我不想让你送我
I don't want you to take me.

263
00:29:58,095 --> 00:29:59,975
这又跟你有毛关系啊
What's it got to do with you?

264
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:01,895
关你娘的鸟事
It's none of your fucking business.

265
00:30:01,895 --> 00:30:05,095
嘿  琳赛
Hey! Lindsey!

266
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:11,455
诶  琳赛
Oi! Lindsey!

267
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:29,415
他是个好男人  你知道吗
He's a very kind man, you know?

268
00:30:32,215 --> 00:30:33,855
他是真的在乎我
He cares about me.

269
00:30:40,095 --> 00:30:41,975
他也能让我感觉到幸福
He makes me happy.

270
00:30:47,975 --> 00:30:50,615
每次跟他在一起我心里都很开心
I even catch myself laughing.

271
00:30:52,535 --> 00:30:54,575
好几次我甚至都笑出了声
Out loud, sometimes.

272
00:31:01,335 --> 00:31:05,855
大多数时候  他仿佛非常了解我的心思
You know, half of the time, it's like he knows what I'm thinking.

273
00:31:05,855 --> 00:31:10,455
我们可以坐在一块聊上好几个小时
We can be in the same room and not have
to talk to one another for hours.

274
00:31:15,015 --> 00:31:17,375
而且每次出去时他都会挽着我的手
He holds my hand when I'm out with him.

275
00:31:58,255 --> 00:31:59,335
你在这儿干嘛呢
What are you doing here?

276
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:00,935
我想跟你说会儿话
I wanted to talk to you.

277
00:32:02,935 --> 00:32:04,935
琳  我都在这儿等了你一个小时了
Linds, I've been waiting for an hour!

278
00:32:06,055 --> 00:32:09,015
我以前从来没有等过别人这么久  琳赛
I've not waited an hour for anybody before,Lindsey.

279
00:32:10,535 --> 00:32:13,295
你知道我要上多少课吗
Do you know how many lessons I've had?

280
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:17,695
2500堂
2,500.

281
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:20,735
那可是足足一万个小时
That's 10,000 hours.

282
00:32:20,735 --> 00:32:23,855
整整420天  一年零三个月我都得待在泳池里面
420 days.A year and a quarter in a pool.

283
00:32:25,295 --> 00:32:28,855
你知道那么长时间我可以做多少其它事儿吗
Do you have any idea what else I
could have been doing with that time?

284
00:32:31,055 --> 00:32:33,695
我现在才不会半途而废呢
I'm not going to throw that away now.

285
00:32:33,695 --> 00:32:35,095
没人让你半途而废  琳
No one's asking you to, Linds.

286
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:38,295
不会有人让你退出的
At all.

287
00:33:22,495 --> 00:33:24,975
觉得我跳得怎么样
How was that?

288
00:33:24,975 --> 00:33:27,175
还不错
It was all right.

289
00:33:27,175 --> 00:33:28,575
但我见过跳得更好的
Seen better.

290
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:32,975
谢了  大混蛋
Thanks, arsehole!

291
00:33:34,775 --> 00:33:35,815
在那上面跳如何
What's up with that one?

292
00:33:35,815 --> 00:33:38,015
- 哪个  - 那个木板
- You what? - That board.

293
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:39,655
- 你想让我在那上面跳  - 对
- What, you want me to do that? - Yeah.

294
00:33:39,655 --> 00:33:40,855
不去  去你丫的
No, you can fuck off!

295
00:33:40,855 --> 00:33:42,415
我才不会在刚跳完就去跳那个
I'm not doing that after that!

296
00:33:50,255 --> 00:33:52,215
来呀  让我看看你有什么能耐
Go on, let's see what YOU can do, then.

297
00:33:52,815 --> 00:33:56,215
哦~  到我这儿来
Ohh, come here.

298
00:33:57,615 --> 00:33:58,855
不许赢我
Don't knock me down.

299
00:33:58,855 --> 00:34:00,375
快出来吧
You, come on. Just come out here.

300
00:34:01,935 --> 00:34:05,835
- 我觉得这样太缺德了  琳  - 是吗
- I thought that was wicked, Linds. - Yeah?

301
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,935
是的  你居然还觉得这样做很好
Thought that was proper, yeah.

302
00:34:08,935 --> 00:34:11,055
谢了  你个笨蛋
Well, thank you, you clown.

303
00:34:11,055 --> 00:34:12,575
不用谢
It's all right.

304
00:34:14,695 --> 00:34:17,495
那你就让我看看你的能耐
Let's see what you can do, then.

305
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,215
你害怕了吗
Are you scared, yeah?

306
00:34:22,215 --> 00:34:23,255
- 对  - 快跳吧
- Yeah. - Go on.

307
00:34:23,255 --> 00:34:25,935
好了  把头含起来
Right, OK. Tuck your head in.

308
00:34:25,935 --> 00:34:28,335
- 现在把双手抬起来  好吗  - 行
- Now put your arms up. Yeah? - Yeah.

309
00:34:28,335 --> 00:34:30,765
你跳水之前得预想一下
You've got to visualise the dive before you do it.

310
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:31,455
什么
What?!

311
00:34:32,975 --> 00:34:35,075
- 你得先知道  - 别管我
- You've got to know - Leave alone with me,

312
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:36,375
- 你要怎么跳  - 让我自己跳
- what you're going to do, -  leave me alone.

313
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,975
你头脑里先得要想一下待会儿要怎么跳
you've got to know what you're going to do in your head.

314
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:38,875
- 知道了  - 那就这样吧
- OK. - All right then.

315
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:41,275
- 好吧  - 好吧
- All right. - All right.

316
00:34:42,615 --> 00:34:45,955
- 我不行  - 你当然行  跳吧
- I can't! - Yeah, you can! Go on!

317
00:34:45,955 --> 00:34:46,255
对  我跳
Right, go on.

318
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:48,855
你一定要先想好该怎么跳
You've got to visualise what you're going to do.

319
00:34:48,855 --> 00:34:51,375
就在你脑中想像一下...  别
Like, just think about it in your head... No!

320
00:34:56,975 --> 00:34:58,655
我好像感觉被灼伤了
I feel like I've got sunburn.

321
00:35:00,175 --> 00:35:01,695
放屁
That was shit!

322
00:35:04,175 --> 00:35:06,975
- 简直是在胡闹  - 我这一跳可是奥运会水准
- Crock of shit. - Well, mine's Olympic standard.

323
00:35:06,975 --> 00:35:08,815
- 你说什么  - 拉我一把
- You what? - Give us a hand up.

324
00:35:12,215 --> 00:35:13,775
你这个蠢货
You prick.

325
00:35:13,775 --> 00:35:15,375
- 什么  - 你这个蠢货
- What?! - You prick!

326
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:17,255
居然敢把我拉下水
For pushing me in the water.

327
00:35:17,255 --> 00:35:19,055
你不是自己掉下来的么
Did you not just fall in?

328
00:35:25,855 --> 00:35:28,495
这池子有点深
It's quite deep.

329
00:35:28,495 --> 00:35:31,415
- 池子好深啊  - 你怕了
- It's quite deep. - You scared?

330
00:35:31,415 --> 00:35:33,415
好了  你已经到岸边了
That's it, you're nearly at the side.

331
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:34,975
我们应该去儿童泳池吗
Shall we go in the baby pool?

332
00:35:52,295 --> 00:35:54,815
- 你好 特瑞希  - 你跟罗柏在一起干嘛
- Hiya, Tracey. - What you doing with Robert?

333
00:35:54,815 --> 00:35:56,215
什么
What?

334
00:35:56,215 --> 00:35:57,735
你跟罗柏搅在一起干嘛
What you doing with Robert?

335
00:36:01,815 --> 00:36:03,735
我在问你话呢
I asked you a question!

336
00:36:03,735 --> 00:36:07,575
你到底跟罗柏在一起干什么
What have you been doing with Robert?

337
00:36:07,575 --> 00:36:09,695
- 没干嘛  - 没听见
- Nowt. - Sorry?!

338
00:36:10,495 --> 00:36:11,695
我们什么事也没有
Nothing.

339
00:36:11,695 --> 00:36:13,975
骗子
Liar.

340
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:16,135
你妈的大骗子
You fucking liar.

341
00:36:16,135 --> 00:36:19,015
不许跟我撒谎
Don't lie to me!

342
00:36:20,935 --> 00:36:22,615
你就打算一直站在那儿吗
So you just going to stand there?

343
00:36:22,615 --> 00:36:27,135
你知道吗  我最受不了你这种女孩了  你真是可悲
Do you know what, I can't stand girls like you, you're pathetic.

344
00:36:27,135 --> 00:36:30,495
你这个淫贱的荡妇
You're a dirty little slag.

345
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:36,495
你究竟跟罗柏在一起干嘛
What are you doing with Robert?

346
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:42,215
我再问你最后一次  你到底跟罗柏在一起干什么
I'm going to ask you one more time,
what are you doing with Robert?!

347
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:53,655
好了  琳赛  都缝好了
OK, Lindsey, that's all done now.

348
00:36:53,655 --> 00:36:58,015
你只要保持伤口的清洁  应该就不会结疤了
What I need you to do is keep that nice
and clean and it'll heal beautifully.

349
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:59,855
我这样还能游泳吗
Will I be able to swim with it?

350
00:36:59,855 --> 00:37:01,855
当然可以
I don't see why not.

351
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:07,375
你下周还得再过来一次  好让护士帮你拆线
You need to make an appointment for next week so
that the nurse can take the stitches out for you.

352
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,895
都弄好了  你觉得如何
All done. Is that OK?

353
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,735
你还好吗
You all right?

354
00:37:13,295 --> 00:37:14,975
我还有件事
There was something else.

355
00:37:14,975 --> 00:37:17,655
什么事
What's that?

356
00:37:17,655 --> 00:37:19,775
我有个地方总是有血迹
There was some bleeding.

357
00:37:19,775 --> 00:37:21,415
在哪儿
What kind of bleeding?

358
00:37:22,935 --> 00:37:25,415
- 我内裤那块儿  - 好吧
- In my knickers. - OK.

359
00:37:25,415 --> 00:37:27,855
你开始来月经了吗  琳赛
Have you started your periods yet, Lindsey?

360
00:37:27,855 --> 00:37:30,775
是吗  规律吗
Yes? Regular?

361
00:37:30,775 --> 00:37:34,995
- 但你觉得这次来得不寻常是吗  - 对
- So this is a bit unusual for you,is it?Yeah?- Yeah.

362
00:37:34,995 --> 00:37:37,975
琳赛  宝贝  你觉得有没有可能你是怀孕了
Lindsey, sweetheart, do you think you might be pregnant?

363
00:37:41,615 --> 00:37:43,735
不是很确定吗
Not very sure?

364
00:37:43,735 --> 00:37:48,455
好吧  我们可以做个检查  就做个尿检就行
OK, we can do a test, it's just a urine test.

365
00:37:48,455 --> 00:37:50,215
不会耽搁太久的
Won't take very long.

366
00:37:50,215 --> 00:37:52,335
你觉得行吗
Will that be all right?

367
00:37:52,335 --> 00:37:54,335
还是心里有个数好些
Probably better to know.

368
00:37:55,855 --> 00:38:00,535
我给你个杯子  你待会儿就尿在里面  我们会检测出来的
I'll just go and get a pot and then you can
do a wee for me and we can sort that out.

369
00:38:00,535 --> 00:38:02,055
我去去就回
Back in a minute.

370
00:38:18,455 --> 00:38:20,455
- 你迟到了  - 我知道
- You're late. - Yeah.

371
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:33,295
注意  双臂打直
Look, line up.

372
00:38:33,295 --> 00:38:35,895
对  就是这样  再压紧一点
That's it, that's it. Really squeeze.

373
00:38:35,895 --> 00:38:38,055
用力挤  非常好
Really squeeze, that's great.

374
00:38:38,055 --> 00:38:41,055
做得很好  现在放松  可以了
Well done. And relax, that's enough.

375
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:43,575
你可以先休息会儿了   刚才做的非常好
You can stop now. That's good.

376
00:38:45,855 --> 00:38:48,895
可以停了  琳赛
You can stop now, Lindsey.

377
00:38:48,895 --> 00:38:50,415
够了
That's enough.

378
00:38:53,575 --> 00:38:55,095
我说“够了”
That's enough.

379
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:16,655
入水水花太大
That was a sloppy entrance.

380
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:21,175
还不够好  你是把自己抛下去的
Not good enough. You just gave up.

381
00:39:24,935 --> 00:39:28,375
我想看你再来一次  你的脚打水太严重了  你的...
I want to see it again.Your feet were sloppy,your...

382
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:32,295
嘿  回来  回来  回来听我说完
Hey,come here,come here!Come here and speak to me.

383
00:39:32,295 --> 00:39:36,615
我跟你说话的时候不许扭头就走  你心不在焉的
Don't you walk away from me when I'm
speaking to you. You weren't focused.

384
00:39:36,615 --> 00:39:38,815
你得再用功一点
You have to concentrate more.

385
00:39:42,855 --> 00:39:45,455
我认为我们需要在每周多加四个小时时间训练
I think we need to put in four more hours a week.

386
00:39:47,015 --> 00:39:49,535
嘿
Hey.

387
00:39:49,535 --> 00:39:51,535
看着我
Look at me.

388
00:39:51,535 --> 00:39:56,535
琳赛  看着我的眼睛  这就是你得付出的
Lindsey, look at me. This is what's involved.

389
00:39:58,055 --> 00:40:00,975
这就是代价  宝贝
This is what it takes, sweetheart.

390
00:40:00,975 --> 00:40:04,415
要是你想在接下来两年内挖掘出你的潜力
If you want to take this as far as
you've got the potential to take it

391
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:08,935
那你就得习惯像蒸汽机一样努力的工作
in the next two years,then you've got to
get used to working like a steam train.

392
00:40:08,935 --> 00:40:10,455
知道吗
Yeah?

393
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:25,295
你到底还想不想去  琳赛
Do you think you're up for it, Lindsey?

394
00:40:25,295 --> 00:40:29,495
要是你不想的话就告诉我  我马上打给国家游泳泳队
Because if you're not,tell me now and
I'll ring British Swimming straight away.

395
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:33,655
我不想浪费我的时间  宝贝
I don't want to waste my time, sweetheart.

396
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:49,375
把手搭在别人肩上什么的
I'm shit at this kind of thing.

397
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:51,415
我最不在行了
The whole arm round the shoulders bit.

398
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:57,015
但是我知道这些对你来说很艰难
But I do know things have been tough for you.

399
00:40:58,535 --> 00:41:00,375
我确实也理解
I do understand that.

400
00:41:03,015 --> 00:41:06,415
但我觉得你要是把这次机会放跑了
I just think that if you blow this opportunity now,

401
00:41:06,415 --> 00:41:09,055
你会后悔一辈子的
you're going to regret it for the rest of your life.

402
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:16,295
你觉得呢
Yeah?

403
00:41:30,235 --> 00:41:31,175
是罗柏的吗
Was it Robert?

404
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:36,775
罗柏・韦斯利  你到底在想什么啊
Robert Wisley, what were you thinking?!

405
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:46,295
你告诉他了吗
Have you told him yet?

406
00:41:49,135 --> 00:41:50,655
你觉得他会怎么说
What do you think he'll say?

407
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:10,375
听着  这句话我只说一次  知道吗
Look, I'm only going to say this once, yeah?

408
00:42:11,895 --> 00:42:14,655
这当然还得看你自己的决定
This is a decision that is absolutely up to you.

409
00:42:17,055 --> 00:42:22,775
但你自己也知道  现在它还只是一个化学物的集合体
But you do know, don't you, that at the minute,
it's not much more than a collection of chemicals.

410
00:42:22,775 --> 00:42:24,775
甚至都还没有成形
It doesn't even have a body, even.

411
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:27,295
这样说好像不合适
Not properly.

412
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:30,135
它现在甚至比乐高的商标都还小
It's smaller than one of them little Lego figures.

413
00:42:35,535 --> 00:42:38,335
要是你现在做流产的话  对你身体也不会有什么影响的
If you wanted an abortion, it wouldn't hurt you,

414
00:42:38,335 --> 00:42:42,615
也不会影响你以后再要孩子
it wouldn't damage you and it wouldn't stop
you from having a baby later on in life,

415
00:42:42,615 --> 00:42:45,575
你要是准备好了就告诉我
say when you're more ready to.

416
00:42:45,575 --> 00:42:47,095
你懂我的意思对吧
Do you know what I mean?

417
00:43:23,535 --> 00:43:25,655
你有心事对吗
You got something going on in your head?

418
00:43:27,175 --> 00:43:29,575
- 没有啊  - 你绝对有
- No. - Yeah, you have.

419
00:43:29,575 --> 00:43:31,295
- 我真没有  - 你肯定有
- I haven't. - Yeah, you have.

420
00:43:31,295 --> 00:43:33,975
你说话的时候眼睛朝左看了
You looked to the left.

421
00:43:33,975 --> 00:43:39,135
你朝右看就是在思考  朝左就是在说谎  你刚才就朝左看了
If you look to the right, you're thinking, you look
to the left, you're lying. You looked to the left.

422
00:43:42,415 --> 00:43:45,135
我发现...
I found out...

423
00:43:45,135 --> 00:43:46,935
呃...  嗯...
Er, erm,

424
00:43:46,935 --> 00:43:49,535
我下周可能要去伦敦
I might be going to London next week.

425
00:43:49,535 --> 00:43:52,815
那儿有一场国际竞赛  而且还有
There's a national competition and there's going to be

426
00:43:52,815 --> 00:43:55,775
国家游泳队的代表队  他们可以决定
a representative from British Swimming there

427
00:43:55,775 --> 00:44:00,735
我是否能进队为12年的奥运会备战
who'll decide if I can go onto the next stage of training for 2012.

428
00:44:00,735 --> 00:44:02,655
什么  奥运会吗
What, the Olympics?

429
00:44:02,655 --> 00:44:04,775
- 为奥运会备战  对  - 去他大爷的
- For the Olympics, yeah. - Fucking hell!

430
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,295
嗯
Yeah.

431
00:44:07,855 --> 00:44:10,775
难怪你那么痛苦了
Well, no wonder you're so miserable, then.

432
00:44:10,775 --> 00:44:14,815
- 什么  - 去他娘的奥运会  那是什么鸟玩意儿
- What?!- Well,the fucking Olympics.How shit is that?

433
00:44:14,815 --> 00:44:16,375
去你大爷的
Fuck you!

434
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:18,015
来吧
Come on.

435
00:44:18,015 --> 00:44:19,655
- 干嘛  - 我要进去了
- What?! - I'm getting in.

436
00:44:19,655 --> 00:44:21,155
- 你什么  - 你怎么还没脱
- You what? - You are an' all.

437
00:44:21,155 --> 00:44:23,255
- 把衣服脱了  - 我泳衣都没带呢
- Get your clothes off. - I ain't got my kit.

438
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:26,615
我们得搞快点  要你那套装备干嘛  我们可是在海里游
We've got to be quick.What do you need your kit for? We're in the sea.

439
00:44:26,615 --> 00:44:28,255

Oh, all right!

440

441
00:44:30,855 --> 00:44:33,215
- 天呐  - 对  就是这样  不错嘛
- Oh, my God! - Yes, well played!

442
00:45:30,815 --> 00:45:32,895
你什么时候定的票
What time did you book it for?

443
00:45:32,895 --> 00:45:34,415
十五分钟前
Quarter past.

470
00:50:34,215 --> 00:50:36,735

And she's going to keep training you, isn't she?

471
00:50:39,735 --> 00:50:42,495

我很爱你  宝贝

514

I can see it, mate, you ain't in control and you want to be.
