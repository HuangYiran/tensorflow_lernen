好汉两个半
第十一季  第九集

11
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,610
我通常都没机会在科技展上认识
I don't usually meet women as beautiful as you

12
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,730
你这么漂亮的美女
at a tech convention.

13
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,000
你嘴真甜
Aw, that's very sweet.

14
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,980
你也是会上最帅的帅哥
And you were definitely the hottest guy there.

15
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,920
谢谢  虽然说
Thank you. Although, to be fair,

16
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,840
当科技展上最帅的男的感觉...
being the hottest guy at a tech convention is kind of like...

17
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,610
就像是在科技展上当最帅的男的...
well, being the hottest guy at a tech convention.

18
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,910
不过有一次我看到贾斯丁・汀布莱克[男星]
Although, once, I saw Justin Timberlake

19
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,370
出席微软的派对呢
at a Microsoft party.

20
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,720
一泡一个准
Lady boner!

21
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,540
他的确是为微软8系统带来了性感元素
Yes, he did bring sexy back to Windows 8.

22
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,840
你说你是在谷歌工作吗
So, you said you work for Google?

23
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,830
是的  在模特[建模]部门
That's right, in the modeling department.

24
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,640
很不错啊  是例如图像渲染
Oh, that's awesome. Like graphic rendering

25
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,800
与3D制图吗
and 3-D imaging?

26
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,740
更像是在指手画脚啦
More like pointing.

27
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,760
"谷歌全新推出
"New from Google,

28
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,330
理解无能的科技玩意"
confusing tech crap."

29
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,140
所以你是真模特
Oh, so you're, like, a model-model?

30
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,730
谷歌谷歌  "鼓"起来高歌
Yep. You can't spell Google without "Ogle."

31
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,720
对吧
Can you?

32
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,450
不对
No, you can't.

33
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,450
但其实我并不想在科技展上当模特
But being a model at tech shows isn't what I really want to do.

34
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,770
只是为了赚钱糊口而已
I just do it to pay the bills.

35
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,600
我懂  那你的终极梦想是什么
Oh, I get it. What's your ultimate goal?

36
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,720
我希望能教人们识字
I want to help teach people to read.

37
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,640
好高尚的梦想  你想当老师啊
Oh, that's noble. So, you want to be a teacher.

38
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,240
我想当下一个字谜游戏的传奇女主持
No, I want to be the next Vanna White.

39
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,360
你是认真的啊
Oh, you're serious.

40
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,010
对啊  你看她有一份好工作
Yeah. I mean, she has an amazing job,

41
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,130
总是穿得超漂亮  发型也超漂亮
she wears amazing outfits and she has amazing hair.

42
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,510
某人也超需要学个新形容词啊
Somebody needs to buy a new, amazing adjective.

43
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,010
你不能买形容词
You can't buy adjectives.

44
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,200
你只能买母音[节目游戏规则]
You can only buy vowels.

45
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,360
好的
Right.

46
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,650
只能卖母音
Only vowels.

47
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,730
我还欠你一杯饮料
Well, I owe you another drink.

48
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,000
O  K[猜字]
"O." "K."

49
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,360
今晚不会有I[我]进入U[你]的事情发生了
Certainly won't be any "I" in "U" Tonight.

50
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,480
那个妞真是美呆了
Wow, that girl is gorgeous.

51
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,780
她是个模特儿
Yeah, she's a model.

52
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,220
我们之间不来电
We don't really have a connection.

53
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,480
她脑子不太好
She's not very bright.

54
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,200
我觉得她会认为矽谷是一个
I think she thinks Silicon Valley is the place

55
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,490
女人去做矽胶假奶的地方
where women go to get a boob job.

56
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,150
你想要有智力上的刺激啊
Oh, you want intellectual stimulation.

57
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,920
那你何不一边看着科研节目
Uh, why don't you watch an episode of Nova

58
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,190
一边操翻她呢
while you're banging her brains out?

59
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,550
我要去跟她说我们不来电了
No, I'm gonna go tell her it's not gonna work out.

60
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,410
你不想上她  能让给我吗
Well, if you don't want her, can I have her?

61
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,880
行啊  我们互换衣服  她一定"认不出"
Oh, sure, let's change shirts. Maybe she won't notice.

62
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,520
她真笨成这样啊
Oh, she's that dumb?

63
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,900
太好了
Great.

64
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,200
沃顿
Walden!

65
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,280
有海鸥...
Look, a seagu...

66
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,920
天啊
Oh, my God.

67
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,360
等等
Wait.

68
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,100
我们还没互换衣服呢
We didn't switch shirts yet.

69
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,630
在干嘛呢
Hey, what's going on?

70
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,160
刚才在清理我的衣橱
I was cleaning out my closet

71
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,810
发现了一箱杰克的旧东西
and I found a box of Jake's old stuff.

72
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,230
那挺好啊
Aw, that's sweet.

73
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,340
谁是杰克啊
Who's Jake?

74
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,790
我儿子  你堂弟
My son. Y-Your cousin.

75
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,400
对哦
Oh, right.

76
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,920
他是怎么死的
Oh, and how did he die?

77
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,060
他没死呢  他参军去了
Oh, no, h-he's not dead. He's in the Army.

78
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,430
好烟斗
Ah. Nice bong.

79
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,610
想必他打的不是抗毒的战争
Guess he's not fighting the war on drugs.

80
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,050
那是蜂鸟喂食器
No, that-that is a hummingbird feeder.

81
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,680
他在美术课上做的
He made it in art class.

82
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,920
手工艺课上  我也做了一个火车笛
And in shop class, I made a train whistle.

83
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,190
呜呜[大麻  大麻]
Weed, weed!

84
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,750
我不是开玩笑
No, no, seriously.

85
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,230
在他读高中时的有一年暑假
Uh, one summer, back in high school,

86
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,630
他跟他朋友喜欢上了赏鸟
he and his friends got into bird watching.

87
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,760
他们会一整天都在森林里混...
They'd spend all day out in the woods, and they'd...

88
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,200
笑开怀地回家
they'd come back laughing and...

89
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,600
天啊  我真是个傻逼
Oh, God, I'm an idiot.

90
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,080
别担心  所有家长都是傻逼
Don't worry. All parents are idiots.

91
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,820
我妈以前也以为我只是被反锁在浴室里
My mom used to think I was locked in the bathroom all day

92
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,440
然后里面有只电动牙刷
with an electric toothbrush.

93
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,240
我第一任妻子也总是在用她的电动牙...
My first wife was always using her electric tooth...

94
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,180
天啊  我是超级大傻逼
God, I am an idiot.

95
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,910
你看  他以前的成绩单
Oh, look at this. One of his old report cards.

96
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,760
还看得到他想偷换成绩的印子
Oh, you can still see where he tried to change his grades.

97
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,950
他把所有的C
Yeah, he changed the C's.

98
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,040
都换成了D
To D's.

99
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,140
不过那年接他的校车的确换成接智障的小校车
Yeah. That was the year his bus got a little shorter.

100
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,480
不过  也不是那么坏
But, you know, in his defense,

101
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,000
他的老师那年也有变化
his teacher changed that year, too.

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,080
也从C变成了D[罩杯]
She went from C's to D's.

103
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,450
你晚上都是干这种无聊事度过的吗
Is this how you're spending your night?

104
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,190
不不  等会我还打算刮背毛
Oh, no, no. Later, I'm going to shave my back.

105
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,630
如果你不忙的话...
Oh, actually, if you're not busy...

106
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,610
我忙  你也得忙
I am. And so are you.

107
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,230
我要去喝酒  沃顿呢
I'm gonna get a drink. Where's Walden?

108
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,070
他得把他的女伴送去医院
Oh, he had to take his date to the hospital.

109
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,530
有东西卡在她身体里的哪个洞里了吗
Ooh, what are they pulling out, and from where?

110
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,470
不是你想的那样
No, it-it's nothing like that.

111
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,720
她当时在看天空  然后摔下了阳台
She was looking up at the sky and she fell off the deck.

112
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,990
-嗑药了吗  -没有
- High? - No.

113
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,110
-喝醉了吗  -没有
- Drunk? - No.

114
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,640
-模特吗  -是的
- Model? - Yeah.

115
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,620
你还好吗
How you feeling?

116
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,690
我没事
I'm all right.

117
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,850
我们得填一下这个表
Uh, well, we need to fill out this paperwork.

118
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,480
名字是  纳丁
So, uh, first name, Nadine.

119
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,170
这有点尴尬  我不知道你的姓
This is awkward. I don't know your last name.

120
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,880
是H  O  R  E
It's H-O-R-E.

121
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,720
H  O  R  E
H-o-r-e.

122
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,500
音似胡儿[欢呼]吗
Like "Hooray"?

123
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,130
不  音似霍尔[妓女]
No, like "Whore."

124
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,890
你觉得我该改吗
You think I should change it?

125
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,510
不  你该自豪
No, be proud.

126
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,480
这名字可是从你祖上流传下来的  霍尔
I'm sure you come from a long line of... Hores.

127
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,380
你这里有亲戚吗
Uh, any relatives I can call?

128
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,990
没有  他们都在东边
No, they're all back east.

129
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,700
洛杉矶只有我一个霍尔[妓女]
I'm the only Hore in Los Angeles.

130
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,350
我还是保留意见吧
Agree to disagree.

131
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,850
紧急情况联系人  没有家人的话
Emergency contacts. Okay, so no family.

132
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,720
那你有朋友吗  室友呢
Uh, friends? Roommates?

133
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,450
除了初次约会对象  有其他熟人吗
Anyone you've gone on more than one date with?

134
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,480
没有
Not really.

135
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,720
我一个人住
I live alone.

136
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,870
我来洛杉矶没几周
I've only been in L.A. a couple weeks.

137
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,320
我认识的男人只有你和弗兰克
The only men in my life are you and Frank.

138
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,410
好吧  那弗兰克的联系方式是...
Oh, all right. How do I get a hold of Frank?

139
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,720
他是头猪[坏男人]
He's a pig.

140
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,550
他是猪  你是霍尔[鸡]
He's a pig, you're a Hore.

141
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,220
没人会说三道四的
No one's judging.

142
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,930
不  它是我的宠物猪
No, he's my pet pig.

143
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,280
我的小猪肠
My little frankfurter.

144
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,830
一只猪啊
A pig.

145
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,320
他睡在毛毯里吗
Does he sleep in a blanket?

146
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,200
是啊  他每次都会把毛毯顶起来
Yeah, he totally hogs the covers.

147
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,060
"顶"起来  说得好
Hogs. Good one.

148
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,160
当我没说
Never mind.

149
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,750
那药物呢
Uh, what about medications?

150
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,380
超爱的
Love 'em.

151
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,450
不是  我是问"现在有在服用其他药物"
No, I-I think they mean "Are you taking any now?"

152
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,810
我相信啊  我有在吃治疗抑郁症的药
Oh, let's see, there's plaxitril for my depression,

153
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,770
治疗焦虑症的药
zaxaprin for my anxiety,

154
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,020
治疗失眠的药
dilapamin for my insomnia,

155
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,610
还有治疗间歇性失控行为的药
and clodex for my occasional bouts of rage.

156
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,910
谁都不喜欢愤怒的霍尔[妓女]
No one likes an angry Hore.

157
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,190
你怎么不早说咱们来的是同志酒吧
Why didn't you tell me we were going to a gay bar?

158
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,840
我要是早告诉你  你肯定不来了
'Cause if I told you, you wouldn't have come.

159
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,120
我肯定会来  而且会穿得更好看点
Yes, I would. I just would've dressed better.

160
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,400
不过先说清楚
And just to be clear,

161
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,070
你知道我不是同性恋吧
you do know I'm not gay, right?

162
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,590
我觉得你不是同性恋啊
I don't think you're gay.

163
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,730
虽然我也认识很多行为爷们
I-I mean, do I know guys that act less gay

164
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,560
但是会跟男人做爱的男人
that have sex with other guys? Sure.

165
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,520
不过我知道你是直男
But I know you're straight.

166
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,180
那你带我来干什么
So, why bring me here?

167
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,270
你扫一眼这里
Look around this room.

168
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,170
-看到那些女人了吗  -看到了
- See all the women here? - Yeah.

169
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,500
有些女人是同性恋  她们是我的
Well, some of them are gay. Those are mine.

170
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,840
剩下的就是异性恋
The rest are straight.

171
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,810
当然  其中也有一些是我的
Some of those are mine, too.

172
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,200
最后落单的那些女人
And everyone who's left

173
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,780
在打烊的时候就会喝得烂醉如泥  欲火焚身
is gonna be drunk and horny by the end of the night

174
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,630
然后会寻找那些不觉得阴道很"不好吃"的人
and looking for someone who doesn't think vaginas are yucky.

175
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,630
原来你是在说我
Oh, oh, you mean me.

176
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,900
好棒哦
Yay.

177
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,540
我是说  不错
I mean, yay.

178
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,110
小心点
Okay, be careful.

179
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,640
小心腿
Watch your leg.

180
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,860
-你身上好香  -谢谢
- You smell so good. - Thank you.

181
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,040
让我来尝尝你的味道
Let's see how you taste.

182
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,520
行了  行了
Okay. All right.

183
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,380
看来止痛药有效果了
I see the painkillers have kicked in.

184
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,990
当然有效果
Oh, they sure did.

185
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,010
现在  你可以对我做任何事
Right now, you could do anything to me

186
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,000
而且我都不会记得哦
and I wouldn't remember.

187
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,160
刚我抛媚眼了吗  我想抛来着
Did I wink? 'Cause I was trying to wink.

188
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,940
行了  你先去沙发上坐会吧
Okay, let's-let's get you on the couch, huh?

189
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,810
-那你在我身上"做"会吧  -好吧
- Hey, let's get you on Nadine. - Oh, okay.

190
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,190
行了  先  先歇一会吧
All right, fine. Let's... just rest.

191
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,360
真的很感谢你照顾我
Thank you so much for taking care of me.

192
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,860
毕竟  你断了一条腿
Well, you have a broken leg.

193
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,720
而且没有家人  没有朋友
You don't have any family or friends

194
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,940
而且你住在四楼  还没有电梯
and you live on the fourth floor of a building with no elevator.

195
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,210
我总不能把你扔在大街上吧
So, I couldn't just leave you on the street.

196
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,420
可以吗
Could I?

197
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,250
-你好帅哦  -我知道
- You're handsome. - Yeah.

198
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,450
你...在流口水
You're... drooling.

199
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,790
我去给你拿点吃的
I'm gonna get you some food.

200
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,450
好吧  不过我饮食有忌口
All right, but I have certain dietary constrictions.

201
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,340
我不吃小麦  不吃乳制品  也不吃带脸的
I don't eat wheat, dairy, or anything with a face.

202
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,670
不过
Although...

203
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,180
我可以为了你破戒
I would make an exception for you.

204
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,570
所以你跟侄女一起来的吗
So, you're here with your niece?

205
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,780
是啊  她最近刚出柜
Uh, yeah, she just recently came out of the closet

206
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,130
而且她非常害羞
and she's painfully shy.

207
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,780
这才叫母乳喂养[吮吸胸部]
Now, that's what I call breast-feeding.

208
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,120
她还在慢慢适应的过程中
She's, uh, still trying to find her gay legs.

209
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,100
是吗  所幸她叔叔已经完全适应了
Ah. Well, she's lucky she has an uncle who's found his.

210
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,030
不  我是直男
No, I'm straight.

211
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,780
为什么大家都觉得我是同性恋
Why does everybody think I'm gay?

212
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,830
哎哟  这个好酸哦
Oh, that is way too tart.

213
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,250
宝拉
Um, so, Paula,

214
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,240
你是做什么的
what do you do?

215
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,300
我是个投资银行家
I'm an investment banker.

216
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,060
那你能不能回答我一个一直想问的问题
Oh, okay, maybe you can answer a question I've always had.

217
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,840
提前取款[抽出]有什么后果吗
What's the penalty for early withdrawal?

218
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,940
这要看情况
Well, uh, that depends.

219
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,520
你的"存款"有多大
How big is your deposit?

220
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,940
利息[性趣]多"起来"了
Oh, interest is rising.

221
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,940
其实呢  在"里面"存得越久
You know, the longer you keep it in,

222
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,870
"收益"就会越多
the bigger your reward.

223
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,680
可是有时  市场会"疲软倒下"
Sometimes, the market collapses

224
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,700
而你却也无力改变
and there's nothing you can do about it.

225
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,720
等一下  这段对话到底是性暗示
Uh, wait. Are-are we doing sexual innuendo

226
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,520
还是你在咨询我免费的理财建议
or are you asking for free financial advice?

227
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,400
不能两者皆是吗
Why can't it be both?

228
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,020
其实  如果你有兴趣的话
You know, if you're interested,

229
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,710
我在马里布海滩有栋别墅
I've got a Malibu beach house.

230
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,030
如果你有兴趣的话  我没什么道德底线
Well, if you're interested, I've got very loose morals.

231
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,590
好棒哦
Yay.

232
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,420
应该是  不错
I mean, yay.

233
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,660
刚刚好爽哦
That was amazing.

234
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,170
你不喜欢吗  我可以做得更好的
Wait, it wasn't? 'Cause I can do better.

235
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,010
不  你做得很好
No, you were great.

236
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,700
谢天谢地  因为刚才就做到最好了
Oh, thank God, 'cause I can't do better.

237
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,350
不过有件事在上床前
But there is something I probably should've told you

238
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,710
我就应该告诉你的
before we slept together.

239
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,350
是有老公了  还是有性病
Oh, God, husband or herpes?

240
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,630
有个男人  他叫保罗
Well, there was another guy. Paul.

241
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,200
保罗  宝拉  肯定不容易分清
Paul. Paula. That must have been confusing...

242
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,530
是啊
Very, yeah. Um...

243
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,490
其实  在40岁以前
You see, for the first 40 years of my life,

244
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,050
我是一个叫保罗的男人
I was a man named Paul.

245
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,590
你看起来不像...40岁
You don't look... 40.

246
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,770
这么说  你以前也是个男人
So, so, you were a guy?

247
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,970
也有喉结和胡子吗
With, you know, an Adam's apple and facial hair,

248
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,370
还有下面那整套装备吗
and the whole kit and kaboodle?

249
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,020
是的  那整套装备我都有
Yep, I had a kit and two kaboodles.

250
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,820
那你怎么变成这样了
So, so, how did you get that?

251
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,690
我是说  你用找人捐赠器官吗
I mean, did you have to get a donor?

252
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,480
拿驾照要填以后捐不捐器官的时候
'Cause I've never seen that box

253
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,440
我没见过有捐"那部分"的选项啊
to check on a driver's license.

254
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,890
事实上  是我把器官捐给别人了
Actually, uh, I-I... I donated my own organ.

255
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,320
我要做的就是切掉鸡鸡  懂吗
You see, what they do, they take your penis, all right?

256
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,950
对准中央  一刀切下
They slice it right down the middle...

257
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,870
好吧  我蛋蛋具体经历了什么
Okay, I'll-I'll spare you the details

258
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,710
就不给你讲那么详细了
on what happened to my balls.

259
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,060
我倒清楚我蛋蛋怎么了
Well, I know what just happened to mine.

260
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,540
我知道应该早点告诉你的
Look, I-I know I should have told you earlier.

261
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,510
我只是不想把你吓跑  我真的喜欢你
I just didn't want to scare you away. I really like you.

262
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,620
我也喜欢你  我们有很多相似之处
Oh, and I like you. I mean, we have a lot in common.

263
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,640
而且比我知道的还"多"
Clearly more than I realized.

264
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,380
或许我该离开
Maybe it's best if I go.

265
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,710
不  不  不要走
Oh, no, no, don't do.

266
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,520
你确定吗
You sure?

267
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,780
对啊  别走  我喜欢你
Yeah, yeah, no, I like you.

268
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,540
我只是在尽力消化这件事
I'm just, I'm trying to process this whole thing.

269
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,430
我是说  比如
I mean, for instance,

270
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,660
你的鸡鸡不会再长回来了  对吧
there's no chance it'll grow back, right?

271
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,410
就像蜥蜴的尾巴那样吗
What, like-like a salamander's tail?

272
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,380
不会
No. Uh-uh.

273
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,820
你不会有一天打喷嚏用力过猛
So one day you're not gonna, you know, sneeze real hard

274
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,760
突然把鸡鸡喷出来吧
and suddenly I'm dating a dude?

275
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,180
艾伦  我跟你以前的女人没有区别
Alan, I am as much a woman as you've ever dated.

276
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,010
但是如果你不能接受我的过去  那...
But if you're not okay with this, it's...

277
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,280
不  不  算了
No, no, no, you know what?

278
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,530
我不会让一点小事影响我们的关系
I am not going to let one little thing come between us.

279
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,090
我那"事"可不算小
Oh, it wasn't little.

280
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,110
宝拉  算是两性关系建议吧
Okay, uh, Paula, bit of, uh, relationship advice?

281
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,660
没有一个男人希望听到
Uh, no guy likes to hear

282
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,290
女朋友的鸡鸡比他大
that his girlfriend had a bigger penis than he does.

283
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,930
你说得对
You're right.

284
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,300
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

285
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,570
保重身体[德语]
Gesundheit.

286
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,490
-早安  -早安
-Morning. -Morning.

287
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,600
妈的  培根没了
Oh great, we're out of bacon.

288
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,760
裸体超模也没了
We're out of naked Heidi Klum.

289
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,370
靠
Damn.

290
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,750
这是弗兰克  是我女伴纳丁养的宠物
That's Frank. He belongs to my date Nadine.

291
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,020
艾伦跟我说了
Alan told me about her.

292
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,200
就是那个被你带去急诊室的模特
That's the model you took to the emergency room.

293
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,510
而且是两次  她称之为我们的"定情地"
Twice. She calls it our "special place."

294
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,750
这是我人生中最糟糕的一次约会
It's the worst date of my life.

295
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,520
你撑烂了她的嘴吗
Is her mouth broken?

296
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,050
不是
No.

297
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,380
那问题是什么
So what's the problem?

298
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,350
问题在于  我们不来电
The problem is, we have no connection.

299
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,180
如果不爱一个女人的心灵
How can I be attracted to a woman's body

300
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,880
又怎能爱上她的身体呢
if I'm not attracted to her mind?

301
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,940
听起来有点像同性恋  不过也没什么
Sounds kind of gay, but all right.

302
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,800
早啊  沃顿
Hey, Walden.

303
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,490
珍妮
Jenny.

304
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,650
废柴[艾伦]
Zippy.

305
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,610
友情提示  有个女孩睡在沙发上
Just a heads-up, there's a girl asleep on the couch.

306
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,650
放心老板  我知道怎么做
Don't worry, I know the drill, boss.

307
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,380
给她500块  搜她身上有没有偷银具
Give her 500 bucks, pat her down for silverware

308
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,450
然后丢进计程车
and throw her in a taxi.

309
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,930
什么
What?

310
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,200
抱歉  突然想到了查理
Sorry. Charlie flashback.

311
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,360
早上好
Morning.

312
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,180
这是一头猪啊
That's a pig.

313
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,070
这是一只吸血虫啊
Whoa! That's a leech.

314
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,950
说来话长  离谱的一晚
Long story, crazy night.

315
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,530
不管有没有猪  你都没我离谱
Pig or no pig, not as crazy as mine.

316
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,860
100块赌我比你离谱
100 bucks says mine beats yours.

317
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,170
我跟一个曾经是男人的女人上床了
I had sex with a woman who used to be a man.

318
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,320
胜负见分晓啦
And we have a winner.

319
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,670
真的吗
What, really?

320
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,770
我不相信你会...
I can't believe that you would...

321
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,980
不过转念一想  也不出奇
Well, ah, then again, it's you.

322
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,010
随你怎么说
Hey, hey, say what you want,

323
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,590
但她真的很懂怎么侍候男人
but she really knows her way around a man.

324
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,460
就像跟优秀的西藏向导一起爬珠峰
It's like climbing Mount Everest with a really good Sherpa.

325
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,220
是啊  但你不和西藏向导上床啊
Yeah, but you don't shtup the Sherpa.

326
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,150
怎么变性啊  那玩意去哪儿了呢
How did it work? Like, where did it... go?

327
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,840
很容易的  只需
Oh, that's easy. See, what they do is,

328
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,590
对准中央  一刀切下
they slice the penis down the middle...

329
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,720
沃顿
Walden?

330
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,230
我能不能洗个澡呢
Is there somewhere I can take a bath?

331
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,480
当然  在楼上  我来帮你
Oh, yeah, upstairs. Here, I'll help you.

332
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,650
不
No.

333
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,930
如果我什么事都靠你
I will never get out of here

334
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,390
就永远不能离开这里
if I don't start to do things on my own.

335
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,920
除非你不想让我离开
Unless you don't want me to leave.

336
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,500
楼上  左手边
Top of the stairs, on the left.

337
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,530
这个女孩伤得太重了
That girl is really messed up.

338
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,320
我那位唯一让我不爽的
The only thing wrong with mine

339
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,460
就是她偶尔新长出的胡须
is the occasional five o'clock shadow.

340
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,390
我要说  艾伦
You know, I've got to say, Alan,

341
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,240
你和一个术后变性人约会
you going out with a post-op transgendered person

342
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,590
而心中没有任何偏见
without any judgment--

343
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,690
我觉得很赞
very enlightened.

344
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,730
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

345
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,050
你该见识见识她的咪咪
And you should see her boobs.

346
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,150
一个叫霍尔[妓女]的打来电话
You're getting a call from a "Hore?"

347
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,550
喂  纳丁
Hi, Nadine.

348
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,690
你把它卡到哪里了
You got... you got it stuck where?

349
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,020
不要动  我马上过去
Don't move, I'll be right there.

350
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,490
纳丁的护靴卡到楼梯扶栏里了
Nadine got her boot caught in the banister.

351
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,480
失陪了
Excuse me.

352
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,550
不用了  我搞定了
Never mind, I got it.

353
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,320
给个500块加计程车费  他早脱身了
500 bucks and cab fare, and he'd be out of this.

354
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,050
真不敢相信我们这么容易就选定电影了
I can't believe how easily we agreed on a movie.

355
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,410
就是啊  男人和女人总是很难达成一致
I know, men and women aren't usually on the same page.

356
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,550
就是这里
Oh, oh, here it is.

357
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,600
三号厅  《茱丽娅・罗伯茨我爱你》
Uh, theater three, Julia Roberts in Hashtag: I Love You.

358
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,230
我去买汽水  你要不要来点什么
Listen, I'm gonna get a soda. Do you want something?

359
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,820
当然  我看看我想吃什么
Oh, sure. Uh, oh, let me see what I'm in the mood for.

360
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,670
想分着吃热狗吗[剪开鸡鸡]
Oh, uh, want to split a hot dog?

361
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,270
太对不起了
Oh, I am so sorry.

362
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,390
没事
It's fine.

363
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,030
你好  麻烦给我两杯健怡可乐
Hi. Uh, can we have two Diet Cokes

364
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,480
一份热狗
and a hot dog, please?

365
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,360
不用了  我来
Don't worry, I got it.

366
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,520
好吧  但我习惯了男人付钱
Okay, but I'm used to paying.

367
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,690
这真是太奇怪了
This is... this is so weird.

368
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,850
对不起  这是保罗的旧习惯
Sorry, just, you know, old habits from when I was Paul.

369
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,620
我希望你没有意见
I-I hope you're okay with that.

370
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,750
我想很明显我很乐意
I think it's pretty clear that I'm willing

371
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,620
适应这段关系
to work around things in this relationship.

372
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:20,980
太感谢了
Well, I appreciate it,

373
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,970
因为我和你在一起很开心
because I'm having a great time with you.

374
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,250
我也是
Oh, well, so am I.

375
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,690
但往后  你得学会
Uh, but going forward, you're gonna have to learn

376
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,410
适应我的男子气概  接受这个事实
to embrace my masculinity and, you know, accept the fact

377
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,660
我才是  谢谢  
that I'm the-- thank you--

378
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,250
这段关系里的男性角色
man in this relationship.

379
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,950
这里好冷
Oh, it's chilly in here.

380
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,330
给  外套给你
Oh, here. Take my jacket.

381
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,450
好温暖哦
Oh. Cozy.

382
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,380
是谁
Who's there?

383
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,350
是我  小傻瓜
It's just me, silly.

384
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,330
你还好吗
Is everything all right?

385
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,080
你把我照顾得这么好
You've taken such good care of me,

386
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,150
我想是时候
I thought it was time for me

387
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,710
我来好好"照顾"你
to take good care of you.

388
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,830
没这个必要
Oh, that's not necessary.

389
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,000
为什么
Why not?

390
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,700
我们可以扮医生
We could play doctor.

391
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,910
你看医生还没看够吗
Haven't you seen enough doctors?

392
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,800
好吧  我们扮演帕特和瓦娜
Okay, we could play Pat and Vanna.

393
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,120
线索是  人们脱光了做的事
The clue is "Things people do naked."

394
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,610
纳丁  别这样
Okay, Nadine, just stop.

395
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,660
有什么不对
What's wrong?

396
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,270
我不会和你上床的
We're not gonna sleep together.

397
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,830
你是说
Are you saying

398
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,540
你不想要这个尤物吗
that you don't want any of this?

399
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,890
不想  一百万个不情愿
"N," And I'd like to buy five O's.

400
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,200
我们之间不来电
Look, we-we just don't click.

401
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,700
你居然这样误导我
I can't believe you led me on.

402
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,260
哪有  我是让你进门  帮助你
Led you on? I let you in. I was trying to help you.

403
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,440
我看起来需要你的帮助吗
Do I look like I need your help?

404
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,420
喂  我没做什么
Yeah? No, I'm not doing anything.

405
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,630
不是吧
Seriously?

406
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,050
就是啊  我应该出个声
I know, I know. I should say something.

407
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,360
不  算了
No, no, it's fine.

408
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,300
我看完电影后过去
I'll come over after the movie.

409
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,840
他现在就该走
He should go now.

410
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,450
你说什么
What's that?

411
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,990
无视他就行  你搭理他
Just ignore him. People can only make you angry

412
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,190
只会让你生气 
with your permission.

413
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,510
好  但如果他再开口  我就去找引座员
Right. But if he opens his mouth again, I will get the usher.

414
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,970
我的影评就是
I got my review.

415
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,680
#一部烂片
Hashtag piece of crap.

416
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,270
好吧  受够了
All right, you know what? That's it.

417
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,790
慢着  别这样  让我来
Oh, wait, oh, no, no, no, Let me do this.

418
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,800
艾伦  你不用这么做 
Alan, Alan, you don't have to do this.

419
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,120
我是男人
Yes, I do. I'm the man

420
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,370
这是男人做的事  帮我拿着果胶软糖
and this is what a man does. Now, hold my Jujubes.

421
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,550
-不好意思  先生  -什么事
- Uh, excuse me, sir? - What?

422
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,960
大家在看电影呢
Um, uh, we're all trying to watch the movie

423
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,160
我不知道你是否记得
and I don't know if you remember what the, uh,

424
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,500
卡通爆米花桶提醒过
the little cartoon popcorn bucket said,

425
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,420
沉默是金
but "Silence is golden."

426
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,080
是吗  你想怎样
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do about it?

427
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,350
我已经做了
Uh, well, I just did it

428
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,150
但没啥成效  所以...  
and it didn't seem very effective, so...

429
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,220
回去坐下吧
Go sit down.

430
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,900
知道吗  不如你坐下吧
Okay, you know what? Why don't you sit down?

431
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,970
搞什么  搞什么
What the... What...

432
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,450
对不起
I'm sorry.

433
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,070
不用道歉
Don't apologize.

434
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,750
宝拉  我爱你
Paula? Hashtag I love you.

435
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,610
我还以为这段关系能够有结果[去哪里]
I thought this relationship was going somewhere.

436
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,260
你说真的吗  这段关系唯一去的地方
Okay, seriously? The only place this relationship is going

437
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,030
就是急诊室
is the emergency room.

438
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,940
我以为咱们之间是特别的
I thought this was something special.

439
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,210
我以为我会成为纳丁・霍尔施密特[马屎]夫人
I thought I was going to be Mrs. Nadine Hore-Schmidt.

440
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,020
这也太疯狂了
Okay, this is crazy.

441
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,130
如果你没有从我家阳台上掉下去
I mean, we wouldn't have gotten past the first date

442
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,830
我们第一次约会早不了了之了
if you hadn't fallen off my deck.

443
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,570
没错
That's right.

444
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,230
我的确从你家阳台上掉下去了
I did fall off your deck.

445
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,840
我会向我的律师提到这点的
I'll be sure to mention that to my lawyer.

446
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,810
你的律师
Your lawyer?

447
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,920
没错
You heard me.

448
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,040
也许你在巴士车身上见过他的照片
Perhaps you've seen his picture on the side of the bus?

449
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,680
成为顶级意外事故律师
You don't get to be the numero uno accidente lawyer

450
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,460
可不是靠意外的
by accident.

451
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,200
走吧  弗兰克
Come on, Frank.

452
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,090
你多保重  弗兰克
Take care of yourself, Frank.

453
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,470
出什么事了
What's going on?

454
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,260
纳丁准备告我  
Oh, Nadine is going to sue me

455
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,890
因为我不愿意和她上床 
because I won't sleep with her.

456
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,870
还有这种事啊
Oh, that's a thing?

457
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,500
别告诉艾伦
Don't tell Alan.

458
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,890
不可能吧
Oh, that can't be.

459
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,360
你好  纳丁
Hi, Nadine.

460
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,180
我马上过去
I'll be right there.

461
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,750
纳丁被巴士撞了
Nadine got hit by a bus.

462
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,490
又要回到我和她的定情地了
Back to our special place.

463
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,750
你想看什么
What do you want to watch?

464
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,130
我知道有人想再看一遍《小猪宝贝》
I know someone wants to watch Babe again.
