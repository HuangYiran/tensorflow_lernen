1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,060
- Hey, can I ask you a question?  - Sure.

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,030
You've had this dart board since I've known you,

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,400
but I've never seen you play.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,360
Oh, uh, we played... once.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,830
I broke a window.

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,030
What window?

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,800
That one over there.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,330
Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?

9
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,660
Skee-Ball tickets?

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,860
Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago?

11
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,000
I finally decided what prize I want.

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,260
Hurry up.

13
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,900
Uh, if I still have them,

14
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,960
they're probably in the junk box.

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,260
Ooh, what are you gonna get?

16
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,460
None of your business.

17
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,900
But when you see me wearing a flower

18
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,160
in my lapel later,

19
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,300
you are most welcome to sniff it.

20
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,560
Yup, oh... here you go.

21
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,960
Oh, thank you.

22
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,900
Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles.

23
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,930
Oh.

24
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,330
Oh-ho.

25
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,600
I forgot about this.

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,800
My aunt made it for me when I started college.

27
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,430
Aw, did she hate you?

28
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,330
Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater,

29
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,200
and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite.

30
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,600
Yeah, I seem to be a few tickets short.

31
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,100
Are there more in the box?

32
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,730
Hmm, I think I got them all.

33
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,160
Nope, they're not in there.

34
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,260
Well, you barely looked. Let me see.

35
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,830
No, no, no, I... I looked, and...

36
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,060
no more tickets.

37
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,200
Leonard, let me look in the box.

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,430
Okay, okay!

39
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,730
I'm gonna show you what's in the box.

40
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,530
But just... promise not to flip out.

41
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,230
Why would I flip out?

42
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,600
Is it a spider?

43
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,830
It's a spider!

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,630
No, if it was a spider,

45
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,100
Lenny would've flipped out.

46
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,160
Okay, Sheldon,

47
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,600
I know I was supposed to return

48
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,200
this DVD a long time ago,

49
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,300
and I know we rented it

50
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,400
on your card.

51
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,430
But it's been, like, seven years

52
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,500
and clearly nothing bad has happened.

53
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,860
So in... in... in... instead of being

54
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,500
a giant pain in the ass like you always are,

55
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,660
what if

56
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,830
this one time you just tried staying calm?

57
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,400
That seems like a reasonable request.

58
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,260
Although so did, "Hey, Leonard, would you mind

59
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,260
returning that DVD?"

60
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,130
I'm sorry. I'll... I'll take care of it.

61
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,630
Okay.

62
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,530
I mean it, I'm going to.

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,360
I believe you.

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,630
And you're going to stay calm?

65
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,860
I said I would.

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,130
How about that?

67
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,400
Sheldon's being reasonable.

68
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,430
Yeah, it's freaking me out.

69
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,560
I'm gonna go.

70
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,000
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,300
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

72
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,960
* The Earth began to cool *

73
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,660
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

74
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,160
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

75
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,860
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

76
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,760
* That all started with a big bang *

77
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,760

80
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,400
So... when you say

81
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,360
you're not going to freak out about the DVD,

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,000
here's what that means.

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,330
Don't fixate on it.

84
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,360
Don't wake me up in the middle of the night.

85
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,230
Or nag me through the door

86
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,700
while I'm on the toilet.

87
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,360
Okay, first, talking to you while you're on the toilet

88
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,230
isn't exactly a picnic for me either, okay?

89
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,530
Remember...

90
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,100
when you can hear me, I can hear you.

91
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,430
And second...

92
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,900
you completely disregard

93
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,260
how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me.

94
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,330
It's... it's like, a...

95
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,760
an itch in my brain I can't scratch.

96
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,600
When I broke my arm I used

97
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,260
to stick a coat hanger down there.

98
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,430
You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?

99
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,000
You wouldn't make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,160
Well, I don't know how to do that.

101
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,500
How about this?

102
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,260
I promise I won't pester you about the DVD.

103
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,430
You can defecate in peace.

104
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,000
That's a win for both of us.

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,460
But...

106
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,930
until this matter is resolved,

107
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,500
I would like you

108
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,530
to wear this sweater.

109
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,400
With nothing underneath it.

110
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,660
That's stupid.

111
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,930
Why?

112
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,060
You say it's itchy and uncomfortable.

113
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,830
I say situations like this make me feel the same way.

114
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm telling you, try the hanger.

115
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,730
Put it on.

116
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,960
Let's share the experience.

117
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,300
You got it.

118
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,730
If this sweater shuts you up,

119
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,100
I'm gonna make a fortune

120
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,000
selling them to everyone we know.

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,100
Now...

122
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,360
all I need to do

123
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,100
is head down to the video store

124
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,030
and return the DVD.

125
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,360
Oh, did I forget to tell you?

126
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,900
That store went out of business years ago.

127
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,060
Really?

128
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,760
How those nipples feeling, chief?

129
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,560
Penny, can we please get our drinks?

130
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,960
Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.

131
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,300
At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.

132
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,600
Cool. At my lab,

133
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,460
I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections.

134
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,830
I scraped gum off the bottom of that table.

135
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,760
Only because my manager saw me put it there.

136
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,730
Oh, my gosh.

137
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,760
That's the girl that broke Rajesh's heart.

138
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,130
That's Lucy?

139
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,060
I don't know why but I always pictured her as Indian.

140
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,800
I think that reason's called racism.

141
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,600
I'm gonna go talk to her.

142
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,430
Why? What are you gonna say?

143
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,560
I'm not gonna say anything.

144
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,830
I just want to check her out

145
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,900
because she hurt my friend.

146
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,530
My Indian friend.

147
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,030
Who's racist now?

148
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,030
You because you just called him

149
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,130
your "Indian friend."

150
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,630
Yeah, well, you're short.

151
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,800
We're never getting our drinks.

152
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,800
No, but we knew that.

153
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,100
Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?

154
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,460
Oh, water would be great.

155
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,530
Okay.

156
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,860
Um, you're Lucy, right?

157
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,460
I'm a friend of Raj Koothrappali's.

158
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,100
Actually Amy recognized you.

159
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,530
Wow.

160
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,030
How's he doing?

161
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,460
Oh, you know, he's good.

162
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,630
Great.

163
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,730
Yeah, this is none of my business.

164
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,130
But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?

165
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,760
Oh, I don't know.

166
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,430
I guess I thought it would be easier.

167
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,160
Yeah, I get that.

168
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,500
I'll go get you your water.

169
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,930
When you say "easier,"

170
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,700
you mean easier for you, right?

171
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,900
Because it certainly didn't make it easier for him.

172
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,630
Any chance I can get

173
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,160
a different waitress?

174
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,260
I... I'm sorry, this is rude of me.

175
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,330
I will go get that water.

176
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,300
See, see, see, see.

177
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,660
Just now you expressed your feelings to my face.

178
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,560
How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?

179
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,960
I don't know your e-mail.

180
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,530
You know what the worst part is?

181
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,860
You're sitting here, perfectly happy

182
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,860
and he's at home, a blubbering mess.

183
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,360
Oh, I thought you said he was okay.

184
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,600
Well, I also said I was getting you water,

185
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,360
but look at me still standing here.

186
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,330
You know, I may be a bad waitress,

187
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,060
but you are a bad person.

188
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,400
Now, you want to hear the specials?

189
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,830
So, you can never take it off?

190
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,500
No.

191
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,800
Not even to sleep?

192
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,230
No.

193
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,260
So, you're just an idiot?

194
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,460
It's called proving a point.

195
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,500
Is the point you're an idiot?

196
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,260
Gentlemen, please.

197
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,200
Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes.

198
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,230
He can't walk in my actual shoes.

199
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,360
He has the feet of a toddler.

200
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,160
So, how are you gonna return the DVD

201
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,500
if the store went out of business?

202
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,600
Monday morning I'll go downtown

203
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,830
look up the owner's information.

204
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,530
And send him the DVD.

205
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,030
Pay the late fee.

206
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,930
And prove to Sheldon

207
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,060
that you can have a problem and solve it...

208
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,600
without acting like a complete lunatic.

209
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,000
Ah!

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,660
And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone

211
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,730
to know that "Only you can prevent forest fires."

212
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,760
I don't get it.

213
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,600
You didn't have Smokey the Bear in India?

214
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,830
No. Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose?

215
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,260
He taught us not to play with cobras.

216
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,930
You had to be taught not to play with cobras?

217
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,230
You had to be taught

218
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,260
not to burn down the forest?

219
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,160
Hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn't you order

220
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,530
something at the restaurant?

221
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,460
We did, you never brought it.

222
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,200
Oh, that's right.

223
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,230
Nachos and a turkey club.

224
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,830
Not even close.

225
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,700
Well, I was too busy standing up

226
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,330
for my friend to worry about your...

227
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,500
I want to say

228
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,730
salmon.

229
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,300
You want to say sorry.

230
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,860
So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?

231
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,500
What do you mean "how"? What's the big deal?

232
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,560
You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.

233
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,760
Then you made her cry and leave.

234
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,700
Okay, you guys are overreacting.

235
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,200
Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back.

236
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,660
What is wrong with you, Penny?!

237
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,360
You ruined any chance I had

238
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,000
of getting back with Lucy!

239
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,160
Now she knows I'm a desperate mess

240
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,460
instead of just being pretty sure!

241
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,300
It's Lucy.

242
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,130
She wants to meet for coffee.

243
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,200
I love you, Penny!

244
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,200
Hey, what're you working on?

245
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,360
I'm thinking about

246
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,200
how one could use the fact

247
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,060
that a rapidly rotating mirror

248
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,260
turns virtual photons into real ones

249
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,230
as a method of observing dark energy.

250
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,960
That's a pretty cool idea.

251
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah. It's great you're here.

252
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,530
I'd love to get an engineer's opinion.

253
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,800
Sure.

254
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,160
This chair is squeaky.

255
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,100
Now, do I fix it or get a new one?

256
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,060
Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning,

257
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,530
but I found the owner of the video store.

258
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,260
And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep,

259
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,260
drunk at the bottom of a pool.

260
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,700
Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to,

261
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,400
so this issue is resolved.

262
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,560
Ah...

263
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,500
And I'd just like to point out that

264
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,030
even though the sweater was uncomfortable,

265
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,560
I didn't use it as an excuse

266
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,100
to antagonize everyone around me.

267
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,960
You know, you could reimburse

268
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,560
the video store owner's next of kin.

269
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,060
Or it's resolved!

270
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,630
Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good.

271
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,310
This is yours.

272
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,000
Can I ask you guys a question?

273
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So, I'm seeing Lucy tomorrow night,

274
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,700
and I've never hung out with someone who broke up with me.

275
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,060
How do you do it?

276
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,530
You can't let her know you're hurting.

277
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,060
You know, the key is confidence.

278
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,530
Why is the key always confidence?

279
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,860
How come it's never love handles and flop sweat?

280
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,500
If this girl hurt you so much,

281
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,900
are you sure you want to see her again?

282
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,260
Well, if I may...

283
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,760
he has so little self-respect

284
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,900
and is so desperate

285
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,400
for the smallest crumb of affection,

286
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,230
she could literally sleep with his own father

287
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,360
in his own bed and post the video to YouTube,

288
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,630
and he'd still buy her flowers

289
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,630
and ask her to be his bride.

290
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,930
He's right.

291
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,600
But in my defense, if we could survive that,

292
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,530
we could survive anything.

293
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,730
Well, if you're sure you want to do this,

294
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,730
it's only coffee...

295
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,800
just relax and see what happens.

296
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,860
Well, can I say she looks nice?

297
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,700
Sure.

298
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,330
Can I tell her I miss her?

299
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,330
Maybe, if she asks.

300
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,130
Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made

301
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,830
of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?

302
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,730
I'd save that for the second date.

303
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,130
Good, good.

304
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,800
'Cause no matter how hard I try,

305
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,300
I cannot get the twins to look alike.

306
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,930
What are you doing?

307
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,660
Oh, I'm just trying to find the stupid next of kin

308
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,730
to this stupid video store owner

309
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,500
so I can return the DVD

310
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,130
and see the look on Sheldon's stupid face

311
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,060
when he sees that I didn't let this get to me.

312
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,760
Sheldon's not here.

313
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,060
Why don't you take the sweater off?

314
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,830
Th-Th-There's a principle at stake!

315
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,200
- Which is?  - Oh, I don't know.

316
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,500
Who cares? Look at me!

317
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,030
Oh, my God!

318
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,660
Is that sweater made of bees?

319
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,800
Come on, take it off. I won't tell.

320
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,060
No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins.

321
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,400
Sweetie...

322
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,260
every night you don't kill him in his sleep,

323
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,060
he wins.

324
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,360
Nah, i-it's... it's almost done.

325
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,900
I just, I have to find...

326
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,060
the next of kin, and send 'em the DVD

327
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,160
and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die

328
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,060
so I can get a skin graft.

329
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,460
Smile.

330
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,700
What-what is that?

331
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,700
What is that for?

332
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,200
So you can send it to Princeton

333
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,860
and get your money back.

334
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,400
I must say, Sheldon,

335
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,100
you're handling this DVD business

336
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,800
with an impressive amount of maturity.

337
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,230
I don't know why that surprises you.

338
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,330
I'm a grown man.

339
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,700
As should be evident by this sport coat

340
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,400
and very real flower in my lapel.

341
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,600
Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you're employing?

342
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,900
The more interesting question you should be asking is:

343
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,730
"What does this flower smell like?"

344
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,630
I'm gonna go with sad.

345
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,160
So what's the story

346
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,600
with you and this DVD?

347
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,130
There's nothing to tell.

348
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,230
Maybe I purchased a book entitled,

349
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,730
Don't Sweat the Small Stuff

350
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,460
and I followed its wise suggestions,

351
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,730
one of which was:

352
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,800
stop and smell the flowers.

353
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,700
Seriously?

354
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,730
Please.

355
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,160
Ha-ha!

356
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,960
Oh.

357
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,400
- Hi.  - Hello.

358
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,330
Oh, it's so good to see you.

359
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,500
You, too.

360
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Please, sit.

361
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,130
I, uh, I got you a cappuccino.

362
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,430
I remembered it was your favorite.

363
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,160
Oh. I also got crumb cake,

364
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,530
but I remembered it was my favorite and I ate it.

365
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,530
Anyway, uh, how are you?

366
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,360
I'm pretty good.

367
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,900
Listen, I just wanted to apologize

368
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,160
for breaking up with you in an e-mail.

369
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,330
Well, and I ate all the crumb cake.

370
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,100
We both made mistakes.

371
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,060
Okay.

372
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,100
I'm so happy you asked me here,

373
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,930
and I hope we can hang out again sometime.

374
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,360
You know, as friends,

375
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,200
lovemaking partners, whatever.

376
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,500
Oh, uh...

377
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,730
I'm kind of seeing someone.

378
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,400
I think I know the answer to this,

379
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,800
but just to be clear, it's not me, right?

380
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,360
This is all your fault!

381
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,960
I should've listened to Mun-Mun

382
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,430
because I've been playing with a cobra

383
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,130
and her name is Penny!

384
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,000
Why are you so cruel?

385
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,760
Do you enjoy my pain?

386
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,830
There's a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.

387
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,900
I love you, Penny!

388
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,030
How is it I can conceptualize a methodology

389
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,560
of examining dark matter in the universe

390
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,900
but can't figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?

391
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,000
I think the real question is,

392
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,330
why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?

393
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,630
There's probably a deep reason.

394
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,930
Which I'd be happy to discuss with you

395
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,000
over some peanut brittle in a can.

396
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,900
Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options!

397
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,860
Video store owner, Nursis Manookian,

398
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,500
has no next of kin!

399
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,460
Well, you seem hot under the collar...

400
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,560
or is that the sweater?

401
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,100
Oh, oh, no, no.

402
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,130
It... It's because I spent all afternoon

403
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,460
at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held.

404
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,430
According to Father Solakian,

405
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,900
no one attended.

406
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,900
Luckily, my trip wasn't a complete waste.

407
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,560
I lit a candle and prayed for your death.

408
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,960
But I'm not Armenian, so it probably won't work!

409
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,930
This is over, right?

410
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,860
Oh, not necessarily.

411
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,560
I suggest

412
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
you look for long-lost relatives

413
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,800
either in Armenia or Lebanon.

414
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,460
Listen to me, Sheldon.

415
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,630
I am not going to Lebanon

416
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,330
to return Super Mario Bros. the movie!

417
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,000
You know, it might be fun.

418
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,460
You love hummus.

419
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,030
Why isn't this bothering you?

420
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,400
It... Isn't your brain getting itchy?

421
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,800
This is on your card.

422
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,200
This could be ruining your credit score!

423
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,730
Why isn't this making you crazy?

424
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,730
Leonard...

425
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,030
I have something to tell you,

426
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,000
but I want you to promise not to flip out.

427
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,400
What?

428
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,700
Seven years ago,

429
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,660
I found out the DVD was late

430
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,860
and I paid for it.

431
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,960
What?

432
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,860
I was going to mention it at the time,

433
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,060
but then I thought, some day,

434
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,030
this might be a teachable moment.

435
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,230
Hah...

436
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,800
I... you...

437
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,200
How can...

438
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,260
What?!

439
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,260
Sheldon...

440
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,860
that was diabolical.

441
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,060
I know.

442
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,030
And it wasn't easy.

443
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,630
Do you have any idea what it's like

444
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,000
to wait for years and never know

445
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,570
who would finally get satisfaction?

446
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,900
Wow.

447
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,730
You're even prettier than Penny said.

448
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,000
I can't believe

449
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
a girl like you doesn't have a boyfriend.

450
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,930
Well, I don't.

451
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,860
I don't believe you, you're lying to me!

452
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,060
What?

453
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,400
Oh, it's okay.

454
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,100
I have no morals and I'm desperately lonely.

455
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,360
I'll be the other man

456
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,130
if you want a little something-something on the side.

457
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,960
What is wrong with you?!

458
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,630
What is wrong with you?!

459
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,460
What is wrong with you?!

460
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,460
