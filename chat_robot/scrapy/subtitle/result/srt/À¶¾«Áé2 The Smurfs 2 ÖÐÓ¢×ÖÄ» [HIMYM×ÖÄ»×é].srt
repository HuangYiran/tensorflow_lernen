我来瞧瞧
Let's see.

27
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,220
你在这啊
There you are.

没错 来点虎皮百合
Yes, tiger lily

30
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,650
将魔法与蓝色赋予她的精华

31
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,320
如果这个咒语真的能起作用的话
Unless this spell be all for naught,

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,320
最后一步 一个美好的愿望
the final thing, one hopeful thought.

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,420
很久很久以前 在蓝精灵村
Once upon a time, in Smurf Village,

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,420
欢乐的蓝精灵们过着幸福的生活
happy Smurfs were going about their happy lives

35
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,590
全然不知就在村子的不远处
completely unaware that not too far away,

36
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,760
有一个坏巫师格格巫
the evil wizard Gargamel

37
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,520
正在酝酿一个邪恶的计划
was concocting a diabolical plan.

38
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,520
嘿
Hey.

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,940
嘿
Hey!

40
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,980
滑滑 你抢了旁白念念的戏
Smooth, you're upstaging the narrator.

41
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,280
哟 音量下调一格好了 蓝兄弟们
Yo, take it down a notch, my blues brothers.

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,360
-好吧 好的  -谢了 紧接着...
-All right. All right. -Thank you. Anyway...

43
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,860
格格巫说道
So Gargamel said,

44
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,620
我要造一个属于自己的秘密武器
"I am making my own irresistible creation,

45
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,200
蓝妹妹
The Smurfette,

46
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,210
让她潜入村子 然后出卖所有蓝精灵
to infiltrate their village and betray the Smurfs."

47
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,810
哇哦
Wow.

48
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,310
她看起来好吓人啊
Not a good look on her.

49
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,980
\{\a6}原词Frankenstein 科学怪人

50
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,980
-她是个科学怪精灵吗  -没错
-She's a Frankensmurf? -Yes.

51
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,230
她淘气的天性搞得蓝精灵村鸡飞狗跳
And her naughty nature took Smurf Village by storm.

52
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,610
她甚至用大水淹掉了村子
She even flooded our village.

53
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,070
蓝精灵们希望她消失
The Smurfs wanted her gone,

54
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,400
但即使她是格格巫造出来的
but even though she was Gargamel's creation,

55
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,250
爸爸却看出了她善良的一面
Papa saw the good in her.

56
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,450
用爱 善良 一次改头换面
With love, kindness, a complete makeover,

57
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,500
还有一个神秘的魔法配方
and a secret magic formula,

58
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,840
爸爸把她变成了一个真正的蓝精灵
he turned her into a true-blue Smurf,

59
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,590
我们亲爱的蓝妹妹就是这样来的
and that is how our darling Smurfette came to be.

60
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,760
-嗨  -我的亲娘唉
-Hi. -Holy moly.

61
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,270
嗨 蓝妹妹
Hi, Smurfette.

62
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,600
好羡慕她的头发
I wish I had that hair.

63
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,690
-跳得漂亮 蓝妹妹  -太不可思议了
-Nice dive, Smurfette. -That was amazing.

64
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,740
哇 臭显摆
Wow. Show-off.

65
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,860
漂亮
Pretty!

66
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,280
-太美了  -漂亮的抱膝转体
-That was so purty. -Nice tuck and roll.

67
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,080
-嗨  -就像一条美人鱼
-Hi! -Like a beautiful mermaid.

68
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,910
等等 她头发怎么还是干的
Wait, how is her hair still dry?

69
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,370
噢 不
Oh, no.

70
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,000
怎么...
What...

71
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,130
愚蠢又天真的蓝精灵啊
Stupid, trusting Smurfs.

72
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,010
现在都是我的了
You're mine now.

73
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,010
-她还活着  -快到蓝精灵山去
-It's alive! -Smurf for the hills!

74
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,850
别杀旁白君啊
Don't kill the narrator!

75
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,970
我们的世界要完蛋了
The world as we know it is over!

76
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,020
她有龙之魔杖
She's got a Dragon Wand.

77
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,770
别弄坏我的纸杯蛋糕
Don't hurt my cupcake!

78
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,850
小心啊
Look out!

79
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,740
真棒 我漂亮的小家伙
Yes! My beautiful creation.

80
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,120
你真是爸爸的好女儿
You truly are daddy's little girl.

81
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,080
不...
No...

82
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,840
蓝妹妹 你还好吗
Smurfette, are you okay?

83
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,220
哦 爸爸
Oh, Papa.

84
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,430
没事 乖啦 一切都会好起来的
There, there. Everything's going to be fine.

85
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,510
又做那个噩梦了吗
Having that nightmare again?

86
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,770
爸爸 每年一到我过生日的时候
Papa, every year on my birthday,

87
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,850
我就会做相同的恶梦 梦到我是怎么来的
I have these horrible dreams about where I come from,

88
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,520
这让我怀疑自己 到底是谁
and it makes me wonder who I really am.

89
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,880
然后每年我都会提醒你
And every year, I remind you,

90
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,740
你来自哪里并不重要
it doesn't matter where you came from.

91
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,660
重要的是你想成为什么样的人 
What matters is who you choose to be.

92
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,530
真的吗
Really?

93
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,160
别太在意我这个老人家的话
Don't take this old Smurf's word for it.

94
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,710
自己去外面看看吧
Go out there and see for yourself.

95
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,130
你就是属于这里的
This is where you belong.

96
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,800
你是属于格格巫的
You belong to Gargamel.

97

你是属于格格巫的
You belong to Gargamel.

98
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,090
"你是属于格格巫的" 快说
"You belong to Gargamel." Say it.

99
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,760
"你是属于格格巫的"
"You belong to Gargamel."

100
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,140
是我

那好吧 算了 先生 你是一只傻癞蛤蟆
You know what? Never mind, sir. You're a dim-witted toad.

103
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,230
"你是一只傻癞蛤蟆吗 先生"
"You're a dim-witted toad, sir?"

104

不 实际上 你才是
No, actually, you are!

105
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,860

from the most innovative conjurer the world has ever seen.

108

114
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,350
哟 给我滚远点 怪胎
Yo, get out of the road, freak!

115
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,940
胆子真肥啊 居然敢叫我"哟"
How dare you? How dare you call me "Yo"?

116
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,110
哦 不 把我的车放下来
Hey, no, put my car down.

117
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,940
哟 在上面感觉如何啊
Yo, how do you like it up there?

118
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,410

Oh, dear gods, can we please just have one quiet carriage ride

123
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,640
你别再指责我滥用蓝精灵精华了 要被你折磨死了
without you tormenting me about using up all the Smurf essence?

124
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,290
在纽约王国的时候
I extracted all I could

125
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,060
我拼了老命提取蓝爸爸的精华
from Papa Smurf in the kingdom of New York.

126
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,890
倒说说你提取了多少啊
How much essence did you extract?

127
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
你说我滥用吗
I'm squandering it?

128
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,650
你在说什么鬼话
What are you talking about?

129
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,760
我必须把那个人变成巨型癞蛤蟆
I had to turn that man into a giant toad.

130
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,150
魔术表演就要这样 不是吗
It's a magic show, isn't it?

131
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,610
因为如果没有蓝精华 我就不能...
Because without Smurf essence, I can't...

132
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,490
我跟你讨论这个干嘛 你一点魔法都没有
Why am I even discussing this with you? You don't have any magic!

133
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,830
把这句话贴到你的Facebook主页上舔去吧

Besides,

136
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,880
我还是有足够的精华
I still have plenty enough essence

137
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,460
用来开展我那可爱的邪恶计划
left to carry out my delightfully diabolical plan.

138
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,720
现在 我亲爱的民众们在召唤我了
Now, my adoring public desires me.

139

Hello!

140
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,930
你们好 卑微的小马屁精们
Hello, my lowly little bootlicks.

141
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,180

Even you, my flea-bitten little fur bag.

144

万岁 伟大而强大的...
All hail the great and powerful...

145
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,110
阿兹猫...阿兹猫...住手

肯定是仰慕者送来的
No doubt from a worshipping admirer.

151
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,140
是给你的啊
It's for you.

152
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,810
你才不可能比我受欢迎
You are not more popular than I am.

153
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,310
一个绿色的小点
A little green dot?

154
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,690
为什么你总是收到小绿点呢
Why do you get all the little green dots?

155
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,530
抓住它 抓住它
Get it, get it.

156
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,990
爸爸一定会喜欢这个的
Father's going to love this.

157
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,070
-汉库斯想玩  -嘿

掩护我
Cover me.

160
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,870
我要上了
I'm going in.

161
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,410
你好 猫咪
Hello, kitty.

162
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,750
维可西
Vexy!

163
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,580
好了 我的小淘气精灵
All right, my little Naughties.

164
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,040
耶
Yeah!

165
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,090
汉库斯伸出援手
Hackus to the rescue!

166
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,510
噢耶
Booyah!

167
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,630
干得漂亮 汉库斯
Good save, Hackus.

168
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,840
拉 快拉
Pull, pull!

169
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,760
汉库斯捕猫 捕到一只大家伙
Hackus cat-fishing. Caught a big one.

170
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,930
第12回合 淘气精灵赢
And round 12 goes to the Naughties.

171
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,060
说得好 我的傻兄弟
Well said, my dim brother.

172
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,440
显而易见 这不是礼物 阿兹猫
Apparently, it wasn't a gift, Azrael.

173
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,940
这是个陷阱
It was a trap.

174
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,650
-真好玩 我的小淘气精灵  -嘿
-Very amusing, my little Naughties. -Hey!

175
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,900
我们让你开心了吗 爸爸
Did we please you, Father?

176
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,990
不 不 你没有
No, no, you didn't.

177
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,910
你知道什么会让我开心吗
You know what would please me,

178
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,870
维可西 如果你像真正的蓝精灵一样也是蓝色的
Vexy, if you were blue like real Smurfs,

179
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,260
那么你们的精华就能赋予我真实的魔力
then your essence would endow

180
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,370
就像一个真正的蓝精灵那样
me with real magic like that of a true-blue Smurf.

181
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,380
那样我才兴奋呢
That would excite me.

182
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,250
相反 你们俩都只是让人失望透顶的试验品罢了
Instead, you're both just deeply disappointing experiments.

183
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,550
试验品吗
Experiment?

184
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,630
就跟我那叛徒蓝妹妹一样
Like my traitor Smurfette.

185
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,360
横幅要挂那边去 谢谢啦
The banner goes over there, please.

186
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,850
非常感谢 还有那个大丽花真不错
Thank you, and I love the pinnata.

187
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,220
-这样如何 勇勇  -再低一点点 厌厌
-How's that, Gutsy?  -A little lower, Grouchy.

188
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,980
我想要一棍子把他打进蓝精灵浆果堆
I want to be able to whack him right in the smurf berries.

189
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,980
嗨 厌厌 嗨 勇勇
Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy.

What a cake! Smurfette's gonna love this party!

191
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,940
喂 哪个蓝家伙在蓝妹妹的生日蛋糕上啃了一口啊
Hey, who smurfed a bite out of Smurfette's birthday cake?

192
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,030
-不是我  -真的吗  -我不知道
-Not me. -Realy. -I don't know.

193
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,150
-贪贪  -怎么 你们为什么都盯着我看
-Greedy? -What? Why you all looking at me?

194
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,410
嗨 聪聪 这是我为蓝妹妹惊喜派对准备的礼物
Hey, Brainy, here's my present for Smurfette's surprise party.

195
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,470
来吧 乐乐 你真的认为我
Come on, Jokey, do you really think that I,

196
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,030
作为全村最聪明的蓝精灵
the smartest Smurf in the village,

197
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,000
-会被你这种半吊子智商的人糊弄住吗  -没错
-would fall for your sophomoric gag? -Yep.

198
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,830
把卡片给我拿过来
Just give me the card.

199
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,080
竟然被一个傻精灵耍了
Out-smurfed by a simpleton.

200
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,610
-她来啦  -蓝妹妹来啦
-She's coming. -Smurfette's coming.

201
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,170
-噢 不 被她看到了惊喜就毁了
-Oh, no! The surprise will be ruined.

202
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,260
蓝色警报 蓝色警报 重复一遍 这不是演习 蓝色警报
Code blue! Code blue! Repeat, this is not a drill. Code blue.

203
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,430
快还原啊 取掉胶水
Undo it, unglue it!

204
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,840
我们要把她引到别的地方去
We gotta get her out of here!

205
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,050
她来了 大家自然点
Here she is! Act natural!

嗨 靓靓

Want to sit by the fountain and look at your reflection?

210
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,650
我看自己都快看烦了 蓝妹妹
Kind of tired of looking at myself, Smurfette.

211
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,940
才怪呢
As if.

212
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,940
停下来 所有人现在全都停手
Nope, not building anything for anybody.

213
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,030
-你好 策划精灵  -你好

Anything fun coming up that I should know about?

216
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,450
没有 蓝精灵狂欢节之前没什么好期待的了
No, nothing till Smurf A palooza.

217
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,870
到时候可以好好疯玩一下 对吧 公关精灵
It's going to be wild, right, Social Smurf?

218
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,540

Yeah. I've got it all over the Smurf Web.

所以 没人记得我的生日吗
So, no one remembered my birthday?

222
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,380
惊喜要被毁掉了啊
The surprise is gonna be ruined!

223

你知道吗 蓝妹妹 有时候呢
You know, Smurfette, occasionally,

225
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,310
独处一下也是件不错的事情呢
it's good to have a little alone time.

226
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,000
-对的 去远足下什么的  -对啊

We fooled her pretty good, don't you think, Clumsy Smurf?

231
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:00,160
当然 她完全没发现这个惊喜派对
Yeah! She's got no idea about the surprise party!

232
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,580

Dude.

233

00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,930
注意距离 求你了 有点底线啊
Boundaries, please. Boundaries.

278
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:52,980
咱给他们表演一个
Let's show them how it's done.

279
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,600
放开我
Unhand me.

280
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,270
我 一 点 都 不 喜 欢 这 样 啊
I don't like this at all.

281
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,980
谢谢你
Thank you.

282
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,820
道尔家男人们的拥抱 无与伦比啊
There's nothing like the embrace of two proud Doyle men.

283
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,200
我不姓道尔
I am not a Doyle man.

284
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
我的小帕蒂•道尔
Little Paddy Doyle.

285
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,820
-是温斯洛  -好吧 我妥协了 温斯洛
-Winslow. -Okay, compromise. Winslow.

286
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,700
温斯洛-道尔
Winslow-Doyle.

287
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,540
嘿 他是不是那个玉米热狗电视广告里面的家伙
Hey, isn't he the guy from the Corndog commercials on TV?

288
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,710
-嘿 没错  -好吧 被你们发现了
-Hey, you're right. -Well, you got me.

289
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,130
-玉米热狗之王  -不 不 不
-Korndog King. - No, no, no.

290
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,170
-等一下  -千万不要啊
-One moment. - Please not this.

291
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,710
现在 为了庆祝蓝蓝的生日
Now, in honour of Blue's birthday,

292
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,840
我要给大家每个人
I'm going to present each

293
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,420
一个免费玉米热狗
and every one of you with a free Korndog...

294
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,050
-谢谢你  -我请客

296
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,510
这是给你的
That's for you.

297
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,350
这里面有花生吗
Do these have any peanuts?

298
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,020
我的玉米热狗里面从没放过花生
I would never put peanuts in a Korndog.

299
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,190
太好了
Great.

300
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,690
吃吧 大个子 可以吃
Go ahead, big guy, it's okay.

301
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,690
非常简单 想想看 我们用花生油把它炸的透透的
For the simple reason, you see, we deep-fry them in peanut oil.

302
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,820
花生油吗
Peanut oil?

303
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,610
-什么  -约翰尼 吐出来 马上吐出来
-What? -Johnny, spit it... Spit it out right away!

304
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,240
好的 我来打急救电话 别急
Okay, I got the phone, okay.

305
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,740
吐出来 约翰尼 马上吐出来 吐到妈妈手上来
Spit it out, Johnny! Spit it out right away! Into Mama's hands.

306
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,910
深呼吸 来一针肾上腺素
Deep breath for the EpiPen.

307
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,240
-会没事的  -这孩子的嘴唇是怎么了
-It's okay. -What's happening to that kid's lips?

308
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,040
-阿兹猫 把我的计划书拿过来  -爸爸
-Azrael, bring me my plan. - Father?

309
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,170
就在浴室里 看看在不在洗手盆旁边
It's in the bathroom. Check my side of the sink.

310
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,250
爸爸
Father?

311
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,960
该喂我们了
It's feeding time.

312
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,840
汉库斯晕乎乎
Hackus dizzy.

313
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,010
对的 我差点忘了
Yes, I almost forgot.

314
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,430
很显然 我还要养活你们俩个
Apparently, I have to keep you alive.

315
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,200
我希望你们懂得感恩
I hope you both appreciate

316
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,850
你们对于我来说是多么沉重的负担啊
what a tremendous burden this is upon me.

317
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,140
好吧 要有礼貌
All right, mind your manners.

318
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,560
非常感谢
Thank you.

319
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,860
如果你们是真的蓝精灵 我就可以从你们身上提取精华了
If you were real Smurfs, I'd be taking essence from you.

320
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,530
我没听见你说"谢谢"
I didn't hear a "Thank you."

321
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,320
勉强算是吧 来 快过来
Close enough. Come, come.

322
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,620
今晚突袭蓝精灵村之前我们还得再过一遍计划
We must review my plan before tonight's raid on Smurf Village.

323
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,750
这才不是我的手稿 我的计划书呢
This is not my writing parchment. Where is my plan?

324
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,750
"变成了电子版"
"Gone digital"?

325
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,960
我听不懂你说的啥意思
I don't understand what that means.

326
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,460
好吧 第一步 "制造淘气精灵" 没错
Yes, phase one, "Create Naughties." Yes.

327
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,630
完成 第二步在哪里
Check. Where is phase two?

328
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,630
啊 建造通往蓝精灵村的传送门
ah create portal to smurf village

329
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,970
这滑来滑去好像很爽啊
I am enamoured of that swiping motion.

330
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,720
对的 走开 走开 走开 走开
Yes, get away, get away, get away, get away.

331
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,770
第三步 划一划
Phase three... Swipe.

332
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,730
抓住我那没良心的女儿
I capture my ungrateful daughter

333
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,380
逼她告诉我
and force her to tell me the

334
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,030
蓝爸爸把她变蓝的神秘配方
secret formula that Papa used to turn her blue.

335
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,190
再划
Swipe.

336
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,400
把你们变蓝 再造上几百个你们这样的全都给变蓝
I turn you and hundreds other like you blue.

337
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,490
汉库斯变蓝啦
Hackus blue!

338
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,490
汉库斯变蓝啦
Hackus blue!

339
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,410
然后把你们放进一个可怕的机器里 吸出你们的精华
I place you into a terrifying machine and extract your essence.

340
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,540
-什么  -再然后
-What? -And then,

341
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,620
我就能统领全世界啦
the entire world shall bow before me!

342
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,630
吸精华的那个 会疼吗
Will that extracting thing hurt?

343
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,300
那可是极其折磨的... 不疼 
It's excruciating...ly painless.

344
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,510
到时候你就知道了 好玩着呢 对我来说
You'll see, it'll be fun, for me.

345
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,590
好啦 反正咱还没到那一步
Anyway, we're getting ahead of ourselves.

346
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,580
回到第二步 我们千里迢迢
Back to phase two, the very

347
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,100
跑到这个一股臭奶酪味的城市来 就是为了它
reason we came to this cheese-infested metropolis.

348
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,600
大铁塔的尖
The great iron spire.

349
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,270
只有用这个办法
The only possible way

350
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,240
才能聚集足够的能量
to harness enough energy to create

351
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,860
建造一个通往蓝精灵村中心的传送门
a portal right into the heart of Smurf Village.

352
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,610
传送门发明 我的最爱
How I love portal creation.

353
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,780
动起来 快 到铁塔尖上去
Come, come, let us away! To the iron spire!

354
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,950
成功啦
It worked!

355
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,580
太好了 精华正好够用
Yes! Just enough essence!

356
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,670
创造历史的时刻来啦
And now I will go down in history!

357
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,630
没有什么能阻挡我啦
Nothing can stop me now!

358
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,430
我的格格蛋啊
My Gargaberries!

359
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,810
啊 不
Oh, no!

360
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,150
现在就来证明 我是个天才
Now I shall prove my genius!

361
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,240
转转头
Head spin!

362
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,290
看来我的精华还不够
It appears I lack sufficient

363
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,290
造出的传送门太小 人过不去啊
essence to create a human-size portal.

364
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,590
爸爸 我能钻过这个洞 让我去抓蓝妹妹吧
Father, I can fit through there. Let me get Smurfette.

365
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,710
让汉库斯去 汉库斯想去
Hackus go! Hackus go!

366
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,210
-嘿  -让汉库斯去
-Hey! -Hackus go!

367
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,260
都想去是吧 那就
Yes, yes. Well, let's see here.

368
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,050
-挑兵挑将...  -选我 选我
-Eeny, meeny, miny... -Pick me! Pick me!

369
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,180
打仗
Moron.

370
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,220
耶
Yes!

371
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,350
-嘿 汉库斯 我有话跟你说  -什么
-Hey, Hackus, listen to this. -What?

372
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,640
我赢了
I win.

373
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,390
这招漂亮 维可西
Nicely played, Vexy

374
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,060
好了 我警告你啊
Now, I must warn you.

375
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,730
你要去的地方恐怖至极
Your destination is a true horror.

376
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,320
那里空气中充满了让人窒息的和平与安静
A realm filled with the relentless crushing quiet of peace,

377
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,620
偶尔还有刺耳的欢快声音穿插在里面
punctuated by the wretched cacophony of joyousness.

378
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,450
-太可怕了  -简直就是噩梦
-It's horrible. -What a nightmare.

379
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,910
对 对啊 那里彻底毁掉了你姐姐
Yes, yes, it completely ruined your sister.

380
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,290
坏姑娘变好真是太丢人了
It's such a shame when a bad girl turns good.

381
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,370
说得好
So true.

382
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,000
但是她知道那个秘方
But she does know the secret formula,

383
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,340
去把蓝妹妹抓来
so go get Smurfette!

384
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,100
我真是想不通
I just don't get it.

385
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,310
他们明知道生日这一天对我来说有多不好过
They know how tough my birthday can be,

386
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,270
可他们就压根没记起来
and they didn't even remember.

387
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,190
也许爸爸错了
Maybe Papa was wrong.

388
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,190
也许我永远也没办法真正融入他们
Guess I'll never really be one of them.

389
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,700
-噢 不  -救命
-Oh, no! -Help.

390
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,450
求你了 别走
Please, wait.

391
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,040
我逃了出来
I escaped.

392
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,370
逃出来
Escaped?

393
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,920
从那个创造了我的坏巫师手里
From the evil wizard who made me.

394
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,130
你是说格格巫吗
Do you mean Gargamel?

395
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,800
格格巫是你爸爸吗
Is Gargamel your father?

396
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,340
是
Yes.

397
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,050
但是他...
But he's...

398
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,930
也就是说你跟我是一样的
That means you're just like me.

399
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,180
-抓到你啦  -你要干什么
-Gotcha! -What are you doing?

400
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,230
爸爸会很开心的
Father's going to be very happy.

401
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,980
蓝妹妹出事了
Smurfette's in trouble!

402
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,190
-不好啦  -噢 不
-Crikey! -Oh, no!

403
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,310
-快 蓝精灵们  -蓝妹妹
-Come on, Smurfs! -Smurfette!

404
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,980
不
No!

405
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,820
-哦 别想跑  -不
-Oh, no, you don't. -No!

406
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,400
-放手  -进去吧你
-Let go! -Now get in there!

407
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,030
哦 不
Oh, no!

408
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,240
-她被绑架了  -放开她
-She's being smurf-napped. -Unhand her!

409
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,040
再见了 蓝精灵们
So long, Smurfs.

410
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,160
-蓝妹妹  -蓝妹妹
-Smurfette! -Smurfette!

411
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,370
现在可怎么办
What are we gonna do now?

412
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,200
根据我的演绎法推断
My powers of deduction lead

413
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,290
这一定是格格巫干的好事
me to believe that this is the work of Gargamel.

414
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,430
啊 啊 啊 不
Oh, no, oh, no!

415
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,100
-成啦  -好漂亮的蓝色
-Yes! -Pretty blue.

416
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,510
格格巫
Gargamel.

417
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,730
蓝妹妹 欢迎回家
Smurfette. Welcome home.

418
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,530
你这是在浪费时间 格格巫
You're wasting your time, Gargamel.

419
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,320
爸爸他们会来救我的
Papa and the others are gonna come for me.

420
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,240
我可不觉得
I don't think so.

421
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,870
他们之前都去救笨笨了
They came for Clumsy.

422
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,620
是啊 但是你想想 笨笨是个货真价实的蓝精灵
Yes, but you see, Clumsy was a real Smurf.

423
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,920
你呢 却是我创造出来的
Whereas I was the one who created you.

424
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,550
还记得吧 啊 亲爱的
You do remember that, don't you, dear?

425
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,470
你不是我爸爸 放我回家
You're not my father. Just let me go home.

426
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,890
当然可以
Of course.

427
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,260
你想干什么都行
Anything you say,

428
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,720
但首先呢 我需要一个小小的
but first, I will need one itsy-bitsy,

429
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,390
微不足道毫不起眼的小东西
teeny-tiny little thing first.

430
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,520
-很小很小哦  -什么
-Teeny-tiny. -What?

431
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,980
就是蓝爸爸把你变成
Just the secret formula

432
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,570
一个真正蓝精灵的秘方
that Papa used to turn you into a real Smurf.

433
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,400
汉库斯要做蓝精灵 汉库斯变蓝
Hackus real Smurf. Hackus blue!

434
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,700
像你那样 金发妹
Like you, blondie.

435
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,240
这对咱俩都有好处 你说是吧 亲爱的
It would benefit us both, don't you see, my dear?

436
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,540
你给我配方 我把我的淘气精灵变蓝
You give me the formula, I turn my little Naughties blue.

437
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,410
-变蓝哟  -我取他们的精华
-Blue. -I use their essence

438
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,620
继续在这做我的魔术表演
to continue with my wonderful magic show here.

439
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,250
这样我就再也不用打扰你和蓝精灵村庄啦
That way I never have to bother you or Smurf Village again.

440
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,340
我不相信你 我什么都不会告诉你的
I don't trust you, and I'm not telling you anything.

441
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:06,010
是吗 看来需要好好劝劝你啊 哈
Well, perhaps you need a little persuasion, eh?

442
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,350
淘气精灵 上
Naughties, attack!

443
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,390
乐意效劳
With pleasure.

444
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,520
攻击
Attack!

445
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,560
-不不不 不是互相打  -打错人啦
-No, no, no, not each other. -Not me!

446
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,600
抓到你了...
I got you...

447
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,940
汉库斯
Hackus!

448
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,650
小猫 小猫 小猫
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

449
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,740
不是打猫 不是... 
Not the cat, not the...

450
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,740
这些实验品真让人失望 失望透顶
Deeply, deeply disappointing experiments.

451
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,490
我们得去把蓝妹妹救出来
We've got to rescue Smurfette.

452
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,080
怎么把她带回来
What's our plan to bring Smurfette home?

453
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,620
好的 蓝精灵们 听好了
All right, Smurfs, listen up.

454
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,370
上次蓝月亮满月的时候 
I saved enough grotto water

455
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,460
我留了足够的洞穴之水 就是为了以防万一
from the last blue moon for just such an occasion.

456
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,880
我用魔法把它们灌进了蓝精灵传输水晶里
I was able to smurf it into smurfportation crystals.

457
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,050
也就是说你不需要传送门了 爸爸你真聪明
So you don't need a portal. Very clever, Papa.

458
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,420
必了个须的
Smurf-xactly.

459
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,510
这些水晶能直接把我们传送到到温斯洛先生的蘑菇房里
These will take us directly to Master Winslow's mushroom.

460
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,940
对啊 帕特里克和格蕾丝上次
Yeah, Patrick and Grace helped

461
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,850
也帮我们通过了传送门
us last time we smurfed through the portal.

462
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,810
说的对 他们肯定知道怎么做
Precisely! They'll know what to do!

463
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,930
-我要去  -我报名
-Sign me up! -Sign me up.

464
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,980
-为您效劳 爸爸  -选我
-At your service, Papa. -Pick me!

465
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,640
-有人说过"面包师该去"吧  -我还是不去了
-Did someone say, "Baker should go"? -I would rather not.

466
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,730
我 我 选我 爸爸
Me, me, pick me, Papa!

467
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:00,190
别着急 蓝精灵们 我的水只够做九块水晶
Now, now, Smurfs. I only had water enough for nine crystals.

468
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,640
只够我和另外三个人的来回
That's me and three others round trip,

469
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,570
再加上蓝妹妹的回程
plus Smurfette on the way home.

470
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,700
那你也得先找到她 你又找不到
Assuming you can find her, which you won't.

471
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,410
你的态度太不像蓝精灵了 厌厌
That's not a very smurfy attitude, Grouchy.

472
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,580
其实对我来说 这已经算不错的了
Actually, for me, that was pretty good.

473
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,750
我需要勇气 智慧和力量
I'll need courage, intelligence and strength.

474
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,120
-勇勇  -好叻
-So Gutsy. -Aye.

475
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,330
-聪聪  -当然了
-Brainy. -Of course.

476
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,540
-健健  -你放心吧
-Hefty. -You got it.

477
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,500
-你们三个跟我走  -那个 我能...
-You'll smurf with me. -Yeah, can I...

478
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,840
怎么了 蓝郁郁
Yes, Passive-Aggressive Smurf?

479
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,760
我带上聪聪真是个好主意
I think Brainy is a really excellent choice.

480
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
祝你们好运啊
Good luck with that.

481
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,220
你看看他在干什么
You see what he does?

482
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,180
-那可不是在表扬我  -自己猜吧
-That's not a compliment. -Go figure.

483
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,600
-好了 健健 拿一颗  -我们行动吧
-Okay, Hefty, take one. -Let's do this.

484
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,770
-快去救她  -啊呀
-go get her, guys! -Oops!

485
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,850
笨笨
Clumsy.

486
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,190
谁想想办法啊
Somebody do something!

487
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,520
让开 我会蓝精灵抢救术
Stand back! I know the Smurflich manoeuver.

488
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,860
他看起来不妙啊
He doesn't look good.

489
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,860
哦 天 他变得更蓝了
Oh, dear, he's turning blue-er.

490
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,950
不好了
Not good.

491
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,910
谁去拿我的锤子来
Somebody get my hammer!

492
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,870
看你干的好事 笨笨
Nice going, Clumsy.

493
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,240
放着我来
I got it!

494
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,870
好呀
Cheerio!

495
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,210
本来应该是健健的
This was supposed to be Hefty!

496
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,710
对不起啊 爸爸
Sorry! My bad!

497
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,340
我一出门就容易浮肿的
I get so puffy when I travel.

498
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,420
拜
Bye.

499
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,260
呃 有时候 计划赶不上变化啊
Well, sometimes, you got to smurf with the changes.

500
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,430
一路顺风 爸爸
Travel safe, Papa.

501
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,220
就这样爸爸带着他的候补小队
And so Papa and his B team...

502
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,760
你不在的时候村子就交给我了
I'll be in charge while you're gone!

503
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,060
-就这样爸爸  -把蓝妹妹救回来
-And so Papa... -Go get Smurfette back!

504
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,890
-让我说完啊  -把她带回家
-Come on! -And bring her home!

505
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,980
他的喉咙通畅了 嘴唇也恢复了原样 太好了
I'm glad his throat opened up and his lips are back to normal.

506
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,820
我们真的很抱歉
Again, we're so sorry.

507
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,990
如果... 喂
If... Hello?

508
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,030
强尼又可以呼吸了
Johnny can breathe again, which

509
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,870
我也总算松了口气 因为他父母都是律师
makes two of us since both of his parents are lawyers.

510
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,830
呃 怪不得他们反应那么过激
Well, that's why they overreacted.

511
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,120
他们没有反应过激
They didn't overreact.

512
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,960
他快死了
He's dying.

513
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,130
我觉得你该戴上这个了
I think it's time for this.

514
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,420
别告诉我你把皇冠带来了吧 别给他戴皇冠
You didn't bring the crown. Don't put the crown on him.

515
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,010
别这样 你以前很喜欢这个皇冠的
Come on, you used to love this crown.

516
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,470
-我才没有呢  -真的 你特别喜欢
-No, I didn't. -Yes, you did.

517
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,220
-你走哪都戴着它  -我没有
-You wore it everywhere. -I did not.

518
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,390
从来没有 一次也没有
Never did. Never once.

519
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,600
这样做才对...看着
This is the way you do it... Look.

520
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,980
你看到外面在干嘛了吗
Do you see what is going on out there?

521
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,810
嗯 他们在增进感情呢
Yeah, they're bonding.

522
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,110
-严格来说 他们是在吐口水  -别这样嘛
-Technically, they're spitting. -Come on.

523
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,610
蓝蓝应该知道他的家人不止是你和我而已
Blue needs to know that family's not just you and me,

524
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,610
他跟爷爷一起玩玩多好的啊
and it's really good for him to play with his grandfather.

525
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,200
干的漂亮
Good job!

526
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,990
-嗯 就是 他可真是个好榜样  -别这样 帕特里克
-Oh, yeah. He's a terrific role model. -Come on, Patrick.

527
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,540
格蕾丝 他什么东西都能毁
Grace, he ruins everything.

528
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,290
到处走 到处毁 他就是这样的人
He shows up, and he ruins things. That's what he does.

529
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,630
就像他刚刚搬进我家的时候
Just like when he first moved into my house.

530
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,920
他把我的鹦鹉送走了
He sent my parrot away.

531
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
你有鹦鹉
Your parrot?

532
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,170
是我爸爸的鹦鹉
My father's parrot.

533
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:35,930
我爸爸离开的时候 他留下了宙斯 我好喜欢那只鸟
When my dad took off, he left Zeus, and I loved that bird.

534
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,850
那时候我还小 宙斯是我爸爸唯一留下的东西
I was a kid, and Zeus was the only part of my dad I had left.

535
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,070
这就对了
There you go.

536
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,490
什么东西
What?

537
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,120
保护蓝蓝 蓝蓝
Get Blue. Blue?

538
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,790
蓝蓝
Blue?

539
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,250
蓝蓝 维克多
Blue! Victor!

540
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,180
-呆着别动  -维克多 蓝蓝在你那吗
-Stay there. -Victor, do you have Blue?

541
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,560
维克多 我们打不开门啊
Victor! We can't get the door open!

542
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,020
维克多
Victor!

543
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,600
-维克多 开门啊  -维克多 我们打不开门啊
-Victor, open the door! -Victor, we can't open the door!

544
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,610
我看不见 我看不见
I can't see! I can't see!

545
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,490
我在一个黑漆漆的没有生命的星球上 闻起来一股玉米热狗味
I'm on a dark, lifeless planet that smells like corn dogs!

546
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,540
噢 我晕了
Oh, the smurfanity.

547
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,290
对不起 先生 你的脸挡着路了
Sorry, mister. Your face got in the way.

548
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,960
-那是笨笨吗 蓝精灵们来了  -笨笨
-Is that Clumsy? Smurfs? -Clumsy?

549
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,720
-救命啊  -小心啊厌厌

550
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,430
-笨笨 是你吗  -这边
-Clumsy, is that you? -This way!

551
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,970
-我瞎了  -不是 你困在玉米狗里了
-I'm blind! -No, you're in a corn dog.

552
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,260
我就知道没什么好结果
I knew it would end this way!

553
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,600
我在哪
Where am I?

554
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,650
这地方好奇怪 好吓人
This place is strange and terrifying

555
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:10,150
还很帅

556
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,980

-Everyone ok? -No!

558
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,490
我们在黑暗中迷路了 周围还有一股玉米热狗味
We're lost in the dark, and it smells like corn dogs!

559
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,660
小心
Watch out!

560
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,450
温斯洛先生变老了啊
Master Winslow's gotten old.

561
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,250
-等等 等等  -蓝蓝

-朋友  -对
-Friends? -Yeah.

564
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,670
他们这些蓝色小外星人 想要偷走我们的脸
They're little blue aliens trying to steal our faces.

565
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,460
不 不是的 他们是蓝精灵
No, no, they're called Smurfs.

566
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,800
他们是世界上最可爱的小东西
And they are the sweetest little things you ever did see.

567
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
我不是
Not me.

568
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,010
嗯 你不是 厌厌
No, not you, Grouchy.

569
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,220
蓝爸爸 笨笨
Papa, Clumsy.

574
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,690
哪个鹳如果被他骑着肯定要累死了
I wouldn't want to be the stork that brought that guy.

575
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,530
好吧 如果蓝蓝喜欢蓝精灵 那维克多也喜欢
Well, if Blue likes the Smurfs, then Vicster likes the Smurfs.

576
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:56,650
你们见到我一定很激动吧
What a thrill this must be for all of you.

577
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,490
谢绝照相 谢谢合作
No pictures, please.

578
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,570
这是靓靓
That's Vanity.

自恋狂
Narcissist.

580
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,330
你们来这儿干什么
What are you guys doing here?

581
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,830
蓝妹妹被抓走了
Smurfette's been taken.

582
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,250
-等下 啥  -抓走了 你说抓走了是什么意思
-Wait, what? -Taken? What do you mean "Taken"?

583
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,710
他被可怕的格格巫抓走了
Smurf napped by that ghastly Gargamel.

584
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,580
她自己在外面溜达 因为她觉得我们忘了她的生日
She was off alone because she thought we forgot her birthday.

585
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,130
这是一个误会
There was a misunderstanding.

586
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,840
不过如果我们找到格格巫 就能找到蓝妹妹了
But if we can find him, we'll find her.

587
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,880
呃 这个不难 他现在可是大明星
Well, that shouldn't be hard. He's a big star now.

588
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,890
-他人在巴黎  -我去找人来照顾小狗
-He's in Paris. -I'll call the dog sitter.

00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,220
你去拿蓝蓝的护照

592
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,600
你等下 蓝蓝的护照
Wait a minute, Blue's passport?

593
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,440
巴黎不能这样说去就去吧
We can't just up and go to Paris.

594
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,940
至少不能所有人都去啊
At least, not all of us.

595
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:36,610
好吧 有一票反对 谁投赞成票
Okay, so that's one vote no. Who votes yes?

596
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,860
-我  -当然了
-Me. -Of course.

597

每次都是爸爸输
Daddy always loses.

598
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,410
听着 这可是我的蓝妹妹 我们必须去
Look, this is my Smurfette we're talking about. We have to go.

599
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,660
如果我们要出远门
If we're going to be travelling,

600
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,670
那就一定要按照蓝精灵的惯例来
let's make sure we do this properly.

601
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,570
啦啦啦啦啦啦 唱支快乐歌

606
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,120
-看看蓝妹妹在不在那  -对
-and see if Smurfette's there. -Yes.

607
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,460
然后我去格格巫的宾馆
And I'll go to Gargamel's hotel

608
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,120
想办法找到他住的房间
and see if I can find out what room he's in.

609
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,660
维克多 你和蓝蓝先去开房间住下
And, Victor, you and Blue can just check into the room here.

610
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:33,080

-Well, actually, I was thinking... -No. "Actually, I" Nothing.

你和蓝蓝 上楼去
You and Blue, upstairs.

612

That's the deal. End of story.

613
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,010
去歌剧院 有劳了
L'Opera House, s'il vous plait.

614
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,680
我说法语很性感 对不
My French is tres sexy, non?

615
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,240
对啊 也许可以给你戴上个贝雷帽
Oui, maybe I'll get you a beret.

616
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,720
我戴上贝雷帽 你可把持不住呢
You cannot handle me in a beret.

617
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,720
你这么觉得吗 我不能...
Is that what you think? I can't...

618
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,020
嘿 去开房吧你们

你很想给他的
You want to give it to him.

625
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,580
给了他你就会很开心的
You'll feel better about yourself

626
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,030
别再摆出一副讨厌的小屁孩的样子了
if you stop being such anannoying little brat

627
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,330
还有把配方给他
and give him the formula.

628
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:17,330

汉库斯把知道的都告诉你

631
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,850
汉库斯啥也不知道
Hackus doesn't know anything.

632
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,850
咋回事
What? What?

633
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,730
"缓冲" 啥意思...
"Buffering"? What the...

634
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,480
崇拜者们在等我了
My public awaits.

635
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,650
又得去应付那帮只会傻乐的弱智 让他们又震惊又迷惑 
Once again I must go astound and confound the merry imbeciles.

636
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,650
你说我的精华用光了是什么意思
What do you mean, I'm out of essence?

637
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,030
我们还是可以表演的 放心吧
We can still do the show, all right.

638
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,500
因为现在我们需要的精华就在这个房间里了 对吧
Because we got all the essence we need right here now, don't we?

639
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,040
我只需要剪一点
I'm going to need a little snip.

640
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,830

When my Papa gets here, you're gonna be sorry.

00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,510
你那位蓝爸爸不会来了 因为你的亲爸爸就在这儿
Your Papa is not coming because your real Papa is already here.

645

you can either be a good little girl and give me the formula,

647
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,980
要么你这悲惨的下半辈子就呆在这里
or you can spend the rest of your miserable little existence

648
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,310

658
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,420
我们用这点头发榨出蓝精华
We'll brew this hair into Smurf essence!

659
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,970
蓝爸爸 快来救我啊
Papa, please hurry.

660
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,930
我好怕
I'm so scared.

661
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,350
可怜虫要哭了
Poor baby's gonna cry.

662

667
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,360
格格巫先生住在哪个房间对吗
What room Monsieur Gargamel is in?

668
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,620

我要的效果是神秘气息笼罩全场 这点烟雾糊弄谁呢
I asked for a shroud of mystery. This is a wisp!

这是怎么回事
Where did that come from?

681
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,930
他之前从没有过这么多的能量
He's never had this much power before.

682
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,990
我十分不满意
Well, I am outraged!

683
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,400
极其的不满意
Positively outraged.

684
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,410
不好意思 您是哪位
I'm sorry, who are you?

685
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:37,120
我是格格巫先生的经纪人 朵雷特女士
I am Monsieur Gargamel's manager, Madame Doolittle.

686
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,120
就这种窝棚你们也敢叫房间
What is this outhouse you call a room?

687
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,380
-您是说拿破仑套房吗  -拿破仑套房啊 对
-The Napoleon Suite? -Napoleon Suite? Yes.

688
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,130
但是女士 这是我们酒店最好的房间了
But, Madame, this is the finest room in all the hotel.

689
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,880
你是哪里不满意呢
What could possibly...

690
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:50,130
首先 亲爱的 这个楼层就不对
Well, for starters, darling, it's on the wrong floor.

691
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,180
没人愿意住在...
No one wants to be on the...

692
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,970
-五楼  -对 就是 这也太低了
-The fifth floor. -Yes. Yes, that's much too low.

693
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,470
哦 天啊
Oh, boy.

694
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,310
晚上好 晚上好
Good evening! Good evening!

695
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,770
好了大家 我们现在进去
Okay, guys, we're going in.

696
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,940
不不不
No,no,no.

697
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,440
先生你不可以进来
You may not be in here.

698
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,140
-你会说英语吗  -抱歉 不会
-Do you speak English? -No, I'm sorry.

699
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,150
太好了
Great.

700
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,150
蓝爸爸 这个人完全听不懂我在说什么 
Okay, Papa, sneak out the back of my sweater

701
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,410
趁我俩聊天的时候 从我的毛衣后面滑出去
while I talk to this man who has no idea what I'm saying

702
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,860
找到他的化妆间
and go find that dressing room.

703
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,790
这真是个完美假期啊
This is a great vacation, guys.

704
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,160
我紧张得都快化掉了
I can feel the stress melting right off me.

705
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,330
-别叽歪了 厌厌  -是啊 我们能做到的
-Don't spiral, Grouchy. -Yeah. We got this.

706
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:26,080
-先生们 猫咪警报  -下来 快下来
-Gentlemen, we have a cat problem. -Get down, get down.

707
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,920
就这样 不 别害怕
There! No, no, don't be alarmed.

708
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,170
批评我的人都是这下场
This is how I treat all the critics.

709
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,140
快 从绳子爬上去
Hurry, up those ropes.

710
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,010
为了救个蓝妹妹值得吗
Is Smurfette really worth all this?

711
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,430
-我就随便一说  -我们走
-I'm just saying. -Let's go.

712
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,060
-没有许可 禁止入内  -什么 这也太过分了吧
-Not permis. Not permis. -What? This is outrageous.

713
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,140
你们的家人将会付出巨大的代价
Your families will all pay dearly.

714
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,850
最后 你们有些人会死
As a result, some of you may die.

715
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,240
-您好  -您好
-Bonjour! -Bonjour!

716
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:00,240
-你需要刷门卡  -嗯 谢谢 好啊
-You need your card. -Yes, thank you. It's good.

717
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,250
抱歉 您需要刷门卡
No, I'm sorry, you will need your key card.

718
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,080
当然啦 亲爱的 我的门卡啊
Yes, of course, darling, my key card!

719
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,210
天啊 我弄丢了
Oh, dear, I've left it.

720
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:13,210
{\a6}奥黛丽•赫本的著名电影《蒂凡尼的早餐》

721
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:13,210
啊哦 我之前在蒂凡尼吃了个早饭
Oui, I was having breakfast at Tiffany's.

722
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,470
我还是回去拿吧
I'll just go back and get it.

723
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:23,470
{\a9}
员工换衣间

724
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,310
我爬绳子时 臀肌一定很好看
I bet my glutes look great climbing up this rope.

725
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,900
厌厌 看路
Grouchy, take a look.

726
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,030
我讨厌我的人生
I hate my life.

727
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,280
-笨笨  -快爬
-Clumsy! -Move it.

728
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,410
...打断了我的魔法 至少能逗我一笑
...Interrupt my sorcery, at least I should be amused.

729
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,570
现在 你们都会很发自内心的
Now, you will all kindly hail

730
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,080
为伟大且富有魔力的格格巫喝彩...
to the great and exceedingly powerful Gargamel...

731
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,500
你出来干什么 胆子大了啊
What are you doing out here? How dare you?

732
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,460
你闻到奇怪的味道了 那有什么奇怪的
You smell something suspicious? Well, of course you do!

733
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,040
别以为我不知道你平时都把鼻子放哪
I've seen where you put your nose.

734
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,670
快 滚出去
Now, get out of here.

735
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,840
嘿 爸爸
Hi, Daddy.

736
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,300
-蓝蓝  -嗯 嗯 听着
-Blue? -Yeah, yeah, yeah, just listen...

737
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,430
蓝蓝和我决定不能让你一个人单独行动
Blue and I decided we can't let you run solo on this.

738
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,550
我们要一起
We can do this together.

739
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,620
三位道尔家的男人
Three generations of proud

740
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,260
要自豪地并肩作战 
Doyle men standing shoulder to shoulder.

741
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,430
即使我们身高什么的完全不同
Even though we're all different heights and whatnot.

742
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,770
我们不姓道尔
We are not Doyle men.

743
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,150
温斯洛-道尔
Winslow-hyphen-Doyle.

744
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,230
你就是不敢正视你的全名
You have a bee in your bonnet about the whole name thing.

745
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
你们在笑什么
Why do you chortle?

746
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,530
通常 在表演魔术的时候 猫不都是很大的吗
Usually, in magic, the cats are big, no?

747
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,780
就像老虎或者狮子那么大
Like tiger or like lions, you know?

748
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,410
安静点 混蛋 我会大发慈悲地满足你的
Silence, knave! And allow me to oblige you.

749
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,490
阿拉卡扎猫猫变
Alakazanimal!

750
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,210
尽量别让自己闻着太香
Try not to smell delicious!

751
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,800
目前看来 这是我这辈子最糟糕的旅行
So far, this is the worst trip of my life!

752
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,340
我总共就旅行过两次
And I've only taken two!

753
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:42,140
-快看 格格巫的化妆间在那  -眼神不错 靓靓
-Look! There's Gargamel's dressing room. -Good eye, Vanity.

754
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,220
拜托 居然在门上贴了个五角星
Please! He's got a star on his door.

755
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,350
我们走
Let's go.

756
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,730
回去记得提醒我也在我的蘑菇门上贴个五角星
Remind me to put a star on my mushroom when we get home.

757
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,730
-如果我们想要变成蓝色的话...  -蓝色
-If we ever want to be blue... -Blue.

758
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,690
...必须得想个办法让她松口
...we've got to come up with some way to get her talking.

759
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,570
-是啊  -想到什么了吗
-Yeah. -Got any ideas?

760
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,030
我知道了 跟她说"求你了"
I got it! Say "Please."

761
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,860
算了吧 我忘了你是 你
Never mind. I forgot you were you.

762
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,700
-听好我的计划  -好的
-All right, here's my plan. -Okay.

763
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,790
我们想办法把她变成跟我们一样 变得淘气
We trick her into acting like us, being naughty.

764
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,910
淘气 淘气
Naughty, naughty!

765
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,290
我们利用她的善良来对付她
We use all her goodness against her.

766
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:14,130
一旦我们成功了 她就会觉得和我们是一家人了
Once that happens, she'll feel like she's part of our family!

767
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,380
一家人 我喜欢家人
Family! I like family!

768
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,920
我喜欢这计划
I love this plan!

769
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,170
-噢 不  -家庭破碎了
-Oh, no! -Broken family!

770
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,640
-抓住她  -抓住她 抓住蓝妹妹
-Get her! -Catch her! Catch Smurfette!

771
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,600
再见了 捣蛋鬼们
See you later, Smurfigators!

772
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,430
爸爸会杀了我们的 快追
Father's gonna kill us! Go faster!

773
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:32,190
-再会了 丑八怪  -抓住她
-Au revoir, trolls! -Get her!

774
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,230
-有人吗  -蓝妹妹
-Hello? -Smurfette?

775
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,560
-你在哪啊  -问个小问题
-Where are you? -Quick question.

776
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,730
既然我们能爬这么高 为什么不去用门把手
How is it we can't reach a doorknob, but we can get up here?

777
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,030
不 笨笨 不要啊
No, Clumsy, don't! No, no!

778
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,000
你刚刚被空气打败了
You just lost a fight to an empty room.

779
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,080
怎么都没人上来陪猫咪玩
Nobody wants to come up here

780
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,330
你们那些刚才吵吵嚷嚷强烈要求要更大猫咪的人呢
and play with the larger kitty that they so annoyingly asked for!

781
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,460
你得走了 快点
You have to go! Now!

782
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,590
-好的 只要找到蓝妹妹我们就走  -是的
-Yeah, soon as we get the Smurfette. -Yeah!

783
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,800
-就算它把你吃掉了 你也会被它咳出来的  -嘿
-He coughs up everything he eats. -You!

784
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,130
变戏法的 给我把蓝妹妹交出来
Magic man, hand over the Smurfette.

785
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,800
你刚刚说什么
What did you just say?

786
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,550
没听到吗
You heard me.

787
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,930
给我把蓝妹妹交出来 快点
Give me the Smurfette! Now!

788
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,640
你怎么敢 阿拉卡...
How dare you? Alaka...

789
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:12,940
-闪开鸭  -鸭鸭变
-Duck! -...duck!

790
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,560
鸭鸭变
Duck?

791
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,610
这咋...回事啊
That was...up.

792
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,240
不
No!

793
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,320
是你
You.

794
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:27,700
我的个祖师爷啊 我认得你
By great Merlin's beard, I remember you!

795
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,660
我们又见面了 哈
We meet again, eh?

796
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,170
爸爸飞起来了 爸爸飞起来了
Daddy's flying! Daddy's flying!

797
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,840
好了 好了 好了 看来我们终于找到了一位志愿者
Well, well, well, it appears we have a volunteer after all!

798
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:45,050
巡游的差不多了 嘴张开 阿兹猫
Enough fooling around, yes? Open wide, Azrael.

799
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,010
放他下来 格格蠢货
Put him down, Gargafella!

800
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,890
放开我儿子
Leave my son alone!

801
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,270
我来给你上一课吧 别招惹我们道尔鸭
I'll teach you to mess with us Doyle ducks!

802
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,620
又是你
You again!

803
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,870
你干什么 放我下来
What are you doing? Put me down!

804
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,040
快走 蓝蓝
Come on, Blue.

805
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,580
放我下来 我马上就要搞定他了 就差一点点
Put me down! I could have taken him! I had him!

806
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,800
恐怕今天的演出就到这里了
I'm afraid that's all the show we have time for.

807
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,460
再见
Good bye.

808
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,920
赶紧的 都出去吧 快滚吧
Go on, get out, get out, get out.

809
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,180
这是蓝妹妹的头发 她来过这里
Smurfette's hair. She's been here.

810
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,180
快看 我找到了什么
Look! I found something.

811
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,850
一副完美的肖像画
A portrait of perfection.

812
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,640
想象一下 如果你在帮忙的话看起来就更帅了
Imagine how good you'd look if you were actually helping.

813
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,640
长的帅又不是我的错 谁让大家都爱美呢
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

814
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,980
-蓝妹妹  -蓝妹妹
-Smurfette? -Smurfette?

815
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,270
嘿 这是咖啡吗
Hey, is that coffee?

816
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,480
有谁想要来一别咖啡哦
Anyone else want a cup 0' joe?

817
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,650
嘿 那是啥
Hey, what's that?

818
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,570
这是面镜子 你这个乡巴佬
It's a mirror, you barbarian.

819
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,450
别臭美了 靓靓 快推
Snap out of it, Vanity, and push!

820
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,160
坏脾气优先 帅脸蛋接后
Rage before beauty.

821
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,750
不知道这是什么 但是让人毛骨悚然的
Whatever this is, it's making my butt scrunch.

822
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:00,210
有点吓人 我是说...
That's a little scary. I mean...

823
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,460
格格巫
Gargamel!

824
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:07,720
笨笨 你想害我们被抓吗
Clumsy! Are you trying to get us smurfed?

825
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,180
这大概是什么魔法窗口
It's some sort of magic window.

826
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,060
也许它会告诉我们蓝妹妹在哪呢
Maybe it'll show us where Smurfette is.

827
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,100
淘气精灵
Naughties?

828
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,310

831
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,480
跑哪去了 在吗

832
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,320
-快点 孩子们  -他过来了 快点

-孩子们 蓝妹妹  -往后 往后
-Children? Smurfette? -Back up, back up.

835
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,620
关门 快关门
Close the door! Close the door!

836
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,240
你们的爸爸回来了哦
Your papa is back.

837
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,200
她的爸爸
Her papa?

838
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,910
如果这是个玩笑 我告诉你我可一点都不喜欢
If this is a joke, I assure you I don't find it funny.

839
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,630
-有人吗  -拿住了
-Hello? -Hold it!

840
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:44,550
-你们在下面吗 你们这些小混蛋  -站稳了
-Are you down there, you little delinquents? -Keep still.

841
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,630
他们肯定是逃回酒店去了
They must have retreated back to the hotel.

842
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,050
我们肯定没多少时间了
Of course we're running out of time.

843
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,930
如果帕特里克在这里 那蓝爸爸一定也在附近
If that Patrick person is here, then Papa cannot be far behind.

844
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,020
快点 回酒店去 我们一定要在蓝爸爸之前赶到
Quickly, to the hotel! We must get to her before he does.

845
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,940
我的脸啊 我的脸啊
My face! My face!

846
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,400
-怎么了  -简直帅呆了
-What? -It's gorgeous.

847
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,950
我们摔下来了 这次居然不是我的错
We fell, and it wasn't even my fault!

848
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,160
有人吗 有人吗
Anyone? Anyone?

849
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,080
我的老天啊
Oh, my Smurf.

850
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,960
我又开始发抖了
I'm scrunching again.

851
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:27,340
爸爸 这些东西和蓝妹妹有什么关系
Papa, what does this have to do with Smurfette?

852
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,920
恐怕 这一切都是针对她的
Everything, I'm afraid.

853
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,140
他为什么要造这么恐怖的机器
Why would he build such a hideous device?

854
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,760
那是个超大的蓝精灵精华提取机吗
Is that a giant Smurfalator?

855
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,680
是用来提取我们的精华的
To extract our essence.

856
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,560
这些容器又是用来做什么的
What are all those containers for?

857
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,980
九十九个用来囚禁蓝精灵的瓶子
Ninety-nine bottles of Smurf on the wall.

858
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,900
那么如果蓝妹妹把配方给了他...
So if Smurfette gives him the formula...

859
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,210
他就可以把淘气精灵
He can turn as many Naughties

860
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:53,280
变成蓝精灵 他想要多少有多少
into Smurfs as his greedy heart desires.

861
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,030
伙计们
Guys?

862
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,030

Need a catch, please.

865

这地方真需要加强回收啊
This place really needs to recycle.

866
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,970
快动脑子 蓝妹妹 快想想 哦 不
Think, Smurfette, think. Oh, no!

867
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,220
-蓝妹妹哪去了 哪去了  -她在那
-Where's Smurfette? Where's Smurfette? -There she is!

868
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,640
她跑得真快 我喜欢这个游戏
She's fast! I love this game!

869
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,310
慢着 就让她跑她的 她也没地方可去
Wait! Let's let her run for a bit. She's got nowhere to go.

870
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,440
-这太有利于我的计划了  -好的 好的
-This is perfect for my plan! -Yeah, yeah.

871
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,230
你生的什么气 被变成鸭子的是我
What are you so cross about? I'm the duck!

872
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,140
你总是半路杀出来 把一切都搞得乱七八糟
You always barge in and ruin everything!

873
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,490
你就是个扫把星
You're like a walking disaster!

874
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,240
嘿 看着我的眼睛认真的说一遍
Hey, look me in the eyes and say that.

875
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,740
-我做不到  -这就对了 因为你说的不对
-I can't. -That's right, because it's not true.

876
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,540
不 是因为你的眼睛长在了脑袋的两边
No, I can't because your eyes are on the sides of your head!

877
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,370
所以我更能看出你对我一点也不尊重
All the better for me to see your disrespect!

878
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,340
-你们看什么看  -快走吧
-What are you looking at? -Hurry up.

That's Victor. Gargamel turned him into a duck.

我这么说了 我就这么说了

Is it her birthday? Really? Who cares?

948
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:28,260
送个礼物吗 送个蛋糕吗
A present? A cake?

949
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,390
对她好一点吗
Be nice to her?

950
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:37,320
给点甜头 拍拍马屁让她的铁石心肠软下来 对吗
Bribery and flattery to soften her stony little heart, eh?

951
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,440
听起来真不是我的作风 但是有可能会成功啊
That's counterintuitive, but that just might work.

952
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:43,200
我简直太英明神武了
I'm so glad I thought of this!

953
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,610
让我想想...
Let's see...

954
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:47,370
好了好了
All right, all right.

955
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,080
我该送她什么礼物呢
What kind of gift should I get her?

956
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,330
-猫咪 猫咪 猫咪  -嘿 满嘴鱼腥味的家伙
-Kitty, kitty, kitty! -Hey, fish breath!

957
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,540
别闹 阿兹猫 我在想要送什么礼物
Not now, Azrael, I'm trying to think of

958
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,360
显得又真诚又体贴
a genuine and heartfelt gift

959
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,920
来蒙蔽蓝妹妹呢
that I can deceive that Smurfette with!

960
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,340
我说了别闹
I said not now!

961
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:05,050
别闹 别闹 别闹 别闹
Not now! Not now! Not now!

962
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,850
你自己走回去吧
You are walking home.

963
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,350
臭猫
Cats.

964
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:13,520
快一点 再快一点
Faster! Faster!

965
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,600
劳驾 对不起
Excuse us! Sorry!

966
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,190
要怎么把这玩意儿停下来啊
How are we gonna stop this thing?

967
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,690
我觉得应该不难
I don't think that's gonna be a problem!

968
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,690
安全着陆
And she sticks the landing!

969
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,320
-美味的布丁  -汉库斯 这是泥巴
-Yummy pudding! -Hackus, it's mud.

970
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,030
美味的泥巴
Yummy mud!

971
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,250
放马过来啊 臭猫
Take your best shot, cat!

972
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,040
小心
Watch out!

973
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,420
太棒了
Yes!

974
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,550
-干得漂亮 我们走  -干得漂亮 我们走
-Nice shot! Let's go! -Nice shot! Let's go!

975
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:45,970
-快走  -再不走就迟了 汉库斯
-Come on! -Move it or lose it, Hackus!

976
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,220
哦不 生气的猫咪 生气的猫咪 快跑
Oh, no! Angry kitty! Angry kitty! Run!

977
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,560
好的美女们 展示下你们的肚子
Okay, ladies, act pregnant.

978
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,850
-这边 伙计们  -快点
-This way, guys! -Faster!

979
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,730
-现在该要飞了  -快点
-It's time to get your wings! -Faster!

980
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,060
快点 到鹳鸟身上去
Quick, get on the storks!

981
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,350
我们走
Let's go!

982
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,440
等下 汉库斯在哪里
Wait, where's Hackus?

983
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,940
快飞啊 大鹳鸟 快飞
Fly, big stork, fly!

984
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,820
猫咪来啦 小心啊
Here comes kitty! Look out!

985
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,400
来吧 汉库斯 我们走
Come on, Hackus! Let's go!

986
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,200
耶
Yeah!

987
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,040
嘿快看 落水猫
Hey, look, it's a catfish!

988
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,290
再见咯 猫咪
Bye, kitty!

989
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,500
简直太棒了
This is amazing!

990
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,170
鹳鸟在向后飞 鹳鸟在向后飞
Stork going backwards! Stork going backwards!

991
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,930
真是太美啦
This is so beautiful!

992
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,350
我掉下去了 我掉下去了
I'm falling! I'm falling!

993
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:36,020
蓝妹妹是我的英雄
Smurfette's my hero!

994
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,560
-事情怎么样了  -实在是太棒了
-How did it go? -Couldn't have gone better.

995
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,270
只不过所有事情都是大灾难而已
Except that everything was a complete smurftastrophe.

996
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,480
这就是蓝精灵定律
It's Smurfy's Law.

997
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,820
我倒是有个好消息
Well, I have some good news.

998
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,330
我给你搞了一套服务员的衣服
I borrowed a waiter's outfit for you,

999
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:52,410
包括一张坐电梯用的门卡
complete with a security card for the elevator.

1000
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,620
你是怎么做到的
How did you manage that?

1001
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,690
这么说吧 国际服装检查员
Let's just say that the Plaza Athenee

1002
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,080
朵雷特小姐小小地拜访了一下
laundry room was paid a little visit

1003
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:01,210
雅特尼大酒店的洗衣房
by international apparel inspector Mademoiselle Doolittle.

1004
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,170
{\a6}梅丽尔•斯特里普 著名好莱坞女明星

1005
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,570
我简直就像梅丽尔•蓝精灵•斯特里普
I was like Meryl smurf in' Streep.

1006
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:05,750
干得漂亮 格蕾丝
Good job, Grace!

1007
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,340
是每个人都有新衣服 还是只有帕特里克有呢
Does everyone get a new outfit, or just Patrick?

1008
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,090
-该死的窗户  -那是什么
-Bloody window. -What was that?

1009
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,220
是维克多
That's Victor.

1010
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,720
保安不让他从大厅里进来 所以他飞上来了
They wouldn't let him through the lobby, so he flew up.

1011
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,810
眼睛撞瞎了
No depth perception.

1012
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,810
维多多爷爷是一只鸭子
Grandpa Vicster is a duck!

1013
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,310
格格巫对他施了咒语
Gargamel zapped him.

1014
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:23,810
你能把他变回来的对吧
You can change him back, right?

1015
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,530
不能 不过这是个变形咒语
No, but it's a transformation spell.

1016
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:28,150
过一段时间就会消失的
It'll wear off eventually.

1017
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,570
大家放轻松啦 这根本不是问题
Everybody relax. It's not a problem.

1018
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,160
但是如果谁看到我下了个蛋 那就别到处宣扬了
But if you see me lay an egg, it's just between us.

1019
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,830
你好像并不难过啊
You don't seem too upset about this.

1020
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,210
鸭子天生不会难过
It's not in a duck's nature to get upset.

1021
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:41,870
我们喜欢把事情抛在脑后
We like to let things roll off our backs.

1022
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,250
真的吗 你是认真说的吗
Seriously? You seriously just said that?

1023
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,170
-我喜欢 你很像蓝精灵  -非常像
-I like that. That's very smurfy of you. -Very smurfy.

1024
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,550
是吗 谢谢你 看见没
Why, thank you. See?

1025
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,760
这个圣诞老人蓝精灵欣赏我
The little Santa Claus Smurf appreciates me.

1026
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,010
或许有一天 帕特里克
Maybe someday, Patrick,

1027
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,720
你也能学会欣赏我身上的蓝精灵特质
you'll learn to appreciate my smurfy qualities, too!

1028
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:56,930
好吧 我... 这实在... 算了吧...
Okay. I've... There's... You know...

1029
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,890
我才不要和一只鸭子讨论这个
I'm not having this conversation with a duck.

1030
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,440
现在我又感冒了
Now I'm catching a cold.

1031
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,770
我还希望我感冒了呢
I wish I had a cold.

1032
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,110
健健的水晶滑进了我的喉咙
I've had Hefty's crystal shoved down my throat,

1033
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:09,030
我被一只玉米热狗袭击 还掉进了下水道
got attacked as a corn dog, fell down a sewer,

1034
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,530
这还不算最臭的
and if that wasn't smelly enough,

1035
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,070
我还被夹在腋窝里走来走去
had to travel by armpit

1036
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:15,700
最后发现我们要灭绝了
just to find out we're all gonna be extinct!

1037
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:20,410
-我的老天爷啊 我是个消极者  -相当正确
-Holy smurf, I'm a downer. -You most certainly are.

1038
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,820
厌厌 只有蓝妹妹把秘方交给了格格巫
Grouchy, the only way we'll be extinct is if Smurfette

1039
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:25,670
我们才会通通灭绝
 gives Gargamel the secret formula.

1040
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,000
-但是蓝妹妹一定不会说的  -当然不会
-But Smurfette would never tell. -Of course not.

1041
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,300
-不可能的  -绝对不会
-Never. -Absolutely not.

1042
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,260
蓝妹妹不可能被骗 成为他们的一员的
Smurfette could never be tricked into being one of them.

1043
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,510
嘿 蓝妹妹
Hey, Smurfette.

1044
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:37,050
在蓝精灵村 你会和你的姐妹一起这样玩吗
Did you do this with your sisters back in Smurf Village?

1045
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,640
我经常飞 但是我没有姐妹
Lots of flying, but I never had a sister.

1046
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,390
好吧 你现在有姐妹了啊
Well, you do now.

1047
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:55,060
{\a6}This Is What Rock N Roll Looks Like by Porcelain Black

1048
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,060
-想要比赛吗  -你想和我比赛啊
-Want to race? -You want to race me?

1049
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:47,730
那你可小心了
You're in trouble now!

1050
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,610
-我要甩掉你了 蓝妹妹  -想都别想
-I'm gonna lose you, Smurfette. -Not a chance.

1051
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,160
看好啦
Watch out!

1052
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,830
抓紧了 汉库斯
Hold on tight, Hackus.

1053
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,790
-别抓这么紧啊  -对不起
-Not that tight, Hackus. -Sorry.

1054
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,840
长空击鹳
Stork fight!

1055
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,210
我们来了
Coming through!

1056
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:14,760
这太疯狂了
This is insane!

1057
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,430
蓝精灵飞啊飞
Smurf, smurf, and away.

1058
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:22,430
乘鹳之王 汉库斯
Hackus, king of world!

1059
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,520
你开始耍阴招了啊
You're playing dirty now!

1060
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,400
这才是刚开始呢
I'm just getting started.

1061
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,980
冲啊冲
GO, go!

1062
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,070
好一个薄煎饼蓝妹妹啊
I call that a Crepe Smurfette.

1063
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,820
外带一份蜗牛吗
Snails to go?

1064
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,990
-连续开火  -来啊
-Batter up! -Come on!

1065
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,200
好好瞄准了再打啊
Hit me with your best shot.

1066
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:43,830
搞定她了
Snailed her!

1067
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:46,040
-你可真会捣蛋啊 蓝妹妹  -那当然
-You are naughty, Smurfette. -Yeah.

1068
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:53,630
嘿 我在哪儿见过这个女人
Hey! I've seen that lady before.

1069
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:55,340
她长的真漂亮
She's beautiful.

1070
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,470
好像哪儿都有她
They've got one of these everywhere.

1071
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,550
我要掐死那个该死的鸭子
I'm gonna strangle that duck.

1072
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,680
维克多就像衰神附体一样到处跟着我
Vic's like a black cloud that follows me around.

1073
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,140
好吧 听着 我知道你想说什么
Okay, look, I get it.

1074
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:07,140
但是你得这样想 他来了不是吗
But you know what, he's here, isn't he?

1075
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,560
他最终还是来了
He shows up.

1076
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,520
是啊 不管你到底想不想要他来 他都会来
Yeah, whether you want him to or not.

1077
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:13,150
好吧 但是人们常说一位父亲只要能陪着孩子就不错了
Okay, I always heard that showing up was 90% of the job.

1078
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:15,400
有很多父亲甚至都做不到这一点
A lot of fathers don't even do that.

1079
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,320
可他不是我的父亲
He's not my father.

1080
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:19,410
那太可惜了
Well, that's too bad.

1081

You heard it. I'm tired of being Grouchy.

1095
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,030
我要转变风格做个积极向上的精灵了
I am changing my tune to a happy one.

00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:04,270
在对她做着什么惨无人道的卑鄙事情
something mean and horrible to her right now.

1214
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,770
对啊 蓝妹妹需要我们 她也许正害怕又...
Yeah, Smurfette needs us. She's probably scared and...

1215
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,360
-一家人最棒啦  -什么...
-I love family! -What...

1216
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,240
她在做什么
What is she doing?

1217
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,320
我猜他们在抱抱吧
I think they're hugging.

1218
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:16,570
爸爸
Papa?

1219
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,330
汉库斯爱抱抱
Hackus love to hug.

1220
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:19,790
汉库斯
Hackus.

1221
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:22,410
蓝妹妹 过来 给你看样好东西
Smurfette, come on, I got to show you something.

1222
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:27,170
看看咱俩 来看 咱俩长的就像一家人
Look at us. Come on, tell me we're not family.

1223
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,960
蓝妹妹
Smurfette!

1224
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,170
看这边
Over here!

1225
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,300
蓝妹妹
Smurfette!

1226
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:36,430
很抱歉蓝爸爸没来找你
I'm sorry Papa Smurf didn't come for you.

1227
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:41,010
不过也许你本来就属于这里 跟我们在一起
But maybe your place is here with us.

1228
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,980
对啊
Yeah.

1229
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:45,600
也许是呢
Maybe it is.

1230
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,270
她怎么跟那些家伙那么亲
Why is she being nice to them?

1231
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,470
她只是在与绑架者产生共鸣
She's just identifying with her captors.

1232
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:52,110
{\a6}被害者对于犯罪者产生情感 甚至反过来帮助犯罪者的一种情结

1233
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:52,110
典型的斯德哥尔摩综合症
It's classic Smurf-holm syndrome.

1234
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:56,400
不 她觉得我们不再关心她了 而那几个家伙在乎她
No, she thinks we don't care anymore, and they do.

1235
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:57,780
她糊涂了
She's confused.

1236
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,160
笨笨 厌厌 上去帮我把门打开
Clumsy, Grouchy, get up there, and help me get this door open.

1237
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,330
-我闺女在里面呢  -好的 爸爸
-That's my daughter in there! -Okay, Papa.

1238
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:05,540
-我去上面  -好的 厌厌你来跳 我来拉
-I'll get on top. -Okay, Grouchy, you jump, I'll pull.

1239
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,080
-加油 没问题的  -孩子们
-Come on, we can do this. -Children.

1240
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:11,290
-格格巫  -笨笨 别松手
-Gargamel! -Clumsy, don't let go...

1241
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,210
爸爸回来啦
Daddy's home.

1242
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:18,260
他心地特别善良 还给你带礼物了哦
And consistent with his kind nature, he brought you a present.

1243
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:19,590
厌厌快下来 他会看见你的
Grouchy, get down. He'll see you.

1244
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,970
-现在我们怎么救她  -嘘
-How are we gonna rescue her now? -Quiet.

1245
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,770
我想我们之前有点误会
I do believe we got off on the wrong foot earlier.

1246
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:25,890
咋回事
What's happening?

1247
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:29,730
可不可以允许我祝我的小心肝生日快乐啊
Would you allow me to wish you a very, very happy birthday?

1248
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,270
我还记得当年你只是
It seems like only yesterday

1249
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,860
一团小粘土和一些烂材料的样子
you were just my little

1250
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,610
这一切好像昨天的事儿一样啊
glob of clay and other putrid ingredients.

1251
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:40,410
你记得我的生日吗
You remembered my birthday?

1252
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:42,910
当然了 我们是一家人嘛
Of course I did. We're family.

1253
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,490
-什么  -但我们才是她的家人
-What? -But we're her family.

1254
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:47,370
她觉得我们不要她了吗
Does she think we abandoned her?

1255
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,980
说到这 你那蓝乎乎的小个子
Speaking of which, your little

1256
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:51,080
继父一直都没到 他现在来了吗
blue step-papa never did arrive, now did he?

1257
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,500
继父
Step-Papa?

1258
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:56,010
怎么搞的 我真为你很难过 亲爱的 你一定很痛心吧
Why, I am truly sorry, my dear. That must really sting.

1259
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,970
我还记得我爸爸
I remember when my father

1260
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,640
第一次把我扔到井里的时候
threw me down the well for the first time.

1261
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:04,580
当我终于想尽了办法爬出来
The disappointed look on his

1262
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:07,980
他那脸上失望的表情啊
face when I finally managed to claw my way out.

1263
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:12,150
不提这些了 生日快乐 亲爱的
Anyway, happy birthday, my dear.

1264
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,900
-生日快乐 蓝妹妹  -生日快乐 蓝妹妹
-Happy birthday, Smurfette! -Happy birthday, Smurfette!

1265
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:16,480
-我要拆  -让我来拆  -不 不不
-I want to open! Let me open! -No, no, no.

1266
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:17,860
丑死了
Ugly.

1267
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,540
"鞠躬 给我跪下 崇拜我吧"
"Bow. Kneel. Worship me."

Yes, delightful rendition, really.

1269

Keep it up, no-neck, I'll turn you into a cross-eyed newt.

1270
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,960
没错 亲爱的
Yes, yes, my dear.

1271
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,550
来啊 拿着它
Go ahead, take it.

1272
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,890
属于你的神奇小小魔杖哦
It's a tiny little magical wand of your very own.

1273
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:45,890
快 这是你的生日礼物呢
Go ahead. It's your birthday present.

1274
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,900
不
No.

1275
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,520
别拿啊
Don't do it.

1276
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,610
喜欢吗
Do you like it?

1277
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,280
哎呀我太笨了 我忘记把它打开了
Silly me. I've forgotten to turn it on.

1278
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,120
在这儿呢
Here we are.

1279
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:09,040
对 这就对了
Yes, there we go.

1280

Yes, go ahead, try it out. Don't be afraid.

1281
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,960
-龙之魔杖  -哦 天呐
-A Dragon Wand. -Oh, dear.

1282
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:21,090
毕竟 这就是你生来的使命
After all, it is your birthright.

1283
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:24,390
你怎么知道我不会用它来对付你
How do you know I won't use it on you?

1284
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:26,600
这个嘛...
Well...

1285
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:31,100
因为 蓝妹妹 我是你爸爸啊

01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,020
-她会打他的  -放倒他 蓝妹妹
-She's gonna zap him. -Get him, Smurfette.

1288
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:38,530
蓝妹妹...
Smurfette...

1289
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:40,530
唱啦啦歌
Sing The La La Song.

快唱
Sing it!

1291
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,250
这是好事儿 是不 爸爸
This is good, right, Papa?

1292
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:54,830
不 她要变成他们一伙的了
No! She's becoming one of them!

1293
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,590
我一直想这么干来着
I have always wanted to do this!

1294
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:02,340
我们要失去她了
We're losing her.

1295
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:05,840
-好样的 蓝妹妹  -你的第一次欺负猫啊
-Yes! Good one, Smurfette. -Your first cat zap.

看看你哦 看看你
Look at you. Look at you.

你真是爸爸的好女儿
You truly are daddy's little girl.

1298
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:16,770
-蓝妹妹  -不要 爸爸 厌厌 抓住他
-Smurfette! -No, Papa! Grouchy, grab him!

1299
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,570
-不 爸爸 他会看见你的  -把他拽下来
-No, Papa, he's gonna see you! -Get him down!

1300
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,360
-笨笨 帮我 帮我把他拉下来  -爸爸 不要啊
-Clumsy, help, help me get him down! -Papa,no!

1301
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,690

1304
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:40,340

尽情的拿我开涮吧 搞笑君 
Joke it up, funny boy, but I

1307
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,050
但我很自豪自己是自由斗士
am proud as a peacock to be a freedom flighter.

1308
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,720

Oh, no.

1309
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:48,680

哦哦 别慌张
Okay, don't panic.

1315
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,360
好大一坨大白肉
That is a lot of white meat.

1316
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,570
现在该慌了
Now panic!

1317
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,400
好讨厌的感觉啊
Me no likey!

1318
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,290
太精彩了
That was brilliant.

1319
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,870
-他裸着呢 对吧  -大家都还好吗
-He's naked, right? -Everyone okay?

1320
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:19,080
救命 有人吗 有人在吗 放我出去
Help me, somebody. Somebody please, let me out!

1321
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,590
别问我在那下面看见了什么
I have seen unspeakable things down there.

1322
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,680
小小的内心留下了不可磨灭的伤痕
I have been scarred for life.

1323
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,050
蓝妹妹呢
Where's Smurfette?

1324
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:35,020
-她...  -蓝妹妹呢
-She's. .. -Where's Smurfette?

1325

We were too late.

1326

Have fun, children. Just remember, be kind to each other.

1328
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,080
你能不能离我远点 你个呜呜叫的蠢货
Will you get away from me, you bumbling moron?

1329
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,830
-他们哪去了  -啥
-Where are they? -What?

1330
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:56,750
蓝精灵来过吗 来这个屋子吗 你怎么不早说
Smurfs were here? In this room? Why didn't you say so?

1331
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:58,500
我有机会说吗
Right now!

1332
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:01,580
不能让她知道
She must not learn of this.

1333
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:06,920
我们要把她骗走 现在就拿到配方
We must spirit her away from here and get that formula now.

1334
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:10,430
蓝妹妹 亲爱的 你准备好去庆祝了吗
Smurfette, my dear, are you ready to go celebrate?

1335
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:12,180
-好啊  -来吧来吧 一定很好玩
-Yeah! -Come on, come on. This'll be fun.

1336
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:15,430
我们差一点点就能把蓝妹妹救回来了
We were this close to getting Smurfette back.

1337
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,520
我知道
I know.

1338
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,390
他就在这个节骨眼儿上给我找事儿 格蕾丝
He distracted me at the worst possible moment, Grace.

1339
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,270
要不是他 我应该在电梯里面的
I would have been in the elevator if it wasn't for him.

1340
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:22,730

Okay, okay, use your indoor voice,

1341

好了 帕特里克 深呼吸
and please, Patrick, just breathe.

1342
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:25,860
我想让他走
I want him gone.

1343
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:28,740
-他是你爸爸  -不 他根本不是
-He's your dad. -No, that's one thing he is not.

1344
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:31,110
他说的对 格蕾丝 我不是他爸爸
He's right, Grace. I'm not his father.

1345
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:34,660
他的亲生爸爸抛弃了他 组建了新的家庭
His real father left and started a new family.

1346
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:37,410
他一直都过不去这个坎儿
He's been chewed up about it ever since.

1347
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,170
-抱歉你说啥  -我是很抱歉
-Excuse me? -As well you might.

1348
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:43,840
但是我没法再承受你的这种压力了
But I can't take the brunt of it anymore.

1349
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,550
嘿 我从来没求着你闯进我的生活 好吗
Hey, I never asked for you to come barging into my life, okay?

1350
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,550
我也没让你娶我妈妈 没让你把宙斯送走
I didn't ask you to marry my mother or take away Zeus.

1351
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:54,100
宙斯 那只鸽子吗
Zeus? The pigeon?

1352
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,260
是鹦鹉
The parrot.

1353
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:57,930
我的鹦鹉
My parrot.

1354
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:01,100
它被带走了 就因为你过敏
Taken away because you were allergic.

1355
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,150
不是我对那只鸟过敏 帕特里克
I was not allergic to that bird, Patrick.

1356
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,480
是 就是你
Yes, you were.

1357
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,530
过敏的不是我
No, I wasn't.

1358
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:11,650
是你
You were.

1359
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,660
什么
What?

1360
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:17,040
你当时症状很严重 每天都气喘 咳嗽 
It got so bad, every day, you were wheezing, coughing.

1361
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:19,580
你妈妈和我都知道 如果告诉你
Your mother and I both knew that it would break your heart

1362
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:22,210
是因为你鹦鹉才被送走 你会很伤心
to think the bird had to go away because of you.

1363
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,750
你已经为你爸爸的事而自责了
You already blamed yourself for your dad.

1364
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:26,090
所以才说是因为我
So I took the heat.

1365
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,510
不可能 你说什...我才不对鸟类过敏
That's a lie. What are you... I'm not allergic to birds.

1366
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:32,930
好吧 试试
Okay, tell you what.

1367
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:34,510
闻闻这羽毛
Sniff my feathers.

1368
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:37,220
-我才不闻呢  -快点 闻闻
-I'm not going to... -Come on, sniff them.

1369
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,020
事实如此 很痒 是吧 
Truth itches, doesn't it?

1370
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,990
听着 帕特里克
Listen to me, Patrick.

1371
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:54,360
我真心实意爱你妈妈
I loved your mother with all my heart.

1372
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:57,830
我尽心照顾珍妮特 努力让她开心
I took care of Jeannette, and I made her happy.

1373
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,790
我也曾像爱亲生儿子一样爱你
I also chose to love you as my own.

1374
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,370
其实我大可不必那么做
Now, I didn't have to do that.

1375
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,950
可是你还那么小 没有父亲
But you were this little kid, no father,

1376
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:07,750
眼里充满绝望 内心空虚无助
no hope in his eyes, a big hole in his heart,

1377
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,380
所以我给了你我能付出的全部
so I gave you everything I could.

1378
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:11,920
可是我不会再那么做了
But I'm done, you know?

1379
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,510
你不接受我的爱 可以
You don't want it, that's fine.

1380
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:17,010
我给你的最后忠告就是
My last word of advice to you is this...

1381
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,180
能成熟点吗
Will you grow up?

1382
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:22,730
不要再把自己的痛苦归罪于他人
Stop blaming everyone else for your pain.

1383
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:24,020
无论你做什么
And whatever you do,

1384
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,320
不要让你可爱的儿子觉得
don't teach that beautiful son of

1385
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:29,690
爱是有条件的 因为爱是无条件的
yours that love is conditional, because it is not.

1386
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,400
再见 格蕾丝
Good bye, Grace.

1387
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,080
再见 蓝蓝
Bye-bye, Blue.

1388
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,340
维克多爷爷
Grandpa Vicster.

1389
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:56,180
再见
Bye.

1390
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,560
再见 帕特里克•温斯洛
Goodbye, Patrick Winslow.

1391
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:14,440
看那大轮子
Look at that big wheel.

1392
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,320
来 跟我来 亲爱的
Come. Come along, my dear.

1393
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:20,700
这就是为什么巴黎被称为光明之城
So this is why they call it the City of Light.

1394
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:23,410
好多人啊
There's a lot of people.

1395
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,540
是啊 不过
Yes, well...

1396
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:28,880
我更喜欢叫他们"崇拜者"
I prefer to call them "Worshippers."

1397
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,380
"崇拜者"
"Worshippers."

1398
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:32,960
阿拉卡跪下
Alakakneel!

1399
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,130
弯腰 跪下
Bow. Kneel.

1400
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,430
汉库斯
Hackus.

1401
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:41,550
-走吧  -我们走
-Shall we? -Let's go.

1402
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,980
别担心 大家都喜欢这样 他是大明星 来吧
Don't worry. Everyone likes it. He's a celebrity. Come on.

1403
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:47,310
好吧
Okay.

1404
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:49,770
好哇 是我
Yes, hello. It's me.

1405
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,440
-这些是我的孩子们  -嗨
-These are my children. -Hi.

1406
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,110
-那是谁  -是我哥哥
-Who's that? -That's my brother.

1407
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:55,280
嗨 我是汉库斯
Hi. I'm Hackus.

1408
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,950
快看啊 多神奇的生物
Look at that. It's a magical creature.

1409
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,780
嗨
Hi.

1410
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:01,200
今天是我生日哦
It's my birthday.

1411
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:02,830
谢谢
Thank you.

1412
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:05,120
-我有免票特权  -对 免票特权
-I have a FASTPASS. -Yeah, FASTPASS.

1413
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,620
格格巫先生
Monsieur Gargamel!

1414
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:10,500
谢谢你们帮我们预热座位 再见啦
Thank you for keeping our seats warm. Goodbye.

1415
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:11,670
再见
Bye-bye!

1416
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:14,840
跟上 孩子们 这边来
Come along, children. Right this way.

1417
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:18,010
格格巫先生 格格巫先生
Monsieur Gargamel! Monsieur Gargamel!

1418
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:20,930
我们走
Let's go!

1419
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:22,260
-爸爸  -等会
-Father. -Not now.

1420
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:23,760
快到吃饭时间了
It's feeding time soon.

1421
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,770
-不是现在  -可是
-Not now! -But

1422
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,020
我们到了
Here we are.

1423
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:33,770
-好戏才刚刚开始  -耶
-Our fun is just beginning, eh? -Yeah.

1424
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:37,150
阿拉卡快动
Alakazelevate!

1425
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:45,580
很漂亮 不是吗 亲爱的
But isn't this lovely, my dear?

1426
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:47,830
想想看
And just think,

1427
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:52,290
你的配方加上我强大的魔法
with your secret formula and my incredible magic,

1428
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:56,380
天底下就没有我们做不到的事
there's absolutely nothing that we cannot do.

1429
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:59,300
是啊
Yeah.

1430
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:02,510
想象一下我们在一起有多欢乐吧 蓝妹妹
Think of all the fun we could have, Smurfette.

1431
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:09,270
好吧
Okay.

1432
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:12,810
那我们为什么还转得这么慢呢
Then why are we going so slow?

1433
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:37,810
{\a6}Vacation by G.R.L

1434
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,830
-当心  -耶
-Look out! -Yeah!

1435
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,500
多好玩啊
Isn't this fun?

1436
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:38,170
一点也不好玩
Decidedly not!

1437
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,270
真棒啊 蓝妹妹的开心游 哈
Best ride ever! Smurfette's fun, huh?

1438
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,490
来啦
Incoming!

1439
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:03,280
小心 过来啦
Look out! Coming through!

1440
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:07,740
不好意思啦
Sorry!

1441
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,140
我一定让她失望了
I must have failed her.

1442
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,810
对不起 我只是想找个地方静一静
Sorry. I was looking for a place to think.

1443
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:33,560
不 不 没关系
No, no, no, no. It's okay.

1444
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,310
我也正在反思我自己
I was doing a little thinking myself.

1445
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:42,940
温斯洛先生 这不容易开口
Master Winslow, it's hard for me,

1446
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:46,450
不过 你能给我一些建议吗
but, well, can I ask you some advice?

1447
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,490
作为一个父亲的建议
I mean, papa to Papa

1448
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,330
是关于蓝妹妹的
It's about Smurfette.

1449
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,830
我不知道该怎么办了
I don't know what to do.

1450
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,120
我把她变蓝
I turned her blue.

1451
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:59,000
教她爱与友善
I taught her love and kindness.

1452
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:02,000
但事实上 是格格巫制造了她
But the truth is, Gargamel made her.

1453
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:06,130
只要她愿意 她就是个蓝精灵
She's only a Smurf as long as she chooses to be.

1454
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,550
可如果她不愿意呢
But what if she doesn't?

1455
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:12,430
如果她选择了格格巫呢
What if she chooses him?

1456
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,680
我们会失去她
We could lose her.

1457
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,690
我们可能已经失去她了
We may have already.

1458
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,310
是我做得不够好
I haven't done enough.

1459
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,770
你开玩笑吧
Are you kidding?

1460
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:24,320
格格巫只是制造了她 可是你
Gargamel just made her, but you,

1461
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,780
你成就了她
you made her what she is.

1462
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:28,740
你无条件付出 视她如己出
You stepped in and loved her as your very own.

1463
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:31,030
没有人要求 可你还是那样做了
No one asked you to, you just did.

1464
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,620
因为你知道她需要那一切
Because you knew she needed that.

1465
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,830
那是...
And that's a...

1466
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:41,920
那是一种非常特殊的爱
That's a pretty special kind of love.

1467
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,720
她那么聪明 不可能感觉不到的
She's way too smart not to see that.

1468
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:50,970
你说得对
You're right.

1469
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:53,720
我们并不是因为她变蓝了才信任她
We didn't believe in her because she changed.

1470
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,180
她是因为我们的信任才变蓝的
She changed because we believed in her.

1471
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,650
谢谢你 温斯洛先生
Thank you, Master Winslow.

1472
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:03,070
这些正是我需要的
That was exactly what I needed to hear.

1473
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,410
也是我需要的
Me, too.

1474
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:17,290
再来点泡泡
Just a few more bubbles.

1475
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,920
这样如何
How's that?

1476
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,250
我的个天啊 你吃了什么啊
Sweet Smurf in Heaven, what have you eaten?

1477
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:25,760
没关系 每次蓝精灵排放尾气 都有人如释重负
It's okay. Every time a Smurf toots, someone smiles.

1478
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:28,010
-我们走 蓝精灵们  -去哪
-Let's go, Smurfs. -Where?

1479
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:29,260
去救蓝妹妹
We're getting Smurfette.

1480
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:31,180
可是你也看到她了 爸爸
But you saw her, Papa.

1481
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,180
她现在是格格巫的人了
She's one of them now.

1482

1484

1486
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:42,020
我不管我们看见什么
I don't care what we saw.

1487
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,440
我们永不放弃家人
You never give up on family.

1488
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,440
对 爸爸说得对

1489
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:48,820

温斯洛先生 和我们一起去吗
Master Winslow, you coming with us?

1493
01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:58,960
蓝精灵的屁股是蓝色的吗
Is a Smurf's butt blue?

1494
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,460
你自己看
You tell me.

1495
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,040

1496
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:07,050
-快提上裤子  -谁还想看

-We've got work to do. -Hey.

1499
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:13,140
打起精神 出发吧
Let's smurf this mushroom stand. Let's roll.

1500
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:15,390
好的 兄弟们 加油
Yeah, guys, let's do this.

1501
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,440
维克多 嘿
Victor? Hey.

1502
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:38,440
{\a6}Remember The Name by Fort Minor

1503
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,050
好的 温斯洛先生 我们分头行动
Okay, Master Winslow, we'll split up here.

1504
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:58,310
好的 我去找电控室把电源切断
All right. I'll find the electrical room and cut the power.

1505
01:13:58,510 --> 01:13:59,520
我们会找到蓝妹妹的
And we'll find Smurfette.

1506
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,680
而且我们干活时都帅极了
And we'll all look fabulous doing it.

1507
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:03,350
噢 行了吧
Oh, come on.

1508
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,400
团队建设 好吗
Team building. Hello!

1509
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:08,020
好啦 我们里面见 祝你好运
All right, see you inside. Good luck.

1510
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:10,030
-来吧 伙伴们  -钻入野兽腹中
-Come on, guys. -lnto the belly of the beast.

1511
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,660
为什么我们要下到这里呢 父亲
Why are we coming down here, Father?

1512
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:18,700
这个嘛 我们要为你失散已久的姐姐庆祝生日
Well, we are celebrating your long-lost sister's birthday.

1513
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:19,790
真的吗
Really?

1514
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:22,290
如果没有蛋糕的话
Can't very well end the festivities

1515
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:25,210
这个庆祝不能完美收官
without a cake.

1516
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:29,710
我做了你最喜欢的 亲爱的 蓝丝绒
I made you your favourite, my dear. Blue velvet.

1517
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:32,510
蛋糕啊
Cake.

1518
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:36,640
来吧 许个愿 亲爱的
Go ahead. Go ahead. Make a wish, my dear.

1519
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:41,270
你小小心中能梦想到的一切 都是你的
Anything your tiny little heart can dream of, and it is yours.

1520
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,060
任何事吗
Anything?

1521
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:44,440
当然
But of course.

1522
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:46,900
嗯 好吧 合理范围内
Yes, well, within reason.

1523
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:48,620
我担心我们这儿
I'm afraid we're on a bit

1524
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:51,230
精华不太够
of an essence budget around here lately.

1525
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,740
所以我们需要那个配方 你明白了吧
That's why we need the formula, you see.

1526
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:03,250
她在那
There she is.

1527
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:05,290
那是个生日蛋糕吗
Is that a birthday cake?

1528
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:07,250
我们也为她准备了生日蛋糕
We had a birthday cake for her, too.

1529
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,840
她只是没看到
She just never saw it.

1530
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,880
他们看起来真像幸福的一家
They look like a happy family.

1531
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,300
她不会把配方给他的 是吗 爸爸
She's not going to give him the formula, is she, Papa?

1532
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:18,970
如果她给了 那就意味着我们整个蓝精灵种族的灭亡
If she does, it would mean the end of all Smurf kind.

1533
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,680
等下 连帅哥也是吗
Wait. Even the handsome ones?

1534
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:24,770
-是的  -靓靓 你跟我来
-Yeah. -Vanity, you come with me.

1535
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:27,100
笨笨和厌厌 去跟温斯洛先生汇合
Clumsy and Grouchy, go meet Master Winslow.

1536
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:40,200
维克多 你来这干嘛
Victor, what are you doing here?

1537
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,410
格蕾丝给我打电话
Grace called me.

1538
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:43,620
她说你可能需要帮忙
She said you might need a hand.

1539
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,330
不 维克多 等下
No, no. Victor, wait.

1540
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,920
跟平常一样 格蕾丝是对的
As usual, Grace is right.

1541
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:53,920
我可能需要帮助
I could use some help.

1542
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:57,680
好的 首先 你最好试试去撬下水道盖子
Well, for starters, you might try lifting the sewer cover.

1543
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,180
除非你是准备修电话线
Unless you're planning on fixing the phone lines?

1544
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:06,980
蓝妹妹 配方呢
Smurfette, the formula?

1545
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:08,940
给你时间考虑 亲爱的
Take all the time you need, my dear.

1546
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,730
只是不要让我等太久
As long as it's very, very soon.

1547
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,730
然后我们就都可以变成蓝色了 一起
Then we can all be blue. Together.

1548
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:17,110
汉库斯蓝色的 汉库斯蓝色的
Hackus blue. Hackus blue.

1549
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:19,240
你看到了 他们想变成蓝色的
You see? They want to be blue,

1550
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,490
就像他们的姐姐一样
just like their big sister.

1551
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:24,660
然后我们就是真正的一家人了
Then we could be a real family.

1552
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,000
这很重要
This is something.

1553
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:35,380
是一个托付给我的神圣礼物
A sacred gift entrusted to me.

1554
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:39,840
对不起
I'm sorry.

1555
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:42,720
我只是 我...
I just, I...

1556
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:45,510
我不能
I can't.

1557
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:50,940
你是什么意思 你不能
What do you mean, you can't?

1558
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:52,350
我什么都给你了
I've given you everything.

1559
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,570
善心 礼物
Kindness, presents,

1560
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:57,780
没毒的蛋糕 这真可怕
a cake with no poison. It's been horrible!

1561
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:00,570
现在 我已经受够了 小姐
Now, I have had just about enough of this, young lady.

1562
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:03,450
你必须给我我想要的 现在
You are going to give me what I want right now!

1563
01:17:03,530 --> 01:17:04,870
-配方  -不
-The formula! -No!

1564
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:05,950
必须
Yes!

1565
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,370
-父亲  -干什么
-Father? -What, what, what?

1566
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:12,330
汉库斯头晕
Hackus dizzy.

1567
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:14,000
他们怎么了
What's happening to them?

1568
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:15,420
好晕啊
So dizzy.

1569
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,960
别跟我说你真在乎这些可怜的生物
Don't tell me you actually care for these pathetic creatures.

1570
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:20,300
你真可悲
How sad for you.

1571
01:17:22,050 --> 01:17:26,220
不过这刚好对我有利
And how absolutely perfect for me.

1572
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,970
电线好像是通往这边
It looks like the power lines run this way.

1573
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,810
走 快走 我们要把她救出来
Let's go! Let's go! We got to get her out of there!

1574
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:31,350
好的 行动吧
All right, let's do this!

1575
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,650
走这边 靓靓 穿过这个管道
This way, Vanity. Through this pipe.

1576
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:36,980
我们必须救她出来 这可是我大显身手的时候
We have to save her! This could be my moment!

1577
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:42,820
抱歉 亲爱的 我以为你知道
I'm so sorry, my dear. I thought you knew.

1578
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:46,240
没有精华 他们活不下去
Without essence, they cannot live.

1579
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:48,790
-父亲  -不
-Father. -No.

1580
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:50,120
求你了
Please.

1581
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,830
不 维可西
No. Vexy.

1582
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:57,500
好晕啊
So dizzy.

1583
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,300
-汉库斯  -蓝妹妹
-Hackus. -Smurfette.

1584
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,930
把你有的给他们 从我身上再拿点
Give them what you have! Take some from me.

1585
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,050
拿走
Take some!

1586
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:06,140
拜托了
Please!

1587
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,760
这有什么用 你又不给我配方
What's the point? You won't give me the formula,

1588
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:12,690
所以 好吧 我可能就管不了他们了
so, well, I might as well just let them go.

1589
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,140
维可西
Vexy

1590
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:18,270
你的意思是你会让他们死
You mean you'd let them die?

1591
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:21,280
我总能再做些其他的
I can always make others.

1592
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:25,200
而且 我不是那个让他们死的人
Besides, I am not the one letting them die.

1593
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:26,700
你才是
You are.

1594
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,080
好吧 好吧
Okay. Okay.

1595
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:34,370
我会把它给你 只要你喂他们
I'll give it to you. Just feed them.

1596
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:37,460
先给配方
The formula first.

1597
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:40,300
快喂他们
Feed them. Feed them!

1598
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:41,920
快点 我们必须进去这里
Quickly. We have to get in there.

1599
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:44,130
死路 这里上锁了
Dead end! It's locked!

1600
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:49,140
配方 啦啦啦啦啦啦
The formu-la-la-la-la-la-la.

1601
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,140
一个充满希望的想法
One hopeful thought.

1602
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:56,440
少许蜂王浆
A dab of royal jelly.

1603
01:18:57,860 --> 01:18:59,150
含羞草花粉
Mimosa pollen.

1604
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:00,270
蓝妹妹
Smurfette.

1605
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,610
-蓝妹妹  -真棒 好姑娘
-Smurfette! -Yes, good girl.

1606
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,740
我能听到他们 但是看不到
I can hear them, but I can't see them.

1607
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:06,950
等下 我知道了
Wait! I know.

1608
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:08,070
爸爸 看
Papa, look.

1609
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,700
-还有一滴貂油  -我知道这个
-And a drop of mink oil. -I knew it.

1610
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:12,080
她在给他配方吗
Is she giving him the formula?

1611
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,540
-噢 不  -蓝妹妹
-Oh, no. -Smurfette.

1612
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:14,660
帮我把这个打开
Help me get this open.

1613
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,790
然后你必须说一个爱的真理
And you must say one loving truth.

1614
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,170
-当然  -好了
-Of course. -There.

1615
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:22,420
这就是爸爸用过的魔咒
That's the formula Papa used.

1616
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,170
现在 喂他们 求你了
Now, feed them! Please!

1617
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:25,340
首先 我们得看看这个管用不 不是吗
First, we'll see if this works, huh?

1618
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:28,550
快点

-快来 喜喜  -我们来打败他们
-Come on, Positive. -Yeah, let's shut 'em down.

1624
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,610
一个爱的真理
One loving truth.

1625
01:19:43,690 --> 01:19:45,360
希望这个管用
I hope this works.

1630
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:42,580
汉库斯
Hackus.

1631
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:44,420
汉库斯变蓝了
Hackus is blue!

1632
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:47,010
我们变蓝了 我们变成蓝精灵了
We're blue! We're Smurfs!

1633
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:49,340
成功了 这个世界是我的了
It worked. All the world is mine!

1634
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,430
-我可以做自己的蓝精灵了  -不
-I can make my own Smurfs! -No!

1635
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:56,600
她背叛了我们
We've been betrayed.

1636
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:59,310
终于啊 终于啊
Finally, finally.

1637
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:01,270
你成了真正的男孩
You're a real boy.

1638

我变蓝了
I'm blue.

1639
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,440
现在你们都给我进机器里去
Now into the machine with all of you.

1640
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:05,690
父亲 不
Father, no.

1641
01:21:06,650 --> 01:21:10,610
-汉库斯不要笼子 汉库斯不要笼子  -行了 行了
-No cage for Hackus. No cage for Hackus. -All right, all right.

-进去吧  -汉库斯不要笼子

1645
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:21,330
我好像能够到那个插销
I think I can reach that pin.

1646
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:22,920
好主意 靓靓
Good idea, Vanity.

1647
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,380
加油 快点
Come on, come on.

1648
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:26,670
父亲 求你了
Father, please.

1649
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:28,260
现在 哪也不准去
Now, don't go anywhere.

1650
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:33,800
你的脸哭哭
You face leaking.

1651
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,310
汉库斯哭哭
Hackus leaking.

1652
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:41,230
汉库斯哭哭
Hackus leaking.

1653
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:46,110
你牺牲了一切只为救我们
You sacrificed everything just to save us.

1654
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:48,150
我必须这样做
I had to.

1655
01:21:48,730 --> 01:21:49,900
我在乎你们
I care about you.

1656
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,530
我们是一家人
We're family.

1657
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,910
不喜欢哭哭
No like leaking.

1658
01:21:56,990 --> 01:21:58,740
汉库斯喜欢蓝色
Hackus like blue.

1659
01:21:58,910 --> 01:22:01,080
多么令人作呕的一幕啊
What a sickening scene.

1660
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:03,830
我可能早就狂吐不止了
I'd be completely nauseated if this weren't

1661
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,920
可惜现在是我一生中最快乐的时刻
the happiest moment of my life!

1662
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:09,090
-试试那个控制杆 大的那个  -到我肩上来
-Try the lever, the big one. -Get on my shoulders.

1663
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:10,840
快点 小伙伴
Hurry, lads.

1664
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:11,970
往哪边扳
Which way do I go?

1665
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:13,970
试试负极 或许能关掉机器
Try negative. That might shut it off.

1666
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:16,890
{\a6}positive 可指积极自信也可指正极

1667
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:16,890
负极 呐 我现在只想要积极
Negative? Nah. I'm all about positive.

1668
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:21,230
好了
There.

1669
01:22:21,310 --> 01:22:25,270
巫师一小步
One small step for a wizard,

1670
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:28,360
一大步... 怎么了
one giant leap for... What?

1671
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:30,690
积极万岁
Positive!

1672
01:22:31,190 --> 01:22:33,320
蓝精灵莓子馅饼太多了
Too much smurf berry cobbler.

1673
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:34,610
厌厌
Grouchy!

1674
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:37,780
对了 我说了让你来按下按钮 是吧
Yes, I said you could press the button, didn't I?

1675
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,120
厌厌
Grouchy!

1676
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:44,370
我撒谎了 我的一大步
I lied. One giant leap for me!

1677
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:50,750
被炸熟了
Just got fried.

1678
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,220
想要对此积极起来有点难啊
Hard to put a positive spin on that.

1679
01:22:58,390 --> 01:22:59,560
狗精灵养的
Son of a Smurf!

1680
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:00,720
快点 靓靓
Hurry, Vanity.

1681
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:04,060
自恋就是为了今日的救赎
Narcissism is about to save the day.

1682
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:05,690
-搞定了  -太棒了 开工
-Got it! -Smurftastic: work.

1683
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:07,020
-我就知道  -快走
-I knew it. -Now go.

1684
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:08,560
-什么  -快走
-What? -Go!

1685
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:09,940
快点 阿兹猫
Come, Azrael!

1686
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:11,810
显然 我们得最后再
Apparently, we must harness

1687
01:23:11,810 --> 01:23:14,320
整治一下天空的能量
the power of the skies one final time.

1688
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,820
为什么这事儿弄得这么悲惨世界状
Why does this have to be so Les Miserables?

1689
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:18,450
-咱们走  -瞧瞧我 会使劲会摔跤
-Let's go. -Look at me, all rough-and-tumble.

1690
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:20,490
我是个突击蓝精灵
I'm like Commando Smurf.

1691
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:21,790
呼哈
Hooah!

1692
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:25,370
你说的对 突击队员都静悄悄鬼鬼祟祟的
You are right. Commandos are quiet and stealthy.

1693
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:26,960
呼哈
Hooah!

1694
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,500
-她在那儿  -蓝妹妹
-There she is! -Smurfette.

1695
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:30,840
圣诞老人
Santa!

1696
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:34,300
爸爸 你... 你来救我了
Papa? You... You came for me.

1697
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:37,720
我们当然会来救你 你是我的女儿
Well, of course we came for you. You're my daughter.

1698
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,600
难道有任何疑问吗
Was there ever a question?

1699
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,390
-不 这个锁上了  -快过去
-No, it's locked. -Go on through.

1700
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,680
-我们会找到别的路  -好
-We'll find another way. -Okay.

1701
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,230
咱们在里面碰面 温斯洛先生 快走
We'll see you in there, Master Winslow. Hurry!

1702
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:49,900

Hold this!

1704
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:09,880
爸爸
Papa.

1705
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,130
哦 我的宝贝
Oh, my dear.

1706
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:16,470
爸爸 我给了格格巫那个配方
Papa, I gave Gargamel the formula.

1707
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:18,220
但她救了我们的命
But she saved our lives.

1708
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:20,840
汉库斯活着 汉库斯活着
Hackus live! Hackus live!

1709
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:23,810
爸爸 我让你失望了
Papa, I let you down.

1710
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,060
我背叛了蓝精灵
I betrayed the Smurfs.

1711
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:28,640
对不起
I'm so sorry.

1712
01:24:28,850 --> 01:24:33,730
蓝妹妹 生命是最珍贵最值得保护的东西
Smurfette, life is the most precious thing to protect.

1713
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:35,900
我十分为你感到骄傲
I'm very proud of you.

1714
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:37,940
真... 真的吗
You... You are?

1715
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:41,030
真的吗 不打屁股吗 不扇巴掌吗
Seriously? No spanking? No smack to the knuckles?

1716
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:43,160
你就这样原谅她了
You forgive her, just like that?

1717
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:46,750
当然啊 我们给予的大量的爱会支撑我们
Of course. We rise to the amount of love we're shown,

1718
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:50,120
只有爱停止时 我们才会沉沦
and we sink only when that love stops.

1719
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:53,880
汉库斯又哭哭了 又哭哭了
Hackus leaking again. Leaking again!

1720
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:55,670
嘿 你找到了蓝妹妹
Hey, you found Smurfette!

1721
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:57,550
你好
Hello.

1722
01:24:58,590 --> 01:24:59,630
嗨
Hi.

1723
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:02,760
哦 不 我们没有时间了
Oh, no, we don't have much time.

1724
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:06,220
我们把配方找回来 然后赶紧逃 呼哈
Let's just get the formula back and get out of here. Hooah!

1725
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:07,930
等等 他们怎么办
Wait! What about them?

1726
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,060
他们怎么办 他们绑架了你
What about them? They kidnapped you.

1727
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:11,440
对啊 他们是格格巫的人
Yeah, they're Gargamel's.

1728
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:16,070
我也是 但爸爸从来没有放弃我
So was I, but Papa never gave up on me.

1729
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:18,530
所以我也不会放弃他们的
So I'm not about to give up on them.

1730
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:21,490
你还以为自己不是真正的蓝精灵呢
And you thought you weren't a real Smurf.

1731
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:24,370
-救他们出来 快点  -好的 爸爸
-Get them out, quickly. -Right, Papa.

1732
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:26,030
自由的汉库斯
Free Hackus!

1733
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,620
这样一共有七只了 对吧
And then there were seven, eh?

1734
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:31,160
你好啊 小猫咪
Hello, kitty.

1735
01:25:31,370 --> 01:25:33,880
欢迎来到我的宴会 蓝爸爸
Welcome to the party, Papa!

1736
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:37,840
看看这些蓝精华
Look at all this essence.

1737
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:43,640
我真喜欢看你们这个样子
I love your work. Really, all of you.

1738
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,560
特别是 你们现在痛不欲生的惨状
In particular, your Blue Period.

1739
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:50,060
我全身都扭曲了
My whole body is scrunching!

1740
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,480
你够了 格格巫
That's enough, Gargamel.

1741
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,980
你已经提取足够多了
You have enough.

1742
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:58,820
是的 是的 但你知道 蓝爸爸 我想要比足够更多
Yes, yes, but you see, Papa, I want more than enough!

1743
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:05,070
毕竟 我得给这个充电
After all, I have to be able to power this!

1744
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:10,160
我叫她 拉旺达
I call her La Wanda.

1745
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:13,540
懂了吧 因为这是根魔杖是吧
You get it? Because it's a wand.

1746
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,420
所以我叫它拉 很好笑就是了
So I called it La... It's very funny.

1747
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,250
你们现在是疼得要死
If you weren't in excruciating pain,

1748
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:19,340
不然你们一定笑尿了好吗
you'd be laughing hysterically, believe me.

1749
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:27,470
有了这些魔力 还有什么我做不了吗
Whatever will I do with all of this power?

1750
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:30,600
好 够了
That's right.

1751
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:34,020
我要统治全世界
I'm going to rule the entire world!

1752
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:35,600
不
No.

1753
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:37,520
对了 蓝爸爸
And, Papa,

1754
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:40,480
跟你说下我的第一步行动哈
I want you to know that as my first official act,

1755
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:43,330

way from Smurf Village right here to my Smurfalator,

1757
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:51,750
这样你就又能和你的蓝精灵小伙伴们在一起了
so you get to be with all of your little smurfy friends.

1758
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:55,370
一辈子在一起
Forever!

1759

想得美 格格巫
I don't think so, Gargamel.

Hurry, he's going for his wand.

Don't just stand there yelling at me! Attack!

1766
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:18,360

人家又要节食了
Thrown to the curb again.

-次次都来  -不好意思
-Every time! -Sorry.

1773
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:23,210
真的假的啊
Really?

1774
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,460
蓝精灵击掌
High fours!

1775
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,520
大家没事吧
Is everyone all right?

1776
01:28:36,730 --> 01:28:38,770
所有蓝精灵都没事
All smurfy and accounted for.

01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:48,110

你还好吗
Are you okay?

1788
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:07,880
这就是幸福的感觉吗
Is this what happy feels like?

1789
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,010
好啊 美女 我也很美的

你们大多数都知道 拉旺达
I think most of you know La Wanda...

1817
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:17,740

1821
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:34,630
旺达 拉旺达 不要啊
Wanda! No, La Wanda, no!

1822
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:37,510
这东西到底是要怎么关掉啊
Where is the "Off" Button on this thing?

1823
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:46,860
不要啊啊啊啊
No,no,no,no.

1824
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:48,730
不
No...

1825
01:30:54,030 --> 01:30:56,160
不要啊 拉旺达 不要就是不要啊
No, La Wanda! No means no!

1826
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:15,510
这真是 会疼死人的啊
This is really, really gonna hurt.

太棒了
That was amazing!

1829
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:28,230
呃 这样的话格格巫也就不闹腾了
Well, that takes care of Gargamel.

1830
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,150
回家吧 各位
Let's go home, everybody!

1831
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:31,360
-耶  -回家啦
-Yeah! -Home!

1832
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,990
我们还有一个小问题
We still have one small problem.

1833
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:35,820
我只剩五块晶石了
I've only got five crystals.

1834
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:39,570
我说 一个也不能少
Well, I say no Smurf left behind.

1835
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:42,700
哇 蓝妹妹
Wow, Smurfette.

1836
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:45,250
这魔杖你还用的真顺手哈
You are pretty good with that wand.

1837
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,670
貌似我天生就会这个
It's kind of in my blood.

1838
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:49,750
还挺困扰我的
Which used to concern me.

1839
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:52,750
但是一个伟大的圣人曾经告诉过我
But as someone wonderful once told me,

1840
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:55,170
你来自哪里并不重要
it doesn't matter where you came from.

1841
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:59,090
重要的是你想成为什么样的人
What matters is who you choose to be.

1842
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,180
真不愧是我女儿
That's my girl.

1843
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:03,430
你也是我们的好爸爸
And you're our papa.

1844

你将来也会是的
You'll be a good one, too.

1848
01:32:13,190 --> 01:32:14,610
我也会想你们的 蓝精灵们
I'm gonna miss you, Smurfs.

1849
01:32:14,690 --> 01:32:16,240
也许你可以用他们的名字命名一款你的玉米狗啊
Maybe you can name a corn dog after them.

1850
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:18,990
这才像话嘛 就用蓝玉米好了
Now you're talking. We could use blue corn.

1851
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,660
蓝精灵热狗 好好吃啊
Smurf dogs, yum!

1852

1866

1873
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:23,600
-你好  -我是贪贪啊
-Hi... -Hi, I'm Greedy.

1874
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:26,760
你好吗 我是贪贪 想跟我一起吃一个纸杯蛋糕吗
Hi, I'm Greedy. You want to share a cupcake?

1875
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:31,600
-哎呀  -这又是什么
-Crikey! -What the hey?

1876
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:32,900
差点吓坏
I nearly smurfed myself.

1877
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:34,360
汉库斯

1878
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,520
汉库斯 他们都是你的新兄弟

等一会哈
Hold on a minute.

1882
01:33:42,030 --> 01:33:43,280
严格意义上讲
Technically speaking,

1883
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,410
根据蓝精灵法典第六章
according to section six of

1884
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:46,120
中的基因配对学理论来讲
the Smurf Code of Genealogical Legitimacy...

1885
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,740
唉 直接踹他一脚得了

他是我们中的一份子
He's one of us.

1889
01:33:54,290 --> 01:33:58,050
经过漫长而又耐心的等待
And so, after waiting patiently to be relevant again,

1890
01:33:58,130 --> 01:34:02,380
我们伟大的念念终于回到他神圣的工作当中
our heroic Narrator steps back into his leading role

1891
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:04,260
我们上回书说到
to point out that when last we met,

1892
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:07,390
整个蓝精灵村忙着准备...
