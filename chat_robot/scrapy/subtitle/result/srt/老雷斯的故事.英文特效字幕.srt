{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's just say I need a tree.

99
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where would I go? What do I do?

100
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then you know what? You need to find the Once-ler.

101
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The what?

102
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mom, it's not really the

103
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}time for one of your magical fables, okay?

104
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's right, I forgot.

105
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm old and can't even remember to put my teeth in.

106
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stand down. That's not what I meant.

107
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, really, I forgot my teeth.

108
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Would you be a dear and go get them for me?

109
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sure, Mom.

110
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,360

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The Once-ler is the man who knows what happened to the trees.

112
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You want one, you need to find him.

113
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The Once-ler?

114
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay. Grammy, is this a real thing

115
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}that we're talking about now?

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, he's real all right.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, where can I find him?

118
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Far outside of town where the grass never grows

119
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and the wind smells slow and sour when it blows.

120
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And no birds ever sing, excepting old crows.

121
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Quit doing that.

122
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's the place where the Once-ler lives.

123
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wait, outside of town?

124
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}People used to say if you brought him 15 cents,

125
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}a nail

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and the shell of a great, great, great grandfather snail,

127
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}he would tell you everything.

128
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,430


129
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mr. O'Hare, what we've got for you

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}"How can I possibly make even more money?"

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Our research shows that if you put something in a plastic bottle,

00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}people will buy it.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}to make the plastic bottles,

153
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}the air quality is just going to get worse.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What?

166
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why is he leaving town?

167
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No one ever leaves town!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}See what he's up to.

169
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, man.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The boot?

195
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, that's me. The guy who still cares. I'm here.

196
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey! What?

197
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do you want to know about trees?

198
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}About what happened to them?

199
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why they're all gone? It's because of me.

200
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wait, what?

201
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's because of me!

202
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And my invention, the Thneed.

203
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It was an amazing product that could do the job of a thousand.

204
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right.

205
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sounds ridiculous, but I mean, that's cool.

206
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're darn right it was cool!

207
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It all started a long time ago.

208
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Can we start not so long ago, maybe?

209
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Do you want a tree?

210
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yes, yes.

211
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:56,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then it all started a long, long time ago.

212
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I was a young man leaving home.

213
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, here I go, Mom. Off to change the world with my Thneed.

214
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm actually doing it!

215
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yes, but just remember, Oncie,

216
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}if somehow your invention ends up a failure

217
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}instead of a success,

218
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}oh, it wouldn't surprise me at all!

219
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nice wheels.

220
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:22,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Burn!

221
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, "Burn!"

222
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But you will see, okay? I'm going to prove you all wrong.

223
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on, Melvin!

224
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, there I was at the very bottom.

225
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}With nothing but a wagon, a mule,

226
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and a completely irrational sense of optimism.

227
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I was searching the globe,

228
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}obsessed with finding the perfect material for my Thneed.

229
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But I'd had absolutely no success.

230
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Until one day, I found paradise.

231
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We're going to be there soon, I'm sure.

232
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This is the most beautiful place,

233
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}okay, I have ever seen.

234
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This is it

235
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This is the place

236
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}These Truffula trees are just what I need

237
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Gonna chop one down and make my Thneed

238
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But first...

239
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now you!

240
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's great!

241
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So now our friendship can begin

242
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hand in hand, and wing and fin

243
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There's nothing you and I can't do

244
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So let's all make my dreams come true

245
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, guys!

246
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on, where is my back-up chorus?

247
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What?

248
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, hey, wait. Wait a minute.

249
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Excuse me?

250
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, that's awesome.

251
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Feeding junk food to forest animals? That's great.

252
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But, uh, is there a musical number

253
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}where you show me how to get a tree?

254
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Because I would love to hear that one.

255
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, yes. Right after the musical number about the kid

256
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}who kept interrupting the story,

257
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and was never heard from again.

258
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Right, got it. Proceed.

259
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, here we go.

260
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}About to make a Thneed, about to change the world.

261
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Check it out, guys...

262
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where did everybody go?

263
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Little did I know that by chopping down that tree

264
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:28,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I had just summoned a mystical creature as old as time itself.

265
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The legendary, slightly annoying

266
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}guardian of the forest.

267
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The Lorax.

268
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Did you chop down this tree?

269
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No.

270
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Who did it?

271
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's that?

272
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I think he did it.

273
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Leave! Vacate the premises!

274
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Take your ax and get out!

275
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,060
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And who are you?

276
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm the Lorax! Guardian of the forest.

277
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I speak for the trees.

278
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So you're telling me, you just didn't see me

279
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}magically appear out of that stump?

280
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}With all the lightning and thunder and stuff.

281
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You didn't see any of that?

282
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, but that sounds amazing.

283
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Can I see some of that?

284
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh, yeah, I could show you. But that's not how it works.

285
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay.

286
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Didn't really happen.

287
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, I know what you want!

288
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:32,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I've got one of these for the cutest little guy I ever saw!

289
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy...

290
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How dare you! Give me that!

291
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm going to eat this,

292
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but I am highly offended by it.

293
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,910
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What are you... Hey, Mustache! Will you stop that?

294
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's your deal, man?

295
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Time for you to go, Beanpole!

296
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Pull them right out.

297
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just going to put them right back in.

298
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We can do this all day.

299
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Stop right there! Stop it!

300
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So you would hammer one of nature's innocent creatures?

301
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What? No!

302
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I would never hit this little guy. You, on the other hand,

303
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I would gladly pound you

304
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and your mustache into the ground!

305
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:30,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Behold! The intruder and his violent ways.

306
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Shame on you. For shame!

307
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, you know what? That's it!

308
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You listen to me, you furry meatloaf.

309
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm going to chop down as many trees as I need. Okay?

310
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Newsflash! Not going anywhere!

311
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}End of story.

312
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,890
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then you leave me no choice.

313
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If you're not gone by the time the sun sets on this valley,

314
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}all the forces of nature will be unleashed upon you

315
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and curse you until the end of your days!

316
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:09,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You have been warned.

317
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thanks. Yeah, okay.

318
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You have been warned.

319
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But I didn't listen to his warning.

320
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And you won't believe what happened that night.

321
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What?

322
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}If you want to hear more, come back tomorrow.

323
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, wait, wait! Tomorrow?

324
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Are you serious right now?

325
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ah! You live in the middle of nowhere!

326
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It stinks out here. Don't make me come back!

327
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I guess you don't really want to hear the rest of the story.

328
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, no.

329
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I do. I really do. I want to hear the story. I just...

330
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nah! You don't have what it takes.

331
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Goodbye.

332
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wait, wait! I have what it takes.

333
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's all right. It's okay, I'll come back.

334
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's no problem.

335
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}See, here I am, leaving. Walking away now.

336
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll see you tomorrow.

337
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Maybe. Just maybe.

338
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What did you wish for, Audrey?

339
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, I would love to tell you,

340
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:34,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but, sadly, according to the universal wish laws, I cannot.

341
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I know what she wished for.

342
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Was it, perhaps...

343
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This?

344
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ted, you didn't.

345
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, no. I totally did.

346
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Happy birthday, Audrey.

347
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Kiss him! Kiss him!

348
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ted.

349
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ted. Tedster.

350
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- You're kissing the cereal again, hon. - What?

351
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I just... I like this cereal.

352
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What one is this? Yeah!

353
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay.

354
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, I'll make sure to buy extra next time for you.

355
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, cool. Hey, I got to run. I got to go do a thing.

356
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,770
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, I'll see you guys.

357
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're not going anywhere, young man.

358
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's Sunday. You know what that means?

359
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Family time, and we're all playing board games!

360
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,370


361
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But...

362
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, man.

363
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mom, seriously, every turn?

364
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, back off!

365
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- No. - Okay! Family time is over.

366
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It is now personal time. I'll be in my room.

367
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, dear. Have fun.

368
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I knew I could break her.

369
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Go. - Huh?

370
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Go see him!

371
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah!

372
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You rule! Thank you, Grammy.

373
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,760
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey! Ted, right?

374
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mr. O'Hare?

375
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, I hear you have become interested in trees.

376
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What's that all about?

377
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where did you hear that?

378
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Teddy, there's not much that goes on in Thneedville

379
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}that I don't know about.

380
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Here's the deal, I make a living selling fresh air to people.

381
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Trees? They make it for free.

382
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:25,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, when I hear people talking about them

383
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I consider it kind of a threat to my business.

384
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't even know what you're talking about.

385
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You listen to me, boy.

386
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Don't go poking around in things you don't understand

387
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}or I'll be your worst nightmare.

388
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm Frankenstein's head on a spider's body!

389
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,560


390
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, my mom is expecting me. So, I'm just going to...

391
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Of course, of course. Now, go back to your family game time.

392
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Grandma just finished her turn.

393
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How did you know?

394
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Please. I have eyes everywhere.

395
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You got a beautiful town here, Ted.

396
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Lots of fun stuff to occupy your short attention span.

397
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why, I can't think of any reason

398
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:20,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}you would ever want to go outside of town again.

399
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ever.

400
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:31,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay! Good talk. Really good talk.

401
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,540
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

402
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look out!

403
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:06,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, man? You know, you need to change that door bell.

404
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Oh, you missed me. - What?

405
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:13,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're already back. Clearly, you missed me a little. Right?

406
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, I didn't. I'm just here to hear the end of the story.

407
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why are you so interested in trees anyway?

408
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Why aren't you like other kids

409
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}break dancing and wearing bell-bottoms,

410
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and playing the Donkey Kongs?

411
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,780


412
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, right, right. I don't know.

413
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Uh, I just thought it

414
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}would be kind of cool to have one, you know?

415
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's a girl, isn't it?

416
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What? No!

417
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,390
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Really? Because when a guy does something stupid once

418
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}well, that's because he's a guy.

419
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But if he does the same stupid thing twice

420
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}it's usually to impress some girl.

421
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, she is not some girl!

422
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}She's a woman, in high school.

423
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And she loves trees. And I'm going to get her one.

424
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:03,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}How nice to see someone so undeterred by things like reality.

425
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thank you.

426
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, but where did we leave off?

427
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now that's a Thneed.

428
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nothing unmanly about knitting. No, sir.

429
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look at that...

430
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Who taught you guys how to steal a bed?

431
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,800
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Shh!

432
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, nice and easy.

433
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nice work, you guys. Couldn't have done it without you.

434
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You got to be kidding me. Can he swim?

435
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Of course he can't swim!

436
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:50,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hang on, Pipsqueak! I'm coming to get you!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where did you go?

446
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Bar-ba-loots.

447
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, that's bad.

448
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,660

450
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey! We got trouble, and it's coming up fast!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We're in a river!

452
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, no.

453

456
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just a minute!

457
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,290

460
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I was heading into the light

461
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and you pulled me right back and here I am!

462
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You saved my life!

463
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, I know. Well, no, it's not that big a deal.

464
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It is a big deal!

465
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look, I almost went over that waterfall! Wait...

466
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:55,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}On my bed. How did my bed get in the river?

467
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:58,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}About that...

468
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:02,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Actually... I put your bed in the water.

469
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I didn't mean you any harm.

470
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I just wanted to calmly float you away.

471
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Look, everyone here needs the trees

472
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and you're chopping them down!

473
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, we've got a big problem.

474
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,480
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}All right, look.

475
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:28,980
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I hereby swear that I will never chop down another tree.

476
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,620
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I promise.

477
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thank you. But I'm going to keep my eye on you.

478
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Good. Now, I've got a big day tomorrow

479
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}so I'm going to get some sleep.

480
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Right after I find my bed.

481
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,140

00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:50,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Actually, no.

577
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:53,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But I think he's going to get to that part really soon.

578
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Here we are. - What?

579
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:58,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll just be a minute.

580
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, wow. Hey, Audrey!

581
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, hi, Ted! What's up?

582
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:09,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know me, just cruising. Putting out the vibe.

583
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just me and my thoughts.

584
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, is this the girl you're always talking about?

585
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Grandma! Stop making things up.

586
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:19,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- She's even prettier than... - Okay, got to run! Bye.

587
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, Grammy, let's get you home!

588
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:37,100


589
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:50,240


590
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm so sorry. So sorry.

591
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Did not wanna see that.

592
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, I'm back.

593
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What have you got there?

594
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,180
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yes!

595
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thank you, Ted.

596
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:47,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now, picture this.

597
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:53,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sun shining, a blue sky, a perfect day.

598
00:47:57,330 --> 00:48:00,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It was all downhill from there.

599
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,990
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What a dump.

600
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, Aunt Grizelda!

601
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, Chet, check this out!

602
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:41,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Go long!

603
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, Brett, that's actually not a...

604
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay.

605
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:46,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Go long! Go long!

606
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I got it! I got it!

607
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Got it!

608
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:55,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He totally ran into that tree!

609
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oncie, is that you?

610
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mom!

611
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There he is! There's my big, suddenly successful son!

612
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:11,400
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We always knew you would make it, Oncie. Right?

613
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:14,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey! I love this guy!

614
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But you always said I wouldn't amount to anything, remember?

615
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hush your mouth. I was just trying to motivate you!

616
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I am really glad that you clarified that

617
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:26,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}because it actually hurt my feelings for a really long time.

618
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,580
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Anyway, you're all here, you all work for me, and that's cool.

619
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, let's get to work.

620
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Brett, Chet, set up the RV!

621
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Would you stop throwing that bear?

622
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Time out. Back up. Stop. Don't move an inch.

623
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:10,740
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nobody's moving in here.

624
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You got to go. Goodbye.

625
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:15,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, who invited the giant, furry peanut?

626
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You calling me a peanut, huh?

627
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll go right up your nose!

628
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You wouldn't hit a woman.

629
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:24,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's a woman?

630
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:27,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay. Everyone, cool it.

631
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's not get off on the wrong foot here.

632
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:32,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Um, family, this is my friend... - Acquaintance.

633
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:36,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, acquaintance. Very good acquaintance, the Lorax.

634
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- He speaks for the trees. - That's right.

635
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:42,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And on behalf of the trees, get out!

636
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Will you just be nice! This is my family.

637
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,280
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And I'm going to need their help

638
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}if my company is going to get bigger. Okay?

639
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Bigger?

640
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:56,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, this isn't some rinky-dink operation anymore.

641
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I got plans. Big plans!

642
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:03,720
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}A vision of a world filled with Thneeds. It's going to be huge!

643
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Which way does a tree fall?

644
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:09,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}down?

645
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}A tree falls the way it leans.

646
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Be careful which way you lean.

647
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:28,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I mean, look at this. It's amazing.

648
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I am so proud of me.

649
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:35,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oncie, we've got us a little problem.

650
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,920
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Problem?

651
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}See, we're not making Thneeds fast enough.

652
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,010
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Harvesting the tufts takes too long!

653
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,930
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, what else can we do?

654
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:59,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, and this just came to me

655
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}we could always start chopping down the trees.

656
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What?

657
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Now you're thinking. That would speed things up!

658
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- But... - No "But" s, Oncie.

659
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You're running a business now.

660
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You have to do what's best for the company

661
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and your momma.

662
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, I guess it couldn't hurt to chop down a few trees.

663
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:24,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You've made me so proud, Oncie. Come here!

664
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:27,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey! I love this guy!

665
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No! No, no, no! Stop it! Please, stop.

666
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Take that, you stupid tree!

667
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:51,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Where do you think you're going?

668
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Excuse me, sir. I need to talk with your boss.

669
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:58,040
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm sorry

670
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:01,500
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but Mr. Once-ler's not seeing anyone right now.

00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:00,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and turning more Truffula trees into Thneeds.

771
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:04,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And nothing is going to stop me!

772
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,070
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, that's it.

773
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,290
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The very last one.

774
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:28,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That may stop you.

775
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,460


776
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,690
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Somebody sure made a bundle on that thing.

777
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:55,190
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I wonder what the next million dollar invention's going to be.

778
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:04,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, I wonder...

779
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:18,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Son, you have let me down.

780
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Brett, you are now my favorite child.

781
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, look, I don't want any trouble.

782
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And you won't get any. Not from them.

783
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Thanks to you and your hacking, and smogging and glupping,

784
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}they can't live here anymore.

785
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:02,810
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, I'm sending them off.

786
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:06,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hopefully, they'll be able to find a better place out there somewhere.

787
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Melvin?

788
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:14,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Melvin...

789
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:17,310
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Pipsqueak...

790
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:30,670


791
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:37,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, this is really all your fault.

792
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You destroyed everything.

793
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,440
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yes.

794
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:43,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And each day since the Lorax left,

795
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:47,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I've sat here regretting everything I've done,

796
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:51,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}staring at that word, "Unless,"

797
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:55,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and wondering what it meant.

798
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:57,330
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But now I'm thinking...

799
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:01,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Well, maybe you're the reason the Lorax left that word there.

800
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Me? Why would he leave that for me?

801
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Because unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot,

802
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}nothing is going to get better.

803
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:12,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's not.

804
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,450
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The last Truffula seed.

805
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:36,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You need to plant it, Ted.

806
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:40,460
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah, but, nobody cares about trees anymore.

807
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:41,950
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then make them care.

808
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:45,510
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Plant the seed in the middle of town, where everyone can see.

809
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:48,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Change the way things are.

810
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I know it may seem small and insignificant,

811
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:53,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}but it's not about what it is,

812
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}it's about what it can become.

813
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:57,100
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That's not just a seed,

814
01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:00,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}any more than you're just a boy.

815
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:09,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I won't let you down.

816
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,110
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I know.

817
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:56,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hey, Audrey!

818
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:58,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Audrey!

819
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ted?

820
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- What are you doing? - Meet me at my house.

821
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wait, but...

822
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:05,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My house, okay?

823
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,340
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Got to plant the seed.

824
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:11,970
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay, we're going to need water.

825
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:14,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And uh, something to dig with.

826
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:16,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- what do I have... - Ted?

827
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:18,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Mom, I'm busy, Mom.

828
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:20,350
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Theodore Wiggins, get down here right now,

829
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,430
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and I am not kidding with you!

830
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:31,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Ted, I would like you to meet Mr. O'Hare,

831
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}the most powerful man in town.

832
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}There he is!

833
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:38,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hello, Ted.

834
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:42,880
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}- Hi. - Isn't he clever, Mr. O'Hare?

835
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}He knows his own name and everything.

836
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:50,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You know what I would love right now, Mrs. Wiggins?

837
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,710
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}A delicious cookie.

838
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wonderful.

839
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,670
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Teddy and I'll stay here and talk.

840
01:04:57,770 --> 01:05:00,470
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Sure, why don't you go ahead and adopt him?

841
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:04,600
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm just kidding. That was a joke. I was just joking.

842
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:07,150
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'll get your cookie.

843
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I know you have it, Ted.

844
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:12,860
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So, let's put an end to this nonsense, shall we?

845
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:15,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Hand it over.

846
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:16,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm sorry...

847
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:19,240
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't know what you're talking about.

848
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Really? Well, then...

849
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:23,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I guess you wouldn't mind us checking your room.

850
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:24,960
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, no, no!

851
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:26,790
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Morty! McGurk! Find the seed!

852
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, you can't go up there!

853
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:29,830
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Guys, this is ridiculous. Stop!

854
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,840
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}No, you can't come in my room!

855
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:37,300
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Find it!

856
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:44,560
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Find it!

857
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}What is going on here?

858
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:50,520
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}This doesn't involve you! Get back downstairs!

859
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:51,940
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Excuse me, down there!

860
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:54,320
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I don't care who you are, you little crazy baby-man!

861
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:57,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Get out of my house now. This is outrageous.

862
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,200
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Fine. Sorry.

863
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,490
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Must have been a misunderstanding. We'll be leaving now.

864
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:06,370
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And my apologies, Ted.

865
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:10,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You be safe.

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Then these leaves, they just fall.

942
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:32,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}They just fall wherever they want!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}That boy has a seed.

953

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Yeah. I know.

964
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:03,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Wow. Did you see that?

965
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,870
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Who does this kid think he is, huh?

966
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I am Ted Wiggins.

967
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And I speak for the trees.

968
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:18,550
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And the fact is, things aren't perfect here in Thneedville.

969
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:20,220
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And they're only going to get worse,

970
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:22,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}unless we do something about it,

971
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:25,380
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}unless we change our ways.

972
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And we can start by planting this!

973
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:40,780
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Okay. Come on, now. Everything is fine.

974
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,730
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Right?

975
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:46,610
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I say we tell this kid what we think about that seed!

976
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:51,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}People, come on!

977
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:57,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You! Get out there right now

978
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:01,130
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}and get these people on my side, or else you're fired!

979
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:05,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Go on, tell them what you think.

980
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:12,680
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You don't know me, but my name's Cy

981
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:17,650
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm just the O'Hare delivery guy

982
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:22,030
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But it seems like trees might be worth a try

983
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:25,700
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So I say let it grow

984
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:30,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My name is Dan

985
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:31,410
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And my name's Rose

986
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:34,210
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Our son Wesley kind of glows

987
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:37,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And that's not good, so we suppose

988
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:39,090
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We should let it grow

989
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:41,630
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let it grow, let it grow

990
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You can't reap what you don't sow

991
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:47,050
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Plant a seed inside the earth

992
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:49,590
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Just one way to know its worth

993
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:52,230
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let's celebrate the world's rebirth

994
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,140
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}We say let it grow

995
01:16:54,230 --> 01:16:56,640
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My name's Marie, and I am three!

996
01:16:56,990 --> 01:16:59,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I would really like to see a tree

997
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,120
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I say let it grow

998
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:07,570
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I'm Grammy Norma I'm old, and I've got gray hair

999
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,160
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But I remember when trees were everywhere

1000
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:13,820
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And no one had to pay for air

1001
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,660
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}So I say let it grow

1002
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let it grow, let it grow

1003
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:21,420
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Like it did so long ago

1004
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:23,750
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It is just one tiny seed

1005
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:26,260
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}But it's all we really need

1006
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:29,020
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It's time to change the life we lead

1007
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,850
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Time to let it grow

1008
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:34,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}My name's O'Hare, I'm one of you

1009
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:39,270
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}I live here in Thneedville, too

1010
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:42,900
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}The things you say just might be true

1011
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:46,360
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}It could be time to start anew

1012
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:51,530
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}And maybe change my point of view

1013
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:55,080
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nah! I say let it die!

1014
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,250
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let it die, let it die

1015
01:17:57,510 --> 01:17:59,170
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let it shrivel up and...

1016
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:01,000
{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Come on, who's with me?

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Nobody.

1018

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}You greedy dirt-bag!

{\fnCambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\2c&HFFFFFF&\b0\i1}Let the love inside you show
