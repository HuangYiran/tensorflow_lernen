1
00:00:03,374 --> 00:00:05,358
这一定是古人守卫亚特兰蒂斯的
最后一道防线
It must be the Ancients last line of
defence before Atlantis

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,689
在古人最后的抵抗中被攻破了
Knocked out during the Ancients
last stand?

3
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:10,159
它的能源耗尽了
一万年可是一段很长的时间
It's power source is depleted. 10,000
years is a long time.

4
00:00:10,438 --> 00:00:14,195
有一艘不明飞船, 大小近似于幽灵的梭镖飞船
正向城市飞来
There's an unidentified craft, about the size
of a Wraith dart, heading for the city.

5
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:15,169
它在做什么?
What's it doing?

6
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:16,108
扫描我们
It's scanning us.

7
00:00:16,248 --> 00:00:16,943
那些是什么?
What are those?

8
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,544
幽灵的母船, 3艘
Wraith Hive ships. 3 of them.

9
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:22,023
如果保持方向和速度
两周后它们将会到达我们的星球
If they maintain direction and speed,they'll
be over our planet within two weeks.

10
00:00:24,249 --> 00:00:27,625
幽灵在你的祖先身上进行实验
The Wraith were conducting experiments
on your ancestors.

11
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:29,330
你有部分幽灵的DNA
You have some Wraith DNA

12
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:30,721
她能看到发生了什么么?
Can she see what's happening?

13
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:31,904
我在一艘飞船上
I am on a ship.

14
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:34,200
我在某种控制室中
I am in some sort of control room.

15
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,113
你们都是如此的可怜!
You are all so pathetic!

16
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:38,341
我觉得这不是Teyla在说话
Something tells me that's not
Teyla talking.

17
00:00:38,688 --> 00:00:42,029
有可能是Teyla将我们的
阿尔法站点的位置告诉给了幽灵
Then chances are it was Teyla who gave away
the location of our Alpha Site to the Wraith.

18
00:00:42,202 --> 00:00:45,437
它们知道亚特兰蒂斯是唯一通往
一个全新的, 富饶的取食场的通道
They know that Atlantis is the only way to
get to a new rich feeding ground.

19
00:00:45,994 --> 00:00:46,691
地球
Earth.

20
00:01:00,434 --> 00:01:03,529
除了Teyla之外, 我们现在都可以确定
幽灵更感兴趣的
Not only has Teyla been able to
ascertain that the Wraith

21
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:07,879
是地球, 而不是亚特兰蒂斯
你们知道, 这很恐怖
are more interested in Earth, than Atlantis,
which is, you know, terrifying.

22
00:01:08,017 --> 00:01:10,523
她知道了幽灵的母船会正好经过
She realised that the hive
ships will go right past

23
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:12,959
唯一幸存的Le Grandia卫星
the only surviving
Le Grandia point satellite

24
00:01:13,097 --> 00:01:16,890
我们可以想象
在那个硕果仅存的卫星所在的地方
The last of what we assume,
where dozens of defense satellites destroyed

25
00:01:17,028 --> 00:01:19,534
还有数十个防御卫星
在古人抵抗幽灵的战斗中被摧毁了
during the Ancients last stand
with the Wraith.

26
00:01:19,638 --> 00:01:20,542
是的, 是的, 是的
Yes, yes, yes.

27
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:22,839
现在的想法是, 我们可以利用这个卫星
The point is, we think
we can use it to our advantage.

28
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:23,987
我想你以前曾经说过它已经没有用了
I thought you said it was dead.

29
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,840
确实是, 不过我想如果我们搞清楚了
它是如何工作的, 还是可以把它修好的
It is, but we think we learned enough
about how it works, to bring it back.

30
00:01:26,944 --> 00:01:29,867
如果我们知道它到底出了什么问题
If we are right about what is wrong with it.

31
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:32,372
是的, 当然, 如果我们知道
它到底是出了什么问题
Yes of course if we're right about
what's wrong with it.

32
00:01:32,476 --> 00:01:37,660
但即便是我们是对的, 可是它却没有足够的能量
幽灵还是可以对它熟视无睹
But if we're right, and it's just out of power,
the Wraith have simply been ignoring it.

33
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,966
根据我们的初步估计
只用一台naquadah发电机
Our preliminary estimates indicate,
a single naquadah generator,

34
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:43,122
就足够可以让它继续工作
would be enough to bring it back online.

35
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:46,497
我们为什么不能用我们的发电机
让亚特兰蒂斯的武器系统工作起来呢?
Why can't we use our generators to get
the weapon systems of Atlantis working?

36
00:01:46,637 --> 00:01:50,777
因为这些系统本来是设计从
零点模块来提取能量的
Because those systems were designed
to be powered by the Zero Point Module,

37
00:01:50,847 --> 00:01:52,169
而卫星却不是
and the satellite isn't.

38
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:54,917
你的意思是, 你认为它还不够强大
足以干掉一艘幽灵的母船
You mean, you don't think it's powerful
enough to take out a Wraith hive ship.

39
00:01:54,987 --> 00:01:56,831
根据古人的数据库
当完全充满电时
Well, according to the Ancient database,
it should be able to

40
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,118
它应该能够干掉所有这三艘母船
take out all three,
when fully charged.

41
00:01:58,223 --> 00:02:00,483
请记住古人的科技比幽灵要远远先进
Keep in mind that the Ancient
technology was far superior.

42
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:03,163
他们输掉那场战争
仅仅是因为幽灵的数目太多了
They only lost the war
because they were vastly outnumbered.

43
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:04,728
对我们来说
幽灵同样也是占了数量上的优势
We're vastly outnumbered.

44
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:05,842
而且武器也比我们好
And outgunned.

45
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,773
但是它们还没有看到卫星的力量
But they don't see
the satellite as strength

46
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:11,826
用军方的说法
In military parlance?

47
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:15,096
出其不意, 是对我们有利的一个因素
Surprise, is an element on our side.

48
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:19,480
你需要什么?
What do you need?

49
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:21,915
乘坐我们的小飞船, 需要15小时
才能到达那颗卫星
The satellite is 15 hours away,
by Puddle Jumper.

50
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:24,107
我建议我们组织一个小分队
I recommend that we
put together a small crew.

51
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,787
包括我, Grodin和一个飞行员
Say myself,
Grodin and a pilot.

52
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:27,830
我会去
I'll go.

53
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:29,465
不用, 让Miller去就可以了
No, Miller can handle it.

54
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,840
少校, 我希望你继续搜索阿尔法站点
Major, I need you to keep searching
for alternate Alpha Sites,

55
00:02:33,014 --> 00:02:34,232
以防万一卫星也失败了
just in case this fails.

56
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:38,825
母船在49小时之后就会进入
卫星的攻击范围
The hive ships will be in range
of the satellite in forty nine hours.

57
00:02:38,963 --> 00:02:41,746
我们需要充分利用这其中的每一秒钟
We're gonna need every last second,
of that time.

58
00:02:41,886 --> 00:02:43,834
还有什么问题么?
Questions?

59
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:48,287
好吧, 我们开始干吧
Ok, let's get on it.

60
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,176
Rodney
Well Rodney.

61
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,942
我并不是想给你增加压力
不过此时此刻
Don't mean to put any undue pressure,
but at this moment,

62
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,100
那个卫星是唯一可以在幽灵和亚特兰蒂斯之间
起抵抗作用的东西了
that satellite is the only thing standing
between the Wraith and Atlantis.

63
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,222
不要压力过大
No undue pressure?

64
00:04:00,572 --> 00:04:06,581
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季第19集 围攻 第一部分
StarGate Atlantis
1x19 - The Siege

65
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:13,771
我没事
I'm fine

66
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,381
我看你有些太心急了
I'm looking for something
a little more enthusiastic, than fine.

67
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,781
我已经准备好回去执行任务了
I'm ready to be put back
on active duty.

68
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:20,590
我知道你是这样想的
不过...
I'm sure you think so,
but uh...

69
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,391
告诉他我没事
Tell him I'm fine.

70
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:22,503
她没说错, 少校
She is Major.

71
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:28,766
我觉得没有理由
再让她在这里接受医学监护了
I see no further reason she should be
kept here under medical supervision.

72
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,037
好吧, 你可以回去参加任务了
Alright, you're back on active duty.

73
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:42,787
我认为我自己可以处理这个!
I think I can handle this alone!

74
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:44,945
你没有别的事要去做的么?
Isn't there something better
you should be doing?

75
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,127
我认为我应该去
I think I should go.

76
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:47,066
是的, 我同意
Yes, I agree.

77
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:47,902
走吧!
Go!

78
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,398
我的意思是, 参加这次任务
I mean, on the mission.

79
00:04:49,537 --> 00:04:50,650
为什么?
Why?

80
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:53,295
是的, 你可能比我更了解那个卫星
Sure, you probably know a little bit
more about the satellite than I do.

81
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:54,094
你终于注意到这一点了?
Noticed that have you?

82
00:04:54,234 --> 00:04:55,973
但是你对这个城市的了解
要比我多得多
But you know a lot more about
the city than I do.

83
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:57,330
好吧, 我知道该如何取舍
Ok, I think I see where this is going now.

84
00:04:57,434 --> 00:05:00,322
不管是什么原因
如果那边发生了什么状况
For whatever reason,
if there is problem there,

85
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:01,993
那应该是我, 不是你
it should be me, not you.

86
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:03,384
那里不会有问题的
There's not going to be a problem.

87
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:05,401
- Rodney, 你不知道
- 如果....
Rodney, you don't know that.
If....

88
00:05:05,507 --> 00:05:08,394
如果我们无法修好它
我们就掉头回来
If it seems like we can't fix it,
we'll just turn around and come back.

89
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:10,307
现在我知道了
我在每个地方都是无价之宝...
Now I realise I am invaluable everywhere...

90
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:10,864
你知道么?
You know what?

91
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:11,560
当我没说!
Forget about it!

92
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:12,465
我收回刚才说的话
I take it back.

93
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,265
别!
No!

94
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:13,751
抱歉!
不要!
Sorry!
Nope!

95
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:16,083
你无法收回刚才所说的话, 因为你已经承认了
我比你更加聪明
You can't take it back, because you've just
admitted that I am smarter than you are.

96
00:05:16,223 --> 00:05:17,266
我并没有承认这一点!
I admitted no such thing!

97
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:19,388
你可能很难说出口
在你刚才强迫自己说那番话的时候
It was hard for you to say,
but the truth shone through,

98
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,745
所要表达的意思已经昭然若揭了
when you were compelled to speak.

99
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:23,145
你可真是一个卑鄙小人!
You are a miserable little man!

100
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:23,702
嗨, 嗨, 嗨!
Hey, hey, hey!

101
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:27,007
我们不要在这里浪费时间了, 啊哈?
Let's not ruin the moment here, huh?

102
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:36,401
好吧, 在我不在的时候
替我看好城市, 嗯?
Now, keep an eye on my city for me,
while I'm gone, hmmm?

103
00:05:37,062 --> 00:05:38,315
祝你好运
Good luck.

104
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:40,402
好的
好的!
Right.
Right!

105
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:48,196
MA5-393?
MA5-393?

106
00:05:48,335 --> 00:05:50,597
不, 我们只在晚上去过那里
No.
We've only been there at night.

107
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:54,980
在白天, 那里可是热得不得了
所以, 它不能在候选之列
It's ridiculously hot there during the day,
so no, not really an option.

108
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:58,077
如果我们选择的阿尔法站点
没有被幽灵做上标记
We wouldn't be having this problem
if the damn Alpha Site that we'd picked,

109
00:05:58,216 --> 00:05:59,503
那么这个就算不上是问题
hadn't been marked by
the Wraith.

110
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:01,417
它们真是令人心烦, 是不是?
They're a real pain in the ass,
aren't they?

111
00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:03,296
是的
Yes they are.

112
00:06:03,435 --> 00:06:05,731
M4H-212如何?
How about M4H-212?

113
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:07,297
有Genii的间谍在上面活动
Crawling with Genii spies.

114
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,071
你是确实知道这一点
You know that for a fact SGT?

115
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,775
还是只是你自己的主观臆想?
Or is your spidey sense just tingling.

116
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,863
这是事实, 长官!
It's a fact, sir!

117
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:16,516
找到一个
M1M-316
Here we go.
M1M-316.

118
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:21,631
Stackhouse 报告那里的环境很漂亮
而且根据他的队伍所能提供的信息
Stackhouse reported lush surroundings,
and as far as his team could tell,

119
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,266
看起来那里还无人居住
it seemed uninhabited.

120
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:24,866
我马上集合我的队伍, 去那里查看一下
I'll get my team together and check it out.

121
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:25,493
OK, 很好
Ok, good.

122
00:06:25,597 --> 00:06:27,615
记住, 少校
我们并不需要十全十美
Remember Major,
we don't need ideal.

123
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,320
我认为只要我们能够在那里居住就行了
I think we'd all settle for close.

124
00:06:29,424 --> 00:06:31,407
我就去!
I'm on it!

125
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,349
少校, Teyla会跟你一起去么?
Major, is Teyla coming with you?

126
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:41,775
问这个你不会是认真地吧?
You're not seriously asking that?

127
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:43,967
我认为这是个坏兆头, 长官
I think that's a bad call sir.

128
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,010
你又来了
Here we go again.

129
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:46,751
我想说的是
我们现在还不能完全了解
All I'm saying is,
we still don't fully understand

130
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:48,420
她与幽灵之间的联系
以我的建议
her connection to the Wraith,
and in my opinion,

131
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,265
我认为我们不应该
让她接触任何
I don't think we should expose
her to any information

132
00:06:50,403 --> 00:06:51,621
我们不希望幽灵知道的信息
we wouldn't want the Wraith to have.

133
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,404
至少来说, 我们撤退的地点
不能让她知道
Not the least of which,
is the location of our evac site.

134
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:55,658
Beckett已经检查过了
她完全健康
Doctor Beckett gave her
a clean bill of health.

135
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:56,631
我也很高兴听到这个, 长官
And that's good to hear sir,

136
00:06:56,736 --> 00:06:58,406
不过如果她不能控制
幽灵如何使用她的...
but if she can't control how
the Wraith use her...

137
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,136
你对那个并不了解
You don't know that.

138
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:00,702
这就对了, 我们不了解!
That's right, we don't!

139
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:02,685
她看到了所有幽灵所看到的东西
She saw everything they saw.

140
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,355
谁敢保证它们不能
在她身上做同样的事情呢?
Whose to say they can't
do the same with her.

141
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:05,329
看到我们所看到的东西
See what we see.

142
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:06,686
那样的话, 她就会危及到我们的安全
If she's been compromised in any way.

143
00:07:06,756 --> 00:07:09,156
她是我的队伍中的重要一员
不用说了!
She's an integral part
of my team, period!

144
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,697
你的故事结束了!
谈话到此为止!
End of story!
We're done!

145
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:20,115
这是根据我所获得的信息
所产生的模拟
This is a simulation
I've put together.

146
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:26,587
它展示了如果我们启动了自毁机制
整座城市将会如何被摧毁
It shows how the city will be destroyed
once we trigger the self destruct.

147
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:44,017
很高兴你认为我应该来看这个
So glad you felt I need to see this.

148
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:48,749
我曾经在想, 我的噩梦还不够生动
I was just thinking my nightmares
will be more vivid.

149
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:51,045
这还不够
It's not going to be enough.

150
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,786
什么?
What?

151
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,873
自毁计划
The self destruct plan.

152
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:58,004
距离有效实施, 还差得很远
It's nowhere near effective enough.

153
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:00,683
现在对我来说, 已经相当有效了
Now that seemed pretty
effective to me.

154
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:02,596
亚特兰蒂斯不仅仅是一座城市
Atlantis is more than just a city.

155
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:04,475
它是一艘宇宙飞船
It is an intergalactic space craft.

156
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:05,136
是么?
Yes?

157
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:08,929
是的, Teyla说过, 幽灵的兴趣
并不在于摧毁亚特兰蒂斯
Yes well, Teyla said the Wraith are not
interested in destroying Atlantis.

158
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:11,433
他们到这里来是为了去地球
They're coming here to get to Earth.

159
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:13,347
它们只有通过星际之门才能做到这一点
They can only do that by going
through the Stargate.

160
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:14,530
这就意味着要劫持这座城市
Which means stealing the city,

161
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:16,374
这也就是为什么
我们要在这里装上自毁装置
which is why we have
a self destruct in place.

162
00:08:16,513 --> 00:08:19,853
是的, 不过,
如果还有一小块东西可以利用
Yes, but, if they are even
the least bit resourceful,

163
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:22,185
我必须做这个假设
which I must assume that they are,

164
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:26,394
它们就可以根据海床上的残骸
很容易的重新设计
they can easily reverse engineer
their own intergalactic engine,

165
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,864
它们自己的星际发动机
from the wreckage on the sea bottom.

166
00:08:29,003 --> 00:08:30,361
这就是说我们要让爆炸更猛烈一些?
So we need a bigger bang?

167
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:31,473
把它炸成更小的碎片
Break it into smaller pieces.

168
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:34,466
是的, 那可能会有帮助
Yes well, that would certainly help.

169
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,180
不过我更担心的是古人的数据库
But I'm more concerned about
Ancient database.

170
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:39,510
它备份数据的能力
It's ability to back up data.

171
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,285
它的冗余度非常高
It's incredibly redundant.

172
00:08:41,424 --> 00:08:42,503
冗余度很高?
Incredibly redundant

173
00:08:42,642 --> 00:08:44,277
这些记录都很老了
That record's old.

174
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:51,514
不过认真地说, 假如幽灵恢复了
古人的数据库中哪怕是极小的一部分呢?
But seriously, if the Wraith recover even
the smallest part of the Ancient database?

175
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:54,506
事实上, 这就是我所担心的
That is my concern, exactly.

176
00:08:55,028 --> 00:08:58,993
好吧, 完全摧毁掉数据库
到底有多困难?
Alright, how hard will it be to destroy
all the database terminals?

177
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,081
难以置信的困难
Impossibly hard.

178
00:09:02,473 --> 00:09:06,822
我们必须找到一种方法来
删掉古人的数据据库
We need to figure out
a way to delete the Ancient database.

179
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:08,631
好啊, 我们可以做到么?
Well, can you do that?

180
00:09:08,735 --> 00:09:10,545
我可以找到
I can find out.

181
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,563
好吧, 找到它
不过在你擦去所有东西之前
Ok, find out, but before
you wipe anything out,

182
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:13,954
我们必须考虑....
we're gonna have to consider....

183
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:15,555
Weir博士!
Dr Weir!

184
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:16,947
什么事?
Yes?

185
00:09:17,085 --> 00:09:19,139
我们收到了一个计划外的外星连接
We have an unscheduled
offworld activation.

186
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,957
Sheppard少校正受到攻击!
Major Sheppard is coming in hot!

187
00:09:25,922 --> 00:09:26,479
发生了什么?
What's going on?

188
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:28,220
他们遭受到了某种攻击
They ran into some
sort of resistance.

189
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:29,332
我想是幽灵
I'm thinking Wraith.

190
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:30,063
幽灵?
Wraith?

191
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,455
你以前不是说过那个星球无人居住么
I thought you said this planet
was uninhabited.

192
00:09:31,594 --> 00:09:33,543
确实是!
It was!

193
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:41,510
我告诉过你不应该带上她, 长官
I told you she was
a liability sir.

194
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:44,954
现在, 我不会再允许让你的个人感情
给我们带来其它危险了
Now, I'm not gonna let your personal feelings
endanger this facility, any longer.

195
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:45,789
什么?
What?

196
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:47,877
听着, 我并不是在指责你是
有意这样去做的
Look, I'm not accusing
you of doing it intentionally,

197
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:49,964
不过幽灵一定可以从你那里获取信息
but the Wraith must be getting
information from you.

198
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:51,147
你到底在说些什么?
What the hell are you talking about?

199
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:53,582
我们进入了一个....
那到底是什么?
We ran into a....
What the hell was that?

200
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:54,939
看起来是一个很像T-Rex的恶心的家伙, 长官
(T-Rex是一种恐龙的名字)
It looked an awful lot like
a T-Rex, sir.

201
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:56,122
是的
T-Rex
Yeah.
T-Rex.

202
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:59,497
根本就不是幽灵
所以你根本就没有理由来指责
It wasn't even a Wraith,
so why don't you check those accusations.

203
00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:02,002
我认为你并不推荐
把那个星球作为阿尔法站点, 少校
I take it you don't recommend
the planet as an Alpha Site, Major.

204
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:04,785
它不会是我的第一选择
It wouldn't be my first choice.

205
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,900
如果McKay不能搞好那个卫星
我们就玩完了
If McKay doesn't get the satellite online,
we're screwed.

206
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:16,579
Weir博士, 我是Miller
我们正在接近那颗卫星
Doctor Weir, this is Miller.
We're approaching the satellite.

207
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:21,415
你们在这个太阳系的另外一侧
中尉, 你们一定要当心
You're on the other side of the solar system,
Lt. You guys be careful out there.

208
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:23,503
明白
Understood

209
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,679
OK, 关上隔离门
OK, close the bulkhead doors.

210
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:33,175
祝你好运
Good luck.

211
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:34,045
Right.
Right.

212
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:36,132
祝你好运
Good luck.

213
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:52,554
Bates军士!
SGT Bates!

214
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:54,920
什么事?
What is it?

215
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:57,147
你刚才指责我将我们的位置
报告给了幽灵
You just accused me of disclosing
our position to the Wraith.

216
00:10:57,217 --> 00:10:59,234
是的!
Yes I did!

217
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:00,417
很明显你错了
Clearly you were wrong.

218
00:11:00,521 --> 00:11:02,192
这仍然需要证实, 女士
That's yet to be determined ma'am.

219
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,097
抱歉?
Excuse me?

220
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:07,897
听着, 我情愿相信你不能完全控制
你所泄漏出去的那些信息
Look. I'm willing to accept that you're not fully
in control of what information you give away,

221
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:10,333
不过我仍然认为
but it's still my opinion that
you should not be

222
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:13,116
你不应被允许在这个基地自由走动
allowed to move freely around
this base of operations.

223
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,109
也许你并不是十分清楚
不过被指责为幽灵服务
Perhaps you are not aware SGT,
but being accused of serving

224
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:18,648
在我的人民当中是最大的侮辱
the Wraith is the greatest insult
among my people.

225
00:11:18,787 --> 00:11:20,631
噢, 我清楚
Oh I'm aware.

226
00:11:20,735 --> 00:11:22,893
到底发生什么了?
What the hell's going on?

227
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:25,050
我只是想表明一个观点, 少校!
I was simply stating an opinion, Major!

228
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:26,059
她袭击我!
She attacked me!

229
00:11:26,198 --> 00:11:26,929
以一个很正当的理由!!
And for good reason!!

230
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:28,251
好啊, 那到底是什么理由啊?
Yeah, and what reason would that be?

231
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,025
我想可能是幽灵吧!
My guess would be the Wraith!

232
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:30,930
滚开, Bates
Walk away Bates.

233
00:11:31,068 --> 00:11:31,591
长官!
Sir!

234
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:33,678
滚开!
Walk away!

235
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:36,079
这还没完!
This isn't over!

236
00:11:36,218 --> 00:11:39,001
如果是, 那才令人失望呢
I would be disappointed if it were.

237
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:40,428
你到底在干什么?
What the hell are you doing?

238
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,932
你并没有去检查安全领班!
You don't go around decking
the head of security!

239
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:43,455
他说....
He said....

240
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:48,047
我不管他说了些什么!
他说了很多东西
I don't care what he said!
He say's a lot of things.

241
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:50,517
你最好离他远一点
You just stay away from him.

242
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,599
你还好吧?
Are you ok?

243
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:36,721
是的, 怎么了?
Yes, why?

244
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,634
你的呼吸非常沉重
You're breathing pretty heavily.

245
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:41,488
是的, 我只是对这个狭小的地方有些不适应
Yes well, I feel a little claustrophobic.

246
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,584
这些东西里面有多少空气?
How much air do these things hold,
anyways?

247
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:45,593
八个小时
Eight hours.

248
00:12:45,663 --> 00:12:49,664
那足够了, 是吧?
我的意思是, 即便是沉重的呼吸的话
Well that's enough, right?
I mean, even with heavy breathing.

249
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,098
他们把那也算进去了, 是不是?
They would calculate that in, right?

250
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,456
你不会有事的
You're going to be fine.

251
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:56,205
是的, 你说起来容易
Yeah, it's easy for you to say.

252
00:12:56,343 --> 00:13:01,562
你并不用担心
自己只能呼吸八个小时
You're not the one with
the eight hour ceiling of breathing.

253
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:42,198
它已经完全死掉了
It's completely dead.

254
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:43,695
是的, 我们已经考虑到了
Well, we thought as much.

255
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:47,696
我准备接上naquadah发电机
I'm gonna hook up the naquadah generator.

256
00:13:48,184 --> 00:13:51,836
看看能不能让一些
生命支持系统工作起来
See if I can get some life
support going.

257
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,147
Halling, 你好
Halling, hello.

258
00:14:15,286 --> 00:14:16,921
我们可以说几句么?
May we speak?

259
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,695
当然, 请坐吧
Please, have a seat.

260
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:22,801
大陆上的撤退工作准备得怎么样了?
How is the evacuation
on the mainland coming?

261
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:25,585
我们会准备好的
We'll be ready.

262
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:27,672
很好
Good.

263
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,109
Weir博士, 我们听到有人说
你们准备摧毁亚特兰蒂斯?
Dr Weir, word is there
is a plan in place to destroy Atlantis.

264
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:40,232
我们有些顾虑
There are concerns.

265
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:44,581
如果这个城市仍然完好的话
幽灵就可以通过它去地球
The Wraith would be able to make it
to Earth if the city is left intact.

266
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:49,208
不过我想你保证, 这只是我们在
最坏的情况下的打算
But I assure you, that plan would only
be executed in a worst case scenario.

267
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:53,626
比如三艘幽灵的母船
向亚特兰蒂斯飞来?
Such as three hive ships flying
towards Atlantis?

268
00:14:54,323 --> 00:14:57,176
我们相信我们可以在他们到达之前
摧毁它们
We do believe we'll be able to
destroy them before they arrive.

269
00:14:57,314 --> 00:15:01,419
我理解你很担心你的人民
I understand you fearing for the
well being of your people,

270
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,700
不过这并不是摧毁祖先城市的理由
but it is not reason to destroy
the city of the ancestors.

271
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,578
亚特兰蒂斯是一个神圣的地方
Atlantis is a sacred place.

272
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:11,962
如果只是为了保存你们自己
就想到摧毁它的话....
To even consider destroying it,
merely for self preservation....

273
00:15:12,101 --> 00:15:13,632
只是为了保存自己?
Merely for self preservation?

274
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:18,398
这个地方是那个曾经存在于多个星球的
最伟大的种族唯一所剩下的东西
This place is all that remains of the greatest
race ever to inhabit the stars.

275
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:20,973
你更想让它落入幽灵之手么?
And you would prefer it fell into
the hands of the Wraith?

276
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:26,018
我相信祖先们不会让这发生的
I would have faith that the ancestors
would not allow it to happen.

277
00:15:26,122 --> 00:15:31,201
他们已经让亚特兰蒂斯保存了亿万年
你认为这没有可能么?
They have been able to preserve Atlantis
for 10,000 years. Is it not possible?

278
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,324
是的, 我认为这是不可能的
No, I don't think it is possible.

279
00:15:33,463 --> 00:15:37,534
如果你在设想古人会及时回来
拯救他们的城市, 我认为这是不可能的
Not if you're suggesting the Ancients
will return in time to save their city.

280
00:15:37,673 --> 00:15:40,978
你并不知道他们关于亚特兰蒂斯的计划
You cannot know their plans for Atlantis.

281
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:45,292
他们已经做好了他们所能够做出的
所有的计划
They have made all the plans
they are going to make.

282
00:15:45,431 --> 00:15:46,858
现在轮到我们了
Now it's up to us.

283
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:51,868
我很感谢你的想法, Halling,
不过我会尽一切可能
I thank you for your thoughts Halling,
but I have to do everything

284
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:56,113
来保证亚特兰蒂斯的能量和技术
I can to make sure the power
and technology of Atlantis,

285
00:15:56,217 --> 00:15:59,383
不会落入幽灵之手
does not fall into the hands
of the Wraith,

286
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,279
并保证它们不会进入我的星系
and yes, to ensure they never make
it to my galaxy.

287
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:07,942
即便这意味着要牺牲这里的未来?
Even if it means sacrificing
the future of this one?

288
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:20,432
你知道
想法非常简单
You know,
the idea is simple enough.

289
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:23,459
执行起来确是非常困难
The execution is proving
to be very difficult.

290
00:16:23,563 --> 00:16:24,260
制作病毒?
Creating the virus?

291
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:26,103
基本上说, 是这样
Essentially, yes.

292
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:30,139
一个古老而简单的计算机病毒
一旦被引入这个系统
A plain old computer virus,
once introduced into the system,

293
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:31,913
就会把数据库擦得干干净净
wiped the database clean.

294
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:36,158
它可以作为自毁机制倒计时程序的
一部分而被下载
It could be downloaded
as part of the self destruct countdown.

295
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:40,716
甚至还有可能影响幽灵的系统
如果它们试图访问的话
Might even affect the Wraiths systems
if they tried to access it.

296
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,151
我们可以保留下多少?
How much of it can we save?

297
00:16:43,256 --> 00:16:43,917
抱歉?
I'm sorry?

298
00:16:44,055 --> 00:16:45,065
数据库中的信息
Of the database.

299
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:47,326
我们带来了很多硬盘
Now we brought a lot of hard drives with us.

300
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:49,553
我们可以转移多少到我们的计算机上?
How much can we transfer
to our computers?

301
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:52,371
你的意思是像, 备份?
我们带走一个备份?
You mean like, back it up?
Take a copy with us?

302
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,458
是的, 是这样
Yes, exactly.

303
00:16:55,815 --> 00:17:02,252
采用McKay的压缩算法
我可以说, 可能7%, 或许8%
Using McKay's compression code,
I'd say, maybe 7, maybe 8%.

304
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,330
就这些?
That's it?

305
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,383
是的
Yes.

306
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:16,690
好了!
Here we go!

307
00:17:24,936 --> 00:17:26,919
主电源启动
Primary power online.

308
00:17:35,652 --> 00:17:41,914
看起来生命支持系统现在已经是100%了
我认为我找到了启动重力的开关了
Looks like life supports now at 100%.
I think I found the switch to initialise the gravity.

309
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,324
很好, 给我一小会儿时间....
Great, just give me a second to....

310
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,221
噢, 好, 好的!
我的后背看起来是永久性的损伤了
Oh yep. Yep!
That's permanent back damage.

311
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:56,701
我很抱歉, 我本以为没有这么快的
I'm sorry, I assumed it would come
on more slowly.

312
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,414
你的假设差点要了我的命
Well you assumed with my life.

313
00:18:00,702 --> 00:18:02,476
你会没事的, 这只是一个小碰撞
You'll be fine, it was just a little bump.

314
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,564
如果换成是你呢?
What have you got?

315
00:18:08,112 --> 00:18:12,287
看起来每个系统都重新运作起来了
除了武器系统
Looks like every system is back online,
except for the weapon.

316
00:18:12,427 --> 00:18:14,966
详细信息
我们开始工作吧
Details.
Let's get to work.

317
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,090
谢谢, 谢谢!
Thankyou.
Thankyou!

318
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:32,258
是脊柱的损伤, 我记得这种疼痛
Oh, yeah. That's vertabrae damage.
I recognise the pain.

319
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,606
M1K-439怎样?
How about M1K-439?

320
00:18:36,712 --> 00:18:38,033
那是什么?
Which one's that?

321
00:18:38,103 --> 00:18:40,434
到处都是瀑布的那个?
The one with all the waterfalls?

322
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:41,825
瀑布
The waterfalls.

323
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:46,557
瞧, 我们为什么不叫它
瀑布行星?
See now, why don't we just
call it Planet Waterfall?

324
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:50,385
什么?
我说我们应该为它们命名
What?
I say we should just give them names.

325
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:54,212
我们现在已经列出了五个行星了
Look, we've got a list
of five planets here.

326
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:56,483
可以让Stackhouse和他的队伍
出发去检查一下了
That should be enough potential Alpha Sites
to get Stackhouse and his team started.

327
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:59,483
<i>(广播)<i>少校, 一号发电机出现了一些情况
What's up.

328
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:05,693
发生什么了
It's Bates sir.

329
00:19:05,831 --> 00:19:06,284
是Bates, 长官
What about him?

330
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:08,875
- 他怎么了?
- 他被袭击了
He's been attacked.

331
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:12,164
叫一支医疗队到这里来
Get a medical team down here.

332
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:26,464
他会没事么?
Is he gonna be ok?

333
00:19:26,602 --> 00:19:28,099
还很难说
It's still hard to tell.

334
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:30,534
他断了五根肋骨, 和一根锁骨
He's got five broken ribs,
a fractured collarbone,

335
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:32,309
而且脑震荡也非常厉害
and the concussion was quite severe.

336
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:33,387
什么时候可以跟他说话?
When can we talk to him?

337
00:19:33,526 --> 00:19:36,101
不行
我用药物把他维持在昏迷状态
We can't.
I put him in a medically induced coma,

338
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,745
直到脑膜下的血肿可以被处理
until the subdural haematoma
can be deal't with.

339
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:41,667
现阶段, 我们还无法知道
在他身上到底发生了什么
We won't be finding what happened
from him, anytime soon.

340
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:44,242
Teyla和Bates昨天搞得非常僵, 长官
Teyla and Bates got into
it pretty bad yesterday sir.

341
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:47,199
殴打成这样, 就是另外一回事了, Ford
A fistfight and a beating like this,
are a long drive apart, Ford.

342
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,600
我知道, 长官
不过他们确实打过架
I understand that sir,
but they were in a fight

343
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:51,826
而且他们都不愿意停止
and they were both looking
to continue it.

344
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:54,088
有没有迹象证明是谁做的?
Anything pointing
to who did this?

345
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:57,428
我正准备检查他的身体和衣服
马上就开始
I'm having a forensic exam of both
his body and clothing, performed right now.

346
00:19:57,568 --> 00:20:03,308
如果找到了马上告诉我们
让我们去听听她会怎么说
Let us know what you find out.
Let's go get her side of the story.

347
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:15,416
这不是发电机的问题
Well, it's not a power
generation problem.

348
00:20:15,554 --> 00:20:17,956
naquadah产出的能量已经绰绰有余了
The naquadah's pumping
out more than enough juice.

349
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:20,043
那为什么它不启动呢?
Well then why isn't it?

350
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:27,253
好吧, 让我们从头开始, 好好想想
Ok, alright. Let's just step back
here and think about it.

351
00:20:27,488 --> 00:20:30,925
这个家伙是一个定向能量波武器
This baby is a directed energy
beam weapon.

352
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:33,925
由相对较低的能源
如我们的naquadah发电机, 充电
然后一下子释放出来
Runs off a relatively low yield charge,
like our naquadah generator,

353
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:38,960
这就是说它必须通过某种缓冲器
或者是一个电容器, 持续充电
so that means it's gotta be continually
building up a charge

354
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,960
直到被放电为止
with some kind of a buffer,
or a capacitor, until it's discharged.

355
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:44,292
我认为我找到了某种类似的东西
I think I found something like that.

356
00:20:47,842 --> 00:20:51,286
是的, 就是它
现在缓冲器的水平是90%
Yes, here it is.
Right now the buffer's at 90%.

357
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,705
Ok. 这么说电能是流到了缓冲器中了
而不是直接流到世纪的武器中
Ok. So power's getting to the buffer,
it's just not getting to the actual weapon.

358
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:59,427
让我看看能不找到某种诊断程序
Let me see if I can find
a diagnostics programme.

359
00:20:59,532 --> 00:21:00,992
这里一定有
There must be one here.

360
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:03,985
Ok, 我们还剩下29小时
Ok, we got 29 hours till showtime,

361
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:08,160
因此希望我们不要回去拿东西, 嗯?
so let's hope we don't have to
order parts, huh?

362
00:21:08,264 --> 00:21:10,317
你并不认为我跟这有关?
You do not think
I had anything to do with it?

363
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:11,326
当然不
Of course not.

364
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:13,413
你和Bates昨天确实处得很糟
You and Bates did get into
it pretty good yesterday.

365
00:21:13,483 --> 00:21:16,092
你了解我, Aiden
我从来不会做得那么过分的
You know me, Aiden.
I never would have taken it that far.

366
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:21,763
我知道, 所以让我们看看
我们能不能一起把这件事搞清楚
I know, so let's just see if
we can't rule it out, altogether.

367
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,043
你昨天晚上在哪里?
Where were you last night?

368
00:21:26,147 --> 00:21:28,130
我在这里, 我的房间中
I was here in my room

369
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:29,174
整个晚上都是?
The whole night?

370
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:30,079
是的
Yes

371
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:32,515
这么说没有办法知道你是不是出去了
So there's no way of knowing whether
you blacked out or not.

372
00:21:32,653 --> 00:21:35,436
我没有办法证明, 是的!
I have no way of proving it, no!

373
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:41,247
不过昨天晚上我没有离开这个房间
我保证
But I did not leave this room last night,
I am sure of it.

374
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:44,761
我没有离开这个房间
I did not leave this room

375
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:48,727
你要见我?
You asked to see me?

376
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:50,536
Stackhouse 找到了
一个合适的阿尔法站点
Stackhouse has found
a suitable Alpha Site,

377
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,763
因此一旦需要的话
我们就能够撤离了
so should the need arise,
we'll be able to evacuate.

378
00:21:52,902 --> 00:21:53,598
噢, 那很好
Oh, that's good.

379
00:21:53,737 --> 00:21:56,660
这并不是我想见你的原因
That's not why
I wanted to see you.

380
00:21:56,764 --> 00:21:59,478
你必须想办法备份超过7%或者8%
的数据库信息
You have to get me more than seven
or eight percent of the database.

381
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:01,566
我们一定有办法带走更多
There has got to be a way
of taking more with us.

382
00:22:01,704 --> 00:22:03,513
也许9%
Maybe nine percent.

383
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:06,053
那么我是应该选择备份
零点模块研究
How do I choose between
Zero Point Module

384
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:08,315
还是他们关于升天方面的资料呢?
research and their work on ascension.

385
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:12,107
是备份武器的图纸呢
还是他们关于星际旅行的笔记?
I mean, between weapons schematics
and their notes on space travel.

386
00:22:12,246 --> 00:22:16,004
无论我们如何选择
都将会失去很多无价的信息
No matter what we choose here,
invaluable information's gonna be lost,

387
00:22:16,143 --> 00:22:18,891
而这些只是我们解密了的信息
and that is just the information
we've deciphered.

388
00:22:18,995 --> 00:22:22,509
现在我们都知道
我们甚至都还没有钻透它们的表皮
Now we all know we have barely even
begun to scratch the surface.

389
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:25,049
假如我们毁掉的是
治愈所有疾病的药方
What if we destroy
the cure for all disease,

390
00:22:25,189 --> 00:22:29,573
甚至于是某条可以引导我们
打败幽灵的信息呢?
or even some piece of information that could
lead to the downfall of the Wraith.

391
00:22:29,711 --> 00:22:32,495
我不知道该跟你说些什么
I don't know what I can tell you.

392
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:37,122
我会努力提高McKay的压缩算法的压缩比
I will try to improve on
McKay's compression ratio's,

393
00:22:37,227 --> 00:22:42,272
不过我们是在面临战争, Elizabeth
有战争就有伤亡
but we are at war Elizabeth.
In war there are casualties.

394
00:22:47,421 --> 00:22:49,613
啊, 谁来看看这些图表?
Ah, schematics, anyone?

395
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:55,701
看起来能量在内部流动
从缓冲器到武器
It looks like power runs internally,
from the buffer to the weapon.

396
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:56,815
我想在它到达的时候
I guess when it took a hit,

397
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:58,658
它一定会扰动主能量管道
it must have disrupted
the main power conduit.

398
00:22:58,763 --> 00:23:00,398
我们需要变更路线
让能量从我们的缓冲器
We need to reroute
the power from our buffer

399
00:23:00,537 --> 00:23:01,859
到武器中去
to the actual to the actual weapon.

400
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:03,147
如果我们做到这一点, 武器就准备好了
If we can do that, it will arm.

401
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:06,731
知道么, 你说的这些是人都明白
You know, your masterful grip
on the blatantly obvious,

402
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:08,818
继续说话打动我, Peter
continues to impress me, Peter.

403
00:23:08,957 --> 00:23:10,313
谢谢
Thankyou

404
00:23:10,418 --> 00:23:15,915
好吧. 我们需要引导能量
绕过这些损坏的线路
Alright. We need to route power around
these damaged circuits.

405
00:23:16,507 --> 00:23:22,004
如果我们做到了, 那就可以好好轻松一下了
好吧, 我现在完全分不清了
If we do that, we should be laughing.
Alright, I'm disoriented.

406
00:23:22,143 --> 00:23:24,092
这些在哪里?
Where are these?

407
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:26,909
它们在外面
They're outside.

408
00:23:27,014 --> 00:23:28,962
什么?
What?

409
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,268
瞧
Look.

410
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:35,990
看到了?
See?

411
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:37,661
哦!
Oh great!

412
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,087
必须有人去进行太空行走
Someone will need to EVA.

413
00:23:39,226 --> 00:23:41,452
那里没有地方可以挂住
There's nothing to hang onto.

414
00:23:41,522 --> 00:23:43,645
我没有说这很容易和安全
I'm not saying it'll be easy or safe.

415
00:23:43,783 --> 00:23:45,767
Ok. 那么谁去?
Ok. So who goes?

416
00:23:48,237 --> 00:23:49,072
好吧, 我们可以抽麦秆
Well, we could draw straws.

417
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:51,160
Ok Miller, 去准备"麦秆"吧!
Ok Miller, break out the straws!

418
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,768
没有必要抽麦秆
It doesn't have to be straws.

419
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:56,795
我们可以石头剪刀布
We could do rock,
paper, scissors.

420
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,996
好吧, 三个人
一, 二, 三
Ok, on three.
One, two, three.

421
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:08,590
Ok, 很明显, 石头剪刀布
并不适合三个人玩
Ok, obviously Rock, Paper, Scissors,
doesn't work with three.

422
00:24:08,695 --> 00:24:09,739
有人有铅笔么?
Anyone have a pencil?

423
00:24:09,877 --> 00:24:12,278
是的, 我想我有一支
Yeah, I think I've got one.

424
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:15,200
好吧, 准备吧
Well, get on with it.

425
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:19,584
Ok. 谁抽到短的那根, 谁就去
Ok. Short piece goes.

426
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:24,524
你先
You go first.

427
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,118
嗯, 很好, 你的很不错
Mmm. Well done.
Good for you.

428
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:38,407
Miller?
是的
Miller?
Yeah.

429
00:24:41,085 --> 00:24:43,556
不管怎么说, 你最有资格去修好它
You're the best qualified to fix it,
anyway sir.

430
00:24:43,695 --> 00:24:47,000
嗯, 一次死亡之旅
好吧
Mmmm. Flight of the dead man.
Good.

431
00:24:51,836 --> 00:24:55,107
我知道她和Bates都彼此憎恨着对方
I know there's no love lost
between her and Bates,

432
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:58,655
不过我并不认为是她打了那个家伙
but I can't see her beating
the hell out of the guy.

433
00:24:58,759 --> 00:24:59,907
Ford?
Ford?

434
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,065
女士?
Ma'am?

435
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,152
你认为呢?
What do you think?

436
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:09,163
我担心她可能是在
不知不觉中去做的
I worry about what she might
have done, unknowingly.

437
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:10,797
那些与幽灵的连接
The whole Wraith connection thing

438
00:25:10,937 --> 00:25:12,538
以及她的恶梦, 都让我很紧张
and her nightmares,
make me nervous.

439
00:25:12,642 --> 00:25:14,798
是的, 那我们应该怎么做呢
Yeah well,
what are we gonna do about it,

440
00:25:14,903 --> 00:25:16,351
把她钉到桅杆上?
我们在谈论的是Teyla啊
stick her in the brig? This is Teyla we're talking about.

441
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,530
我们的人有麻烦了
We have a situation on our hands.

442
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,296
怎么了?
What's going on?

443
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,705
我已经完成了检验
我在Bates军事的制服上找到了DNA
I've completed the tests.
I found DNA in SGT Bates' uniform.

444
00:25:23,845 --> 00:25:24,610
那不是Teyla的
And it's not Teyla's.

445
00:25:24,715 --> 00:25:25,897
不是的, 少校
No Major.

446
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:27,463
是谁的?
Who is it?

447
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:32,021
为了确定, 我检验了两次
结果是决定性的
I ran the test twice to be certain.
It's conclusive.

448
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:34,595
在我们的城市中有一个幽灵
We have a Wraith in the city.

449
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:49,625
这怎么可能啊?
怎么可能有幽灵进入到城市中来?
Can someone tell me how this is possible?
How can a Wraith get inside the city?

450
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,712
不是通过星际之门进来的
They didn't gate in.

451
00:25:51,991 --> 00:25:53,070
那艘梭镖飞船
The dart.

452
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:54,009
什么?
What?

453
00:25:54,148 --> 00:25:56,897
那艘幽灵的梭镖飞船扫描了我们
The Wraith dart that scanned us.

454
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:02,150
它穿过了城市上空
扫描以获取数据
It made it's way through the city,
scanning for data.

455
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:06,430
在它完成的那一刻
它就自毁了
The second it was done,
it self destructed.

456
00:26:06,534 --> 00:26:07,474
这么说它通过光柱潜入到了城市
So he beamed into the city

457
00:26:07,578 --> 00:26:08,518
它们可以做到么?
Can they do that?

458
00:26:08,622 --> 00:26:11,718
这跟将人们吸进它们的飞船
所用的技术相同
The same technology that is used
to sweep people up into their ships,

459
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,214
只是工作的方向相反
must work in the opposite way.

460
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:15,614
就是说幽灵梭镖飞船的飞行员
扫描了我们
So the pilot of the Wraith dart
scanned us,

461
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:18,154
把得到的信息传送给了母船
transmitted his information
to the hive ships,

462
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:20,450
通过光柱下到这里
然后毁掉了它的飞船
beamed down here
and destroyed his ship.

463
00:26:20,555 --> 00:26:21,808
是的, 是的, 看起来是可能的
Yes, yes.
Seem's possible.

464
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,182
正好就是在那时起
我就开始不断的感觉到了幽灵
That is precisely the time
I started to sense the Wraith continually.

465
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:28,349
难怪你总是在做恶梦
No wonder you were having nightmares.

466
00:26:28,488 --> 00:26:30,471
这些时候, 它都在这里做什么?
What's he been doing here, all this time?

467
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,106
Bates军士在为控制台提供能量的
Well, SGT Bates was attacked near

468
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,368
naquadah发电机旁边受到袭击
the naquadah generator
that powers this tower.

469
00:26:34,472 --> 00:26:36,142
它的任务应该是过来侦查
His brief must have been
during recon.

470
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:39,448
也许它的任务是
在母船到达这里的时候切断电源
Maybe his job is to knock out the power
before the hive ship get's here.

471
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:40,769
让我们死在水中
Leave us dead in the water.

472
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:44,144
或者让我们以前所制定的自毁计划
无法工作
Or to make sure any self destruct plan
we had in place, wouldn't work.

473
00:26:44,284 --> 00:26:45,466
也许是两者兼而有之
Maybe a combination of both.

474
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,754
很对
Exactly.

475
00:26:46,893 --> 00:26:49,641
我们现在能够确信的是
What we do know for sure,
is that we have

476
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,712
在我们的城市中有一个幽灵入侵者
我们必须找到它
a Wraith intruder in the city,
that we have to track down.

477
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:55,799
我有办法
I have an idea.

478
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:06,097
我们离开了
We're away.

479
00:27:06,515 --> 00:27:10,238
在不到三十米远的地方
It's not much more than
thirty metres away.

480
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,509
我们已经就位了, 先生
We're in position sir.

481
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:18,762
好的, Miller
我要你打开通风孔
Ok Miller. I want you to vent
the atmosphere and disengage

482
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:23,041
并且解除后部舱室的人工重力
the artificial gravity
in the rear compartment.

483
00:27:28,991 --> 00:27:31,113
Ok, 打开后舱门
Ok, open the rear hatch.

484
00:27:52,301 --> 00:27:54,284
噢, 我的...
Oh my

485
00:27:57,276 --> 00:28:00,338
Rodney?
Rodney, 你到了么?
Rodney?
Rodney, did you make it?

486
00:28:01,938 --> 00:28:04,443
我还没有离开飞船的尾部
I haven't quite left the rear
of the Jumper yet.

487
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:05,939
需要我提醒你时间么?
Do I need to remind you
of the time?

488
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:09,453
是的, 提醒我吧
我们的时间很紧吧?
Yes, please do.
Remind me, are we on a tight schedule?

489
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:11,819
显而易见
Just pointing out the obvious.

490
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:15,263
Ok, 谢谢
我的一小步, 啊?
Ok, thankyou.
One small step, huh?

491
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,338
人类的一大步!
One giant leap!

492
00:28:36,661 --> 00:28:37,774
抱歉?
I'm sorry?

493
00:28:37,913 --> 00:28:38,783
我到了
I made it.

494
00:28:38,922 --> 00:28:40,836
很好
Good.

495
00:28:41,984 --> 00:28:45,185
先看看这第一个面板
Let's take a look at this first panel.

496
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:52,004
这是我们大约一个月前启动的
生物探测器
This is a biometric sensor we've had
online for the past month or so.

497
00:28:52,108 --> 00:28:54,300
它检查不规则的生物频率
It detects irregularities
in biometric rhythm,

498
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:55,240
然后进行报告
and reports them.

499
00:28:55,344 --> 00:28:56,736
那它为什么没有报告那个幽灵?
Wouldn't it have picked
up on the Wraith?

500
00:28:56,875 --> 00:29:01,258
它需要大量的能量
因此我们缩小了它的探测范围
It requires significant amount of power,
so we've narrowed it's field of focus,

501
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:03,103
只让它探测星际之门控制室了
to scan solely in the gateroom,

502
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:05,851
本来是想幽灵或者其他外星人
figuring that was the only
place that the Wraith

503
00:29:05,956 --> 00:29:09,887
只能从那里进入城市
or any other alien for that matter,
would likely enter the city from.

504
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,870
Ok, 现在这种看法是错的了
Ok, so that was wrong.

505
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:16,393
是的. 现在如果我把范围扩展到...
Yeah. Now if I could only
expand the field to...

506
00:29:16,532 --> 00:29:18,167
我的天!
My God!

507
00:29:18,272 --> 00:29:19,385
什么?
What?

508
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,472
那就是它
看!
That's him.
Look!

509
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:28,396
它的工作原理非常类似于生命信号探测器
不过它可以区分不同的生命形式
It works very much like the life signs detector,
but it's able to distinguish different lifeforms.

510
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:29,579
是它
It's him

511
00:29:29,718 --> 00:29:30,587
是它
It's him

512
00:29:30,692 --> 00:29:31,318
你可以实时跟踪它
You can track him in real time.

513
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,466
是的
Yes

514
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:36,990
Ford, Teyla, 我们需要两队人
我们去抓住它
Ford, Teyla, we need two teams.
Let's go get him.

515
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,077
是的, 长官!
Yes sir!

516
00:29:42,243 --> 00:29:46,975
很糟糕, 非常糟糕
我不知道我能不能修好它
This is bad, very bad.
I'm not sure I can fix this.

517
00:29:47,114 --> 00:29:48,436
你可以修好任何东西
You can fix anything.

518
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:49,619
谁告诉你的?
Who told you that?

519
00:29:49,758 --> 00:29:51,567
你已经做过几次了
You did on several occasions.

520
00:29:51,672 --> 00:29:52,506
好吧, 你是对的
Well you're right.

521
00:29:52,611 --> 00:29:55,012
那可能是件好事
我抽到了最短的麦秆
It's probably a good thing
I drew the short straw.

522
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:57,099
差不多是这样
That's more like it.

523
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:11,468
主电力管道已经被严重损坏了
The main power conduit's been severed.

524
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:14,112
我也许有办法可以变更路线
There may be some way
for me to reroute it,

525
00:30:14,252 --> 00:30:17,035
让它通过副管道
so that it's going through
secondary conduits.

526
00:30:17,174 --> 00:30:19,088
就像是一种旁路那样
Sort of like a quadruple bypass.

527
00:30:19,227 --> 00:30:23,019
我在这里应该可以帮助你
标出一个潜在的副管道
I should be able to help you identify
a potential secondary conduits from here.

528
00:30:23,123 --> 00:30:27,681
我们的时间只够尝试一次
We're only going to have enough time
to try this once.

529
00:30:27,821 --> 00:30:29,769
让我们开始吧
Let's get started.

530
00:30:30,464 --> 00:30:31,648
它还在那里么, 博士?
Is he still in place, Doc?

531
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:37,840
是的, 它还在那个房间里
自从我们找到之后就没有动过
Yes, he's still in the same room.
Hasn't moved since we located him.

532
00:30:37,944 --> 00:30:41,390
希望它还在睡觉
Ford, Teyla, 你们就位了么?
Let's hope he's still sleeping.
Ford, Teyla, you in position?

533
00:30:41,528 --> 00:30:43,477
快了
Almost.

534
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,652
我的队伍已经准备好了
My team's ready.

535
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:52,592
我们准备同时从不同的方向
冲进那个房间
We're going to breach the room
at the same time from different directions.

536
00:30:52,731 --> 00:30:55,862
如果它试图从另外一个门出去
抓住它
If he tries to get out the other door, take him.

537
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:56,628
明白
Understood sir.

538
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:59,028
我们两分钟后就到
We shouldn't be more than
a couple of minutes.

539
00:30:59,168 --> 00:31:01,081
很好, 准备行动
Alright, stand by.

540
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:32,706
Ok, 我在这能做的就是这些了
能量过去了么?
Ok, that's all I can do from here.
Is power getting through?

541
00:31:32,812 --> 00:31:34,551
是的, 能量已经过去了
Yes, the power is getting through.

542
00:31:34,655 --> 00:31:37,195
噢, 感谢上帝!
好了, 我准备结束这次太空行走
Oh thank God!
Ok, I'm gonna end this EVA.

543
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:41,579
我回到飞船, 我们把你带上
然后我们离开这里
I'm coming in,we're gonna pick you up
and get the hell out of here.

544
00:31:41,718 --> 00:31:42,935
听起来像是一个计划
Sounds like a plan, sir.

545
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:45,023
好吧
Alright.

546
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:06,246
没有什么可以阻止我们
前往我们的新取食场
Nothing will keep us
from our new feeding ground.

547
00:32:14,735 --> 00:32:16,405
我们都听到了, 长官
You were on vox, sir.

548
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:20,128
我们听到了一切
然后快步赶了过来
We heard the whole thing
and double timed it.

549
00:32:20,268 --> 00:32:23,677
我们抓住它了, 少校
你会没事的
We got him Major.
You're gonna be ok.

550
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,811
Peter, 我们没法停靠到卫星上
Peter, we're having trouble docking
with the satellite.

551
00:32:38,951 --> 00:32:41,247
看看你那边能够做些什么
See what you can do
from your side.

552
00:32:41,386 --> 00:32:42,847
哦, 想起来了
Oh dear.

553
00:32:42,952 --> 00:32:43,995
想起来什么?
Oh dear, what?

554
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:47,718
当我们改变能量从缓冲区到武器的线路时
When we rerouted the power from
the buffer to the weapon,

555
00:32:47,858 --> 00:32:53,632
看起来好像我们不经意间
把通往停靠站和气闸盖的能量也引开了
it looks like we inadvertantly routed power
away from the docking station and the air lock.

556
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,511
这会是个问题
That's going to be a problem.

557
00:32:55,651 --> 00:32:57,564
Ok, 我们手动操作
就像我们第一次做的那样
Ok, we'll do it manually,
like we did the first time.

558
00:32:57,564 --> 00:33:03,514
第一次你有太空服, 而我现在没有
打开气闸盖会使舱内失压
You had a spacesuit the first time, I don't.
The airlock isn't pressurised.

559
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:08,350
那么我们... 听着,
我会回去重新改变能量线路
Then we'll... Look,
I'll go back and reroute the power.

560
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:11,342
没时间了
幽灵的飞船已经很近了
There isn't time for that.
The Wraith ships are too close.

561
00:33:11,481 --> 00:33:12,664
我知道我在做什么
I know what I'm doing now.

562
00:33:12,802 --> 00:33:14,751
Rodney.
别管我
Rodney.
Leave me.

563
00:33:16,665 --> 00:33:18,057
我们不会这样做的
We're not doing that.

564
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:20,561
飞到安全距离之外
然后在卫星教训完幽灵的飞船之后
Get to a safe distance,
and then come get me once

565
00:33:20,701 --> 00:33:23,171
再回来接我
the satellite has taken care
of the Wraith ships.

566
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:23,658
Peter.
Peter.

567
00:33:23,762 --> 00:33:26,615
这是唯一的选择
你知道的
It's the only option
and you know it.

568
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:29,816
另外, 这样我也可以先关掉卫星
Besides, this way
I can power down the satellite,

569
00:33:29,955 --> 00:33:32,008
直到它们都进入了射程再打开
until they're well within range.

570
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:34,513
这样幽灵就不会知道
Then there'll be no way
for the Wraith

571
00:33:34,652 --> 00:33:37,540
我们已经让它重新运转起来了
to realise that we've brought
it back online.

572
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,654
好吧, 我们会隐形
然后在结束后回来接你
Alright, we'll cloak and come back
for you after it's done.

573
00:33:42,794 --> 00:33:44,776
在这结束之后
After it's done then.

574
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:13,063
很高兴看到你又能站起来了, 长官
感觉怎么样?
Good to see you on your feet sir.
How are you feeling?

575
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:16,959
有些发麻和刺痛
被那些东西击昏之后都有这个感觉
You know, pins and needles.
Getting stung by those damn things.

576
00:34:17,064 --> 00:34:18,594
它说了什么没有?
Has he said anything yet?

577
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:20,682
没有, 长官, 还没有
No sir, not yet.

578
00:34:26,596 --> 00:34:28,509
你有名字么?
You got a name?

579
00:34:32,163 --> 00:34:34,425
Ok, 我们就叫你Bob吧, Bob
Ok, we'll go with Bob, Bob,

580
00:34:34,563 --> 00:34:38,391
我想知道, 过去两个星期
I'm gonna need to know what
you've been doing

581
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:43,923
你都在这里做了些什么
现在就想知道
here for the past two weeks and
I'm going to need to know now.

582
00:35:03,545 --> 00:35:08,729
如果你还没有启动
现在应该是时候了
If you're not already powered up,
now would be a good time.

583
00:35:10,712 --> 00:35:12,695
正在启动!
Powering up!

584
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:23,515
我们在60秒后就可以预热好武器
We should be weapons
hot in 60 seconds.

585
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:29,047
Weir博士, 我是McKay
卫星已经准备好战斗了
Dr Weir, it's McKay.
The satellite is armed and ready.

586
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,587
它大约可以在一分钟内射击
It should fire within
the next minute or so.

587
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:33,222
等着看好戏吧
Keep your fingers crossed.

588
00:35:33,327 --> 00:35:35,866
我们在等!
祝好运!
Fingers crossed!
Good luck!

589
00:35:48,218 --> 00:35:50,549
我想他现在没有心情说话, 长官
I don't think he's in
a very talkative mood, sir.

590
00:35:50,688 --> 00:35:52,602
我想知道它做了些什么
I need to know what he's been
doing and whether

591
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,898
以及它是否正在向母船传送信息
or not he's been transferring
data to the hive ships.

592
00:35:55,037 --> 00:35:57,264
我们无法截获这种传输么?
Wouldn't we have picked
up the transmission?

593
00:35:57,402 --> 00:36:00,082
我们可以发送加密信息
没有理由它不能这样做
We can send secure messages,
there's no reason he can't.

594
00:36:00,221 --> 00:36:03,526
也许我可以试着跟它建立连接
Maybe I can try and connect
with him.

595
00:36:04,326 --> 00:36:06,275
我不这样认为
I don't think so.

596
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:12,363
如果阿尔法站点已经被发现了, 少校
If the Alpha Site has been
compromised Major,

597
00:36:12,502 --> 00:36:14,416
我们需要知道
we need to know.

598
00:36:20,818 --> 00:36:22,975
好吧, 看看你能做些什么
Ok, see what you can do.

599
00:36:47,085 --> 00:36:52,548
从手动模式切换到自动开火模式
就绪!
Switching over from manual
to automatic firing mode. Stand by!

600
00:36:54,705 --> 00:36:56,688
就绪
Standing by.

601
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,876
我们已经干掉一艘了!
We have a kill!

602
00:37:20,903 --> 00:37:22,817
我们收到了, Rodney
We copy that, Rodney.

603
00:37:22,956 --> 00:37:24,905
打下了一艘, 还有两艘
One down, two to go.

604
00:37:32,141 --> 00:37:34,437
你在做什么, 人类?
What are you doing, human?

605
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:42,404
你正在试图进入我的意识
You're trying to get inside my mind.

606
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,815
允许我!
Allow me!

607
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:58,583
Teyla? 停下来!
你在做什么?
Teyla? Stop it!
What are you doing?

608
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:04,184
你还好吧?
Are you ok?

609
00:38:07,142 --> 00:38:08,811
我身上的创伤会自动恢复
My wounds will heal.

610
00:38:08,915 --> 00:38:10,968
是的, 不过要多久?
Yeah, but for how long?

611
00:38:14,552 --> 00:38:18,519
我要知道你对这个城市做了些什么
I need to know what
you've done to this city.

612
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:26,172
听着Bob, 不管怎样
我都可以轻松的杀死你
Listen Bob. I have no problem
with killing you, whatsoever.

613
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:38,280
快点, 快点
再次出击啊!
Come on, come on.
Hit em again!

614
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:39,811
我们有问题了!
We have a problem!

615
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,898
什么, 什么问题?
What, what problem?

616
00:38:43,046 --> 00:38:47,083
看起来好像是
我们改线之后的发送器过载了
It looks like the sender
we rerouted has overloaded.

617
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:51,570
武器不能再次发射了
我正试图寻找其它的方法
The weapon can't fire again.
I'm trying to find another pathway.

618
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:52,927
我们就回来接你
We're heading back in to pick you up.

619
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,319
呆在原地别动!
Stay exactly where you are!

620
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:56,128
我们已经隐形了, 它们不会看到我们的!
Look, we're cloaked,
they won't see us!

621
00:38:56,268 --> 00:39:00,477
没有时间了
快点离开这里!
There's no time,
just get the hell out of here!

622
00:39:04,095 --> 00:39:05,522
我很抱歉!
I'm sorry!

623
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:08,166
把我们带回到卫星那里去
Get us back to that satellite.

624
00:39:18,047 --> 00:39:19,996
噢, 天哪!
Oh God!

625
00:39:22,118 --> 00:39:27,685
我不是在跟你浪费时间, Bob!
你到底对这个基地采取了破坏行动没有?
I'm not screwing around Bob!
Did you sabotage this base or not?

626
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:36,765
那些从你身上取食的幽灵
将会知道你对我所做的一切
Those who feed upon you,
will know what you've done to me.

627
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:42,540
是的, 那我们来看看吧
Yeah, we'll see.

628
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,115
长官! 我想我们也许有点过头了
Sir! I think maybe we've gone a bit too far.

629
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:47,446
我认为我们还做得不够
I don't think we've gone far enough.

630
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:52,282
亚特兰蒂斯, 我是McKay!
我们已经失去了卫星!
Atlantis, this is McKay!
We have lost the satellite!

631
00:39:56,213 --> 00:39:58,128
你们有没有打下更多的飞船?
Did you manage to take
out any more ships?

632
00:39:58,266 --> 00:40:02,371
没有, 另外两艘飞船都完好无损
Negative. The two other
hive ships are intact.

633
00:40:02,894 --> 00:40:07,312
Elizabeth, Peter Grodin
当时正在卫星上
Elizabeth, Peter Grodin
was aboard the satellite.

634
00:40:10,757 --> 00:40:14,862
明白
另外两艘是什么状态?
Understood.
What's the status of the other two?

635
00:40:14,966 --> 00:40:17,124
它们没有继续靠近了
They're not coming any closer.

636
00:40:17,262 --> 00:40:19,732
看起来好像它们在重新考虑它们的计划
Looks like they're rethinking
their plans.

637
00:40:19,872 --> 00:40:22,517
至少来说, 他为我们带来更多的时间
At the very least,
he's bought us some time.

638
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:27,770
你在那儿也做不了什么了, Rodney
返回亚特兰蒂斯吧
You can't do anymore out there Rodney.
Return to Atlantis.

639
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,633
正回来
On our way

640
00:40:40,852 --> 00:40:42,799
我要对整个城市讲话
Put me on city wide.

641
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:51,393
各位请注意
我是Weir博士
May I have your attention please.
This is Doctor Weir.

642
00:40:51,776 --> 00:40:55,777
我们阻止幽灵舰队的计划失败了
Our plan to stop
the Wraith Armada, has failed.

643
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:58,491
它们会直取亚特兰蒂斯
They will make it to Atlantis.

644
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:02,631
因此, 我们必须开始我们的撤退计划
Therefore, we must begin
our evacuation plans.

645
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:08,372
我希望我能够告诉你们
这是一场我们可以打赢的战争
I wish I could tell you all that this
is a fight that we will win,

646
00:41:08,476 --> 00:41:10,251
可是我做不到
but I can't do that.

647
00:41:10,389 --> 00:41:16,860
我希望我可以告诉你们, 到我们离开
这里时, 我们可以找到一个安全的避风港
I wish I could tell you that we will find
a safe harbour when we leave here.

648
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,558
这个我也不能向你们保证
我能够告诉你们的是
I can't promise you that either.
I can tell you this.

649
00:41:21,697 --> 00:41:26,777
直到现在为止
你们大家都已经实现了非凡的成就
Up till now, you all have accomplished
extraordinary things,

650
00:41:26,881 --> 00:41:31,995
并且我确信
即使是面对无法确定的未来
and I believe that even in
the face of an uncertain future,

651
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:37,771
只要我们团结在一起
我们就还有生存的希望
as long as we stay together we have
a chance to continue to do so.

652
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:41,249
现在, 我们都有撤退的职责
Now, we all have
our evacuation duties.

653
00:41:41,389 --> 00:41:45,703
谢谢你们
我会在另外一边见到你们
So thankyou,
and I'll see you on the other side.

654
00:41:51,235 --> 00:41:55,793
Zelenka博士?
把病毒程序准备好
Doctor Zelenka?
Put the virus programme on standby.

655
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:23,939
我告诉你们
不管你们逃到哪里, 我们都会找到你们
I will tell you this.
No matter where you flee, we will find you.

656
00:42:24,322 --> 00:42:30,376
就跟我们一定会找到地球一样
Just as surely as we will find Earth.

657
00:42:33,376 --> 00:42:39,060
到那时, 我们会进行一次盛宴
And when we do, we will feast.

658
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,260
