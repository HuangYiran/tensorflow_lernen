1
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,270
Really? Do you have
to do this right now?

2
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,460
Wow,that's the first time
anyone ever complained

3
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,560
about me doing too
much work around here.

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,160
Why don't you go do that on the deck?

5
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,110
Because... this is my house.

6
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,500
I can work out wherever I want.

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,950
Besides,when I do yoga on the
deck,the kids on the beach call me gay.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,610
You sure that's not because
you live with a middle-aged man?

9
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,750
Morning.

10
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,750
Morning.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,120
Ooh,a little yoga?

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,800
Yeah,I'm just trying to clear my head.

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,260
Um,speaking of heads,Buddha's
poking his out of the temple.

14
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,950
You know what? If I lived
here alone,it wouldn't matter.

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,760
Right. Sorry. Namaste.

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,860
- What does "Namast" actually mean?
- Get out!

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,090
Okay. I'm gonna
"nama-not-stay" right here.

18
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,850
Okay,focus. I want
peace... I want serenity...

19
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,780
I want a murder weapon.

20
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,160
Dude! You need to relax.
Do some yoga or something.

21
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,820
What is that?

22
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,430
It's a holistic hangover cure.

23
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,530
Kale,wheatgrass,three
shots of tequila. Cheers.

24
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,990
You know what? Screw
it. I'm gonna stay drunk.

25
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:45,380
Oh,yikes. Think I ate a little
too much ginger last night.

26
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,680
Oh,you had sushi for dinner?

27
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,330
Yeah,let's go with that.

28
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:52,850
It's crazy,isn't it?

29
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,310
We finally get rid of Jake,and now
we got another one on our hands.

30
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,880
Yeah,about that... What is
the long-range plan here?

31
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,010
I don't know.

32
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,340
I always thought we'd spend
our golden years together.

33
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,840
Eventually,maybe sell the
beach house,move to the desert,

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,490
spend our days toiling
in our cactus garden.

35
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,240
Yeah,that sounds swell,but...

36
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,640
Go out to early bird dinners
wearing matching jumpsuits...

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,750
Okay. Look,I'm not gonna wear a jump...

38
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,240
All right. You know what?

39
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,940
Let's try this another way.

40
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,580
Uh,in your romantic fantasy
of our future,where is Jenny?

41
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,110
She'll spend Christmas with us,

42
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,680
but we're gonna want our alone time.

43
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,670
Okay,let's focus on that word "alone.

44
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,440
Having house guests is the best.

45
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,450
You know,you get excited to see them,

46
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,280
you put out the fluffy towels,you
hold your farts,everything's nice...

47
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,990
but,eventually,you have to fart.

48
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,430
Here's what you do.

49
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,960
Uh,you go out on the deck,and
pretend to look at the ocean,

50
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,980
wait for a big wave and
when it breaks,so do you.

51
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,450
Alan,I'm putting in a home gym.

52
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,170
And it's either going in
Jenny's room or Alan's room.

53
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,170
It's your call.

54
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,310
Bitch be gone.

55
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:10,910

58
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,800
Here we go.

59
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,520
An appletini a day
keeps the doctor away.

60
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,110
Cute. And what keeps Alan away?

61
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,550
You.

62
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,620
Touch . Why am I here?

63
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,700
Oh,I just thought we could get together.

64
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,900
Maybe find out what's going
on in each other's lives.

65
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,500
There's never anything
going on in your life,Alan.

66
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,680
Okay,you start.

67
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,760
All right,let's see...

68
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,480
Well,my boyfriend
Marty has just moved in.

69
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,170
Moved in? That's a little fast.

70
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,680
He's 91 and a half.

71
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,310
He doesn't do anything fast.

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,260
So you two sleep in the same room?

73
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,660
If you're trying to find
out if we have sex,yes,we do.

74
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,420
Frequently and nastily.

75
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,350
Good God! The man is in a wheelchair.

76
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,660
How do you think he got there?

77
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,680
No,I was asking if your
guest room is available.

78
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,260
Darling,I-I would love for
you to come stay with me,

79
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,820
but with Marty there
now,it's-it's impossible.

80
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,060
Oh,not me. Jenny.

81
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,580
Oh,Jennifer can move in.

82
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,520
Wait. Why can she move in and not me?

83
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,590
Darling,if you were a child,this
would be one of those situations

84
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,080
where I would give you
five dollars to shut up.

85
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,390
Well,I'm not a kid anymore,Mom.

86
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,280
How's $20 sound?

87
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,740
No,I want to have this conversation.

88
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,170
- Forty.
- We're done.

89
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,810
All right,I'm out of here.

90
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,600
Don't be a stranger,Jenny.

91
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,510
I me,I know that you are one but that
didn't stop me from letting you stay here.

92
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,030
And that didn't stop me
from throwing up in your...

93
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,290
Ah,you know,you'll figure it out.

94
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,100
Um,h-have you got everything?

95
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,330
Yeah,I think so.

96
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,910
There's a girl in my
room,uh,Tara,Tanya...

97
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,940
I don't really know what
the hell her name is.

98
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,360
It's tattooed right above her ass.

99
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,030
Anyway,when she wakes up,will
you give her this for cab fare?

100
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:13,300
And uh,uh... tell her I,"Mackenzie," will
call her if I get back from the Congo.

101
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,760
See you.

102
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,560
- Bye.
- Take care.

103
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,890
Can you believe that?

104
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,600
I know. A Harper left
this house voluntarily.

105
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,420
And gave me money.

106
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,330
Hi,Alan.

107
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,750
Lyndsey. This is a surprise.

108
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,370
I know; I-I'm sorry.

109
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,020
I just need to talk to you in person.

110
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,360
Oh,yeah,yeah. Come on in.

111
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,300
Are we alone?

112
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,950
Never!

113
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,660
Hi,Walden.

114
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,900
Can we talk in private?

115
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,280
Oh,sure,let's go in my room.

116
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,930
Oh,uh,hold on a second.

117
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,490
Okay,we're all set.

118
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,210
Aw,dude,come on!

119
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
So what's up?

120
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:17,800
Nipple!

121
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,860
I am so mad at you.

122
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:21,700
Why?

123
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,160
Because I-I'm with Larry now.

124
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,200
He's smart,handsome,successful...

125
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,470
God,you have a type.

126
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,670
No. When I'm with him,I can't
stop fantasizing about you.

127
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,610
Okay,I-I-I'm
confused.

128
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,920
I'm getting a chubby,but I'm confused.

129
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,480
So you want to get back together?

130
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,790
Oh,God,no.

131
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,550
I just want to have sex with you.

132
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,450
Why? And why am I asking?

133
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,910
I don't know. I just know that I do.

134
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,580
Of course. Forbidden
fruit is so much sweeter.

135
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,270
Go on,pluck my forbidden fruit.

136
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,270
Pop my cherry. Peel my banana.

137
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,030
Squeeze my fuzzy peaches.

138
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,330
In my fantasy...

139
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,950
you don't talk.

140
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,430
Bye,Walden.

141
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,770
Bye,Lyndsey.

142
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,080
Um,is it hot in here
or did I just have sex?

143
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,300
Did you guys get back together?

144
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,370
Better.

145
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,390
She wants nothing from me
except the old Harper harpoon.

146
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,220
Know what I'm sayin'?

147
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,930
How is it possible that
you're having sex and I'm not?

148
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,330
Well,apparently,her perfect boyfriend
Larry has an Achilles heel...

149
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,010
and it's on his penis.

150
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,070
have you guys seen Mackenzie?

151
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,270
- She went to Cabo.
- Congo.

152
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,510
- She's not here.
- She's dead.

153
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,390
In the Congo.

154
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,180
- Sorry,Tanya.
- Tara.

155
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,700
Alyssa.

156
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,800
So... Evy tells me you
want to be an actress.

157
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,410
I figured with my daddy issues,it
was either that or stripping.

158
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,630
You've certainly got
the rack for either one.

159
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,430
Bless your heart.

160
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,540
My heart is in a landfill.

161
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,190
This baby belonged to a drunken
quarterback from Alabama.

162
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,410
Roll Tide!

163
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,590
You know,Marty is a television legend.

164
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,230
He created  Here Comes Pleshkin.

165
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,800
I love that show.

166
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,130
Th-That was a drinking game in college.

167
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,430
Every time someone would yell "Pleshkin!

168
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,110
" I would take a shot.

169
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,440
I had so much drunken
sex because of your show.

170
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,160
It was a piece of crap,but
it paid for my first six...

171
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,630
seven  wives.

172
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,260
And Pleshkin? Hermaphrodite.

173
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,880
Once,he comes in three hours late.

174
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,870
I tell him to go screw himself.

175
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,860
He says,"Why do you think
I'm three hours late?

176
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,490
" That's a joke,sweetheart.
Feel free to laugh.

177
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,340
Is this thing on? Roll Tide!

178
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,070
Pleshkin!

179
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,090
I need another one. Marty?

180
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,140
Why not?

181
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,400
I got my liver from a narcoleptic
Vietnamese rickshaw driver.

182
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,990
Evy,that's the best gift
you have ever given me.

183
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,910
What do you mean?

184
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,470
You,me,Jenny,a handful
of little blue pills...

185
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,900
It's like the Spring Break
of '43 all over again!

186
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,770
Marty,she's my granddaughter.

187
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,730
I know.

188
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:50,930
I have had some of the most decadent
sexual encounters imaginable:

189
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,910
mother/daughter,twins,triplets,Pleshkin.

190
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:01,180
But never the elusive
grandmother/granddaughter combo.

191
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,980
She's gay.

192
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,930
It just keeps getting better.

193
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,180
Sweetheart,while-while I normally
love your unique brand of depravity,

194
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,690
this is where I draw the line.

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,100
So when it's me and
the plumber,it's fine.

196
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,650
You wanted that as much as I did.

197
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,020
I had my eye on his kidney.

198
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,990
This is so exciting.

199
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,320
- Another man's bed,another man's woman,another man's...
- Home!

200
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,110
I know,it's so dirty.

201
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,530
No,no,no,the garage door just opened!

202
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,520
And here comes the car.

203
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,790
Beep! Beep!

204
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,570
No,Larry's home! Get out!

205
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,760
What do I do? What do I do? Uh...

206
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,980
Hide in the closet? Uh... under the bed?

207
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,600
Ooh,I could put on a wig and a dress
and pretend I'm one of your friends.

208
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,080
Out the window!

209
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,270
Right,good call.

210
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,840
Whoa,we are up there. Oh,beautiful view.

211
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,750
Hey,is that the Hollywood sign...

212
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,000
What happened to you?

213
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,070
Oh,these?

214
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,170
I was with Lyndsey last
night,at her boyfriend's house,

215
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,080
and he came home early,and
I had to jump out the window.

216
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,180
Alan Harper: Love Burglar.

217
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,940
I like it better than
Alan Harper: Roommate.

218
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,690
It's just so much fun to be
thought of as a piece of meat.

219
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,800
She doesn't care about
what I think or what I say.

220
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,380
I know how she feels.

221
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,010
Let me ask you something.

222
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,340
How would you like it if you were
the poor schmuck being cheated on?

223
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,060
I've always been the poor schmuck.

224
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,400
And how did it feel?

225
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,710
Horrible.

226
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,770
Ha-ha,suck it,Larry!

227
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,590
I know you're having
fun,Alan,but sooner or later,

228
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,860
somebody's gonna get hurt.

229
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,890
Oh,believe me,someone
got hurt last night.

230
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,090
Boom,boom,boom!

231
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,920
Know what I'm saying?

232
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,230
Okay,from now on,

233
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,170
let's just assume that I know what
you're saying and I don't like it.

234
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,250
All right,you are hair-free.

235
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,950
You missed a spot.

236
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,760
You are a dirty old man.

237
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,640
If I'm such a dirty old man,maybe
it's time for my sponge bath.

238
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,230
Paging Nurse Evelyn! Report to
Marty's crotch with a loofah!

239
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,150
You ready to go?

240
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,450
I'll be right with you,dear.

241
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,370
Where are you going?

242
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,670
What about
rubba-dub-dub,Marty's in the tub?

243
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,390
I'll be right back. We're
just going to the spa.

244
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,320
Yeah,Marty,you'll be happy.

245
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:34,010
When I she comes back,she'll
have less hair than your ears.

246
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,520
But this is date night.

247
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,220
I'll be back by 8:00.

248
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,250
That's after  Wheel. I'll be asleep.

249
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,830
I'll make it up to you in the morning.

250
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,520
I'm
91-and-a-half!

251
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,970
I can't plan that far ahead!

252
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,970
That was amazing.

253
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,920
It was. You seen my underwear?

254
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,990
Do you mean... these?

255
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,330
You know what? Keep 'em.

256
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,770
Ooh,thank you.

257
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,680
Where you going?

258
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,460
What do you mean? Home. We're done.

259
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,630
So it's just wham,bam,thank you...

260
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,590
incredibly powerful,yet
sensitive lover man?

261
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,640
Aw,don't get my panties in a bunch.

262
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,130
I'm serious. We never talk.

263
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,230
Because we're not dating.

264
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,910
I thought you were okay with this.

265
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,550
I am. That doesn't mean we can't take
an interest in each others' lives.

266
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,280
For example,did you know
Charlie had a daughter?

267
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,850
- Really?
- Yeah!

268
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,890
That's great! You can talk to her.

269
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,660
Fine. Whatever.

270
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,010
Oh,for the love of God!
What do you want from me?

271
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,580
Well,if you must know,she's coming
over for dinner tomorrow night,

272
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,920
and I just thought that
maybe you'd like to join us.

273
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,560
Dinner? Seriously?

274
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,120
Forget I mentioned it.

275
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,400
Okay,look,I'll see what I can do.

276
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,050
- Really?
- I'll try.

277
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,950
Oh,thank you. You've made me so happy.

278
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,030
Great. See ya.

279
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,780
I should've just bought a damn vibrator.

280
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,600
Here ya go,Marty.

281
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,010
Just the way you like
it-- scotch and Metamucil.

282
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,090
Why aren't we eating? It's almost 6:00.

283
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,000
Where are we,France?

284
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,950
We're waiting for Alan's girlfriend.

285
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,630
I thought he was Alan's girlfriend?

286
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,180
No. I own the house. It's
actually a funny story.

287
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,430
I was on the beach and I went...

288
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,850
Don't care.

289
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,450
Marty,don't be rude.

290
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,570
I'm sorry. Low blood sugar.

291
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,460
Plus,I really don't care.

292
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,250
Unbelievable.

293
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,580
Lyndsey's not answering any of my calls
and she hasn't returned any of my texts.

294
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,110
I told you you were gonna get hurt.

295
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,610
I told you you were gonna get hurt.

296
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,560
You know what? I'm gonna go get her.

297
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,080
And don't try to stop me.

298
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,820
- Okay.  
- No problem.

299
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,720
Now that buzzkill is gone...
anyone want to get high?

300
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,270
Roll joint!

301
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,890
You think Alan's gonna mind
that we started without him?

302
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,930
Who's Alan?

303
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,200
You know... I think I banged
Lucille Ball in this house.

304
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,700
She was my second-favorite redhead.

305
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,230
Thank you.

306
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,400
Wait a second. It's night.

307
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,940
Why am I still here?

308
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,130
I'll see you tomorrow.

309
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,000
Are you okay to drive?

310
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,460
I'm fine.

311
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,070
Well,let me know when you get home.

312
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,550
I'm home.

313
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,340
Your father would've loved this night.

314
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,870
We're all drunk,we're all
high,and Alan's not here.

315
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,170
Wait--
who's Alan?

316
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,770
You know what we should do tomorrow?

317
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,480
Go to the Malibu Police Station.

318
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,620
They took more pictures
of your dad than I did.

319
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:05,350
Again? I want to stay home
and play naked  Jeopardy.

320
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,010
I want to spend time with my daughter.

321
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,200
Granddaughter.

322
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,990
Oh,please,nobody's buying that.

323
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,630
I am going into the living room,Evelyn.
I suggest you push me there.

324
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,830
We need to talk.

325
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,760
Be back in a minute. There's a 50-50
chance he won't remember what he wants.

326
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,290
If you're gonna talk about me,you
shouldn't shave my ears first.

327
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,370
He's great.

328
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,200
Wonder what it's like to be 91.

329
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,230
I imagine that you're wet
in the places you used to be

330
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,910
dry and dry in the
places you used to be wet.

331
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,320
What's wrong?

332
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,190
Your granddaughter is
coming between us...

333
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,520
and not in the good way.

334
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,730
Look,Marty,she just came into my life.

335
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,090
And believe it or not,

336
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,360
I wasn't always the best mom
to Charlie or-or the other one.

337
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,690
Jennifer is my second chance.

338
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,790
You got to make a choice.
It's me or the kid.

339
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,440
I love you,Marty,but I have
to pick my granddaughter.

340
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:14,080
You know,I have $400 million.

341
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,680
I'm not saying it isn't close.

342
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,210
It's over.

343
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:26,130
Okay,I'm bluffing. I really miss you.

344
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,100
I miss you too,money... honey.

345
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,320
Maybe I can make it up to you.

346
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,720
If you can make it down to
me,you can make it up to me.

347
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,420
Something tells me that
Marty doesn't want me around.

348
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,420
What?!  I can't imagine
anyone not wanting you around.

349
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,150
Really? Because I'm pretty sure
I'm staying at my grandmother's

350
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,420
because you don't want me around.

351
00:17:54,590 --> 00:18:00,310
No...  Maybe... Yes...

352
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,600
I get it.

353
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,550
You already have Alan.

354
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:06,970
I do.

355
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,090
Hey,do you think I'd
look good in a jumpsuit?

356
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,150
You'd look good in anything.

357
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,590
That's 'cause I'm good-looking.

358
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,370
I pretend like I don't know.

359
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,820
Seriously,if you want privacy,then
why do you have a roommate?

360
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,920
Oh,you know,Alan's way
more than a roommate.

361
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,410
He's my best friend.

362
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,480
He was there for me
when I was all alone.

363
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,350
He even took me into my own house.

364
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:39,950
You know,him and-and his stoner son
and his horny mom and your dead dad.

365
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,430
I mean,they've really become my family.

366
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Mine,too.

367
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,710
I guess that means you're
becoming part of my family.

368
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,410
I'm the most masculine
person in this house.

369
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,040
I like you,Jenny.

370
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,490
I like you,Walden.

371
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:06,260
If you were a chick,I
would totally do you.

372
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,450
Aw! You,too!

373
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,850
Hey,you're welcome to crash here any
time you need a break from Evelyn and...

374
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,960
91-and-a-half
shades of gray.

375
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,140
Seriously?

376
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,040
Yeah. You know,I was thinking about
putting in a home gym,but big deal.

377
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,080
I'd rather have a Jenny than a gym.

378
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,580
You and me both.

379
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,180
I get it. 'Cause Jim
and gym are homonyms and

380
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,040
you're a "hamma-sexual""

381
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,070
It's awfully quiet in
there. Did they leave?

382
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,850
I don't know. Let me go look.

383
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,610
I shouldn't have looked.

384
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,410
No matter what she says,do not cry.

385
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,890
You're the prize here.

386
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,830
Alan,what are you doing here?

387
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,720
What are  you  doing here?

388
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,000
You're supposed to be
at my house for dinner.

389
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,380
I said I would try.

390
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,680
And I said I wouldn't cry.

391
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,630
And I guess we're both liars now.

392
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,310
Would you keep it down? Larry's here.

393
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,200
What? You don't want
him to hear your whore?

394
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,810
'Cause that's all I
am to you-- your whore!

395
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,980
We agreed this was just about sex.

396
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,500
Well,forgive me for falling in love.

397
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,940
Alan,if you don't leave right
now,you're never gonna see this again.

398
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,310
Call at your convenience.

399
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,870
I'll get that.

400
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,800
It's probably Lyndsey looking for a
little morning wood to start her fire.

401
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,830
Know what I'm saying?

402
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,960
I know what you're saying,I just
don't know  why  you're saying it.

403
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,430
Uh,hello?

404
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,880
Mackenzie,you lying bitch!

405
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,610
Congo,my ass! Don't run!
You don't want to run!

406
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,140
Yeah,it feels like home again.

407
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,820
