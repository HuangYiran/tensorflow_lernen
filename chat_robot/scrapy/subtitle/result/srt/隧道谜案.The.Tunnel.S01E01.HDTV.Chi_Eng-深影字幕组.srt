欧洲隧道终点站 法国加莱市

2
00:01:28,563 --> 00:01:33,320
STTS19 能把服务隧道中点的灯打开吗

3
00:01:33,644 --> 00:01:34,677
收到

4
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:53,837
- 看上去不像是事故 - 通知英国方面

5
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,236
她死在法国还是英国的边境
Is she on the French or the UK side?

6
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:57,603
她在国境线的正中间

7
00:01:57,603 --> 00:01:58,716
她似乎不是欧洲隧道的员工
No, she doesn't seem to be Eurotunnel staff.

8
00:01:58,716 --> 00:01:59,962
位于内部管理隧道

9
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,199
法国人派了一组犯罪现场调查员
The French are sending a crime unit.

10
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,100
英国警方也会参与
The British police will also attend.

11
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:09,843
- 是她吧 - 没错

12
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,439
怎么了 先生
Is there something wrong, sir?

13
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,320
你知道怎么了
You know what's wrong.

14
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,940
几乎要上公告栏了
It was practically in the staff bulletin.

15
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,139
疼吗
Did it hurt?

16
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,202
不 那个时候不疼
No, not at the time.

17
00:02:43,716 --> 00:02:44,837
英国人来了

18
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,479
别担心 他们现在都会说法语

19
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,959
你们好
Bonjour.

20
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,079
- 你好 - 你好
- Bonjour. - Bonjour.

21
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:03,716
你们会说英语吗

22
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,580
- 我们的法医们已经开始工作了 - 好
- Our forensic teams are already working. - Sure.

23
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,223
她是被移尸到这的 看这姿势
She's been placed. The posture.

24
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:13,019
- 对 - 腿是在...
- Yes. - And the legs are...

25
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,599
头在法国 而且她是个法国人
Her head is in France and she's French,

26
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,100
所以这是属于法国的案件
so it remains a French investigation.

27
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,448
淡定 琼 我不是来吵架的
Steady on, Joan, I'm not looking for a war over it.

28
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:24,083
我不叫琼
My name is not Joan.

29
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,160
你是说受害人是法国人
Er, you said the victim's French?

30
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:31,639
昨天报道说有个国会议员失踪了 应该就是她
An MP was reported missing yesterday. We think it is her.

31
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,879
那你们认为尸体是怎么运到这的
And how do you think the body was brought here?

32
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,639
我们认为是一辆法国检修车运过来的
We're assuming it must be a French maintenance car.

33
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,279
其中一辆下落不明 司机也失踪了
One of them is unaccounted for and the driver is missing.

34
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,259
好吧 那咱们就等着
All right, well, we'll just wait

35
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,147
确认我们不用管辖...
for confirmation that we're not needed...

36
00:03:43,148 --> 00:03:44,399
我可以确认
I can confirm that.

37
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,566
...听从一个英国长官 然后我们就走
...from a senior British officer, and then we'll be on our way.

38
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,379
我们站在远处 不会打扰的
We'll observe from a distance.

39
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,040
或许能得到一些线索
Maybe we can learn something, eh?

40
00:03:59,076 --> 00:04:00,874
好
All right.

41
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,834
- 他们说什么 - 法国人会拿走尸体
- What did they say? - French have it.

42
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,799
咱们可以撤了
We can go and snuggle under our duvets.

43
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,200
法国人一点也不讲礼貌
No bloody manners, the French.

44
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,762
他们很直接 我很喜欢
They're direct. I quite like that.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,720
我应该去告诉他们一些细节
I should go and give them my details.

46
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:30,120
该死

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,664
# 到我怀里来 #
Venez dans mes bras

48
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,401
# 靠近我 亲爱的 #
Closer to me, dear

49
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,805
# 让我自己 #
Donnez-vous à moi

50
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,503
# 抛开所有恐惧 #
Set aside all fear

51
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,720
# 一根红线 缠绕永远 #
Restons enlaces pour l'éternité

52
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,859
# 是的 你是我的 #
Yes, you shall be mine

53
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:20,171
# 直到地老天荒 #
Till the end of time

54
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:23,006
隧道谜案 第一季第一集

55
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,863
你好
Hello?

56
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:50,377
我是斯蒂芬・布芒特
This is Stephen Beaumont.

57
00:05:50,378 --> 00:05:52,479
我是维拉妮卡・莫伦诺 我一直在等...
This is Veronica Moreno. I've been waiting...

58
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,259
我在法国出差
I had business in France.

59
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,839
我只是... 我们什么时候见面
I just... When can I see you?

60
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,520
一小时之内见
I'll meet you in an hour.

61
00:06:14,477 --> 00:06:15,436
是你吗

62
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,240
是

63
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:20,916
一切都安排好了 我和飞行员说过了

64
00:06:22,075 --> 00:06:24,998
他在办理前往巴哈马的出境许可证

65
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:26,157
好

66
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:28,596
你在哪儿

67
00:06:28,757 --> 00:06:29,957
赶快回家吧

68
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,876
不行 太危险了

69
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:35,684
你让尼古拉斯把黄金卖了吗

70
00:06:35,837 --> 00:06:38,198
是 他将把所有东西放在我名下

71
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,424
好

72
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:42,958
阿兰 亲爱的 告诉我发生了什么

73
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:44,716
告诉我你在哪儿

74
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:47,461
夏洛特

75
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:51,564
他们想要我的命

76
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,517
谁想要你的命

77
00:06:56,524 --> 00:06:57,677
我会尽快打来

78
00:07:16,481 --> 00:07:18,506
那些人想要出卖我们国家

79
00:07:18,534 --> 00:07:21,916
让移民拥有比法国公民更多的权利

80
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:24,637
接受欧盟霸权

81
00:07:24,837 --> 00:07:26,849
施舍别人

82
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:29,957
玛丽・维伦纽夫最后一次在公众露面

83
00:07:30,556 --> 00:07:33,357
宣称对欧洲和移民要增加限制

84
00:07:34,124 --> 00:07:38,324
不到二十四小时 她被绑架 挖空 抛尸

85
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,321
放置于欧洲隧道的中点

86
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:46,197
一辆检修车九时到达法国边界 十时十分离开

87
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:47,681
车辆下落不明

88
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:50,956
司机也是 他叫卢克・维希涅夫斯基

89
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:54,757
进入内部管理隧道需要通过指纹身份系统

90
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,597
- 用的是他注册的指纹 - 监控录像呢

91
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:00,636
只有入口有 但看不清楚

92
00:08:00,836 --> 00:08:01,839
好

93
00:08:02,922 --> 00:08:03,879
谁挖空了她

94
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:05,275
也许他有癖好

95
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:06,643
我不这样想

96
00:08:07,397 --> 00:08:08,517
这样做很明智

97
00:08:09,517 --> 00:08:11,398
易于运送并搬卸尸体

98
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:13,156
否则她的肠子会流出来

99
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:16,638
手法严密 谨慎 干净

100
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,877
步骤需要非常精确

101
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:22,997
一个有条不紊的杀手 至少我们知道了这个

102
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:25,838
不 这是个麻烦

103
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,640
嘿 亚当
Hey, Adam.

104
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,079
- 你抓到他们了吗 - 谁
- Did you catch them? - Who?

105
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,518
- 那些坏蛋 - 还没
- The bad guys. - Not yet.

106
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,399
还疼吗
Does it still hurt?

107
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,639
是的
Yeah.

108
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,599
你和亚当说了让他多帮些忙吗
Did you speak to Adam about helping out more?

109
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,380
他睡了
He's asleep.

110
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:29,718
抱歉 我没等你就开始了

111
00:10:35,563 --> 00:10:36,636
想看一下吗

112
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:38,916
这案子很有趣

113
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:42,516
记住我教给你的

114
00:10:47,318 --> 00:10:49,236
嘴唇和耳朵轻微发紫

115
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,678
多处点状出血

116
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:55,036
皮下有斑点

117
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,637
窒息而死

118
00:10:58,278 --> 00:10:59,278
很好

119
00:10:59,877 --> 00:11:01,357
死后被切成两半

120
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:03,801
去看看腿

121
00:11:21,357 --> 00:11:22,918
肤色不同

122
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:25,798
有两个死者

123
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:34,196
她是英国人

124
00:11:34,883 --> 00:11:36,404
或是威尔士人 这是威尔士国旗

125
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:42,637
这处褪色是什么

126
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:44,477
好样的

127
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:46,637
原以为你会忽略它

128
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:50,117
腿部被冷冻过

129
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:52,917
冻了多久

130
00:11:53,517 --> 00:11:54,556
至少六个月

131
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:01,640
这是蓄谋已久的

132
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,844
你是慈善机构来的吗
Are you from the charity?

133
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,925
我朋友说你会帮我们
My friend said you would help us.

134
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,619
他们拒绝了你的庇护要求
They've denied your asylum claim?

135
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,559
我全家人都被杀了 凶手是...
My whole family, they were murdered by...

136
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,437
我不是上诉委员会
I'm not the appeal panel.

137
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:56,573
我只是想知道目前的状况
I'm just establishing the present situation.

138
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,119
我不能回哥伦比亚
I cannot go back to Colombia.

139
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,140
我们慈善机构有个宿舍 你可以待段时间
Our charity has a hostel where you can stay for a short time.

140
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,519
然后我们会考虑不同方案
Then we'll consider the options.

141
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:12,542
跟我来
Come with me.

142
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,380
给我十块钱 斯蒂芬
Suck you off for a tenner, Stephen!

143
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,400
坦妮娅...
Tania...

144
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,099
喝点汤去 别买海洛因
Soup, not smack.

145
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:52,652
{\an8}被害人一

146
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:55,656
{\an8}被害人二

147
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,771
你好
Yeah?

148
00:14:16,843 --> 00:14:18,883
是卡尔・罗巴克吗
Am I speaking to Karl Roebuck?

149
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:20,470
是的
Yeah.

150
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:23,194
法国警察爱丽丝・瓦塞尔曼 咱们昨天见过
Elise Wassermann, French police, we met yesterday.

151
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,478
昨天
Yesterday?

152
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,503
不 我不喜欢果酱
No, I don't like marmalade.

153
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,459
笑什么
What is it?

154
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,141
我老婆在说梦话
My wife is talking in her sleep.

155
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:39,394
她刚刚说"我不喜欢果酱"
She just said, "I don't like marmalade."

156
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:41,199
她喜欢果酱吗
Does she like marmalade?

157
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,035
我觉得她喜欢
Well, I thought she did.

158
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,759
很奇怪
That's strange, then.

159
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,900
我想告诉你最新的情况
I wanted to update you.

160
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,699
那应该是你的案子吧
I thought this was your case now.

161
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,839
下半身是另外一个女人的
The lower half of the body belonged to another woman.

162
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,719
还是个英国人
We believe she was British.

163
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,059
为什么
Why?

164
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,699
一个纹身 上面有英国和威尔士国旗
A tattoo. With a Union Jack and the flag of Wales.

165
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,639
还写着"我爱你 妈妈"
And the words, "I love you, Mum."

166
00:14:58,674 --> 00:15:01,919
所有你要查出有那样纹身的失踪威尔士女孩
So you need to check out missing Welsh girls with that tattoo.

167
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,083
好 一上班我就打给你
Right, I'll call you as soon as I'm on duty.

168
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:06,459
我需要有人马上能做这件事
Then I need the name of somebody who can do it now.

169
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,217
你考虑过从事外交工作吗
Have you ever considered a career in the diplomatic service?

170
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:15,597
没有
No.

171
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:18,370
如果有进一步的消息请尽快通知我
Please call me as soon as you have any information.

172
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,360
人真多
Plenty of 'em.

173
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,380
等等
Hold on.

174
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,738
吉玛・柯万
So, Gemma Kirwan.

175
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,556
混血
Mixed race.

176
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,754
格兰奇镇 卡迪夫市
Grangetown, Cardiff.

177
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,949
七个月前其母亲报警称其失踪
Reported missing by her mother seven months ago.

178
00:16:19,675 --> 00:16:23,157
我找到了维伦纽夫的调查员 吉尔斯・里加

179
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,038
她生前见到的最后一个人

180
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:26,444
- 他在哪儿 - 马赛

181
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:29,639
他开会后去的那里 随后来警局接受传唤

182
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:36,276
我的新女友也来自马赛

183
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:38,443
- 你有女朋友了 - 是啊

184
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:42,837
我们上床的时候

185
00:16:42,996 --> 00:16:45,077
她坚持要戴上手铐

186
00:16:46,157 --> 00:16:48,635
我不喜欢这样 感觉跟上班一样

187
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:50,242
别告诉爱丽丝

188
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:53,236
- 她会想加入 - 没错

189
00:16:53,436 --> 00:16:55,678
她会告你挪用警用资源

190
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:06,600
菲利普交了新女友

191
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:07,836
她来自马赛

192
00:17:29,397 --> 00:17:31,716
需要正式命令你才能回家吗

193
00:17:35,677 --> 00:17:38,199
英国人认为他们已确定第二具尸体的身份

194
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:43,076
他们想要DNA样本 罗巴克探长正在赶来

195
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,117
他不靠谱

196
00:17:47,438 --> 00:17:51,075
现在是英法联合调查 我们别无选择

197
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,756
对他友善些

198
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,579
请确保您的手刹已拉起
Please ensure that your handbrake is on

199
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,459
并且档位在一档或停车档
and your vehicle is in first gear or park.

200
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,959
为了您的安全与舒适
For your safety and comfort,

201
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,179
我们建议您待在您的车中
we recommend that you stay with your vehicle.

202
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,928
不要在穿越过程中走出车辆
Do not stand or walk between the vehicles during the crossing.

203
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,299
我给你留了一些食品券和其他生活用品
I left some food vouchers and a few other bits to help you get by,

204
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,940
在我给你找到更长久的解决方案之前暂且如此
until I find a more permanent solution for you.

205
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,659
如果你想了解这个国家的民众心理
You should read this,

206
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,580
我该看看这个
if you want to know about the mentality of this country.

207
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,017
记录一下而已 我喜欢记住我帮助过的人
For my records. I like to remember the people I help.

208
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,479
那条路方向不对 咱不去那儿
That's the deviation. We're not going there.

209
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,619
方向不对
That's the deviation.

210
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,959
那是去汽车轮渡的路 咱不去那儿
That's going to the car ferry. We're not going there.

211
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,919
这条路是去...
This is going to...

212
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,809
汽车轮渡
the car ferry.

213
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:39,772
该死
Oh, bollocks!

214
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,999
这是到哪了
Where are we?

215
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,129
不好意思 抱歉
Pardon. Sorry.

216
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:46,320
是 是 是 抱歉
All right. Oui, oui, oui. Pardon.

217
00:21:10,596 --> 00:21:11,637
打扰一下

218
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,522
瓦塞尔曼警长在哪
Uh... Capitaine Wassermann?

219
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:17,244
瓦塞尔曼警长 不在这层

220
00:21:17,395 --> 00:21:18,676
去一层看看

221
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:19,918
你会说英语吗

222
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,622
这里是... 三楼
This is...third floor.

223
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,559
她在一楼
She is on first floor.

224
00:21:25,594 --> 00:21:26,796
一楼
First floor. Okay. Oui.

225
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:29,299
- 你得下楼找她 - 好的 非常感谢
- You have to go down. - Down. Merci beaucoup.

226
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:30,359
来一个羊角面包吗?
Vous voulez un croissant?

227
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,639
- 不用 谢谢 - 不吃
- Non, merci. - No?

228
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,319
你在减肥吗
Are you on a diet?

229
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,160
- 不是 - 真的不吃 好吧
- No. - No? Good.

230
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,120
大家好
Bonjour.

231
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,119
近来如何
Comment allez-vous?

232
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,519
告诉我这个失踪女孩的个人情况
So, tell me about this missing girl.

233
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,585
吉玛・柯万 二十三岁
Gemma Kirwan, aged 23,

234
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:01,839
七个月前失踪于福克斯顿市
disappeared from Folkestone seven months ago.

235
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,419
我以为她是威尔士人
I thought she was Welsh.

236
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,119
人就是这样 不喜欢一直待在一个地方
That's the trouble with people. They won't stay in one place.

237
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,559
就她的职业来看 我们的数据库里
Given her profession, it's highly likely we've got her

238
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,959
很可能有她的DNA信息
DNA on our database.

239
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,519
就她的职业来看 当初你们警方也很可能
And given her profession, it's also likely

240
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,100
没怎么努力去找过她
not much effort was made to find her.

241
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,514
但她们行踪不定
Well, they're a transient bunch.

242
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,779
我想法国应该也有些失踪妓女
I imagine there's a few French prostitutes

243
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,599
没被仔细调查过
who haven't been searched for too carefully either.

244
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,259
- 是的 可能是的 - 是啊...
- Yes, that is probably correct. - Yes...

245
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,679
我还在术后恢复阶段
I'm recovering from an operation.

246
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,120
结扎手术
The snip.

247
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,199
什么
The what?

248
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,580
结扎手术
La vasectomie.

249
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,080
显然比生孩子还要痛
More painful than childbirth, apparently.

250
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,999
你有孩子吗
You got kids?

251
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,379
这个世界上的孩子够多了
There are enough kids in this world.

252
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,680
我有五个
I've got five.

253
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,879
但是分别由三任妻子生的
Three different mums, though.

254
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,559
那结扎也许是个好主意
A vasectomy was probably a good idea, then.

255
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,840
- 别动那个 - 这不是你 对吧
- Don't touch that! - It's not you, is it?

256
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,402
- 你怎么知道的 - 首先 她在笑
- How do you know? - She's smiling, for one thing.

257
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,459
其次 没有人会在办公桌上放自己照片
No one keeps a picture of themselves on their desk.

258
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,300
你们是双胞胎
You're a twin.

259
00:23:20,084 --> 00:23:21,677
检修车找到了

260
00:23:21,836 --> 00:23:23,480
- 在哪儿 - 终点站后面

261
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,557
- 司机呢 - 下落不明

262
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,259
这车不错
Nice car.

263
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,880
是的 我挺喜欢的
Yes, I like it.

264
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,600
很好
Good.

265
00:23:57,997 --> 00:23:59,002
打扰一下

266
00:24:10,436 --> 00:24:13,255
我想他把尸体的其他部分丢在了别的地方
I suppose we assume he's dumped the rest of the body elsewhere.

267
00:24:13,256 --> 00:24:14,536
他在玩我们
He's taunting us.

268
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,157
我们拿到了维伦纽夫的通话记录

269
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:21,803
一个人打了许多次 叫夏洛特・鲁伯特

270
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:26,356
还有一条威胁短信"离我丈夫远点"

271
00:24:27,436 --> 00:24:29,436
- 她是阿兰・鲁伯特的妻子 - 是的

272
00:24:29,596 --> 00:24:30,917
他们住在布伦附近

273
00:24:31,757 --> 00:24:32,798
我去一趟

274
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:35,133
回见
Oh, moi aussi.

275
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:39,836
在西班牙 成百上千的人们在游行

276
00:24:39,996 --> 00:24:43,242
抗议政府的紧缩政策

277
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,317
需要打扫吗

278
00:24:52,516 --> 00:24:53,556
好 谢谢

279
00:24:59,156 --> 00:25:00,799
一位警方发言人说

280
00:25:00,955 --> 00:25:05,356
抗议者态度强硬 寻求有力解决措施

281
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,797
欧洲人的梦想啊

282
00:25:11,717 --> 00:25:13,283
很快就会爆发冲突了

283
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:17,197
暴乱什么也改变不了

284
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:20,040
总有人要为此买单

285
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:23,402
您还需要什么吗

286
00:25:23,402 --> 00:25:27,677
- 你有手机吗 - 有

287
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:33,517
我的手机被偷了 需要打给我妻子

288
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,308
谁是阿兰・鲁伯特
Who is Alain Joubert?

289
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:54,527
是我们国家的著名金融家
One of our leading financiers...

290
00:25:55,276 --> 00:25:58,845
也是上一任政府财政紧缩政策的顾问
and an adviser on austerity measures to the last government.

291
00:25:59,496 --> 00:26:01,152
他不太受欢迎
He is not popular.

292
00:26:01,187 --> 00:26:03,835
真的吗 怎么会
Really? How come?

293
00:26:03,836 --> 00:26:05,715
他靠经济危机大赚了一笔
The crisis made him even richer.

294
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:07,056
我开玩笑的
I was joking.

295
00:26:08,696 --> 00:26:10,115
是的 我知道
Yes, I got that.

296
00:26:10,116 --> 00:26:12,116
你不太喜欢笑话 是不是
You're not really one for jokes, are you?

297
00:26:13,716 --> 00:26:17,062
有时是 看这笑话好不好笑
Sometimes. It depends if they're funny.

298
00:26:22,236 --> 00:26:25,555
英国人很注重幽默
The British place a lot of value on humour.

299
00:26:25,556 --> 00:26:29,175
这有时会让你们因此忽视更重要的事
Sometimes it makes you lose sight of things that are more important.

300
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:31,935
这只是我的观点
That is just my opinion,

301
00:26:31,936 --> 00:26:33,395
无意冒犯
I'm not trying to offend you.

302
00:26:33,396 --> 00:26:34,996
没事 我知道
No, sure.

303
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:38,035
我以后会找机会和你谈谈
I'll bring you up to speed

304
00:26:38,036 --> 00:26:41,075
我眼中法国人的缺点
with my assessment of French national defects later.

305
00:26:41,076 --> 00:26:44,156
那我会洗耳恭听
I'd be interested to hear your views.

306
00:26:58,637 --> 00:26:59,757
阿兰 是你吗

307
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,436
是

308
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:04,476
你知道加莱的战争纪念馆在哪儿吗

309
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:08,076
- 是的 - 去那里找我

310
00:27:08,236 --> 00:27:09,438
好 我会去的

311
00:27:09,597 --> 00:27:12,197
- 现在就来 - 好 我马上出发

312
00:27:20,562 --> 00:27:22,196
- 鲁伯特夫人 - 我是

313
00:27:23,156 --> 00:27:25,236
我是刑侦大队的爱丽丝・瓦塞尔曼

314
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:26,796
这是英国警察卡尔・罗巴克

315
00:27:28,516 --> 00:27:29,759
好

316
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,436
什么事

317
00:27:31,596 --> 00:27:35,077
关于玛丽・维伦纽夫 你给她发了条威胁短信

318
00:27:36,476 --> 00:27:37,956
她起诉我了吗

319
00:27:39,597 --> 00:27:40,598
你会讲英语吗

320
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:43,995
抱歉 我的法语不太好
Sorry, my French is very poor.

321
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,995
但我还是在努力学
I'm working on it, though.

322
00:27:46,595 --> 00:27:48,079
你觉得玛丽・维伦纽夫和你丈夫之间
Did you think there was something going on

323
00:27:48,117 --> 00:27:50,040
有发生过什么事吗
between Marie Villeneuve and your husband?

324
00:27:50,456 --> 00:27:55,018
不 她在演讲中抨击了他
No. No, she was attacking him in her speeches.

325
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:56,915
听着我现在真的没有时间

326
00:27:57,014 --> 00:27:59,984
我们能下次再谈吗
Can't we... this wait until another time?

327
00:27:59,996 --> 00:28:02,036
恐怕不行 请进屋吧
I insist. Please go inside.

328
00:28:09,316 --> 00:28:11,282
你知道玛丽・维伦纽夫失踪了吗
Are you aware that Marie Villeneuve is missing?

329
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:12,594
不知道
No.

330
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,915
现在真的不行 请让我走吧
Please, I can't do this now. Please, let me go.

331
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:17,275
请坐下
Sit down, please.

332
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:20,115
听着 我必须去见我丈夫 他压力很大
Listen. I have to go and see my husband. He's very stressed.

333
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:23,316
很可能会自杀 拜托了
He might be suicidal. Please.

334
00:28:24,116 --> 00:28:25,637
坐下 鲁伯特女士

335
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,404
听着 你这个不可理喻的人

336
00:28:29,597 --> 00:28:32,604
你认为你可以闯入这里对我发号施令

337
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:35,756
坐下 鲁伯特女士

338
00:28:38,336 --> 00:28:39,756
求你了
Please.

339
00:28:41,076 --> 00:28:43,415
我保证会去找你们谈的
I promise I will come and talk to you.

340
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:45,115
真的没什么
This is nothing.

341
00:28:45,116 --> 00:28:47,015
我和玛丽上学时就认识了
I knew Marie from school.

342
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,595
她把我丈夫当成政治皮球 利用了他
She started using my husband as a political football,

343
00:28:49,596 --> 00:28:51,375
所以我打电话给她让她停止这一切
so I called her to ask her to stop.

344
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:55,382
她没接 我才给她发了短信 拜托了
I texted, because she wouldn't answer. Please.

345
00:28:57,116 --> 00:29:00,755
我保证会带着律师去警局见你们的
I promise I will come and report to the police station with a lawyer.

346
00:29:02,757 --> 00:29:04,036
塞西尔 我一会儿给你回电话

347
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:06,196
什么

348
00:29:08,358 --> 00:29:09,476
等一下 我听不见

349
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:23,835
谢谢 非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you very much.

350
00:29:23,836 --> 00:29:26,156
我保证会在车上给我的律师打电话的
I promise I will call my lawyer from the car.

351
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:29,316
请一定要打 否则我会有麻烦的
Please do, or I'll be in trouble.

352
00:29:34,636 --> 00:29:36,276
没准已经有麻烦了
I may be already.

353
00:29:36,637 --> 00:29:37,876
让奥利弗去协调

354
00:29:52,316 --> 00:29:54,035
你让她走了
You let her go.

355
00:29:54,036 --> 00:29:55,976
是的
Er, yeah.

356
00:29:58,356 --> 00:30:01,395
我不明白你为什么这么做
I don't understand why you would do that.

357
00:30:01,396 --> 00:30:03,956
我想这不是主要问题
No, I think that's part of the problem.

358
00:30:05,936 --> 00:30:07,995
我才是首席探员
I am the lead investigator.

359
00:30:07,996 --> 00:30:09,915
听着
Now, listen.

360
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:13,115
那个女人非常焦虑 担心他的丈夫...
That woman was acutely distressed, frightened for her husband...

361
00:30:13,116 --> 00:30:14,895
这是谋杀调查
This is a murder investigation.

362
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,718
但她并不知道 而且她的解释也完全合理
But she didn't know that. And her explanation was entirely plausible.

363
00:30:18,796 --> 00:30:21,355
你也许觉得我有些讨厌
You might find my manner a little annoying,

364
00:30:21,356 --> 00:30:23,315
太多笑话 讲话随意 诸如此类...
too many random jokes, conversations, whatever...

365
00:30:23,316 --> 00:30:24,755
我没说过我讨厌
I didn't say I found it annoying.

366
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:27,255
但是我当警察已经很久了
But I have been a policeman for quite a long time,

367
00:30:27,256 --> 00:30:29,895
而且我觉得干的还不错
and I like to think a good one,

368
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:32,435
我知道什么时候询问别人是不适宜的
and I know when it's an inappropriate time to question someone

369
00:30:32,436 --> 00:30:35,296
什么时候可以适当灵活些
and when it's time to show a little flexibility.

370
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:46,817
{\an8}战争纪念馆 1939-1945

371
00:31:02,197 --> 00:31:03,396
我很想你

372
00:31:09,716 --> 00:31:11,317
这是黄金的文书

373
00:31:11,476 --> 00:31:14,716
飞行许可通过了 我们明天就可以离开

374
00:31:15,561 --> 00:31:16,557
谢谢

375
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:19,119
我自己走

376
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:20,920
为什么

377
00:31:21,557 --> 00:31:24,316
你不能离开我 我什么时候跟你会合

378
00:31:24,998 --> 00:31:26,436
我不能把你牵涉进来

379
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,196
但是我已经被牵涉进来了

380
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,795
我是你妻子

381
00:31:34,116 --> 00:31:35,597
你是我拥有的一切

382
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:39,043
这正是你想要的

383
00:31:41,077 --> 00:31:42,399
都结束了 Charlotte

384
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,077
我不再爱你了

385
00:31:45,997 --> 00:31:47,196
已经很久了

386
00:31:49,197 --> 00:31:51,161
我做了一切你要我做的

387
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,156
是的

388
00:32:02,957 --> 00:32:04,239
这不公平

389
00:32:06,796 --> 00:32:07,997
照顾好自己

390
00:32:14,924 --> 00:32:16,876
爱丽丝 你要我怎么做

391
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:18,916
失踪的司机已经不是嫌疑人了

392
00:32:19,081 --> 00:32:21,356
我们不知道凶手是英国人还是法国人

393
00:32:21,477 --> 00:32:23,801
- 我不能跟英国人说 - 他放走了个证人

394
00:32:26,996 --> 00:32:28,597
好吧 这个决定不合常规

395
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:32,639
但夏洛特・鲁伯特遵守了承诺

396
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,157
她的律师说她会来的

397
00:32:34,356 --> 00:32:36,316
这跟她没关系

398
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:39,356
你要知道不是所有人都和你的做法一样

399
00:32:39,518 --> 00:32:41,402
依法办事是必须的

400
00:32:41,557 --> 00:32:43,718
那是指

401
00:32:58,816 --> 00:33:00,716
等等我
Wait for me!

402
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:09,655
和你的法国同仁怎么样
How's it all going with your French counterpart?

403
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:11,195
还不错...
Yeah...

404
00:33:11,196 --> 00:33:15,215
很多法式作风 低调又性感
Lots of Gallic style? Understated, yet sexy?

405
00:33:15,216 --> 00:33:16,315
爱丽丝
Elise?

406
00:33:16,316 --> 00:33:19,075
开花耳朵 很胖
Cauliflower ears. Very fat.

407
00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:20,155
{\an8}法国英雄

408
00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:20,155
就像奥贝里克斯
Looks a bit like Obelix.

409
00:33:20,156 --> 00:33:24,175
我就当是了 别伸出你的魔爪哦 坏家伙
I'll take that as a yes! Paws off, buster!

410
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:26,135
说真的 她像被灌了魔法药水
Seriously, she fell in the magic potion,

411
00:33:26,136 --> 00:33:29,595
非但没给她力量 还夺走了她所有的社交能力
but instead of giving her strength, it took away all her social skills.

412
00:33:36,896 --> 00:33:38,956
对亚当来说我不是个好父亲
I was a bad dad to Adam.

413
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:43,776
你不是一个坏父亲 你只是没在他身边
You weren't a bad dad, you just weren't there.

414
00:33:45,676 --> 00:33:48,169
- 爸爸 - 爸爸
- Daddy! - Daddy!

415
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,719
嗨 我想搭个便车顺便帮你指路
Hi, thought I'd hitch a ride and give you directions.

416
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,179
我有导航仪
I have a sat nav.

417
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,239
很现代化嘛
Ah, très moderne!

418
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,456
我更青睐地图
I prefer maps.

419
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,640
记住 我们在左侧行驶
Remember, we drive on the left.

420
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,599
我们找到了检修车司机
We've found the maintenance driver.

421
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,659
被海水冲到了沙滩上
Washed up on a beach.

422
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,160
好吧
Okay.

423
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,480
- 你还在不高兴吗 - 不
- You still sulking? - No.

424
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,839
我还在生气
I'm still angry.

425
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,760
- 想掰手腕一决胜负吗 - 不想
- Want an arm wrestle? - No.

426
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,620
长官命令我必须和你一起工作
I've been told I have to work with you.

427
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,540
好的
Okay.

428
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,183
那我们开始工作吧
Let's go to work, then.

429
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,480
你在发推特吗
You on Twitter or something?

430
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,697
- 怎么了 - 你在写什么
- So? - What are you writing?

431
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,759
"我的天啊 猜猜我刚才跟谁睡了 大笑"
"OMG, guess who I just fucked? LOL."

432
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,999
是的 我还说你狂妄自大 老二很小
Yeah. I also said you had a massive ego and a tiny cock.

433
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,279
前者倒是真的 后者就有些刻薄了
Well, the first's true. The second's a bit harsh.

434
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,879
也许小于平均值 但是 谁在乎呢
Smaller than average, maybe, but, who cares,

435
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,099
还是有大把漂亮的蠢女孩愿意舔它们
if I can still get stupid, pretty girls to let me come in their mouths?

436
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,779
你真的可以吗 没发现
Did you really? I never noticed.

437
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,439
再说 我跟着你是为了毒品
I was only after you for your drugs, anyway.

438
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,819
好吧 如果你愿意 可以在出去时舔舔包装纸
All right, well, you can lick the wrap on the way out if you like.

439
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,539
不 你不能改变那该死的截稿时间
No, you can't change the fucking deadline.

440
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,559
那告诉那些侏儒们别修改我的文章
Then tell the pygmies not to change my copy.

441
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,399
这是篇精打细磨的辩论文 不是什么意见表
It's a finely-honed polemic, not a suggestion sheet.

442
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,679
怪就怪这个时代吧 老朋友
Blame the times, old son.

443
