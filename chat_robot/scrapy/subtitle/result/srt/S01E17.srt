00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:03,336
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯 前情提要
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis</i>

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:05,213
它正冲城市飞去!
It's headed for the city !

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,673
- 它在干什么?
- 扫描我们 ..
- What's it doing ?
- Scanning us ..

4
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:11,469
那艘飞船已经向宇宙深处
传送了一些信号
Now the dart sent a transmission deep into space,

5
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,387
然后在我们可以靠近的时候自毁了
and then it self destructed before we could get to it.

6
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:16,349
- 已经用我们的深空探测器扫描了那片区域..
- 那些是什么?
- We scanned the area with our deep-space sensors and..
- What are those ?

7
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,434
幽灵的母船 一共有三艘
Wraith hives ship. Three of them.

8
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,268
它们飞向哪里?
Where are they headed ?

9
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,688
如果保持现在的方向和速度
三周后它们将会到达我们的星球
If they maintain direction and speed,
they'll be over our planet within two weeks.

10
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,366
我们已经知道他们要来了
至少现在知道了它们何时会来
We knew they were comming,
at least now we know when.

11
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:35,284
- 一定有办法
- 有办法?
- That's something.
- That's something ?

12
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:38,579
我们还有时间, Rodney.
现在没有理由恐慌
There's still time, Rodney.
There's no reason to panic...

13
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,916
只要还有时间, 就一定会有希望
- yet.
- Where there is time, there is hope.

14
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,835
同意 有什么建议?
Agreed. So recommandations ?

15
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:47,046
- 除了恐慌之外?
- 除了恐慌, 是的!
- Other than panic ?
- Other than panic, yes!

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,051
我知道这可能不是很好
不过我们可以考虑 M7G-677...
I realize this might not be cool,
but we should consider M7G-677.

17
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:54,804
- 作为一个可能的疏散点?
- 不, 女士
- As a possible evacuation site ?
- No ma'am.

18
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,515
我建议我们取走他们的ZPM
I'm suggesting we take their ZPM.

19
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,642
他们唯一防护幽灵的途径?
Their only means of protection from the Wraith ?

20
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,895
一个大部分由孩子居住的星球
A planet populated mostly by children.

21
00:01:03,312 --> 00:01:09,151
他的观点是有根据的
我们已经确定了那个ZPM已经快枯竭了
不过对我们可能还有些用
He raises a valid point. We've already
established the ZPM is nearly depleted,
but it could be of some limited use to us.

22
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:12,113
你刚才让我们提建议
这是我们生存下来的一种方法
You asked for suggestions. It's a matter of survival.

23
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:13,573
我知道了
I see.

24
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:19,078
我们还没有走到那一步
只要我还在掌管这里, 我们永远也不会去那里
We're not quite there yet.
And as long as I'm in charge, we will never be there.

25
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,580
我同意Weir博士的观点
I agree doctor Weir.

26
00:01:20,621 --> 00:01:24,625
即便这就是我们的结局
我们也应该体面的应对它
If this is to be our end, it is best
we face it with both dignity and honor.

27
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:28,129
- 实际上我有一个想法, 除了恐慌之外
- 说出来听听
- To that end I actually have an idea, in addition, to panic.
- Let's hear it.

28
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,467
虽然比较繁琐, 不过我想还是值得的
当然, 大部分要归功于我的...
It's really a long shot, but I think it's most likely
worth the effort, of course the most to be my efforts...

29
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:34,719
到底是什么?
What is it ?

30
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:38,389
我想我们可以通过星际之门
给地球发回一条消息
I think we can send a message
back to Earth through the Stargate.

31
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:40,808
- 抱歉?
- 我想我们没有足够的能量
- Excuse me ?
- I thought we didn't have enough power.

32
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:44,353
对于传送一个人来说, 确实不够
我们没有办法让虫洞维持足够长的时间
Not to send a person, no. We'd never be
able to maintain the wormhole long enough.

33
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,690
不过我想如果我们把所有可以用的
能源集中到一起
But I think if we would be able to tie together
all of our power generating capabilities,

34
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:52,486
我们可能, 我强调的一下, 是可能
建立一个足够久的虫洞并发送一条消息
we might - and I emphasise might - be able to establish
a wormhole long enough to send a message.

35
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:54,030
大概是多长时间?
How much time are we talking about ?

36
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,408
大约, 1.3 秒, 发送或者接收
Aproximatly, 1.3 seconds, give or take.

37
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,828
- 这时间不够
- 只够喊SOS了
- That's not much time.
- Time enough to say S.O.S.

38
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:06,709
不是用模拟方式
如果需要发送的消息是经过了高度压缩的
1.3秒完全足够了
Don't be so analogue. 1.3 seconds is
more than enough time to send the message
if it's in the form of a high compression data burst.

39
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,670
几年前, 我曾经帮助美国空军
优化过编码算法
Now, I helped refine the encoding
for the US Air Force a few years back.

40
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:14,217
- Carter上校在那边应该知道如何解密
- 你建议我们现在就开始干?
- Colonel Carter should be able to decipher it on the other side.
- You're suggesting this now ?

41
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:18,638
因为它可能不会成功, 而且很有可能
在进行当中会让我们的发电机过载
Because it probably won't work, and there's
a very good chance it could overload
our naquadah generators in the process.

42
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,640
好啊, 那我们就不应该去冒这个险!
Well then we can't take the risk !

43
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,434
没有能量, 我们就没有任何机会了
No power, we won't have a chance in hell.

44
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:28,814
有三艘幽灵的母船正朝这里飞来, 少校
非常时候就应该采取非常措施
There are three Wraith hives ship on the way, Major.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

45
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:32,109
除此之外, 我过去几天一直在想办法
尽量让失败的可能性降到最低
Besides, I spent the last few days
working of ways of minimizing the risk.

46
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:37,615
假如这是可能的, 我们可以发送多少信息?
Assuming it's possible, how much information can we send ?

47
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:43,955
任何东西 亚特兰蒂斯所有资深组员的
任务报告, 所有我们在飞马座学到的东西
Everything. I mean, mission reports from all
the senior staff, a ton of stuff on Atlantis,
things we've learned in Pegasus.

48
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:47,166
- 所有的? 一秒钟?
- 一点三秒
- All that ? One second ?
- One point three.

49
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:51,754
我还可以更加优化压缩比率
你们会找着东西来加进去的
You jest, but if I could finesse the compression
ratios, you'll be looking for things to add.

50
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:59,011
- 做吧
- 就开始
- Do it.
- Doing it.

51
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:18,322
Elizabeth, 你应该知道
如果星际之门的指挥官能够发出求救信号...
Elizabeth, you realize that if
Stargate Command was able to send help..

52
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:23,286
我知道 不过我们仍然有责任报告
我们在这里学习到的东西
I know. They would have. But still we've the
responsability to report what we've learned here.

53
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,289
- 关于亚特兰蒂斯, 关于古人...
- 幽灵?
- About Atlantis, about the Ancients..
- The Wraith ?

54
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:28,791
是的, 我们必须提醒地球
Exactly. We have to warn Earth.

55
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,793
即使这是我们所做的最后一件事?
Even if it's the last thing we do ?

56
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:33,087
如果是最后一件事, 那就尤其如此
Especially if it's the last thing we do.

57
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:33,013
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季第17集 飞马座来信
Season 1 : Episode 17
Letters from Pegasus

58
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,448
那些屏幕上的小点,
它们看起来并不危险, 是不是?
They don't seem threatening,
those dots on the screen, do they?

59
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,451
这就是为什么我们要去实地侦察
去获取第一手的资料
Which is why we need to do recon and
see what we're up against firsthand.

60
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,911
怎样去?
How ?

61
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:52,041
我已经跟踪了它们的行进路线
幽灵的飞船很显然会周期性的进出超空间
I've been tracking their progress. The Wraith ships
apparently go in and out of hyperspace periodically.

62
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:57,880
- 要么是它们关于超空间的技术十分有限....
- 要么是它们在沿路洗劫
- Either because their hyperspace technology is limited....
- Or they're stopping to feed along the way.

63
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,508
重要的是, 这种行进模式是可以预测的
The point is, the pattern is predictable.

64
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:06,806
我可以断定, 它们会在
这里,  这里和这里停一下
I can guess with some certainty, that
they'll be making stops, here, here and here.

65
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:11,185
即便是这样, 这些飞船仍然在数光年以外
我们如何让我们的小飞船去接近它们?
Even so, those ships are light years away. How
do you expect to reach them in a puddle jumper?

66
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:16,816
我们可以飞到一个途中的星际之门
Zelenka认为它们会在那里脱离超空间
然后就在旁边观察它们
We fly to a Stargate en route that Zelenka thinks they're
gonna drop out of hyperspace, and we watch them pass by.

67
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,111
- 不错
- 你知道我已经准备好了
- That's good.
- You know I have my moments.

68
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,822
我和Teyla刚才已经决定了将去哪个星球
Teyla and I were just deciding which planet to go to.

69
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,867
我跟这个星球上的人们很熟
I am familiar with the people of this world.

70
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:30,037
他们的星际之门处于开放状态
可以通过一艘飞船
Their Stargate is in the open,
and so, accessible by ship.

71
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,749
你确信在幽灵经过你们的时候
不会被发现?
And you think you can remain undetected
by the Wraith as they go by your position?

72
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,960
隐形模式
它们甚至不知道我们在那里
Stealth mode. They won't even know we're there.

73
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:42,341
好吧, 去吧, 尽可能多的获取信息
记得在Rodney发送消息前回来
我要你们两个都回到这里
OK, go. Get what intel you can and get back before
Rodney sends his message. I need the both of you here.

74
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,051
在任务完成前, 我们是不会停下的
Won't even stop at the duty free.

75
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:14,373
千万不要试图去和幽灵的飞船交火
我在这里命令你, 不要这样做
On the offchance that you get the idea to take the Wraith
ships on yourself Major. I am hereby ordering you not to.

76
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,791
相信我, 不会的
Believe me you don't have to.

77
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:16,584
再强调一次
<i>Still.</i>

78
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:22,048
"不要只身赤手空拳与敌舰搏斗"
我明白
"Don't take on alien armada's single handedly."
I understand.

79
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,816
父亲! Teyla来了!
Father! Teyla's here!

80
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,870
Teyla!
Teyla!

81
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:59,293
- Oren! 好久不见了
- 很久了, 瞧你, 变了许多
- Oren! It has been many days.
- Too many. Look at you, you're so different.

82
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,004
自从我上次拜访之后
很多东西都发生了改变
Much has changed since my last visit.

83
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:08,427
- 这位是John Sheppard少校. 这是Oren
- 很高兴见到你
- This is Major John Sheppard. And Oren.
- Pleased to meet you.

84
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,558
- 现在离收获还有好几个月
- 是的, 我知道
- The harvest is still months away.
- Yes, I know.

85
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,186
我们到这里来不是为了交易
我们是来提醒你们
We have not come to trade, but to deliver a warning.

86
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,731
我们有理由相信幽灵已经在路上
We have reason to believe
the Wraith may be on their way.

87
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,068
我们无法确信
不过我们就要去搞清楚
We don't know that for a fact,
but we're about to go and find out.

88
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,947
是的, 看起来它们正在到处醒来
Yes, it seems they're awakening everywhere.

89
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,992
你应该告诉你的人民
做好防范它们到来的措施
You should tell your people
to take precautions in case they do come.

90
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,159
我会的
I will.

91
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:39,667
不过你也知道, Teyla, 无论你去哪里
它们都有办法找到. 逃不掉的
But you know as well as I do Teyla, that the Wraith will
track us down wherever we go. There will be no escape.

92
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,210
那么通过星际之门呢?
What about through the Stargate?

93
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,047
洗劫会在很多个星球上发生
没有地方是安全的
The cullings are taking place
on many worlds. None are safe.

94
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,050
即便是我们找到了避难所
Even we have taken in refugees.

95
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:56,392
如果他们真的来了, 尽量离星际之门远点
带你的家人到树林的边缘, 那里, 等着我们
If they do come, stay far from the Stargate. Take
your family to the far treeline, there, and wait for us.

96
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,979
- Teyla.
- 一个家庭, 少校, 这就是我的全部要求
- Teyla.
- One family Major, that is all I ask.

97
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:08,070
我很抱歉Oren, 我不能保证
I'm sorry Oren, I can't make that promise.

98
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,031
至少, 这是我们可以做到的
It will be the very least we can do.

99
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,329
- 如果有时间的话
- 那我们就必须赶紧
- If there's time.
- Then we must hurry.

100
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,757
孩子们, 我们必须做好准备
Children, we must prepare.

101
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,554
好了, 我们已经准备好了城市的布局图,
任务报告以及作战评估
Alright, we have our city' specs, mission reports
and tactical assessments all ready to go.

102
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,515
还有什么?
What else ?

103
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,477
我已经附上了一大堆我们所能够解密的
来自古人数据库的数据
Well I've included a ton of data that we've been
able to decipher from the Ancient database.

104
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,688
真的么? 难以置信
Really? That is incredible.

105
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,270
我所设计的压缩算法非常有效
Well the algorithm I've devised
is extraordinarily efficient, yes.

106
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,527
哦, 求你了!
Oh please!

107
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:51,280
必须是这样
否则没办法在1.3秒内发完所有的数据
Well it must be,
in order to fit all that data into 1.3 seconds.

108
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,574
事实上, 只用去了0.3 秒
.3 seconds actually.

109
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,701
我们还有整整一秒钟来发送数据?
We have a whole extra second to fill?

110
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,371
整整一秒钟, 是这样
A whole extra one, yes.

111
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,586
足够用来发送个人消息么?
Is it enough to include personal messages?

112
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,676
当然, 可以包括几小时的视频
如果我们限制音频的话, 还可以更多
Sure, I mean several hours of video.
Much more if we restrict the audio.

113
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,096
我想我们在精神上非常需要这个
特别是现在
I think it'll do wonders for moral. Especially now.

114
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,807
我可以告诉我们的奶奶
我这些时候都做了些什么
I could tell my Grandma
what I've been up to all this time.

115
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,852
当然, 如果你的奶奶有足够的安全许可的话
是的, 你可以
Well if your grandmother had security clearance,
yes you could.

116
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,147
不过目前, 你可以告诉她
你很好, 而且你很想念她
But for now, you can tell her
that you're well and that you miss her.

117
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,818
这些都非常吸引人, 不过,
我还有工作要去做. 我是不是...
This is all very charming, but um,
I have work to do. Shouldn't I...

118
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,446
中尉, 也许你可以来处理一下
Lieutenant, maybe you'd like to handle this.

119
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,409
给每个人在镜头前几分钟的机会
让他们可以给所爱的人发一条个人消息
Give everybody a few minutes on camera send
a personal message to their loved ones.

120
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,827
我很乐意
I'd love to ma'am.

121
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,120
好了去做吧!
Off you go!

122
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,169
只要我和Zelenka 把四号飞船的引擎
成功接入到能源网
As soon as Zelenka and I can get
Jumper 4's engines tied into the grid,

123
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,254
我们就可以进行低能量演练了
we should be able to do a low power dry run.

124
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,088
很好
Good.

125
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,548
Rodney?
Rodney?

126
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,843
你不想给什么人发条消息么?
You don't want to send a message to anyone?

127
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:58,973
你知道么? 我想我会利用所有的空余时间,
为我自己录制一条消息
You know what? I think with all my spare time,
I'll just record a message to myself.

128
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,558
你认为呢?
You?

129
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,185
当然
Yes.

130
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,103
好的, 好的
Good, good.

131
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,031
这并不是一个拯救行动
This wasn't supposed to be a rescue mission.

132
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,491
Oren是我父亲的好朋友
Oren was a good friend of my father.

133
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,744
我想提醒你
I agreed to warn him.

134
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,038
如果有人跟你的家人很亲近
If someone close to your family,

135
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:26,459
一个亲近的朋友, 正处于将被幽灵带走的危险之中
你能够无动于衷么?
a dear friend, was in danger of being taken by
the Wraith, would you have not done the same?

136
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,669
如果这危及这次任务, 我会的
Not if it jeopardised the mission.

137
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,799
这么说与幽灵斗争, 我们就要舍弃
我们同它们的不同之处么?
So in fighting the Wraith, we are to give up
that which makes us different from them?

138
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:39,222
我同意停下来把他带上, 如果有时间的话
但如果没有时间, 我也无能为力
I agreed to stop and pick him up
if there was time, but only if there was time.

139
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,726
如我们可以, 我愿意拯救这个星系中的所有人
I'll be saving everyone
in the damn galaxy, if we could.

140
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,270
一个人连同他的孩子不是所有人
One man and his children are not every person.

141
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,731
我同意提供帮助, 如果有时间的话
I agreed to help, if there was time.

142
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,902
我们必须量力而行
You only fight the battles you can win.

143
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,862
我们转过去看看
Let's get this thing turn around.

144
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,246
它们正朝那个星球而去
They're heading for the planet.

145
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,588
OK, 开始录了, 电池很足
OK, recording, plenty of battery.

146
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,882
为什么我什么也没有看到
So why am I not seeing anything.

147
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:56,924
真蠢!
Stupid!

148
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:14,442
OK. 嗨, 爷爷, 奶奶!
OK. Hi Grandma, Grandpa!

149
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,196
是我Aiden, 当然
It's me Aiden, obviously.

150
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,742
来自一个离家很远, 很远的地方
Talking to you from a place, far, far, from home.

151
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,454
我很好, 你们不用担心
I'm good though. You don't have to worry.

152
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,416
这里的生活很平常
Life here is pretty routine.

153
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:46,224
我希望不久后就可以回家
不过你们知道, 如果
I'm hoping to get home sometime soon.
But you know, if

154
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:51,437
我不得不在这里多呆一会儿
我希望你们知道我很好
I'm stuck here a while,
I want you to know that I'm good.

155
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:56,359
我正在做一些我从来没有想到的事情
I'm doing things, seeing things
I never thought I'd see.

156
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:16,838
真希望能告诉你们一切
谁知道呢, 也许某一天, 我就可以跟你们说了
Wish I could tell you all about it.
Who knows, one day, maybe I'll be able to.

157
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,715
不过我希望你们知道
But I want you both to know,

158
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:26,806
你们就在这里, 永远, 任何时候
that you're right here, always, all the time.

159
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,231
抱歉Teyla. 即使以最快速度飞行
我们也只是刚刚比它们的舰队提前一点
Sorry Teyla. Even flying full out,
we're just ahead of the armada.

160
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,775
我不能冒险下去接Oren和他的家人
I can't risk putting down for Oren or his family.

161
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,193
知道了
I see.

162
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,781
我准备让我们脱离隐形状态, 以穿过星际之门
拨号吧
I'm gonna take us out of stealth mode for the pass.
Dial the gate.

163
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,121
等一下! 有虫洞连接进来!
Hang on! Incoming wormhole!

164
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,755
我听过一些故事
幽灵会拨号进来
I have heard stories of the Wraith dialling in,

165
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,884
以阻止受害人
通过星际之门逃跑
to prevent their victims from
using the Stargate as a means of escape.

166
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,719
这么说我们滞留在这里了
So we're stuck here.

167
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,806
只要让这艘飞船再次处于隐形状态
我们就会非常安全
Once the ship is rendered invisible again,
we will be perfectly safe.

168
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,934
我更担心的是, 不久以后
幽灵的舰队就会抵达亚特兰蒂斯
I'm more worried about getting the intel
about the Wraith fleet back to Atlantis.

169
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,937
我们至少可以整个晚上
不断的拨号
Then we'll keep dialling in through
the night at the very least.

170
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,609
不过如果我们等在
我告诉Oren 和他家人的那个地方...
But if we wait in the location
I told Oren and his family to meet us...

171
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,944
我正在赶往那里
That's where I'm headed.

172
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,164
我必须提醒你
我并不是很擅长做这种事情
I must warn you,
I'm not very good at this sort of thing.

173
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,666
不用担心
这个只有你和你的家人才会看到
Well don't worry. The only people
that's gonna see it, is you and your family.

174
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,127
是的, 还有你和美国军方
Aye, and you and the US military.

175
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,921
准备好了么?
Give it a shot?

176
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,631
我应该说什么?
What shall I say?

177
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,761
我想念你? 我希望你也在这里?
I miss you? I wish you were here?

178
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,471
我希望谁在这里?
I wish who was here?

179
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:49,931
我不知道. 你希望谁在这里?
I don't know. Who do you wish was here?

180
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,016
没有谁! 我只希望我不在这里!
Nobody! I wish I wasn't bloody here!

181
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,935
博士, 我还有很多人要去拍呢
Doc, I got a lotta people I gotta get through.

182
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:59,982
好吧, 嗯, 我想
我可以向我的母亲问好
Alright, uh, I suppose
I could say hello to my Mother.

183
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,319
很好, 就这样. 好了, 准备好了么?
Good. There you go. Alright, you ready?

184
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,362
是的
Yeah.

185
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,489
OK, 说吧
OK, go.

186
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,451
Hello, 妈妈!
我希望看到这个消息的时候你还好
Hello Mum! I hope this message finds you well.

187
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:14,413
我相信你的牵牛花现在正在盛开
I trust your petunia's are in full bloom by now.

188
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,917
噢, 我真希望
你还在用我给你的那些药膏
Oh, and I do hope you're keeping up
with the ointment I gave you.

189
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,629
如果你坚持治疗
那些真菌感染现在应该完全好了
If you've adhered to the regime,
the fungus should have cleared up by now.

190
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,966
- 有什么不对么?
- 什么, 真菌?
- What's wrong?
- Dude, fungus?

191
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,719
在她的脚指甲上  你刚才不是说过,
除了我的家人没人会看到的么?
On her toenails. I thought you said no-one
would watch this except my family?

192
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,513
是的, 不过真菌?
Yeah, but fungus?

193
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,223
那我到底应该说些什么?
What then shall I talk about?

194
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,016
我不知道, 她是你母亲
跟她说你爱她
I don't know, it's your Mother.
Tell her you love her.

195
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,977
不, 不, 我不能这样做
我在感情上承受不了
No, no, I can't do that. I'll get all emotional.

196
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,061
是么?
So?

197
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:41,774
我的妈妈, 她非常的敏感
就像你碰到的最美好的灵魂
She's very delicate, my mother.
As sweet a soul as you'll ever meet.

198
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:46,904
跟刚刚飘落的雪花一样纯洁 如果我很不安
那么她也会不安, 所以我不能这样做
As pure as the driven snow. If I get upset
then she'll get upset, and I can't have that.

199
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,739
我们并不是在现场直播, 博士
It's not like we're live Doc.

200
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,701
如果你不喜欢我们录在带子上的东西
我们可以再来一次
I mean, you don't like what we put on tape
the first time,we can always do it again.

201
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,036
- 可以么?
- 当然
- We can?
- Sure.

202
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:58,207
噢  那么我想我可以了
Oh. I suppose I could do that then.

203
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,378
好吧, 我们开始吧
Alright, here we go.

204
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,675
妈妈...
Mum...

205
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,848
我真是太想你了
I miss you terribly.

206
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,729
我做不到!
I can't do this!

207
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,244
来啊Oren, 快点出现!
Come on Oren, show up!

208
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,750
怎么了?
What?

209
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,794
就在不久前, 你还非常乐意他们丢下
Not long ago you would have blithely left them behind.

210
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,172
好吧, 现在情况不同了
Well the situation has changed.

211
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,970
今天早些时候, Ford中尉建议
我们去偷一群孩子
Earlier today Lt Ford suggested
we steal from a community of children.

212
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,723
那是因为他们有ZPM
我们可以把他们一齐带回来
That's because they have a ZPM
and we can bring them back.

213
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,309
到亚特兰蒂斯来等死?
Only to face death in Atlantis?

214
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,856
我和Ford都是军人
我们牺牲了无数条生命来学会如何生存
Look, Ford and I are military. We've spent
a lot of our lives learning how to survive.

215
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,108
我整个一生都在学习
如何在幽灵的威胁下生存
I've spent my life surviving the Wraith.

216
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,238
训练的一部分就是要明白
哪些人你可以救, 哪些你不能
Part of that training is knowing who
you can save and who you can't.

217
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,573
然后决定就是你们自己?
And that decision is yours alone?

218
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,118
我说过如果有时间, 我会等你的朋友
I said that I'd wait for your friend if there was time.

219
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:19,956
现在就有时间
你还想要我做什么?
Now there's time. What else do you want from me?

220
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,709
我实在是太害怕了
Too much I fear.

221
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,005
这将会是一个漫长的夜晚
It's gonna be a long night.

222
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:42,788
你并没有说那需要安全许可 是不是?
You didn't say anything that would
require security clearance did you?

223
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,374
安全许可?
Security clearance?

224
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,969
只能在这里坐视不管, 实在是受不了
This is hard, to sit and watch.

225
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:58,763
我们什么也做不了
There's nothing you can do.

226
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,765
我们可以做很多事
We can do a lot.

227
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,059
不过那将会是我们所做的最后一件事
It'll just be the last thing we ever do.

228
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,312
我们试了很多次了
星际之门仍然无法拨通
We are far outnumbered and
the Gate is still inaccessible.

229
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:14,070
不过如果我们救了Oren 和他的家人
我们也算是做了一些事情
But if we save Oren and his family,
we will have done something.

230
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,739
某些事
Something.

231
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,411
我会想你的kiddo
I'm gonna miss you kiddo.

232
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,665
我等不住想马上回到家里
带你去看篮球比赛
I can't wait to get back home and
take you to a basketball game.

233
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:31,420
看着科比和奥尼尔
为湖人再赢得一次冠军
Watch Kobe and Shaq take
another title home for the Lakers.

234
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,634
就这
That's it.

235
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,761
就这?
That's it?

236
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:40,638
我还可以对孩子说些什么
What else am I gonna say to the kid.

237
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:41,806
是你的小弟弟SGT?
It's your little brother SGT.

238
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:45,059
我可能再也见不着他了
为什么要让事情变得更糟呢
And I'm probably never gonna see him again,
why make it worse than it has to be.

239
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:49,105
- 那跟这个无关!
- 那就是这样做的目的
- That's not what this is about man!
- That's exactly what this is about.

240
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,025
别担心, 中尉
Don't sweat it Lt.

241
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,902
我很高兴我有机会说再见
I'm happy I got the chance to say goodbye.

242
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,904
是的, 不过你并没有说
Yeah, but you didn't say it.

243
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:00,241
要说的话太多
Not in so many words.

244
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,164
Ford中尉!
Lt Ford!

245
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,083
啊, 你准备好录制你的消息了?
Ah, you ready to record your message?

246
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,418
差不多已经完了
Already done.

247
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:13,129
实际上我利用特权私下为自己录好了
Actually I took the liberty of doing mine in private.

248
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,214
可能需要一些编辑
Now it may require some editing.

249
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:15,840
编辑
Editing.

250
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,676
是的, 我讲的可能有点多了
事实上我录了一整盘带子.
Yeah, I went on a bit.
Actually I used the entire tape.

251
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,760
你讲了一个小时?
You talked for an hour.

252
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,013
事实上, 我发现这很有治疗作用
See, I found it rather therapeutic actually.

253
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:26,350
我很自信, 我提出了一些很有价值的观点
事实上, 我非常确信
Now I'm fairly confident I've come up
with several valuable insights. In fact I'm sure of it,

254
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:29,312
不过最近几天我只睡了六个小时
but I've only slept six hours in the last few days.

255
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,813
这是给谁的?
Who's it for?

256
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:32,690
总体来说, 是给我妹妹的
Humanity in general, my sister. Look,

257
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,694
我不想你把它剪成几分钟
我的意思是, 这里面的东西跟金子一样重要
I don't expect you to cut it down to just a few minutes.
I mean, there is gold in here.

258
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:43,451
把我的放在最后面. 这样, 如果被剪掉,
没事, 只要星际之门的连接可以多维持几毫秒
我们就不会浪费那段时间
So just make sure mine's last and that way, if it gets
cut off, fine, but if the gate holds the connection a few extra
milliseconds then we won't have wasted the time.

259
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,660
我也很期盼这样
I look forward to it.

260
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,205
好吧, 好好欣赏吧
Well, enjoy.

261
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,832
金子
Gold.

262
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:02,929
预备, 5,4,3....
And in, 5,4,3....

263
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:09,977
正在同你说话的是Rodney McKay博士
现在是在失落的城市亚特兰蒂斯
我的操作实验室内
This is Doctor Rodney McKay speaking to you
from my base of operations in the lost city of Atlantis,

264
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,689
位于飞马星系的深处
located deep within the Pegasus Galaxy.

265
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:18,778
我在我们黑暗的时刻来临之前
录下来这些信息
I record this message on the eve of our darkest hour.

266
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:25,743
在我讲话的同时
一个外星舰队正朝我们开来
As I speak, an alien armada of biblical proportions
is on it's way, bent, dare I say hellbent,

267
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,205
准备将我们毁灭
in keeping with the metaphor, on our destruction.

268
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:34,335
我们将尽可能的延缓它们的进攻
不过我不得不说战败是不可避免的
We will do our best to stave off their attack,
but I'm afraid that defeat is all but inevitable.

269
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:37,922
我, 以及探险队中的其他人
I and the other members of my team,

270
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:41,384
面对的是无法想象的恐怖的死亡
face the most horrific deaths imaginable.

271
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:49,559
我们的生命将会以一种恐怖的方式
从胸部被吸食...
As our very lives are sucked
from our chests in a horrific....

272
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,020
OK, OK. 从头再来, 从头再来
OK, OK. Starting again. Starting again.

273
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:56,482
Ford, 把刚才那段剪掉了么?
Ford, just cut that alright?

274
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,242
那是什么?
What is that?

275
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,036
我从没有见过这种东西
I've never seen such a thing.

276
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,624
我要去仔细看看
I'm gonna check it out.

277
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,168
你会被发现的
You may be discovered.

278
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,003
- 我会想办法不被发现
- 少校
- I'll make a point not to.
- Major

279
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,506
我只是想看看那到底是什么
I just want to see whatever that is.

280
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:24,677
等在这里, 直到Oren和他的家人出现
Just stay here until Oren and his family show up.

281
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,321
倒计时 5, 4,3...
In 5, 4,3...

282
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:48,951
我的朋友们
我是亚特兰蒂斯探险队的Rodney McKay博士
My friends. I am Doctor Rodney McKay
of the Atlantis expedition,

283
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,913
鉴于我们同幽灵的英勇无畏的斗争
and as the facts of
our heroic struggle against the Wraith

284
00:22:51,913 --> 00:23:01,255
以及你们已经知道的我们的阵亡
在这里我想告诉你们一些最终的想法
and our untimely demise are already known to you,
in that light I'd like to pass along some final thoughts.

285
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:06,469
我在天体物理学领域所受到的良好教育
以及我所得到的第一手的经验
Now my extensive educational training and
first hand experience in the field of astrophysics,

286
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:14,519
让我产生了一个独到的想法
关于地球, 或者是其他类似行星
has given me a unique perspective that few on Earth or
on any other planet for that matter, can match.

287
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,524
现在我想花一些时间
把这个想法传递给你们
I'd like to take a few moments now
to pass along that perspective to you.

288
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:27,823
我将从对某个主题的一些观察开始
它对我来说, 既亲近又亲切
I'll begin with a few observations on a subject
that is both near and dear to my heart.

289
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,034
领导才能...
Leadership...

290
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,620
Markham先生 Markham太太
Mr and Mrs Markham,

291
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,956
我是Elizabeth Weir博士
my name is Dr Elizabeth Weir

292
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:38,334
你们的儿子是我的探险队中的一员
and your son was a member of my expedition team.

293
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:44,507
非常抱歉, 我不得不告诉你们
他在自己的岗位上不幸殉职
It is with a deep regret that I have to inform you
that he was killed in the line of duty,

294
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,676
就在几天以前
just a few days ago.

295
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,679
他在保卫其他人的时候阵亡
He died in the defence of others

296
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,764
他的牺牲拯救了我们很多人
and his sacrifice may have saved many.

297
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:57,144
她那敏锐的好奇心正是你们的女儿
在她作为探险队一名科学家的职位上
Her keen curiosity are just some of the qualities
that your daughter displayed during her duties

298
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:00,439
所展示出来的优秀品质之一
as a scientist on my team.

299
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:05,319
她以及她的一些同事
就在几个星期以前, 突然死亡
She and several of her colleagues,
died suddenly, just a few weeks ago.

300
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:09,156
我没有特权告诉你们她的死因
不过我可以告诉你们...
I am not at liberty to reveal
the cause of her death, but I can tell you...

301
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,158
在她在这里工作的那段时间
that during her time here,

302
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,204
Dumais博士是某件具有
深远意义事情的一部分
Dr Dumais was a part of something very profound.

303
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,915
她在这里的所见所感
是她从来都没有想到过的
She saw and lived things
she never would have dreamed of before.

304
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:21,669
你们应该为你们的儿子感到骄傲
他在保卫其他人的时候英勇的牺牲
You can be very proud of your son,
knowing that he died bravely while defending others.

305
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:24,839
我承认我并不是很了解他...
I confess that I didn't know him as I could have...

306
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:29,385
不过我知道他在队伍中很受人爱戴...
But I do know that he was well liked and
very well respected among his peers...

307
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:33,598
而且我还听到他经常提起他的家人
and I was told of how often he spoke of his family.

308
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,227
我真的希望能够告诉你们更多
I do wish I could tell you more.

309
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:44,317
我相信作为军属, 你们能够理解...
I'm sure you understand as a military family...

310
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,576
女士, 完了么?
Are you done ma'am?

311
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:59,290
请给我一些时间, 中尉
Just give me a moment please Lieutenant.

312
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,293
我一直忙于我的工作
I am keeping busy with my job.

313
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:07,715
我努力工作, 就跟其他人一样
以确保这次探险的成功
I work hard, like everyone else
to ensure the success of this expedition,

314
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,676
同时还要感谢我们科学团队的领队
and also to please the leader of our science team.

315
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,345
不, 不, 不, 不, 不
No, no, no, no, no.

316
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,763
首先是这个序列
This sequence first

317
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:14,555
然后是第二个代码
and then the secondary code.

318
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:17,266
除非你想把我们炸飞
就不用管这个顺序
Unless you're intentionally trying to blow us up.
In which case, excellent work.

319
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:19,810
他并不是总能记住我的名字,
He does not always remember my name,

320
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,772
但是与他一起工作, 我感觉非常非常愉快
but I have enjoyed working for him very much.

321
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:26,692
这是什么? 谁做的? 是你做的么?
What is this? Who made this? You made this?

322
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:29,445
他是一个非常受人尊敬的, 勇敢的人
He is a very honourable and brave man.

323
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:34,033
噢! 哎哟! OK, 抽筋, 抽筋, 抽筋!
哎哟! 哎哟! 哎哟!
Oh! Ow! OK, cramp, cramp, cramp! Ow! Ow! Ow!

324
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:37,912
直到现在, 只要他愿意,
我仍然愿意为他效劳
Until then, I will continue to serve at his pleasure.

325
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:41,791
在一个代数俱乐部中, 我吻了一个女孩
为这个我差点得了传染性单核细胞增多症
I almost caught mono, kissing a girl during algebra club.

326
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:44,252
为此我整整一个月没有去上学
那段日子我一直在想念着学校
I missed an entire month of school.

327
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:50,132
现在, 那个吻仍然记忆犹新
所以那还是值得的
Still, the kiss was something,
so it was probably worth it.

328
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,885
April Bingham
可爱的金发碧眼的女孩
April Bingham. Cute blonde.

329
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:58,182
上帝啊, 我喜欢金发碧眼的女孩
特别是... 留有短发的那种
God, I love blondes,
especially with the... the short hair.

330
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:05,064
Samantha Carter, 如果你在看的话
Samantha Carter, if you're watching,

331
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:10,903
心中的火炬还在燃烧
很不幸, 很快就要熄灭了
the torch is still burning.
Sadly, soon to be extinguished.

332
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:16,784
你知道, 你应该知道
我想你只是太...
You know, you should know. I think you are just so...

333
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:21,539
你很伟大 真的, 真的伟大
Well, you're great. Really, really great.

334
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,750
我要说你是与我共事过的最优秀的科学家
I would go so far to say you're the hottest scientist
I've ever worked with. In fact there's

335
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:28,087
事实上我无法在一晚上的时间内
找到我自己
probably not a night goes by I don't find myself, uh.

336
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,755
OK, Ford?
OK, Ford?

337
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:33,968
刚才的不要
让我们重新回到...
Let's lose that and let's get back to ...

338
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,221
...领导才能
... leadership.

339
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,409
谁将会看到这个?
Who will be watching this?

340
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:42,078
任何你发送给的人
Anyone you're sending it to.

341
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,205
家人, 朋友, 心爱的人
Family, friends, loved ones.

342
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,707
在亚特兰蒂斯会有人看到这个么?
Will anyone from Atlantis be viewing this?

343
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,918
没有, 这些消息是私人的
No. Messages are private.

344
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,337
你可以想多恶心就多恶心
You can get as mushy as you want.

345
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:58,970
这是一条给星际之门指挥官
Jack O'Neill将军的消息
Uh, this is a message for
General Jack O'Neill of Stargate Command.

346
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:05,643
我认为我有责任告诉您我所认为的
这个探险队的领导者在决策中所犯下的
严重的错误
I feel it is my duty to inform you of what
I consider to be serious errors in judgement
among the leaders of this expedition.

347
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:08,688
最值得一提的, Elizabeth Weir博士
Most notably, Dr Elizabeth Weir.

348
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:14,569
她鲁莽的行为将这次探险队的成员
一次又一次的暴露在极端危险之下
Her actions have repeatedly and recklessly exposed
the people of this expedition to extreme danger.

349
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,699
最终导致我们陷入如此悲惨的境地
Leading us directly to the grave situation
we currently find ourselves in.

350
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:21,033
好吧?
You know what?

351
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:24,787
不如我离开这里
让你独自录下自己的抱怨?
How about I leave the room and let
you record your whining in private.

352
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:26,873
很好!
Fine!

353
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:35,173
我一直在记录Weir博士值得争议的行为
现在我将为您详细阐述
I've been keeping a record of Dr Weir's questionable
activities, which I would like to detail for you now.

354
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,792
我从来不在意狗狗
I never cared for dogs.

355
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,170
太多的工作, 太多的需求, 太多的不可预知性
Too much work, too needy, too unpredictable.

356
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:17,089
我的意思是, 你打开一扇门
伴随着极小的声音, 它们就不见了
I mean, you leave one door open,
the tiniest little cracks, and they're gone.

357
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:22,053
你四处找它们, 到处贴传单, 但没有用
而且由于你的父亲拒绝购买许可证
You look for them, you put up fliers, it's no use.
And since your father refused to pay for a license,

358
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:25,389
动物收养所也没有办法跟踪它们
the animal shelter has no way of tracking them.

359
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:28,100
天知道在那个小家伙身上发生了什么
God knows what happened to that little guy.

360
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,770
现在来说说猫咪
这又是一个完全不同的故事
Now cats, now that's a whole different story.

361
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:34,857
猫们自给自足, 它们可以信耐
你摇动盒子它们就会跑过来
Cats are self sufficient, they're dependable,
you shake the box they come running.

362
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,235
有些人说这是由于食物, 不过我的猫...
Some people say it's the food, but my cat... See,

363
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,445
我真地相信他喜欢我的陪伴
I truly believe he enjoys my company.

364
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:45,243
在结束一天的工作, 回到家里的时候
看到一张熟悉的脸在那里等你
这是一件多么惬意的事情
There's something very comforting about coming
home from work at the end of the day and having
a familiar face waiting for you, you know?

365
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:51,207
我扯远了, 说到哪了
对了
Still, I digress. Where was I. Right,

366
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,543
领导才能!
leadership!

367
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,414
在这里!
Over here!

368
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:34,208
没事, 我是朋友!
It's alright, I'm a friend!

369
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,586
请快一点! 这边!
Please, hurry! This way!

370
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:39,463
赶快! 这边
Hurry! This way.

371
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,439
你们还剩下多少人?
How many of you remain?

372
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,691
我不知道, 到处都是幽灵
I don't know, the Wraith are everywhere.

373
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:01,986
来, 喝这个, 这是水
Here, drink this. It is water.

374
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:05,239
Oren, 你看到他了么?
Oren, have you seen him?

375
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:09,160
自从幽灵到来之后就没有看到
谢谢你
Not since before the Wraith arrived. Thank you.

376
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,747
我们必须走了, 幽灵会找到我们的
We must go now, the Wraith will find us.

377
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,123
不, 它们找不到的
No they will not.

378
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:17,335
我们的飞船有一个防护罩
它们是看不见我们的
Our ship has a shield which makes it invisible to them.

379
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,961
你们在这里很安全
You are safe here.

380
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:24,008
休息一下, 我们马上就可以离开了
Just rest, we will leave soon.

381
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:39,607
最后, 我要对探险队每个成员的家人说
Finally I would like say something
to the families of every member of this expedition.

382
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:43,731
我真希望我能够告诉你们更多
你们所爱的人正在做的事情
I wish I could tell you more
about what your loved ones are doing,

383
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:46,572
某一天, 我希望你们能够发现
and some day I hope you find out,

384
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:49,742
因为你们会感到惊奇
because you will be amazed.

385
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:56,415
我要告诉你们我为他们当中的
每一个都感到无比的自豪
But I will tell you that I could not be
more proud of each and every one of them.

386
00:31:56,916 --> 00:32:00,378
他们的英勇无畏让我震惊
Their heroism has amazed me.

387
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,405
他们的足智多谋让我感到惊奇
Their resourcefulness has staggered me.

388
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:36,706
Rodney 启动!
Rodney go!

389
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:37,957
正在启动!
Going!

390
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:42,962
现在!
Now!

391
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:53,472
我们面对的是非常可怕的敌人
以及一个无法预知的未来
We face a terrible enemy, and an uncertain future.

392
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:56,309
如果再没有我们的音信
But if we are never heard from again,

393
00:32:56,309 --> 00:33:01,939
请确信你们所爱的人并不是孤独的
know that your loved ones
did not face that uncertainty alone.

394
00:33:02,273 --> 00:33:05,151
我们会共同面对未来
We are facing our future together.

395
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:26,964
少校!
Major!

396
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,012
那里实在是太恶心了
It's pretty ugly out there.

397
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:35,556
这是Oren的家人?
Is this Oren's family?

398
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:37,099
不是
No.

399
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:41,687
在洗劫是之后
他们就再也没有看到过Oren
They have not seen Oren since the culling began.

400
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:45,024
这个村庄已经被洗劫一空了
The village is pretty much wiped out.

401
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:57,620
星际之门刚刚关上
The gate just shut off.

402
00:33:57,787 --> 00:34:02,166
在幽灵可能对星际之门做点什么之前
我们应该尽快拨号离开这里
We should be able to dial up and get out of here
before the Wraith can do anything about it.

403
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,877
求你了, 少校, 再给Oren 一些时间吧
Please Major, give Oren more time.

404
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:07,755
如果他能够过来, 他现在已经到了
If he was able to get here, he would be here by now.

405
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:09,549
我们马上准备回去
We've gotta get back.

406
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:11,884
那就走吧
Then go.

407
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,470
我会留在这里找他, 直到天亮
你可以晚点再来接我
I will stay and search until day light,
you can return for me later.

408
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:15,304
我不能这样做
I can't do that.

409
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:18,891
我把Oren当作自己的家人, 少校
我很遗憾你无法理解...
I consider Oren as family Major,
I am sorry if you cannot understand without...

410
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:21,143
我理解, Teyla
不过我并不是试图...
I understand it Teyla,
but that's not the point I am trying to...

411
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:24,981
不管你愿不愿意, 我会留下来
With or without you, I am staying.

412
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:29,652
你会送命的
You won't make it.

413
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:35,408
那么我请求你也留下, 就一会儿
Then I ask that you stay as well,
just a little longer.

414
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:40,329
允许某些好一点的事情发生
Allow something good to come of this.

415
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:47,044
好吧, 我们再给他一点时间
Alright, we'll give him a little more time.

416
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:54,969
我知道你很为我担心, 妈妈
I know you worry about me Mum,

417
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:58,306
不过每次挑战到来的时候
我们都可以找到解决的办法
but somehow we've found a way
to arise to each challenge,

418
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:00,433
所以不用担心我的安全
so I wouldn't fret about my safety.

419
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:05,938
这里的人们, 来自数十个国家,
大家都心系在一起
It's the people here, from dozens of countries,
all connected by a single bond.

420
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,274
我们代表着地球上的人民
We represent the people of Earth,

421
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:11,068
只要有事情发生
我发现我们地球人
and if there's one thing
I've discovered about we Earthlings,

422
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,446
就会紧紧的团结在一起
我不会奇怪如果我带回...
we're a scrappy bunch.
I wouldn't be surprised if I bring back...

423
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:14,906
先生, 你不能说"地球人"
Doc, you can't say Earthlings.

424
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:16,782
你的妈妈没有足够的安全许可
Your Mother doesn't have enough security clearance.

425
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:19,911
她知道我来自地球, 这不是什么该死的秘密
She knows I'm from Earth son, it's not a bloody secret.

426
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:20,620
哦, 对
Oh, right.

427
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:23,080
对不起妈妈... 不管怎样
Sorry mum... anyhow.

428
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:26,209
授权使用囚犯来测试一种实验药品
Authorized using a prisoner
to test an experimental drug,

429
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,794
这显然违反了日内瓦协约
in clear violation of the Geneva convention.

430
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:30,588
授权降下星际之门防护盾
Authorized lowering the Stargate shield

431
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:34,467
当准备进入的人的身份
受到明显质疑的时候
when the authenticity of
incoming travellers was clearly in question.

432
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:37,178
还有一处风景
我在临死前没有能够看到
That's another sight I'll die without having seen.

433
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:41,265
如果你像我一样旅行了这么远
你会发现想念尼亚加拉瀑布
也不是什么大不了的事情
See, to be fair - when you've travelled
as much as I've travelled, you'd think that
missing Niagra Falls would be no big deal.

434
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:43,059
不过你知道么? 这种思念不停的折磨你
But you know what? It gnaws at you.

435
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,103
还有很多电影我都想看
不过我现在看不成了
Alot of movies I wish I'd seen, that I won't see now.

436
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:48,981
从来没有看过Grease, 既便是
我在还是一个孩子的时候就已经有了
一个Olivia Newton John的纪念品
Never saw Grease even though I had a thing
for Olivia Newton John when I was a kid.

437
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:55,655
我一直都想看Ghandi,
我只看了《第六感》的前半部分
一直想知道它是怎样收尾的
I always wanted to see Ghandi, only saw the first half
of the Sixth Sense, always wondered how that ended.

438
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:58,157
我的妹妹...
My sister...

439
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:03,913
Ford, 如果你把其它部分剪掉了
一定要把这部分留下, 好么?
Ford if you cut everything else,
just keep this part okay?

440
00:36:04,455 --> 00:36:09,836
Jenny, 我是你的哥哥Rodney. 很显然
Jenny, it's your brother Rodney. Obviously.

441
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:14,006
我想说, 嗯...
I wanna say, umm...

442
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:17,093
我想说些什么
I wanna say something.

443
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:21,097
家人很重要
Family is important.

444
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:27,478
我意识到这一点是因为, 这里的人们
在某种程度上, 在心理上充当了家人的地位
I've come to realize that because the people here
have become a sort of surrogate family to me.

445
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,066
现在我知道你在想些什么
我从来不会去鼓吹那种情感, 不过...
Now I know what you're thinking, I've never been
the poster child for that kind of sentiment but...

446
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:39,782
当某个人即将面临死亡的时候
他看到的事物也更加透彻
when one's contemplating their own demise,
one sees things more clearly.

447
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:42,618
我真心地祝你好, 你知道
I really do wish you the best, you know.

448
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,954
我很抱歉我们无法更加亲近
And I'm sorry we weren't closer.

449
00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:46,831
也许, ...
Perhaps, ...

450
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:52,378
如果我有机会度过这次难关
也许某一天我们就可以
if by chance I make it out of this,
perhaps one day we can be.

451
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,922
我也很想这样
And I would like that.

452
00:36:55,339 --> 00:37:01,971
现在, 如果还有时间, 我想回到
领导能力这个主题上来
Now, if there's time, I'd like to go
back to the subject of leadership.

453
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:05,850
有人过来了
Someone's coming.

454
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:22,241
Oren!
Oren!

455
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:23,451
Oren!
Oren!

456
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:24,952
这个家庭到底有多大?
How big is his family?

457
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:26,704
他们在路上一定碰到了其他人
They must have met up with others along the way.

458
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:28,331
这会是一个问题
That's gonna be a problem.

459
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:30,166
我无法想象你们还在这里
I didn't think you'd still be here.

460
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,417
我们不会丢下你的
We would not have gone without you.

461
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:34,754
我们发现其他人正在路上
还有更多人在更后面
We found others on the way,
and even more further behind.

462
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:36,130
还有多少人?
How many more?

463
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:38,633
十二个, 可能更多
Twelve, perhaps more.

464
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,426
这里
In here,

465
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:44,305
这边! 快点!
this way! Quickly!

466
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:47,475
等, 等, 等, 等, 等一下!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

467
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:54,607
好了, 我们会尽可能多的多带些人!
Alright, we'll fit as many people as we can!

468
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:57,235
快点, 来吧!
Hurry, come on!

469
00:37:58,027 --> 00:38:00,655
一直向前! 一直向前!
Straight ahead! Straight ahead!

470
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:05,743
赶快!
Hurry!

471
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:11,040
没事的
It's alright.

472
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:12,375
没事的
It's alright.

473
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:24,197
我们的客人已经安置好了么?
Are our guests comfortably settled in?

474
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:25,364
是的
Yes.

475
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:26,782
很好
Good.

476
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:29,994
告诉我
So tell me,

477
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:32,330
到底有多糟糕?
how bad is it?

478
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:33,915
很糟糕
Bad.

479
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:40,129
每艘母船就像是一艘航空母舰
Each hive ship acts like a carrier group with

480
00:39:40,171 --> 00:39:43,758
大舰以及数以百计的小飞船守卫在周围
cruisers and hundreds of darts escorting it.

481
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:47,595
Groden现在正在下载探测器上的读数
Groden's downloading the sensor readings right now.

482
00:39:47,637 --> 00:39:50,556
我从没有看到过一次洗劫带走了这么多人
I've never witnessed a culling that took so many.

483
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,019
我们救出了一些人, 这还是值得肯定的
We saved a few, that's worth something.

484
00:39:55,645 --> 00:39:57,813
Rodney, 我们准备好发送消息了么?
Rodney, are we ready to send our message?

485
00:39:57,855 --> 00:39:58,981
随时都可以
When you are.

486
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:01,108
OK
OK.

487
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:12,245
Ford中尉刚刚完成为每个探险队成员
记录个人消息的工作
Lieutenant Ford is just finishing recording
personal messages from all the team members,

488
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:12,912
如果你愿意?
if you'd like?

489
00:40:12,954 --> 00:40:15,206
我很好
I'm good.

490
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:16,791
好吧
Okay.

491
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:18,751
在我个人的一点简短的说明之后
Well along with a short note of my own,

492
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:22,421
我还顺便为我们失去的人的家人
录上了一些话
I took the liberty of recording messages
for the families of the people we've lost.

493
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:23,214
这是个好主意
That's a good idea.

494
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:25,174
不过还有一个特别的人
But there's one in particular,

495
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:30,054
我想也许应该由你自己来完成
I thought maybe you'd might like to do for yourself.

496
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:37,687
OK, 只要你准备好了, 长官
随时可以开始
Okay, whenever you're ready Sir. Go ahead.

497
00:40:38,187 --> 00:40:42,859
我不知道Sumner上校的家人
是否还活着
I'm not sure if Colonel Sumner's
parents are still alive.

498
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,154
我甚至不知道他是否还留有一个家庭
我们大家都不知道
I'm not even sure he has
a family back there, not all of us do.

499
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:49,657
不过如果他确实有一个家庭
But if he does have a family,

500
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:52,493
他们应该知道他带着 ...
they should know that he died with ...

501
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:57,498
荣耀和勇气在完成他的任务的时候牺牲了
honour and courage in the perfomance of his duty.

502
00:40:57,582 --> 00:41:03,337
他担负着领导的重担
而且他做得很出色
He carried the burden of a leader,
and he carried it well.

503
00:41:03,421 --> 00:41:07,175
我没有机会更深入的了解他, 不过 ...
I didn't get the chance to know him well, but ...

504
00:41:07,175 --> 00:41:09,677
我所知道的是
I know this,

505
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:15,057
考虑到他作为男人的品格
以及我们即将面对的敌人
considering the type of man
he was and what we're up against,

506
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:19,604
我希望他仍然在这里
yeah I wish he was still here.

507
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:23,649
我无时无刻不在想你Simon
Not a day goes by that I don't think of you Simon.

508
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:26,277
实在是有太多的事情想跟你说
There's so much I want to tell you

509
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,738
以及跟你分享
and share with you.

510
00:41:28,905 --> 00:41:31,490
不过我不能
But I can't.

511
00:41:32,617 --> 00:41:35,244
我知道这不公平
I know this is unfair,

512
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:37,538
那么多东西你都不知道
so much you don't know,

513
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,417
但你却要在生活中支持我
and putting your life on hold for me.

514
00:41:43,044 --> 00:41:45,922
所以不要这样了
So don't,

515
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:49,675
我要你做的就是照顾好自己
all I ask is that you take care of yourself.

516
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:52,803
不管你在哪里
And know that wherever you are,

517
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:56,140
我的心会一直同你在一起
my heart is looking after you.

518
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:58,392
照顾好你自己
So take care of yourself,

519
00:41:58,434 --> 00:41:59,810
多睡眠
lots of sleep

520
00:41:59,852 --> 00:42:01,812
记住每天散步
and remember your daily walks,

521
00:42:01,812 --> 00:42:04,565
坚持按你的药方服药
and keep up with your prescription.

522
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:06,734
就是这些
Well that's about it,

523
00:42:06,776 --> 00:42:08,945
现在我要说再见了
I'll say goodbye now.

524
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:12,114
妈妈
And mum,

525
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:13,824
我真的很爱你
I do love you.

526
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:16,744
再见, 爷爷, 奶奶 - 我想你们!
Bye Grandma, Grandpa - I miss you!

527
00:42:17,036 --> 00:42:18,246
再见, 弟弟!
Goodbye bro!

528
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:22,708
再见
Goodbye.

529
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:25,378
再见, Simon
Goodbye Simon.

530
00:42:26,671 --> 00:42:27,755
再见
Goodbye.

531
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:40,393
我们收到了计划外的连接!
We have unscheduled offworld activation!

532
00:42:43,896 --> 00:42:45,648
接收传输
Receiving transmission.

533
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:51,571
来自哪里?
Who's it from?

534
00:42:53,698 --> 00:42:55,241
亚特兰蒂斯


Atlantis.
