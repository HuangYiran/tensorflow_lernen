144
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,370
老人家 你最好把枪放下
Old man, you better put that piece away,

145
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,730
小心打到你的脚
before you blow your toes off.

146
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,000
我只是想谈谈
We just talkin' here.

147
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,000
谈话结束了 快滚出去
Now we're finished talking. You get out the hell out of here!

148
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,640
好吧
Okay.

149
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,700
这是你的决定
That's your decision.

150
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,770
既然敬酒不吃
You don't want to take the silver?

151
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,790
那就吃罚酒吧
Better take the lead.

152
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,550
我想说的是
What I'm trying to say is...

153
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,170
把前男友关起来真让我丢脸
It's embarassing to have to lock up your ex-boyfriend.

154
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,000
那是谁的错  
Who's fault is that?

155
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,510
偷东西的人 你
The person who stole. You.

156
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,000
我是说 我们分手是谁的错
I mean, who's fault is it we're exes?

157
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,500
我们没有讨论这个问题 
We are not talking about that right now. 

158
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,500
我们在讨论
Oh yes, we are.

159
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,790
我是说 我们确实在说其他的事情
I mean, we're talking about something else,

160
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,000
但其实我们在谈这件事
but we're really talking about that.

161
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,010
你有阿司匹林吗
Do you have an aspirin?

162
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,700
这又不是医务室
This isn't the nurses office.

163
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,000
- 你到底怎么了 - 老天
- I mean, what is wrong with you? - Oh my God.

164
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,660
你什么都有 你又聪明
You had everything. You were smart,

165
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,360
又受欢迎 还是个出色的运动员
you were popular, you were a great athlete.

166
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,050
要不是大学时被踢出田径队
I mean hell, you had a full ride through college.

167
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,040
你还有全额奖学金
Had you not gotten yourself kicked off the track team.

168
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,320
你真的要这样吗
You really want to do this?

169
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,770
我他妈在伊拉克和阿富汗为国效力
Ok, I serve my fuckin' country in Iraq and Afghanistan.

170
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,720
我们没有在说战争 好吗
No, we're not talking about the war, OK.

171
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,630
我们谈论的是
We're talking about your

172
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,420
你酒后危险驾驶
being locked up for being drunk and disorderly.

173
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,050
我们都不在一起了 你还在乎什么
What do you care if we're not together?

174
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,790
莎拉
Hey, Sarah.

175
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,350
- 怎么了 弗兰克 - 你好 老兄
- What's up, Frank? - What's up, buddy?

176
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,940
真尴尬
It was awkward.

177
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,330
你们又开始约会了吗
Hey, you two dating again?

178
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,920
- 也许 - 没有
- Maybe. - No.

179
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,960
你非要把他关在这儿吗
Do we really have to keep him locked up in here?

180
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,990
是的
Yes!

181
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,540
为什么
Why?

182
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,310
因为我的长官说
Because the boss say I gotta'

183
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,000
要把你关到这个周末
keep you locked up for the weekend. That's why.

184
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,980
能告诉我怎么查车牌号吗
Could you show me how to run these plates?

185
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,000
蠢货 给我
Idiot! Give me that.

186
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,110
- 我只给你示范一次 听到了吗 - 好的
- I'm just doing this once, okay? - Oh, I know.

187
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,000
注意看
Pay attention.

188
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,570
雷 该死
Hey, Ray. Damn.

189
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,730
卡车的车牌号查到了
The plates on that truck checked out.

190

内华达州的 车主叫布雷利・ 托马斯

191
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,000

192
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,500
很好

- 做得好 - 谢谢
- Good work. - Thanks.

194
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,780
但是我想你大老远跑来
But I'm sure you didn't come

195
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,010
不只是为了告诉我这个吧
all the way over here to just tell me that.

196
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,870
我得去别的地方
I need to make a move.

197
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,860
去有任务的地方
Go some place where there's some action,

198
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,360
去我能有作为的地方
where I can make a difference.

199
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,970
就像你以前在洛杉矶缉毒组一样
Like when you worked Narcotics in LA,

200
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,570
我只是不明白
I just don't understand how

201
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,270
为什么你要放弃一切 来到这里
you ever gave it up to come to this place.

202
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,270
过去四天我做过最紧张的事情就是
The most exciting thing I've done in the past 4 days is...

203
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,000
从树上救下一只猫

204

萨默顿有它的魅力之处

205
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,310
也许吧
Maybe...

206
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,390
我从来没有离开过这里 我都要疯了
I've never been out of it, and I'm going stir crazy here.

207
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,150
你能帮我在洛杉矶找份工作吗
Do you think you could help me get a job in LA?

208
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,500
洛杉矶不是你想的那样
L.A. Is not all you think it is.

209
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,480
听着
Look...

210
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,070
我明白你的感受

211
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,030
你还年轻 你想要冒险
You're young. You want to experience adventure.

212
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,790
我像你这么大的时候
When I was your age,

213
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,590
也是一心想去洛杉矶
all I wanted to do was move to Los Angeles.

214
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,200
想大展身手 但是现在
I wanted to be part of the action. But now...

215
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,000
回首往昔 我的想法就不一样了
thinking back, I feel differently.

216
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,700
但是如果你真的想 我一定会帮你
But if that's what you really want, of course I'll help you.

00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,240
感谢你们这么早接到命令马上就赶来

219

这是一次绝密行动
This is a top secret operation.

220
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,790
45秒后 我们将

222
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,670
犯人名叫加布里埃尔・科特斯
That prisoner is Gabriel Cortez.

223
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,880
科特斯是自帕布罗・埃斯科瓦尔以后
Cortez is the most vicious cartel boss

224
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,020
最凶残的毒枭
since Pablo Escobar.

225
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,440
我们必须确保他不再重见天日
Let's make sure this guy never sees the light of day again.

226
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,110
所以要低调行事
We will travel underneath the radar.

227

他不明白你在说什么
He doesn't know what you're talking about.

285
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,060
你以为我是傻瓜吗 我看起像傻瓜吗
What, you think I'm an idiot? Do I look like an idiot to you?

286
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,910
你想要我问他吗
Do you want me me to ask him?

287
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,130
不用 你问他为什么要穿这个
No. I want you to ask him why he's wearing that.

288
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,380
为什么要穿成那样

289

你为什么要穿这个
Why are you dressed like that?

290

他问你为什么要穿成这样
He's wondering why are you dressed like this.

291
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,440

他说他是荷兰队的粉丝
He says he supports the National Dutch football team.

293
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,700
- 他妈的什么意思 - 足球队

他穿的球队衣服的颜色

297

荷兰人来自哪个国家
What country do Dutch people come from?

298

他是个混蛋 他差点弄断我的手
He's an asshole, he almost broke my hand.

He was reaching for something, I was worried for my life.

So I tried to hit you. I should have hit you the fuck harder.

302
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,860
一派胡言
That's such bullshit!

303
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,520
你终于说英语了
Oh, so now you speak English?

304
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,020
如果你懂西班牙语
If you knew any Spanish,

305
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,100
我刚刚就不会说了
you'd know I was barely speaking it a minute ago.

306
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,560
好吧 机灵鬼
All right, smart-ass.

307
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,440
凌晨四点你在干什么

308

这里是拉斯维加斯 老兄

309
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,260
长官 麻烦你来一下

我是欧文斯 找哪位

314
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,910
我正准备开门
Well, I just came in to open up

315
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,010
但是发现牛奶还没送来
the diner and the milk hasn't been delivered yet.

316
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,110
这也需要找警察吗
Is this really a police matter?

317
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,780
帕森斯先生一直都很准时的
Mr. Parsons always delivers fresh milk first thing.

318
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,800
他起得很早 你知道的
He's a very early riser, you know.

319
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,080
我不是担心牛奶
I don't even care about the milk,

320
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,670
这周镇上都没什么人 但是
nobody's even around this weekend, but...

321
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:16,000
我印象中他从来没有不送货的情况
that man hasn't missed a delivery ever since I can remember.

322
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,310
我有点担心
And I'm worried about him.

323
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,080
你有打过电话给他吗
Well, have you ever thought about calling him?

324
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,280
那个老顽固没有电话
Stubborn ole bastard doesn't have a phone out there.

325
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,250
对啊

326
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,280

I forgot.

327
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,660
我担心他会不会突发心脏病什么的
I'm just afraid he's got a heart attack or somethin'.

328
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,820
很抱歉吵醒你

329
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,720
只是没有其他人在
There's just nobody else around,

330
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,790
我也不知道该打给谁
and I didn't know who else to call.

331
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,190
你做得很对 克里斯蒂
No, you did the right thing, Christie.

332
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,570
我马上派个人
I'm going to send a deputy out

333
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,060
去他那儿看看怎么回事  好吗

334
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,970
- 谢谢 警长 - 没事 再见
- Thanks, Sheriff. - All right. Bye, bye.

然后分别上了两辆车

337
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,380
我们认为 科特斯应该是这辆车
And as of right now, we think, that Cortez is in this one.

338
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,600

419
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,820
我搞砸了 对不起
I really screwed this up, I'm so sorry.

420
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,860
我会救你出来的
I'm gonna get you out of this.

421
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,240
好吗 别担心
All right? Don't worry.

422
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,980
我一定救你出来
I'm gonna get you out of this.

423
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,690
如果你敢挡我路
If you try to stop me,

424
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,510
会死很多无辜的人
a lot of people that don't have to are going to die.

425
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,570
你自己看着办吧
It's your choice how to play this.

426
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,250
我现在只想好好开车兜个风
Right now I'm just a guy out for a nice drive.

427
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,160
看来没法把他轰上天了
So much for blowing him up.

428
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,590
你他妈闭嘴
Shut the fuck up!

429
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,630
请讲
Yeah?

430
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,170
雷 我们在帕森斯家
Ray, we're here at Parsons.

431
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:10,130
我们找到了尸体 他被谋杀了
We found his body. He's been murdered.

432
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,330
我们已找到嫌犯车辆
We got a positive ID.

433
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,250
是一辆在95号公路往南开的银灰金属色ZR1
A silver-grey metallic ZR1 headed southbound on US 95.

434
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,170
{\a3\fs21}确认人质在车内
{\fs14}Hostage is visible inside the vehicle.

435
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,940
- 他接近你了 警长  - 收到
- He's almost on you, chief. - Copy that.

436
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,000
别担心 我们准备好了
Don't worry. We're ready for this guy.

437
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,930
很多人都掉以轻心
A lot of people have said that.

438
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,880
科特斯总有法子击败他们
Cortez has a way of proving them wrong.

439
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,740
我要求你提高警惕
I need you to be alert.

440
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,570
你还得提醒你的人
And you need to remind your

441
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,000
车内有一名人质
men that there's a hostage in that vehicle.

442
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,390
接近亚利桑那州边界了
Coming up on the Arizona border.

443
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,990
- 他就快到你们那儿了  - 收到
- He'll be on top of you soon. - Copy that.

444
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,260
一切准备就绪
Everything's in place.

445
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,170
倒数五分钟 行动
Five minutes. Move.

446
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:10,230
坐好了 有场好戏给你看
Get comfy. I want you to have a good view of the show.

447
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,740
什么
What?

448
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,130
撤退
Fall back!

449
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,630
撤退
Fall back!

450
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,290
老天爷啊
Good God.

451
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,540
路障已被完全摧毁
The barricades been completely destroyed.

452
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,190
看起来这里像战场一样
It looks like a war zone down there.

453
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,650
多名警员伤亡
We've got several officers down.

454
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,460
我正在赶来
I'm on my way.

455
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,200
记住 不要碰犯罪现场的任何东西
Now remember, this is a crime scene. Don't touch anything.

456
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,000
明白
10-4 on that.

457
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,000
从破了的窗户来看
Ok, so the way I see it, we got a busted window.

458
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:32,230
这是场入室行窃被发现后的凶杀
All right, it looks like a burglary gone bad to me.

459
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,080
我觉得帕森斯走进屋子
I think what Parsons did,

460
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,540
也许是惊动了窃贼
he came in, and he surprized them maybe.

461
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,370
很可能是那样
It coulda been that.

462
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,150
你们检查轮胎印了吗
Did anyone check for tire tracks yet?

463
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,450
是他们先来的
They were here first.

464
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,870
我去查查
I'll go check.

465
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,360
- 别分散行动  - 遵命
- Stay together. - Yes, sir.

466
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,200
让我看看尸体
Show me the body.

467
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,850
就在那里
Right over here.

468
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,960
老天
Oh, Jesus.

469
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,400
入射点没有灼痕
No burn mark on the entry wound.

470
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,270
子弹洞穿头部
The bullet passed clean through.

471
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,000
一发手枪子弹弄不出这样的伤口
A pistol round didn't do this.

472
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,340
他们往哪条路去了
Can you tell which way they went?

473
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,140
往峡谷方向
Towards the canyon.

474
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,230
我们走
Let's go.

475
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,110
瑞士银行户头的三百万美金 我们说好的
Three million dollars in Swiss accounts per our agreement.

476
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,840
要知道 在我的国家
You know, in my country,

477
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,770
警察被收买以后都会说句 谢谢
the police say "Gracias" after being paid off.

478
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,240
你如果要继续像疯子一样开车
If you're going to continue driving like a maniac,

479
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,220
我能不演人质了吗
Can I stop playing hostage now?

480
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,030
不好意思
Sorry.

481
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,390
你要干什么
What is that?

482
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,290
找点刺激
Excitement.

483
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,380
什么
What?

484
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:43,330
该死 失去目标 我们失去了目标
Shit. Just lost visual. We just lost visual.

485
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,400
怎么会 找到它
How? How? Get it back.

486
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
我们四处找找
We're goin' around.

487
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,180
他跑了
He's gone.

488
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,960
什么叫跑了 给我接着找
What do you mean he's gone? Just keep looking.

489
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,240
你给我接着找 给我找到他
You gotta keep looking. Keep looking! Find him!

490
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,930
目标消失 我们会继续找
We lost him. We'll stay on it.

491
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,930
我靠
Fuck!

492
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:54,000
他在屋外被杀 事后尸体被搬进去
He was killed outside. His body was moved inside after the fact.

493
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,420
科特斯多久能到边境
How quickly can Cortez make the border?

494
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,170
照他现在的速度 65到75分钟
At the speed he's going, 65-75 minutes.

495
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,780
他正要去的那块边境
That little patch of border

496
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,270
肯定在峡谷深处
he's headed towards is mostly deep canyon.

497
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,950
能放大一点吗
Can you bring that up for me, please?

498
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,690
唯一的过境站在这里  阿尔戈多内斯
The only crossing point is here. Los Algodones.

499
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,510
我认识那的边防局长官
I know the CBP agent in charge down there.

500
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,770
他是个狠角色
He's a hard ass.

501
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:18,250
边境通道去年才重修过
And the border crossing was just rebuilt last year.

502
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:22,490
混凝土防爆墙加掩埋式伸缩型钢护栏
Concrete blast walls, in-ground retractable steel barriers.

503
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,500
简直是个堡垒
It's a fortress.

504
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,850
科特斯肯定不会毫无准备
Cortez isn't racing towards

505
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,680
就冲向目标
a target without a strategy to get through.

506
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,750
不管他有什么计划 我们都得做好应对
So whatever he's planning, we've got to be ready for.

507
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,460
向阿尔戈多内斯运输资源
Start moving assets to Algodones.

508
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,270
加强那个边境站的防守 没问题吧
Reinforce that crossing, all right?

509
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:36,330
这个小镇呢 萨默顿
What about this town? Sommerton Junction.

510
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,600
那里没有官方的边境站
There's no official crossing,

511
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,650
但那是离科特斯线路最近的地点
but it's the closest point in his path.

512
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,880
等一下
Hang on.

513
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:47,170
那里的峡谷太深了 不可能穿过去
The ravine is too deep to cross. It's a long shot.

514
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,270
但也别排除那个可能
Let's not ignore it though.

515
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:55,120
我给那里的警长打电话 告诉他躲远点
I'll give the Sheriff a call. Tell him to keep out of the way.

516
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,990
- 请讲  - 欧文斯警长吗
- Yep? - Sheriff Owens?

517
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,040
我是 你是哪位
That's me. Who am I talking to?

518
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,230
联邦调查局的约翰・班尼斯特  我们出了点状况
John Bannister with the FBI. We have a situation.

519
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,230
请讲
Well talk to me.

520
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:08,280
有个暴力逃犯正往墨西哥边境逃亡
I have a violent fugitive making a run for the Mexican border.

521
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,470
有很小的可能性
Now there's a small chance

522
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,290
他会试着穿过萨默顿
that he might try to cross at Sommerton.

523
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,120
虽然他不太可能去你那里
It's unlikely that he may be comin' your way,

524
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,000
但为了以防万一
but I'm going to send

525
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,880
我会从埃尔森特罗调一队特警过去
over a SWAT team from El Centro just in case.

526
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,100
无意冒犯 但我想让他们处理
No offense, but I want them handling this.

527
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,760
听着 我没空了 得挂了
Listen, I can't talk right now. I've got to go.

528
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,770
怎么了
What's up?

529
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,680
我不知道
I don't know.

530
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,790
联邦调查局的家伙说
The FBI says there's an

531
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,870
有个逃犯可能正往我们这里来
escaped fugitive that might be heading our way.

532
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:36,000
真该死  屋漏偏逢连夜雨
Shit, when it rains, it pours.

533
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,380
这不是巧合
This is no coincidence.

534
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,230
先是饭馆里那些家伙 现在又是这事
First the guys at the diner, now this.

535
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,580
这一切都有联系
It's all connected.

536
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,750
我得联系下贝利和托伦斯
I've got to reach Bailey and Torrance.

537
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,080
靠
Shit.

538
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,060
那边的灯是干什么的
What's that light over there?

539
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,740
你觉得那些是凶手吗
Do you think it's them?

540
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,940
你以为杀人犯傻到杀了人还在这附近逛吗
Do you think the killer's stupid enough to hang around here?

541
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,290
该死 给我手枪
Damn. Give me the Glock.

542
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:14,960
停车 停车
Stop the car. Stop the car.

543
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,210
那是什么玩意
What the hell is that?

544
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,010
贝利 托伦斯 你们在哪儿
Bailey, Torrance, where are you?

545
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,320
我们跟着轮胎印
We followed some tired tracks

546
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,500
到了镇子南边的峡谷边缘
to the canyon edge at the south side of town.

547
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,610
这里有些可疑人物
There's someone out here.

548
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,260
我们正要上前检查
We're checking it out on foot.

549
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,680
否决 你们必须马上撤回来
Negative. You need to fall back immediately.

550
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,210
你明白了吗
Do you copy?

551
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,270
给我对讲机
Give me this.

552
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:56,120
雷 这里有工地大灯 有个大工程在进行
Ray, we got work lights. Something big is going on here.

553
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,180
雷 听到了吗
Ray, do you copy?

554
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,400
雷 听到了吗
Ray, do you copy?

555
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:10,710
站住
Stop!

556
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,670
杰瑞 快跑
Jerry, Run!

557
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,130
- 掩护我  - 快去
- Cover! - Go!

558
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,780
那边出了什么事
What the hell is goin' on out there?

559
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,420
我们正在交火 很多枪手
We're taking fire, multiple shooters.

560
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:00,910
我就快到了
I'm almost there!

561
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,510
戴上夜视镜
NVGs on.

562
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,250
关灯 马上
Kill the lights, now!

563
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,140
什么
What?

564
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,020
你还好吧 杰瑞 能到我这里来吗
You OK, Jerry? Can you make it to me?

565
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:45,810
没问题
Yeah!

566
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,490
可以的
Yeah.

567
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:56,630
不
No

568
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,340
贝利在那边 他中弹了
Bailey's over there. He's been hit.

569
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:06,750
- 我掩护你  - 快走
- I'll cover you. - Go!

570
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:13,530
给我拿家伙来
Bring me the gun!

571
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:22,210
贝利 我们走
Bailey, come on.

572
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,190
该死
Shit!

573
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,060
走 走 走 走 走
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!

574
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,380
有人跟踪我们吗
Is anyone following us?

575
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,410
没人跟踪 没发现有车头灯
That's a negative. I didn't see any headlights.

576
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:06,430
很好
Good.

577
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:08,340
你们还好吗
Are you both OK?

578
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,370
天啊 杰瑞 你还在流血
Oh my God, Jerry. You're still bleeding.

579
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,780
我没事 我没事
It's nothing. It's nothing.

580
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,480
- 雷 - 找到伤口 压住它
- Ray - Find the wound and apply pressure.

581
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,480
好的
Okay.

582
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:20,280
对不起 没事的 没事
I'm sorry. It's Ok, it's OK.

583
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,220
我听说制服上的血迹永远也洗不掉
I hear uniform blood stains take forever to get out.

584
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,310
我才不在乎呢
Yeah, well what do I care?

585
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,750
反正你得负责帮我洗干净
You're the one thats going to be cleaning it for me anyway.

586
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,630
你一包扎好就得洗
As soon as we get you patched up.

587
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,810
你觉得弗兰克看到我们这样
Do you think Frank would be

588
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,220
会不会羡慕嫉妒恨呢
jealous if he saw us the two of us like this?

589
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,570
当然 你告诉他
I know, you can just tell your

590
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:39,210
他只是浪费时间罢了 是吧
buddy that he's just wasting his time, you know.

591
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:40,520
我不和犯人约会的
I don't date prisoners.

592
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,470
是吗 他那么爱你
Yeah, he likes you too.

593
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:44,850
没错
Okay.

594
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:48,000
挺住 杰瑞
Hang on, Jerry.

595
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,520
杰瑞 挺住啊
Jerry, hang on, Jerry.

596
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:52,620
雷 开快点
Ray, hurry.

597
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:56,150
别睡着 杰瑞
Stay with me, Jerry.

598
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,810
你不会有事的
Everything will be fine.

599
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,970
杰瑞
Jerry

600
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:38,370
走吧
Come on.

601
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:40,720
雷
Ray

602
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:46,530
杰瑞
Jerry

603
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:32,500
莎拉
Sarah?

604
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:35,660
莎拉
Sarah!

605
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,000
不敢相信他死了
I can't believe he's gone.

606
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:57,180
他死前还在和我说你的事
He's was talking about you, only minutes before he died.

607
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,000
他说了什么
What'd he say?

608
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,750
他让我对你温柔点
He told me to go easy on you.

609
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
还说你并不是无药可救
That you're not all that bad.

610
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,080
什么叫警察找你的麻烦
What do you mean cops gave you trouble?

611
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,630
- 什么样的麻烦  - 听着
- What kind of trouble? - Listen

612
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:34,890
你到底能不能准时搞定
Are you going to be ready on time?

613
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:35,650
当然
Yes,

614
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,350
准时搞定没问题
not gonna be a problem.

615
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,320
我希望你完成你的任务
I expect you to complete your mission.

616
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,900
我不想听到任何借口
I don't want to hear any excuses.

617
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,570
他妈的
Oh, shit!

618
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,000
- 我是班尼斯特  -  特警队还要多久到
- Bannister here. - How far is the SWAT team?

619
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:52,640
起码45分钟  怎么了
45 minutes or so. Why?

620
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,910
我需要你的帮助
Because I need your help.

621
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,590
你的逃犯正要从我镇上穿越国境
Your fugitive is trying to cross the border right around here.

622
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,480
你在胡说什么  萨默顿没有过境处
What are you talking about? There was no crossing at Sommerton.

623
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,650
他们会造一个
They're going to build one.

624
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:01,940
因为镇南边的峡谷非常狭窄
Because the ravine south of down here is very narrow.

625
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,350
这里有一大队人马
There's a whole team out here.

626
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:04,990
他们有军事经验和重型武器
Military background, heavy weapons.

627
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:07,470
他们正在峡谷间架设移动型突击桥
They're building a mobile assault bridge across that canyon.

628
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:10,220
- 是吗 你怎么知道的  - 我亲眼所见
- Oh really. You think so? - I know so, I've seen them.

629
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:13,000
我们和那些人交火了
We've been engaged in a fire-fight with those guys.

630
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,620
这个他妈的逃犯到底是谁
Now, who the hell is this fugitive anyway?

631
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:20,250
- 加布里埃尔・科特斯  - 你说什么
- Gabriel Cortez. - What?

632
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,880
你他妈的怎么不早点告诉我
Why the fuck didn't you tell me that earlier?

633
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,470
如果我早知道 我的手下也不会死
My deputy would still be alive if I would have known that!

634
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:28,370
我可没空跟你解释这些
You know what? I don't have time to explain every little detail to you.

635
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:30,610
你还是去门外巡逻一下就得了
Why don't you go out there and patrol, or something like that?

636
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:33,750
听着 我不认识你 我也不归你管
Look, I don't know you. And I don't answer to you.

637
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,000
这个混蛋
Son of a bitch.

638
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,050
再挂我电话试试
Hung up on me again.

639
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,350
你这个乡巴佬警长
Piss-ant country Sheriff.

640
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:48,570
菲尔 给我接特警队队长
Phil, give me the SWAT captain, all right.

641
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:49,570
好的
Got it.

642
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,230
再给我准备一份萨默顿的地图
And throw up a map of Sommerton up here for me.

643
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:52,210
我得好好查一查
I want to check something out.

644
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,640
- 长官  - 队长
- Sir? - Captain.

645
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,000
科特斯有可能会试着穿越萨默顿
There's a chance Cortez may actually try to cross in Sommerton.

646
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,540
你到以后 如果发现有桥 摧毁它
When you get there, if you find bridge, destroy it.

647
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,580
是 长官
Yes, sir.

648
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:18,080
移动型突击桥
Mobile assault bridge?

649
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,010
前面是特警队 你准备怎么办
That's SWAT up ahead. What are you gonna do?

650
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,900
死亡从不在你预期的时候到来
Death doesn't come when you expect it.

651
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,560
比如开赛车时
Driving a race car

652
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,340
或是在枪战中
or in a gunfight.

653
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:43,860
而当你晚上起来想喝杯牛奶的时候
Death is waiting in the kitchen

654
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,540
死亡竟会在厨房等着你
when you get up at night for a glass of milk.

655
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,790
我的侄女 我姐的大女儿 她是个好女孩
My niece, my sister's oldest, she was a good girl.

656
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:58,410
是我养大了她
I practically raised her.

657
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:03,370
那天晚上 她在厨房里用手枪指着我
Then one night, I find her pointing a Glock at me in the kitchen.

658
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,920
要不是她犹豫了一下
If she hadn't hesitated, it would have been

659
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,080
大理石地板上流淌的就不是她的脑浆 而是我的了
my brains splattered all over the marble floor, instead of hers.

660
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,140
妈的
Shit!

661
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,340
我操
Shit!

662
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:58,500
别想预见死亡的降临
Don't try to see death coming.

663
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,250
因为你预见不到
You won't.

664
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,550
特警队来不了了
SWAT's not coming.

665
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,570
我们得靠自己了吗
So we're on our own?

666
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,720
好吧  那谁来阻止这个科特斯呢
Well then, who's gonna stop this guy Cortez?

667
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,400
这是联邦政府的事
This is on the feds.

668
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,400
他们押解的他 他们弄丢的他
He was in their custody. They lost him.

669
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,830
他永远都不该是我们的麻烦
He should never have been our problem.

670
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,720
或许是吧
Maybe not.

671
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:39,660
但如果他穿过我们的地盘 他就是我们的麻烦
But if he comes through our town, he will be our problem.

672
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,700
好吧
Okay, so

673
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,880
我们可以睁一只眼闭一只眼
we can turn our back for a half hour.

674
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,170
我们当然可以
We could do that.

675
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:50,860
如果你那么做 最好把你的警徽也扔到垃圾桶里
If you do that, might as well throw these in the trash.

676
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,220
雷 任它去吧
Ray, let it go.

677
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:54,680
我不能
I can't.

678
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:06,300
杰瑞因为那混蛋而殉职了
Jerry's dead because of that guy.

679
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:14,230
雷 你了解我 我不是个懦夫 听着
Ray, you know me. I'm not a coward. Look

680
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:16,020
为了杰瑞
I would more than happily

681
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:19,000
我很乐意和你一起将他们绳之以法
draw down on those guys with you, for Jerry.

682
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:23,090
但是科特斯 他太狠了 他有一支军队
But Cortez, he's out of our league. He's got an army.

683
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:34,870
听着 如果你们想袖手旁观 我无所谓
Look. If you guys want to just step aside, that's fine with me.

684
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:37,100
我不会因此而责怪你们
I'm not going to fault you for doing so.

685
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,000
但我不会让那家伙轻而易举通过我们的小镇
But I'm not gonna let that guy come through our town without a fight.

686
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,830
我就职时也宣过誓 雷
I took the same oath as you, Ray.

687
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,500
雷
Ray!

688
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,130
看起来你缺几个人手
Looks like you're a little short handed.

689
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,010
你会需要我的
You need my help.

690
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:16,100
你的枪法还和以前一样准吗
Are you still as good a shot as you used to be?

691
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:20,740
肌肉的记忆能持续很久
Muscle memory lasts a long time.

692
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,690
弗兰克 你以前经常半途而废
Frank, I've seen you start a lot of things you didn't finish.

693
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:27,870
杰瑞是我的朋友
Jerry was my friend.

694
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:30,290
我帮朋友从不半途而废
I've never quit on my friends.

695
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:34,050
放他出来
Set him free.

696
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:38,680
你现在是副警长了
Consider yourself deputized.

697
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,950
我不会让你失望的
I won't let you down.

698
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,650
好吧 好吧
Ok, OK.

699
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:57,060
现在咱们有四个人了 满意了吗
That makes four of us. You happy?

700
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:15,920
菲尔
Phil.

701
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:20,280
我要你查查我们部门所有人的财务状况
I want you to pull financials on everybody in this division.

702
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,790
包括我 全部都查
Including me. No exceptions.

703
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:25,230
科特斯有内应
Cortez has somebody on the inside.

704
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:26,880
我想知道到底是谁
Somebody who tipped him off when

705
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,050
在我们行动前向他泄露了消息
we were about to move, and I want to know who it is.

706
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:30,550
没问题吧
All right?

707
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:09,390
雷 我
Ray, I

708
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,000
我得告诉你件事
I gotta tell you

709
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:16,190
当杰瑞和我在枪战时
When Jerry and I were being shot at

710
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,660
我吓得六神无主
I was scared shitless.

711
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:24,150
我的手控制不了地颤抖
I mean, I could barely keep my hands from shaking.

712
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,140
那很正常
That's quite normal.

713
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:30,250
所有人在枪战时都会害怕
I mean, everyone feels like that during a fire fight.

714
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,170
告诉你个秘密
I tell you a secret.

715
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,220
我现在可能比你还害怕
I'm probably more afraid than you are right now.

716
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,600
那怎么可能
How can that be?

717
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,110
因为我经历了太多鲜血与死亡
Because I've seen enough blood and death.

718
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:56,800
我知道将会发生什么
I know what's coming.

719
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:19,450
{\a3\fs21}你帮我联系华盛顿方面
{\fs12}I want you to ask Washington

720
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:20,850
提供我们萨默顿周边的
to get us real time satellite

721
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:21,880
卫星实时图像
imagery of the area surrounding Sommerton.

722
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,390
如果那个警长是对的
You know if this sheriff is right,

723
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:26,680
那我们就有一百多个联邦探员
and we've got a hundred federal agents

724
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,760
挤在阿尔戈多内斯的边境站
standing around Los Algodones crossing

725
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:30,030
百无聊赖 无所事事
with their dicks in their hands for no reason.

726
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:31,470
到那里最快的途径是什么
What's the fastest way to get there?

727
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:32,860
我们可以在麦卡伦机场申请一架飞机
We can charter a jet out of McCarren.

728
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:34,860
去办吧
Do it.

729
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,330
准备好了吗
Ready?

730
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:40,150
就凭我们这堆破铜烂铁
Yeah but how are we going to go up against

731
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:41,930
能对付那帮武装到牙齿的家伙吗
all that firepower with a bunch of shotguns and knives?

732
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:44,530
我有个主意
I got an idea.

733
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:55,300
要我入伙 你必须答应我两个条件
I got two conditions that need to be met before we do anything.

734
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,350
说吧
Well, name it.

735
00:59:57,650 --> 00:59:59,340
我也要像弗兰克一样戴警徽
I want to be deputized like Frank here...

736
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:03,660
这样 任何我造成的或遭受的损失
so any damage caused to or by me will be official business

737
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:06,010
都将由萨默顿警局买单
of the Sommerton Junctions Sheriff's office.

738
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:12,840
把手放上来
Put your hand on it.

739
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,130
我在此任命路易斯・丁肯
I do hereby instate one Lewis Dinkum

740
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:21,090
从今天开始担任警员
who'll serve as deputy from this day forward,

741
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:23,000
直到萨默顿的民众
or until his services are no longer required

742
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,540
不再需要他的服务为止
by the people of Sommerton Junction.

743
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:27,310
- 见证人 - 见证人在
- Witness? - Witness.

744
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:33,420
还有什么
What else?

745
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,980
第二个条件
Second condition.

746
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,290
我还是想用我的老乔琪塔
Oh, I want to hang on to ole Georgetta here.

747
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:41,520
看来只有我才能搞定她
Seeing as I'm the only one fit to handle her.

748
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,000
好 行动吧
Ok. Let's go.

749
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,780
我是说 你也能搞定她 雷
I mean, you can handle her too, Ray.

750
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,630
还有你 弗兰克 没准你也行
And you too, Frank. You might be able to handle her.

751
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:48,220
- 谢谢夸奖 路易斯 - 行了 干吧
- Well thanks, Lewis. - Ok, let's go.

752
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:53,810
瞧瞧
Voila!

753
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,400
天啊 路易斯
Jesus Christ, Lewis.

754
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:56,530
老天
Shit.

755
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,040
真给力
What a beauty.

756
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,790
- 你从哪里搞来的  - 薇姬
- Where the hell did you get this? - Vicky?

757
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:06,000
我的纳粹小杀手 1939年的维克斯机枪
She's my little Nazi killer. 1939 Vickers gun.

758
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:08,580
疯颠颠的小骚货
My little crazy bitch.

759
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:11,790
我没法在合法的前提下进行试验
Of course she can't really fire in the legal sense though.

760
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:14,060
但我已经尽可能修复了缺少的部件
But I did run down all the missing parts for her.

761
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,260
所以理论上可以正常使用
So she could function theoretically.

762
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,840
这事只能天知地知你知我知
Course that's between us and Jesus.

763
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,010
山姆大叔就没必要知道了
Uncle Sam don't need to know nothin' about that.

764
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,790
- 还有弹药吗  - 还有几链
- You have more ammo? - A few rounds.

765
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:24,340
有多少带多少
Well bring everything you got.

766
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,930
你以为我们是要去肉搏吗
What do you think, we are fighting in the crusade?

767
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:05,980
有备无患
You never know.

768
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,800
五分钟之后在主干道集合
We meet on main street in five.

769
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,690
我们需要大量车辆做路障
We need as many vehicles as possible, for the blockade.

770
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:29,900
老汉丽埃塔由我来开
I'll drive ole Henrietta here.

771
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:32,020
你给所有东西都取了这种蠢名字吗
You have stupid names for all your shit?

772
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,670
喜欢的才取名
Only the shit I love.

773
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:36,560
行动吧
Lets go.

774
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,060
到了之后我会向你通报
All right. I'll brief you when we touch down.

775
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,390
保持联系
Update me.

776
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:54,950
边防侦察队正在组织队伍
Border Patrol is putting a team together

777
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:56,420
但他们一小时之内到不了
but they won't be there for over an hour.

778
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:58,210
- 国民警卫队呢  - 更久
- National Guard? - Longer.

779
01:02:58,210 --> 01:02:59,640
军方呢
What about the military?

780
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,200
需要总统的命令
It takes a presidential order.

781
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,330
45分钟之内拿不到
We're not going to get that in the next 45 minutes.

782
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:21,530
科特斯必须穿过主干道
Now Cortez has to come thorugh Main Street

783
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:23,170
才能到峡谷那边
in order to get to the canyon.

784
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:25,290
除非他绕道阿萨莫拉
The only other option is Asamora.

785
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,710
托伦斯 你带着弗兰克和路易斯去那边封锁 
Torrance, you take Frank and Lewis and block that off.

786
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,610
阿费和我去通知居民
And Fig and I are going to warn the civilians.

787
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:31,520
明白
Got it.

788
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:36,970
- 雷  - 大伙听好了
- Hey, Ray. - Listen guys...

789
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:39,470
有个逃犯会途径本镇
There is an escaped fugitive coming through town.

790
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:42,070
你们待在这里很危险
It's too dangerous for you to stay here.

791
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:43,320
我希望大伙都回家
I want everyone to go home.

792
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,020
你们听到我的话了吗
Did you hear what I just said?

793
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,740
我们刚点了早餐
We just ordered breakfast.

794
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,490
为了你们的生命安全着想
It's for your own safety.

795
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:59,680
跟你说话的是个72岁的高胆固醇患者
You're talking to a 72 year old man with high cholesterol

796
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,360
刚点了培根芝士蛋饼 还要多加芝士
eating a bacon and cheddar omelet with extra cheddar.

797
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:04,430
我像是怕死的人吗
Do I look like I'm afraid of death?

798
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:09,270
别看我 我跟他点的东西一样
Don't look at me. I ordered the same thing.

799
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,830
我刚开始做饭
Well, I just started cooking.

800
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,330
- 克里斯蒂在哪儿  - 去买牛奶了
- Where's Christie? - Went to get milk.

801
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:24,890
务必远离窗口  好吗
Just stay away from the windows, ok?

802
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,190
远离窗口
Stay away from the windows.

803
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:28,910
- 好的  - 这没问题
- Okay. - We can do that.

804
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,930
好吧  你想怎么做
All right. How do you want to do this?

805
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:36,090
把车都停到那边去
All right, let's put your truck on the far side

806
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:37,470
然后再多找些车来
and then try to find some more cars to use.

807
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:40,730
我有个更好的主意
I've got a better idea.

808
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:42,150
- 我们需要几辆大家伙  - 对
- We might need somthin' bigger. - Yeah.

809
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:45,700
这边要三辆 一定要堵死
Maybe three on this side. Have to be enough to fill it in.

810
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,910
你打算干什么
What are you planning to do?

811
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:54,400
- 退后  - 不行 丁肯 电线怎么办
- Just stay back. - No Dinkum, what about the lines?

812
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,820
只是电话线和电视电缆 供电网在那边
This is the phone and cable. Electricity's over there.

813
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:00,830
我不是这个意思 如果你切断电话线...
No, that's not what I mean. If you cut the phone line...

814
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:11,510
快下来
Geronimo!

815
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:14,880
- 快下来  - 后退 后退
- Geronimo! - Get back. Get back!

816
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:21,000
干得漂亮
Fucking perfect.

817
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:23,960
我们去找车吧
Let's get some cars in place.

818
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,530
真该死
Well, shit!

819
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:30,250
天啊
Jesus.

820
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:33,110
约翰
John?

821
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,850
- 你最好来看一下  - 什么
- You'd better take a look at this. - What is it?

822
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,290
国土安全部的实时卫星信号
The Satellite feed from Homeland Security,

823
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:37,610
这是紧邻萨默顿
this is the live view of the canyon

824
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:39,450
南部峡谷的卫星即时画面
just south of Sommerton Junction.

825
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:40,530
看那里
Look at that.

826
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:42,790
- 有座桥  - 对
- That's a bridge? - Yeah.

827
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:44,790
难以置信
I don't believe it.

828
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,980
那个警长是对的 他什么来路
The Sheriff was right. Who is this guy?

829
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,540
1998年 欧文斯加入洛杉矶警局
In 1988, Owens joined the LAPD.

830
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:55,740
在精英战术部门接受培训
He trained under their Elite Tactical Division.

831
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,010
在缉毒组干了五年 然后离职了
Worked Narcotics for five years, then he quit.

832
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,040
为什么
Why?

833
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,760
他为了追踪半吨可卡因的下落而搞砸了一个派对
Well, he crashed a party on some bad guys movin' a half ton of coke.

834
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,370
他为此得到了英勇勋章
He took home the Medal of Valor.

835
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:06,080
代价是挨了五枪
Five bullet holes for his trouble.

836
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,340
欧文斯活下来了 另外七人没有
Owens lived, but seven other cops didn't.

837
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:10,380
这就是欧文斯的背景
So that was it for Owens.

838
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,010
他大概是看够了流血牺牲 就离开了
Guess he's seen enough bloodshed, so walked away.

839
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,920
去萨默顿当了小镇警长
He went to Sommerton to play Sheriff.

840
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,640
谢谢

842
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:26,690
老天 你在干嘛 丁肯
Oh my God! What are you doing Dinkum?

843
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:30,470
- 你疯了吗  蠢货  - 冷静点
- Have you lost your mind, you idiot! - Settle down.

844
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:32,050
就快搞定了
I almost got it.

845
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:34,690
-丁肯 - 别闹了
- Dinkum! - Don't do that!

846
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:41,000
丁肯 丁肯 你没事吧
Dinkum! Dinkum, are you okay?

847
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,120
我的老天 你没事吧
Oh my God, are you all right?

848
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:47,320
汉丽埃塔呢
Henrietta?

849
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:50,720
成功了
It worked!

850
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:55,650
干得好 副警长 干得好
Nice job, deputy. Nice job.

851
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:09,000
雷 我们需要比这个更大的家伙

852
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:12,190
我有个主意
I got an idea.

853
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:14,510
- 托伦斯  - 已封锁阿萨莫拉
- Torrance. - Asamora's blocked off.

854
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:17,320
很好 让丁肯和马汀兹到学校来找我
Good. Have Dinkum and Martinez meet me in the school yard.

855
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,910
我需要你去老旅馆楼顶
And I need you to be on top of the roof of the old hotel

856
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,400
帮我侦察
to be my spotter.

857
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,880
费济 你去南边
Figgy, you go to the Southside,

858
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,030
看看建筑物是否疏散完毕  好吗
and check if the buildings are cleared, okay?

859
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:27,330
- 我马上回来  - 我去了
- I'll be right back. - On my way.

860
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,020
来玩场射击游戏吧
Time for a turkey shoot.

861
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:06,840
该死
Oh, shit!

862
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:28,140
主干道上有人从南边过来
I got guys on Main Street approaching from the South.

863
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,490
不要开枪 等我们到了再说
Do not engage, wait for us to get there.

864
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:31,550
收到 雷

865
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:52,640

你们两个去右边
You two take the right.

869
01:09:05,070 --> 01:09:07,230
看见会动的东西就打
Shoot anything that moves.

870
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,830
不会动的也照打不误
If it doesn't move, shoot it anyway.

871
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,590
等我们办完正事
Once our work is done here,

872
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:19,240
就把这地方夷为平地

What the hell's goin' on? What are these cars parked for?

你为什么藏在车后面

为了这妞屁股杀人也值了
I could kill for that ass.

880
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:55,480

- 快来帮帮他  - 看到了 等一下
- Somebody help him! - I see it. Hold on.

915
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:55,900
别担心 只是玻璃碴

916
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:00,660

我到底有多优秀
How good I really am.

01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,550
但考虑到你的形象
But since you're still going

972
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:25,440
应该是一名死里逃生的人质
to need to look the part of an escaped hostage.

973
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:29,120
这是给你的离别礼物
Consider this a goodbye gift.

974
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:34,430
什么意思
What do you mean?

975
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,460
搞什么鬼
What the fuck?!

976
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:06,900
该死
Shit!

977
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,960
你想跟我玩吗
So you want to play?

978
01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:13,080
那就来玩
Let's play!

979
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:37,270
然后呢
Now what?

980
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,640
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

981
01:26:53,010 --> 01:26:54,100
该死
Fuck!

982
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,500
我要杀了你
I'm gonna kill you!

983
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:09,380
该死
Shit!

984
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:25,300
你毁了我的车
You fucked up my car.

985
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:28,620
你毁了我的假期
You fucked up my day off.

986
01:29:32,050 --> 01:29:33,370
知道吗 警长
You know what, Sheriff?

987
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:37,410
你只需要让我跨过这条边境线
All you have to do is let me walk across that border.

988
01:29:39,470 --> 01:29:42,960
每天都有成千上万的墨西哥人穿过这里
Hell, twelve thousand Mexicans come across every day.

989
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,000
有一个回去也无伤大雅
You shouldn't mind if one goes back.

990
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:48,580
你觉得如何
What do you say?

991
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,690
你毁了我们移民的形象
You make us immigrants look bad.

992
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:56,910
那好吧
Well then,

993
01:29:57,910 --> 01:30:00,120
我们来讨论一下驱逐我的条件
let's discuss my deportation, shall we?

994
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:05,610
卡洛斯 等一下
Carlos, uno momento.

995
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,960
我的私人财务顾问
This is my personal banker.

996
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,700
只需要告诉他你的银行账号
Simply tell him your account number.

997
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:13,090
你的就增加五百万美金的财富
You will be five million dollars richer.

998
01:30:13,390 --> 01:30:14,880
我们好聚好散
We will part as friends.

999
01:30:25,570 --> 01:30:26,670
一千万
Ten million.

1000
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:35,580
戴上
Put those on.

1001
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:37,450
不然我帮你戴
Or I will.

1002
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:45,890
这故事太老套了
Maybe once upon a time.

1003
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:52,340
你的时代结束了 老东西
Your time is over, abuelito.

1004
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:55,100
我的时代才刚开始
My time is just starting.

1005
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:08,250
游戏开始
Game on.

1006
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:10,010
你应该一开始就拿钱 老头
You should have taken the money, old man!

1007
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:34,680
好 好
Ok! Ok!

1008
01:33:36,970 --> 01:33:38,080
两千万
Twenty million.

1009
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:41,530
睁只眼闭只眼 两千万就到手了
Twenty million dollars just to look the other way.

1010
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,260
我的尊严不是用来卖的
My honor is not for sale.

1011
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:47,230
去你妈的尊严
Fuck your honor!

1012
01:34:20,150 --> 01:34:22,110
你被捕了
You are under arrest.

1013
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:48,910
骑兵队到了
Here comes the cavalry.

1014
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:53,230
约翰・班尼斯特 联邦调查局  
John Bannister, FBI.

1015
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:54,630
很高兴你们能赶来
Glad you could make it.

1016
01:34:57,970 --> 01:34:59,710
情况如何 科特斯在哪儿
So what happened here? Where Cortez?

1017
01:34:59,710 --> 01:35:01,000
警长去追他了
The Sheriff went after him.

1018
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:04,040
比起科特斯 我更想知道警长情况如何
I'm more concerned about him right now than I am about Cortez.

1019
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:08,000
你们两个运气不错 
Looks like you're both in luck.

1020
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:28,650
瞧啊
Look at that.

1021
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:32,580
太好了 他干得漂亮
Good thing. Good for him.

1022
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:41,360
最后一次 只不过这次轮到你吃惊了
One last time. Only this time, the surprise is on you.

1023
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,680
我们走
Let's go guys.

1024
01:35:49,470 --> 01:35:50,510
约翰
John!

1025
01:35:52,530 --> 01:35:53,580
理查兹
Richards!

1026
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:55,610
你还好吗
Are you Ok?

1027
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:57,770
我还好
Yeah, I'm Ok.

1028
01:35:58,370 --> 01:36:00,140
非常抱歉 约翰
I'm so sorry, John.

1029
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:03,340
他要杀了我 见到你太好了
He was going to kill me. It's so good to see you.

1030
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:07,760
幸好他没杀你 我很高兴他没杀你
Yeah, I'll glad he didn't. I'm really glad he didn't.

1031
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:11,300
不然的话我就无法享受
Because that would have cost me the satisfaction

1032
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:14,390
亲手逮捕你的满足感了
of being able to arrest you myself.

1033
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:19,920
你们不是早就习惯共同驾驶吗
I know the two of you are used to being driving buddies.

1034
01:36:21,570 --> 01:36:23,880
再告诉你一件事 瑞士银行账户
And for your information, Swiss bank accounts

1035
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,000
可不像原来那样机密了
are not as secret as they use to be.

1036
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,060
我们走
Let's go.

1037
01:36:34,930 --> 01:36:35,980
妈的
Shit!

1038
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:39,080
所以我才开了枪
That's why I shot him.

1039
01:36:41,290 --> 01:36:42,620
我能走路
I can walk!

1040
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:45,080
一个人在战场上英勇负伤
Just because a man gets wounded in the line on duty

1041
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,740
不代表他就不能走路了  不用你们扶
don't mean he can't walk. I don't want that.

1042
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:49,230
做得好 雷 马汀兹 托伦斯
Way to go, Ray, Martinez, Torrance.

1043
01:36:49,230 --> 01:36:50,260
我能走路
I can walk.

1044
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:54,110
如果克里斯蒂实在想扶我的话 也可以
Maybe if Christie wants to help me, she could.

1045
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,120
谢谢 小姑娘
Thanks little one.

1046
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:58,320
随时吩咐 路易斯
Anytime, Lewis.

1047
01:37:01,170 --> 01:37:02,170
费济
Figgy!

1048
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:04,960
费济
Figgy!

1049
01:37:05,410 --> 01:37:07,150
抱歉 抱歉
Sorry! Sorry!

1050
01:37:08,150 --> 01:37:09,330
让我看看 让我看看
Let me see, let me see.

1051
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:13,990
- 是50毫米口径的子弹  - 痛到死的50毫米
- That's a .50 caliber. - That's a painful .50.

1052
01:37:14,690 --> 01:37:16,260

Look at that.

1053
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:17,660
你怎么样
What about you?

1054
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:19,050
我很好
I'm fine.

1055
01:37:20,050 --> 01:37:22,510
拜托 别闹了 这是气枪弹打的
Oh, please, come on. That's a BB gun.

1056
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:24,920
我们完成报告后马上离开
Let's finish the report and get out of here.

1057
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,560
好的
Good.

1058
01:37:28,910 --> 01:37:33,330
我低估你们了 警长
I'll say it. I completely underestimated you, Sheriff.

1059
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:37,430
没事
It's Ok.

1060
01:37:47,410 --> 01:37:51,090
你是个了不起的执法者 从不轻易放弃
You're a hell of a lawman. And you don't give up too easy.

1061
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:54,000
你说得对
You're right.

1062
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:55,850
这是我的家园
This is my home.

1063
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:58,560
了不起
Impressive.

1064
01:38:01,150 --> 01:38:02,410
了不起
Impressive.

1065
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:08,650
警长
Sheriff.

1066
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:17,270
留着吧
Keep it.

1067
01:38:21,050 --> 01:38:22,130
你应得的
You earned it.

1068
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:28,090
- 谢谢 雷 - 这也是杰瑞所希望的
- Thanks, Ray. - Jerry would want you to have it.

1069
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:30,180
谢谢

1070
01:38:38,130 --> 01:38:39,180

01:38:39,230 --> 01:38:40,280
雷
Ray!

1072
01:38:41,070 --> 01:38:44,400
我的车他妈的是怎么回事
What in God's name happened to my car?

1073
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:48,090
下次别再把车停在消防区了
Next time don't park it in the fire zone.

1074
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,800
白痴
Schmuck.
