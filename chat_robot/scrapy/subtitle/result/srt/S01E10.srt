1
00:00:01,083 --> 00:00:02,793
他们说自己是Genii人.
They call themselves the Genii.

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:06,130
他们很单纯,但也是出色的农夫和商人.
They are a simple people,
but good farmers and fair traders.

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,548
他们看上去十分友好.
They look friendly enough.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,219
年纪最长的是 Tyrus.
我和他也打过好几次交道.
The eldest one is called Tyrus.
I've traded with him on many occasions.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,430
我正带他们进来.
所有设备进入静止状态.
I'm bringing them in.
All operations to silent mode.

6
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,308
你知道的,如果人们只会
You know, if people could just learn to keep their

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,101
躲在地下的秘密基地里面...
secret underground hatches locked...

8
00:00:19,143 --> 00:00:22,271
所以这所有的农业有关的东西只是掩饰.
So the whole farmer thing is just a front.

9
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,315
下一次的大淘汰可能是在几十年之后.
The next culling was supposed to be decades away.

10
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,192
我们希望大家联合起来对付幽灵.
We're looking for allies against the Wraith.

11
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:30,530
我们希望未来五年内可以测试成功我们的原子武器.
We had hoped to test our first
atomic weapon five years from now.

12
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:32,698
我们有这么多时间么, Sheppard?
Do we have that much time, Sheppard?

13
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:33,699
没有.
No.

14
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:36,244
和幽灵飞船的电脑系统的连接对你有没有帮助?
How does getting access
to a Wraith ship's computer help you?

15
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:39,789
根据这个界面装置,我们可以找到所有幽灵飞船的位置.
With this interface device, we can learn
the locations of all the Wraith ships.

16
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,958
所以你现在知道往哪运炸弹了.
So you know where to deliver your new bombs.

17
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:44,168
幽灵一定不知道我们来过这里.
The Wraith must not know we were ever here.

18
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,379
-帮帮我.
- 别管他了.
- Help me.
- I said leave him.

19
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,214
-求你!
- 安静!
- please!
- Be silent!

20
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:53,511
我爸爸呐?
Where is my father?

21
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,804
他没有逃出来.
He did not survive.

22
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:57,849
把他留在那里等于你亲手杀了他.
By leaving him to die, you may just
as well have killed him yourself.

23
00:00:58,432 --> 00:01:01,435
你不想和 Genii的任何一个人成为敌人.
You do not want to make an enemy of the Genii.

24
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,908
我很久没回去了.
I haven't been to the mainland in a while.

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,660
大家都怎么样了?
How's everybody settling in?

26
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,037
Halling觉得第一批作物的收成会不错.
Halling believes the first crops will have a good yield.

27
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:22,707
大家还是很想家?
Everybody still miss home?

28
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:27,753
大家仍然在谈论回去的事情,尽管我跟他们说幽灵
There is still talk of returning,
even though I've told them the Wraith have

29
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,881
为了报复我们的反抗,把Athos烧死了.
scorched Athos bare in revenge for our resistance.

30
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:33,593
嗯,这里会开始像家的.
Well, maybe in time, this place will start
to begin to feel like home.

31
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:36,387
你看见了么?
Do you see that?

32
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:40,433
这不会是风暴.
It can't be a storm.

33
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,394
它正席卷而来.
It stretches across the whole horizon.

34
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,022
我从没见过这么高的东西.
I've never something like that from so high.

35
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,941
在这个高度我见过很多东西,除此之外.
I've seen a lot of things from this altitude,
but nothing like that.

36
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,946
Atlantis基地, 我是探险者一号.
Atlantis base, this is Jumper one.

37
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:56,365
我们准备调转方向,研究一个风暴.
We're going to change our heading
to investigate a storm.

38
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,867
少校, 我是Weir.
Major, this is Weir.

39
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,494
我们没有信号了,你断线了.
We didn't copy that.
You're breaking up.

40
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,079
我说这里有...
I said there's a...

41
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,873
它正向着...
And it's headed right...

42
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,709
小型天气预报.
Little weather forecasting.

43
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:12,381
他说"天气预报"?
Did he just say "weather forecasting?"

44
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,770
是不是从上面看所有的风暴都这样?
Do all storms look like this from above?

45
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:27,104
不.
No.

46
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,024
这至少覆盖了星球20% 的地区.
This must cover 20% of the planet.

47
00:02:30,274 --> 00:02:32,360
它是不是正向着大陆?
Is it headed towards the mainland?

48
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,947
它的轨迹显示它正向着基地.
It's tracking right toward the settlement.

49
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:39,075
然后呐?
And after that?

50
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,247
正对Atlantis.
Straight to Atlantis.

51
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:46,854
星际之门之亚特兰蒂斯
第一季第10集 飓风
Season 1 : Episode 10
The Storm

52
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:57,069
这个星球基本上和地球大小一样.
This planet is basically the same size as Earth.

53
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:00,656
但是,地球上的飓风从来没有如此强烈
Now, hurricanes on earth never
get as big as this bad boy

54
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,451
因为他们一到达海滨,就会小很多...
because once they hit the shore,
the brakes get put on...

55
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:06,871
但是这里没有这么大块的陆地让它减速, 所以
But without as much land mass
to slow it down here, it's just

56
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,456
它只会越来越迅猛.
gaining momentum.

57
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:10,583
他们两个都是,是的.
Both of them are, yes.

58
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,751
两个?
Both of them?

59
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,461
我们只看到了一个.
We saw only one.

60
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,962
看起来就像是一个.
It only looked like one.

61
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,547
根据远古时代的记载,
Now, according to the ancient database,

62
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,926
每20到30年,
海洋会变得非季节性的温暖.
every 20 or 30 years,
the sea gets unseasonably warm.

63
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:22,512
而现在,但气温过于稳定时,
Now, that, for reasons too boring to get into,

64
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,805
飓风发生的几率就很大.
means that hurricanes are much more likely to occur.

65
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,849
就像El Nino,海洋...
Like El Nino, the ocean is...

66
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,018
就像我说的,没有温差变化.
Like I said, too boring to go into.

67
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,061
重点.
Focus.

68
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:31,646
看,基本上就像这样一个状况
Look, basically if you have a situation

69
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:33,940
这里将要很多飓风发生,
where there are a bunch of hurricanes out there,

70
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:36,025
两个飓风相遇的几率就变大了.
the likelihood of two colliding is greatly increased.

71
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,109
这就是现在的情况.
That's what's happening.

72
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,611
与其说是相撞,不如说是合并.
It's more like a merger than a collision.

73
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,988
它们将彼此的力量综合.
They are intersecting and combining their power.

74
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,365
然后呐?
And?

75
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,617
向着我们笔直而来.
It's headed right towards us.

76
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,663
你刚才说古代,这样的飓风每20年到30年发生一次.
You just said the Ancients experienced
these storms every 20 to 30 years.

77
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:51,290
Atlantis必须设置一些预警措施.
Atlantis must have some precautions put in place.

78
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,751
以前,这里有防御系统的保护,
In the past, the ancients have
been protected by the shield,

79
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,087
要不就是在深深的海底,根本侵袭不到.
or submerged deep enough in the water not be affected.

80
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:58,756
好,除去这些呐.
Okay, strike those options.

81
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,675
还有什么方法?
What else have we got?

82
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,093
没有.
Nothing.

83
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:05,263
这的确是个威胁,这么强烈的风会带来很大的破坏.
If it's a real threat,
the high winds alone will wreak havoc.

84
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,975
来吧,伙计们,这座城市已经存在很久了.
Come on, guys, I mean, this city's
been around for a long time.

85
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:10,685
飓风的侵袭是不可避免的.
A storm surge is inevitable.

86
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:13,187
别在说什么在它袭击我们之前转移,
Not to mention the fact that by moving
over a land mass just before hitting us,

87
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,899
飓风和电击的可能性都很大.
the likelihood of tornadoes and
electrical activity is greatly increased.

88
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,901
这就是Atlantis.
This is Atlantis.

89
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,405
我的意思是我们可以控制...
I mean, we've got to be able to handle that...

90
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:24,240
是么?
Right?

91
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,409
不.
No.

92
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,702
为什么不?
Why not?

93
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,496
因为建造这座城市的人知道,他们有力量
The people who built this city
knew they had a force field

94
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,081
可以控制自然的一切,
capable of holding back anything mother nature,

95
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,625
或者,这样,幽灵才会受挫.
or, for that matter, the Wraith could throw at them.

96
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,379
除去这层保护,
Atlantis显然是很不堪一击的.
Without that protection,
Atlantis is remarkably fragile.

97
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,133
根据我们的保守估计,也会造成大面积的结构损伤.
Even our conservative calculations
project widespread structural damage.

98
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,468
洪水会将整个城市淹没.
Flooding could sink the city entirely.

99
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,388
像Atlantis如此巨大的东西沉没会怎样?
How could something as big as Atlantis just sink?

100
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,267
我相信Titanic上的乘客们业在问自己同样的问题.
I'm sure the passengers on the Titanic
were asking themselves the same question.

101
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,436
是的,还是不要了.
Yes, well, let's not.

102
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:57,899
那么,如果我和Teyla没有发现这个的话要怎么办...
So, what you're saying is if Teyla and
I hadn't discovered this...

103
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,526
那我们的麻烦就更大了.
We would be in even bigger trouble.

104
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,907
好吧,那现在怎么办?
All right, what's the plan?

105
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:11,162
根据我的计算,飓风还有12个小时就会侵袭我们,所以,嗯...
By my calculations, we have just under 12 hours
until the storm hits, so, uh...

106
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,956
让我们来好好计划一下.
We plan to have a plan... Yeah.

107
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,666
那么.
By then.

108
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,423
我们需要好好计划一下如何撤退,
We need to start investigating evacuation plans,

109
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,800
包括大陆的和海外的.
both on the mainland, and off-world somewhere.

110
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,677
你知道的,McKay可能会有些什么主意.
You know McKay will come up with something.

111
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,763
他一直认为自己是个英雄.
He's just setting himself up to be a hero.

112
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:32,642
是的,可能Rodney 才是,
但是Zelenka博士, 他真的很关心.
Yeah, well, maybe Rodney is,
but Dr. Zelenka, he seemed genuinely concerned.

113
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,602
所以我的计划就是
So my orders are to come up with

114
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,146
找到一个友好的星球,可以让我们避一个晚上.
a friendly planet that wouldn't mind
putting us up for the night.

115
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:37,980
正确.
Exactly.

116
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,149
加上Ford, 看看你们能弄出点什么.
Take Ford, see what you can work out.

117
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,370
老实说我不是干这个的正确人选.
I don't really have the right boots for this.

118
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,790
我是过来这边给小孩子们接种疫苗的.
I was just meant to come out here
and inoculate some wee babies.

119
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:58,125
在飓风到来之前,我们需要尽可能多的帮助.
We need all the hands we can spare before it comes.

120
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,253
这场飓风不仅会毁了我们的庄稼,
This storm could not only destroy our crops,

121
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,171
我们的居所可能也会被刮走.
our settlement could be washed away.

122
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,673
如果只有很少的人留下...
If just a few of us were to remain...

123
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,675
庄稼可以再种,房子可以再造...
Crops can be replaced and homes rebuilt...

124
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,343
但是人不能再生.
People can't.

125
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,388
这就是为什么我们现在一定要竭尽所能.
Which is why we must do what we can now.

126
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,810
正确.
Right.

127
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:29,115
所有的Atlantis人?
The entire population of Atlantis?

128
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,492
基本上是吧.
At most, yes.

129
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,953
只是一两天.
Only for a day or two.

130
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,955
至少大多数.
At most.

131
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,208
很高兴可以用我们的粮食跟你们交换...
We are happy to trade with you
for a share of our crops...

132
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,918
但是这个.
But this.

133
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,631
我知道这个要求过分了点...但是,求您了.
I know it's a lot to ask, but... I'm asking.

134
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,968
那么你怎么回报我们?
What do you offer in return?

135
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,679
我们欠您一次人情.
I guess we'd owe you one.

136
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,098
一个什么?
One what?

137
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,058
一个要求.
A favor.

138
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,937
看,我们现在有麻烦.
Look, we're in trouble.

139
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,480
如果你是我们的朋友,那么请帮助我们.
If you're our friend, you'll help.

140
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,901
如果不是,那么现在告诉我,我会去找其他人.
If not, tell me now so I can ask somebody else.

141
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,529
但是还有谁会接受这么多人?
But who else would take in so many?

142
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,785
我希望得到一些有价值的回报.
I want something of value in return.

143
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,288
哦,当然,不是么?
Oh, you do, do you?

144
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,875
你知道的,我们可以去找没有人住的星球.
You know, we can go find any uninhabited planet.

145
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,294
它们都有不适合居住的理由,少校,
They're usually uninhabited for good reason, Major,

146
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,297
这点你和我一样清楚,
否则现在你不会在这里.
and you know that as well as I do,
or you would not be here.

147
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,968
当然,你也可以找到其他的星球接受你们...
Still, I'm sure you could find
another world to take you in...

148
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,387
但是你们没有时间了.
You're just so short on time.

149
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,307
如果有天你碰到困难
One day you're going to run across a problem

150
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,726
你也会需要我们的帮助.
and you're going to need our help.

151
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,395
不是么,中尉?
Isn't that right, Lieutenant?

152
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,939
是的,长官.
Yes, sir.

153
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,984
我们需要很多飞船和武器.
We've got lots of ships
and weapons we can... help with.

154
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,365
你在说我们要不是朋友要不...
You're telling me we can either be your friends or...

155
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,117
我比较喜欢朋友.
I much prefer friends.

156
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,204
这个对我比较有价值.
That is of value to me.

157
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,127
一晚上,两个最好的.
One night, two tops.

158
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,004
我们会自己带毯子的.
We'll bring our own blankets.

159
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,841
很好.
Very well.

160
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,385
你们可以运送你们的人来了.
You may send your people.

161
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,971
不会忘记的.
This won't be forgotten.

162
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,598
我们马上回去告诉所有人这个好消息.
We'll go back and tell everybody the good news.

163
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,392
要是有什么新消息我们会马上告诉你的.
I'll send word once we know more.

164
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,185
我等着.
I look forward to it.

165
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:34,907
不,不,不,不,不,
No, no, no, no, no,

166
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,118
- 我已经想到了.
- 他可能有点想法.
- I've already thought of that.
- He may be onto something.

167
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,495
我想到了,他不是...
I've already thought of it! It doesn't...

168
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,913
是的,这个naquadah能量发生器
Yes, the naquadah generators

169
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,040
可以给城市里选定的区域提供能量,
could be used to power select sections of the city,

170
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,419
但是，当你为了保护他们,而将他们从需要被保护的区域中减去的话.
but when you subtract the areas that need
to be secured just to protect themselves,

171
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,129
剩下的能量,什么也保护不了
it doesn't leave much power to shield anything else

172
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,922
这座城市会因为潮汐的力量而分开.
and the city breaks apart
because of the tidal stresses.

173
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,757
我们可以将他们重新组合,
把他们连得更紧.
Well, we could relocate some of them,
put them closer together.

174
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,802
没错,如果我们有奇妙的可以让减慢时间速度的工具.
You're right.
If only we had a magical tool to slow down time.

175
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,138
我傻傻的把那个留在地球上了,你带了你的么?
I foolishly left mine on earth.
Did you bring yours?

176
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,014
你知道...
You know...

177
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,558
你这个样子让人不舒服, McKay.
You're not pleasant when you're like this, McKay.

178
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,852
- 我一直是这样的.
- 没错.
- I'm always like this.
- My point exactly.

179
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,065
Smeadon和Manarians同意接受我们了.
Well, I've got a green light
from Smeadon and the Manarians.

180
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,194
但是我们要是一直不走,就不知道他们会怎样了.
I'm not sure how pleased he'll be
if we get stuck there, though.

181
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,864
不会发生这种事情的,不是么?
That's not going to happen, right?

182
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,241
当然不会.
我们还可以去其他星球.
Of course it's not.
We can always gate off to another planet.

183
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,951
令人安慰. 谢谢.
Comforting. Thank you.

184
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,204
你确定大陆上没有其他地方可去了么?
Are we sure there's no part
of the mainland we could go to?

185
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,539
在飓风来的路上我们探索了每个角落.
Everywhere that we have explored
is in the path of the storm.

186
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,541
尽管如此,我们的人已经开始撤退了.
My people are evacuating even now.

187
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,084
还是Ford对.
Still, Ford's right.

188
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,794
大陆只有北美这么大.
The mainland is the size of North America.

189
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,214
你的意思是整块大陆都会遭到飓风的侵袭?
You're telling me
the entire continent is going to get hit?

190
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,716
我轻易不欠Smeadon一个人情.
I'd rather not owe Smeadon any favors.

191
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:37,678
如果我们失去了Atlantis,我们就只能待在大陆上,无法进入星际之门.
If we lose Atlantis, we'll be stuck
on the mainland without any access to the Stargate.

192
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,597
McKay会想到办法的.
McKay will come up with something.

193
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,142
我会努力想的,但我也不是超人啊.
I will try, but despite what
you all may think, I am not Superman.

194
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,648
还有人也这么认为么?
Was anyone seriously thinking that?

195
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,443
不,长官.
No, sir.

196
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,653
不.
Never.

197
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,529
好的.
Fine.

198
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,199
我的观点是飓风会侵袭大陆70%的区域
Atlantis也不安全.
My point is the storm will affect over 70%
of the mainland, and Atlantis isn't safe either.

199
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,409
如果你不想有人伤亡,那就得把他们弄出去.
If you want everyone to live, you gate them off-world.

200
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,937
2号中转站, 准备接受发送.
Relay station two, prepare receive transmission.

201
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,942
R.S.2 准备发送. 完毕.
R.S.2 awaiting transmission. Over.

202
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,947
我需要你给Genii的Cowen传个消息.
I need you to relay a message to Cowen, of the Genii.

203
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,535
跟他说我们有个交易.
Tell him we have something to trade.

204
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,709
应该更快.
This could be going faster.

205
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,502
我们的人是猎人, 中尉.
Our people are hunters, Lieutenant.

206
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,421
很多人从很远的地方赶来.
Many are returning from great distances.

207
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,340
还有人不愿意离开.
Others do not want to leave the settlement.

208
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,176
他们知道这会有多严重.
They know how serious this is.

209
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:03,806
就算是我也很难相信这个飓风会有多可怕
Even I would have a hard time believing
in the strength of this coming storm

210
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,766
如果不是在太空中亲眼见到.
if I did not see it from space.

211
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,727
好吧,想办法让他们快点.
Yeah, well, do what you can to speed things up.

212
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,692
在Czech Republic
我们就不用对付飓风了.
In the Czech Republic
we don't have to deal with hurricanes.

213
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,527
在加拿大我们也不会常遇上这个...
We don't get that many in Canada either...

214
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,404
曾经有个叫做"Hazel."的
Once something called "Hazel."

215
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,488
Hazel?
Hazel?

216
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,741
- 40年前.
- 挺有趣的.
- Forty years ago.
- That's interesting.

217
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,783
也不是啦.
Not really.

218
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,660
不,不是这样的.
No, not really.

219
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,537
我有一次差点被闪电击中.
I was once almost struck by lightning.

220
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,457
闪电?
Lightning?

221
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,051
我们无法得到防御系统的一个阻碍是什么?
What is the one thing keeping us from having a shield?

222
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,094
- 是...
- 能量.
- That would...
- Power.

223
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,388
那么一个从地底升起mega飓风拥有最多的是什么?
And what does a mega-storm from hell have lots of?

224
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,598
能量.
Power.

225
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,974
以怎样的形式?
In the form of?

226
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,101
你想造个大风车.
You want to build a windmill.

227
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,394
电能.
Electricity.

228
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,356
Atlantis是可以经受电击的.
Atlantis is designed to withstand
substantial lightning strikes.

229
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,024
城市到处都有避雷针.
There are lightning rods all over the city.

230
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,860
这些针将电引入四个主要的地下站.
Those rods are channeled
into four main grounding stations.

231
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,697
是的,反过来,这四个地下站将电导入大海
Yes, in turn, those grounding stations
discharge electricity back into the ocean,

232
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,784
使得Atlantis免于遭受由于闪电带来的强力电击.
keeping Atlantis safe from massive
electric shocks due to lightning strikes.

233
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:08,120
现在,大部分的走廊都铺设了超导材料,
Now, many of the hallways are lined with a
superconductive material that allows a safe,

234
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,039
使得城内的能量可以转化为安全的低压.
low voltage transfer of power throughout the city.

235
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,083
- 这当然就意味着...
- 我明白了,我明白了.
- Which, of course means...
- I'm getting there, I'm getting there.

236
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,544
如果没有地下站
Let's say the grounding stations weren't around,

237
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,003
每次闪电电击城市的时候,
every time lightning struck the city,

238
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,755
这些走廊就会充满电.
those halls would become supercharged.

239
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,048
等等,你想...
So wait, you want...

240
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,425
如果我们可以停止地下站...
If we could disable the grounding stations...

241
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,593
如果可以.
Which we think we can.

242
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,928
每次闪电电击城市的时候,
Every time lightning struck the city,

243
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,139
Atlantis会承受一个瞬间的巨大能量.
Atlantis would experience
a momentary massive power surge.

244
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,225
- 现在能量...
- 如果正确导入...
- Now, that energy...
- If it's channeled correctly, though...

245
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,601
是的,它们当然会被正确导入,
Yes, of course if channeled correctly,

246
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,896
就可以启动防御系统了.
could conceivably be used to
charge up the shield generator.

247
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,440
现在,飓风越强烈,能量就会越多
Now, the more severe the storm,
the more energy is produced

248
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,192
防御系统就可以运行更长时间.
and the longer we can keep the shield running.

249
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,986
哦,这真是个天才的计划.
Yeah, it's an ingenious plan, really.

250
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,237
我不得不同意.
I'm compelled to agree.

251
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,823
唯一的缺点是如果我们没有办法储存所有的能量.
The only downside is we have no way of
storing all that energy.

252
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,492
啊,一旦飓风停止,闪电停止...
Ah, once the storm stops and
the lightning stops striking...

253
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,786
我们就无法再运行防御系统.
Yeah, we have no way of charging up the generator.

254
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,454
那我们就退回到以前.
Then we're back to square one.

255
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,039
那这个城市就可以逃过一截了么?
So the city would survive?

256
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,499
90%的机会.
I'd give us better than 90%.

257
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,208
70.
70.

258
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,293
80% 的机会.
80% chance.

259
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,794
好吧,我们还是会继续转移.
Okay, so we should still evacuate.

260
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,754
的的,但不是因为Zelemka的悲观.
Yes, but not just because of Zelemka's pessimism.

261
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,672
Zelenka.
Zelenka.

262
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,842
如果这个计划成功,那么这个城市就会变得高度依赖电力.
If the plan works, the city will become
highly charged with electricity.

263
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:07,638
一旦闪电开始,唯一安全的地方是控制室.
The only safe place to be once the lightning
begins to strike is in the control room.

264
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,183
我们需要把所有人都转移出去在飓风到来之前
We need to evacuate everyone
off-world until the storm passes

265
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,894
同时用尽可能少的人执行计划.
and execute the plan with the smallest team possible.

266
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,353
好的.
Okay, good.

267
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,771
开始吧.
Get on it.

268
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,480
好的.
Right.

269
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,565
地下站.
The grounding stations.

270
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,025
不,我想我们应该先去能量发送站.
No, I think we should go to
the power distribution centers first.

271
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,193
啊,不错.
Ah, good point, good call.

272
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,485
我在超越自己.
I'm getting ahead of myself.

273
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,029
是,好的,所有...
Yeah, okay, so...

274
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,871
Kolya长官...
Commander Kolya...

275
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,875
Cowen首领说要马上见你.
Chief Cowen needs to see you immediately.

276
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,335
我在训练的时候不想被打扰.
I am not to be disturbed while training.

277
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,963
他说马上,长官.
He said "immediately", Sir.

278
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,358
还没有转过来么?
Still haven't turned up yet?

279
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,484
恐怕是的.
I'm afraid not.

280
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,652
他们在打猎.
They are on a hunting mission.

281
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,238
没人能告诉他们撤退的消息.
No one has been able to get
them word about the evacuation.

282
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,531
多少?
How many again?

283
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,240
3个.
Three.

284
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,491
2个男孩和一个年轻女人.
Two boys and a young woman.

285
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,911
为什么我们不驾驶探险号去找他们?
Why don't we just take our Jumper and go find them?

286
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,955
他们在很深的森林里,就算可以找到他们,
They are hunting in dense vegetation.
Even if we were able to locate them,

287
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,498
我们也无法着陆.
we would be unable to land.

288
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,252
探险者3号已经装满准备走了,你或许应该--
Jumper three is loaded and ready to go.
Maybe you should just--

289
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,086
直接走.
Just go.

290
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,214
我继续等他们.
I will stay behind and give the hunters more time.

291
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,925
我和你一起.
I'll stay with you.

292
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,886
好吧,我明白了.
Okay, I get the point.

293
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,055
我们等.
We'll wait.

294
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,638
- 他们还没准备好.
- 当然没有.
- They're not ready.
- Of course they are.

295
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,728
你命令我训练一队男人,
You commissioned me to train a group of men who,

296
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,897
在最困难的一天保护这些东西
on their most treacherous day,
guarded this facility

297
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,067
或者执行一些侦察的任务.
or performed some sort of reconnaissance mission.

298
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,153
他们现在还不行.
They are not yet a strike force.

299
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,240
这个机会很难得.
This is the rarest of opportunities.

300
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:18,287
之后的一个小时内,Atlantis里只会有不足10个的人,而且大部分都是科学家.
Within the next hour, there will be less than
10 people on Atlantis, most of them only scientists.

301
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,706
你肯定可以完成任务.
Now, surely you can accomplish our goals

302
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,834
并在暴风到来之前顺利撤退.
and get out before the storm hits.

303
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,961
如果一切顺利...
If all goes well...

304
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,339
但是我们在训练的时候不会假设一切都进行的很顺利.
But we don't train assuming all will go well.

305
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,217
我们不可以错失这个机会.
We cannot afford to pass up this opportunity.

306
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,844
如果你需要我的意见.
You wanted my opinion.

307
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,470
我已经说了.
I gave it to you.

308
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,930
而且我认为这个意见...
And I value that opinion...

309
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:42,979
但是Atlantis人手中拥有大量的资源,这些资源对于我们对抗幽灵非常重要 .
But the Atlantians are in possession of materials
that are vital to our goal of defeating the Wraith.

310
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,272
我们需要它们.
We need them.

311
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,316
我需要它们.
I need them.

312
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,738
让你的人做好准备吧.
Ready your strike force.

313
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,637
就是他们.
That's everybody.

314
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,141
还有4个半小时,飓风就要来了.
We've got just over four and a half hours
until the storm hits.

315
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,101
我们去实验室.
Let's get down to the labs.

316
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,732
探险者2号的人一到,立刻疏散他们.
Evacuate the people on in-bound
Jumper two as soon as they come in.

317
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:28,941
遵命,长官.
Yes, sir.

318
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,121
现在,我总算是习惯它的味道了.
I'm finally at the point where
I don't mind the taste of it.

319
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,373
我一直吃这个.
I was raised on this brew.

320
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,043
我已经不记得其他东西的味道了.
It burned away whatever taste sense I had.

321
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,297
所以...
So...

322
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:55,301
你觉得你会教我们的农夫一点什么么?
You think you can teach our farmers a thing or two?

323
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,346
是的是的,这就是我说的,是的.
Yes, yes, that's what I was saying, yes.

324
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:03,059
大多数人认为中庄稼就是要有好的种子
Most people think that farming is planting good seed

325
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,561
在肥沃的土地上.
in well-tilled soil, which it is.

326
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,981
的确如此,但是还需要其他的东西.
It is, but there's also more.

327
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:12,401
这些东西...就在这儿.
And that knowledge is... Here.

328
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,530
那么你想用这些奇妙的知识
And you want to trade these marvelous skills

329
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,823
来交换我的一块土地么.
in an exchange for a piece of my land.

330
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,325
没错.
I do.

331
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,619
我觉得我还要需要更多东西.
I think I'll need something more.

332
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,672
你是谁?
Who are you?

333
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,759
告诉我密码.
Tell me the sequence of numbers to enter in this device.

334
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,095
我不能说.
I can't tell you that.

335
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,224
为了这个去死不值得.
It isn't worth dying for.

336
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,560
你不会明白的.
You don't understand.

337
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,689
需要我的手纹才能开.
It's my hand that you need to put in the code.

338
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,524
这就是它的原理.
That's how it works.

339
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,818
Atlantis 的防御系统就会减弱?
And the shield of the Atlantis Stargate will be lowered?

340
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,361
是的.
Yes, yes.

341
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,030
这是什么?
What is this?

342
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,198
他们是谁?
Who are they?

343
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,449
带他进去.
Bring him to the Gate.

344
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,784
他们是朋友, Doran.
They are friends, Doran.

345
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,661
让他把密码输进去.
Make sure he will enter the code.

346
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,413
他会的.
He will.

347
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,041
照他说的做,我们就会看到那块大陆了.
Do as they say, and we'll see about that piece of land.

348
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:22,138
你帮了Genii一个大忙,我们会奖励你的.
You have done a great service
for the Genii and will be rewarded.

349
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,820
现在,这儿有几十个,
甚至可能上百个避雷针
Now, there are dozens,
possibly hundreds of lightning rods

350
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,113
分布在城市的四周.
placed strategically around the city.

351
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:39,906
等等.
Wait a sec.

352
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,908
- 怎么了?
- 为什么?
- What?
- Why?

353
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,784
什么为什么?
Why what?

354
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,495
为什么城市的周围会有上百只避雷针?
Why are there hundreds of lightning rods
placed around the city?

355
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:48,164
防御系统不是就可以对抗闪电了么?
Wouldn't the shield protect against lightning?

356
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,250
是的,是的,但是一直启动防御系统只有一个结果...
Yes, yes, it would, but running the shield
all the time is only good for one thing...

357
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,543
把能量耗尽.
Draining power.

358
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,247
正确.
Right.

359
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,796
你应该很清楚时间的重要性,对吧?
You're aware that there is a time element
to what we're doing here, right?

360
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,381
是的,我注意到了.
Yes, it's been brought to my attention.

361
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,299
就像我说的...
Like I was saying...

362
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,717
有避雷针,
There are lightning rods,

363
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,594
城市四周,到处都是.
a lot of them, placed all over the city.

364
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:04,180
这样的话,他们所捕获的所有能量
Now, as it stands right now,
all the energy they capture

365
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,474
全部会被传送进四个地下站.
is routed into four main grounding stations.

366
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,560
接着,地下站会将所有的能量传送进我们脚下的大海.
In turn, these stations ground
all that energy into the ocean below us.

367
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,521
所以,我们不要让电量传送到地下...
So instead of sending electricity to ground...

368
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:12,980
我们用他来启动我们的防御系统.
We use it to power the shield.

369
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:13,731
怎么做?
How?

370
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,274
将它们导入Atlantis的走廊
By directing it right down the corridors of Atlantis

371
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,817
然后进入能量发生器.
and into the shield generators.

372
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,152
能做到么?
The city can handle that?

373
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,363
是的,理论上可以.
Yes, theoretically.

374
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,698
就像,恐龙理论上也可以变成鸟???
Like, dinosaurs turned into birds "theoretically,"

375
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,159
或者就像相对论,所谓的理论上.
or theory of relativity "theoretically?".

376
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:26,911
什么?
What?

377
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,622
呃....差不多吧
Elizabeth...
Uh... somewhere in between.
Elizabeth...

378
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,333
你负责2号地下站,
You take grounding station two,

379
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,793
我负责一号.
I'll take grounding station one.

380
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,379
少校,你负责3号和4号.
Major, you take stations three and four.

381
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,714
什么,等等,3号和4号在哪里?
Whoa, wait a sec, where are stations three and four?

382
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,299
这里和这儿.
Here and here.

383
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,551
那我们在...
And we are...

384
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,760
是的,这里.
Here, yes.

385
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,054
我们必须要快,这样 我才能开始设置主要程序,
I need to get done quickly so
I can start working on the sub-routines,

386
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,681
Elizabeth 抱怨她的膝盖...
and Elizabeth was complaining about her knee...

387
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,723
等等.
Whoa, wait a second.

388
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,934
这些东西是不是类似一个传送器?
Are these things even close to a transporter?

389
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,602
是的,Elizabeth的是这样的.
Uh, yes, Elizabeth's is.

390
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,104
那我的呢?
And mine?

391
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,939
这是个轻松的旅程.
It's a brisk walk away.

392
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,692
你说的轻松是指很远吧?
And by brisk you mean far?

393
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,610
我说的漫步是要用跑的.
And by walk I mean run.

394
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,028
好吧.
Okay.

395
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,030
你到达第一个站的时候跟我们联系.
You'll need to radio in
once you've gotten to your first station.

396
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,992
知道了,开始吧.
All right, let's do it.

397
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,999
快,行动!
Hurry! Move!

398
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,083
这边!
Come this way!

399
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:19,839
你还好么,还好么?
Are you okay? You okay?

400
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:20,882
他们来了.
Here they come.

401
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,884
好了,坐好,系好安全带.
Okay, just sit here.
Strap in as best you can.

402
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,385
这一路上会很颠簸.
It's going to be a real bumpy ride.

403
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,096
好吧,我们走吧.
All right, let's get out of here.

404
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,890
我不确定这是个好主意.
I'm not so certain that's such a good idea anymore.

405
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,720
什么?看外面.
What?
Look at it out there.

406
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:33,102
就算是Sheppard少校也搞不定 .
Even major Sheppard would have
a hard time flying through this.

407
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:34,228
我们准备好了.
We are ready.

408
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,730
我想我们还是等等好了.
I think it's best that we wait it out.

409
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,523
在这还挺安全的.
We're safe as long as we're in here.

410
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,734
我们有吃的,也有水.
We've got rations, and there's plenty of water.

411
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,527
是啊,特别是相对于外面来说.
Yeah, especially outside.

412
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,992
很好.
Very well.

413
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,076
希望你是对的,博士.
I hope you are right, Doctor.

414
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,412
如果你错了,我们就没有机会再选了.
We won't have a chance to change
our minds if you are wrong.

415
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,584
这挺舒服的.
It'll be cozy.

416
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,865
我到了!
I'm here!

417
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,536
我跟你说了到达第一个站的时候跟我联络, 少校.
I told you to contact me when you got
to the first one, Major.

418
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:35,164
我在第一个, Rodney.
I am at the first one, Rodney.

419
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:38,376
哦,抱歉,我刚搞定.
Oh, sorry, I'm already done mine.

420
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,294
哦,很好,.
Oh, great, good for you.

421
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:41,796
我也是.
Me too.

422
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,131
大家都好.
Good for everyone.

423
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,384
你现在在哪里?
Where are you now?

424
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,886
我在该死的地下站.
I'm at the damn grounding station.

425
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,054
不,不,不,不是说你.
No, no, no, no, not you.

426
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,472
我在传输器这里.
I'm in the transporter.

427
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:55,393
你在那里.
There you are.

428
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,477
我在这儿.
There I am.

429
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,312
很高兴大家都很顺利.
Glad everybody is having such a good time.

430
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,146
我现在该怎么做?
What do I do?

431
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,440
控制台上应该有一个按键台.
There should be a key pad right
on the console of the station.

432
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:10,449
看到了.
Got it.

433
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:14,453
输入 0-3-1-5-4-7在远古时代的替代语.
Punch in the ancient equivalent of 0-3-1-5-4-7.

434
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:24,172
就这样?
That do it?

435
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,257
是的.
Yep.

436
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,181
好了,搞定3个,还差一个.
Good, three down, one to go.

437
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,640
他们的密码好像都一样,
They all seem to have the same separation code,

438
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,642
呃,现在去最后一个,重复这个操作程序,
so, uh, get to the next one, repeat the procedure,

439
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,477
我们在控制室汇合.
we'll meet you in the control room.

440
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,062
Roger那是.
Roger that.

441
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:44,066
熏肉.
Bacon.

442
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:46,444
你想要带的是熏肉?
The one thing you wish you'd brought with you is bacon?

443
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,363
吃了这个,你就会觉得其他东西都很美味.
It's the food that makes other food worth eating.

444
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:52,116
你想把熏肉带着去另外一个星系?
You wish you brought bacon to another galaxy?

445
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,534
是的,你问我...
Yes, you asked me...

446
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,536
让其他的东西变得美味.
Off-world activation.

447
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,080
Weir博士说明天之前应该不会有人到.
Dr. Weir said no one should be
coming back until tomorrow.

448
00:24:58,623 --> 00:24:59,999
有人袭击了Manara.
There's been an attack on Manara.

449
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,502
有伤员回来,减弱防御系统.
We have wounded incoming!
Lower the shield.

450
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,420
他们在用Athosian IDC.
They're broadcasting an Athosian IDC.

451
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:06,464
拜托,否则就迟了.
Please! Before it's too late.

452
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:08,216
我们正在减弱防御系统.
We are lowering the shield.

453
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,800
嗯,我们应该经过Weir博士的同意.
Whoa, we should get the okay from Dr. Weir.

454
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,303
他们被袭击了,减弱防御系统吧.
They're under attack.
Lower the shield.

455
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:17,016
Weir博士,好像 Manara受到了袭击.
Dr. Weir, there's been some sort of attack on Manara.

456
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,685
有一小队受了伤的athosian.
We have an athosian party incoming with wounded.

457
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,521
我们正在路上.
We're on our way.

458
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,114
出什么事情了?
What happened?

459
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,783
他们怎么到处都是!
真不敢相信他们没把我们都干掉.
They were everywhere!
I can't believe they didn't kill us all.

460
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:34,784
谁?
Who?

461
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,718
守住这个房间.
Secure the room.

462
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:00,768
只有把这些人制伏就可以了.
These men could have been overpowered.

463
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,563
我们需要和Atlantis人合作.
We need the Atlantians to be cooperative.

464
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,275
守住房间.
Secure the room.

465
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:10,653
把入口守好.
Cover the entrances.

466
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,630
看起来有伤员回来了.
Apparently there's wounded incoming.

467
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:32,383
没什么意义.
That doesn't make any sense.

468
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:33,801
你是说和幽灵有关?
They said it was Wraith-related?

469
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:37,388
一会我们自己去问他们.
等等.
We'll ask them ourselves in a second.
Hold on.

470
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:40,725
大厅怎么了?
What the hell is going on?

471
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,906
Elizabeth Weir博士?
Dr. Elizabeth Weir?

472
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:57,283
是的?
Yes?

473
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:00,203
那么你一定是McKay博士了.
And you must be Dr. McKay.

474
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,041
没错.
That is him.

475
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,377
Sheppard少校呢?
Where is major Sheppard?

476
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:12,590
Sheppard在哪里.
I would like to know the whereabouts of major Sheppard.

477
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,510
你好像对我们很了解.
You seem to know a lot about us.

478
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:17,678
你是谁?
Who are you?

479
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,180
他们是Genii.
They're Genii.

480
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:21,766
你只需要知道一件事, Weir博士.
There's only one thing you need to know, Dr. Weir.

481
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:27,355
现在...,我们控制了 Atlantis.
As of right now... We are in control of Atlantis.

482
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,806
呼叫探险者2号, 我是Sheppard. 快回答我.
Puddle Jumper two, this is Sheppard. Come in.

483
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:04,892
探险者2号,收到么?
Jumper two, do you copy?

484
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:09,814
我是 Ford, 长官.
This is Ford, sir.

485
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,941
我们决定待在探险者2号里面,等风暴过了再回去.
We decided to wait out the storm in the Jumper.

486
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:13,651
你们还在大陆?
You're still on the mainland?

487
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:14,735
是的,长官.
Yes, sir.

488
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,863
嗯,我们这里出事了.
Well, we've got a situation, here.

489
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:19,824
据我所知,
一小队Genii武装力量闯了进来 .
From what I can ascertain,
a small Genii strike force has gated in.

490
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:22,201
Genii?
The Genii?

491
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,453
那些想让我们给他们原子弹的人?
The folks who wanted us to build them an A bomb?

492
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:25,454
是的,就是他们.
Yeah, that's them.

493
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:26,622
他们抓了Weir 和McKay 当人质.
They've got Weir and McKay hostage.

494
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,499
他们控制了入口.
They've also got control of the gate room.

495
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,002
没听清, 长官, 你刚才说人质?
You're breaking up, sir, did you say hostage?

496
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:32,378
没错.
Affirmative.

497
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:40,636
我们马上回去.
We're on our way.

498
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,305
你以为自己在干什么?
What do you think you're doing?

499
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,056
你听到他说的啦.
You heard him.

500
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,892
看看外面.
Take a look outside, hotshot.

501
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,393
我们无法飞回去的.
We're not flying through this.

502
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:49,187
McKay 和 Weir被抓了,博士.
McKay and Weir were taken hostage, Doc.

503
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,022
我没准备在这儿傻等着什么都不做.
I'm not just going to sit here and do nothing.

504
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,982
我们都不是专业的飞行员.
Neither one of us are real pilots.

505
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:56,485
如果说在一个小时前飞回去是个坏主意,那么现在就是一个愚蠢的决定.
If it was a bad idea an hour ago,
it's an idiotic one now.

506
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,779
我们会把握机会.
We'll going to have to take our chances.

507
00:28:58,905 --> 00:28:59,989
Beckett 博士说得对,中尉.
Dr. Beckett is right, Lieutenant.

508
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,158
我们现在对Sheppard少校毫无帮助 .
We are of no use to major Sheppard dead.

509
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,910
少校,我是Teyla.
Major, this is Teyla.

510
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:05,828
外面的风暴太猛了.
The hurricane is in full force outside.

511
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,955
我们可以试着起飞,
We could attempt to fly through it,

512
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:09,624
但是我很怀疑我们能飞回去,
but it is doubtful that we would
make it back to Atlantis,

513
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,959
我们还有3个年轻的乘客.
and we have three young passengers.

514
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,171
真糟糕.
That's bad news.

515
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:16,839
我很抱歉.
I am sorry.

516
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:17,965
我也是.
So am I.

517
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:19,717
你们就待在那里等风暴停止.
You stay put until it passes over.

518
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:22,178
- 长官, 我...
- 没问题的,中尉.
- Sir, I...
- It's okay, Lieutenant.

519
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,889
尽快赶回来就好.
Just get your ass back here as soon as you can.

520
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:26,682
我还可以撑一会.
I could use a little backup.

521
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,101
祝您好运,长官.
Good luck, sir.

522
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,679
你是谁?
Who are you?

523
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,141
Acastus Kolya司令,Genii人.
Commander Acastus Kolya, of the Genii.

524
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,732
Atlantis 真是特别...
This Atlantis is extraordinary...

525
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:18,734
跟我想象的完全不一样.
More than I ever imagined.

526
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:22,989
你把我们的其他人怎样了?
What have you done with the rest of my people?

527
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:26,075
我很肯定他们甚至不知道我们的到来.
I'm quite sure they have no idea we're even here.

528
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:27,368
那么他们是安全的?
Then they're safe?

529
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:29,412
是的.
Yes.

530
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:32,623
你们是如何通过防御系统的?
How were you able to bypass the shield?

531
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:38,045
多亏了那些陈年酿造的酒和这些没脑子的家伙.
With the time-tested combination
of strong drink and weak minds.

532
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:42,008
我以为我们大家是盟友.
There was a time when our two peoples
considered becoming allies.

533
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,803
为什么这么做?
Why are you doing this?

534
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,224
你们拥有我们非常需要的东西.
You are in possession of supplies we vitally need.

535
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:54,979
把这些给我们,我们就走,这很简单.
Hand them over, without difficulty,
and we leave peacefully.

536
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:57,273
否则呢?
Or?

537
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:00,568
我们都是聪明人, Weir博士.
We're both intelligent people, Dr. Weir.

538
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,532
我想没有必要向你们再次展示我的决心?
I'm sure there's no need for me to demonstrate
once again the strength of my resolve?

539
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:09,535
你们要什么?
Which supplies did you have in mind?

540
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:11,787
你们所有的 C-4炸药,
All of your stores of the C-4 explosive,

541
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,456
你们所有的药品,
all of your medical supplies,

542
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:16,626
还有从我们那里偷走的幽灵的数据装置...
the Wraith data device you stole from my people...

543
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,338
还有一艘你们的飞船.
And one of your ships.

544
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,465
就这些?
Is that all?

545
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:23,591
不.
No.

546
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:28,054
Sheppard少校呢?
Where is major Sheppard?

547
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:30,890
他在大陆.
He's on the mainland.

548
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,392
你要的那些东西并不容易准备.
What you're asking for isn't that easy.

549
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:37,355
我们正准备转换大量的能量为即将到来的风暴做准备.
We've had to divert a lot of power
in order to prepare for the storm.

550
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:41,067
军工厂的安全门已经关了,所以我们不能...
The armory safety doors have shut, which means we can't...

551
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:45,655
我们很明白,我知道你在撒谎.
just so we're clear, I know you're lying.

552
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:53,204
Elizabeth, 给他们.
Elizabeth, just give him what he needs.

553
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,831
如果他要C-4, 药品,
If he needs the C-4, the medical supplies,

554
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:57,708
还有幽灵数据装置,那么给他们.
and the Wraith data device, then just give it to him.

555
00:31:57,792 --> 00:31:59,502
不值得为了这些东西去死.
None of that is worth dying for.

556
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,009
离开控制台.
Step away from the console.

557
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:10,012
我明白了,我明白了.
I was leaning.
I was just leaning.

558
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:11,931
你们的要求很不合理.
Your request is unreasonable.

559
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:17,562
你们不可能需要我们所有的 C-4和药品.
You can't possibly need all our C-4,
or all our medical supplies.

560
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,648
你现在没有资格和我讨价还价.
You're in no position to tell me what
is reasonable and what is not.

561
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:24,735
我们怎么知道如果你得到你要的东西之后不会杀了我们?
How do we know that you won't kill us
once we give you what you need?

562
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,821
你不知道.
You don't.

563
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,700
告诉我的士兵们哪里可以找到我们要的东西.
Please show my men where they can find
what they're looking for.

564
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,719
你在这里干什么?
What are you doing here?

565
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:52,847
在我看来,我手上有人质.
From my understanding, I'm being held hostage.

566
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:55,516
我是说在这里,在Atlantis.
I mean here, in Atlantis.

567
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,852
你们为什么留下?
Why did some of you stay behind?

568
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:02,190
收拾残局
做些扫尾工作.
Tie up some loose ends.

569
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,358
比如说?
Like what?

570
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,778
你知道的,确保每个人都离开了.
You know.
Make sure everyone got out okay.

571
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:11,449
这些事情让其他人去做不就可以了么?
Isn't that the work of someone less important?

572
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:13,743
你不这么认为么?
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

573
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:18,331
你有什么计划吧?
You have a plan, don't you?

574
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:20,708
是的,我有很多计划.
Yeah, I've got lots of plans, about lots of things.

575
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,753
我对于你要拯救这个城市的计划比较敢兴趣.
I'm interested in the plan you have to save the city.

576
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,880
我没说过要拯救什么.
I never said anything about saving anything.

577
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:28,758
是还有没有.
Not yet.

578
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:05,086
Teyla Emmagan在哪里?
Where is Teyla Emmagan?

579
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:08,673
你认识 Teyla?
You know Teyla?

580
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,800
她在城里么?
Is she here, in the city?

581
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,220
不,不在.
No, she isn't.

582
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,141
你一定是Sora.
You must be Sora.

583
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:21,811
我看过Genii代表团的报告 .
I read the Genii mission report.

584
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:23,437
对于你父亲的事情我很抱歉.
I'm sorry about your father.

585
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:25,648
我会为他报仇的.
He will be avenged.

586
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,858
Teyla没有杀他.
Teyla didn't kill him.

587
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:27,942
不.
No.

588
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:30,570
- 她把他留在那里等死.
- 她没有其他选择了...
- She left him to die.
- She had no choice...

589
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:31,988
你说完了么?
Are you finished?

590
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:42,039
我们从幽灵的飞船上载下来的数据都在这个装置里面.
All of the information we downloaded
from the Wraith ship is still on this device.

591
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,416
他们对你做了什么?
What did they do to you?

592
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:27,710
我不想说,但是...
I tried to keep my mouth shut.
I tried, it's just I couldn't...

593
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:30,880
这是什么意思?
What is the meaning of this?

594
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:34,342
我真的不知道.
I honestly have no idea.

595
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:36,302
这是个通信器.
It's a radio.

596
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:38,846
箭头指向通话按钮.
The arrow points to the talk button.

597
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:42,308
我是Kolya司令.
This is commander Kolya.

598
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,643
Kolya...
Kolya...

599
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:45,645
这个名字很难念.
That's a hard name to pronounce.

600
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:47,730
是名么?
Is that a first name?

601
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:51,484
我是John Sheppard少校,
My name is major John Sheppard,

602
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:55,404
我把所有的C-4都藏起拉了,你们永远,我再说一次,永远也找不到.
and I have hidden the C-4
where you will never,I repeat, never, find it.

603
00:35:57,198 --> 00:36:00,284
除非我知道人质被安全释放
When I get confirmation that the prisoners
have been safely released

604
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:04,413
并且离开了 Atlantis,
我会告诉你们在哪里.
and allowed to gate off Atlantis,
I will help you find it.

605
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,165
他很好.
He is good.

606
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:07,291
没错.
Yes, he is.

607
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,126
我会照他说的做.
I'd do what he says.

608
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:11,170
你很大方,少校.
Your offer is very generous, Major.

609
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:12,463
没错.
Yes, it is.

610
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,299
但是, McKay 刚告诉我
However, Dr. McKay recently shared with me

611
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:17,468
你们有个拯救城市的计划.
there's a plan in action to save the city.

612
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:19,220
是么?
He did?

613
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:20,847
是的.
He did.

614
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:23,474
我知道还有最后一个地下站
My understanding is there is
one final grounding station

615
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:25,184
需要被停止.
that needs to be deactivated.

616
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:27,436
将3号站的避雷针拿走,
Uncouple the grounding rods at station three,

617
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:29,772
这样可以让防御系统重新运作
assist with the reactivation of the shield

618
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:32,316
那么你和你的朋友可以安全的离开这里.
and you and your friends can leave here, unharmed.

619
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:33,609
等等e.
Wait a minute.

620
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:36,362
我以为你要的是C-4和飞船.
I thought all you wanted was C-4 and a Jumper.

621
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:39,156
为什么不在你可以的时候控制这座城市呢,少校?
Why raid a city when you can seize it, Major?

622
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:41,701
Atlantis 要不就是我们的,要不就沉入大海...
Atlantis will be ours or the ocean's...

623
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:46,330
你选吧.
You choose.

624
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:59,093
少校还没有消息么.
We should have heard something from the major by now.

625
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:01,012
或许他已经没有计划了.
Perhaps he has not had the opportunity.

626
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:03,306
我不想知道这里发生的一切.
I don't like not knowing what's going on in there.

627
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:04,724
Genii为什么会袭击我们?
Why would the Genii attack us?

628
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:05,725
为什么是现在?
Why now?

629
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:07,768
我们没有及时的离开.
We didn't exactly leave on the best terms.

630
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,021
我的意思是,除了我们偷了他们的一些装置
I mean, beside from the fact that
we stole some of their gear

631
00:37:10,104 --> 00:37:11,898
没有把我们承诺过的C-4给他们,
and didn't hand over the C-4 we promised them,

632
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,275
他们认定Teyla干掉了两个他们最棒的家伙.
they're pretty convinced Teyla killed
one of their top guys.

633
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,818
他们错得真离谱.
They believe so falsely.

634
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:19,655
他们选择在我们最弱的时候偷袭我们一定不是巧合.
The fact that they chose our weakest hour
cannot be a coincidence.

635
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:23,117
一定有人告诉了他们我们现在很弱.
Someone must have told them that
we would be at a diminished capacity.

636
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,702
一定会有其他办法的.
There's got to be a way back.

637
00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:27,121
外面的风速有110里/时.
Those winds outside are blowing at 110 knots.

638
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:28,873
我们哪里也去不了.
We're not going anywhere, son.

639
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,437
谢谢你来看我.
Thank you for seeing me.

640
00:37:54,273 --> 00:38:00,237
这座城市是我们祖先设计居住并留给他们的后代的,
This city was designed to be inhabited by the Ancients
and their direct descendants, and although, yes,

641
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:04,408
但是对于不是他们后代的人来说,他们无法运用这个城市的大部分功能,
while there is limited functionality
for those who do not posses the ancient gene,

642
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,953
只有他们的后代才能操控整座城市.
it's only those who have it
who can revive this city to its true potential.

643
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:12,041
你是么?
And you have this gene?

644
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:14,251
不,但是我们的人里面很多都是.
No, but many of my team do.

645
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:18,756
幽灵正慢慢袭来.
The Wraith are slowly waking.

646
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:24,428
很快整个星系都将被卷入一场浩劫,我们谁都不愿意看到.
Soon this entire galaxy will be embroiled in a war
the likes of which our generations have never seen.

647
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:27,056
你加速了这场战争.
A war that you expedited.

648
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:30,434
和我们不同的意见没什么用.
Disagreements like ours will no longer matter.

649
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:35,230
我们唯一需要知道的就是如何备战,
The only thing of any consequence
will be how prepared we are,

650
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:37,983
如何防御.
and what defense we are able to mount.

651
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:42,279
现在,这座城市里有很多秘密可以帮助我们打赢这场战争...
Now, this city holds many secrets
which could help us win that war...

652
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,158
但是只有在我的人发现这些秘密的情况下.
But only if my team are here to discover them.

653
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:51,580
所以,拿走你想要的东西吧,如果你不将这座城市留下,
So fine, take whatever you need for your people,
but if you don't leave us this city,

654
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:54,083
你只是将自己送上死路.
you're only hurting yourselves in the long run.

655
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:59,004
你相信你的那些人,可是他们之中很多甚至不是这个星系的人,
You believe your people,
who are not even of this galaxy,

656
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:01,590
难道他们会比我们更接近ancients?
are closer to the ancients than we are?

657
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:05,094
你 傲慢的态度真是太过分了.
Your arrogance is astounding.

658
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:10,140
我们会掌控这座城市,我们会展开防卫,
We will take this city, we will mount a defense,

659
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:14,353
而且我们会赢,不需要你们的帮助,Weir博士.
and we will win, with or without your help, Dr. Weir.

660
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,980
长官,他现在在地下站.
Sir, he's at the grounding station.

661
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,330
在这里.
The commander is here.

662
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,998
他就站在这里,长官.
He's just standing there, sir.

663
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:36,709
待着别动.
Hold your position.

664
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,377
在他完成之前别接近他.
Do not approach until he's finished.

665
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:39,294
遵命,长官.
Yes, sir.

666
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,755
除非必要,不要开枪.
Use lethal force only if necessary.

667
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:43,716
你说过不会伤害他的.
You told him he would be unharmed.

668
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:47,136
希望他别做太多反抗.
Let's hope he doesn't put up much of a fight.

669
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,782
他停下了,他现在不在控制台周围了.
He's stopped.
He's not at the control panel anymore.

670
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:10,284
他正四处看.
He's looking around.

671
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:11,618
准备开火.
Hold your fire.

672
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:12,995
那些控制板很容易被破坏的.
Those control panels are pretty fragile.

673
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,580
你不会希望...
You might not want to...

674
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:05,798
让我来告诉你,你都做错了些什么, Kolya.
Let me tell you what you did wrong here, Kolya.

675
00:41:06,757 --> 00:41:09,134
a), 你失去了2个你的人...
a), you lost two of your men...

676
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:11,929
b)...
b)...

677
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:16,809
在我把避雷装置停止之前你把开关毁了...
You've damaged the switch before
I could separate the grounding rods...

678
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:19,853
我相信McKay会对此很吃惊...
Which I'm sure you're gonna
get an earful from McKay for...

679
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,023
还有, c)...
And, c)...

680
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:28,195
你毁了我对你最后的信任.
You lost all of what little
credibility you had with me.

681
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:31,699
你明白这意味着什么么?
Do you have any idea how big a setback that is?

682
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,200
我再也无法启动防御系统.
I may not even be able to activate the shield.

683
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:35,327
我不可能... 离开我!
I can't possibly... Get off me!

684
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,330
你干掉了2个我的人.
You killed two of my men.

685
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:40,249
我想我们也会.
I guess we're even.

686
00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:42,126
我不喜欢你.
I don't like you.

687
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,672
我还没说完.
I'm not finished yet.

688
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:48,882
我也没有.
Neither am I.

689
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:53,053
跟Weir博士告别吧.
Say goodbye to Dr. Weir.

690
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,140
这个城市有个自毁开关.
This city has a self destruct button.

691
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,934
如果你碰了她,我就启动.
You hurt her, I'll activate it.

692
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:01,145
没人会得到Atlantis.
Nobody'll get Atlantis.

693
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:05,482
就算如此, 少校,你也需要两个高级人员来启动它...
Even if it exists, Major, you need at least
two senior personnel to activate it...

694
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:09,778
而我现在准备送一个人上路.
And I'm about to take one of them out of the equation.

695
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:12,865
Kolya!
Kolya!

696
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,622
Kolya!
Kolya!

697
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,126
我给你一条船!
I'll give you a ship!

698
00:42:25,878 --> 00:42:28,547
我会离开!
I'll fly it out of here for you myself!

699
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:36,722
Kolya!


Kolya!
