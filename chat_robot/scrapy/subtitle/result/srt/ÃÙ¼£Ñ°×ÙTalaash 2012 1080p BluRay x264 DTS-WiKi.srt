觅迹寻踪

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,640
# 值此一夜 义无反顾 #

5
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:29,080
# 大街小巷迎接每一个行路之人 #

6
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,620
# 这是迷失灵魂的必经之路 #

00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,910
# 昨日浮现 莫名的街巷 飘落的花朵 #

12
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,920
# 逝去的时光如此甜美 #

13
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,620
# 如今只有心有所思 孤独前行 #

14
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,630
# 一举一动 看似随意 #

15
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,560
# 原来都因同一目的 #

16
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,400
# 却不知一切只是徒劳 #

17

# 在光亮和阴影之下 #

23
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,670
# 不幸的秘密挥之不去 #

24
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,680
# 为何它出现在此? #

25
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:13,580
# 为何怨念如此深重 不曾褪去 #

26
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,610
# 在深夜 请告诉我 #

27

当时马路上面只有那一辆车

马路上面什么也没有 长官

凌晨两点结束拍摄工作

收工! 阿尔曼 枪法不错

124
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,970
收工之后 他的司机和助理都不在他的身边
At that time his driver and his assistent were not with him.

125
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,760
你和他们谈过吗?

126
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,100
是的 我已经和他们谈过了 长官

127
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,090
他们说 收工之后

130
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,880
把他的所有的行李放回车里去

131
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,930
但是那一天
But on that day,

132
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,400
他让他们直接从摄影棚回家
he asked them to go home from the studio itself

133
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,740
他表示要自己开车离开

134
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,640
拉姆 
Ramu.

137
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,290
拉姆觉得有点奇怪 
Even Ramu felt it weired

138
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,230
因为阿尔曼不喜欢自己开车
becouse Armaan don't like driving car himself.

139
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,350
他几点从电影城离开的?

140
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,350
凌晨两点二十分

141
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,480
可是他在凌晨四点发生的车祸

What is the distance from Film City to Sipleas Road?

143
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,730

144
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,110
假设他用了四十五分钟的时间

那么在剩余的一个小时的时间里面 他在哪里?

这个案件属于机密案件

163

不得和媒体透露相关情况

164

没有办法结案

175
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,480

在过去的三四年时间里

在这条路上也发生过类似案件

178
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,310
所有的案件都是未解之谜 而且案情相似
All of them was unsolve mistery and their files very close.

179
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,980
没有人明白是怎么回事 也不需要去证明什么
Nobody could understand anything. There was nothing to prove, too.

180
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:22,030
也不全是你想的那样 至少我现在能明白案情
Well one thing for sure, I can understand now.

181
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,290

尼尔马拉 你要去哪里?

185

203
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,440

可以把水递给我吗?

212

不应该死得这么早

车的状况良好 刹车也没有问题
Car was in perfect condition, power breaks were good.

231
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:30,010

While breaking the staircase the car straight went into the ocean.

232
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,590
看来他当时想救什么人
It looks more like he was trying to save someone.

233
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,890
但是当时马路上没有任何障碍物
But there was nothing on the road

234
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,720
而且他也不是酒后驾车

235
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,910
是的 长官 他的检查报告里面
Yes sir, there was nothing found 

236
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,600
没有任何关于酒精中毒的信息
in his post mortem report of any toxication.

237
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,440
他的肺部积水过多 导致他溺水身亡
His lungs was full with water and he died of drawning.

238
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,400

Sonia,we still do not know where your husband when on that night,

270
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,180
也不知道他去那里做什么
or what was he doing on that road.

271
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,060
那车祸呢?

273
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,320
索尼娅女士 我冒昧问一句
Madam Sonia,forgive me for asking

274
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,110

他是不是有什么困扰?

督查 阿尔曼绝对不是自杀

他为什么自杀呢? 是你们没法结案 对吧?
Why will he kill himself? You guys cant solve the case, is it?

279
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:53,450
今天早上 我的会计师告诉我

283
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,580
你之前怎么没把这件事情告诉索尼娅?
Why didn't you tell Sonia about this?

284
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,310
长官 我当时想告诉她
Sir, I tried to tell her but

285
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,550
但是看她那么难过 所以我没有开口
she was in a shock,that's why I could not talk to her.

286
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,300
以多大的面值给的?
What kind of notes was it?

287
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,420
上千的面值 当时是装在美洲豹牌的绿色包里
In thousands, it was a green colour PUMA bag.

288
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,190
我们没有找到你说的提包
We did not find such bag.

289
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,400
那天晚上 你是不是偷看了他的东西?
That night you peeked his stuff right?

290
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,990
快说!

行李有一些音乐器材 午餐饭盒 
There were music system, lunch box 

292
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,410
还有会计师给的提包

293
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,450
是红色的吧?

294
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,670
不 长官 是绿色的包
No sir, it was green in colour

295
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,990
包里有什么? 你打开包看里面的东西了吗?
What was in that beg? Did you open and see it?

296
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,450
没有 长官 我不会不经过他的同意
No sir,I will never open his beg 

297
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,830
擅自看他包里的东西
without his permission.

298
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,920
真的吗?
Really?

299
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,120
没错 长官
Really sir.

300
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,640
他对你提起过那个包的事情吗?
Did Mr Kapoor tell anything about the bag?

301
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,400
没有 长官
No sir.

302
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,030
他原来这么干过吗?
Have he done this before?

303
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,600
是的 有过两次.
Yes, 2 times.

304
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,790
一年前 阿尔曼先生让我
1 year back Mr. Armaan did ask me 

305
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:15,860
把一百万卢比送到里多酒店
to deliver Rs 10 lakh to Hotel Lido...

306
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,610
这家酒店就位于发生车祸的那条马路
which is on the same road where his death tragic happen.

307
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,280
为什么?
Why?

308
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,710
我不知道 长官 他只是让我交给酒店前台
I do not know sir. I was just told to past it to the receptionist.

309
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,860
你们有个员工叫安纳德·穆鲁根吧?
You had a worker by the name of Anand Murugen?

310
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,300
穆鲁根...
Murugen...

311
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,270
他在你们酒店前台工作了四年
For 4 years he was you hotel receptionist.

312
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,480
是的 但是他辞职之后 
But he has resign 

313
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,970
我们就没有他的消息了
and after that we did not hear any news.

314
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,980
这是一个敲诈案件
It's extotion case.

315
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,570
如果当真如此 他肯定会对别人说起
If it's extotion im sure he would have talk to somebody.

316
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,960
就连他的妻子和关系好的朋友
Even his wife or any of his close friend 

317
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,180
也不清楚这件事情
do not knows anything.

318
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,530
敲诈可能和他的死亡有所关联
Got blackmail any relevance to his death.

319
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,110
但是好像并非如此
By right it should not.

320
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,030
证据很多 可是没有办法联系起来
There are many evidence whithout the right answer.

321
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,080
今天早上 她的妻子要求做最终检验记录
And today his wife filed F.I.R.

322
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,760
这是她唯一可以做的事情
This was the only thing left for her to do.

323
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,670
出动所有警力 调查这起案件
Get all my police force to investigate for this Hero's case.

324
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,750

330
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,600
我早已更换电话号码 长官

331
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,730
最近发生一点麻烦

332
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,600
那天晚上阿尔曼发生什么事情?

333
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,820
我对此毫不知情 我当时并不在现场
I do not know anything. I was not even there.

334
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,650
不要狡辩 警察已经知道两百万卢比的事情
Don't lie, police knows about the Rs 20 lakh.

335
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,620
其他问题!

336
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,660
我们现在可以谈谈工作吗?
Shall we talk about work now?

337
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,750
你应该给我五百万
You was suppose to pay me Rs 50 lakh.

338
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,080
还差三百万
There is still Rs 30 Lakh balance.

339
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,000
他们为什么让孩子们跟着这些影视音乐跳舞?
why are they making the kids dance with such filmy songs?

340
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,330
他们就不能教授其他课程吗?

341

孩子们跳得很好看
The kids were looking great dancing.

342
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,010
罗西尼... 罗西尼

343
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,720
这个疯婆子是谁?
Who is this crazy woman?

344
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,720
你好 亲爱的
Hello, dear.

345
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:40,590

This is my husband Suri and this is Frani our neighboor

347
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,260

348
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,990
噢 我之前见过你的哥哥
oh, I have met you brother before.

349
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,150
可怜的人
Poor you dear.

350
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,600
你们准备回家吗?
Are you guys going home?

351
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,190
是的
Yes.

352
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,430
你还好吗 苏尔扬?

353
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,980
我很好 怎么了?
I'm ok. Why?

354
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,510
没什么... 我实际上
No... I actcually wanted to meet you

355
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,720
我一直在等待机会
waiting for some time now.

356
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,780
我有个口信要带给你
I have a message for you.

357
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,180
口信? 谁的?
Message? From who?

358
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,790
你的儿子 卡伦
From you son, Karan.

359
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,470
他想我告诉你...
he wants me to tell you...

360
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,140
你在开什么玩笑?
What kind of joke is this?

361
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,180
不 不 听我说
No, no. Please listen to me.

362
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,740
卡伦想要我告诉你
Karan wants me to talk to you.

363
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,100
闭嘴! 闭嘴!
shut up! Just shut up!

364
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,910
我什么都不想听
I don't want to hear any more about it.

365
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,510
以后离我们远点 听明白了吗
You stay away from me hereafter, you understand?

366
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,530
给我滚远点
Stay the hell away from me.

367
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,030
我们走吧
Let's go.

368
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,490
他说 "告诉爸爸 我很好 不要担心"
He said "tell Dada that I'm fine and do not worry".

369
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,290
"告诉爸爸 我想和他谈谈"
"Tell Dada that I wish to talk to him."

370
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,260
她怎么知道卡伦以前叫你爸爸的?
How did she know that Karan use to call you Dada?

371
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:19,770
你之前说过 她到我们家 然后问东问西的
You told me once that she entered our house and was asking all kind of questions

372
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,480
但是我没有告诉她 关于卡伦的任何事情
But I did not inform her anything about Karan.

373
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,610
我不相信 有钱能使鬼推磨
I can't believe, for money sake people can act so weiredly.

374
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,190
如果她说的是事实呢?
How if she is telling the truth?

375
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,860
什么!
What!

376
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:41,170
如果她真的和卡伦说过话呢?
How if she really has spoken to Karan?

377
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:44,380
卡伦已经死了 罗西尼
Karen has past away, Roshini.

378
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,000
他不可能跟任何人说话
And he can't talk to anyone.

379
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,800
但是有些人可以通灵
But there are some people who can communicate with souls.

380
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,250
我在书上看到过
I have read in books.

381
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,250
你不应该相信这些 罗西尼
You should not believe in this kind of things, Roshini.

382
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,840
你应该成熟点
You are being a mature.

383
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,810
不要对我或者对你自己做这些
Please don't do this to me and to yourself.

384
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,310
就这一次 苏里 我们应该...
Just once, Suri. we should...

385
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,060
对不起 我不能再跟你继续这无稽的谈话
I'm sorry. I can't continue this unsensible talk with you.

386
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,180
这简直荒谬至极 我走了
It's too ridiculous. I'm going.

387
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,070
苏里! 就这一次 听听他吧  苏里!
Suri! please just for once, listen to him. Suri!

388
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,240
爸爸
Dada.

389
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,960
妈妈 我们能在附近玩一下吗?
Mama, can we go around?

390
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,920
当然可以
Ok, sure.

391
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,270
听着 卡伦! 不要走远 知道吗?
Listen Karan! Don't go so far, ok?

392
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,130
好的 当然
Ok, sure.

393
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,250
卡伦!
Karan!

394
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,770
苏里 快去找他
Suri, search for him.

395
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,340
卡伦!
Karan!

396
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,690
看来你十分渴望关爱
Looks like you are in need of love.

397
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,900
我可以让你所有的烦恼都消失
I can make all you worries diseapear.

398
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,520
去和别人说这些话吧
Please use this dialoge on some one else.

399
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,740
我是警察
I'm a cop.

400
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,580
在宵禁之前我还是可以做生意的
Got curfewed before I could even start my business.

401
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,130
没关系的 长官
It's doesn't matter,sir.

402
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,170
带上我一起吧
Please take with me.

403
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,960
你也可以抓我啊
You can also arrest me.

404
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,960
你已经堕落了 我何必再抓你
You are already in hell. Why must I arrest you?

405
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,390
我是堕落了 但是我知道通向天堂的路
I'm in hell, but I know the road to heaven.

406
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,260
从这里到里多酒店
From here straight into Hotel Lido.

407
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,980
在那里 每一个房间都是天堂
Over there in each room there is a heaven.

408
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,610
离这里很近的那个里多酒店吗?
Hotel Lido which is near here?

409
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,900
我和接待员的关系很好
I have a good connection with the receptionist.

410
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,620
他甚至都不会收我们房钱
He will not even charge us.

411
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,120
上车
Get in.

412
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,470
所有的男人都是一样的
All men are same.

413
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,140
你去里多几年了?
How many years you been going to Lido?

414
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,630
七年
7 years.

415
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,380
你知道穆鲁根吗?
Do you know Murugen?

416
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:37,390
安纳德·穆鲁根 他原来是那的一个接待员
Anand Murugen, he was the receptionist there.

417
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:39,520
为什么这么问?
Why?

418
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,980
我在找他
I'm searching for him.

419
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:46,230
我觉得没有人知道他在哪里
I feel nobody knows where he is.

420
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,860
大家都知道 他卖淫得病快死了
Everybody knows he is dying on the streets.

421
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,920
艾滋对我们来说可不是好事 长官
AIDS is not healty for our business, sir.

422
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,870
所以酒店经理炒了他
That's why the hotel manager fired him.

423
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,050
谢谢
Thank you.

你为什么赶我走 长官?

我对你还有价值

435
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,510
长官 我是达夫拉

穆鲁根说的是实话吗?
Is Murugen telling the truth?

444
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,860
警官 那个可怜的人就要死了 何必撒谎呢?

445
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,890

沙希现在有麻烦

你是一个优秀的喜剧演员

00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,830
你凭什么逮捕我?
On what reason will you arrest me ?

469
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:19,200
达夫拉 她的确是一个好的喜剧演员

00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,360
长官 这是达夫拉 沙希不在他老家

473
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,360
我就知道 他不会在那里

没关系 你回来吧

475
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:59,250
然后告诉警察派人看着他家
and inform the police there to keep an eye on his family.

476
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,090
不管有什么代价 我们都得找到他

先生 我要这味药

卡伦从小就喜欢玩水

480
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:14,390
我还记得

00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:19,480
在我准备跟他放水洗澡时

他总是非常开心

484
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:28,940
然后开怀大笑

485
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,450
他喜欢呆在水里
He liked to stay in the water.

486
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:45,300
他真的有可能是溺水身亡的吗?

487
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,840
对父母来说 没有什么比失去孩子更痛苦

有时天有不测风云

491
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,980
但是我们还是得继续活下去 知道吗?

492
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,940
有点耐心 罗西尼

After all, you also have you husband's support.

00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:24,210
那时 和卡伦在一起 差点让我失去了苏里
At that moment, together with Karan I have also lost Suri.

497
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,140
其实苏里比我更需要你的帮助
The truth is actually Suri needs your help more then me.

498
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,090

从不与人分享

500

他从不跟我说 甚至谈起卡伦

501
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:42,310
从不

00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,730
你觉得 他对这件事情不够在意吗?
Do you feel that he do not care about this thing?

503
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,530
他在意

504
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:00,160
如果他不在意的话 他晚上不会睡不好的
If he did not, he will not be able to sleep at night.

505
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,400
# 我的悲伤痛苦 你的沉默不语 #

506
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:30,580

他把你当狗使唤

561
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,670
你最好跟长官说实话

什么?

705
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,870
你在胡说什么?
What nonsense are you talking?

706
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,000
我说的是真的 他死了
I'm telling the truth, he is dead.

707
01:04:57,370 --> 01:04:58,920
昨天在游乐园

708
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,010
被人一枪爆头了
Being a shot to the head.

709
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,170
他去那里做什么?
But what was he doing there?

710
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,740
沙希 仔细听我说

711
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,280
不要一天打十次电话

712
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,160
照我说的做 你明天就会拿到钱
I told right, you will get the money tomorrow.

713
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:35,190
明天早上八点 在游乐园等我
Just be at the funfair tomorrow at 8.

714
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,000
你是律师吗? 每次都问东问西的!
Are you a lawyer? Everytime you like to ask questions!

715
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:41,300
你昨天真的遇到他了吗? 
Really you met him last night? 

716
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:43,130
我还以为你在开玩笑
I was thinking you were just kidding.

717
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,210
他在干一场大票
He is playing a big game.

718
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:50,760
沙希从阿尔曼·卡普尔那里拿了二百万卢比
Shashi took Rs 20 lakh from Armaan kapoor.

719
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:52,600
你看没看到沙希有绿色的包?
Did you see any green colour beg with Shashi?

720
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:16,340
我不想回去 塔姆尔
I don't want to go, Temoor.

721
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:20,500
对不起 马里卡 大姐让你回去
Sorry Malika, madam is calling you back.

722
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:28,720
- 沙希已经把我赎出来了 - 跟我们走
- Shashi has paid for my freedom. - Let's go.

723
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:18,140
沙希 大哥

724
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,150
进来吧 长官 她失血过多
Come in, sir. She is badly bleeding.

725
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,990
沙希为什么不把她送到医院?
Shahsi. Why you don't take her to hospital?

726
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:27,570
医生来了也没用
No hospital doctor did something in here.

727
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:34,800
你如果把这件事情告诉别人 你就惹麻烦了 
You will be in trouble if you tell anybody about this, 

728
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,540
懂不懂?

729
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:40,290
至少沙希死前帮过我的忙
At last before dying, Shashi has done a favour for me.

730
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:45,460
因为是现金 所以我们要报给所得税部门
We had to report to the income tax department as it was cash money.

731
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:48,550
你们要付偿还额
You have to apply for the refund.

732
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:53,130
阿尔曼是怎么认识沙希的?
How did Armaan know shashi?

733
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:56,520
现在我还无法回答你
At this moment, I do not have any answers for you question.

734
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,060
为什么敲诈阿尔曼?
Why was blackmailing Armaan?

735
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:02,270
索尼娅 他跟你说了他不知道

Inspecting it is possiable.

737
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:09,640
阿尔曼通过沙希买女孩子
Armaan was buying girls through shashi.

738
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:11,700
索尼娅 别说了
Sonia, please.

739
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:13,490
我想知道事实
I want to know the truth.

740
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:23,420
我不确定 但是有可能
I'm not that sure, but yes, it can be possiable.

741

753

我们不知道孩子们会那样

苏里不要责怪你自己

不要那样
Don't think in such way.

# 不知怎样 #

842
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:24,310

01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:31,120
# 苦苦追寻 #

845
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:36,360
# 苦苦挣扎 苦苦追寻 #

846
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:41,060
# 我在你的方向 #

847
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:45,070
# 我是谜题 #

848
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:47,660
# 我是传说 #

849
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:51,680
# 不曾结束 #

850
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:59,110
# 走近观察 你便会知晓 #

851
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:04,750
# 走近观察 你便会知晓 #

852
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:08,220
# 距离依旧 命中注定 #

853
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:13,770
# 我心已倦 不愿与你分开 #

854
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:19,530
# 我心已倦 不愿与你分开 #

855
01:17:55,710 --> 01:18:01,370
# 不曾解开的谜题 #

856
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:05,380
# 你是不解之谜 #

857
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:12,580
# 无人知晓这个秘密 #

858
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:18,120
# 无人知晓这个秘密 #

859
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:22,730
# 你究竟与何人为友 #

860
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:29,370
# 微笑着从大千世界中隐退 #

861
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:34,140
# 日日夜夜 不曾安眠 #

862
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:40,710
# 闭上双眼 已有多时 #

863
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:46,020
# 闭上双眼 已有多时 #

864
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:49,730
# 内心平静 已有多时 #

865
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,490
# 我心已倦 不愿与你分开 #

866
01:18:55,570 --> 01:19:01,170
# 我心已倦 不愿与你分开 #

867
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:24,230
你从不回家 长官
Don't you ever go home, sir.

868
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:28,880
你晚上也从未睡着
And you cant even sleep at night.

869
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:30,590
为什么?
Why?

870
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:32,350
我想问你点事
I wanted to ask you something.

871
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,490
如果没时间 我等会再来
If no time, I'll come back later.

872
01:19:50,110 --> 01:19:51,750
看他们怎么盯着我了么
See how there are staring at me.

873
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:56,990
他们一定在想 你今天和我一起
They must be thinking, today you are being with me.

874
01:19:57,790 --> 01:19:59,510
有什么区别?
What's the differance?

875
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:02,280
走吧 我带你去个地方
Lets go. I will take you to such a place.

876
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:04,630
没有人能看到我们
where no body can see us.

877
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,410
这是哪里?
Where are we?

878
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:35,740
这是我的地盘
This is my place.

879
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:39,130
没有人来过这里
Nobody comes here,

880
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,860
如果你想找我
if you cant find me anyway.

881
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,080
在这里就能找到我
You will find me here.

882
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,520
这里多安宁 是吧?
How peaceful is here right?

883
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:13,030
为什么如此难过?
Why are you so sad?

884
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:15,700
谁说我难过了?
Who said that im sad?

885
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,660
不想说的话 就不用说

886
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:22,670
我们谈点别的吧
Let's talk something else.

887
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,640
你的案子调查的如何?
Whats happening with your case investigation?

888
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,800
我听说沙希死了
I heard Shashi dead.

889
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:37,480
我不知道我在找什么
I don't know what Im seaching for.

890
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:41,890
我走的每条路 只会让我更加迷失
Each road that I take, only makes me get more lost.

891
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:47,810
感觉前方的答案都是正确的
Feels like all the answers are right in front of me,

892
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:51,150
但是我还是不能解决问题
but I still cant solve it.

893
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,120
能问你个问题吗?
Can I ask you a question?

894
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:02,460
问吧
Ask me.

895
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:08,300
沙希把你介绍给哪些有钱人了吗?
Did Shashi introduced you with any rich guy?

896
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,090
你是指阿尔曼·卡普尔
You meant Armaan Kapoor.

897
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,590
为什么不直接点的问我 长官?
Why don't you ask me straight away sir?

898
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,800
我不会感到被冒犯的
I won't get offended.

899
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:22,840
这是我的工作
This is my job.

900
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,730
我从未和他出去过
I have never gone out with him.

901
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,700
但是他的一个朋友是我的顾客
But one of his friend was my customer,

902
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:35,410
有一次阿尔曼·卡普尔和他一起来了
and there was once Armaan Kapoor come with him.

903
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,800
为什么没有告诉我这个?
Why you did not tell me this?

904
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:41,630
你没有问过
You never ask.

905
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:43,750
什么时候遇到他的?
When did you meet him?

906
01:22:44,170 --> 01:22:45,660
三年前
3 years back.

907
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:48,300
那时他还不出名
At that time he was not famous.

908
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:53,890
尼卡尔还带来另一个朋友
Nikhal also brought one of his other friend.

909
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:56,510
还有一个人
There was another man with him.

910
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,850
我们一起兜风
We went for a drive.

911
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:04,020
就这样
That's all.

912
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:07,520
第三个人
The third man.

913
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:11,320
是叫桑杰·基格里沃吗?
Was his name Sanjay Gigriwal?

914
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:14,070
我不知道他叫什么
I do not know his name.

915
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:16,960
但是我要是再见到他 肯定能认出他来
But once I look at him, I will be able to identify.

916
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:44,150
为什么你要过这样的生活 洛奇?
Why are you in this kind of life, Rozy?

917
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:48,110
那个地方不适合你
This place does not suit you.

918
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,530
我在等你
I was waiting for you.

919
01:23:53,490 --> 01:23:54,900
你会来吗?
Will you come here?

920
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:57,410
带我离开
And take me away from here.

921
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,200
如果你想离开的话 告诉我一声就好
If you want to be out, just tell me.

922
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:04,750
我会立刻带你离开
I will right away take you out now.

923
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:09,390
我知道 但是现在不行
I know that, but not this fast.

924
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:12,130
我的债务尚未还清
I still have some debts to pay.

925
01:24:14,430 --> 01:24:15,180
容我先把债还了吧?
Can I clear it first?

926
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:21,560
还用问吗 长官
What else, sir.

927
01:24:22,770 --> 01:24:25,110
也许以后 我能帮上你的忙
Maybe one day, I can be help for you.

928
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,160
我对此深信不疑 长官
I have to believe this, sir.

929
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:43,880
你和其他人截然不同
You are not same like the other guys.

930
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:45,880
据我判断
From my judgment,

931
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:47,930
你的归宿应在别处
your place belongs some where else.

932
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:50,550
是吗?
Really?

933
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:56,260
你关心他人
You know, you care for others.

934
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:58,770
也不会趁人之危
And don't even take advantage of others,

935
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:01,580
现如今这种人已经不多了
and you can't find this kind of people nowadays.

936
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,570
三年前我的一位朋友
Three years back, one of my friend

937
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:09,180
和嫖客一起离开后
went out with some guys,

938
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:12,610
便再也杳无音讯
and she did not return.

939
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:15,780
没人知道她现在身在何方
Nobody knows where she is,

940
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:18,660
在世与否
whether is she still alive or dead.

941
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:21,590
根本没人会关心
No one cares.

942
01:25:23,630 --> 01:25:25,420
很值得深思 对吗 长官?
Something to think about. Right, sir?

943
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:32,180
一个女孩失踪了 却无人问津
A girl goes missing any no one even bother asking.

944
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,970
你报案了吗?
Did you do a police report?

945
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:43,350
你在说什么 先生?
What are you talking, sir?

946
01:25:44,230 --> 01:25:47,160
看样子我得给你普及一下法律知识
Looks like I have to teach you the law.

947
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,910
卖淫是违法的
Being a prostitute is against the law.

948
01:25:53,370 --> 01:25:55,990
像我们这样的人不计其数 长官
You can't even count people like us, sir.

949
01:25:57,450 --> 01:25:59,560
世间从未有过她们存在的痕迹
When they don't event appear for others,

950
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:01,540
又怎么会人间蒸发呢?
how can they go missing?

951
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:20,020
你好 我是西卡瓦特警长
Greetings, I'm inspector Shekawat.

952
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:22,100
我来拜访尼卡尔·德西潘迪
I'm here to meet Nikhal Deshpandy.

953
01:26:25,270 --> 01:26:27,190
他想来拜访尼卡尔
He wants to meet Nikhal.

954
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:35,080
尼卡尔 有人来拜访你了
Nikhal, see. You have a guest.

955
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:48,010
医生说 他现在的理解能力有所欠缺
Doctor said he can't really understand much now.

956
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:51,440
他清楚得很 我知道!
He understands. I know it!

957
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:06,240
事故发生之后 他就失语了
After the accident, he never speak.

958
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:11,680
数据表明 利润增长了百分之八
The profit recorded went by eight percent, 

959
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:15,930
这个趋势表明这个部分有稳定增长
and this trend indicates that there's a substantial growth in this sector, 

960
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:18,160
根据...
and according to...

961
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:22,000
你好 请稍等
Hello, hold on please.

962
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,470
伙计们 我去处理一些急事... 请继续
Guys, I have some difficulties, so... Please continue.

963
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:31,070
好的 正如我所说 根据...
Ok, as I'm saying, according to the...

964
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:32,260
我要和你见面
I want to meet you.

965
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:34,520
准备好现金了吗?
Have you arrange the cash?

966
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:36,090
你拿我的话当耳旁风吗?
Didn't you hear what I was telling you?

967
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:37,310
我要当面见你!
I want to meet you!

968
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,030
嘿 你以为我是傻子吗?
Hey, do you think I'm stupid?

969
01:27:39,770 --> 01:27:42,030
你以为你对沙希所做的事情 我一无所知吗?
You think I don't know what you did to Shahsi?

970
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,030
我没有杀他!
I did not kill him!

971
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,570
事实上 我当时就拿着包 在那里等他
In fact, I was there with the bag waiting for him.

972
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:49,210
这么多年来 我从未断了他的财路
For all this years, I have been giving him money,

973
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:50,370
为何现在才动手?
and now why must I kill him?

974
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:54,330
我随时都能取你的小命 明白吗?
I can kill you whenever I want, do you understand?

975
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:57,170
这么做 对你有什么好处呢?
But what is the benefit?

976
01:27:58,670 --> 01:27:59,960
好好想想吧
Think again.

977
01:28:00,130 --> 01:28:02,810
我愿意带着钱来跟你见面
I'm willing to meet you with the money.

978
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:05,300
时间和地点由你决定
The place and time you decide.

979
01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:15,770
怎么把灯关了?
Why is the lights off?

980
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:19,230
进来吧 达夫拉 进来
Come in, Devraj. Come in.

981
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:25,500
罗西尼
Roshini.

982
01:28:30,370 --> 01:28:31,490
我不知道她在哪里
I don't know where is she.

983
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:32,990
要喝点什么吗?
Would you like to have a drink?

984
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,290
好的
Ok, sure.

985
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,160
威士忌可以吗
Whisky,OK?
986
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:42,600
加苏打水还是水
With soda water or water?

987
01:28:42,930 --> 01:28:43,970
加水
water.

988
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:45,600
加冰吗
Add ice?

989
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,120
好的
OK.

990
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:52,560
抱歉 达夫拉
Sorry, Devraj.

991
01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:54,770
我想她忘记 你要过来吃晚饭了
I think she forgot that you are coming for dinner.

992
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:58,130
她和朋友去看电影了
She has gone to watch a movie with her friend.

993
01:28:58,140 --> 01:28:59,150
没关系 长官
It's ok, sir.

994
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:05,240
喂 苏里 你好吗?
Hello Suri, how are you?

995
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:07,190
抱歉 米拉 打扰你看电影了
Sorry, Meera. I'm disturbing your movie.

996
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,940
我想让罗西尼接电话
Accually I want to talk to Roshini.

997
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:10,070
她的电话打不通
I can't get throug her mobile.

998
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:12,170
什么电影?
Which movie?

999
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:14,510
罗西尼没有和我在一起
Roshini is not with me.

1000
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:17,960
没事吧?
Is everything ok?

1001
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:20,820
没事 没事 抱歉 她可能去了别的地方
Yes, yes, ok. I'm sorry she went somewhere else.

1002
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:23,940
我弄错了 对不起
I made a mistake, sorry.

1003
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:15,060
达夫拉
Devraj.

1004
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:16,210
你知道比鲁·莫里在哪里吗?
Do you know where Bilu Morri stays?

1005
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:19,510
第二街区的一楼
At Block 2, Ground floor.

1006
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:21,340
怎么了 长官?
What happened, sir?

1007
01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:31,870
罗西尼在哪里?
Where is Roshini?

1008
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:33,600
她在里面 请稍等一下
She is inside, please wait.

1009
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,890
长官 你不能进去
She is inside, please wait.

1010
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:47,980
我早就让你滚的远远的 对吧?
I told you right to stay away, did I?

1011
01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:52,190
你疯了吗?
Are you crazy?

1012
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,280
你在这里干什么?
What are you doing here?

1013
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,780
卡伦已经死了 无法跟你进行交流
Karen has died and he can't talk to you anymore.

1014
01:30:56,990 --> 01:30:59,320
我了解你的愤怒 你痛不欲生
I understand you anger. you have pain in your heart.

1015
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:01,330
你最好闭嘴
You better be quit.

1016
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:03,490
如果你真的能和卡伦交谈
If you really can talk to Karen,

1017
01:31:03,790 --> 01:31:06,290
那就告诉他 我要见他 他在哪里?
then call him I want to see him. Where is he?

1018
01:31:06,710 --> 01:31:07,870
我做不到
I can't do that.

1019
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:10,620
只有还在世间徘徊的灵魂
Only those souls which are around in this world

1020
01:31:10,630 --> 01:31:12,790
才能现出人形
can transform into human.

1021
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:16,260
但是卡伦已经去了另一个世界
But Karen had no problem to travel from this world to theirs.

1022
01:31:16,630 --> 01:31:17,930
他走得很安详
He went peacefully.

1023
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:20,510
是的 他走得很安详
Yeah, right. He went peacefully.

1024
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:22,760
他八岁就溺水而死
He died drowning in the age of 8 years old.

1025
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:24,850
怎么可能走得安详?
How can that be peacefull?

1026
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,360
这个世间无法解释的事情很多
In this world there are alots kind of situation that can't be explain.

1027
01:31:28,770 --> 01:31:31,230
我并未选择这种宿命
I did not choose this life.

1028
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:33,150
一切都是上天注定
This life choose me.

1029
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:35,740
过来 我们走吧!
Come, lets go!

1030
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,700
听我说 苏里
Listen to me, Suri.

1031
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:40,410
首先你要排解痛苦 否则你就会备受折磨
Resolve you pain first, if not you will suffer.

1032
01:31:40,990 --> 01:31:43,330
我丈夫去世时 我痛不欲生
When my husband died I went through a lot of pain

1033
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:47,170
那也是我第一次开始和魂灵对话
and then for the first time the souls started talking to me.

1034
01:31:47,330 --> 01:31:48,280
走吧
Let's go.

1035
01:31:48,290 --> 01:31:51,250
魂灵会被你我这样深处痛苦中的人们所吸引
Those souls will get attracted to people like us who are in pain

1036
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:53,760
他们会觉得我们是同类
and they feels like we are also like them.

1037
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:55,670
放开我
Let me go.

1038
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:03,350
你居然跟我撒谎? 你隐瞒了事实
You lied to me? You hide the truth.

1039
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:05,640
我要怎么告诉你事实! 你连家都不回!
How can I tell you the truth! Are you even at home!

1040
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:07,610
不要转移话题 罗西尼
Don't change the topic Roshini.

1041
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:10,060
你居然相信这些虚无缥缈的东西
You really believe in this kind of things.

1042
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,070
你是受过教育的人
You are such an educated person,

1043
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:13,400
以前还是科学老师
used to teach science.

1044
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:15,530
好好想想 罗西尼 动动脑子
Just think, Roshini, use you brain.

1045
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:17,710
你怎么能对这些胡言乱语深信不疑呢?
How could you believe in all this kind of nonsense?

1046
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:20,780
我不知道还有谁能相信
I do not know who to believe,

1047
01:32:21,030 --> 01:32:22,380
但是我知道 她能告诉我
but I just know that she told me 

1048
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:24,330
一些只有卡伦知晓的事情
such things that only Karen knew it.

1049
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:27,120
我乐在其中
I'm happy doing this.

1050
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,080
你怎么就不能理解呢?
Why don't you understand?

1051
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,160
卡伦很想和你交谈!
Karen wants to talk to you!

1052
01:32:33,170 --> 01:32:34,460
你疯了
You have become crazy.

1053
01:32:34,590 --> 01:32:36,040
你需要治疗
You need treatment.

1054
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:38,220
我不需要治疗 只想跟你好好谈谈
I do not need any treatment but need to talk to you.

1055
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:40,300
你能跟我交心吗?
Can you talk to me?

1056
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,810
哪怕就陪我一个晚上?
Can you once stay one night with me?

1057
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:46,280
我们能像夫妻一般亲密无间
Can we once stay like married couple

1058
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:48,480
而不是像陌生人一般吗?
then being like strangers?

1059
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,560
我先告辞了 长官
I see you later, sir.

1060
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:51,980
听着
Listen.

1061
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,900
你和他一起工作 对吗?
You work with him, right?

1062
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:58,660
你也总是整晚不回家吗?
You also stay whole night out from your family?

1063
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,780
你的妻子乐意你这么做吗?
Is your wife happy with this?

1064
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:06,330
苏里 你要去哪里?
Where do you go Suri?

1065
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:07,950
我又何曾问过你一句?
Have I ever ask you before?

1066
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:11,940
晚上你都和谁在一起?
Who are you with at nights?

1067
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:14,900
我知道你根本没有在工作
I know you are not doing your work.

1068
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:17,570
我知道你跟人有约
I know you are meeting someone else.

1069
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:24,700
但是不论你身在何方 在做什么
But where ever you go ,what ever you do,

1070
01:33:24,710 --> 01:33:28,290
你都乐在其中
you spent your time and feel happy with it.

1071
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:31,310
为什么我就不能做点喜欢的事情 
Then why I can't do something 

1072
01:33:31,310 --> 01:33:32,600
来聊以自娱呢?
that I'm happy with?

1073
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:43,270
回头见 长官
I see you later, sir.

1074
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:08,380
夫妻之间吵架再正常不过了
It's commen for husband and wife to have argue.

1075
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:12,380
你和苏里近来经历太多
You and Suri has gone throught so much recently.

1076
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,100
多给彼此一点时间
Give some time.

1077
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:15,760
一切都会好起来的
Everything will be fine.

1078
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:18,140
我想不会
I don't think so.

1079
01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:27,940
你们为什么不再要一个孩子呢?
Why don't you try to have another child?

1080
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:32,280
苏里不想要
Suri don't want it.

1081
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:35,240
我以前跟他提过
I did talk to him once.

1082
01:34:35,990 --> 01:34:37,160
他连听都不想听
He doesn't want to even listen.

1083
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:47,500
我觉得他有外遇了
I think he is having affair.

1084
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:49,710
什么?
What?

1085
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:54,050
不 不可能
No, it's impossible.

1086
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:58,220
罗西尼 我们说的是苏里吗?
Roshini, we are talking about Suri here?

1087
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,930
我就此事询问过他
I did ask him.

1088
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:02,780
他并未否认
and he did not even deny it.

1089
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:28,880
你怎么会过来?
How come you are here?

1090
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,300
我想见你
I wanted to meet you.

1091
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:43,890
你爱上我了吗 长官?
Have you fallen in love with me, sir?

1092
01:35:57,370 --> 01:35:58,920
开玩笑的
I was just kidding.

1093
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,410
你有事要问我吗?
So what, would you like to ask me now?

1094
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:14,930
长官 你没事吧?
Sir, are you ok?

1095
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:27,190
我精疲力尽
I’m very tired.

1096
01:36:37,910 --> 01:36:39,330
跟我来
Come with me.

1097
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:45,500
走吧
Let's go.

1098
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,770
请不要多想
Please don't think wrong about me.

1099
01:37:41,470 --> 01:37:43,140
我只想找个人说说话
I just need a company to talk.

1100
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:48,610
如果有人这么跟我说话
If anyone talks to me like this,

1101
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:50,790
我肯定会多想的

1102
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,490
到这来
Come here.

1103
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:03,170
我又不会吃了你
I will not bite you.

1104
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,610
她是我的妻子 罗西尼
She is my wife.Roshini

1105
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:35,030
他是卡伦

1107
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:41,700
你的妻子很漂亮
You wife is beautiful.

1108
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:45,830
我和罗西尼过去一直很开心

卡伦

能否有人无忧无虑呢?
Is everyone completely happy?

1112
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:20,830
你快乐吗?
Are you happy?

1113
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:24,580
偶尔吧
Had some moments.

1114
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:35,800
你可以把过往种种视作云烟

1115
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:38,720
然后开始新的生活
and start a new life.

1116
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,930
没这么简单的 长官
It's not that easy, sir.

1117
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:45,230
为什么?
Why?

1118
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:53,080
跟你说了 你也不相信
If I tell you, you will not believe me.

1119

说说看

01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:07,040
能帮我个忙吗 长官?
Can you do something for me, sir?

1122
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,010
什么忙?

沙希的女朋友

她过得很不好

1126

为什么? 她怎么了?
