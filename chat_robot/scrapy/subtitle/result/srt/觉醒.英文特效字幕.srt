00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss Cathcart,you shouldn't do that.

00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How dare you come here under false pretences?

00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Is your soldier boy even dead?

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this grotesque charade won't bring him back.

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Neither will your blood capsules which you slipped from your cup

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and your handkerchief as we started.

45
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nor your free hand pulling the wick from this woman's candle.

46
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As if the dead had something against naked flames.

47
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're charlatans.

48
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And poor ones at that.

49
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get them out of here, Evans.

50
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get off! You bastard.

51
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I've got your brooch. - Oh, thank you, Evans.

52
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss Cathcart, when you do these things

53
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you've taken to ordering me around a little.

54
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just think with you being...

55
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What, you don't want your colleagues seeing you bossed by a civilian woman?

56
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Uh, I mean, if anyone was going to order me around, it'd be...

57
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, if Mrs Evans wasn't Mrs Evans...

58
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But she is.

59
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And she's very lucky, she is.

60
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't bully you any more. Promise.

61
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've never had a child, have you?

62
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, of course you haven't.

63
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Allow me, miss. - Thank you, Katie.

64
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's all right.

65
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, for heaven's sake. Um...

66
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who shall I make it out to? - I'm sorry?

67
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Please, Mr... - Mallory.

68
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Mallory, you'll excuse my brevity,but this is my home.

69
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Very glad you enjoyed the book. - I didn't.

70
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Excuse me? - I didn't much like your book.

71
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found it too certain.

72
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Perhaps that's only fitting for someone so rude to strangers.

73
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm a history master at a boy's prep school.

74
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Forgive my daughter, Mr Mallory.

75
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's not taking on any more work.She's quite exhausted.

76
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:42,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um, let him speak, Harry. Please.

77
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Um, I'm afraid Harry's right. I'm really not taking on any more work.

78
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you are a ghost hunter as well as an author?

79
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, you can't hunt what doesn't exist.

80
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ah, well, that's just it.

81
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We think we have one that does.

82
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to change.

83
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Katie, will you show Mr Mallory to my study.

84
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes, miss. - I'll be fine.

85
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're fine?

86
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mmm.

87
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We always know why you throw yourself into this.

88
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we don't blame you for thinking that it will help.

89
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But every time now, all we can see is the pain it causes you.

90
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

91
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. I'm sorry I keep doing this to you.

92
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not fair.

93
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"May your skin be flayed from your body"

94
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"in the hell you so arrogantly claim does not exist."

95
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An elderly woman in Dorset, I seem to remember.

96
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our school matron is a devotee of your book

97
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and has told the headmaster about the work you do.

98
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She assures him you're quite respected

99
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and your book sits alongside the Bible on many bookshelves.

100
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss Cathcart, rumour is a dangerous thing.

101
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Conversations in this room are confidential, Mr Mallory.

102
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Especially if I don't take the case.

103
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Our school is called Rookford in Cumbria.

104
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some years ago, a child was said to have been murdered there.

105
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not a pupil. It was a private house then.

106
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, who? Did they catch the killer?

107
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:21,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no record. It was an important family. All hushed up.

108
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still, it's perfectly possible someone died there.

109
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you're here about a death that may or may not have happened

110
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}however many years ago?

111
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

112
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm here about another death.

113
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A pupil. Three weeks ago.

114
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His name was Walter. Walter Portman.

115
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The day before he died, Walter went to see the headmaster,

116
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}quaking with fear, convinced he'd seen a ghost.

117
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The ghost of the murdered child.

118
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, how did he know what the murdered child looked like?

119
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was taken 18 years ago.

120
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Mallory, this is... This is an old school prank.

121
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As the camera sweeps across to expose the plate...

122
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of the boys runs behind the row to appear at both sides.

123
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was still moving when it reached him.

124
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know. That was 1902.

125
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This was '03.

126
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}'04.

127
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}1905.

128
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And, lastly, '06.

129
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the boys in the school are accounted for.

130
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All of them. In all the photographs.

131
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Including this one, taken just one month ago.

132
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss Cathcart, I can understand a child running the length of the line

133
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}in the 15 seconds it takes for the camera to make its sweep.

134
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What I can't explain is how he could get there.

135
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Millford woman.

136
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Either a batch of partially exposed photographic plates

137
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}or the same ghost was in my mother's potting shed.

138
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's half-term in two days.

139
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We'll be lucky to get any of the children back unless...

140
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not interested in the commercial fortunes of your school.

141
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There have been other sightings. The boys believe...

142
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boys believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy.

143
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure some of them even believe in God.

144
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't need me to tell you what happened

145
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to that generation of boys, Mr Mallory,

146
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and yet you don't see their ghosts stalking the halls of your school.

147
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Rookford is a boarding school, Miss Cathcart.

148
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Most of the boys are as good as orphans.

149
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't say that just because of your circumstances.

150
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then, why say it?

151
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Fear is all I remember of my childhood.

152
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I have glimpses of my parents' death

153
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"but nothing of our life in Kenya, nor coming to London.

154
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Nothing but a feeling of perpetual black terror."

155
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your tactics are despicable.

156
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Fear swallows children and the adults we become."

157
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These boys aren't worried about bumps in the night.

158
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They are frightened to death.

159
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please leave.

160
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was sent to request your help and I've done that.

161
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You strike me as a woman who won't do anything she doesn't want to.

162
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm at the Wellington Hotel. Thank you for your time.

163
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Semper veritas.

164
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Latin gives a new school an air of respectability.

165
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Means they can add a pound to the fees.

166
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I should imagine a bona fide ghost knocks it right off again.

167
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Latin puns. What fun.

168
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Always the truth."

169
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's see, shall we?

170
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't wait.

171
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're that keen that people believe in nothing?

172
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, without science people don't believe in nothing.

173
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They believe in anything, including spirits.

174
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So we need them. But you don't.

175
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe in evidence. Need has nothing to do with it.

176
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And yet you carry someone else's cigarette case.

177
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Touche.

178
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

179
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Mallory, am I...

180
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go on.

181
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Judd.

182
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey! Knees, boys!

183
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss Cathcart, this is Miss Hill, the school matron. Maud to you and me.

184
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- How do you do? - Maud?

185
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's taken this very hard.

186
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's an odd fish at the best of times.

187
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For a start, she liked your book.

188
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I feel like I know you.

189
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've read your book a dozen times at least.

190
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's on my bookshelf next to the Bible.

191
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've never met an educated lady before.

192
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not Cambridge and everything.

193
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Never mind someone famous.

194
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, the Kaiser was famous, Miss Hill.

195
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I... I just wrote a book.

196
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maud.

197
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Mallory told you to call me Maud.

198
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maud.

199
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello. - Hello.

200
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did Mr McNair not say all boys inside, Thomas?

201
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tom.

202
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone's nerves are shot to pieces.

203
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've been here 14 years. I know this place.

204
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I don't hold with any ghostly nonsense.

205
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just wanted you to know

206
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm at your service.

207
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello.

208
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it. Go on.

209
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Howell, stick up for yourself. And get that hair cut.

210
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All of you, downstairs.

211
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you, Maud. I'll take Miss Cathcart to the headmaster.

212
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Came with the building. It's the boys' favourite.

213
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}John the Baptist, I think. This way.

214
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's actually Judith slaying Holofernes.

215
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Story of a woman who stole into the enemy camp

216
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and seduced then beheaded their highest general.

217
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hmm. Those were the days, eh, Maud?

218
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not in, I'm out.

219
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}At least I was out. Now I'm in.

220
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must be the ghost lady. Come through.

221
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Reverend Purslow, this is Miss Florence Cathcart.

222
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}An educated woman. Well, well, well. Glad you're here.

223
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Presume you know you've a matron to thank.

224
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I believe. Glad I can be of service.

225
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Child dying before a parent. Dreadful thing.

226
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I lost three of them.

227
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I imagine you don't believe in the afterlife, Miss Cathcart.

228
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I don't.

229
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Terrible, isn't it?

230
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Mallory will give you a tour of the school.

231
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm on my way to the dining room should you wish to see it.

232
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Mallory.

233
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So I'm the guide now?

234
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's coming. He's coming.

235
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:04,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After supper there's an hour of scrubs, that's compulsory reading to you.

236
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then lights out at 8:00.

237
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,800
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll show you where Walter was found.

238
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd like to see everywhere the boys claim to have seen the ghost.

239
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And perhaps you'd ask Maud to join us?

240
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Most of the sightings were in here, including Walter's.

241
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:29,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}In fact, he was found outside here on the terrace.

242
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Many of the boys are now too frightened to come in here.

243
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Mallory.

244
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She doesn't like any superfluous sound.

245
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Ego contemno Latin." I hate Latin.

246
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That you, Mallory?

247
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Walter was found there.

248
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Broad found him just before breakfast.

249
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- And these doors were locked? - Mmm-hmm.

250
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did he have a bear or a toy animal?

251
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's in the front office, yes. - Could you?

252
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't like him.

253
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have my reasons. It would be indiscreet.

254
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are his glasses? He used to keep up the pretence.

255
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Used to have a limp, too. Kept him out of the trenches.

256
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- His mother couldn't bear to keep it. - Thank you.

257
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this was still on his bed the morning he was found?

258
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes.

259
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said there were other sightings elsewhere in the house?

260
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. Mostly in the west dormitory.

261
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maud, perhaps I could leave this to you?

262
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Why aren't you at scrubs? - My book, sir.

263
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you all right?

264
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's half-term tomorrow?

265
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boys with parents in far-flung places stay behind.

266
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apart from that, we have the place to ourselves.

267
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Was he bullied?

268
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They called him "Wheezy Walter". He was asthmatic.

269
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who were his friends?

270
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did he have any friends?

271
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Miss Cathcart, this is a good school.

272
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if you're different, the wrong kind of different...

273
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}His isn't the only mattress like this.

274
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere."

275
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"The sequel of today unsolders all

276
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"The goodliest fellowship of famous knights."

277
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Whereof this world hold record.

278
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Such a sleep they sleep, the men I loved."

279
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I think that we shall...

280
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"We shall never more, at..."

281
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"I think that we shall never more, at any future time,

282
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:59,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds."

283
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dowden!

284
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now.

285
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Matron, I presume you've brought this young lady to my classroom for a purpose

286
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}besides subjecting her to the outrageous behaviour of Mr Dowden?

287
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr McNair. Boys,

288
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you're all upset and frightened at the moment.

289
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:42,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, Miss Cathcart is here to put your fears to bed.

290
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's one of the cleverest people in England. Miss Cathcart.

291
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stand.

292
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Good evening. - Good evening.

293
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sit. Please sit.

294
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How many of you did Walter Portman talk to about this ghost?

295
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, did any of you see this ghost boy for yourselves?

296
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did, miss. I saw it.

297
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stand, boy.

298
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Would you like to come with me and describe...

299
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was horrible. It was on the upper corridor.

300
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wouldn't you rather... - His face was twisted.

301
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Blurred and sort of twisted.

302
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Like in the photographs.

303
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But he was in pain. Crying out.

304
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It was him. Please kill it, miss.

305
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, please. Kill it, miss.

306
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Silence.

307
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pocket Premo, 12 exposure pack with meniscus lens.

308
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,140

{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What would your father have thought?

359
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The night Walter died, he got up to use the latrine.

00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He wasn't wearing his spectacles.

361
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:31,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Parry here frightened him, using this to blur his face.

362
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't. I didn't do it to Walter.

363
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And last night he tried to do the same thing to me. Didn't you?

00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They said if I did it

366
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}then they'd be nice.

367
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stop snivelling. - Malcolm, please.

368
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who?

369
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Them. - Scab!

370
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Quiet! - But I didn't do it before.

371
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:02,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not to Walter. I liked Walter. We shared grots.

372
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Victor. - I didn't scare him.

373
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No one knows who did. - A boy is dead.

00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Wasn't me! - All right, it wasn't just him.

375
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was another boy last night.

376
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw him down in the stairwell.

377
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

378
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Dowden?

379
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- There wasn't another boy. - Ah-ah-ah. You're behind this.

380
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Honestly, sir. - You will name this other boy now.

381
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There wasn't another boy. Please!

382
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You will name this boy or you'll be thrashed where you stand. Mr McNair.

383
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honestly. No, there wasn't another boy, sir.

384
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, I tell you, sir. There wasn't another boy!

385
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}(Parry Please, sir, I promise, it was only me!

386
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, stop!

387
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honestly, I'm telling you the truth.

388
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}For God's sakes. You've done quite enough damage, you will not do this.

389
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you say?

390
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You use a balsam for your chest.

391
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just smelled it on you.

392
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I also found it smeared on the glass of the French doors and on the handles

393
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and on Walter's bear.

394
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were... You were there the night he died.

395
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I protest. This is...

396
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And did he protest when you found him downstairs,

397
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}ripped the bear from him and left him out in the dark?

398
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I came here to protect children from fear and you...

399
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are hell-bent on making them live in it.

400
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You can't die of fear. - No.

401
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:22,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you can die of an asthma attack brought on by it.

402
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He was alive when I left him. - Malcolm.

403
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was crying,

404
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}insisting he'd seen a ghost.

405
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought...

406
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought I'd toughen him up.

407
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not enough to be mollycoddled, Robert.

408
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}These boys must be strong.

409
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stronger than us.

410
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Malcolm, there's not a man on earth I'd rather protect.

411
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:33,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But the parents arrive shortly, and I must ask you to leave this school

412
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}at once.

413
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}? Be still, my soul

414
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}? Though dearest friends depart

415
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:32,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a chap in a trench not far from ours.

416
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:35,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He used to sing this hymn most sunsets.

417
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:41,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's odd separating the past from the present.

418
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The boys are transformed. You should be pleased.

419
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Semper veritas.

420
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mmm. - Truth comes at a price.

421
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ruined a damaged man.

422
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm not thinking about Malcolm.

423
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nor are you.

424
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:12,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw you.

425
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:16,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As soon as you proved the ghost was a fraud, something happened to you.

426
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You were suddenly... - Please, Robert.

427
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've done what was asked of me.

428
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Proved there's nothing to fear.

429
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing.

430
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You left church early.

431
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Judd.

432
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You going home?

433
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:06,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Found your ghost?

434
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:13,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Another case to write up while McNair's thrown to the dogs.

435
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}After all he's been through.

436
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I wonder whether any of us really know

437
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what he went through, Mr Judd.

438
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You shouldn't talk to me like that. - Excuse me?

439
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:35,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... - You think I don't know?

440
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Staying at home was wrong?

441
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come down here

442
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and tell me that?

443
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:47,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let me tell you something, ghost lady.

444
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the living you wanna watch out for.

445
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not the dead.

446
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:08,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There she is. Now try to forget all about it. The headmaster will.

447
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:12,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Getting to go home. Cakes and puddings.

448
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lucky beggars.

449
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:18,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still, we'll have a nice time.

450
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:20,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You always say that.

451
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:24,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Lucky beggars. You always say that.

452
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

453
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:38,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing.

454
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:13,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye. See you in a week.

455
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Check the out buildings before you go, Mr Baxter.

456
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,470
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There are gypsies on the Tarrow farm.

457
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your ma and pa overseas, Tom?

458
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They live in India.

459
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:38,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Takes three weeks to travel to India. They have tigers there.

460
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:40,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye, Matron.

461
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mary.

462
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you been?

463
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

464
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, but I've seen the lions in Africa.

465
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:54,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}One of them even attacked me.

466
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How come you're not dead?

467
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Apparently I was rescued by one of the villagers.

468
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:04,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, a tribal chieftain.

469
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did he kill the lion?

470
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was very young. I think so.

471
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The villagers took me in and looked after me until help came.

472
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They called me their "Mowa-Zee".

473
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:19,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}White doll.

474
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wonder what they'd think of me today, seeing me in such a silly state.

475
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Tom, can you leave us now? - Were your mother and father with you?

476
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Were they killed?

477
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Afraid they were.

478
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tom, Miss Cathcart and I want a grown-up conversation.

479
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:37,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like grown-up conversations.

480
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now.

481
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:44,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Goodbye, Mowa-Zee.

482
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maud, it was an accident.

483
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I lost my cigarette case.

484
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:59,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How could someone like you want to do such a thing?

485
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:00,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want to talk about it.

486
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:03,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't go. Miss, something has happened to you.

487
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:04,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't leave this house now.

488
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please stop calling me miss. It's Florence.

489
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I can't stay here.

490
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:13,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry.

491
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

492
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be gone in an hour.

493
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:50,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I fell.

494
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:19,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you're there, Robert.

495
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please don't go away.

496
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't go.

497
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You must be the ghost lady.

498
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come through.

499
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good evening.

500
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Good evening.

501
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be quiet.

502
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You'll be quiet or so helo me!

503
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Mallory, I need your help.

504
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're not going?

505
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Some of the equipment needs resetting.

506
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can I... - I don't understand.

507
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have your culprit. You're doing more?

508
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, would you... - No, thank you.

509
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't you like sherry?

510
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to keep my wits about me.

511
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:32,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think I shall ever drink alcohol.

512
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It makes you cross and sick. - Mr Judd,

513
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:37,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you're welcome to join us.

514
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:40,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Things to do, Matron.

515
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mallory.

516
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mr Mallory.

517
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Florence, what are you doing?

518
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:51,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was brought here to explain a phenomenon in this house,

519
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:54,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and whatever everyone else may believe, I have yet to do that.

520
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:58,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A collective delusion has been experienced here,

521
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:02,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}a child moving through the house as if there were no walls or floors.

522
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said that a child was murdered here.

523
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:07,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What if that was also caused by...

524
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're doing this because of a feeling?

525
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:12,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This morning, you were... - This is not a feeling!

526
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is a thesis. It's science.

527
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Tell me about the original murder. - One can't even be sure there was one.

528
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:22,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Something is causing this. - Two hours ago, you...

529
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Florence, why are you doing this? - Florence.

530
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:34,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What is it? - A differential thermometer.

531
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:38,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It means this side of the corridor has suddenly become

532
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}much colder than that side.

533
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:43,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You said this was a private house.

534
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:48,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Housemaids often had hidden cupboards

535
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,710
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}for mops and brooms and so forth.

536
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:02,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}May even be stairs to the upper levels.

537
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know this.

538
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:49,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's an old nursery rhyme.

539
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:55,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladybird, ladybird,

540
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:58,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}fly away home.

541
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,120
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your house is on fire.

542
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your children are gone.

543
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:12,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All except one.

544
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:18,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We need to work. Lock the house.

545
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Florence, you don't need... - Robert, lock the house.

546
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is nothing, it's a silly nursery rhyme.

547
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm frightened.

548
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tom.

549
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Tom. - He wants to get me.

550
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:36,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tom, nothing is going to happen to you. Nothing.

551
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise you that.

552
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now I must work. I'll be upstairs if you need me.

553
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can I sit with you? I won't talk.

554
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:29,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course.

555
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:40,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I get in trouble for talking.

556
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I don't talk much.

557
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:48,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you have any friends at school?

558
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can talk to me.

559
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have make-believe friends. Sometimes.

560
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:02,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing wrong with that. Many children do. I know I did.

561
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:05,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What was his name?

562
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:10,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not sure he had a name.

563
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Do yours have names? - You're still lonely.

564
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:16,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Aren't you?

565
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can tell.

566
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:23,970
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}With the boys at school, too,

567
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can tell.

568
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:30,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You had a real friend once.

569
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And you don't any more.

570
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:36,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Did you love him or something?

571
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, I loved him.

572
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:47,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was a very kind man, a very good man.

573
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I was...

574
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:01,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I did something very silly and very cruel.

575
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:07,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I think I was frightened of losing him, I loved him so much.

576
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He was in the war.

577
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:14,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did you do?

578
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:17,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wrote to him and told him

579
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:20,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't marry him and I didn't love him any more.

580
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:23,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What did he say?

581
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,450
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He died.

582
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:31,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not long after he got the letter.

583
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you did love him.

584
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why you want him back.

585
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you. Mowa-Zee.

586
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think there's a place on earth

587
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:08,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}people understand loneliness better than here.

588
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:29,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're torturing yourself. Is that what you're doing here?

589
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:31,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Proving again and again that he's really gone?

590
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Twisting the blade in deeper? - You tell me.

591
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,850
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why? Is it guilt?

592
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:37,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Preaching to me while you rip your leg to shreds

593
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as if that'll make you feel better for having survived!

594
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:48,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know what you're talking about.

595
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:55,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robert.

596
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:58,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm frightened.

597
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:01,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And I can't live with that.

598
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:03,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And yes, you're right, what I do comes at a price.

599
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:06,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate myself more and more, but I can't live with fear.

600
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd sooner be dead myself.

601
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:26,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Red four goes on the black five.

602
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Every card has its place.

603
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}When they're back where they should be, you win the game.

604
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And that goes there.

605
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:39,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That one there.

606
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:43,310
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Black eight can go on red nine.

607
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:46,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It takes time.

608
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why they call it "patience".

609
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:59,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's downstairs.

610
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:17,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mowa-Zee. - Tom. Tom!

611
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tom!

612
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:27,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know it's you, Tom.

613
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:30,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I won't chase you.

614
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:32,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep playing.

615
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Florence.

616
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:25,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are you doing this? You!

617
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:27,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I heard you giggle.

618
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:28,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I heard him giggle. - Florence!

619
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:31,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You took me to a man. Who was he? Who was he?

620
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:34,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There was a... There was a man! There was... There was a man!

621
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:35,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop this!

622
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:38,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's... It's all of you!

623
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:40,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're all doing this!

624
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:42,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You, you...

625
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:44,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You cruel and horrid little boy.

626
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:47,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Florence!

627
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate you.

628
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:55,380
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thomas Hill, you will come back here at once and apologise.

629
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:58,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop bossing me around. I haven't done anything wrong.

630
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:04,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't recognise you.

631
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:07,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought you were a kind, loving girl but there's...

632
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:10,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's nothing left.

633
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:17,980
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're a shell.

634
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:35,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's very troubled.

635
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to understand that.

636
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She likes you very, very much.

637
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She doesn't care about me.

638
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:04,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I may as well be dead like Walter.

639
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hate her.

640
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:38,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robert, I need your help.

641
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:45,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He had a shotgun, and he was there,

642
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:47,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and one of these will prove it.

643
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:56,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can leave an amber light on, but are you...

644
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:00,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll be fine.

645
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:15,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you could just lift them.

646
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:19,440
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's good.

647
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The dark used to bother me.

648
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:27,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Later, of course, it came to mean safety, no sniper fire, or...

649
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thank you. ...shells, but

650
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:34,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}as a lad I'd huddle into my bed,

651
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:40,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}wanting to see what was there but too frightened to open my eyes.

652
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:44,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

653
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:49,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's never darker than when we close our eyes and yet we keep them shut.

654
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:54,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is that?

655
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:59,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Thank you.

656
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:12,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The motion's not blurred, so even if he's moving

657
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:15,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}one of these will have him clearly.

658
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why do you keep your eyes closed, Florence?

659
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is he?

660
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:31,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God.

661
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:41,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

662
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:33,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're real.

663
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I am.

664
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:49,730
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why are these things here? What do they want with me?

665
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:01,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maybe they aren't here for you.

666
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:18,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tom, stay here. Do not leave this room.

667
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:20,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No! No!

668
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Open the door.

669
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:36,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Have you left this room? Something's happened to Florence.

670
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:39,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Promise me you'll stay here. - All right.

671
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:41,400
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tom!

672
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise.

673
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maud! Florence!

674
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:56,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw you.

675
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,340
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I saw you with him.

676
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The war hero.

677
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:04,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know what you...

678
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:08,510
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've seen plenty through these windows making my rounds, but never that.

679
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:14,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Women. Just lap up the sob stories, don't you?

680
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:17,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They were sent, you know. They didn't sign up.

681
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,480
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Suddenly they're heroes.

682
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How dare you!

683
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:29,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did nothing,

684
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and you think you can mock men like him?

685
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:33,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You take care of what you're saying.

686
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:38,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You did... You did nothing when men gave every...

687
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:14,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No!

688
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:42,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robert! Robert!

689
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever happened? What's happened, Florence?

690
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:47,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Florence, what is it? My darling girl! - Florence!

691
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:50,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Judd attacked me.

692
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:56,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He tried to... He tried to... I think I killed him.

693
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:58,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I think I killed him. - Maud, get a blanket.

694
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:00,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And run a bath. Now, please.

695
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where? Where's Judd?

696
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}By the trees at the end of the driveway.

697
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, go inside. Get to Maud and stay there. You hear?

698
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:17,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robert. Robert, don't tell Tom.

699
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:19,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tom?

700
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:22,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little Tom. He's frightened enough. He's the only child here.

701
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Florence, there are no children here. It's just us three!

702
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:28,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

703
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mowa-Zee.

704
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:08,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mowa-Zee.

705
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,760
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mowa-Zee.

706
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mowa-Zee.

707
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:11,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't mean to scare Walter that night.

708
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:16,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know.

709
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:21,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I believe you.

710
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can control that?

711
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:54,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sometimes I can.

712
01:23:55,610 --> 01:23:58,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I don't know why he could see me.

713
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:01,360
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one sees me.

714
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:04,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't make them.

715
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:07,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We see what we need to.

716
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:11,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He needed a friend.

717
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So did I.

718
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:17,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you were frightened. When you heard the music from that rabbit doll,

719
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}you said someone was going to get you.

720
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:22,220
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Who were you frightened of? - I can't tell you.

721
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:24,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please. Tell me, please.

722
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:26,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to see for yourself.

723
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:30,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's the only way we can be together.

724
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Again.

725
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:36,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What?

726
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Promise you won't go away again.

727
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mousie.

728
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:43,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mow-zee?

729
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at the doll's house. Look at it.

730
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:52,080
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No. - You started to remember,

731
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:53,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I know you did. - No.

732
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:54,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at it. You'll remember the rest.

733
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Look at it. - I don't want to look.

734
01:24:56,170 --> 01:24:58,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You started to remember, I know you did. Look at the house.

735
01:24:58,670 --> 01:25:01,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't want to look! Get away from me! - Look at the house.

736
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:16,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mousie.

737
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:18,320
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You started to remember! You started!

738
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:23,860
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You started to remember! I know you did!

739
01:25:24,610 --> 01:25:27,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you go on and on!

740
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:31,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't even wanna look at you! I can't live like this!

741
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:34,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look at it. You'll remember the rest.

742
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:42,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't know! You scheme and you laugh at me and plot!

743
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:46,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one is plotting. It's just that we can't care any more.

744
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:49,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You make it impossible to care. You don't speak for days.

745
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:51,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't speak to me. You won't even look at her.

746
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:56,600
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be quiet. You will be quiet, or so help me!

747
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:02,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your own child? You despise her.

748
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:05,280
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're a monster! - She's not a boy!

749
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She's bright, and she's sweet, and she's...

750
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:11,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Give me a son! Stay here! - You have one!

751
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:19,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How do you think that makes me feel watching your bastard boy

752
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:21,880
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}running around with... Your bastard boy running around with Florence!

753
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:24,210
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Leave Tom out of this!

754
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:30,720


755
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:32,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mummy! Mummy!

756
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:41,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay back, Florence. You can't help Mummy now.

757
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,030
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Move out of the way!

758
01:26:47,910 --> 01:27:01,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't help Mummy now. Move out of the way!

759
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:13,140
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need you to move out of the way.

760
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:16,020
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Please, Daddy.

761
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:19,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mousie, Mousie, run! Run!

762
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Think I don't know your little hiding places?

763
01:27:36,370 --> 01:27:39,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Know where my little mouse hides herself for hours on end?

764
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:19,000
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little Mousie.

765
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I really am sorry, Little Mousie.

766
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,770
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I will find you, darling.

767
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:49,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You have to go with Mummy now.

768
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mousie.

769
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:39,370
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mousie.

770
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:43,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little Mousie.

771
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:28,790
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You never said school.

772
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:37,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}From the moment you arrived, you called this place a house.

773
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:41,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You, nanny.

774
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tom's mother.

775
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:47,270
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I thought bringing you here would be enough.

776
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:50,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you didn't remember me, let alone the terrible things.

777
01:30:51,230 --> 01:30:54,110
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I knew your little mind had blacked it all out.

778
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:56,570
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But one thing kept me certain.

779
01:30:57,570 --> 01:30:59,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You saw him.

780
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:02,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You saw my...

781
01:31:03,490 --> 01:31:04,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My

782
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}darling

783
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:10,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}murdered child,

784
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:16,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}who's lived here all these years with friends he could never have.

785
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I was his friend.

786
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:24,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We shared everything.

787
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:26,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A father,

788
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:28,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}everything.

789
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:30,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you needed to see.

790
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why I sent Tom to frighten you those times.

791
01:31:37,570 --> 01:31:39,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To make you stay.

792
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I know what's best for you.

793
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:43,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always did.

794
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:46,830
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because I raised you.

795
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:49,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I wet-nursed you.

796
01:31:50,290 --> 01:31:52,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I watched you

797
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}taken away,

798
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:57,960
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}adopted.

799
01:31:58,970 --> 01:32:03,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were ripped from me like my boy had been.

800
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:09,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I never asked anything of the world.

801
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:13,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's a perfect hell on earth

802
01:32:16,730 --> 01:32:19,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}to give a woman children to love

803
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:22,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and to rob her of them.

804
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:45,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Little Tom.

805
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:15,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd forgotten everything.

806
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:21,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, perhaps not everything.

807
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:24,720
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Eaten by lions."

808
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:29,810
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, all memories are a hoax of some sort.

809
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:33,390
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You can't blame anyone for letting you believe that one.

810
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:35,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mmm.

811
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:42,530
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You needn't worry.

812
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:46,740
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one will find Judd's body.

813
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:52,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've buried better men than him.

814
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:58,250
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You see your own ghosts, too?

815
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:10,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are they with us now?

816
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:21,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your friends.

817
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They look like my friends.

818
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:30,950
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They don't have the right.

819
01:34:31,410 --> 01:34:34,580
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No amount of guilt deserves the pain you inflict on yourself.

820
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:37,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They died. I lived. - No, you didn't.

01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:40,130
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A life haunted

822
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:43,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}isn't a life at all.

823
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:46,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We may as well

824
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,550
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}be ghosts ourselves.

825
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:59,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Light a fire, get some glasses.

826
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:22,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Someone once told me it makes one cross and sick.

827
01:35:39,730 --> 01:35:42,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tom, what... What is it? What's wrong?

828
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:44,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mother said it would be all right.

829
01:35:47,490 --> 01:35:49,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She said that you would want us to.

830
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:53,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The loneliest boys are starting to see Tom now,

831
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:56,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}but will he listen to me? Will he hide? He needs you.

832
01:35:59,290 --> 01:36:01,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maud, I'm going home.

833
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:03,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Imagine what a fright you gave me going in the lake like that

834
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}before you saw the truth.

835
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:09,090
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But it's all right now.

836
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:12,840
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because he can have you forever.

837
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:15,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everything in its place.

838
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:18,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maud

839
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:21,560
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}knows best.

840
01:36:25,270 --> 01:36:26,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robert!

841
01:36:27,190 --> 01:36:28,610
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Florence?

842
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:32,780
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Florence? - Mr Mallory!-

843
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:36,620
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Florence and I will be leaving now.

844
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:39,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tom needs his family with him.

845
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,540
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Florence? Florence?

846
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:46,590
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Robert, the medicine cabinet in Maud's room. Quickly.

847
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:49,460
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something to make me sick. Something to make me sick.

848
01:36:49,550 --> 01:36:52,630
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God! No! No!

849
01:36:56,890 --> 01:37:02,230
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tom?

850
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:09,940
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't be angry, I just miss you.

851
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All the time.

852
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:18,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}My whole life I've never been happy, not one second since you left me.

853
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:23,500
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But I can't... I can't... I can't come.

854
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,420
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know that, don't you?

855
01:37:28,210 --> 01:37:30,260
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're the only friend I've ever had.

856
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:36,300
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But if I go with you now, my soul will never be happy, and I...

857
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,010
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can be, thanks to you.

858
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:42,640
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But you won't need me.

859
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,100
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one will need me.

860
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,690
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tom, you must be brave.

861
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:53,150
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Can you move through the house like there are no walls?

862
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,410
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No walls and no floors.

863
01:37:55,490 --> 01:37:57,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Help her, help her, help her!

864
01:37:57,830 --> 01:37:59,700
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then fly, little Tom.

865
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:03,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Fly.

866
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:24,930
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you dead?

867
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:27,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you dying?

868
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:30,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know.

869
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:32,900
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to sleep.

870
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:37,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need to close my eyes.

871
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:40,070
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll stay with you.

872
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,490
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I promise.

873
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:45,750
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Even if you can't see me.

874
01:38:48,630 --> 01:38:50,040
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can...

875
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:53,050
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can feel you now.

876
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,820
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll tell the boys it was an accident, of course.

877
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:56,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They'll be devastated. They adored her.

878
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:58,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We all did. Uh-uh-uh.

879
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:03,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can only think the Walter incident hit her harder than we thought.

880
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:06,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mind you, the Cathcart girl didn't help.

881
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:08,870
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I suspect she wasn't altogether well herself.

882
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:12,290
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, I read a study last term.

883
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:15,670
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ladies' minds often can't cope with further education.

884
01:40:30,770 --> 01:40:32,520
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I know you're there.

885
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:35,650
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's more than your headmaster does.

886
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,990
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I used to play here.

887
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:46,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hide and seek.

888
01:40:46,990 --> 01:40:48,330
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}She would...

889
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:52,170
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Maud would sit over there.

890
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:03,430
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm thinking of writing another book.

891
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:07,060
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The Interpretation of Ghosts.

892
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:10,180
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, God help us.

893
01:41:12,770 --> 01:41:14,190
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Victor, do your laces.

894
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:21,240
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello. - Hello, again.

895
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:26,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Actually, Robert, can you tell the driver to wait for me

896
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,660
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}at the end of drive?

897
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:29,160
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I like the walk.

898
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:31,200
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I always have.

899
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:33,920
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Till Saturday week.

900
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:45,680
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not seeing them...

901
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,890
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not the same as forgetting.

902
01:41:53,770 --> 01:41:55,350
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It isn't.

903
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:10,910
{\fncambria\fs22\bord1\shad1\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hello. - Hello.

904
01:42:14,910 --> 01:42:30,910
