1
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,080
该你走了  小姑娘
Your move, pumpkin.

2
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,910
我在思考
I'm thinking.

3
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,620
米奇  拿着
Mitch, grab that.

4
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,860
上去吧
Go on.

5
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,970
你不能一直思考
You can't think forever.

6
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,720
你迟早得出手
Sooner or later, you've got to make a move.

7
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,150
反正你也从不让我赢
You never let me win anyway.

8
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,620
让了就不是赢了
Well, that wouldn't be winning.

9
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,900
我爸爸以前经常这样说
That's what my daddy used to say.

10
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,340
他也经常下棋赢我
He used to beat me at chess, too.

11
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,970
他什么都比我好[双关]
Heck, he used to beat me at everything.

12
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,660
你认识这个人吗
You know this guy?

13
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,720
你爸爸很刻薄吗
Was your dad mean?

14
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:01,960
有时候吧
Sometimes.

15
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,510
你坏吗
Were you bad?

16
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,500
有时候吧
Sometimes.

17
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,730
你一直在路上漂泊吗
So you've been on the road all this time?

18
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,910
对
Yeah.

19
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,070
你没事吧  布莱恩
You okay, Brian?

20
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,080
怎么了  小姑娘
What is it, pumpkin?

21
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,830
我坏吗
Am I bad?

22
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,340
什么
What?

23
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,710
你为什么会这样想
Why would you think that?

24
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,680
我爸爸总是对我很刻薄
My dad was always mean to me.

25
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,610
你很好
Hey, you're good.

26
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,590
真的
You are.

27
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,090
我们的营地离这里半英里
We've got a camp about a half a mile from here.

28
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,150
绝对不行  马丁内斯
Hell, no, Martinez.

29
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,390
我们那边人已经够多了
We got too many mouths as it is.

30
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,570
看在老天的份上  他们带着个小孩
They got a kid for Christ's sake.

31
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,210
如果你跟我们回去
Hey, if you do come back with us,

32
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,830
就得接受两件事
there's two things you got to accept.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,140
第一  我掌权
One, I'm in charge.

34
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,510
第二  不许成为累赘
Two, no deadweight.

35
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,570
大家都得遵守
That goes for everyone.

36
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,140
要么做出贡献  要么就被赶走
Contribute or be cast out.

37
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,930
你能接受吗
Can you live with that,

38
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,460
布莱恩
Brian?

39
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,850
你  我  你妈妈  还有塔拉姨妈
You, me, your mom, and Aunt Tara,

40
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,230
我们都会没事的
we're gonna be okay.

41
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,150
因为我们是好人吗
'Cause we're good?

42
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,410
我们都是吗
All of us?

43
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,540
该你了
Your turn.

44
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,100
布莱恩
Brian?

45
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,120
该你了
It's your turn.

46
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,990
我在思考
I'm thinking.

你今天出去吗
You going out there today?

52
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,900
去找补给品
Supply run.

53
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,510
马丁内斯和杜尔根兄弟
Martinez and the Dolgen brothers.

54
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,140
我要在营地建立一个护士站
I'm gonna set up a nurses' station for the camp.

55
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,320
他们需要
They need one.

56
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,170
-抱歉  莉莉  这地方...  -别说了
- I'm sorry, Lily. This place is-- - Stop it.

57
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,980
我想为我们找到更好的地方
I wanted something better for us.

58
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,460
这个营地不错了
This camp is good.

59
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,940
我们会让这里变得更好
We'll make it better.

60
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,820
有鱼吗
How's the fishing?

61
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,690
没鱼了  池塘水质不好
There isn't any. Pond's dead.

62
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,630
就像一潭死水
As a doornail.

63
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,490
但我们还可以抓点兔子  臭鼬
We still got rabbits, skunks,

64
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,040
负鼠什么的来吃
some possum out here.

65
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,480
你还是管好你自己吧  独眼老布
You better watch your ass, One Eye Bri.

66
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,940
你确定我们走对方向了吗
You sure we're headed in the right direction?

67
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,760
照着霍华德的地图走的
If Howard's map is right.

68
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,300
真应该把他拖出来问个清楚
We should have dragged his ass out here to make sure.

69
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,240
人家老年人  哪里走得动
He's an old man. He can barely walk.

70
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,860
所以我才说拖着他走
That's why I said dragged.

71
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,980
希望这趟没白跑
Hope this is worth it.

72
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,440
也许他是那种末日生存主义者
Supposedly this guy was a survivalist type.

73
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,600
他的小屋里或许能找出有用的东西
His cabin might have stuff we can use.

74
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,420
说不定他还活着
Hell, maybe he's still alive.

75
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,330
我觉得危险
I won't keep my fingers crossed.

76
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,770
嘿  独眼龙  你在干嘛
Hey, One Eye. What you doing?

77
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,100
这是什么
The hell is this?

78
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:03,160
骗子


79
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,370
看来他是把某人给惹毛了
Somebody pissed somebody off.

80
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,520
管他呢
Who gives a shit?

81
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,330
死了就一了百了了
That guy's got nothing to worry about anymore.

82
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,500
继续走
Let's go.

83
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,080
-这个伤口很深  -没事
- It's a deep cut. - No, that's nothing, ma'am.

84
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,860
不过是玩刀子玩过头了  很快就好了
I just got cute with my knife, that's all. I'll be fine.

85
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,100
那么...
So...

86
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,450
我叫艾丽西娅
Alicia.

87
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,500
哦对  艾丽西娅
Alicia. Right.

88
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,830
你是海军陆战队的吗
You in the Marines or something?

89
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,060
我是陆军预备役
Army. In the reserves.

90
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,360
用的M4步枪对吧
An M4, huh?

91
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,100
你有意见吗
You don't approve?

92
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,660
别误会
I mean, don't get me wrong,

93
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,390
用M4步枪打近战不错
an M4 is great for close combat,

94
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,860
但作为野战武器的话
but as a field weapon?

95
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,690
尘土飞扬易卡壳  还是算了吧
With all that dirt and dust, no, thanks.

96
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,050
我不太喜欢长枪
I've never really been into big guns anyway.

97
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,030
我更喜欢史密斯威森手枪
I'm more of a Smith & Wesson gal.

98
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,770
方便又好用
Less fuss, you know?

99
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,520
你尽喜欢装逼对吧
You always this full of shit?

100
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,940
没错
Yes, I am

101
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,770
强奸犯

102
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,550
凶手

103
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,120
自杀了
Took himself out.

104
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,890
你觉得是他杀了之前那些军人吗
You think he's the one who 86'd those military guys?

105
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,960
-他的头还在  -没剩多少了
- He still has his head. - Some of it, anyway.

106
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,090
进里屋看看
Let's see what he's got inside.

107
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,980
听到了吗  里面有行尸
You hear that? There's one in there.

108
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,900
肯定被卡住了出不来
Must be stuck if it ain't coming out.

109
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,420
要进去吗
We going in?

110
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,440
你吓尿了吗  磨蹭什么
You want us to wait till you finish pissing in your pants?

111
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,750
-不  我只是  -别废话了
- No, I'm... - Cut the chatter.

112
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:07,810
进去吧
Let's go.

113
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,710
-很近了  -安静
- It's close. - Quiet.

114
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,960
-它出来了  -闭嘴
- It's out. - Shut up.

115
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,780
把它从我身上弄下来
Get it off of me!

116
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,850
把它弄下来
Get it off of me! Get it off of me!

117
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,920
快把它弄下来
Get it off of me!

118
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,460
皮特
Pete!

119
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,900
假如当时只有你一人在那个坑里
If it was just you in that pit,

120
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,200
我不会把你带进营地的
I wouldn't have brought you into the camp.

121
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,520
要不是那些和你在一起的人
If it weren't for the people you were with...

122
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,670
那个小女孩儿
the girl...

123
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,310
你感觉不太一样了
You seem different now.

124
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,370
变了
Changed.

125
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:11,940
是不是
Are you?

126
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:17,980
是的
I am.

127
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,760
那就好
Good.

128
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,240
这人有堆好东西
The guy had some good stuff.

129
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,520
罐头食品
Canned food.

130
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,080
我们有啤酒喝了
We got beer.

131
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,610
伙计  这儿发生什么了
Man, what happened here?

132
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,140
这间小屋里到底发生了什么
I mean, what the hell was going on in this cabin?

133
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,060
他养着那些行尸吗
Was he storing those biters?

134
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,890
她们是他的妻子和小孩
They were his wife and kid, man.

135
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,840
不是  它们是行尸
No, they were biters.

136
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,730
那些头又是怎么回事
What about those heads?

137
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,100
那些头的主人惹错了对象
Belonged to the guys who did the wrong thing to the wrong man.

138
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,430
我们最好还是别细想这事了
Probably best not to think too much about it.

139
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,960
你最好听独眼老布的话  皮特
Better listen to One Eye Bri, Pete.

140
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,410
我永远也分不清他是在使眼色还是在眨眼
I can never tell if he's winking or blinking.

141
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,090
但你知道如何控制的  是吧  老布
But you know how to regulate, don't you, Bri?

142
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,980
他一直是这样吗  马丁内斯
He was always like this, Martinez?

143
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,110
是啊  喜怒不形于色
Oh, yeah. Ice in the veins.

144
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,890
你应该看看他当年风光的样子
You should have seen him back in the day.

145
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,890
你们大伙儿呢
What about you fellas, huh?

146
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,090
在这巨变发生前你是做什么的
What did you do before it all changed?

147
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,650
我是
I was...

148
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,510
我是个冰淇淋车司机
I was an ice cream truck driver.

149
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,870
之后我"升级"了下我的人生
Till I upgraded my life

150
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,800
成为了一个坦克驾驶员
and I became a tank operator

151
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,610
为美国陆军服务
for the US Army.

152
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,770
当一切变糟之后
Then when everything went tits up,

153
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,360
我离开了军队  把我的坦克一起带走了
I got the hell out and took my ride with me.

154
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,530
假如你有一辆坦克的话
End of the world don't mean shit

155
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,720
世界末日就不算什么屁事了
when you got a tank.

156
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,710
我也是陆军
I was Army, too.

157
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,060
驻扎在本宁堡
Stationed out of Fort Benning.

158
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,630
当这一切发生后我还在那儿待了一阵子
Stayed for a while after it all started.

159
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,370
这就是我家皮特
That's my Pete.

160
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,010
他太忠心了  不愿离开
He's too loyal to bounce.

161
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,240
你呢  布莱恩
What about you, Brian?

162
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,060
当巨变发生时你在做什么
What did you do when it all went bad?

163
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,740
生存
I survived.

164
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,980
等等  你父亲是位天主教神父吗
Wait, your father was a Catholic priest?

165
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,820
没错
That's right.

166
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,010
所以神父当了爹吗
So the father became a daddy?

167
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,440
的确给教堂带来了一些问题
It caused some problems with the Church a little bit.

168
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,640
这些故事布莱恩以前都听过
This is all stuff Brian's heard before.

169
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,980
我们在一起待过很长时间
We spent a lot of time out there together.

170
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,200
你们在这里做得很好  我是说这个营地
You've done all right here. I mean this camp.

171
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,640
这是一切发生之后我第一次有安全感
It's the first time I've felt safe since all this started.

172
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,280
我跟布莱恩之前待的地方挺不错
The place Brian and I lived before kind of worked.

173
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,660
我想让这里也一样
I guess I wanted that again.

174
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,740
听起来你们的旧营地非常好
Sounds like your old camp was pretty sweet.

175
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,300
你们有围墙  对吗
You guys had walls, right?

176
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,740
没错  那是
Yeah. Yeah, it was...

177
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,730
那是个好地方
it was a good place.

178
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,300
这里也是个好地方  对吗
This place is good, too, right?

179
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,270
你知道的
You know it.

180
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,480
希望有一天我能听听详情
I want to hear all about it someday.

181
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,000
布莱恩一个字都不肯说
Brian won't say a word.

182
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,180
过去的事就让它过去吧
I say leave the past in the past.

183
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,960
好吧  很久以来第一次
Well, for the first time in a long time,

184
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,640
-我醉成一坨屎了  -塔拉
- I'm shitfaced. - Tara.

185
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,030
抱歉  梅根  别说那个词  好吗
Sorry. Megan, don't say that, okay?

186
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,860
-你想走了吗  -好
- You want to get out of here? - Yeah.

187
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,890
谢谢款待  尤其谢谢你们的啤酒
Thanks for the dinner. Double thanks for the suds.

188
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,890
好  再见
Yeah. Boom. There you go.

189
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,030
-注意安全  -好
- Be safe. - Yep.

190
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,270
我想  我想我也该走了
I think, um-- I think I'm gonna go.

191
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,620
你确定吗  我还有不少臭啤酒呢
You sure? I got a couple of skunky beers left.

192
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,200
我没事  谢谢
I'm good, thanks.

193
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,830
布莱恩  屋顶又漏了
Brian, the roof's leaking again.

194
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,850
你去修修吧  伙计
You should fix that, man.

195
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,800
我会的
I'll do that.

196
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,930
等一会儿  小娃娃
Later, muneca.

197
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,280
差点忘了  有个惊喜给你
Almost forgot. Got a surprise for you.

198
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,880
我靠
Aw, damn it.

199
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,930
再给我递一个
Hand me another one.

200
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,510
你知道他死了  对吗
You know he's dead, right?

201
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,110
香珀特
Shumpert?

202
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,080
伍德伯里之后他就不一样了
He was never the same after Woodbury.

203
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,890
他变得很鲁莽
Yeah. He got reckless.

204
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,540
行尸在那边咬掉了他一块肉
Biter took a piece of him right over there.

205
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,580
我发誓  他都没想要躲开
I swear, he didn't try to get out of the way.

206
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,600
我亲手放倒了他
I put him down myself.

207
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,320
就在那边
Right over there.

208
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,220
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

209
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,290
有些事情你永远无法回头
There's some things you just can't come back from.

210
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,690
它们变成了你的一部分
They become a part of who you are.

211
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,390
不管你是否能够接受
Either you live with them or you don't.

212
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,820
看起来你接受的挺好
Well, you seem to be living with them pretty well.

213
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,100
你也一样
So are you.

214
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,460
那家人  他们把你带了回来
That family, they brought you back.

215
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,140
你很幸运  我不能
You're lucky. I couldn't--

216
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,670
我不能再那么做了  不能冒那个险
I couldn't do that again. Couldn't risk it.

217
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,180
想到可能失去他们  我就无法在夜里安眠
Couldn't sleep at night knowing I was gonna lose them.

218
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,480
我不会失去她们的
I'm not gonna lose them.

219
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,240
是啊
Yeah.

220
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,600
你不认为你能保护营地的安全吗
What, you don't think you can keep this place safe?

221
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,400
我会尽力
I'll try.

222
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,060
希望我们能尽量做好准备
Hopefully we'll be prepared for whatever comes.

223
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,550
现在你来了
Now you're here,

224
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,320
也许我们可以一起干
maybe we can share the crown a little.

225
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,260
天呐
Oh, Jesus.

226
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,160
早知道我就去学学高尔夫
I should have taken some golf lessons before the-

227
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,260
我不想这么做
I don't wanna do it!

228
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,520
我不想  我不想
I don't want it! I don't want it!

229
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,170
听见了吗  我也不想  该死的
You hear me? I don't want it, damn it!

230
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,580
我也不想
I don't want it.

231
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,870
我也不想
I don't want it.

232
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,880
布莱恩  我们回来了
Brian, we're home!

233
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,910
梅根  他睡觉呢
Megan, he's sleeping.

234
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,560
布莱恩
Brian?

235
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,810
你在发抖
You're shaking.

236
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,440
怎么了
What is it?

237
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,300
做了个噩梦  没什么
I just had a bad dream, that's all.

238
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,850
什么样的噩梦
What was it?

239
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,070
我不记得了
I can't remember.

240
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,390
大家听着
Listen up!

241
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,550
今天早上  我们在一个坑里
We found what was left of Martinez

242
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,760
找到了马丁内斯的残骸
in a pit this morning.

243
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,520
貌似他当时在打高尔夫
Looks like he was hitting some golf balls,

244
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,070
他喝多了
he got drunk,

245
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,460
然后掉进了坑里
he fell in.

246
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,610
那现在怎么办
So now what?

247
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,470
我将继任营地首领
I'm taking leadership of the camp.

248
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,580
-不  不  -等一下  都等等
- No. No. - Hold on now. Hold on now!

249
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,770
我们应该投票才对
We should vote on who leads, right?

250
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,530
-是啊  -你没权利就这么接任
- Yeah. - You can't just take over.

251
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,990
-闭嘴  婊子  -你说什么
- Shut your mouth, you little bitch. - What?

252
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,290
冷静
Hey, calm down!

253
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,190
大家都冷静
Calm down, all of you.

254
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,780
我们现在
We need each other

255
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,690
更需要团结一致
now more than ever.

256
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,330
能熬过这一切  所有这一切的唯一办法
The only way we get through this, through any of this,

257
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,620
就是团结一致
is together.

258
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,640
现在的安排是暂时的
Now this is temporary.

259
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,200
未来几天内我们会想办法选举
We'll find some kind of way to do a vote in the next couple of days.

260
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,520
但现在  一切照旧
For now, it's business as usual.

261
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,870
行吗
Okay?

262
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,950
你们听见他说的了
You heard the man.

263
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,030
解散
Move!

264
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,050
拜托
Please?

265
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,260
做好准备  我们去找补给
Gear up. We're going on a hunt.

266
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,800
定量配给  修护栏  药品储备
Rationing, fences, medical supplies.

267
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,710
有无数个问题而人们期望我给出答案
There are 100 questions and people are looking to me for answers.

268
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,620
当领袖是很难
Well, it's hard to lead.

269
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,910
是啊  我需要点协助
Yeah, I could use some help.

270
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,290
有多少人
How many?

271
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,650
10个
10.

272
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,910
可能不到
Maybe less.

273
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,840
但他们供给很足
They got a lot of supplies, though.

274
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,650
也许我们该把他们吸收进来
Maybe we should take 'em in.

275
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,850
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

276
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,770
我们的供给只是勉强够分
We barely got enough to go around as it is.

277
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,520
听着  皮特  我知道你不想伤害任何人
Look, Pete, I know you don't want to hurt nobody.

278
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,210
我也不想  但我们需要那些供给
Neither do I, but we need those supplies.

279
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,950
我们直接过去
Now let's just go over there

280
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,300
拿到需要的东西  就回家
and take what we need and go home.

281
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,400
绝不采取暴力
No rough stuff.

282
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,500
-你想抢劫他们  -何不呢
- You want to rob 'em? - Why not?

283
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,110
我们需要他们的补给
We need their stuff.

284
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,850
-他们有枪  但如果我们动作快点  -不
- They got guns, but if we roll up on 'em quick--  - No.

285
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,250
不行  我们自己也能找到供给
No, we can find our own supplies.

286
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,370
走吧
Come on.

287
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,510
太搞笑了
What a joke.

288
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,690
我们干得挺好的
We did all right.

289
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,780
是啊  几只该死的松鼠  几罐炼乳
Yeah, a couple of damn squirrels, some condensed milk.

290
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,040
你还要我怎么样  我在努力呢
What do you want from me? I'm trying here.

291
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,580
你去哪儿
Where you going?

292
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,810
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

293
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,700
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

294
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,320
这不是行尸干的
This wasn't biters.

295
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,460
是人干的
People did this.

296
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,090
肯定是刚发生的
Must have just happened.

297
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,050
我们本来可以拿到供给的
We would have had those supplies.

298
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,240
你在担心供给吗
You're worried about supplies?

299
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,240
这些人已经死了  米奇
These people are dead, Mitch.

300
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,700
你说得太对了  他们死了
You're damn right they're dead!

301
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,600
反正他们都是个死
That was gonna happen either way.

302
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,030
现在倒让别人抢走了咱们的供给
Now some other group's got our stuff.

303
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,350
米奇  米奇  不
Mitch. Mitch, no!

304
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,230
他可能还活着
He might have lived.

305
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,270
可能吧
Might have.

306
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,050
需要这个吗
Need this?

307
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,880
布莱恩  出什么事了
Brian, what's going on?

308
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,800
-马上收拾你的东西  -怎么啦
- Pack your things, now. - What's happening?

309
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,770
等等  宝贝
Hold on, baby.

310
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,130
拿上你的衣服  带点吃的  快点
Grab your clothes, pack some food. Come on.

311
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,630
妈妈
Mommy?

312
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,800
-布莱恩  住手  -去找塔拉
- Brian, stop. - Get Tara.

313
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,050
我们得走了  这里不再安全了
We need to leave. It isn't safe here anymore.

314
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,230
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

315
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,450
我们不能就这么走人
We can't just run off.

316
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,680
我是营地里唯一的护士  塔拉跟艾丽西娅在一起
I'm the only nurse in camp. Tara's got Alicia.

317
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,170
那梅根怎么办
What about Megan?

318
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,590
听着  这里就要出大事了
Look, things are about to go very wrong here.

319
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,780
我以前遇到过  不能再让你和梅根遭罪
It's happened to me before. I can't put you and Megan through that.

320
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,330
不能再失去你们了
Can't lose you again.

321
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,090
那皮特怎么办
What about Pete?

322
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,740
你说过他是个好人
You said he was a good man.

323
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,560
-我错了  -但是...
- Well, I was wrong. - But...

324
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,200
你相信我吗
Do you trust me?

325
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,700
你相信我吗  莉莉
Do you trust me, Lily?

326
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,800
那就快收拾东西
Then pack your things.

327
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,300
我们今晚就走
We're leaving tonight, okay?

328
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,730
快点
Come on.

329
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,970
妈妈
Mommy.

330
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,620
妈妈
Mommy.

331
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,060
我们要去哪
Where are we going?

332
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,240
-艾丽西娅  -你应该开慢点
- Alicia. - Maybe you should slow down.

333
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,490
不行  我不明白  我不懂
No, I don't understand this. I don't understand this.

334
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,340
不管去哪里我们都在一起  好吗
Hey, we're together, okay?

335
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,050
我们在营地里什么都有  有食物有住所
We have everything back there. We have food, we have shelter.

336
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,750
-布莱恩  -天呐
- Brian. - Oh, my god.

337
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,520
待在车里
Just stay in the car.

338
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,250
你在做什么
What are you doing?

339
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,400
生存
Surviving.

340
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,360
我们需要谈谈
We need to talk.

341
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,600
米奇的事情
About Mitch.

342
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,650
进来吧
Come in.

343
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,560
我就知道会这样
I knew this was coming.

344
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,430
我总是得帮他擦屁股
I've been getting him out of trouble my--

345
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,130
皮特呢
Where's Pete?

346
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,080
他死了
He's dead.

347
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,580
现在你也要把我干掉吗
You gonna kill me, too, now?

348
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:50,800
因为我杀了营地里那个老家伙吗
Huh? For the old guy at the camp?

349
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,190
抽烟吗
Smoke?

350
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,290
你对我哥哥做了什么
Why did you do my brother?

351
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,500
关于那个营地  你说得对
You were right about that camp.

352
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,710
我们应该把他们的补给抢回来
We should have taken their supplies.

353
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,810
我不在乎你杀了那个老头
I don't care that you killed the old man.

354
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,190
像你哥哥那种人  总是坚持做对的事情
Men like your brother, always doing the right thing,

355
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,600
甚至以自己人为代价
even at the cost of their own people.

356
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,160
抽根烟吧
Go on. Have a cigarette.

357
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,470
我戒了
I quit.

358
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,960
我也是
Yeah, me, too.

359
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,560
我还记得我抽的第一根烟
I remember the first smoke I ever had.

360
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,880
我和我哥挤在车库里
Me and my brother huddled in the garage

361
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,910
吸着我爸的好彩烟
puffing on one of my dad's lucky strikes.

362
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,440
他肯定是闻到了烟味  接着就冲了进来
He must have smelled the smoke, because he came barging in,

363
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,490
想揍我们
looking to beat up on us.

364
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,010
但是我哥哥挡在我前面
But my brother got between us.

365
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,370
说是他偷的
Said he stole them.

366
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,700
根本不是  是我偷的
Wasn't true. It was me.

367
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,210
但我哥哥就是那种人
But that was my brother.

368
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,680
英雄
Hero.

369
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,250
他因此被揍得鼻青脸肿  肋骨断了一根
He got two black eyes and a broken rib for that.

370
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,980
我也挨了打
And I got beat anyway.

371
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,750
拿一根吧
Take one.

372
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,280
现在我接管了
I'm running things now,

373
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,500
我会尽我所能保护这个营地
and I will do everything it takes to protect this camp.

374
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,320
如果你加入我  我保证
Now, if you join me, I promise you

375
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,180
你以后再也不用担心自己的行为
you will never have to worry about whether you were doing

376
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,440
是对还是错
the right thing or the wrong thing.

377
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,470
因为为了营地
Because we will do

378
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,070
我们会做任何事
the only thing.

379
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:28,460
皮特的事我们怎么对营地的人说
What are we gonna tell the camp about Pete?

380
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,730
我们就说他在寻找补给时
We'll tell them he died on a supply run

381
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,440
为救我们而死
saving our asses.

382
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,570
你觉得人们会相信吗
You think they're really gonna believe that?

383
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,640
人们相信自己想相信的事
People believe what they want to believe.

384
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,570
人人都爱英雄
Everybody loves a hero.

385
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,750
外围防护如何了
How's the perimeter coming?

386
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,300
挺好的  我们用车围起了整个营地
It's good. We got cars ringing almost the entire camp.

387
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,410
再去找点东西
I think a few more runs,

388
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,860
就能建起一个缓冲带了
we should have ourselves a nice little buffer.

389
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,010
尸坑呢
And the pits?

390
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,080
行尸不断来  我们不断烧
They keep coming, we keep burning them.

391
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,360
不知道是不是因为太热了
I don't know if it's the heat or what,

392
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,350
最近它们变得非常多
but there have been a hell of a lot more of them lately.

393
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,020
-弹药呢  -充足
- And the armory? - solid.

394
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,160
我收集了营地的所有子弹
I rounded up all the ammo in camp.

395
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,210
我们的子弹都堆满了
We're officially stocked in the bullet department.

396
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,090
但还是告诉你的队员
Still, tell your crews

397
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,690
以后外出搜索只准用弓箭
supply runs are arrow only from now on.

398
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,410
子弹这年头很珍贵
Gunshots are a luxury.

399
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,920
留着它们迟早用的上
Sooner or later we're gonna need 'em.

400
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,470
对  不只是对付行尸
That's right, and not just for the biters.

401
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,440
米奇  我  还有皮特
Mitch and I and Pete,

402
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,570
我们见识过外面的人有多危险
we saw what people can do out there.

403
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,440
如果碰到陌生人  就避开他们
You come across strangers, you just avoid them.

404
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,790
回来告诉我们你在哪里看到了他们  好吗
Come back here and tell us where you saw them, okay?

405
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,080
走吧
Let's go.

406
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,200
也许我们能找到更好的地方
Maybe we can find a better place.

407
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,320
你知道  如果
You know, if...

408
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,360
我们愿意去争取的话
we're willing to fight for it.

409
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,490
我们不用去找更好的地方
We don't need to find a better place.

410
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,870
这里就是家
This is home.

411
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,100
你是鬼  塔拉姨妈
You're it, Aunt Tara.

412
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,370
什么  我不能当鬼  我在放哨
What? I can't be it. I'm on guard duty.

413
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,060
我是个负责任的成年人
I have to be a responsible adult.

414
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,000
-你是鬼  -快去追她
- You're it. - Go get her.

415
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,720
-这不公平  -快跑  梅根
- No fair! - Run, Megan.

416
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,720
你不必独自承担
You don't have to do this alone.

417
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,170
抓到你了
Caught you.

418
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,570
塔拉姨妈
Aunt Tara!

419
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,270
梅根
Megan!

420
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,570
塔拉姨妈  不
Aunt Tara! No!

421
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,510
-妈妈  -梅根
- Mommy! - Megan!

422
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,310
没事了  没事了
It's okay. It's okay.

423
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,430
没事的
It's okay.
