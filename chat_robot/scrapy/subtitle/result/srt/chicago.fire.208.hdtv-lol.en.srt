I'm here to say i'm sorry.

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,510
Hop in the back.

9
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,510
With all the eyes on this house,

10
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,650
You really think it's a good idea to bring people on ridealongs?

11
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,900
What,i can't have a friend here?

12
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,040
Help me.please!

13

You've always been there for me.

16
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,390
Yeah,that'll never change.

17
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,920
I promised heather i'd have this stuff boxed up and shipped by friday.

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,690
You did a good job takingcare of those kids,matt.

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,500
I'm gonna miss coming by andhanging out with those guys.

20
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,130
You can still come by.

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,790
I may not be as good at charades,but i can be decent company.

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,760
all right,i think that's the last of it.

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,280
I'm serious.You should still come by.

24
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,600
What?

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,770
I. I just feel like we've already been downthis road,you know?

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,960
Yeah. 

27
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,670
I'll see you at work.

28
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,160
Sure.

29
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,780
Kind of unfair that i have to pay rent and she doesn't.

30
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,220
Life is unfair,otis.

31
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,380
There you go.

32
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,390
Is that a viper helmet?

33
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,530
Yeah,yeah,yeah.Yes,yes,it is.

34
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,850
You're a battlestar fan?

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,350
This the dual signature edition,both hatch and benedict?

36
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,790
Yeah,i bought it forlike 350 a few years back,

37
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,300
But it's worth way more than that now.

38
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,870
Better investment than stocks any day.

39
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,220
That's exactly what i told my mom.

40
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,660
Morning.

41
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,930

42
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,260
No

43
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,050
i put in a transfer to another house.

44
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,530
You. You put in a transfer?

45
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,330
What. What do you mean?

46
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,100
I just wanted.i want a change of scenery.

47
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,860
It's. It's getting stagnant there.

48
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,940
Okay.For how long?

49
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,670
I. I'm. I'm not coming back to 51.

50
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,250
The tech professor was telling me about some jobs inheatingAnd cooling repair that 

51
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,080
pay real good money.

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,550
Good.As soon as you get yourdegree,you can look into it.

53
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,140
Yes,boss.

54
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,230
Leon.

55
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,970
Yvette,be careful.

56
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,440
Drive that thing like a kamikaze.

57
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,850
Girl hasn't listened to us since we babysat her.

58
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,740
Yo,i'ma call you after i get out of class.

59
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,760
Go,go,go!

60
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,290

00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,270

63
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,390
Come on.Come on,baby.

64
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,920
Joe?

65
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,880
Come on!

00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,780
I got her pulse back.

71
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,880
Get her into the ambulance,get her on a monitor.

72
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,820
She's hanging on.

73
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,350
I don't need no damn doctors,man.

74
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,440
Get the hell up off me!

75
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,890
Yo,that's dom.

76
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,590
The insane kings beenafter him for a while.

77
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,550
- Get out of here.
- Why?Who's that?

78
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,390
Just go.

79
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,770
Recognized you from firehouse 51.

80
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,920

Joe cruz.

83
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,620
Did you see what happened?

84
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,150
I was around the cornerwhen the shots were fired.

85
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,070
I. Shooter's car wasgone by the time i ran up.

86
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,950
Yvette,the victim.She. 

87
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,730
I know her and her mom.

88
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,650
They're neighbors.

89
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,790
It's a terrible thing.I hope she's all right.

90
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,790
Yeah,we'll see if we can get any i.d.on the shooter from witnesses.

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,330
I remember you used to get coffee here.

96
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,530
- I was hoping to run into you.
- Okay.

97
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,460

98
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,380
Any chance you wanna join me?

99
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,760
I'm dateless.

100
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,550
I mean,i'd.I'd loveto,but i don't have a tux.

101
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,440

Okay.

104
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,120
Benny sent me christmas presents almost every years,

105
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,150
So i'll give him that.

106
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,930
Same here.Express mail.

107
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,810
So what's your real family like?

108
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,740
My mom got married when i was four,

109
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,100
and i have two stepsisters,Twins,volleyball champions of the world.

110
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,670
- Cool.
- Yeah.

111
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,940
A lot of travel,though.

112
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,240
My mom and stepdad are attheir tournaments every weekend.

113
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,800
I'm sure they're proud of you too.

114
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,860
Yeah.

115
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,470
I don't plan on.On working here forever.

116
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,710
I'm hoping to start my owncatering company someday.

117
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,220
- That's great.
- Yeah.

118
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,740
So what got you into cooking?

119
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,830
Who knows?

120
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,860
I better get back to work,though.

121
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,690
Sure.

122
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,160
It's been a really weirdthing seeing benny again

123
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,070
And finding out about a halfsibling.

124
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,980
Little weird.

125
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,710
Well,it was. It was really nice meeting you,kelly.

126
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,580
Any chance you'd want to come by the firehouse and cook for us?

127
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,920
We'd supply all the ingredients.

128
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,690
And it would be good practice for the catering gig.

129
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,630
Sure.That'd be great.

130
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,650
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

131
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,270
- 6:00?
- That's perfect.

132
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,440
- Okay.
- All right,i'll see you then.

133
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,960
And of course,you know,my mother's blaming me,

134
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,450
Saying that as her employers,

135
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,300
We should have figured out a way to keep her in the country.

136
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,730
No offense,but zoya's english was a little no bueno.

137
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,360
It might boost sales if we got a bartender

138
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,330
Who could actually communicate with the customers.

139
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,330
Zoya's leaving?

140
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,950
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

141
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,500
Back to mother russia.

142
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,650
Heard sergeant voightcalled here looking for you.

143
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,890

144
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,750
He's working a driveby went down in my neighborhood this morning.

145
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,860
I was nearby when it happened.

146
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,190
Morning,everybody.

147
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,590
I have a quick announcement to make.

148
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,890

149
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,810
Transferred as in.As in like past tense?As in not coming back?

150
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,600
Correct,and it is her prerogative.

151
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,170
Look,shay served this house well.

152
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,980
This here is alan choot.

153
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,130
He's gonna be working with us this shift.

154
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,690
Chout,actually.

155
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,610
Rhymes with shout.Great to meet you guys.

156
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,270
I am sure you will givehim a warm 51 welcome.

157
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,200
You're dawson,right?

158
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,530

Heard great things about you.

160
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,990

162
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,390
I found out at 7:15 this morning.

163
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,010

164
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,610
You reneged on a deal.

165
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,130
I changed my mind.

166
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,030
It's within my rights to do so.

167
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,160
You and i,we.We. We've had some disagreements in the past,

168
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,540
But that's to be expected.

169
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,580
And i think we played fair and were respectful of each other.

170
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:53,350
And i like my job when i'm working in a situation like that.

171
00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:00,040
But when someone crosses me or underestimates me,

172
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,890
I like it even more 

173
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,120
because it gives me an opportunity

174
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,810
To show exactly what i'm capable of.

175
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,320
Make no mistake.

176
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,380
I'm going to shut down 51.

177
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,390
And when i'm done doing that,

178
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,580
i'm gonna bury you.

179
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,010
pouch,get back here.

180
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,130
Sorry about the busybody.

181
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,870
No problem.Nice to meet you.

182
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,940

188
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,300
All right.

189
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,610
So you and the wife aremaking another go of it.

190
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,960
Yeah.

191
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,500
We went through a rough spotwhen i got back from iraq,

192
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,550
And she was with thisother guy for a while.

193
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,710
But put all that behind us,and so far,so good.

194
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,560
Glad to hear it.

195
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,260
Why is voight looking for you?

196
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,390
Don't worry.

197
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,210
He's just looking intoa shooting in my hood.

198
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,230
That's it.

199
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,690
Ambulance 61,engine 51,truck 81,squad 3.

200
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,360
Accident at broad and wacker.

201
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,200
Threecar accident with multiple victims.

202
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,030
I need two more ambulances.

203
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,340
Copy that.

204
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,280
Chief,we got the minivan.

205
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,870
Squad,check out the second car.

206
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,940
Capp!You grab the passenger.

207
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,800
Tony,clarke,you guys grab the pickup.

208
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,470
On it.

209
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,200
Casey,we got two booster seats!

210
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,700
Check for kids.

211
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,220
I'll get in to the driver.

212
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,150
51,drop two lines and charge 'em.

213
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,600
- xxxx
- I smell gas.

214
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,970
Right away,chief.

215
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,450
No kids!All clear in the back!

216
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,470

217
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,700
We're gonna get you outof here.Hang tight.

218
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,810
Dawson,could use your help in the minivan.

219
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,560
On my way.Go help squad.

220
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,260
She's pinned in pretty good.

221
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,620
- I need the small ram.
- Got it.

222
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,380
- Hang on,guys.
- I'm here.

223
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,110
we got two in the car.Both are bleeding.

224
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,580
Passenger's unconscious.

225
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,620
bud,what the hell are you doing?

226
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,910
Get your foot off the pedal.

227
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,590
Get your foot off the.

228
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,100
Capp,get over here!

229
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,720
- Get out.
- That guy caused the whole thing.

230
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,330
Was driving like a lunatic.

231
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,820
Let's get you checkedout in the ambo,come on.

232
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,400
Get something to knock him out.

233
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,540
Now,choot!

234
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,840
Let's go.

235
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,250
Chest laceration.Shortness of breath.

236
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,110
Legs pinned,but seems pretty alert.

237
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,830
Just breathe nice and easy for us,okay?

238
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,840
We're gonna take good care of you.

239
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,890
- Casey?
- Yep.

240
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,040
I'm gonna put a ccollar on you.

241
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,320
And then you'll be onyour way to the hospitalWhere you can see your family.

242
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,680
She'll be free in a sec.Almost ready?

243
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,830
Almost.

244
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,860
Back board?

245
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,390
Dawson!

246
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,690
I'm good.

247
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,480
- You okay?
- I'm good.

248
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,980
Good.

249
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,680
Get back.

250
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,280
Hit it!

251
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,230
As soon as the flames took over the car,

252
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,780
I was gonna jump in the back window myself.

253
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,860
I do a lot of spelunking,so i'm good with diving into small spaces,

254
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,610
But i wasn't wearing my fire protective gear.

255
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,970
Well,it's probably best if you.

256
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,210
Stayed outside?Yeah,that's what i figured.

257
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,590
My buddy that i go spelunking with,

258
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,620
He throws these crazyparties on the weekend,and we always.

259
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,310
Choot?No offense,but i could reallyuse some quiet right now.

260
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,610
My head's killing me.

261
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,440
It's chout,actually.

262
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,440
Lisa?I picked up some.

263
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,760
Baby.

264
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,340
What are you doing here?

265
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,900
Well,heard about the two of you gettin' back together.

266
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,050
Wanted to offer myheartfelt congratulations.

267
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,760
But lisa and i stillhave unfinished business.

268
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,600
I loaned her some moneywhen we were together.

269
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,090
You're a real piece of work,hayes.

270
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,190
I said i'd pay you back.

271
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,130
Get the hell out.

272
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,250
I know all about you.

273
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,460
Lord knows i've heard enoughabout it from this one.

274
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,850
I want my money.

275
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,710
Hayes.

276
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,810
I'm not gonna tell you again.Get out.

277
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,210
I swear to god i didn'tknow he was coming over.

278
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,490
He just showed up.

279
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,470
But i'll take care of it.Don't.

280
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,250
That didn't go well.

281
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,470
That's how he always looks.

282
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,550
Everything all right?

283
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,650
It's fine.

284
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,980
Who was that guy whowalked out right before.

285
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,010
It's none of your business,capp.Drop it.

286
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,010
Hit it.

287
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,120
Some cities have gone as far as to sue

288
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,400
To stop cutbacks inessential emergency services.

289
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,020
Miami,omaha,stamford.

290
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,480
You're thinking about a lawsuit?

291
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,740
Well,it's not a permanent solution,

292
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,440
But these closures thatmcleod is implementing,

293
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,060
They're in breach of firefighters'contract with the city.

294
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,770
We could talk to sullivan,president of the union.

295
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,080
We get him to file an injunction against firehouse closures.

296
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,170
I don't know,chief.

297
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,220
Greg sullivan is more about getting his picture taken than standing up

298
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,730
For his fellow firefighters.

299
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,560
What?You don't think it's worth a try 

300
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,910
consideringWe are kind offightin' for our lives here?

301
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,410
lieutenant,is shayserious about quitting 51?

302
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,930
She transferred to another house.

303
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,540
So yeah,i'd say she's pretty serious.

304
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,520
It's gonna be strangenot having her around.

305
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,130
I think this is just her feminine side kicking in,

306
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,790
Meaning temporary dramatics.

307
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:21,300
10 bucks says she's back here next shift.

308
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,530
Sergeant.

309
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,820
Well,you didn't return my messages.Figured i'd pop by.

310
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,760
Sorry about that.I'vebeen out on calls all day.

311
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,160
Somewhere we can talk?

312
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,330
Thanks.

313
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:45,020
Insane kings have been trying to take over that turf again.

314
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,340
Yeah,it's been pretty roughin my neighborhood lately.

315
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,380
I'll bet.

316
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,630
I noticed your brotherleon was in the kings.

317
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,820
He was.I'm proud to say he broke out of that life.

318
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,790
He's on the straight path,going to community college now.

319
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,950
Well,congrats on that.

320
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,740
Pretty tough getting out of the gang once you've jumped in.

321
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:09,010
It's lucky thing his boss flaco was killed in that humboldt park fire.

322
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,930
And that little twist of fate made a big difference,i bet.

323
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,910
See,i was thinking maybe leon could help us.

324
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,790
Our best shot,maybe our only shot,

325
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,410
is to put someone on the inside.

326
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,090
Shooter's bound to startrunning his mouth at some point.

327
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,430
you want leon to go back into the gang?

328
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,630
They'll sniff that out right away.They'll kill him.

329
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,510
Not if he plays it right.

330
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,410
We need his help,joe,

331
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,240
And i'm hoping we get it

332
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,720
Because as long as i'm focusedon bringing down the kings,

333
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,700
I won't have time to take a closer look at

334
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,570
What happened at that flaco fire.

335
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,200
Look. I don't know what you're talking about.

336
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,330
As far as i remember,thatplace burned to the ground.

337
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,420
You have a decision to make.

338
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,860
Come on in.

339
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,030
It's weird not having shay here.

340
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,120
Did you talk to her at all?

341
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,070
No. I left another message,though.

342
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,950
That suicide call's what started all this,and i.

343
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,250
I keep thinking that if i had just handled it differently,

344
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,430
Maybe she wouldn't have bailed on 51.

345
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,120
You can't secondguess yourself.

346
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,380
Shay made the choice to switch houses.

347
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,070
That's on her.

348
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,130
But i was hard on her.

349
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:12,210
You're the p.i.c. Buck stops with you.

350
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,060
When you're in charge of people,you.You can't always be best friends.

351
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,160
Don't beat yourself up.

352
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,400
Thanks.

353
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,230
Not to get all schmaltzyor anything,but.

354
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,730
Thanks for saving my life today too.

355
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,780
Yeah.

356
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,700
You've done that forme like a million times in the last few months.

357
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,030
I've been thinking about it.

358
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:57,120
And the truth is.

359
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,270
I don't know where i'd be without you.

360
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,220
i had some questionsabout stocking the rig.

361
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,920
You guys go through like ten times the amount of supplies i'm used to.

362
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,660
Yeah,sure.Okay,yeah.I can.i can.

363
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,040
- Help me out?
- Yeah.

364
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,050
Cool.

365
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,290
Ready?Lift.

366
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,350
Okay,take it down.

367
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,030
Good.

368
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,760
We're goin' again.Mouch,sit down.

369
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,780
Herrmann,take my place.

370
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,370
Mills,otis.

371
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,580
What the hell is goin' on?

372
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,730
Looks like casey's got someserious steam to blow off.

373
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,110
Extreme physical exertion,food deprivation.

374
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,430
Are we in some kind of ciatraining program i'm unaware of?

375
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,990
Stop it.She'll be here any minute.

376
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,130
Who is this she you keep talking about?

377
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,990
She's just a chef ata restaurant near here.

378
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,200
This long a wait?

379
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,100
Well,she'd better be a stripperchef popping out of a vat of pasta marinara.

380
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,940
Maybe i oughta just throwsomething together really quick.

381
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,930
If she shows up,i'll get out of her way.

382
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,530
Go ahead.She ain't coming.

383
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,930
Everything go okay with voight?

384
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,800
Yeah.

385
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,350
then why do you look like hell?

386
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,870
It's just been a rough day,that's all.

387
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:05,610
Have you ever worn a tux before?

388
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:10,120
- Prom.
- Well,you rock it.

389
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,810
You are looking pretty damn good yourself.

390
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,100
Thank you.

391
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,410
I think i got a plan ofwhat we're doing tonight.

392
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,180
- do you?
- Damn straight.

393
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,110
God,not here.

394
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,280
Champagne?

395
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,740
thank you.

396
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,520
Thank you.

397
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,690
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

398
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,550
So who's this wheeler guy?

399
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,160
State senator.Rising star.

400
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,380
I would love to run his next campaign.

401
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,570
xxxxxxxxxxxx

402
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,320
I've been told i'm on his radar.

403
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,990
come on.I see him.

404
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,090
I want to introduce you.

405
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,440
Senator wheeler.

406
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,240
Isabella,good to see you.

407
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,460
Good to see you too.

408
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,610
I'd like to introduce youto my boyfriend,peter mills.

409
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,920
Very nice to meet you.

410
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,110
Yeah,same here.

411
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:05,100
Senator,i had some thoughts i wanted to runBy you when you have time.

412
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,250
- Of course,anytime.
- Perfect.

413
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,970
Me and leon talked about it,and he doesn't want to do it.

414
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,030
So if you've got any dirtthat you got to dig up,go ahead.

415
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,180
That how you feel about it,leon?

416
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,080
Want to let your brotherroll the dice on this?

417
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,320
Sergeant?

418
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,920
Would you give us a second here?

419
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,380
Leon getting himselfkilled doesn't help anybody.And if he.

420
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,320
They took yvette offlife support an hour ago.

421
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,750
She's gone.

422
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,440
I'm sorry,guys.

423
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,800
We're talking about the murderof a 10yearold girl here.

424
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,340
You knew her.

425
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,550
It's obvious that you both cared about her.

426
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:10,930
I want you to help usstop all of this,leon.

427
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,160
Help us put away whoever did this.

428
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,780
We will be with you.

429
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,420
We will be with him every step of the way.

430
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,350
I promise you that.

431
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,860
So will you help us?

432
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,250
xxxxxxxxxx

433
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,340
no

434
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,490
xxxxxxxxxxxx

435
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,100
I gotta ask you a question.

436
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,290
the answer is yes.

437
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,860
Did you bring me here tonight

438
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:05,050
Because you thoughthaving a black boyfriend would help you get the job?

439
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,110
Absolutely not.

440
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:12,610
It's just,you know,yesterday,we were reconnecting.

441
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,860
Tonight,i'm your boyfriend.

442
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,200
It's. It's a quick promotion.

443
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,440
It seemed like the simplest way to introduce you,i guess.

444
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,860
Pete,i like you.That's why i invited you here tonight.

445
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,930
Okay.

446
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,500
I'm gonna grab a cab home.

447
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,810
Thank you.

448
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,600
Sullivan.

449
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,010
I have to make this quick,mcholland.

450
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,280
Have two meetings to get to.

451
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,830
I understand.I gotta get to work,too.

452
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,170
Did you have a chance to lookat chief boden's proposal?

453
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,020
I did.

454
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,040
Then you know we've got a good case,

455
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:57,260
But the union has to spearhead it or we can't push it through.

456
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,790
Problem is i can't do it.

457
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,240
Why not?

458
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,970
It'd be a pretty dumb move of me

459
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,420
To piss off state officials my first month into the job.

460
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,340
You can understand that.

461
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,750
Let's be honest.This isn't my fight.It's 51's.

462
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:29,730
I was handed a lot of dirt about you during the election,

463
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,100
And i kept it under wraps because i didn't think it was right for me

464
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,140
To personally benefit from airing it out.

465
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:40,390
But to protect my chief,and my brothers and sisters on the job,

466
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,650
I will shout it from the rooftops.

467
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,250
I assume you're referring to my ex trying

468
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,280
To chisel me for more child support.

469
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,690
Yeah,that probably wouldhave done some damage,

470
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,870
But the election's over,pal.

471
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,880
Go ahead.Climb up on that rooftop.

472
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,380
No one will care,and you'll come across like a bitter loser.

473
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,900
Lucy hofnagle.

474
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,890
She's in my book club.

475
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,100
You broke her heart,

476
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:18,200
Something your current wife would probably be surprised to discover.

477
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,880
no.

478
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:42,520
Voight threatened to look into what happened with the flaco fire

479
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,080
If leon wouldn't go backinto the gang undercover.

480
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,370
What?

481
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:57,760
But leon,he's gonna do it,lieutenant.

482
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,770
Our neighbor,this young girl.

483
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,280
She died.

484
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,410
He wants to help,and i can't stop him.

485
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,030
After everything i did to get him out,

486
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:19,620
Now he's going back in,and it was all for nothing.

487
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,150
Getting him out ofthere wasn't for nothing.

488
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,850
It was.All right,itsteered that kid straight.

489
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:32,370
You've done everything youcould for him,all right?

490
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:39,810
Now,you have to trust that he'll make it outon his own this time.

491
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,390
All right?

492
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,480
Chout's back.

493
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,990
I am going to kill this guy if i have to sit nextto him one more second.

494
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,250
You need to talk to shay.

495
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,070
I've tried,dawson.

496
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,720
Maybe you should go by the apartment,talk to her.

497
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,250
No,i've reached out.I've left messages.

498
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,700
She shuts me down every time.

499
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,040
She'd rather ride aroundwith that devon chick than talk to me.

500
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,590
I don't know what else i can do.

501
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,750
Ambulance 61,injury at 2909 north hudson.

502
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,280
Let's rock and roll.

503
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,730
Thank god.This way.

504
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,900
I heard someone coming in the back door.

505
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,440
I thought it was an intruder,

506
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,310
So i went at him before i realized it was just my neighbor luis.

507
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,310
You went at him?

508
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,680
Look,it's pulsating.

509
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,120
It's directly in the.

510
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,530
Heart.

511
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,230
My god.

512
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,320
If it moves much,we could lose him.

513
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,880
We have to stabilize it completely.

514
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,920
Grab a twoinch tape.We gotta secure the fork.

515
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,010
- Do you bake,ma'am?
- I'm sorry?

516
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:15,540
I need a bundt cake pan,the kind with a.A hole in the center.

517
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,110
Yeah,i. I got one of those.

518
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,330
Chout,i can't do this without you.

519
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:24,930
Let's rock and roll.Come on.

520
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,380
This should stop anythingfrom knocking into it

521
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,780
Or sending it in any deeper.

522
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,510
Hold that there for me,nice and firm.

523
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,540
Okay,let's get him on thebackboard nice and slow.

524
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,090
Did you see how impressedthat attending was when he saw the setup?

525
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:09,010
Yeah.

526
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,500
i got to ask.

527
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,640
What happened with youand your old partner,shay?

528
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,630
Sometimes partners go their separate ways.Happens.

529
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,370
Maybe she was intimidated.

530
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,110
You gotta bring theagame to be your partner.

531
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:23,760
You're.You're amazing.

532
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,020
Well,shay's pretty amazing too.

533
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,960
you know my buddyblair,the one i spelunk with?

534
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,880
His lake house party is this weekend.

535
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,370
You and me,we should go.

536
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,910
Together.

537
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,910
Chout,you're a really nice guy,but the thing is.

538
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,860
I'm taken.

539
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,100
it's betty crocker.Those home ec.Classesfinally paid off,huh?

540
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,860
Choot wants me totell your cake pan story on my next podcast.

541
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,790
Apparently,he's a big fan of the show.

542
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,780
- Sorry.
- no problem.

543
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,170
Come on,let's go.

544
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,500
Change at the bar.We'relate for deliveries.

545
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,790
You wanted to see me,chief?

546
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,480
Yeah. 

547
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:26,490
I just got a call fromcommissioner's office.

548
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:29,620
An injunction against mcleodand her bosses is in the works.

549
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,830
Glad to hear it.

550
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:58,350
It's just been really crazy.I'm sorry.

551
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,940
You were never planningon coming,were you?

552
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:10,120
I was ten when i met benny for the first time.

553
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:14,660
He held me really tight,and said how sorry he was

554
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,010
And how he was gonna be in my life.

555
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,410
How i was his daughter.

556
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:26,590
And i mean,i can't tell you how much that meant to me.

557
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:33,300
The next time i saw him was two weeks ago.

558
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,420
I'm sorry he disappeared on you,katie.

559
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,980
I'm really happy with my life right now,and i just.

560
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,380
I don't want to spend anymore of it 

561
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,740
worryingAbout anothertrapdoor that might open,

562
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:55,420
So i just really hope thatyou can understand that.

563
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,250
I can.

564
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,870
I'm not benny.

565
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,240
I'm proud of you.

566
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,680
clarke!I thought you were heading home tonight.

567
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,650
Decided it'd be better to come here.

568
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,340
All right.

569
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,590
Sometimes you need tostep away from a situation before it goes bad,

570
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,950
You know what i mean?

571
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,550
Yeah,sure.

572
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,600
- I'm glad you came then.
- Thanks.

573
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,380
I can't have you stepping out of line.

574
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,770
You got an ipa on tap?

575
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,230
Can you help this jarhead out?

576
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,000
Coming right up.

577
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,270
You drink too fast.

578
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,560
Not fast enough.

579
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,900
If i was drinking now,i'd drink fast too.

580
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,160
Because you're going back to russia.

581
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,160
Yeah.

582
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,370
I'm gonna miss you,joe cruz.

583
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:19,040
You know,maybe there's a solutionTo both our problems 

584
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,090
besides drinking too fast.

585
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,500
I say you marry me.

586
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,730
Joe.You say this because you are sad.

587
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:36,230
In russian,this is koleno reaktsii ryvokl.

588
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,490
I have no idea what those words mean.

589
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,880
I do know that i can't risk losing someone else i care about,

590
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,060
And i think that we could have something really great together.

591
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,870
Marry me,zoya.

592
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,910
Please.

593
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,890
Okay,joe.

594
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,800
Zoya and i are getting married!

595
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,020
That's great!Good for you,buddy.

596
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,070
let's have a drink to that.

597
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,750
Damn right we should.

598
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,540
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

599
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,600
Come here,you guys.

600
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,130
Here you go.

601
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,700
congrats,buddy.

602
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,740
That's really great.

603
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,520
They'll probably be married 50 years and have a bunch of kids,and.

604
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,690
this is insanity.Mymom's gonna be ecstatic.

605
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,020
I mean,over the moon,but this is insanity.

606
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,020
It's kind of.

607
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,530
What the hell?

608
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,950
Dude,the tv's gone.

609
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,490
Shay?

610
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,740
Shay?

611
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,730
My viper helmet.

612
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,130
are you okay?

613
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,630
What the hell is going on?

614
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,230
I gave devon a key.
