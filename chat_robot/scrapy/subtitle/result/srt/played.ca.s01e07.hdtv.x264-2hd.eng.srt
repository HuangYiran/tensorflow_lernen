1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,370
It's nine o'clock, you promised you'd be home.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,170
I know I'm still downtown, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,940
Can we talk about this when I get home...

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,010
<i>- Please, please... 
- Are you OK?</i>

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,030
<i>- Help! 
- John!</i>

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,380
Go, get in!

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,700
Let's go, let's go!

11
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,240
You know, it's a lot easier to sneak out on a full stomach.

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,060
Good morning.

13
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,520
You don't have to disappear every time we hook up.

14
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,050
A little breakfast never hurt anyone.

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,930
Unless you're a chicken.

16
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,730
It's just that, I have an early morning.

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,030
I got a meeting in a few minutes.

18
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,350
Look, if I stay for breakfast, then I'll be here for dinner,

19
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,890
and maybe, we'll catch a movie, a ball game.

20
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,510
- A month or so and it'll be dinner with your parents... 
- They live in Arizona.

21
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,390
Okay, fine, then it'll be your boss or a friend.

22
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,210
But, here's the thing, I just won't be there.

23
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,780
- I won't make it. 
- Maria.

24
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,970
And you'll pretend that it's fine but you won't trust me, you'll be jealous.

25
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,700
Hey, hey, come on.

26
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,800
You're about to break us up and we haven't even had our first date yet.

27
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,630
That's the best part.

28
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,710
I mean, I don't even know what you do for a living.

29
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,730
I like this.

30
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,970
Ethan, this isn't broken. Why do you want to fix it?

31
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,990
Because whatever it is you're scared of,

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,500
it's not me.

33
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,800
This, whatever this is,

34
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,710
it's real.

35
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,850
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,260
We've been on this case two weeks and there've been five more carjackings.

37
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,220
Kelly.

38
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,010
The latest victim. Jon Davis.

39
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,070
Father of two, beaten unconscious and relieved of his late model Audi.

40
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,650
We know these attacks are related. They go back almost a year.

41
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,740
Multiple armed crews all over the city. Millions of dollars in car thefts.

42
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,450
What we don't know is who's calling the shots.

43
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,500
Whoever's running the crews and moving the cars, they're serious, they're pros, alright?

44
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,830
Innocent targets, brutal violence.

45
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,080
We need to shut these guys down, fast.

46
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,800
- You've made some progress? 
- OK, so I've been making friends with these two.

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,120
Ryan and Alex. I met them at a street race.

48
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,260
- You were driving? 
- Are you kidding me?

49
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,150
Maria's the best driver in this whole division.

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,270
Seriously?

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,290
Yeah, my dad's idea of quality time was me holding a torque wrench

52
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,720
while he swapped out a gasket.

53
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,100
So these guys, are they partners? One of the two-men crews?

54
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,730
They fit the profile to a T.

55
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,770
Yep. Alex has a thug. He's got a rap sheet a mile long.

56
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,130
Plenty of carjacking, brutal violence. But Ryan's different, he's my guy...

57
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,670
I scored points with him driving, talking shop.

58
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,200
He's starting to trust me and I can tell he's not into the violence.

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,830
He says he's got a job coming in later today.

60
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,570
- "Coming in"... What does that mean? 
- We don't know. He won't give her the details yet.

61
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,170
- But he's agreed to intro me to his boss. 
- That's good.

62
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,330
A'ight. Let's get Maria prepped.

63
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,360
She's gonna be our primary, whatever she needs.

64
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,100
This might be her only chance to move up the chain, we can't miss it.

65
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,940
<i>Daniel, I want you close cover.</i>

66
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,370
<i>Jesse and I will hang back and be ready to move where the play takes us.</i>

67
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,290
Whoever we're dealing with, has no problem breaking what gets in their way.

68
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,000
<i>So it's only a matter of time until escalates and we end up with a homicide.</i>

69
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,140
Scooped the cold air intake from a guy in Pasadena.

70
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,120
Custom weld and polish.

71
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,150
And it gets you what? 20 horses, tops?

72
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,260
Drop nitrous in and you're talking 200.

73
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,540
For 20 seconds. Then you shred your engine.

74
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,540
Probably take you a whole tank just to get this beast up a hill.

75
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,700
You need something new, carbon fiber, CPU-controlled hydraulics...

76
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,150
When I'm red lining into a hairpin, I trust my car, not a computer.

77
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,030
Watch out.

78
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,050
- Here comes trouble. 
- I got him.

79
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,710
<i>Watcha doin' here, man?</i>

80
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,800
You know, I still can't figure out why a big guy like you is so afraid of girls.

81
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,770
Ease up. She's cool.

82
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,160
We have a meet, Ryan.

83
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,630
Yeah? Well, that's why she's here, I want her to meet our guy.

84
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,560
So what, you think you just gonna cut her in, is that what you're thinking?

85
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,540
Is that coming out of your cake? Were you even ask me about that?

86
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,740
Like a need your permission to make a move.

87
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,340
We need a driver. She's crazy good, you know that.

88
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,620
You need to get out of here, right now.

89
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,530
Or what?

90
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,170
Trust me, your boss is going to want to meet me.

91
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,740
K, drop it. He's here.

92
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,870
I'll tell you what, she's in, I'm out, man.

93
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,290
That simple.

94
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,960
We'll talk, alright?

95
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,580
Alright, here we go.

96
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,940
It's handshakes and small talk.

97
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,800
Got it, right?

98
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,570
- He just gave Ryan some money. 
- That's it, that'll be for the job.

99
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,460
- We're gonna stay on this guy. 
- Alright, I'll see you back at HQ.

100
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,440
- He says now, he means now, we do it tonight. 
- So what's the gig?

101
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,250
Well, come on. You said you'd cut me in.

102
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,930
- And I told you to disappear, little girl. 
- Did you?

103
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,300
You know, it's weird. I just zone out whenever you open your mouth.

104
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,730
How about I make you pay attention, bitch.

105
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,370
- Hey, hey, back off. 
- Calm down before someone gets hurt.

106
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,510
Oh, really? You think you're gonna hurt me? Is that watcha think?

107
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,510
Give me a reason.

108
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,990
- Arrrgh, get her under control, man. 
- Yeah, well, calm down.

109
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,330
- You said you need a driver, right? 
- This ain't chauffeuring, sweetheart.

110
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,920
- Let's go, you, me quarter mile, right now. 
- What do I get when I win?

111
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,010
My ride. We race for pink slips.

112
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,520
What the hell are you doing, Maria?

113
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,920
I want you to watch when I sell your car for parts.

114
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,270
You heard it.

115
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,270
What's wrong? You need a handicap, sweetheart?

116
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,510
I'll give you two car length, but if you don't have the balls, I mean...

117
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,260
Get in your car. I don't need no handicap.

118
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,910
We checked the target's photo against the database, nothing.

119
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,270
- Did you run his plates? 
- Also nothing. Where are you right now?

120
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,110
We followed him to a business, Vaughn Motorsports.

121
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,920
- He's still inside. 
- Kahli?

122
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,180
<i>It's a private dealership, exclusive high end car sales.</i>

123
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,370
Owned by Ellen and Davin Vaughn.

124
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,060
Looks completely legit.

125
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,470
I guess we're gonna have to go inside then. Take a look.

126
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,930
Your son needs a new car. Stuff like that?

127
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,510
Maybe I'm into some kind of sketchy business, see if they bite.

128
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,450
Read my mind.

129
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,140
Hey, if you can get me photos of VIN numbers on the cars,

130
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,050
I can run them, see if they're stolen.

131
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,490
- We just need one for a search warrant. 
- Alright, done.

132
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,950
- We should probably get changed. 
- Let's go get rich.

133
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,480
Quarter mile to the concrete road block.

134
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,940
First one there wins.

135
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,490
Keep your car.

136
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,240
All I want is to get in on your action.

137
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,440
Fine.

138
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,440
Pick us up tonight. We'll text you.

139
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,730
Normally we're by appointment only.

140
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,540
These cars are sick.

141
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,220
He has an exuberance for this sort of thing.

142
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,130
This is very last minute, I forgot my son's birthday.

143
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,030
So I'm in the doghouse here.

144
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,070
- Are you interested in anything in particular? 
- A happy son.

145
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,950
I promised him anything he wanted.

146
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,850
I don't know, he said 'chick-magnet'.

147
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,740
I guessing that's a sports car.

148
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,750
Well, Mr... Ross, John Ross.

149
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,320
We can get whatever your son wants.

150
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,890
- As long as you're serious. 
- Oh, I'm very serious.

151
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,380
I assume paying cash won't be a problem?

152
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,780
What line of work are you in, Mr. Ross?

153
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,130
Let's call it import and export.

154
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,440
Cash will be just fine.

155
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,320
Good. 

156
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,010
<i>The husband and wife are clean.</i>

157
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,520
I ran every VIN number you got and...

158
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,370
- Not one of the cars is stolen. 
- You think they have a chop shop?

159
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,020
No, cause the numbers are stamped all over the parts, right?

160
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,730
So one of them would have flagged by now.

161
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,490
They must be involved. Why else would this guy be there?

162
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,950
What are you doing?

163
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,120
I'm working.

164
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,080
Isn't that what we're doing here?

165
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,260
I don't know, is it?

166
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,720
Jesse, Daniel's waiting out front. We're going to back up Maria.

167
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,550
- Get moving. 
- I'm on my way.

168
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,580
<i>What are we doing here?</i>

169
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,510
I thought we were breaking into a car, not a house.

170
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,080
<i>- You ever boosted a Lamborghini? 
- No. Why?</i>

171
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,140
Engine lock, GPS tracking.

172
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,600
It's cleaner and faster if we snag the keys.

173
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,080
Especially when nobody's home.

174
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,460
<i>- You sure about that? 
- Yeah, I'm sure. Relax.</i>

175
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,720
Gotcha!

176
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,350
Let's do this.

177
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,750
<i>Here we go, they're in. 
We've got no eyes.</i>

178
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,150
Second floor. Is that them?

179
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,190
What's happening?

180
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,070
A light just went on upstairs, I'm texting Maria.

181
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,430
<i>Someone home.</i>

182
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,150
Guys.

183
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,590
I heard someone upstairs. Someone's home. We gotta go.

184
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,610
- Maybe we should bail? 
- No, no, we don't leave without the car.

185
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,370
Is someone there? What the hell are you doing?

186
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,430
<i>Hey, no!</i>

187
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,190
Get in there! Go!

188
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,450
You should have stayed upstairs, old man.

189
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,810
Enough! Stop.

190
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,700
I said stop!

191
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,250
Back off! He saw your face.

192
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,740
We have to deal with him.

193
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,330
We're not here to make a mess. We're here for the car.

194
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,830
Police! Show me your hands!

195
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,790
Get on the ground. On the ground! Get down!

196
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,260
- Show me your hands! 
- Get down!

197
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,550
Sir, you alright? You're going to be alright, sir.

198
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,480
I need an ambulance at 20 Peldar Street.

199
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,120
I have a civilian male, severe head trauma.

200
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,410
This isn't my first time either, so you can skip the tough guy stuff.

201
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,110
- We're both professionals, right? 
- Professionals?

202
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,150
Career cop, career criminal.

203
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,560
It is what it is.

204
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,670
Whatever you say.

205
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,020
I need an introduction to your boss.

206
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,190
For what? Maybe a couple years off my sentence? Maybe some early parole?

207
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,630
- I can talk to the prosecutor. 
- Yeah? That sounds good.

208
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,460
Except, I ain't no rat.

209
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,220
I can stand my time, bitch. So screw you.

210
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,670
Well, I have to say that's a relief.

211
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,250
Phil Bronte, the man at the house.

212
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,150
You put a grandfather in the hospital, Alex.

213
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,340
You're out of control, and you're a coward.

214
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,170
I was worried you might cut a deal.

215
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,200
You tryin' to play me?

216
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,250
No games.

217
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,520
Truth is,

218
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,090
I want you to go to jail for a long, long time.

219
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,190
And this non-compliance you're showing,

220
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,890
that means I can push for maximum sentence.

221
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,370
It's a good day.

222
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,240
Maximum sentence, are you serious in there?

223
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,310
It was no play.

224
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,450
Major crime can charge him. Make sure they take their time.

225
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,020
- OK. 
- So what now? We stick with Ryan?

226
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,380
Make him an agent, see if he'll work with us, maybe?

227
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,400
Maria?

228
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,350
We're going to need Ryan's help, he can get us to Zeke. Think he can handle it?

229
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,670
I don't know.

230
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,180
- You don't think he'll flip? 
- In a heart beat.

231
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,490
This just got real for him. He needs an out.

232
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,700
But working with us is a lot of pressure. I'm not sure I can trust him.

233
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,750
OK, so why don't you go in there, talk to him, see how it feels.

234
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,500
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

235
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,220
He's in rough shape.

236
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,590
- Can you give us the room? 
- Yeah.

237
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,400
All right.

238
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,140
Hey, Ryan.

239
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,650
You're a cop? Are you kidding me?

240
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,920
You're good, I had no idea.

241
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,250
You know what's stupid? I'm still happy to see you.

242
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:43,430
- It's always good to see a friend. 
- You're a cop.

243
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,600
Best friend to have right now.

244
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:47,580
So what...?

245
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,170
Are you going to, like, question me?

246
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,350
Make a report? Take me to jail?

247
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,430
Do I have a choice?

248
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,590
Everybody makes mistakes, you're mine.

249
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,320
My mom always said that to me.

250
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,700
That's a hell of a thing to say to her kid.

251
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,990
Yeah, but what I'm doing, stealing cars and all that...?

252
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,160
She hates it.

253
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,320
I don't blame her.

254
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,630
Look at me. I'm sitting here worrying what my mom's gonna think.

255
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,230
Last night,

256
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,270
you tried to stop Alex.

257
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,560
- He was beating that man... 
- So?

258
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,900
So you know what I think?

259
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,000
I think you're better than that.

260
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,770
Than him.

261
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,410
I can help you.

262
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,310
I can drop these charges but you have to help me first.

263
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,680
- What kind of help are we talkin'? 
- I need a way in.

264
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,090
We'll start with the guy from yesterday, your boss?

265
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,300
Work our way up...

266
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,180
Hey, if you aren't up for this, you need to let me know.

267
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,140
I need to be able to trust you.

268
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,600
Completely.

269
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,530
Can I trust you?

270
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,370
Let's start with the name of your boss.

271
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,880
The guy in the Hummer who gave you the job.

272
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,840
- Why don't you tell me who you work for? 
- His name is Zeke Weston.

273
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,990
<i>He's crazy violent.</i>

274
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,590
<i>Especially if you make a mistake.</i>

275
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,940
<i>Runs, like, ten crews of guys who jack cars.</i>

276
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,100
<i>He gives us a name, an address,</i> <i>we deliver the cars,</i>

277
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,780
<i>and Zeke makes them squeaky clean and legal.</i>

278
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,790
What happens to them then? How do they get sold?

279
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,230
- Do the clients know they're stolen? 
- I swear, I have no idea.

280
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,330
I'm just the help, right? And Zeke isn't much of a talker.

281
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,120
Can you bring me in as your new partner? You think he'd go for that?

282
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,010
Yeah.

283
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,460
I mean, I can try.

284
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,540
<i>OK, so we're going right into Zeke's garage,</i>

285
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,370
<i>with you getting busted last night, he's gonna be tense as hell.</i>

286
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,260
<i>So you got to keep him calm, he needs to feel like he's in control, alright?</i>

287
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,000
<i>Now my guys will be outside, they'll be listening.</i>

288
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,400
<i>So if we get into any kind of trouble, they'll be right there to back us up.</i>

289
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,190
Okay, you ready?

290
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,220
Take a deep breath. And remember, "I'm not a cop. "

291
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,660
Come on.

292
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,270
What the hell is she doing here?

293
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,230
I asked you a question. What is she doing here?

294
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,380
Come on, Ryan. Step up. You got this.

295
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,480
That job you gave us last night.

296
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,610
That was junk, Zeke. The guy was home, alright? Alex is done.

297
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:16,520
Yeah, Alex called me. From jail. He said you got busted.

298
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,330
That's right, I had to bail myself out, man.

299
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,210
Alex beat the hell out of the guy which is why he's still in.

300
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,210
Anyway, the point is, now I need a new partner.

301
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,870
Alright? That's what she's doing here.

302
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,480
I just wanted to clear it with you, out of respect.

303
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,880
Ryan gets very confused sometimes.

304
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,920
He says things he shouldn't.

305
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,080
- Where'd you meet her? 
- It's Maria.

306
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,200
- Racing pink slips out at Cherry Beach. 
- She can drive?

307
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,700
Gave him a spot, six car lengths. Still smoked him.

308
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,140
Who does she work for?

309
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,390
You. Starting now.

310
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,610
Come on. Come on...

311
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,840
We're done here. I do the recruiting.

312
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,610
Take a walk.

313
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,890
No sale.

314
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,750
It's alright.

315
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,370
Could be a first step, we'll stay on Zeke.

316
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,060
See what he gets into.

317
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,940
I have to say I'm impressed. Only five hundred production models built,

318
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,780
and last time I checked there weren't any left.

319
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,310
<i>- Where did you find it? 
- I have a number of suppliers.</i>

320
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,000
You mind if I take a photograph?

321
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:54,880
For my son.

322
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,730
These days if it doesn't happen in a photograph,

323
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,210
it never happened. Of course.

324
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,100
<i>- Ok, got the photo. 
- Do you think your son will like it?</i>

325
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,220
I hope so. It's his favorite color.

326
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,280
<i>Nothing. It's clean.</i>

327
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,760
I have friends overseas who'd be interested in this sort of thing.

328
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,440
- Is that right? 
- Of course, it would have to be volume.

329
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,560
But if you could move cars like this, 20 grand a unit?

330
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,980
20 thousands each? At that price they would have to be stolen.

331
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,050
You have the capacity for this sort of operation?

332
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,780
I ship things overseas, in containers.

333
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,370
Heavy machinery, textiles, that sort of thing.

334
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,630
Including cars.

335
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,390
Certainly possible, why not?

336
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,440
You're talking to the wrong people, Mr. Ross.

337
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,620
- That's too bad. 
- I'm sorry we can't help you.

338
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,440
Well, if you change your mind.

339
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,250
I'm going to show this to my son.

340
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,370
I'll be in touch.

341
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,340
Give our best to your boy.

342
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,770
- Once again, VIN was clean. 
- Nah, they've gotta be fake.

343
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,040
Khali ran the numbers. Paperwork's legit.

344
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,750
I ask for a car that's impossible to buy,

345
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,890
and they come up with one literally overnight.

346
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:29,550
- We have no way to prove that it's stolen. 
- Yeah, but the wife, Ellen, she was into the deal.

347
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,010
- She was already spending the money in her head. 
- It was the husband that backed away?

348
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,570
There was something going on there, plenty of tension.

349
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,890
These people are careful, we've seen that with Zeke.

350
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,440
They're smart, so we just have to be smarter.

351
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,020
- Yeah? 
- It's Daniel.

352
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,400
- Hey. 
- We've got action with Zeke.

353
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,340
- We followed him to a park. He's out of his car. 
- What's he doing?

354
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,130
<i>Looks like he's meeting up with the wife, Ellen Vaughn.</i>

355
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,270
- Just her? No husband? 
- Yeah, looks that way.

356
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,160
- Whoa, are you seeing this? 
- Yeah... Yeah, keep shooting.

357
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,200
- What is it? 
- Ellen and Zeke.

358
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,040
I think we just found a way in.

359
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,870
So she's married to the money, but she's sleeping with the muscle.

360
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,110
Yeah, this is more than a one night stand.

361
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,000
- You're sure? 
- Yeah, look at his hand.

362
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,080
On her back, there's a closeness between them, not an urgency.

363
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,690
She's looking into his eyes. There's trust there.

364
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,130
- This is real for her. 
- So how do we use it?

365
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,070
I'll reach out to Ellen.

366
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,570
If she's looking for an exit ramp for her and her boyfriend, I'll be happy to provide.

367
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,450
Meanwhile, Ryan delivers the photos to the husband.

368
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,600
He wants to prove his loyalty, and thought Davin should know what his wife is doing.

369
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,830
- He uses it as a chance to step up. 
- That's a lot of pressure on Ryan.

370
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,690
He can handle it.

371
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,030
Set up a meeting with Ellen, see if she bites.

372
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,820
All right.

373
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,170
- Hey. Nice job with this kid. 
- Ryan?

374
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,310
- Anyone could've flipped him. 
- That's not true.

375
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:04,110
You made a genuine connection. He trusts you, Maria, he believes in you.

376
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,800
He looks at me, all he sees is a get out of jail free card.

377
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,740
Don't be so sure.

378
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,930
We're just waiting on a signal. You remember what to say?

379
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,320
- I'm your new partner, right...? 
- Yeah. I'm good.

380
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,480
I'm gonna keep my distance, you got this.

381
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,860
I jacked my first car before I could drive.

382
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,660
Me and a buddy, we swiped this minivan, drove it around the block.

383
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,570
I bet it was a rush.

384
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,290
It sounds stupid but I always thought I wouldn't be able to do it.

385
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,950
Like it wouldn't be that easy or something.

386
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,500
Then I started learning security systems, ignition overrides.

387
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,410
I could boost anything with an engine.

388
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,590
We used to swipe cars from the airport lot.

389
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,890
No one got hurt. It's like it wasn't even real.

390
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,760
But these guys... Everyone gets hurt.

391
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,210
We'll shut them down.

392
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,490
I always thought cops were kind of lame.

393
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,520
But all this?

394
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,780
Way bigger rush than joyriding that minivan.

395
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,510
- I guess you're probably used to it. 
- It never gets old.

396
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,680
It's gotta be tough, though.

397
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,100
Always pretending to be someone you're not.

398
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,060
You ever just miss just being yourself?

399
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,860
<i>- Yeah. 
- You're good to go.</i>

400
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,900
Okay. Headed in.

401
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,090
You ready?

402
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,290
Yeah...

403
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,650
It's a nice day for a walk. I'm glad you called.

404
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,030
I wanted to apologize for my husband.

405
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,940
You don't have to apologize, I understand.

406
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,580
He's the overbearing, controlling type.

407
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:20,710
- Is that what you think? 
- I'll tell you what's clear to me.

408
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,500
Your partnership isn't working and if I were you,

409
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:28,350
I'd ditch him. I can move your cars, Ellen.

410
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,060
This was a mistake.

411
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,460
Ellen, you're the smartest person in the room and he won't even trust your judgment.

412
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,810
I didn't come here for an appraisal of my marriage.

413
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,320
You'll have complete autonomy, you'll obtain the product,

414
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,940
I'll move it overseas, where I will sell it.

415
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,830
What kind of business do you think I'm running, exactly?

416
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,100
Look, do you think I just happened to come out of nowhere?

417
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,120
I've had my eyes on your operation for some time now.

418
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,100
I can help you take it to another level if you want me to.

419
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
It's up to you.

420
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,210
- Mr. Vaughn. 
- Ryan, isn't it?

421
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,870
Zeke's not here.

422
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,130
Actually, sir, I wanted to talk to you.

423
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,800
The reason I wanted to see you...

424
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,970
Ryan, whatever it is, you can take it up with Zeke.

425
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,110
You need to leave now.

426
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,160
- This is too much for him. 
- Give him a second.

427
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,990
Photos just went down.

428
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,450
<i>No one knows. I swear.</i>

429
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:17,150
- Why bring this to me? 
- Zeke is out of control, he's dangerous.

430
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,560
This operation should be clean, low profile.

431
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,260
But Zeke's got crews putting people in hospitals.

432
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,750
Me and my partner back there, we'll do things differently.

433
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:30,070
So you want his job. You're an opportunist.

434
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,690
If I was, I'd be blackmailing your wife.

435
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,590
He's doing good.

436
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,250
Look, I get it. I'm nobody to you, I'm nothing.

437
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,680
But right now, I'm the one person who isn't lying to you.

438
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,560
Wait.

439
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,330
Come back tonight, we'll talk.

440
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,140
I thought for sure he wasn't gonna go for it.

441
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,000
- You did great in there. 
- So what's our next move?

442
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,670
We just blew up their entire foundation.

443
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,310
Now, we show Davin that we can help put it back together.

444
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,700
Looks like Ryan made quite the impression.

445
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,890
The dealership was shut up tight. No sign of Davin or the lovers.

446
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,720
I'm sure Davin is freaking out right now. He said he'd be in touch.

447
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,380
Hey, look at this, I got something.

448
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,650
I set up a fake website for John's import-export firm.

449
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,510
- Ellen Vaughn just paid it a visit. 
- You sure it's Ellen?

450
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,660
Yeah, I tracked the IP address, it's her, she's checking him out.

451
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,000
- That means she's interested. 
- She's making a move.

452
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,030
Her and Zeke, that's good. They're scrambling.

453
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,490
If we could set up a buy we could shut this whole thing down.

454
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:53,760
Oh no, it's Ryan. Something's wrong, he's panicking.

455
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,710
I gotta go.

456
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,640
- I got your text, what's wrong? 
- We messed up.

457
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,550
Zeke called me. He sounds really weird.

458
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,120
Davin must have told him that I ratted him out.

459
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,070
OK, slow down. Tell me what happened.

460
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,770
Zeke wants me to pick up a car from the drop spot, get it taken care of.

461
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,310
- What does that mean? 
- I did this once for him.

462
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:20,300
If we get a car that's too hot, Zeke leaves it in the drop spot for me.

463
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,020
I have to pick it up, take it to the crushers.

464
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,310
So if you get busted with the car, it's on you, and Zeke just walks away.

465
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,590
It's usually no big deal. But this time, something's different.

466
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,480
I could hear it in his voice. He was ice-cold.

467
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,030
You think he's setting you up?

468
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,090
The drop spot is isolated, there's no cameras.

469
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:38,210
- If I go there, anything could happen. 
- But we don't have a choice.

470
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,640
Zeke will get suspicious if we don't do what he says, right?

471
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,220
"We?"

472
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,150
You're not alone in this. Where's the pickup spot?

473
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,000
- It's back that way. 
- Let's go.

474
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,290
<i>Here come my guys. We're gonna check out the car, make sure it's safe.</i>

475
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,090
Hey, stay back.

476
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,530
We circled the perimeter twice, it's clear. We're alone.

477
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:14,750
Alright, which one?

478
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,340
Right there, red sedan. Keys are under the bumper.

479
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,350
It doesn't look right to me.

480
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,580
The back wheels are low. There's something heavy in the trunk.

481
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:29,610
Rebecca, we got eyes on the car, could be rigged with explosives.

482
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,700
Get everyone out of there, I'm calling the bomb squad.

483
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,540
Oh, no, wait a second, we know Zeke is reckless and impulsive.

484
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,970
But... a bomb? It doesn't make sense.

485
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,420
<i>Especially if it's personal.</i>

486
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,970
If anything, he's going to want to cave Ryan's head in with a tire iron himself.

487
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,400
I'm going to take a closer look.

488
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,690
John, are you listening to me? Keep your distance.

489
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,230
Rebecca, I'm losing you, you're starting to break up.

490
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,090
Roll ETF to their location now. Bomb disposal unit.

491
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,130
- What are you doing? 
- I'm gonna go take a look.

492
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,300
- I'm right with you. 
- No, no, no. Both of you stay put.

493
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,040
Only need one of us to be stupid.

494
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,130
John!

495
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,290
- Homicide's working on search warrants. 
- Too slow.

496
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,900
In the meantime, our happy couple disappears.

497
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,520
We're running out of time, we need to get a confession.

498
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,820
The good news is Ellen Vaughn has reached out.

499
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,230
She wants a meeting with John Ross, the exporter.

500
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,460
So we do a double play.

501
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:18,180
While I'm working on the wife, Maria could be working on the boyfriend, Zeke.

502
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:22,730
We gotta get a matching car, same make, model as the one we found the body in.

503
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,760
- Why? 
- So that Ryan can drive it back.

504
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,050
He got nervous, he looked in the trunk, found the body.

505
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,720
- Now he's gonna confront Zeke, all freaked out. 
- Seeing that car, the shock of it...

506
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,320
- They might just fall apart. 
- Yeah, that's a good plan.

507
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,610
- But does it get us a confession? 
- At this point, it's our best shot.

508
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,960
Okay, we're in position.

509
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,670
<i>- Good. Maria? 
- Good to go.</i>

510
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,890
- Stand by, we're waiting on John's signal. 
- Okay, standing by.

511
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,370
Any minute now.

512
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:58,290
Look, we don't know how Zeke's gonna react when he sees this car.

513
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,290
I do.

514
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,060
I got this, I know how to talk to him.

515
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,450
If things go South, you follow my lead.

516
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,060
Yeah.

517
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,790
When this is all over with, you ever thought about what you might do?

518
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,270
I've never been good at anything besides stealing cars.

519
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:21,800
- You're pretty good at this. 
- I'm no cop.

520
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,580
No. But we could put you on the payroll, and you could help us out.

521
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,780
- As a job? 
- Yeah, you're pretty good at this.

522
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,730
Might be worth it, just to see the look on my mom's face.

523
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,250
We want to move the cars, right now, fast.

524
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,950
They're all ready to go, the detailed list is in my office.

525
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,400
I don't need a list. What I need is the history of each vehicle.

526
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,160
In case any issues should arise.

527
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,450
They're untraceable. I do the work myself.

528
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:53,400
That's not much of an assurance. My clients need more than that.

529
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:59,120
We take the VIN numbers from wrecked cars, we copy them, and we put them on ours.

530
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,860
- But then there's no paper trail. 
- We make one.

531
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,890
You can look as deep as you want, all you find is a clean car.

532
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,670
We can discuss money in my office.

533
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,140
Of course. But first I want to pick up that present for my son.

534
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,770
- There's the cue. 
- Maria, you're on.

535
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,520
We've got them on the cars, now let's get them for murder.

536
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,650
OK, going in.

537
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,720
Is everything okay?

538
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,220
Fine. Let's step into my office.

539
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,680
- Get that out of here. 
- The car, or the body in the trunk?

540
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,690
- Will your husband be joining us? 
- No I'll be handling this.

541
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,530
All I need to know is if he's gonna be a problem.

542
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,490
- Can we get him on the phone? 
- I can't, he's unavailable.

543
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,380
What was the plan? I get caught dumping the car, go down for murder?

544
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,770
Was that it? Did you really think you could get away with it?

545
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,390
You don't know what you're talking about.

546
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,340
Yeah...? So tell me.

547
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,540
You need to shut up, right now. Move. Outside.

548
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,880
Come on, Ryan, let's go outside.

549
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,420
So you gonna kill me like you killed Davin, huh? You coward?

550
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,330
- Ryan, that's enough. 
- Daniel, Jesse, start moving in.

551
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,090
Let's go.

552
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,170
Come on, Ryan, let's go. You shouldn't have come here.

553
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,640
Tell me what happened, or else I'm going to the cops.

554
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,180
- Ryan, stop! 
- I told you to shut up!

555
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,710
Ryan! No...

556
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,510
John, he's got a knife, get over here!

557
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,150
Police get on the ground, don't move!

558
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,530
There's so much blood.

559
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,660
I need an ambulance at 151 Dumay, we have a civilian injured.

560
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,270
- Severe abdominal stab. 
- Shut up!

561
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,440
Ryan, listen to me, listen.

562
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,950
You have to stay still, okay. Ambulance is on it's way.

563
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:01,700
- It happened so fast. 
- I know, look at me, look at me.

564
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,840
I want you to picture your mom's face when you tell her you work for the cops.

565
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,630
She'd never believe me.

566
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,120
You're gonna be OK, you're gonna get out of this, OK?

567
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,190
The ambulance is on it's way. Ryan!

568
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,580
Ryan, Ryan, you're gonna be okay.

569
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,260
I don't even know your real name.

570
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,690
It's Maria. Maria Cortez.

571
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,820
That's a really pretty name.

572
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,400
It's okay, you're going to be okay. 

573
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,600
Ryan, stay still, please. Please.

574
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,630
<i>Please..!</i>

575
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,130
Mrs. Everwood?

576
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:25,650
My name is Maria, I'm a police officer.

577
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,190
I need to talk to you about your son, Ryan.

578
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,570
You people.

579
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,940
No, I don't know where he's living, and no, I haven't talked to him in a couple of years.

580
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:37,220
Uh, Mrs. Everwood. Ryan isn't in trouble.

581
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,040
He was working on a case, helping police.

582
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,590
Helping me.

583
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,990
Helping me.

584
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:53,250
Ryan's been injured, he was stabbed.

585
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,680
- How bad is it? 
- He lost a lot blood,

586
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:01,060
he's gonna need surgery, but he is conscious, and...

587
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,810
The doctors think he's gonna be okay.

588
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,220
I knew this was gonna happen, I've been waiting for it.

589
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,140
Your son stopped a lot of people from getting hurt.

590
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,880
He wants to make a change.

591
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,430
He's been asking for you.

592
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,130
- I can take you if you'd like. 
- Yes, thank you.

593
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,200
What? Maria's blaming herself.

594
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,830
That kid almost died.

595
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,840
She'll be fine. I'll check in with her.

596
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,480
This job.

597
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,600
You spend all this time with someone and then...

598
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,380
You arrest them, or...

599
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,870
They get stabbed...

600
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:09,320
But you made a connection. You opened up to them.

601
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,810
You know what the tough part is?

602
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,030
Going home at night to someone who loves you,

603
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:18,720
and you have to open up to them,

604
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:21,790
all over again.

605
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,970
- I'm sorry I didn't call first. 
- No, it's okay.

606
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,340
I'm a cop.

607
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:52,010
You wanted to know what I do for a living.

608
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:52,970
Okay.

609
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,410
And you were wrong.

610
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,730
I am scared of you.

611
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,960
You're the first guy I've connected with, in a long time.

612
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,400
And that kind of freaks me out.

613
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,030
