1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,760
If I could just have
everybody's attention real quick.

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,140
Um,on this wonderful occasion
- Our daughter leaving tomorrow for college...

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,910
If I could get everyone
to raise their glass

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,860
as I quote from one of our nation's great fathers
- Jefferson.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,210
George jefferson.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,840
"i never dreamed that one of my own "would be
going off to a university,"but here I stand,

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,250
a proud black man,knowing that all
those hours I put in at the dry cleaner

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,780
-phil.
- Not now,weezie.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,710
- Where was i?
- Quoting that president.

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,040
Okay,if she's the future of america,we
should start using chinese money now.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,790
We already are.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,100
My arm is tired.To haley.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,760
To haley!

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,240
And before everyone puts their glasses
down,uh,uh,we're also very proud of lily.

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,840
Tomorrow is her first
day of kindergarten.

16
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,780
- To lily.
- Oh,lily.

17
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,100
- To lily.
- To lily.

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,720
And you'll be impressed to know that she's
gonna be one of the smartest girls there.

19
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,830
- Lily,sweetie,what's the square root of 64?
- 8.

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,720
Nice trick.

21
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,940
- Hey,lily,what's the square root of this potato?
- 8.

22
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,360
Congratulations.You have a parrot.

23
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,620
We couldn't even get through the toast
to haley before you pulled focus to lily.

24
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,430
Oh,come on.It's-it's a big
day for both of them.Huh?

25
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,500
Haley going to college is a miracle.

26
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,140
Lily going to kindergarten is the law.

27
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,330
Well,haley and lily aren't
the only ones starting school.

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,660
My mom and jay are
going to parenting class.

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,850
We're doing it for the baby.

30
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,520
Not this baby.That baby.

31
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,960
Manny doesn't believe that
we know what we're doing.

32
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,410
A couple of new hairs under his arm,and now
he thinks he knows more than his own mother.

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,530
I know not to embarrass my son as he
stands on the threshold of manhood.

34
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,510
I don't know why I have to go to this thing.In
case you've forgotten,I raised two kids.

35
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,990
- Stop pulling my hair.
- Stop twisting my nipple.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,550
Shut up.Shut up.

37
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,070
Why look at me?

38
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,200
It was their mother's
fault.I was barely around.

39
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:50,990
No!

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,020
Haley,this is,like,the third bag
of makeup and hair care products.

44
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,580
Dad,if you want me to get good
grades,I have to look cute.

45
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,860
- Don't say a word.
- No.No.

46
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,190
- I agree with that premise.
- Thank you.

47
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,250
Wait.

48
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,120
Yeah,thank you.

49
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,710
Claire.

50
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,650
In haley's stuff,a box of condoms.

51
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,510
Yeah.Um,I-I bought those for her.

52
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,160
What?

53
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,720
Why don't you just buy her some
fishnet stockings and a nurse's outfit?

54
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,650
Not that that's my thing.

55
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,730
That just popped into my head.

56
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,100
Honey,she's an adult,and
she's going to college.

57
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,100
I want to be realistic.I don't
want her to get caught unprepared.

58
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,010
24 times?What,are you
buying her a 4-year supply?

59
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,920
Please.Phil,that would've lasted me
and my college boyfriend,like,a long...

60
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,480
Okay,we gotta hit the road.

61
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,300
Give your sister a hug good-bye.

62
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,550
- Don't dork up our room.
-Don't slut up your college.

63
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,810
Seriously,though,don't
study too hard,okay?

64
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,470
I'm totally going to have fun.

65
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,920
I'm iceland in the mock u.n.

66
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,030
Mom,we're gonna lose her.

67
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,430
I am doing my best.

68
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,390
Luke,come say good-bye to your sister.

69
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,370
I'm right here.

70
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,590
Bye,haley.Have fun.

71
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,810
Don't drink too much
beer and shots of tequila.

72
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,220
Why are you wearing that mask?

73
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,850
Uh,I like it.

74
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,720
He doesn't want you to see him cry.

75
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,660
He's literally masking his emotions.

76
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,140
- no!
- That's so sweet.

77
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,080
Come here.

78
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,890
It's not sweet.I'm an evil cyborg.

79
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,820
Half my face was burned off
in an industrial accident,

80
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,820
and the mask is hiding the
servos that control my mouth.

81
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,890
Yes,I am sad haley is leaving,but I'm gonna
be okay knowing I've done everything I can

82
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,230
to get her set up and prepared
and off on the right foot.

83
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,920
Not me.

84
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,900
When we're standing in her
dorm room saying good-bye,

85
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,430
it's gonna be one of the most
emotional moments of my life.

86
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,900
I'm gonna cry harder than the
first time I saw "air bud"...

87
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,610
Especially when I give her this.

88

life lessons I've learned,such as...

90
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,900
"always look people in the
eye,"even if they're blind.

91
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,950
Just say,'i'm looking you in the eye.

92
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,160
'" or...

93
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:25,160
"if you get pulled over for speeding,tell
the policeman your spouse has diarrhea.

Look how much fun you're
gonna have here,lily.

96
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,340
So many great toys to play with,and
you're gonna make so many new friends.

97
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,380
Oh,I wish I was in kindergarten again.

98
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,420
Oh,not me.Did I ever tell
you about david anthony?

99
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,930
He used to call me "cam the ham.

100
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,900
" Okay,lily's day.

101
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,290
Yeah,you're right.You know
what?It's gonna be a great day.

102
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,870
I'm just saying,it's difficult to grow
up with a name that rhymes with "ham.

103
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,920
" Hello?Mitch?Witch.Twitch.Bitch.Elaine
stritch.

104
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:55,600
What?

105
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,060
Not all bullies are straight.

106
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,030
Okay,parents.

107
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,040
We'll see you at 12:00.

108
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:01,800
All right.

109
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,820
This is when the crying starts.

110
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,920
Does it ever stop?

111
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,990
Come on,cam.

112
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,110
Okay.You know what,lily,sweetie?

113
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,580
I know this is gonna be difficult

114
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,850
- bye!
- Okay.

115
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,090
That was a knife to the heart.

116
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,120
No,it's...it's a good thing.Come on.

117
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,030
Oh,you know what?She forgot her snack.

118
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,860
Where'd she go?

119
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,670
That hurts!That hurts!

120
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,300
Oh,lily,honey!

121
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,540
Sweetheart,come here.Come here.

122
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,760
If you ever put your
hands on my daughter again,

123
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,960
I will string you up by your feet,run you up
the flagpole,and let the birds peck out your eyes

124
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,820
You understand?

125
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,450
Mr.Tucker,put that boy down!

126
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,730
He pulled my daughter's hair.

127
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,390
Please apologize to connor for using
your hands instead of your words.

128
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,640
Sorry,little fella.

129
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,560
- I would like to see you in my office.
- Right.

130
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,820
- Now,please.
- Me,too?

131
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,350
Caw!Caw!

132
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,610
Stop it.Leave him alone.

133
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,600
Mr.Tucker,what happened
out there was unacceptable.

134
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,130
I agree.Is this kindergarten
or "the hunger games"?

135
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,850
I'm speaking of your behavior.

136
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,050
We've never had an incident like this,and
now we've had one on the first day,

137
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,340
before circle time.

138
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,090
What the fudge were you thinking?

139
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,510
Now the boy's parents are coming in,and
trust me,they're mad as hello kitty.

140
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,830
Oh,you told his parents on us?

141
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,880
That is-that is so not cool.

142
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,720
Well,I'm sure once they hear what their
boy did,they will be understanding.

143
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,270
All right,whoever made our son
cry has messed with the wrong moms.

144
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,590
Lesbians.

145
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,340
While often lumped together,gay men and lesbians
have less in common than one might think.

146
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,380
Like in the venn diagram of
sexual identity,you have gay men...

147
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,840
And straight men.

148
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,130
Both the same gender.

149
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,660
Then you have gay men...

150
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,290
And straight women.

151
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,690
Both attracted to the same gender.

152
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,900
But gay men and lesbians?

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Nothing.

154
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,720
I am so sorry we have to meet like this,

155
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,920
but I'm sure you can understand,as
parents,the instinct to protect your child.

156
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,370
Yeah,it's what makes me want to
punch you in the neck right now.

157
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,770
I see where your son gets
all of his aggression.

158
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,530
Okay,let's all take a time-out.

159
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,340
That's a good idea.

160
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,340
- This is getting a little heated.Right?
- Yeah,pam,

161
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,520
we don't want another incident
like at the lumberyard.

162
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,820
Oh,my god.You guys go
to the lumberyard,too?

163
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,380
D
- I didn't know they had a ladies' night.

164
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,990
Not the bar,sally.

165
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:37,950
Okay,you know what?

166
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,200
He's trying to be nice,and
you just called him "sally.

167
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,150
" Yeah,you're not being very
helpful,peppermint patty.

168
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,960
Okay.Let's just stick
to our actual names.

169
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,230
Enough.

170
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,620
I'm gonna give you a
little homework assignment.

171
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,600
I want you and your kids
to have a family playdate.

172
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,410
Maybe if the four of you can get along,you
can set a better example for your children.

173
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,940
- I think that's a wonderful idea.Pam?
- Fine.

174
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,140
- cam?
- Fine.

175
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,620
We'll host,obviously.

176
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,410
"obviously"?

177
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,940
Well,I assume you have an unfinished
woodworking project at your house.

178
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,160
You've got a lot of nerve.

179
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,530
Yeah,and you've got half
a canoe in our living room.

180
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,250
I look forward to your frittata.

181
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,410
Why,are you visiting us in 2008?

182
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,750
- Oh,my god.
- Okay,thanks.

183
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,750
Baby for you.

184
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,770
You have some explaining to do.

185
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,020
I'm so sorry that you had
to find out like this,jay.

186
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,970
Wow,you two are really far along.

187
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,320
We're,uh,we're still
in our first trimester.

188
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,540
Ay,that's nice.

189
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,840
Yeah,we've been trying
to get pregnant for ages.

190
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,180
She's latina.You just
gotta look at her funny.

191
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:43,510
Okay,now that everyone has their
doll,let's talk about swaddling.

192
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,150
Now you want to start by turning
one corner of the blanket toward you,

193
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,980
like a diamond,and folding
the top down,like this.

194
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,030
I think they made a
mistake at the hospital.

195
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,460
Tough room.

196
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,440
Now we are going to pull
the other corner 'round,

197
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,120
and tuck it in nice
and snug like a burrito.

198
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,640
Done!I win.

199
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,650
It's not a race.

200
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,210
You're darn right.It wasn't even close.

201
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,020
Okay,it's good,but it's a little tight.

202
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,620
It's a burrito.You don't
want the meat to fall out.

203
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,870
Here.And try like this.

204
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,370
And see?

205
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,820
Now your baby can breathe.

206
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,380
I wrapped my son with one
hand while driving a stick.

207
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,580
I think I know how to keep a baby safe.

208
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,140
Man,I love being back in the dorms.

209
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,540
It's like I never left.

210
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,560
Throw up a david copperfield
poster,this could be my room.

211
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,090
Honey,haley and I have to
go fill out some paperwork.

212
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,820
Why don't you throw
the linens on the bed?

213
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay.

214
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,370
- Oh,my god.What is that shirt?
- Pretty sweet,huh?

215
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,390
"haley dunphy moving co." mm.see?'cause
we're moving you here and here.

216
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,660
And also...Here.

217
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,620
Man,you used to love it
when we swung you like that.

218
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,460
I bet we could still do it.

219
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,750
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

220
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,940
Oh,no,no.No,no,no,no,no.Don't
you dare pick me up!

221
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,730
And take that shirt off.

222
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,750
What?Why?

223
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,790
It's cute!

224
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,080
It's not cute!

225
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,370
Do you see what's happening out there?

226
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,610
People are walking around
and judging each other.

227
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,520
No,they're not.

228
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,420
Oh,really?You didn't see the way muffin
top across the hall was looking at me?

229
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,510
People can be cruel.

230
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,860
So take it off.

231
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,220
Fine.

232
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,040
Oh,my god!Put on a shirt!

233
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,060
I don't know what you want from me!

234
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,700
"you only get one chance
at a first impression.

235
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,110
I suggest julia
child,because it's easy to do.

236
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,600
" "save the giblets.

237
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,320
" Time to go to the beach!

238
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,220
You're gonna go to the beach with a dog?

239
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,370
- That dog on the beach.
- I don't know what I did to deserve this.

240
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,090
Yeah.

241
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,180
I want to show connor my toys.

242
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,970
Oh,okay.You do that,sweetie.

243
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,970
Hey,connor,uh,no hair pulling.

244
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,240
Thank you for that.

245
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,500
Okay,we have an assortment
of spring rolls here.

246
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,640
All vegetarian,of course.

247
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,760
Oh,'cause I'm a lesbian,i'm
automatically a vegetarian?

248
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,050
Well,I saw it on "the l word."
I assume they have consultants.

249
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,050
I'm just saying it's
an offensive stereotype.

250
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,670
Okay,pam,you are a vegetarian.

251
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,230
Knock it off.

252
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,220
Worked out.

253
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,850
Yeah.So glad that we are doing this.

254
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,130
Yeah.Yeah,me,too.

255
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,610
Yeah.Yeah.I mean,we're the
only gay parents in the class.

256
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,020
Yeah,we should be
supporting one another.

257
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,900
I mean,we have so much in common.

258
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:28,850
Exactly.

259
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,540
So...

260
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,120
Tell us about yourselves.

261
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,730
I'm an environmental lawyer.

262
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,230
Uh,and I'm a homemaker.

263
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,110
And-and,uh,and what do you do?

264
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,900
I'm a financial consultant.

265
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,280
I'm a contractor.

266
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,950
You thought I was a p.e.Teacher?

267
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,930
Well,figured.

268
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:51,990
Hey,I have a question real quick.

269
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,400
How do you guys get the
car seat on the motorcycle?

270
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,900
Uh,you know,connor is
having a birthday next week.

271
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,140
Maybe lily would like to come.

272
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,210
Oh,she would love that.

273
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,640
Oh,great.Are you guys having a clown?

274
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,320
Oh,god,no.I hate clowns
they're so creepy.

275
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,830
Maybe you just don't like
them because they wear makeup.

276
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,980
You know what?I'm out.

277
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,950
- Okay.
- pam.

278
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,220
Connor,we're leaving!

279
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,260
- Pam!- You-you don't
understand.Cam used to be a clown.

280
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,050
"used to be"?Once a
clown,always a clown.

281
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,730
God!Not now!Not now!

282
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,970
- Connor,let's go.
- pam.

283
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,850
What?

284
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,730
- Why is this door locked?
- Let me,please.

285
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,000
Lily,open this door right now.

286
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,580
Okay.

287
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,010
- I'm not hearing anything.
- I'm sure they're fine.

288
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,200
Oh,how are you sure?

289
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,840
- Connor!
- Lily!

290
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,710
- Connor!
- Lily!

291
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,160
Make the water comfortably
warm 90 to 100 degrees max.

292
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,440
And never leave the tub unsupervised.

293
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,020
Is there something you two
want to share with the class?

294
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,910
No.It's dirty.

295
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,190
Excuse me.

296
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,630
We're trying to arn here.

297
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,170
Don't worry so much.

298
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,720
Babies are tougher than you think.

299
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,700
When I was 5 years old,my
babysitter was a goat.

300
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,420
What?

301
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,250
Ay,please.You know about lupe.

302
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,510
You never said she was a goat.

303
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,810
You know,it's great that we have a couple
of experienced parents in the class.

304
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,410
Perhaps you can share some of
your wisdom with the rest of us.

305
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,070
Absolutely.It's not rocket science.

306
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,970
It's babies.They're hungry,you feed 'em.

307
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,560
They're teething,you
give 'em some scotch.

308
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,410
- Scotch?
- Really?Are you serious?

309
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,540
What?

310
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,280
So we left.

311
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,590
I didn't need a lecture
from mary poppins.

312
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,470
And I was suddenly in
a mood for a burrito.

313
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,190
I'd like admission to your student body.

314
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,810
Oh,my goodness!I am so sorry.I
thought you were my wife.

315
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,570
What's going on?

316
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,150
- He grabbed me and said
- I thought she was my wife.

317
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,300
My wife works out a lot.

318
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:53,950
dad?

319
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,190
How'd he grab you?

320
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,310
He squeezed my butt.

321
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,260
- He what?
- Phil!

322
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,410
I thought it was you!

323
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,800
Believe me,sir.I'm a respected realtor.

324
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,950
This is an innocent mistake.

325
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,610
Honey,turn around and
show him your-your butt.

326
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,630
It-it's uncanny.

327
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,310
Dad.I am very normal.

328
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,810
Please do not judge me based on them.

329
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,630
Are those your my little pony sheets?

330
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,650
What?No!

331
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,650
I ordered them online.

332
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,100
They must've sent the
wrong ones.I'm very sorry.

333
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,390
That's what was in the box.

334
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,920
Okay.Uh,for the record,I
am a respected realtor.

335
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,500
Those are not my condoms.

336
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,790
She bought 'em.

337
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,850
Oh,my god.

338
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,060
Apparently,that's what people do these days
- Buy condoms for their kids.

339
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,220
When I went to college,my parents
bought me a bicycle helmet.

340
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,620
That was their idea of safety.

341
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,200
Certainly didn't need condoms.

342
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,560
Mm,not if you were wearing a bike
helmet around campus,you didn't.

343
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,240
Am I right?

344
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,500
Why don't we let you guys
finish,and we'll come back later?

345
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:45,630
- Okay.
- Okay.

346
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,930
Yeah.Yeah.Yep.Yeah.Yeah,that
sounds good.

347
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,630
See you on parents weekend!

348
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,200
They seem nice.

349
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,050
- Guys...
- I know.

350
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,920
I know.Look,we need
to reorganize a little.

351
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,970
Your dad will go out and
get us some new sheets.

352
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,520
You and I can hang up all
the pictures on the walls.

353
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,100
You know what?I think it's
best if you guys get going.

354
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,250
But we-we wanted to help you,sweetie.

355
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,080
No,I got it.

356
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,210
W
- what if you wanna move the furniture around?

357
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,250
And we were gonna take you
to dinner before we left.

358
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,670
I like the furniture where
it is,and I'm not hungry.So...

359
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,140
- Okay.
- Okay.

360
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,020
Um,well,uh,before we leave,I
wanted to give you a little present.

361
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,110
It's actually not a little present.

362
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,730
It's probably the best
present you're ever gonna get.

363
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,000
It's a collection of all the things I've learned
- thanks.

364
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,700
Attention.Dorm meeting
in the common room.

365
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,090
Okay,so...

366
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,250
I better go.

367
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,520
- I know.
- Okay.

368
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,070
Okay,come here.That's my girl.

369
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,320
- Let me get in there.
- Okay.

370
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,240
All right.

371
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,890
- bye!
- bye.

372
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,280
"the most amazing things that
can happen to a human being "

373
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,000
will happen to you if you
just lower your expectations.

374
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,100
" Oh,they've got
something over the hole.

375
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,940
- Lily!
- Connor!

376
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,430
We can't see anything from outside.

377
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,640
The curtains are closed.

378
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,530
Open up,connor!

379
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,410
We'll let you have a hot dog!

380
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,960
What if something happened to them?

381
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,520
What kind of hazards
do you keep in there?

382
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,430
Well,let's see.That's where we keep our
gun collection,our abandoned refrigerator,

383
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,030
and our chocolate-covered
hypodermic needles.

384
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,610
Why are gay men always so sarcastic?

385
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,070
- It's my coping mechanism!
- Okay,that's it!

386
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,650
lily,connor,if you can hear me,back away
from the door.I'm gonna break it down.

387
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,440
- I'll help you.
- I don't want connor to go!

388
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,810
I wanna stay!

389
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,320
Oh,thank god they're alive!

390
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,420
I love him!

391
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,900
No,you love the idea of
him.Now open this door,sweetie.

392
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,280
Can we really have hot dogs?

393
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,910
Yes,we promise.

394
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,890
Come here,sweetheart.

395
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,490
If you ask me...

396
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,190
Sometimes we focus too
much on our differences.

397
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,130
There's one thing that
all parents have in common.

398
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,200
When it comes to the safety and well-being
of our children,we're all a little bit nuts.

399
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,390
You have dainty little
hands,just like your daughter.

400
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,960
You have boots like my dad.

401
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:01,740
I'm not saying that the goat put
me to sleep or brushed my teeth.

402
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,430
It just stayed outside my bedroom
window and scared all the strangers away.

403
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,410
Well,I'm not gonna lie.I'm
a little disappointed.

404
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,600
Hey,kid!

405
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,230
Jay,mom,how was class?

406
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,120
It was great.

407
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:16,540
It was very educating and
- And now we know everything about the baby,no?

408
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,010
Interesting,because your teacher called,and
you forgot your sunglasses when you left...

409
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,430
Three hours early.

410
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,000
Ay,manny,don't be mad.

411
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,720
I'm not mad.Just disappointed.

412
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,420
I hate this.I prefer when he screams.

413
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,910
Manny,it's no big deal.

414
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,290
They weren't telling us
anything we didn't already know.

415
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,620
We're going to have a baby.

416
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,340
Am I the only one who's terrified?

417
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,250
But why?

418
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,090
why are you so terrified?

419
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,840
What if it doesn't know not to pick up knives
or stick its finger in an electric socket?

420
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,430
You were pretty lax,mom.

421
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,000
I was the one who told you to turn the pot
handles towards the stove so I couldn't reach them.

422
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,010
Manny,I didn't worry about those things
because you worried for the both of us.

423
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,380
What if this baby doesn't
think things through?

424
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,310
It's part jay.

425
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,480
No offense taken.

426
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,940
If the baby's
different,we'll be different.

427
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,410
When you were growing up,you had to
be  the man of the house and the kid.

428
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,510
Now I'm here.

429
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,680
You just have to be the kid.

430
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,200
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to the baby,

431
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,520
just like I'm not ever gonna
let anything happen to you.

432
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,160
Okay?

433
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,660
Okay.

434
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,010
That is a load off.

435
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,210
Although you forgot to pick me
up last week after tango class.

436
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,700
We didn't forget.We were
just ten minutes late.

437
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,440
Ten minutes is a long time
in a sketchy neighborhood.

438
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,300
Please.It was between a
gymboree and a pottery barn.

439
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,510
"dance until your feet hurt.

440
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,570
"sing until your lungs hurt.

441
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,590
Act until you're william hurt.

442
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,510
" How you doing?Are you okay?

443
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,140
Yeah.No,I'm.I'm-i'm-i'm
good.You?

444
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,380
Fine.Yeah.

445
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:51,990
Great.

446
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,970
"Take a lesson from parakeets.

447
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,120
"If you're ever feeling lonely,just
eat in front of a mirror."

448
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,380
"never be afraid to
reach for the stars,"

449
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:19,550
because even if you fall,you'll
always be wearing a parent-chute.

450
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,610
"   tm."

451
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,780
haley.Hi,honey.You okay?

452
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah.Where are you guys?

453
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,010
Almost home,honey.

454
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,870
Dad,I really like that book.

455
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,430
You do?

456
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,800
Sweetheart,is everything okay?

457
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:42,580
Yeah,I just wanted to say thank you
for everything,you know,today and stuff.

458
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,370
- O- of course.Of
course.- Sure.

459
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,140
If-if you need anything
at all...You just call us.

460
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,990
I'll probably need
some more condoms soon.

461
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,700
Not funny.

462
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,120
I'm sending you some care bear sheets.

463
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,580
Anyway,I should probably get
going.We have orientation at 7:00 a.m.

464
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,360
G
- good luck with that,sweetie.

465
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,570
I love you,guys.

466
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,160
