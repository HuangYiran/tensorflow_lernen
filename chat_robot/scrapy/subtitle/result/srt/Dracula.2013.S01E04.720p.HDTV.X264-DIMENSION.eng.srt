1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,960
<i>Previously on Dracula...</i>

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,650
Daniel!

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,650
...ALECANDER GRAYSON...
...THE WHOLE OF MY WORLD...

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,580
Grayson.

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,090
I give to you wireless power.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,150
Experiencing some technical difficulties, sir.

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,840
- I'd swear. - We've met?

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,200
Yes, I was thinking the same thing.

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,610
How long must I spend skulking in the shadows?

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,920
I wanna walk in the sun like any other man. Sir, the sun.

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,530
Damn.

12
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,220
Be my husband, and I will be your wife.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,670
What are you thinking about? You.

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,080
I was thinking about Lady Jayne Wetherby and her vampire hunting, of course.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,680
Now that the seers are dead, he will much more easily attract others of his kind.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,340
Soon, London will be crawling with the vermin.

17
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,020
Lady Jayne is a huntsman.

18
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,210
Seems the Ordo Draco is more forward-thinking than I gave it credit for.

19
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,310
Strange times.

20
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,250
Wonderfully strange.

21
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,790
- You'll kill her. - If I kill her,

22
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,520
the Order will just send somebody else to replace her.

23
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,530
You'll end it with her. Now why would I do that?

24
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,640
She's a vampire hunter.

25
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,320
Renfield, not only will I evade her slightest suspicion,

26
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,310
I'll take from her a prize she's given no other man.

27
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,010
Her love. No.

28
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,950
Something far more precious...

29
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,830
Her trust.

30
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,480
Make a reservation tomorrow night,

31
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,550
8:00, for two at the Savoy.

32
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,910
The most exclusive, visible table in the main dining room.

33
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,080
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,300
Hello, master.

35
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,080
Given the extent of the putrefaction,

36
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,870
I say the female is the youngest, five years sired, maybe less.

37
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,570
This one, on the other hand, is clearly much older, a century undead at least.

38
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,800
I mean, that said, neither of the vampires are old enough to be the ones that killed our seers.

39
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,360
But the one who eluded you?

40
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,200
There, sire, I suspect, which would make him older still.

41
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,020
Old enough to be the one we're searching for?

42
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,530
Oh, he will be a formidable opponent.

43
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,540
Too formidable? If so, Mr. Browning, then God help you,

44
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,280
because if I can't kill the beast, no one can.

45
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,050
Josef Cervenka.

46
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,520
My right hand.

47
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,680
Maybe.

48
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,140
A long time ago.

49
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,520
Nonsense.

50
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,420
You are once more under my battlements.

51
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,740
I summoned you here for a reason, and very soon,

52
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,780
we shall destroy our greatest enemy. The Ordo Draco?

53
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,890
The same.

54
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,280
Rich men who've bet their future on oil, but I've discovered a technology that will destroy them.

55
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,340
But they are stronger than ever. Precisely.

56
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,030
Just this night, I saw two of my brood slaughtered by a huntsman,

57
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,440
a female of all things.

58
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,410
That's why I need your help.

59
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,240
I know her.

60
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,660
Then we will peel the flesh from her bones.

61
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,590
Not yet.

62
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,680
We cannot defeat them by killing them one by one.

63
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,330
We must attack the source of their power. Their wealth.

64
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,020
To pick their pockets like a common thief?

65
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,810
There's no honor in that. I'm sorry, sir. I heard voices.

66
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,690
Renfield, this is my old friend Josef Cervenka.

67
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,450
He will be staying in this house as long as he wishes.

68
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:01,200

德古拉 第一季第04集</font>

<font color=#4096d1>-=破烂熊字幕组=-
时间轴：二小姐</font>

71
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,210
Such a shock.

72
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,570
As a boy, Daniel was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat.

73
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,660
I supposed it was just a matter of time before it gave out.

74
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,080
Still, he was so young to die of a heart attack.

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,700
Maybe I should just thank the lord for the time we did have together.

76
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,580
We shall drape the walls and the ceiling with garlands of peonies and apple blossoms.

77
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,050
What do you think, Harker?

78
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,950
Oh, whatever pleases Mina.

79
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,980
I want this engagement party to be perfect for her.

80
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,450
Thank you, Mr. Grayson. Are you quite sure...

81
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,400
Of course.

82
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,340
It'll be honor to host your engagement party.

83
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,020
And candelabras. Silver candelabras everywhere,

84
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,790
on the tables and in all the floral arrangements.

85
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,660
Candelabras it will be.

86
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,660
Mina? Mina, darling, come here.

87
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,700
I want to show you how you're going to make your entrance.

88
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,300
One moment.

89
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,280
I want you to tell me what you think about General Arthur Ogilvy.

90
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,460
It seems he's the military's leading advocate for war against the Ottoman Empire.

91
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,900
Well, appearances can be deceiving. Explain.

92
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,020
In private, he opposes the war.

93
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,570
The real advocate is his number two, General Colin Shaw, the war hero.

94
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,390
Very popular in the public sphere.

95
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:05,320
Hmm, and yet this war hero is willing to spill an ocean of blood to control the region's vast oil reserves.

96
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,850
But General Shaw believes the Ottomans are a real threat.

97
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,980
You're not suggesting he's advocating war for personal financial gain.

98
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,040
He's a puppet.

99
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,720
Powerful men have staked their fortunes

100
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,200
on the presumption that the future will be fueled by oil.

101
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,190
It seems they've not only declared war on the Ottoman Empire, but on Grayson energy.

102
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,970
You and me and everything we worked so hard for.

103
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,400
Head up, Lucy.

104
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,610
You don't walk down the stairs, you glide.

105
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,900
I want you to find out everything you can about this General Shaw, Harker.

106
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,160
His weaknesses. His failures.

107
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,540
Unless, of course, you'd like to stay here and discuss floral arrangements.

108
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,450
Leave it with me.

109
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,260
Mina.

110
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,550
Make your entrance from down here.

111
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,450
Fireworks, we must have fireworks with our aperitifs.

112
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,770
Lucy, do stop. You'll make Mr. Grayson regret his hospitality.

113
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,750
Nonsense. We're ready for another test run.

114
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,890
Ladies, this is my chief engineer, Mr. Kowalski.

115
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,070
I'll be down in a minute.

116
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,260
Is he referring to the resonator machine?

117
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,810
- Are you testing it now? - Just routine.

118
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,030
If you'd like to stay and watch, you can.

119
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, lord, Mina, must we?

120
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,880
Miss Westenra.

121
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,600
If you wish to leave, I can easily arrange

122
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,540
a second carriage for Miss Murray.

123
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,690
Enjoy, as always.

124
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,080
I presume everything is in order, Mr. Kowalski.

125
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,880
Commence stage one.

126
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,040
Stage one!

127
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,270
Mark!
(1)

128
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,830
Stage two! Mark!

129
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,230
Temperature reading? Steady.

130
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,350
Well inside specification.

131
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,850
The night of the party, you could've fried an egg on this.

132
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,280
- Is everyone okay? - Are you unhurt?

133
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,800
We're fine, we're fine. What happened?

134
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,210
The cooling system performed perfectly, illustrating the weakest link in the design.

135
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,860
The metal used for the casing. Renfield.

136
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,680
I'll initiate a survey of all the British steel manufacturers that work with nickel-steel alloys.

137
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,760
Thank you.

138
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,150
I don't suppose nuts and bolts can measure up to your stock in trade.

139
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,260
Sorry?

140
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,800
Why, flesh and blood, of course.

141
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,380
There can be no higher calling than the practice of medicine.

142
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,440
The ability to save lives makes all our efforts here seem trivial.

143
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,890
Thank you, Mr. Grayson.

144
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,270
Resemblance? No. She is Ilona.

145
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,340
My wife died four centuries ago.

146
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,930
I know. I was there. Then she has been born again,

147
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,720
and the fates have returned her to you.

148
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,660
Now, you listen to me, Josef.

149
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,020
You must never again mention Mina Murray's resemblance to my wife.

150
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,320
Do you understand me?

151
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,640
Never. To anyone.

152
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,010
- Where are you going? - Out.

153
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,900
Perhaps a glass of champagne to kill the time?

154
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,620
No, thank you.

155
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,640
What a lovely surprise.

156
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,270
I'd expect you to be at the florist up to your neck in peonies and apple blossoms.

157
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,610
- Is something wrong? - No.

158
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:45,000
Listen, um, I've been reconsidering the idea

159
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,170
of having the engagement party at Carfax.

160
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,860
Why?

161
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,850
Well, I-I feel uncomfortable.

162
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,220
It's a huge imposition, and, well, frankly,

163
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,930
I don't understand Mr. Grayson's motives for hosting it.

164
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,160
I mean, you're just one of his employees after all.

165
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,700
Well, I'd like to think I'm a little more than just that.

166
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,780
Yes, of course.

167
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,270
I don't know why he's so interested in...

168
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,110
In us?

169
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,950
He's assumed this very intense involvement

170
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,850
in our relationship as if he's a part of it somehow.

171
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,840
Well, that's because, I suppose in a way, he is.

172
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,080
When we split up, it was Mr. Grayson

173
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,970
who took me aside and made me realize what a fool I was.

174
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,490
He made me see you and respect you for who you are,

175
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,730
not just a prospective wife and mother,

176
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:45,650
but a woman with aspirations every bit as important as my own.

177
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,610
He did that?

178
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,370
Yes.

179
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,970
I didn't wanna tell you.

180
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,450
Look, I know you hate all of this bother over arrangements...

181
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,760
Very much so.

182
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,840
So let Lucy handle them.

183
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,180
She lives for it.

184
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,840
All you have to do is turn up on time for the party.

185
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,170
And in the meantime? Bury yourself in work.

186
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,830
You're right.

187
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,740
Of course you're right.

188
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,120
Once you have graded those papers,

189
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,690
you will find in university storage 18 recently slaughtered lambs.

190
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,450
Extract the hippocampus from each

191
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:39,300
and prepare them for dissection by the neurology students.

192
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,920
I shall be back in a couple of hours.

193
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,950
Try not to disappoint me.

194
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,210
Is there something wrong?

195
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,860
Actually, I'd hoped for something a little less prosaic.

196
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,330
Now, now, Mina. We mustn't get ahead of ourselves.

197
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,970
Better to be the tortoise than the hare, yes?

198
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,000
Anything but the lamb, I suppose.

199
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,420
What is this witchcraft?

200
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,730
Science.

201
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,210
If this works, then we shall walk in daylight.

202
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,640
To walk in the sun?

203
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,230
Can you imagine us, liege?

204
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,710
Immortal,

205
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,570
invincible by night and by day.

206
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,120
Yes, yes, it is all very thrilling, I'm sure.

207
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,830
Noroc.

208
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:26,220
I can feel the sun. I can feel its warmth.

209
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,780
Master.

210
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,520
No.

211
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,550
Josef. No.

212
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,180
Yes.

213
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,410
Yes, it worked.

214
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,810
You call this a success? Don't you see?

215
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:50,330
It works, but only in the tissue surrounding the injection site.

216
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,580
Without a functioning heart,

217
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,610
the serum cannot be distributed throughout your body.

218
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,570
All we need now is a dispersion agent.

219
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,640
No.

220
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,370
The problem is one of mechanics, not chemistry.

221
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,840
The heart is simply a pump, nothing more.

222
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,740
If we can make mine function,

223
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,130
the problem is solved, correct?

224
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,380
Yes.

225
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,820
??????

226
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,200
These cells are alive.

227
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:56,790
So?

228
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,930
Blood cells die within an hour or so of extraction.

229
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,410
This slide is dated 1887.

230
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,780
That's nine years ago.

231
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,050
And this is why you couldn't meet me at the florist? That makes no sense.

232
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,790
What I can't understand is how you can maintain

233
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,310
such a willful disinterest in your own engagement party.

234
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,830
What?

235
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,310
Honestly, Mina, it's like talking to a man sometimes,

236
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,470
nose buried in whatever silly thing has captured his attention.

237
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,530
Lucy, what's wrong?

238
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,800
I hate this.

239
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,210
Lucy, I-I don't understand.

240
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,010
You wouldn't, would you?

241
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,700
You're not the one attending to every detail

242
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,740
for an extravagant party to celebrate the end of the only thing

243
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,380
that's ever mattered to her.

244
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,710
Lucy.
It's true.

245
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,650
Things will never be the same.

246
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,720
We will always be friends.

247
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,850
Oh, Mina, darling.

248
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,490
You are so terribly clever, yet so terribly stupid.

249
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,960
No, you are to be married, and that is that.

250
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,830
You understand?

251
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,180
No.

252
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,340
I don't.

253
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,230
Get your things. We'll go to the cafe.

254
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,450
There's a million things to talk about.

255
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,810
I am sorry, sir, I am assured my lady will be down presently.

256
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,210
I have all the time in the world.

257
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,850
Sir.

258
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,590
Mr. Grayson. How unexpected.

259
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,690
I must apologize for my absence from dinner at the Savoy.

260
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,150
It was as inexcusable as it was unavoidable.

261
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,610
Oh, please, I had forgotten about it entirely.

262
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,620
I was hoping I might make amends by requesting the pleasure of your company this evening.

263
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:20,280
If there is one thing I find tiresome about you Americans, it is your relentless optimism.

264
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,830
I promise you a spectacle that you will not soon forget.

265
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,240
Come now, Mr. Grayson.

266
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,210
Surely, a man of your affluence

267
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,490
can find a dinner companion for the evening.

268
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,480
Certainly.

269
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,560
It's just that this particular diversion is beyond the petty refinements of other women.

270
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,850
Only you possess the sensibilities to appreciate it fully.

271
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,550
Your flattery is too obvious.

272
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,080
Flattery is a dull blade that I would never employ against one such as yourself.

273
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,300
This diversion, if it displeases me, you will agree

274
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,920
not to call on me ever again.

275
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,660
- Yes. - Really?

276
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,120
Elsa, from the kitchen.

277
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,490
Oh, dear.

278
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,930
I trust she has no close relatives.

279
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,560
Like all our staff, none close enough to note her absence,

280
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,120
though I will miss her apple crumb cakes.

281
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,240
Bloody Cervenka.

282
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,200
I've interviewed three men from Shaw's regiment,

283
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,350
two political opponents and an adjunct who was dishonorably discharged,

284
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,970
and none had a bad word to say. You sound disappointed.

285
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,400
No, I'm not disappointed.

286
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,790
It's just I don't understand why Grayson's so interested.

287
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,450
I mean, frankly, I've admired Shaw since I was a boy.

288
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,250
I actually chose him for a subject for a biography in school.

289
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,540
Do you wanna know something very, very odd?

290
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:27,670
What?

291
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,820
For all my recent digging, I've not been able to uncover

292
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,340
one single fact that I didn't include back then.

293
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,740
Perhaps there is nothing more to tell.

294
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,580
- That's why. - Perhaps.

295
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,660
Tell me something, Szabo.

296
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,100
Have you ever met a man without any secrets?

297
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:54,040
I've destroyed over half a dozen Nosferatu in the last week alone,

298
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,180
and they are summoned by their sire.

299
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,500
Now, I-I share your concerns about the American,

300
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,260
but he is hardly the greatest threat that we face.

301
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,580
Agreed, but we must not underestimate Grayson nor the power of his purse.

302
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,640
Making inroads with his man Harker is a start, but nonetheless.

303
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,120
Yes, I think Grayson does bear scrutiny.

304
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,600
I agree with Jayne. The Order needn't be involved.

305
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,680
I shall see to it personally. Good. Keep me informed.

306
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,780
Ah, our distinguished guests have arrived.

307
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,610
Welcome, General Shaw, General Ogilvy.

308
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,900
My lady. My lord.

309
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,090
Please, gentlemen, sit down.

310
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,120
So, general,

311
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,220
you assured us total control of the Persian oil fields by March.

312
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:49,100
Yes, of course, but as you may know, the situation has become much more complex.

313
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,060
How so? Please explain.

314
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,160
May I? Of course.

315
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:58,460
Our provocateurs have been unable to foment so much as a border skirmish

316
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:04,250
since the sultan issued a decree to his men to stand down under pain of death.

317
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,230
So you see, there's little we can do,

318
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,040
save a full-scale preemptive invasion.

319
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,710
Of course, parliament would never...

320
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,850
My condolences, General Shaw.

321
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,320
I'm sorry?

322
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,980
It appears General Ogilvy hanged himself.

323
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,520
His adjunct will discover him in the washroom of his quarters tomorrow morning.

324
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,050
Tragic.

325
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,990
So, general, when can we expect to begin the Ottoman offensive?

326
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,360
Shall we say August?

327
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,210
Yes, sir.

328
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:10,790
August.

329
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:18,020
It is an interesting case, one which requires your particular talents.

330
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,410
What are your intentions?

331
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:25,560
Discover the one thing Mr. Alexander Grayson loves most in all the world.

332
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,780
Corrupt it. Deface it.

333
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,850
Obliterate it from this earth.

334
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,310
Is the Order aware of your intention?

335
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,440
They're aware that I'm investigating Mr. Grayson.

336
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,450
Please. Answer the question.

337
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,140
Well, you know as well as I that if they did,

338
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,200
I would be forced to explain my motivation.

339
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,940
You mean your son's recent suicide after the death of his lover?

340
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,840
Please, Miss Kleiberson.

341
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,560
I only wish to clarify the situation,

342
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,660
and that is thus...

343
00:28:54,580 --> 00:29:00,060
You wish to employ my services in order to execute an unsanctioned operation.

344
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,160
As I said before, not completely unsanctioned.

345
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,430
I understand.

346
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:15,700
May I then rely on your complete discretion in this matter so that I may engage another contractor?

347
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,310
That will not be necessary.

348
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,200
I have decided to accept the assignment.

349
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,520
Despite it being unsanctioned?

350
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,220
Because it is unsanctioned, I will require double my standard fee.

351
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,570
Plus expenses, of course.

352
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,920
Of course.

353
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,630
Mr. Harker?

354
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,300
If you want the real truth about Shaw, meet me.
Garriage yard tonight 900

355
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,430
It seems Her Ladyship wishes to see me tonight.

356
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,880
No details. How intriguing.

357
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,550
Sir, how long is Mr. Cervenka going to be our guest?

358
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,800
You heard me.

359
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,820
As long as he wishes.

360
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,410
Do you have any objections?

361
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,610
Oh, yes, quite a growing number of objections...

362
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,190
Chief among which is his lack of discretion

363
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,380
and complete absence of self-control.

364
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,020
You're right.

365
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,710
He can be impetuous.

366
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,420
But Josef has saved my life on the battlefield more times than I care to count.

367
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,030
He's like my brother, more than my brother.

368
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:05,700
His loyalty is absolute, and he will obey my orders.

369
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,830
Nevertheless, he has demonstrated that his obedience and loyalty fall

370
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,490
a distant second and third to his nature.

371
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,980
He cannot be domesticated, nor fully trusted.

372
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:18,960
Why?

373
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,360
He knows your true feelings toward Miss Murray, for one,

374
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,150
and their origins. I've sworn his silence.

375
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,910
A silence I'm sure he means to keep,

376
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,930
but only insofar as he's capable of keeping it.

377
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,440
It's not his loyalty that worries me.

378
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,780
I'm glad you came. These things are best done in person.

379
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,090
What things?

380
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,950
Well, I did enjoy our soiree last night,

381
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,360
and I do find your company, on occasion, most agreeable,

382
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,940
but I'm afraid I must terminate this relationship.

383
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,550
How distressingly predictable.

384
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,480
- Excuse me? - Never mind.

385
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,010
- I'll be on my way. - No, wait.

386
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,600
I'm curious.

387
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,710
- Exactly what is this predictability that you find so... - Distressing?

388
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,570
Well, not so much distressing as disappointing. Really?

389
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,690
The situation is clear, crystal clear, in fact.

390
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,400
- Must I go on? - Please do.

391
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,580
You're a woman who takes great pleasure in asserting her domination over men.

392
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,560
However, once you do, you very soon grow bored with them.

393
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,650
True enough. Go on.

394
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,670
Since we met, you've made every effort to do the same with me,

395
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:46,640
and in this, you have utterly failed.

396
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,150
This failure to dominate me has led to you being infatuated with me.

397
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,950
Such is the intensity of your emotions

398
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:57,870
that they threaten your sense of independence and control.

399
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:01,290
The only way to reassert this control is by terminating our relationship.

400
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,430
Oh, you do flatter yourself so.

401
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,280
Your vulnerability is evident by your withdrawal.

402
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,810
I call your actions cowardice. I call your ploys tedious.

403
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,580
You still assert that you feel nothing for me?

404
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,690
Nothing at all.

405
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,970
Follow me, sir.

406
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,210
- This way, sir. - Tonight's engagement?

407
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,330
I imagine so.

408
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,350
And does it give you great pleasure to see me here as he arrives?

409
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,500
The game, Mr. Grayson, requires at least three players.

410
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,220
Someday, madam,

411
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,130
you'll realize I was never playing.

412
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,950
The huntress made a fool of you.

413
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,060
You know nothing. I followed you.

414
00:33:55,430 --> 00:34:00,070
I heard every word. Who gave you permission to follow me?

415
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:03,970
I could smell her stink on you when you returned home last night.

416
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:10,970
I could never have believed you would consort with such a despicable creature.

417
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,990
Do you not understand?

418
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:19,110
We have a very complex strategy.

419
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:21,900
Some of our tactics are distasteful.

420
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,080
- Disgusting. - Perhaps.

421
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,100
But they are necessary if we are to emerge victorious.

422
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,140
We are playing a very dangerous and a very unforgiving game.

423
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,010
By seducing their huntress, I take her out of their game.

424
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,290
Ah, but not anymore

425
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,500
because there she is,

426
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,900
back on the board,

427
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,690
hunting us, killing us.

428
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,430
Do you not remember when we were the hunters

429
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,790
and they were the prey?

430
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:57,560
Why, you and I would harvest a hundred souls before breakfast.

431
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,570
Please, my liege.

432
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,180
I beseech thee. Let me kill her.

433
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,400
Make her scream.

434
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,540
Mr. Harker?

435
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,610
You sent me the note?

436
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:56,690
Peter Lang, formally Corporal Lang of Her Majesty's rifle brigade.

437
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,240
You have the truth I seek regarding Shaw?

438
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,690
I do. Cost you 10 bob to hear it.

439
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:18,720
I've got an address for you and a name,

440
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,210
a lady called Vera Markham.

441
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,240
Who is she to him? See for yourself.

442
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,070
Who is it?

443
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,390
Uh, my name's Jonathan Harker.

444
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,730
Yes?

445
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,360
I'm looking for Vera Markham.

446
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,690
I'm Vera Markham.

447
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,150
Oh, God. Oh, my God. I thought you were dead. I thought you were dead.

448
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,650
- Your heart... - There was a man.

449
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,130
No, no, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone.

450
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:26,050
He's gone. You scared him away.

451
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,440
Oh, God. Oh, you saved my life.

452
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,440
What were you doing in my bedroom in the first place?

453
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:47,600
I suffer from insomnia from time to time,

454
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,310
and it's my habit to take long, nighttime walks.

455
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:57,580
As of late, I find myself increasingly drawn to this street.

456
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,270
- The one we've been searching for? - I believe so.

457
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,500
So London is free again?

458
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,850
Excellent. Thank you, sir.

459
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,670
Your methods, though.

460
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,640
It was reckless, foolhardy, even, to lure such a creature into your home.

461
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,440
- There was every chance he... - There was no chance.

462
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,790
- But surely you must see... - There was no chance.

463
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,560
You would not have recognized her.

464
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,880
So contrite, so gentle, so shy.

465
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:22,380
I have sheared the tiger's claws. Just as you said you would, sir.

466
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,620
Although some doubted me.

467
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,100
She'll never see me now.

468
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,470
The Ordo Draco has lost its most dangerous weapon,

469
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,800
and it doesn't even know it.

470
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,780
And you were able to remove Josef in the process.

471
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,050
A masterstroke.

472
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,740
Yes.

473
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,200
- I'm sorry, sir. - Don't mention it.

474
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,830
Josef was a soldier.

475
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,850
He would have understood.

476
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,870
Sometimes, you have to sacrifice a knight to capture a queen.

477
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,870
Good-bye, Josef.

478
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,040
Tomorrow, we get back to work, Renfield.

479
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,810
We need that alloy for the resonator.

480
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,170
Yes, sir.

481
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,340
EMOIRE AND COLONIAL
METALLURGY

482
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,050
Ma'am, may I help you with that?

483
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,900
Wha...

484
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,450
Police business. He's a known criminal.

485
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,830
