00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- For crying out loud. - Thank you.

111
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hello? Check. That better? Great.

112
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everybody hear me? Up on the shelf, can you hear me? Great.

113
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. First item today:

114
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, yeah. Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

115
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - Moving buddy? You can't be serious.

116
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I didn't know we were supposed to have one already.

117
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do we have to hold hands?

118
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys think this is a big joke.

119
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We've only got one week left before the move.

120
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't want any toys left behind. A moving buddy.

121
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If you don't have one, get one!

122
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, #next. Oh, yes.

123
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tuesday night's plastic corrosion awareness meeting

124
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}was, I think, a big success.

125
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And we wanna thank Mr. Spell for putting that on for us.

126
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Thank you, Mr. Spell. - You're welcome.

127
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay. Oh, yes. One minor note here.

128
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andy's birthday party has been moved to today.

129
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait a minute here!

130
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What do you mean the party's today? His birthday's not 'til next week!

131
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's goin' on down there? Is his mom losin' her marbles?

132
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.

133
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm not worried. You shouldn't be worried.

134
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course Woody ain't worried. He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten.

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hey. Come on, Potato Head.

136
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If Woody says it's all right, then, well, darn it, it's good enough for me.

137
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woody has never steered us wrong before.

138
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, guys. Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.

139
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what if Andy gets another dinosaur, a mean one?

140
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,150
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just don't think I could take that kind of rejection!

141
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.

142
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is Andy we're talking about.

143
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It doesn't matter how much we're played with.

144
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.

145
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's what we're made for, right?

146
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff meeting, but... they're here!

147
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Birthday guests at three o'clock!

148
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stay calm, everyone!

149
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

150
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,510

151
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ho, boy! Will you take a look at all those presents?

152
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't see a thing.

153
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes, sir, we're next month's garage sale fodder for sure.

154
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Any dinosaur- shaped ones? - Oh, for crying out loud.

155
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- They're all in box. Es, you idiot. - They're getting bigger.

156
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Wait, there's a nice little one over there.

157
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hi!

158
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Spell: Trash can. - We're doomed!

159
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right! All right!

160
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?

161
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yes! Yes! We promise! - Okay! Save your batteries.

162
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Very good, Woody. That's using the old noodle.

163
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sergeant, establish a recon post downstairs. Code Red!

171
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone in the living room. It's almost time for the presents.

172
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, gangway, gangway.

173

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And this is how we find out

174
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}what is in those presents.

175
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, who's hungry?

176

180
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?

181

00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The impact must've awoken me from hypersleep.

259
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Terrain seems a bit unstable.

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere.

274
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you people still use fossil fuel, or have you discovered crystallic fusion?

275
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, let's see. We got double- A's.

277
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't shoot! It's okay. Friends.

278
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,700

00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Probably all copper wiring, huh?

290
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:24,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So, where you from? Singapore? Hong Kong?

00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not a laser! It's a... It's a little light bulb that blinks.

305

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not a Space Ranger!

315
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He doesn't fight evil or, or shoot lasers or fly!

319
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They are a terillium- carbonic alloy, and I can fly.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That wasn't flying! That was... falling with style.

331
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man, the dolls must really go for you. Can you teach me that?

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, I can't bear to watch one of these again.

422
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.

423
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's going on?

424
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Nothing that concerns you spacemen, just us toys.

425
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'd better take a look anyway.

426
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why is that soldier strapped to an ex. Plosive device?

427
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's why: Sid.

428
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sure is a hairy fellow.

429
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, that's Scud, you idiot.

430
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That is Sid.

431
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You mean that happy child? - That ain't no happy child.

432
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:23,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He tortures toys, just for fun!

433
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, then we've got to do something.

434
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doing? Get down from there!

435
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson. - Yeah, sure. You go ahead.

436
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Melt him with your scary laser.

437
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Be careful with that! It's extremely dangerous.

438
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's lighting it! He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!

439
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look out!

440
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes! He's gone! He's history!

441
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I could've stopped him.

442
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz, I would love to see you try.

443
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Of course, I'd love to see you as a crater.

444
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:04,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The sooner we move, the better.

445
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah!

446
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,920


447
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}To infinity and beyond!

448
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All this packing makes me hungry.

449
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What would you say to dinner at, oh, Pizza Planet?

450
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!

451
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go wash your hands, and I'll get Molly ready.

452
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can I bring some toys? - You can bring one toy.

453
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Just one? - One toy?

454
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will Andy pick me?

455
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,850


456
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Don't count on it"?

457
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz! Oh, Buzz! Buzz Lightyear.

458
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,450
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness. We've got trouble!

459
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Trouble? Where? - Down there. Just down there.

460
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A helpless toy, it's... it's trapped, Buzz!

461
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then we've no time to lose.

462
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't see anything!

463
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, he's there! Just, just keep looking!

464
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What kind of toy...

465
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz!

466
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,330
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't see him in the driveway.

467
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:59,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I think he bounced into Sid's yard! - Oh! Buzz!

468
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to say something. What is it, boy?

469
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He's saying that this was no accident. - What do you mean?

470
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I mean Humpty- Dumpty was pushed... - No!

471
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}...by Woody!

472
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - Wait a minute.

473
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you?

474
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Potato Head?

475
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back- stabbing murderer!

476
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, it was an accident, guys.

477
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Now, you, you gotta believe me.

478
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We believe ya, Woody. Right, Rex?

479
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, ye... N... I don't like confrontations!

480
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,230
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where is your honor, dirt bag? You are an absolute disgrace!

481
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You don't deserve to... Hey!

482
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You couldn't handle Buzz cutting in on your playtime, could you, Woody?

483
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:46,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favorite toy.

484
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you got rid of him.

485
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, what if Andy starts playing with me more, Woody, huh?

486
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You gonna knock me outta the window too?

487
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't think we should give him the chance.

488
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There he is, men. Frag him!

489
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's string him up by his pull string!

490
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I got dibs on his hat! - Would you boys stop it!

491
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tackle him!

492
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no, no! Wait! I can ex. Plain everything!

493
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, Mom, be right down. I've gotta get Buzz.

494
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Retreat!

495
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:16,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, do you know where Buzz is?

496
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, I haven't seen him.

497
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:23,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Andy, I'm heading out the door! - But, Mom, I can't find him!

498
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, just grab some other toy. Now, come on!

499
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,920
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, okay.

500
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I couldn't find my Buzz. I know I left him right there.

501
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:40,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.

502
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's too short! We need more monkeys!

503
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,790
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There aren't any more! That's the whole barrel!

504
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz, the monkeys aren't working!

505
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We're formulating another plan! Stay calm!

506
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, where could he be?

507
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,330


508
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,270


509
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Can I help pump the gas? - Sure! I'll even let you drive.

510
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah? - Yeah, when you're 16.

511
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Funny, Mom.

512
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:33,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident?

513
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz!

514
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:42,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz! Ha! You're alive!

515
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:45,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is great! Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved.

516
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andy'll find you here, he'll take us back to the room

517
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:53,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake.

518
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh? Right? Buddy?

519
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:00,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me,

520
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.

521
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh. Well, that's good. - But we're not on my planet, are we?

522
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,190
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No.

523
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Okay, come on!

524
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You want a piece of me?

525
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}#Buzz Buzz Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.#

526

529
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm lost!

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm a lost toy!

536
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}This is the perfect time to panic. I'm lost. Andy is gone.

537
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're gonna move from their house in two days, and it's all your fault!

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't talk to me about importance!

543
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy!

00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:06,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness.

554
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity.

{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah, man. Can you help me? - Pizza Planet? Andy!

560
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Do you know where Cutting Boulevard is?

561
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no!

00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't show my face in that room without Buzz.

563
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Buzz! Buzz, come back! - Go away!

564
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,390
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! Buzz, you gotta come back! I...

565

00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I found a spaceship!

567
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's a spaceship, Buzz!

568
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on, man, hurry up! Like, the pizzas are getting cold here!

569
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Cutting Boulevard, huh? - Yeah, yeah. Which way?

570
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now, you're sure this space freighter will return to its port of origin

571
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}once it jettisons its food supply?

00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:20,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you home.

573
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Well, then, let's climb aboard. - No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz!

574
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's get in the back. No one will see us there.

575
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.

00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:00,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The claw chooses who will go and who will stay.

635
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:03,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is ludicrous. - Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?

636
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Take that!

637
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no! Sid!

638
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get down!

639
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,280


640
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What's gotten into you? I was...

641
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,820
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are the one that decided to climb into this...

642
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:20,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The claw, it moves.

643
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I have been chosen!

644
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Farewell, my friends. I go on to a better place.

645
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Gotcha!

646
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A Buzz Lightyear? No way!

647
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,250
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes!

648
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz! No!

649
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey!

650
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,290
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He has been chosen!

651
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- He must go. - Hey!

652
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you doing? - Do not fight the claw.

653
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Stop it! Stop it, you zealots!

654
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:15,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right! Double prizes!

655
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,610
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Let's go home and... play.

656
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,170
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sheriff, I can see your dwelling from here.

657
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,100
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- You're almost home. - Nirvana is coming.

658
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- The mystic portal awaits. - Will you be quiet?

659
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You guys don't get it, do you?

660
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Once we go into Sid's house, we won't be coming out.

661
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy!

662
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sit! Good boy.

663
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Hey, I got something for you, boy. - Freeze!

664
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ready, set, now!

665
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hannah! Hey, Hannah!

666
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,360
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What? - Did I get my package in the mail?

667
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know?

668
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't know!

669
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, no, Hannah! Look, janie! - What? Hey!

670
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- She's sick! - No, she's not!

671
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,500
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'll have to perform one of my operations.

672
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No! - No, not Sid's room. Not there.

673
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,370
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, give her back!

674
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,850
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sid! Sid!

675
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no, we have a sick patient here, nurse.

676
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Prepare the OR, stat!

677
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Patient is... prepped.

678
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No one's ever attempted a double bypass brain transplant before.

679
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now for the tricky part. Pliers!

680
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school.

681
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,810
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Doctor, you've done it!

682
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:52,870


683
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hannah!

684
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Janie's all better now.

685
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,420
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Mom! Mom! - She's lying!

686
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:04,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whatever she says, it's not true!

687
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:11,230


688
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,100


689
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We are gonna die. I'm outta here!

690
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Locked.

691
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's gotta be another way outta here.

692
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz? Was that you?

693
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,030
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, hi there, little fella.

694
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:57,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come out here. Do you know a way outta here?

695
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:28,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz!

696
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,880
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're cannibals.

697
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,320
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mayday, mayday.

698
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come in, Star Command. Send reinforcements.

699
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Star Command, do you copy?

700
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I've set my laser from stun to kill.

701
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:59,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Great. Great. Yeah, and if anyone attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.

702
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, you guys, I think I found him!

703
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz, is that you?

704
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whiskers, will you get outta here!

705
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You're interfering with the search and rescue!

706
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,580
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, they're home.

707
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Mom, have you seen Woody?

708
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Where was the last place you left him? - Right here in the van.

709
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,900
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, I'm sure he's there. You're just not looking hard enough.

710
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:30,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's not here, Mom. Woody's gone.

711
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:33,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Woody's gone?

712
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away.

713
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Huh? Huh? I told you he was guilty.

714
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,310
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?

715
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,210
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay.

716
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, a survivor. Where's the rebel base? Talk!

717
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,400
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can see your will is strong.

718
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Well, we have ways of making you talk.

719
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:17,550
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Where are your rebel friends now?

720
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!

721
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,590
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right!

722
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Are you all right? I'm proud of you, Sheriff.

723
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:38,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}A lesser man would've talked under such torture.

724
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I sure hope this isn't permanent.

725
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:44,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the space port.

726
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}The door. It's open! We're free!

727
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Woody, we don't know what's out there! - I'll tell you wha...

728
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,680
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}They're gonna eat us, Buzz! Do something quick!

729
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Shield your eyes.

730
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,760
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's not working. I recharged it before I left. It should be good for...

731
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:05,270
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You idiot! You're a toy! Use your karate chop action!

732
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Get away! - Hey! Hey! How're you doin' that?

733
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:10,890
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Stop that. - Back! Back, you savages! Back!

734
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:14,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Woody, stop it! - Sorry, guys, but dinner's canceled!

735
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,070
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no place like home! There's no place like home!

736
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,950
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}There's no place like home.

737
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,960
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Another stunt like that, cowboy, you're gonna get us killed.

738
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:39,860
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Don't tell me what to do.

739
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:01,480
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}#Yee- haw! Giddyap pardner!#

00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}That's very funny, Buzz.

845
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,640
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- This is serious! - Hey, Woody! Where'd ya go?

846
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He's lying. Buzz ain't there.

847
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,980
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh! Hi, Buzz!

848
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:46,180
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why don't you say hello to the guys over there?

849
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:49,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hiya, fellas! To infinity and beyond!

850
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, look! It's Buzz!

851
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:56,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys our new secret best friends handshake.

852
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:58,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Give me five, man!

853
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Something's screwy here.

854
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}So you see we're friends now, guys. Aren't we, Buzz?

855
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:04,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You bet. Give me a hug.

856
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Boy, I love you too.

857
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:08,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}See? It is Buzz.

858
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:11,740
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Now give back the lights, Potato Head. - Wait just a minute.

859
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What are you tryin' to pull? - Nothing!

860
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:20,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Oh, that is disgusting. - Murderer!

861
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:23,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- No! No, no, no, no, no! - You murdering dog!

862
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,460
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- It's not what you think. I swear! - Save it for the jury.

863
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:27,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I hope Sid pulls your voice box. Out, ya creep.

864
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,060
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, no! No, no! Don't leave! Don't leave!

865
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Ya gotta help us, please! You don't know what it's like over here!

866
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,630
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come on. Let's get outta here.

867
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:37,200
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Go back to your lives, citizens. Show's over.

868
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,300
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Come back! Slink!

869
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:43,710

870
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:47,080
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No! No! Come back!

871
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:50,140
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Slinky!

872
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,090
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz! Go away!

873
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:02,720
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You disgusting freaks!

874
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:06,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All right, back! Back, you cannibals!

875
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:15,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}He is still alive, and you're not gonna get him, you monsters!

876
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:16,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}What are you doin'?

877
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,440
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Hey, they fix. Ed you.

878
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:26,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But they're cannibals.

879
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:30,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}We saw them eat those other toys.

880
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:40,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sorry. I thought that you were gonna...

881
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You know, you know, eat my friend.

882
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, no, no, wait, hey!

883
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,840
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- What's wrong? - Sid?

884
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,240
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Not now, Mom! I'm busy!

885
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:51,040
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Sid! Buzz, come on! - You left that door open.

886
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:56,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Get up! Use your legs! Fine! Let Sid trash you! But don't blame me!

887
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It came! It finally came!

888
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:05,830
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"The Big One."

889
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:10,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}"Extremely dangerous.

890
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:13,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Keep out of reach of children."

891
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:18,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Cool! What am I gonna blow?

892
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:21,910
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Man. Hey, where's that wimpy cowboy doll?

893
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,730
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Yes. I've always wanted to put a spaceman into orbit.

894
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:52,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Now. Yes.

895
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,650
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, no!

896
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,020
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, man!

897
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:11,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sid Phillips reporting.

898
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Launch of the shuttle has been delayed

899
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:16,570
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}due to adverse weather conditions at the launch site.

900
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Tomorrow's forecast: Sunny.

901
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,470
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Sweet dreams.

902
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:31,620
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.

903
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:33,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But what if we leave them behind?

904
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,410
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, don't worry, honey.

905
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:38,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.

906
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,390


907
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,430
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I need air!

908
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,770
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Will you quit movin' around?

909
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,540
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm sorry. It's just that I get... I get so nervous before I travel.

910
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:57,130
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}How did I get stuck with you as a moving buddy?

911
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:00,010
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Everyone else was picked.

912
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,940
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Woody.

913
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:12,120
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}If only you could see how much Andy misses you.

914
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:27,560
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey, Buzz!

915
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,050
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Hey. Get over here and see if you can get this toolbox. Off me.

916
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:43,780
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, come on, Buzz, I...

917
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:48,160
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Buzz, I can't do this without you. I need your help.

918
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:52,600
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I can't help. I can't help anyone.

919
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,930
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why, sure you can, Buzz. You can get me outta here.

920
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.

921
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Andy's house, Sid's house. What's the difference?

922
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:06,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Oh, Buzz. You've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.

923
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:10,110
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}No, Woody. For the first time I am thinking clearly.

924
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:13,750
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You were right all along. I'm not a Space Ranger.

925
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:17,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm just a toy, a stupid, little, insignificant toy.

926
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:19,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Whoa, hey, wait a minute.

927
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,490
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Bein' a toy is a lot better than bein' a, a Space Ranger.

928
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,530
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}- Yeah, right. - No, it is.

929
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,260
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest.

930
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:30,800
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}And it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal.

931
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:34,670
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}It's because you're a toy. You are his toy.

932
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,870
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}But why would Andy want me?

933
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:41,380
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would Andy want you? Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear.

934
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:44,510
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.

935
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:48,220
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You've got wings. You glow in the dark. You talk!

936
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:51,660
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Your helmet does that, that, that whoosh thing.

937
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:55,990
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}You are a cool toy.

938
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:01,700
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}As a matter of fact, you're too cool.

939
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:04,970
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I mean, I mean, what chance does a toy like me have

940
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,340
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}against a Buzz Lightyear action figure?

941
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:11,000
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}All I can do is...

942
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:15,520
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}#There's a snake in my boots.#

943
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,710
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}Why would Andy ever want to play with me

944
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:20,690
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}when he's got you?

945
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:25,280
{\fncambria\fs22\shad2\1c&H45DFEC&\b0\i1}I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket.

946
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,400


947
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:51,080
