3
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,562
我绝不找借口
I'm not gonna make excuses.

4
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,690
所有的一切
I asked for this.

5
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,885
皆我所自愿
All of it.

6
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,645
因为我想出人头地
And I did it to become s omeone else.

7
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,844
我渴求更多
I wanted more.

8
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,127
我们这一代人
We belong to a generation

9
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:38,242
是看着我们的未来被偷去的一代
that watched our future get stolen out from under us.

10
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,090
父辈所崇尚的美国梦已经被那些…
The American Dream our parents knew has been hijacked by men

11
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,564
既得利益者坑蒙拐骗
who are willing to lie, cheat and steal to protect their wealth.

12
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,476
曾经只需学习好
Used to be if you got good grades,

13
00:01:51,476 --> 00:01:53,325
便可以进好学校
you got into the right school,

14
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,970
找一份不错的工作
got the right job.

15
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,124
再辛苦工作15年
And after 15 years of hard work,

16
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,009
某个一官半职
you get your name on the door.

17
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,089
但这样的世界已不复存在
But that world is gone.

18
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,205
人们总是告诫你美梦易破
People always tell you be careful what you wish for.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,445
我从不相信他们
I never believed them.

20
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,731
对岸的灯火总是更亮
The lights always looked brighter across the river.

21
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:23,167
片名：偏执

22
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,004
快下来
Hey, come on!

23
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,804
我来了 切尔
Hey, I'm coming. Chill.

24
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,204
要付额外的钱吗？
I'm paying extra for that?

25
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,283
别担心 免费的医保 斯科特
Don't worry, it's covered, Scout.

26
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,046
- 没有免费的午餐 老爸  - 你去哪？
- Nothing's covered, Dad. - Where you going?

27
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,326
我和凯文去俱乐部
I'm going to the club with Kev.

28
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,682
- 谁？  - 你又不认识他？
- Which one? - Why? You think you might know it?

29
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,004
我小年轻的时候可是迪厅名角
Well, I have been known to frequent discotheques in my heyday.

30
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,891
现在不兴这种叫法 但你挺行啊
They don't call them that anymore, but that's good.

31
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,816
别让他吸烟
Hey, don't let him smoke.

32
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:31,042
他常把烟藏靠垫下
He hides cigars under that cushion there.

33
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,964
别吸了
Don't smoke!

34
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,929
怎么了 你嫉妒啊？
What's the matter? You jealous?

35
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,401
你猜对了
Oh, yes.

36
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,924
去RISE俱乐部 你怎么这么久？
Club Rise, baby. What took you so long?

37
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,121
帮个忙让我们进去
Why don't you do yourself a favor and lift the rope?

38
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,647
关我什么事？
And how is that doing me a favor?

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,086
算是投资好了
Consider it an investment.

40
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,083
周一我俩会挣到足够的钱
Come Monday, my boy and I will be making so much money,

41
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,471
到时候你准得求我们
you'll be begging us to come back

42
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,811
帮你完成月营业计划
to this flavor of the month of yours.

43
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,080
潮人禁止 处男禁止
Look, no hipsters and no virgins.

44
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,004
处男？
Virgin?

45
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,686
他不是处男  我刚看到他劈腿了
He's not a virgin. I just watched him get laid outside.

46
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,808
亲眼所见 绝对的大劈腿
I watched it, I literally saw him get laid.

47
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,928
- 亚当 走吧  - 亲眼所见
- Adam, come on. - I saw him with my own eyes.

48
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,969
我会回来的
I'm going to be back.

49
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,086
你很紧张？
Are you nervous yet?

50
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,647
你紧张什么？
Nervous? About what?

51
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,250
周一得把产品展示给怪胎尼古拉斯·怀特
On Monday we pitch our product to Nicolas freaking Wyatt,

52
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:26,964
所以嘛
that's what.

53
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,471
凯文 我们已经为此忙活了4个月
Kevin, we've been working on that pitch for four months.

54
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:31,126
这件天才产品
It's genius.

55
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,520
我唯一担心的是
The only thing I'm worried about is

56
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,251
如果我们没有因此被提职 怀特会炒谁的鱿鱼
who Wyatt's gonna fire for not promoting us sooner.

57
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,127
有能力付账单真开心
How great is it gonna be to pay our bills

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,123
还要大吃大喝
and eat in the same month?

59
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,089
准备过好日子吧
Oh, get ready 'cause it's happening.

60
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,718
每次你一预言
You always say it's happening,

61
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,483
我就得付出租车费
and then I end up paying for the cab.

62
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,842
这次不同
This time's different.

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,810
将会改变我们的一生
This pitch, it's gonna change our lives.

64
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,686
发誓
Promise you.

65
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,729
总之还是得我付车费吧？
But I'm still paying for the cab, right?

66
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,484
- 对  - 就知道
- Yeah. - Got you.

67
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,450
不是我的
It's not me.

68
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,402
喂
Hello?

69
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,284
我马上到
Yeah, I'll be right there.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,942
能拐一下吗？
Sir, can you turn around?

71
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:26,321
去圣爵士医院
We need to go to Saint Joe's Hospital.

72
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,843
亚当 他好得很
Adam, he's doing great.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,526
还是老毛病 对面那间
He's up to his old tricks. He's right through there.

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,446
我们帮他疏通了积液 行了
We cleared out the mucus, and he's fine.

75
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,443
但他需要更多的吸氧
But he must use the oxygen more,

76
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,206
一旦栓塞 立刻叫医生
and he has to call us at the onset of congestion.

77
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,842
- 他知道的  - 如他所愿吧
- Yeah, he knows. - Wants to do it his own way, huh?

78
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,201
对
Yeah.

79
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,204
- 你可以带他回家了  - 好的 谢谢
- You can take him home. - All right. Thanks.

80
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,170
你看 坎西迪先生
As you can see, Mr. Cassidy,

81
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,166
最后两个疗程不在保险范围内
the last two procedures were not covered by insurance.

82
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,528
你意思我需要额外付钱？
What do you mean? I have extended coverage.

83
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,330
说的没错 怀特公司已停止支付了
You did. Wyatt Corp terminated it.

84
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,204
他们不应该那么做 这是我应得的福利
They can't do that. I have it. I need to have it.

85
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,169
很不幸 他们有这个权利
Unfortunately, they can.

86
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,164
现在很多公司都这么削减开支
A lot of our companies are doing it now, cutbacks.

87
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,247
我连40块都没有
I don't have 40 grand.

88
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,768
我们可以为您设计一套还款计划或医疗贷款
We can help with a payment plan, or a medical loan.

89
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,370
真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

90
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,364
没关系 我想别的办法吧
Yeah. I'll figure something out.

91
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:45,357
（基于约瑟夫方德同名小说改编）

92
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,441
我们已经尽力 请理解
We did everything we could.

93
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,688
我们为怀特公司卖命
We work for Wyatt Corp,

94
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,241
世界顶级科技公司之一
one of the top tech companies on the planet.

95
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,364
初入茅庐的我们决心一展宏图
When they hired us, we were going to take over the world.

96
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,643
六年过去了 我们还是原地踏步
Six years in, we were still just lowly cubicle drones,

97
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,531
眼巴巴看着高层们捞足油水…
watching our bosses take home obscene bonuses...

98
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,402
…我们只拿可怜的底薪
...while we were stuck with entry-level salaries.

99
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,170
太久了 也该轮到我们了
We'd waited long enough. It was our turn.

100
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,402
是金子终于会闪光
Our time to shine.

101
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,601
你还好吗
You all right?

102
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,924
很好 我们去搞定他
Yeah. We're gonna kill it.

103
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,490
如果事情要黄
Yeah, well, if things go south,

104
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,449
也得冷静 对吗？
just stay cool. All right?

105
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,287
好的
Yeah.

106
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,891
怀特先生准备好了
Mr. Wyatt is ready.

107
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,445
冷静
Stay cool.

108
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,446
早上好
Good morning.

109
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,569
我们一直致力于沟通研究
We are all in the business of connecting people.

110
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,245
水不够热
This water's not hot enough.

111
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,724
抱歉 怀特先生 我来处理
I'm sorry, Mr. Wyatt. I'll take care of it.

112
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,646
需要再加热一下
It should be boiling.

113
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,368
喔… 我们一直致力于沟通研究
Uh... We're in the business of connecting people.

114
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,244
这句你说过了
You already said that.

115
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,531
是 这就是我们的客户所需求的
Right. That's what our customers have always wanted.

116
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:29,486
保持即时联络
To stay connected.

117
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,147
他们更多地使用键盘交谈
Those same customers are now texting

118
00:08:31,147 --> 00:08:32,166
而不是面对面
more than they're talking

119
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,691
花在微博的时间超过了面谈
and tweeting more than they're meeting.

120
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,207
哪个环节出错了 我们有没有疏忽？
So, what's changed? What are we missing?

121
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,966
关键在于人们并不需要随时保持联络
We don't want to be connected anymore.

122
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,128
只希望在孤独的时候才联络
We just want to feel connected while we isolate.

123
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,487
因此…假如
So, what if...

124
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,364
…一个4寸的手机有个60寸的屏幕？
...a four-inch mobile had a 60-inch screen?

125
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,208
那就不是手机了
Well, then it wouldn't be mobile.

126
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,199
使用语音激活
With a voice-activated pairing device,

127
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:55,284
Ethion将可以…
Ethion will allow users

128
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,364
把手机屏幕广播到家中任意显示器上
to broadcast their mobile across any monitor in the home.

129
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,521
联机
Pick up.

130
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,522
Ethion 3.0 世界在你眼前
Ethion 3.0 gives you the power to bring your world to you.

131
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,682
他在向我推销软件？
Is he pitching me software?

132
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,579
先生 这个绝佳的机会在于:
Sir, we see a unique opportunity

133
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:11,726
Ethion可以运行在任何普通手机上…
to take Ethion from a run-of-the-mill phone...

134
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,614
这有悖于我们的品牌战略
This is a re-branding meeting.

135
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:14,929
说说疏忽吧？
Where's the disconnect?

136
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,281
先生 我认为疏忽在你与客户之间
Well, sir, I believe the disconnect is between you and the consumers.

137
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,087
你雇我们肯定不是为看你沏茶的吧？
You didn't hire us to sit around and watch you make tea, did you?

138
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,408
说说我为什么要雇你
Tell me, why did I hire you?

139
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,403
因为我们知道年轻人要什么
Because we know what a younger generation wants.

140
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,527
要什么？
Which is?

141
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,643
要的不是一部外表崭新的手机
A phone that doesn't just look new a phone that is new,

142
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,690
而是一部可以改变生活方式的手机
a phone that changes the way we live.

143
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,446
没错 我和你们年轻一代有代沟
You know, you're right. I have lost touch with your generation.

144
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,806
对不起忘了你叫什么名字
What was your name again?

145
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,450
亚当·坎西迪
I'm Adam Cassidy.

146
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,806
多大？
How old are you?

147
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,405
27岁
Twenty-seven.

148
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,244
我比你年轻两岁的时候
When I was two years younger than you are now,

149
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,085
已经开始摆弄数字蜂窝技术
I was pioneering digital cellular technology

150
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,204
而我同学们还在摆弄电子脉冲
while my colleagues were still pissing around with electronic pulses.

151
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,646
我有远见
I had vision.

152
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,521
但是你只有科技想象力
But you have all the technological advantage imaginable

153
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,967
你带给我的是什么？
and what do you bring me?

154
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,885
在电视上进行网络社交？
Social networking on a television.

155
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,487
下一个！ 理查德·麦卡利斯特
Next! Bring in Richard McAllister.

156
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,011
抱歉了 哥们
I'm sorry, guys.

157
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,606
你让我们像傻子一样矗着
You just left us standing there looking like idiots.

158
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,842
你脑子里到底想什么？
I mean, what were you thinking?

159
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,480
我们都力挺这个点子
We all backed the idea.

160
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,976
点子不是问题
Our idea wasn't the problem.

161
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,202
我揶揄了他 都看到他脸色了吧
I railroaded him. You saw his face.

162
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,603
领队发疯 与上帝作对就是这个下场
That's what happens when your team leader goes rogue and argues with God.

163
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,369
看来我们不会继续共事了
Well, uh... I guess now that we're not working together

164
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,488
这样我们就可以发展床上恋情了吧？
we can start sleeping together, right?

165
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,682
我真心希望你在开玩笑
I seriously hope you're not talking to me.

166
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,763
我们会找到新工作的吧？
We'll find new jobs, right?

167
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,684
我们不是离职的 是被解雇的
We weren't laid off, Chels. We were fired.

168
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,491
你准备在简历上怎么解释？
How are you going to explain that on your resume?

169
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,967
知道么？
You know what?

170
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:17,681
至少我可以请大家先喝一杯
The least I can do is buy you guys a few drinks.

171
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,524
用开发基金帐户？真的吗？
Our discretionary account? Really?

172
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,185
亚当 不要
Adam, no.

173
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:22,968
如果公司一旦发现我们还继续花钱…
If Wyatt ever found out that we spent any more money...

174
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,400
再坏还能怎么坏？ 再解雇我们一次？
What are they going to do? Fire us?

175
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,990
钱本来就是让我们见机行事的
The money was ours to spend as we see fit.

176
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,121
去RISE俱乐部
We're going to Rise.

177
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,362
- 我们进不去  - 我们可以
- We can't get in there. - Yes, we can.

178
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,649
- 我们可以  - 劝劝那家伙吧
- Yes, we can. - Try and stop the guy.

179
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,724
我们要去RISE
宝贝！ 太棒了！
We're going to Rise, baby! Oh, yeah!

180
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,201
伙计 这简直太酷了
Dude, you realize this is going to be so awesome.

181
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,129
- 我们要一醉方休  - 如何？
- We're going to pop ten bottles. - Think so?

182
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,408
我讨厌那条看门狗
I hate this doorman.

183
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,691
亚当·坎西迪 说了我会回来的
Adam Cassidy. Told you I'd be back.

184
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,370
你们的桌子在这边 先生
Your table's right this way, sir.

185
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,409
太好了！
Yeah!

186
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,370
太棒了
Yeah!

187
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,170
- 干！  - 干！
- Shots! - Shots!

188
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,845
- 干！  - 上帝啊
- Shots! - Oh my God.

189
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,898
今晚还不走运
if you guys don't get lucky tonight,

190
00:12:20,898 --> 00:12:22,051
以后就别想了
it's never going to happen.

191
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,043
我负责倒酒 你要来一份吗？
I'm fielding offers. You want in?

192
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,321
待会见
See me after.

193
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,480
干杯 伙计们！
Cheers, guys!

194
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,121
亚当 桌上的酒快没了
Adam, maybe we should close out the tab.

195
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,601
别担心
Hey, don't worry about it, man, don't worry about it.

196
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,330
我们能再来一瓶诗珞珂吗？
(全球百大高档烈酒品牌)
Hey, can we get another bottle of Ciroc?

197
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,726
- 绕着我跳！  - 不 不 不
- Twirl me! - No, no, no.

198
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,607
来吧！
Come on!

199
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,371
伙计 你去哪儿
Hey, buddy, where you going?

200
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,528
走桃花运了
Could be love.

201
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,521
醒醒
Wake up.

202
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,728
醒醒
Hey, wake up.

203
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,287
我得走了
I have to go.

204
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,885
你也该走了
So do you.

205
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,886
没早餐吗？
No breakfast?

206
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,646
我做错什么了吗？
Did I, uh, do something wrong?

207
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,711
要是你做错了
If you had done something wrong,

208
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,566
你不可能还在这里
you wouldn't be here, would you?

209
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,963
那么…
So...

210
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,282
那么 我们…
So, uh, we...

211
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,681
…走吧
...are leaving.

212
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,326
等一下 我都不知道你叫什么
Wait a second, I don't even know your name.

213
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,406
你是要走消防梯吗？
Are you taking the fire escape?

214
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,126
好的
OK.

215
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,362
- 谢谢  - 不客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

216
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,764
清咖还是加糖奶咖？
Hey. Black, or cream and sugar?

217
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,942
你跟踪我？
You stalking me now?

218
00:15:17,942 --> 00:15:19,366
我只是想问问你叫什么
I just want to know your name.

219
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,882
你泡我 向我示好就是了电话号码？
Why? So you can poke me, friend me, ask for my number?

220
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,327
是的 给一个联系方式吧
Or you could just give me your number.

221
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,766
你不是我的菜
You're not relationship material.

222
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,445
菜？你想要长久关系？
Relationship? You're looking for a relationship?

223
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,284
我喜欢长久关系 我很在行
I love relationships. I'm great at relationships.

224
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,404
不 实际上我只想赶紧甩掉你
No. Actually, I'm just trying to get rid of you nicely.

225
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,884
我们炒饭了吗？
Didn't we have sex?

226
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,564
我喝醉的时候更中意桥那边的人
I have a thing for bridge-and-tunnel guys when I drink.

227
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,927
你刚才叫我桥那边的人？
Did you just call me bridge-and-tunnel?

228
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,325
你带我去吃芝士薯条
You took me out for cheese fries.

229
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,801
芝士薯条！
Cheese fries!

230
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,166
然后呢？
Oh. Then what?

231
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,641
然后一夜情呗
Then you had the night of your life.

232
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,251
你的原话
Your words, not mine.

233
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,926
清咖
Oh... Black.

234
00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:07,949
（16条未读短信）

235
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,971
亚当·坎西迪？我是迈尔斯·米彻姆

236
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,083
怀特先生想和你聊聊
Mr. Wyatt would like to speak with you.

237
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,250
你怎么知道我在这里？
How did you know where I was?

238
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,207
我都不住这附近的
I mean, I don't even live around here.

239
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,050
坎西迪先生
Mr. Cassidy.

240
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,084
自称比我还了解我生意的人
The man who claims he knows my business better than I do.

241
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,765
请坐吧
Here, take a seat.

242
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,130
- 来杯葡萄酒？  - 不
- Drop of vino? - Uh... No.

243
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,205
看来你是我们帐务漏洞的受益者
It seems you were the beneficiary of an accounting error we made.

244
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,051
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

245
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,009
Ethion开发基金帐户
The Ethion discretionary fund.

246
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,886
我的钱用在哪里了？
Where's my money?

247
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,122
用于市场研究调研报告
We used it on market research.

248
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,726
调研RISE俱乐部？
At Club Rise?

249
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,370
1万6千美元？
Sixteen grand?

250
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,683
看来这份调研报告必然很详尽
It must be a very detailed report.

251
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,881
你认为你能侥幸成功么？
You think you can rip me off and get away with it?

252
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,411
信用卡诈骗
Credit card fraud?

253
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,642
不 对不起 我会还回来的
No, sir, I'm sorry. I'm gonna pay you back.

254
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,043
不行 这又不是贷款
No you won't. It wasn't a loan.

255
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,931
给你两条路
Now there's two ways we can play this.

256
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,481
做马还是做狗？
Are you a horse or a dog?

257
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,769
马是恐惧被鞭笞而飞奔
A horse is motivated by fear. He's running from the whip.

258
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,922
这鞭子就是信用卡诈骗
The whip here being felony fraud.

259
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,686
- 他是狗  - 狗是被饥饿而驱使
- He's a dog. - A dog is motivated by hunger.

260
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,922
他追踪兔子作为下一顿美食
He's chasing the rabbit, his next meal.

261
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,765
你在布鲁克林低收入家庭长大
You were raised in a low-income home in Brooklyn.

262
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,127
七岁的时候妈妈死了

263
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,726
税务显示你还要赡养老父
Your W-2 says you now support your father.

264
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,927
那？
30?

265
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,048
那意味着你每天都要翻过跨海大桥
So, it means you came across that bridge every day

266
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,605
渴望成功
hungry to succeed.

267
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,922
- 人都想成功  - 但并非人人可以像我们这样
- Everyone wants to succeed. - Yeah, but not like us.

268
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,289
你父亲做了32年保安
Your father spent 32 years as a security guard.

269
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,807
- 那行业能有什么雄心壮志？  - 这到底在干嘛？
- Where's the ambition in that? - What's this about?

270
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,162
你渴求更多！
You want more out of life!

271
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,211
我曾经和你一样 只不过来自不同的街区
I grew up like you. I mean, different streets.

272
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,807
怀着相同的梦 但没人会替我实现 没人
Same dream, but nobody gave it to me. No one.

273
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,203
我说我能让你发财如何 ？
And what if I told you I could make you rich?

274
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,169
让你朋友们重新获得工作？
And give your friends their jobs back?

275
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,082
你昨天展示了一个绝佳的创意
That was a smart pitch you gave yesterday.

276
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,410
我从艾康公司起家
I started out at Eikon.

277
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,327
乔克·戈达是我的师傅
Jock Goddard was my mentor.

278
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,209
你知道他吗
Do you know him?

279
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,169
是的 我当然知道
Yeah, of course I know him.

280
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,527
我的毕业论文是半导体内存研究
I did my graduate thesis on semi-conductor memory.

281
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,002
当时戈达要求手机不超过砖块大小
Goddard's basically the reason cell phones aren't the size of bricks.

282
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,127
他创建了艾康公司
He founded Eikon.

283
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,169
并最终成功上市
And built it into the largest publicly traded

284
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,890
成为全世界最大的科技公司
technology company in the world.

285
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,690
自从我独立门户后
And ever since I left, he has spent

286
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,008
他无时不刻不想摧毁我
every waking moment trying to destroy me.

287
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,960
艾康公司马上要发布一款力挽狂澜的新智能手机
Eikon has a new smartphone coming that's said to be a game-changer.

288
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,770
代号Occura
They're calling it Occura.

289
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,446
你要去艾康公司工作
You are going to work for Eikon.

290
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,120
- 什么？  - 帮我们得到想要的 你可得50万
- What? - Get us in the door, you get 500K.

291
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,851
成功之后 你会得到100万股权
Get us what we need, you'll see another million in stock options.

292
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,001
那笔数目
Money like that

293
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,003
足以让你安心照顾你父亲
would allow you to take care of your father and a whole lot more.

294
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,242
艾康公司不会雇佣我的
Eikon's not just going to hire me.

295
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,920
他们会 我们已经安排妥当
They will when we're done with you.

296
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,689
窃取商业机密是违法的
This is illegal. It's stealing trade secrets.

297
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,889
这就是你一直在等待的机会
This is the opportunity you have been waiting for.

298
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,365
不仅能让你夜夜笙歌
Now, you could have done a lot of things

299
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:49,401
一如昨晚
with that credit card last night.

300
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,378
而且还能支付你父亲的医疗保险费
Your father's health insurance premium,

301
00:19:52,378 --> 00:19:53,929
及学业贷款
graduate school loans,

302
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,203
可你决定搬出群居屋
but you decided to take your mates out on the town,

303
00:19:57,203 --> 00:19:58,165
住市中心的独立大宅
living it large.

304
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,164
因为你必须熟悉另一半人的生活
Because you want to know how the other half lives.

305
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,210
另一半人即我们富人！
We are the other half!

306
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,762
这些我都能替你办到
That's what I'm offering you.

307
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,041
如果我拒绝呢？
If I say no?

308
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,046
你和你朋友们将受到最严厉的法律追究
You and your friends will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

309
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,503
你不会只想坐着
And you don't want to sit around

310
00:20:17,503 --> 00:20:19,524
看我沏茶吧？
and watch me make tea, do you?

311
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,328
你谁啊 电视警察？
What are you, the TV police?

312
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,126
- 你睡着了  - 我只是闭闭眼
- You were asleep. - My eyes were closed.

313
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,089
你去哪？
Where you going?

314
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,010
公司放假
I caught a break at the company.

315
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,528
放假 哪种假？
A break, what kind of break?

316
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,142
足够支付房租
A kind of break that pays our rent

317
00:21:02,142 --> 00:21:03,604
和护士费用的假
and keeps your pretty nurse around.

318
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,489
是培训来着 我整个周末都要忙
It's a training thing, so I'll be gone all weekend.

319
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,361
今天周五
It's Friday night.

320
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:08,450
不是说好去本齐奥吃披萨喝啤酒的吗？
I thought we were going to Benzio's for pizza and beer.

321
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,483
我要去上班了 爸爸
I got to work, Dad.

322
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:11,649
如此才能飞黄腾达
That's how you climb the ladder in this business.

323
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,768
就因为你比手下干得更卖力
You work harder than the guy below you.

324
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,247
结果只能干一辈子的苦力保安
Otherwise you get stuck doing the same job your whole life.

325
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,448
听着
Look...

326
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,802
这些钱给你电话定餐 好吗？
Here's some money. You can order in, OK?

327
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,247
不要 多谢
No, no. Thanks.

328
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,886
好了
All right.

329
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,484
你具体在公司做什么 朱迪斯？
What exactly do you do for the company, Judith?

330
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,166
我有行为心理学的博士学位
I have a PhD in behavioral psychology.

331
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,164
能告诉你为什么你至今尚未成功
I can take one look at you and tell you why you haven't succeeded.

332
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,163
不如敞开天窗说亮话吧？
Why don't you tell me how you really feel?

333
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,845
我有各种方式能令你…
I can give you the tools to ascend

334
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,321
跻身全美的上流社会
to the highest ranks of corporate America.

335
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,289
但首先你得端正态度
But you have to lose the attitude.

336
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,760
这边
This way.

337
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,046
我带你去房间
I'll show you to your room.

338
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,771
初次见面时
When we meet someone,

339
00:23:33,771 --> 00:23:36,609
形成所谓的第一印象
an immediate cognitive process takes place.

340
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,843
通常会以貌取人
We construct our first ideas on them based on their appearance.

341
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,322
所以你要想被人接受
So, if you want to be accepted,

342
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:44,210
就必须洞窥其中
you have to look the part.

343
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,004
融入并进入他们的生活
You have to fit in to get in.

344
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,288
怀特和戈达间发生了什么事？
What happened with Wyatt and Goddard?

345
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,680
乔克戈达是个聪明的生意人
Jack's a brilliant businessman.

346
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,388
他总是能够在他的产品中
He was always able to imbue his products

347
00:23:54,388 --> 00:23:56,004
融入许多神奇的理念
with a magic of big ideas,

348
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,770
而怀特则是大脑
but Wyatt was the brains.

349
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,762
没有他的设计
Without his designs,

350
00:23:58,762 --> 00:24:00,207
再神奇的理念都不能付诸实现
none of it would have been possible.

351
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,283
听起来是完美的搭档啊
Hmm. Sounds like a perfect pairing.

352
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,631
对戈达 算是
For Goddard, yes.

353
00:24:03,631 --> 00:24:06,411
怀特献出了一生中最好的时光
Wyatt gave him the best years of his life.

354
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,284
乔克戈达失去了儿子迪兰 因为服毒过量
Jock lost his son Dylan to a drug overdose.

355
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,046
所以 如果你谈到失去母亲…
So, if you talk about losing your mother...

356
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,806
不 我不会的
No, I won't.

357
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,726
会勾起他的回忆 趁机说你缺少父爱
Then, appeal to his void. Say you had no father figure.

358
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,291
我父亲还健在
I have a father.

359
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,448
你不想成为像他一样的人
You don't aspire to be like him.

360
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,445
信任的手段在于…
Which brings us to trust.

361
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,404
要使人信服 必须首先成为他
If you can convince him that you're just like him,

362
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,370
与之同信仰
that you share the same beliefs as him,

363
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,931
此乃信任的根源
it will engender trust.

364
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,246
信任是商业间谍的必杀技
And trust is the holy grail of espionage.

365
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,370
她说得轻巧
She makes it sound so easy.

366
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,212
在我没有成功之前
But this is a man who recognized me

367
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:01,763
这男人就认识我
for who I was years before I did.

368
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,097
与我走的很近
He kept me close

369
00:25:04,097 --> 00:25:06,164
是因为对敌的策略
because that's what you do with an enemy.

370
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,939
在我焦躁不安的时候 他允诺我担任合伙人
When I got restless, he promised me partnership.

371
00:25:08,939 --> 00:25:09,688
真是天才
It was genius.

372
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,133
在事业即将成功的时候
I saw the finish line

373
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:13,367
把我所有的金点子都给了他…
and I gave him every good idea I ha...

374
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,366
- 他是谁？  - 新裁缝
- Who's this? - He's the new tailor.

375
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,488
我是乔治盖德勒 先生
I'm George Gardelo, sir.

376
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,726
我们单独呆会好吗 乔治？
Would you excuse us, George?

377
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,484
- 当然  - 只要一会儿
- Yes. Of course. - Just for a second.

378
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,209
你怎么回事？
What's going on?

379
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,965
事情就是这个样子
That's how it happens.

380
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,966
小家伙用针线击败了一个帝国
A little guy with a needle and thread brings down an empire.

381
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,363
你真相信？
You really believe that?

382
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,701
形式无所谓
Look, it doesn't matter.

383
00:25:40,701 --> 00:25:42,922
真谛是千里之堤毁于蚁穴嘛
If you let no one in, you get burned by no one.

384
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,408
知道毕加索的名言吗？
You know what Picasso said?

385
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,311
“好的艺术家复制”
"A good artist copies."

386
00:25:53,663 --> 00:25:56,566
“伟大的艺术家偷窃”
"A great artist steals."

387
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,404
世界上没有什么东西是原创的 亚当
There's nothing original left in the world, Adam.

388
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,688
我们都是在偷窃
We're all stealing from someone.

389
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,491
你应该牢记这一点
You might want to remember that.

390
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,202
如果我损失1%的市场占有率
If I lose one percent market share,

391
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,091
只要1%我就毁了
one percent, and I'm ruined.

392
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,401
所谓的荷兰人生意
There is the Dutch deal,

393
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,211
但他们的开价只有艾康公司的一半
but they're offering half of what Eikon's willing to pay you.

394
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,044
不 我不介意
No, no, I don't care.

395
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,886
我宁可卖给荷兰人
I would rather counter the Dutch for a fraction

396
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,769
而不是戈达
than sell to Goddard.

397
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,321
卖给谁都比卖给艾康公司好
Anything's better than Eikon.

398
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,771
懂了
I know.

399
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,726
喂
Hello?

400
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,444
几时能帮我朋友们找到工作？
When are you going to find my friends jobs?

401
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,206
你一成功即可
As soon as you get me what I need.

402
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,610
你只有一次机会
You only have one shot at this.

403
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,442
将军
Mate.

404
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,089
汤姆伦格朗是艾康公司执行人事经理
Tom Lungren is executive hiring coordinator for Eikon.

405
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,767
你的目标是建立关系
Your objective here is to connect.

406
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,331
亚当？
Adam?

407
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,323
- 汤姆  - 汤姆伦格朗
- Tom. - Tom Lungren.

408
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,131
幸会 这位是艾玛詹宁斯
Nice to meet you. Let me introduce Emma Jennings,

409
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,288
我们的市场部经理
head of our marketing department.

410
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,362
幸会 艾玛
Nice to meet you, Emma.

411
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,851
请坐
Please, sit down.

412
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,487
我们还是从你那个…
Well, let me start off by saying that we're

413
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,610
Ethion 3.0展开话题吧
huge fans of the work you did on Ethion 3.0.

414
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,529
此项产品目前还没投入市场
Well, you know, it hasn't been released yet, so.

415
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,365
是因为电源管理部分还没有实现吗？
Is that because power management doesn't deliver?

416
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,363
不 电源管理没问题
No, the power management is fine.

417
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,090
这可与传闻不一样
That's not what we've heard.

418
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,685
我们正在调试网络模块
We're tweaking the networking module to make

419
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,205
以便达到市面上最快的下载速度
download speed the fastest on the market.

420
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,681
上帝 希望这不是我们找他的原因
Oh, God. I hope that's not why we agreed to meet with him.

421
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,490
你能说说配置吗？
Can you talk specs?

422
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,126
Orion采用LTE-A手机4G技术
The Orion was an LTE Advanced

423
00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:39,564
最大速率为44.2mbps
with max speeds of 44.2 mbps.

424
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,563
我们新平台则是WAVE OS 7.5…
Our new platform is a WAVE OS 7.5...

425
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,371
该版本可能尚未解决7.0版本中的致命缺陷
Which probably won't solve the biggest issues you had with 7.0.

426
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,087
而我们的销量是你们的两倍
It outsold your model two to one.

427
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:47,524
是啊 市场是王道
Yeah, the marketing was genius.

428
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,648
我一手策划的活动
I spearheaded that campaign.

429
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,451
因为你非常善于隐藏缺陷
Then you know you're good at hiding flaws.

430
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,565
你俩认识？
Have you two met?

431
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,245
没有
No.

432
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,210
不
No.

433
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,681
看来大家都出师不利
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

434
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,768
事前做好功课 这是你说的吧
Always do your homework. That's what you said, isn't it?

435
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,365
下次坚持我自己的意见吧
Next time follow your own advice.

436
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,166
- 难道不是汤姆·伦格朗？  - 是不光汤姆·伦格朗
- It wasn't Tom Lungren? - It wasn't just Tom Lungren.

437
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,845
我说过他可能带其它人来
I told you he might bring someone else.

438
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,206
带来的人我认识
Someone that I knew?

439
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,603
发生什么事？
What happened?

440
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,606
我用了一整天建立关系 漫天报价
I saved the day. Connected. Pulled an offer, a big-ass offer.

441
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,809
带你去新公寓吧
Let's take you to your new apartment.

442
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,611
- 什么公寓？  - 到时候你就知道了
- What apartment? - You'll see.

443
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,730
希望你喜欢
Thought you'd like it.

444
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,643
这是我的？
This is mine?

445
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,167
当然
Of course.

446
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,244
艾康公司的新经理看上去要像个有钱人
Eikon's newest executive needs to look the part.

447
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,962
很高兴再见到你 亚当
It's nice to see you again, Adam.

448
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,308
按照约定
Per our agreement,

449
00:30:14,308 --> 00:30:17,210
我们已将50万元打入了中介账户
we've deposited $500,000 into an escrow account.

450
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,648
据悉 戈达两个月内可能会在奥罗拉发布新品
We're hearing Goddard could debut Aurora in the next two months,

451
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,644
我下载了你所有新同事的背景资料
so I've downloaded background files on all your co-workers.

452
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,844
首先是艾玛詹宁斯
First, Emma Jennings.

453
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,809
其父乔治詹宁斯曾是…
Father, George Jennings, was

454
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,611
纽约长老会医院的外科主任
Chief of Surgery at New York Presbyterian.

455
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,489
她共有四个兄弟
She grew up with four brothers,

456
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,127
曾经在男子俱乐部外面寻找机会
was always on the outside of the boys club, looking in.

457
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,204
拼命地想在男人世界中获得一席之地
Desperately wants to succeed in a man's world,

458
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,721
她是群体内准备最充分的人
so she's always the most prepared person in the room.

459
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,042
早几个小时前的话 这些信息很有用
Would have been useful a couple of hours ago.

460
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,249
别浪费时间 她有择偶标准的
Don't waste your time. She has certain standards.

461
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,605
朱迪斯 或许你并没有想象的那么聪明
Judith, maybe you're not as smart as you think you are.

462
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,809
现在别再交流内心了
Now don't always say what you think, darling.

463
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,201
因为从现在开始
Because from here on out,

464
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:01,403
你是地下工作者
you are all the way under.

465
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,450
我们只能通过这部手机联络
We'll be communicating through this phone only.

466
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,681
无论早晚 你必须回复我的电话
You will respond to my calls, no matter the time, day or night.

467
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,002
明白
You got it.

468
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,444
早上好 先生
Good morning, sir.

469
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,887
把他的体征扫描报告复印件送到我办公室
I want a copy of his body scan sent to my office.

470
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,087
是 先生
Yes, sir.

471
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,085
- 亚当  - 伦格朗先生
- Adam. - Mr. Lungren.

472
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,884
我说过了 你别那样叫我
I told you. You gotta stop calling me that,

473
00:32:18,884 --> 00:32:20,005
让我感觉自己很老
you're gonna make me feel old.

474
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,447
- 欢迎来到艾康公司  - 谢谢 这里太棒了
- Welcome to Eikon. - Thank you. It's great to be here.

475
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,171
- 我们很庆幸你能来  - 谢谢
- We're damn glad to have you. - OK, good.

476
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,766
下几层是人事部
The lower floors are Legal, HR,

477
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,804
中层有一些其它部门 包括市场部
middle floors are all the other departments, including marketing.

478
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,804
38楼是最高安全机密的研发中心
The 38th floor is R&D, top security projects.

479
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,201
40楼到了
And we're here on the 40th.

480
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,931
这楼里有些规矩
There's just a few tricks to being in this building and getting around.

481
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,610
你按在钥匙卡上的指纹会生成密码
Your thumbprint on a keycard app generates a bar code

482
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,924
是你进入门禁系统的许可证
that gets you anywhere your clearance is allowed.

483
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,809
好的
All right.

484
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,850
聪慧的戈达有什么标语吗？
So any words of wisdom on Goddard?

485
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,923
卓越加诚恳
Be brilliant and be genuine.

486
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,448
他几英里外就能嗅到骗子
你的办公室
He can spot a fraud a mile away. Here's your office.

487
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,162
X型可用于社交网络
So, Type X was meant for social networking,

488
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,482
但事实证明人们并不总需要朋友
but it turns out that people don't always want their friends

489
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,210
准确的知道对方的方位
to know where they are so precisely.

490
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,727
没错 用的什么系统技术？
Right. What's the system tech?

491
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,601
3DPS 类似高精度GPS三角度量法
It's 3DPS, which is like GPS plus precise triangulation.

492
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,966
我对那个很熟悉
I'm familiar with it.

493
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,527
问题是两倍的重量造成电池消耗快三倍
Problem is, it's twice as heavy with three times the battery drain.

494
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,286
你算是给我出难题咯？
So, you're handing me a dead fish.

495
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,166
你有72小时 然后报告戈达
You've got 72 hours before you present to Goddard.

496
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,328
谢谢
Thank you.

497
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,646
这是一个实时跟踪装置 可以用于新用途
It's a real-time tracking device that needs a new purpose.

498
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,167
初次见面必须给他留下极深的印象
It's all about the presentation. You have to impress him.

499
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,926
我明白我该怎么做
Yes, I understand what I have to do.

500
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,009
我计划和研发中心的伙计们来一次头脑风暴
I'll schedule a brainstorming session with our best R&D guys.

501
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,088
你为啥干这份工作 朱迪斯？
Why do you do this work, Judith?

502
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,805
为忠诚还是为了钱？
I mean, is it out of loyalty, or is it just money?

503
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,010
你还有心考虑别人的事？
Don't you have enough to think about?

504
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,844
罗伊娜 召集所有…
Rowena, I need you to put together

505
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,604
研发小组成员
an R&D focus group.

506
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,528
我不管 叫醒他们
I don't care, wake them up.

507
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,889
准备好了通知我 再见
Call me when everything's in place. Bye.

508
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,007
士兵
Soldiers.

509
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,211
士兵们需要时刻知道对方在哪里
Soldiers need to know where each other are at all times.

510
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,125
- 他们有GPS  - 是的
- They have GPS. - Yeah.

511
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,567
GPS 适合导航 但在室内毫无用处
GPS is great for navigation, but it doesn't work indoors.

512
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,563
不能确定你是在一楼还是在九楼
Can't tell if you're on the first floor or the ninth,

513
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,210
所以在城市战中毫无用途
so it's useless in urban warfare.

514
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,681
但是3DPS
But with 3DPS,

515
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,601
如果我向所有人的电邮进行木马追踪…
if I can Trojan-horse tracking data in an e-mail to each of them...

516
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,287
…这事情兴许能成
...I could make this thing work.

517
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,049
- 你打给谁？  - 我自己的研发团队
- Who are you calling? - My own R&D focus group.

518
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,564
凯文 是我 我需要你帮忙
Yo, Kev, it's me. I need your help.

519
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,091
我被几家公司相中
I got recruited by one of those...

520
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,320
…猎头公司
...headhunters.

521
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,910
长话短说
Long story short,

522
00:35:00,585 --> 00:35:03,042
我现在在艾康公司
I work for Eikon now.

523
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,926
听说他们不招人
I heard they weren't hiring.

524
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,964
我猜我走运吧
I got lucky, I guess.

525
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,804
我想也是
I guess.

526
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,367
我现在干的一个项目
Well, hey, I've been working on what we talked about,

527
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,842
绝对在军事上有用武之地
and the military thing is definitely possible.

528
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,403
我修改了一下艾康公司的软件
I just tweaked the Eikon software a little.

529
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,402
我称之为飞去来器
I'm calling it the Boomerang.

530
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,489
请看演示
Just check this out.

531
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,653
我把你的3DPS数据电邮给你
I sent your 3DPS data e-mail to you,

532
00:35:34,653 --> 00:35:35,681
我还有艾莉森
me and Allison.

533
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,764
现在我们的手机并网了
So now our phones track each other working in unison.

534
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,485
你说的对 3DPS
And you were right, the SDPS,

535
00:35:40,485 --> 00:35:42,208
是划时代的技术
that's what makes the difference.

536
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,129
你找我就找对人了
That was a good call, by the way.

537
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,008
伙计太棒了 干的好
Dude, that's awesome. You crushed this. Good job.

538
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,640
还没完
Yeah, but that ain't all.

539
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,124
接入艾莉森
Pick up Allison.

540
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,005
- 你要什么？  - 再一杯橙汁
- What can I get you? - Another OJ.

541
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,127
再一杯橙汁
One more OJ.

542
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,009
你是怎么做到的？
How the hell did you do that?

543
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,810
谁点的橙汁？
Who orders orange juice in a bar?

544
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,247
看来有人想要保持神秘感
Someone who wants to keep his edge.

545
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,323
- 你叫什么名字？  - 艾莉森
- What's your name? - Allison.

546
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,931
你认识那个人吗？
Do you know that guy?

547
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,640
橙汁先生！
Hey, OJ!

548
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,290
我们是一起睡的 我和她
We're sleeping together, me and her.

549
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,168
很高兴认识你 艾莉森
Nice to meet you, Allison.

550
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,829
我就只能坐在这里
All I do is sit around here,

551
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:28,960
不停的看人勾引她
watching her get hit on all the time.

552
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,286
累死我了！
It's exhausting!

553
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,363
我需要工作
I need a job.

554
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,447
早晨好 卡罗琳
让一下
Good morning, Caroline. Excuse me.

555
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,887
- 乔克·戈达  - 亚当·坎西迪
- Jock Goddard. - Adam Cassidy.

556
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,272
原来就是你啊 一切都还行？
Of course you are. Everything all right?

557
00:37:19,272 --> 00:37:20,089
安顿得如何？
Settling in OK?

558
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,083
- 谢谢  - 办公室怎么样？
- Yeah. Thank you. - How's your office?

559
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,022
很漂亮 谢谢
Oh, yeah, it's beautiful. Thank you.

560
00:37:24,022 --> 00:37:25,210
很好 我们开始吧
- Good. Let's get started.

561
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,521
好的
OK.

562
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,085
先生 我认为你把X型用于…
Well, sir, I'm afraid you've wasted a lot of money

563
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,210
开发社交网络设备是个浪费行为
developing Type X as a social networking device.

564
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,250
因为此设备在军事方面相当有前景
But the military applications of this device are undeniable.

565
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,124
早上我给所有人发了邮件
I sent you all an e-mail this morning

566
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,682
内含类3DPS身份鉴别数据
in which I encoded 3DPS-like data to identify you.

567
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,405
会议室里所有人都收到了电邮
Everyone I sent an e-mail to is in this room.

568
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:46,242
除了一人
Except for one.

569
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,122
现代战争还是无法避免被友方误伤
Death by friendly fire remains a sad reality of war.

570
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,568
而3DPS比GPS更精确 并含海拔高度数据
3DPS is more precise than GPS and works on a Z-axis.

571
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,485
虽然对普通人来说这个产品太重
While the product was deemed too heavy for civilians,

572
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,849
不过多12盎司对于士兵来说不算什么
an added 12 ounces is nothing to a soldier.

573
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,685
这就是你对于我们手机项目的完整分析？
So this is all so you can see what floor our phones are on?

574
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,221
是的 战争进入白热化状态时
Yes. 'Cause in the heat of battle

575
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:07,247
它会有不俗的表现
that can be the difference

576
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,165
命悬杀死敌人或者…
between killing the enemy or...

577
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,530
…被敌人杀死的一线间
...killing your own.

578
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,090
X型则刚好挽救了她的生命
Type X just saved her life.

579
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,601
早
Good morning.

580
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,524
早 对不起
Good morning, sorry.

581
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,242
早
Morning.

582
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,971
你用了多久研究结论？
How long have you had with this?

583
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,446
72小时 先生
Seventy-two hours, sir.

584
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,122
为亚当组建一个团队
Let's put together a team for Adam.

585
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,258
设计工程部
Design, engineering.

586
00:38:39,258 --> 00:38:41,170
打探下能否得到国防部资助
Let's see if we can get some DOD funding.

587
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,483
有问题吗？ 没有？ 很好
Issues? No? Good.

588
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,290
很好
Good.

589
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,288
- 棒极了  - 好
- Nice work. - OK.

590
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,288
一切进展顺利
I thought that went pretty well.

591
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,171
新手的好运
Beginner's luck.

592
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,521
想取悦你还真不容易
You are hard to please.

593
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:02,723
与你预料的有差距
Not that you'd remember.

594
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,167
这周末我们一起晚餐吧
Let me take you to dinner this weekend.

595
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,249
这周末我必须去汉普顿
I have to be in the Hamptons this weekend.

596
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,641
好啊 我和你一起去
Oh, good. I'll come with you.

597
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,091
这可不是邀请
It wasn't an invitation.

598
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,450
好的
OK.

599
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,205
你好 亚当 我是乔克·戈达的助理
Hi, Adam. I'm calling from Jock Goddard's office.

600
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,806
乔克先生邀请部分客人光临他在汉普顿的家
Jock is having a few people over to his house in the Hamptons

601
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,361
时间是星期六 他希望你也来

602

目前已申请军方资助了
So now we go for military funding.

603
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,284
好极了 祝贺你
Dude, that's great. Congratulations, man.

604
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,367
我有一事相求
Hey, so, I got a favor to ask.

605
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,562
我下周要到艾康公司面试
I got an interview at Eikon next week.

606
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,408
也许我的简历会成为故纸推中的一张
And I know I'm gonna be another resume in a stack

607
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,722
除非我有闪光点
if I don't build some traction.

608
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,368
对
Right.

609
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,809
很难为情 不过…
So, I feel awkward even asking you this, but...

610
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,644
别担心
Hey, of course.

611
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,729
周一我会和人事部打招呼的
All right, I'll speak to HR on Monday.

612
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,370
放心吧
All right.

613
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,200
多谢
Thanks.

614
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,321
那家伙人还不错
Nicest guy.

615
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,087
闯红灯追尾我的车
Right through the red light and hit the back of the car.

616
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,328
- 诚恳的道歉  - 有人破财了
- Very apologetic. - Somebody looks lost.

617
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,329
- 他来了  - 很高兴你能来
- There he is. - I'm glad you could make it.

618
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,324
- 谢谢你的邀请 戈达先生  - 叫我乔克
- Thanks for having me, Mr. Goddard. - Jock.

619
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,130
你认识汤姆的 对吧
You know Tom, of course.

620
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,828
乔克告诉我说股票升值了
Jock tells me my stock's gone up in value

621
00:41:28,828 --> 00:41:30,285
因为你对X型的定位
since your Type X pitch.

622
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,033
上场第一击就爆掉了计分牌
First time up at bat and you bang it off the scoreboard?

623
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:33,489
就该这么干
Way to go.

624
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,086
这是艾玛 负责我们的…
And this is Emma. She's spearheading the marketing

625
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,720

西装不错
Nice suit.

627
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,731
别小看她
Watch our for her.

628
00:41:41,731 --> 00:41:44,565
她可是普林斯顿常青藤大学的高材生哟
She's one of those Ivy Leaguers. Princeton.

629
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,324
应该是耶鲁大学吧？
Yale, actually.

630
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,329
她兄弟们也念耶鲁大学
Where her brothers went.

631
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,126
你怎么知道我是耶鲁的？
How did you know I went to Yale?

632
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,891
脸书或是别的地方听说的
It was on Facebook or something.

633
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,328
毫无隐私啊
So much for privacy.

634
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,371
隐私 现在已经是种笑话了
Privacy. Absolute myth, no such thing.

635
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,602
- 汤姆 想喝一杯吗？  - 当然
- Tom, you want a drink? - Yeah, absolutely.

636
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,051
白葡萄酒 先生？
A glass of wine, sir?

637
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,089
- 白葡萄酒  - 我要冰矿泉水
- White wine. - Mineral water, cold.

638
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,124
待会见
See you later.

639
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,246
有点像波尔多 太干了
Kind of like a Bordeaux, more dry.

640
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,966
如果你在找卫生间 走过头了
if you're looking for the bathroom, you missed it.

641
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,087
不好意思 …
Yeah, sorry, I, uh...

642
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,448
我看到那个收音机  还能用吗？
I saw the radio. Does it work?

643
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,207
还能用 全都能用 我做的
Yeah, they work. They all work. I built them.

644
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,887
十多岁时的癖好 火腿一族(业余无线电)
That's how I spent my teens. Ham radio.

645
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,610
你在哪儿长大？
Where'd you grow up?

646
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,889
汉米尔顿 人口约3500人
Town of Hamilton, 3500 people.

647
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,202
那是哪里？
Where is that?

648
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,165
不值一提
It doesn't matter.

649
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,112
你让我想起怀特公司
You remind me of Wyatt.

650
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:07,483
非常吃惊他们居然放你走
I'm surprised he let you go.

651
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,483
他对我不甚感兴趣
He wasn't too happy about it.

652
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,962
我知道有一天他们会成为我的强力竞争对手
I knew he'd be my competition someday.

653
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,088
我在他意识到之前就意识到了
I knew it before he did.

654
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,924
那你为什么把他收入麾下？
Why'd you take him under your wing?

655
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,481
与他个人无关 事关开发产品…
It's not about him. It's about putting products out there

656
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,768
能让人们生活的更好
to make people's lives better.

657
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,968
竞争推动创新
Competition fuels innovation.

658
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,487
否则就没有艾康公司的今天
Without it, Eikon wouldn't be where it is today.

659
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,489
现在发展到什么阶段了？
And where is that?

660

革命前夜
On the eve of a revolution.

661

662
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,640
是的 迪兰
Yeah, that's Dylan.

663
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,682
人一旦有点成功 就会觉得自己…
You have a bit of success, you begin to think

664
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:51,209
能左右一些事情 但…
that you've got some control over things, but...

665
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,528
…天往往不遂人愿
...shit happens to everybody.

666
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,251
是啊
Yeah.

667
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,647
我7岁时丧母
I lost my mother when I was seven.

668
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,648
你还记得她吗？
Do you remember her?

669
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,924
不太记得了
Not much.

670
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,560
我感觉她逐渐离我远去
I feel like I lose her a little more every day.

671
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,245
对
Yeah.

672
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,569
迪兰死后的很多夜晚
Couple nights after Dilly died,

673
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,690
我常在夜晚痛醒
I woke up in the middle of the night in a panic.

674
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,166
翻遍整个房子 他的整个房间…
Rummaged through the whole house, his whole room...

675
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,688
…试图找到一点慰籍
...looking for anything.

676
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,690
孩提的涂鸦画 作业本…

…旧网球鞋
...old pair of tennis shoes.

678
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:45,051
一切能回忆起他的东西
Anything that would keep him alive.

679
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,765
在前厅楼梯口
The front hall, under the stairs.

680
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,325
什么先生？
Sir?

681
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,767
卫生间
The bathroom.

682
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,165
谢谢
Thanks.

683
00:46:15,636 --> 00:46:16,178

684
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,049
你的西装也没那么差劲啦
You know, the suit's not all that bad.

685
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,601
你不用藏在这里
You don't have to hide way out here.

686
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,883
我这是欲擒故纵
I was, uh, playing hard to get.

687
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,691
显然你得手了
But you're already gotten.

688
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,927
告诉我
So tell me,

689
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,684
你怎么会了解我那么多事
how is it that you know so much about me

690
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,764
而我却对你一无所知？
and I know nothing about you?

691
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,609
我祖母住的是一个小房间
It's this, uh, little row home my grandmother owned.

692
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,808
五个人共用洗手间
Five of us sharing one bathroom.

693
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,531
我爸爸曾是保安
My dad was a security guard.

694
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,650
现在患有肺气肿 但还在吸烟
Now he has emphysema, but still smokes.

695
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,610
我敢肯定他把烟藏在护士那儿
And I'm pretty sure he's putting it to the nurse I'm paying for.

696
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,367
每当我想到要失去他…
When I think of losing him...

697
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,645
你呢？
What about you?

698
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,847
我家教严格…
I come from a family where...

699
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,191
家里期望过高
the expectation is so high

700
00:47:16,191 --> 00:47:17,844
我真的难以达成
that I can't really ever succeed.

701
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,248
好在我一直有努力
It's fine, it's just that I keep trying.

702
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,010
那么…
So...

703
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,810
我想一路睡到高层
I'm trying to sleep my way to the top.

704
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,802
地下恋情么？
Are we covered?

705
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,443
得了 带我回家？
Come on. Take me home?

706
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,568
好
Yeah.

707
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,805
爸爸？
Dad?

708
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,326
有客人来
You got a visitor.

709
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,364
你是谁？
Who are you?

710
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,206
你应该扣掉手机电池
You might want to remove the battery from your cellular device.

711
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,321
什么？
What?

712
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,202
别以为你没在通话状态
You think 'cause you're not on a call,

713
00:51:27,202 --> 00:51:28,086
他们就听不到你
they can't hear you?

714
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,490
探员甘布
Agent Gamble.

715
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,247
FBI犯罪调查科
I'm with the FBI's Criminal Investigation Division.

716
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,163
我们调查怀特公司有五年了
We've been looking at the Wyatt Corp for about five years now.

717
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,566
- 我不在怀特公司工作  - 约翰·摩尔是怀特员工
- I don't work for Wyatt. - John Moore did.

718
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,121
他09年就参与了怀特公司的培训程序
He was in Wyatt's training program in '09.

719
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,324
史黛·拉罗斯
Stella Ross,

720
00:51:54,324 --> 00:51:57,961
像你一样从怀特跳槽到艾康公司
migrated from Wyatt to Eikon like you.

721
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,091
两个月后死于汽车的转向柱爆炸
Two months later, her steering column exploded.

722
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,203
理查德·麦卡利斯特…
And Richard McAllister...

723
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,010
你剽窃过他的Ethion方案
whose Ethion work you drafted off of.

724
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,964
我没有剽窃他的工作
I didn't draft off his work.

725
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,963
一个月前 你还在怀特闲晃
A month ago, you were circling the drain at Wyatt.

726
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,760
现在你却是艾康公司的座上宾？
Now you're some hotshot exec over at Eikon?

727
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,841
别扯蛋了
Don't bullshit me.

728
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,968
好的 我想你可以走了
OK, I think it's time for you to go.

729
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,288
你以为怀特会给你一大笔钱然后让你安然离开？
You think Wyatt's gonna fill your pockets and let you walk?

730
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,965
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about, OK?

731
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,561
别这样 亚当
Come on, Adam.

732
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,722
你以为你还能挺多久？
How long do you think you can keep this up?

733
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,610
只要一个过失 你立马就玩完
All it takes is one mistake, one slip up.

734
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,126
对不起 我帮不了你
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

735
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,003
别追悔莫及
Just don't wait till it's too late.

736
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,404
你不打算告诉我发生什么事了吗？
You wanna tell me what's going on?

737
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,285
你不懂的
You wouldn't understand.

738
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,807
我以前太匆忙
Yeah, I was probably too busy

739
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,691
每天供你三餐
putting three meals in front of you every day

740
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,650
给你别人都有的父母之爱
and giving you all the love that parents had.

741
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,122
亚当 我们会过得幸福的
Come on, Adam. We had a perfect life.

742
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,085
如果花在你身上的保险有一半能用在妈妈…
You know, if your insurance covered even half of what morn needed...

743
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,440
别和病魔斗争
Don't try to revise death.

744
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,601
不然你希望我怎么样？
What did you want me to do?

745
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,728
我希望你斗争
I wanted you to fight.

746
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,042
我想我们至少能给妈一次机会
I wanted us to have enough to at least give her a chance.

747
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,049
但你却放弃了
You gotta give that up.

748
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,814
这些公司把财富都偷走了
These companies steal so much,

749
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:55,250
不剩一点
there's nothing left to earn.

750
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,880
你的所为也没有什么成效
Yeah, what you're doing doesn't make it right.

751
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,088
没有
No.

752
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,447
没有人能绝对正确
No one can make it right.

753
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,763
我为什么不能得到属于自己的一份？
So, why shouldn't I get my share? Huh?

754
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,922
FBI刚从我们家离开
The FBI just walked out of our house.

755
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,367
我不想跟你一样的人生
I don't want to end up like you.

756
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,809
原来乔克是这个想法
So that's what he's up to.

757
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,204
你要的都齐了
That's what you wanted.

758
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,328
任务完成 卑鄙的我
I'm done now. This isn't who I am.

759
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,280
你本性如此 搜过他身没有？
This is exactly who you are. Did you frisk him?

760
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,123
你有所隐藏？
You hiding something?

761
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,924
住手！
Knock it Off!

762
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,691
你最近内心有点波澜吧？
You've been a little temperamental lately, haven't you?

763
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,251
你爱上那女人了？
Are you falling for that girl?

764
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,643
- 他爱上的是乔克  - 好了 好了！
- He's falling for Jock. - All right, all right!

765
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,245
他说什么了？
What'd he talk about?

766
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,802
他谈到科技进步 丰富了人们的生活
He talked about progress, enriching people's lives.

767
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,122
谈到他儿子了吗？
Yeah, he talk about his son?

768
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,203
说了一点
Yeah. A little.

769
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,928
是不是很耳熟？
It seem rehearsed?

770
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,161
不
No.

771
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,403
我早就说了
It did the first time he told it.

772
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,881
当全世界都爱上乔克·戈达的时候
That was when the world fell in love with Jock Goddard,

773
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,168
痛不欲生的父亲
the grieving father.

774
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:53,571
幸好因为他儿子的噩耗拯救了艾康公司
That story of his little dead boy saved Eikon.

775
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,609
我已经拿到你想要的 懂吗？
I got what you asked for, OK?

776
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,205
我们有约在先 我只想拿到我的钱
We had a deal. I just want my money.

777
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,328
他想拿份内钱
Oh, he wants his money.

778
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,832
钱我们暂时替你保管
We'll keep your money for you.

779
00:56:00,832 --> 00:56:02,404
你还得更进一步
You'll be doing five to ten upstate.

780
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,324
我已经按约定拿到了规格书 说好的
I got the specs. That was the deal.

781
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,608
光有图片还不够好
Pictures are no good to me.

782
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,979
我需要知道是什么情况
I need to know what it does,

783
00:56:07,979 --> 00:56:09,770
我想要的是把它拿在手里 看实际运行效果！
I need to hold it in my hand and see it run!

784
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,207
听懂了没有 必须拿到我手里！
Do you understand me? Put it in my fucking hand!

785
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,362
不然怎样？ 像理查德一样被终结？
Or what? I end up like Richard?

786
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,611
乔克负责建立原型体
Jock builds one prototype.

787
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,168
各部件的组装都在研发中心密室进行
It's assembled in the vault, piece by piece,

788
00:56:30,168 --> 00:56:32,242
直到验收测试
until beta trials.

789
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,482
这间密室位于第38层
It stays in the vault on the 38th floor.

790
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,246
没有文件 没有源码 你什么也…
Without files, without source code, you can't do...

791
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,880
不 我不需要他的文件
No, I don't need his files.

792
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,649
我只需看到他的思想原型
I just need to see his vision.

793
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,386
不 我不干了
No, I'm not doing this anymore.

794
00:56:46,386 --> 00:56:47,283
我退出
I'm out.

795
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,245
你退出？ 孩子 等我说你可以退出的时候
You're out? You are only out, my son,

796
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,244
你才能退出
when I say you're out!

797
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,448
你现在受我胁迫
I own you right now.

798
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:03,281
明白吗？一切尽在我的掌握
You see? I can get to anyone.

799
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,170
别把事情复杂化
Don't make this harder than it has to be.

800
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,854
生意就是生意 亚当
It's just business, Adam.

801
00:57:11,854 --> 00:57:13,649
每个人都偷窃 每个人都说谎
Everybody steals, everybody lies.

802
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,007
无所谓对错
There's no right or wrong.

803
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,964
只有输和赢
There's just winning or losing.

804
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,662
现在第一步任务
Now the first order of business

805
00:57:27,662 --> 00:57:30,087
是提取艾玛的指纹
is lifting Emma's fingerprints.

806
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,571
我父母最近忙着操办…
So my parents are having this thing

807
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,525
我哥在周末的婚礼
for my brother's engagement this weekend.

808
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,087
要我一起去吗？
You wanna go with me?

809
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,484
拜见父母？
To meet your parents?

810
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,449
吃顿饭而已
It's just dinner and drinks.

811
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,329
你们…
You, uh...

812
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,962
你确定可以和我发展长久关系了？
You sure I'm relationship material?

813
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,649
算了 一起吃饭也挺无聊的
You know what? It's... It's actually gonna be really boring.

814
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,451
你不去也好
Probably better if you don't.

815
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,168
我当然去
Of course I will.

816
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,288
无聊也去？
Even if it is boring?

817
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,801
是 无聊也去
Yeah, even if it's boring.

818
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,965
怎么了你？
Hey, what happened to you?

819
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,288
凯文 你怎么来了？
Kev! What are you doing here?

820
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,363
你以为我在做什么？
What do you think I'm doing here?

821
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,329
对 面试
Your interview. Right.

822
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,123
- 情况如何？ 我和人事部门招呼过了  - 不 你没有
- How'd it go? I spoke to HR. - No, you didn't.

823
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,485
对不起 兄弟 我…
I'm sorry, man. I, uh...

824
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,651
我最近压力很大
I've been under a ton of pressure.

825
00:58:59,651 --> 00:59:00,363
完全忘了…
I completely forgot...

826
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,682
是啊 我理解你
Yeah, I understand, man.

827
00:59:01,682 --> 00:59:03,729
你去了新公司 买新车 有新女朋友
Your new apartment, new car, new girlfriend.

828
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,370
你真不知道我的处境
You have no idea what I'm dealing with.

829
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,530
是 我不知道 这辈子也无法知道了
No, I don't. And I don't think I ever will.

830
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,887
- 谢谢  - 凯文 我真的很抱歉
- Thanks. - Come on, Kev. I'm sorry, man.

831
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,201
凯文！
Kev!

832
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,243
戈达先生想见你
Mr. Goddard wants to see you.

833
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,525
好 我知道的
Yeah, I understand that.

834
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,594
怀特公司必须考虑我方的提议
Wyatt has to consider our offer.

835
00:59:22,594 --> 00:59:23,643
他没的选
He has no choice.

836
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,451
我指的是 他现在像是在泰坦尼克号上跳舞
(马上要完蛋)
I mean, he's tap dancing on the Titanic.

837
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,080
进来吧
Come on in.

838
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,526
有人进来了而已
Look, somebody just walked in.

839
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,409
我有些事务要处理下
I've got something I've got to deal with.

840
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,449
好吧 谢谢
All right. Thanks.

841
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,005
别忘记您在俱乐部预订的午餐
Don't forget, you have a lunch reservation at the club.

842
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,450
我们去兜兜风 顺便请你吃午饭
Come on. Let's take a drive. I'll buy you lunch.

843
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,406
今早收到一些与你有关的新闻
Got some interesting news this morning concerning you.

844
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,571
说给你听之前 我得确认真假
Thought I'd make sure it was true before I talk to you about it.

845
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,127
- 一切还好吧？  - 你说呢
- Is everything all right? - You tell me.

846
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:59,928
国防部同意投资X型了
The DOD has given us preliminary funding for Type X.

847
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,444
- 就停这里吧 戈达先生  - 谢了 伙计
- We'll leave it here, Mr. Goddard. - Thanks, Bud.

848
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,444
- 觉得怎样？  - 充满了力量
- Well, what do you think? - It's powerful.

849
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,001
没错
Yeah, it is.

850
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,447
算是你拯救X型项目的红利吧
Consider it a loaner for saving Type X.

851
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,444
- 乔克 我不能接受  - 你可以
- Jock, I couldn't. - Yeah, you could.

852
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:27,008
力量就像果汁 你得习惯饮用它
Power is the juice, get used to drinking it.

853
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,009
我听你谈到Occura
I heard you talking about Occura.

854
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,605
外面有很多疯传
There's a lot of buzz about it.

855
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,730
是的 Occura项目已经待产
Yeah, Occura's been, uh, gestating

856
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,805
这些年来
for... quite a few years.

857
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,486
直到最近我们才能…
We only recently were able to put

858
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,166
把所有的元素组装成实用版本
all of the elements together to make it happen.

859
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,890
- 一杯咖啡  - 一杯水
- I'll have coffee. - I'll have a water.

860
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,121
好的
Very good.

861
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,489
想象外出时除了手机什么都不带
Imagine walking around with nothing but your cell phone.

862
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,961
没有钱包 没有钥匙
No wallet, no keys.

863
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,929
手机可以是数字钱包
Like a digital wallet.

864
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,367
是驾照 是信用卡
It'll be your driver's license, it'll be your credit card,

865
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,487
是很多其它东西
it'll be more than that.

866
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,159
超薄可折叠
Super slim. Foldable,

867
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:02,645
能自充电
with a battery that recharges itself

868
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,491
只要附近有环境电源
from any ambient electrical source.

869
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,650
它知道你去过哪里 和谁去的
It'll know where you've been, who you've been with.

870
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,691
它能帮你处理轻重缓急 理财
It'll track your priorities, expenditures,

871
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,844
监管身体 日程安排
your health, calendar.

872
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,319
它知道你的全部
It will know who you are.

873
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:19,925
而它则受我们的控制
And it's all ours.

874
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,481
你真的认为同处一室的人…
You think people really want all that personal information

875
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,801
也会要这样的私人信息？
under one roof?

876
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,009
与同处一室无关 亚当
It's not the roof that matters, Adam.

877
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:31,444
它提供的是一种家的温暖感觉
It's the warm fuzzy feeling of the home under it.

878
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,577
现在的人都神经兮兮的
People are so distracted these days,

879
01:01:33,577 --> 01:01:35,127
经常连自己是谁都忘了
they don't know who they are.

880
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,520
但我们不会
But we will.

881
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,650
我们甚至比他们自己更了解他们
We'll know them better than they know themselves.

882
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,528
天啊
Oh, my goodness.

883
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,607
乔克
Jock.

884
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,250
尼克
Nick.

885
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,010
多久没见了？
How long has it been?

886
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,923
没多久
Not long enough.

887
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,686
你还是一副一柱擎天的气势
You look like you're holding up all right.

888
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,083
喔 还行 哪阵风把你吹到这儿来的？
Oh, I'm doing fine. What brings you here?

889
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,681
午饭风 午饭风驱使我来的
Lunch. Lunch brings me here.

890
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,563
- 你还记得朱迪斯吗  - 当然
- You remember Judith. - Oh, of course.

891
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,643
- 你好 朱迪斯？  - 还行
- How are you, Judith? - Good.

892
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,263
记得亚当·坎西迪吗？
You remember Adam Cassidy.

893
01:02:16,263 --> 01:02:17,565
是他设计了你的Ethion
He designed your Ethion.

894
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,927
当然是他
Yes, he did.

895
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,683
你也好 亚当
Hello, again, Adam.

896
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,569
他让我想起了你
He reminds me of you.

897
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,206
回想当年 你抛弃了我们
Way back when, before you walked out on us.

898
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,725
别颠倒黑白吧
Let's not muddle the facts.

899
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,644
是你赶我走 然后关上我身后的门
You asked me to walk and locked the door behind me.

900
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,531
好在我比亚当聪明点
Besides, I was smarter than Adam here.

901
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,682
我没有浪费时间去拍你的马屁
And I didn't spend all my time kissing your ass.

902
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,453
Ethion项目进展如何？
How is Ethion?

903
01:02:41,453 --> 01:02:44,609
我们有些耳闻
We've heard remarkably little about it.

904
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,454
Ethion项目进展顺利
Ethion's fine.

905
01:02:46,454 --> 01:02:47,923
Occura项目如何？
How's Occura?

906
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,003
计划之中
Right on schedule.

907
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,851
有一点你永远无法复制
And it's something you're never going to be able to duplicate.

908
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,729
是什么？
Is that so?

909
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,209
尼克 记得我们曾经共同创意？
Remember when we used to share ideas, Nick?

910
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,600
我没忘
I try not to.

911
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,493
我俩一起时
When we put our heads together,

912
01:03:02,493 --> 01:03:04,606
没有我们解决不了的问题
there was no problem we couldn't solve.

913
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,404
没有什么我们做不出来的
Nothing we couldn't make.

914
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,608
应该是没什么我解决不了的困难
There was no problem I couldn't solve.

915
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,643
没什么我做不出来的东西
Nothing I couldn't make.

916
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,448
我怀念你的友谊
I miss your friendship.

917
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,405
不如我们什么时候再聚聚
Why don't we sit down together sometime.

918
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,967
你总是满嘴胡言 你坐着就像…
Always so full of shit. You sit here like...

919
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,566
…像个令人仰慕的大亨
...like some big shot with boy wonder here,

920
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,644
用屁股吞云吐雾 搞的煞有介事
blowing smoke up your ass like it's still relevant.

921
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,280
事实是我会埋葬了你
The truth is, I'm gonna bury you,

922
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,967
替你工作的人将会替我工作
and your boy here is gonna be working for me again.

923
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,006
因为替你工作就是替我工作
Because working for you, means he'll be working for me.

924
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,125
别让午餐变冷 尼克
Don't let your lunch get cold, Nick.

925
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,922
很高兴见到你 朱迪斯
Nice seeing you, Judith.

926
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,207
他一遍一遍的查戈达的资料
He's running search after search on Goddard.

927
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,243
他在找什么？
What is he looking for?

928
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,811
我不知道
I don't know.

929
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,605
我觉得这孩子已经开始动摇了
I think this boy's gone soft on us.

930
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,846
你不接我的电话？
Were you going to ignore my call?

931
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,322
你应该告诉我怀特也会去
You should have told me Wyatt was gonna be there.

932
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,721
你为什么来回的踱步 看上去很紧张
Why do you keep pacing so much? You look nervous.

933
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,609
有什么要说的吗？
You have something you want to tell me?

934
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,651
你在哪？
Where are you?

935
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,723
现在我来解释下一步行动
Now let me explain to you how this is going to work.

936
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,729
我们拿你一个朋友开刀
We hit one of your friends first.

937
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,729
可能是个女性
Or maybe the girl.

938
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,002
如果你敢动她…
If you even touch her...

939
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,891
那就去拿到我们所要的东西
Then get us what we need.

940
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,731
给你两天时间入侵艾康公司
You have two days to break into Eikon.

941
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,969
最后一次警告
This is your last warning.

942
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:48,207
帮帮我！快来帮帮我
Help! Help me! Somebody help me!

943
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:57,005
他说我有两天时间 前晚说的
He said I had two days. That was the night before last.

944
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,145
这些人无孔不入
These people are everywhere.

945
01:07:59,145 --> 01:08:00,926
在你家中布满摄像头
Put cameras in your house.

946
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,564
对不起 我只是…
I'm sorry. I just...

947
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,003
我搞砸了 爸爸
I messed up, Dad.

948
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,047
我本以为知道自己在干什么
I thought I knew what I was doing.

949
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,321
你必须自谋生路
You have to figure a way out.

950
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,441
亚当
Adam.

951
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,087
亚当
Adam.

952
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,891
- 亚当！  - 是真的 好吗？
- Adam! - This is serious, OK?

953
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,444
你必须自谋生路
You got to figure a way out.

954
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,290
没那么容易
It's not that easy.

955
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,081
好吗？关心我的人都处于危险之中
OK? I put a lot of people I care about in danger.

956
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:57,081
亚当 我觉得FBI是唯一的选择
Adam, I think the FBI is the only option.

957
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,928
我会坐牢的
I could go to jail.

958
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,490
不然他们会杀了你
Or they could kill you.

959
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,568
一辆黑车突然窜出来撞倒了他
There was a black car and it just came out of nowhere and it hit him.

960
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,728

你在哪儿？
Slow down. Is he all right? Where are you?

961
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,798
我联系了你一整天

962
01:09:56,798 --> 01:09:58,521
凯文在医院 他还好
Kev's at the hospital, but he's OK.

963
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,330
我猜他们在威胁我们
I think they're discharging us now.

964
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,608
有目击证人吗？有没有看到牌照？
OK, were there witnesses? Did anyone get the plates?

965
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,084
不清楚 不知道
I don't think so. I don't know,

966
01:10:04,084 --> 01:10:05,770
一切来得太快 我得走了
it just all happened so fast. I got to go.

967
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,922
- 记得再电话我  - 我会的
- OK, call me back. - I will.

968
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,969
你什么毛病？！
Hey! What's the matter with you?!

969
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,248
闪开！
Go, go, go, go!

970
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,525
跪下
On your knees.

971

974
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,285
起来干活
Get moving.

975
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,287
我能进来吗？
Can I come in?

976
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,405
我对你不诚实
I haven't been honest with you.

977
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,131
什么意思？
What do you mean?

978
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:20,041
有些事我没有告诉你
There's things I want to tell you that I haven't told you.

979
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,845
关于什么？
What is it?

980
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,406
坎西迪先生

982
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,044
熬夜燃烧脂肪
Burning that midnight oil.

983
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,121
亚当？
Adam?

984
01:15:24,784 --> 01:15:26,368

一到第五层都断电了

我们已打开第二区安全灯

01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,402
- 只有一笔进出记录  - 是谁？

有人在研发中心密室
We've got somebody at the vault.

1007
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:44,193
（一日为贼 日日为贼）

1008
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,491
搞什么？
What the hell?

1009

乔克
Jock.

1010
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,610
坎西迪先生
Mr. Cassidy.

1011
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:22,445
人赃并获了吧？
Got caught with your hand in the cookie jar, didn't you?

1012
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,610
我… 乔克 我可以解释这一切
I... Jock, I can explain this.

1013

你打算从哪里开始？
Where you gonna start?

1014
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,291
我真的没想到
I was beginning to think it would never happen.

1015
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,687
怀特宁愿公司倒闭
Wyatt would rather watch his company crumble

1016
01:20:37,687 --> 01:20:38,890
也不肯卖给我
than sell it to me.

1017
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,811
而你则带着野心一同搅局
Then you came along with your blind ambition.

1018
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,480
我们录下了所有的会谈
We recorded it all, every conversation,

1019
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,921
你和怀特的每条信息
every text between you and Wyatt.

1020
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:54,681
你告诉尼克 让他把公司股份转卖给我
You tell Nick he'll be selling me majority shares in his company

1021
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,730
否则我就把你们互相勾结的证据交给FBI
or evidence of your collusion goes to the FBI.

1022
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,162
你操纵我
You manipulated me.

1023
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,049

Yes.

1024
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,348
明天中午萨顿俱乐部

You, Nick, and me.

1026
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:13,728
没有外人 不带律师 不带保镖

1027
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,245
让他走！
Let him out!

1028
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,329
天大的错误
Big mistake.

1029
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,644
是的
Yeah.

1030
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,083
你怎么来了 你不能呆着
What are you doing here? You can't be here.

1031
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,600
你利用我
You used me.

1032
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,445
很抱歉
I'm sorry. OK? I'm so sorry.

1033
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,285
你必须走 这里不安全
You got to go, you're not safe here.

1034
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,761
每件事…你说的每句话
Everything you... everything you said,

1035
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,295
你做的每件事…
every... everything you did...

1036
01:22:25,128 --> 01:22:26,164
都是撒谎
was a lie.

1037
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,402
不 不全是
No, that's not true. Not everything.

1038
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,042
我想出人头地
I wanted to be someone else.

1039
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,121
你成功了
Now you are.

1040
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,564
你成功了
Now you are.

1041
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,802
你知道…
You know...

1042
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,764
我爱你是因为你的与众不同
I fell for you because you weren't like everyone else.

1043
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:03,443
艾玛 我会弥补一切的
Emma, I'm gonna make this right.

1044
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,962
你根本不了解局势
You don't know what that is.

1045
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,890
你搞砸了
Well, you sure messed that up.

1046
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,644
我还在想办法 好吗？
Hey, look, I'm trying, OK?

1047
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,327
好了 你的办法完了 我们去兜风
Yeah, well, now you're done trying. Let's go for a ride.

1048
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,243
- 你什么都没有得到吧？  - 都是设计好的陷阱！
- Look, you don't get it, OK? - It was all a setup!

1049
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,970
- 上车！  - 这都是设计好的！
- Get in the car! - It was all a setup!

1050
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,485
对不起 兄弟
I'm sorry, man.

1051
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,321
道什么歉？
What are you sorry for?

1052
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,323
又不是你的撞的我
You didn't run me over, did you?

1053
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,124
都是我的错
I'm the reason for all of this.

1054
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,729
问题是…
The real question is...

1055
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,242
…接下来我们怎么办？
...what are we gonna do about it?

1056
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,322
我会以牙还牙 我…
I'm going to use what they taught me...

1057
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,848
…摧毁他们的帝国
...to destroy what they built.

1058
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,807
和荷兰人交易进展如何？
So, what's the news on the Dutch deal?

1059
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,082
- 不知道  - 他们已经没有价值了
- I don't know. - Good, we won't need them anyway.

1060
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,088
记得没请你啊
Don't remember inviting you.

1061
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:25,091
我的离职派对会为一切画上句话
My going-away party got this whole thing rolling.

1062
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,964
这可能是我在你们面前最后一次露面
I thought it was only fair that I show up for yours.

1063
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,729
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

1064
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,087
戈达策划了所有这一切…
Goddard orchestrated this whole thing...

1065
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,968
…诱导你陷入犯罪泥沼
...to entrap you into committing a crime.

1066
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,684
我没有犯罪
I didn't commit a crime.

1067
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,366
是你做的
You did.

1068
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,083
你的帝国就要毁灭了
This is the death of your empire, Nick.

1069
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,971
给你的钱与我无关
And you were funded with money I never touched,

1070
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,559
是一家我从未听过的公司经手的
by corporations I had never heard of.

1071
01:25:56,559 --> 01:25:57,522
那家公司一分不值
He has nothing.

1072
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:59,523
你错了 他掌控一切
He has everything.

1073
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,144
电邮 短信
E-mails, texts.

1074
01:26:01,144 --> 01:26:03,890
还破解了摄像头

1075

所有的线索都指向你
All the dots connect back to you.

1076
01:26:06,213 --> 01:26:07,411
整个事情都是设计好的
The whole thing was a setup.

1077
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,050
怎么回事？怎么回事？
What's going on? What's going on?

1078
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,224
我们自有周详！
We had good intel on this!

1079
01:26:11,224 --> 01:26:13,808
你何谈周详 尼克？
Where did you get that intel, Nick?

1080
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,770
别荒谬了
This is absurd.

1081
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,850
你不能…
You can't just...

1082
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,081
汉米尔顿
Hamilton.

1083

乔克的老家
Jack's hometown.

1084
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,006
尼克…
Nick...

1085
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:14,846
米彻姆
Meachum.

1086
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:31,844
解决一个
That's one down.

1087
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,240
还有一个
One more to go.

1088
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,808
不管你用什么招 最好管用
Whatever you have better be good.

1089
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:50,088
如果奏效 我们都撤退比较保险
If it works, we both walk away with an insurance policy

1090
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,123
再多的钱都也买不来
no amount of money can buy.

1091
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,567
万一不奏效呢？
Yeah, but if it doesn't?

1092
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,363
拿出手机 请坐
Get out your phones. Sit down.

1093
01:28:12,363 --> 01:28:14,246
扣出电池放在桌上
Put the batteries on the table.

1094
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,242
它说你有备机
It says you've got another phone.

1095
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,727
- 不 不  - 怎么了？
- Oh, no, no. - What happened?

1096
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,325
信号丢失 两部都没了
I lost the signal. Both phones, they're gone.

1097
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:14,641
能找回来吗？
Can you get it back?

1098
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:24,687
- 你必须出价  - 我会付钱的
- You'll pay for this. - Yeah, I'll pay.

1099
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:30,644
我买下你怀特公司该死的全部股权
I'm buying every goddamn share of Wyatt Corporation's stock you own,

1100
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:33,161
只需40%的钱
and I'm paying 40 cents on the dollar.

1101
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,285
意下如何？
How does that sound?

1102
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,722
即便我不收购你 联邦政府也会收购你
I get it or the Feds do.

1103
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:48,201
- 你不会得逞的  - 闭嘴 亚当
- You'll never get away with this. - Shut up, Adam.

1104
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,882
你不过是个方便的工具 绣花枕头
You're nothing but a convenient tool, an empty vessel.

1105
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:53,326
我塞你一嘴屎尿
I filled you with piss and vinegar

1106
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:57,007
告诉你这是香槟 你一样舔得干干净净
and told you it was champagne and you lapped it up.

1107
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,406
- 我不会签字的  - 那你等着坐牢
- I'm not signing this. - Then you'll go to jail.

1108
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:05,684
凭什么？ 你有什么王牌？！
With what? What have you got?!

1109
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:12,127
什么？
What?

1110
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:14,965
- 赶紧签！  - 你已经很得势了
- Sign it! - You have taken credit for everything.

1111
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,272
你什么都没有创造过！
And you've created nothing!

1112
01:30:17,272 --> 01:30:18,886
你这个自大的混蛋！
You arrogant bastard!

1113
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:22,245
我把一件被众人耻笑的砖头设备…
I took a brick device that everybody laughed at

1114
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:26,246
最终变成人类寸步不离的宝贝
and turned it into the one thing that no one can do without.

1115
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:28,169
我的自大是我自己挣来的！
I earned my arrogance!

1116
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,784
是的！但没有我什么都不会发生
Yes, and none of that happens without me!

1117
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,285
你是站在我肩膀上！
You stood on my shoulders!

1118
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,568
现在我站在你的脖子上！
And now I'm standing on your neck!

1119
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:38,611
我始终比你棋高一着 尼克
I'm 15 moves ahead of you, Nick.

1120
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:41,286
荷兰人也给我报价了！
The Dutch offer, me!

1121
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:45,446
我一直没能收紧圈套 直到…
I strung you along until the only hope was...

1122
01:30:45,612 --> 01:30:46,731
亚当的出现
Adam.

1123
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:52,283
这不可能
That's impossible.

1124
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:53,885
不可能？
Impossible?

1125
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:57,010
我建立了怀特公司
I built Wyatt Corp.

1126
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:00,767
卖不卖 你的公司都完蛋了
Sell or not, your company is finished.

1127
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:03,969
你没有稻草绳可抓了 即便有
You've got nothing in the pipe, and even if you did,

1128
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:07,488
你也没有资金投放市场
you've got no money to market it with.

1129
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:11,281
40%的股份 总比坐牢好吧
Forty cents on the dollar is a lot better than jail.

1130
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:12,845
你自行决定
You make the choice.

1131
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,326
现在滚
Now get out.

1132
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,403
他喜欢干掉自己的年轻一辈
He likes to eat his young.

1133
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,489
那也是我的自由
They're mine to eat.

1134
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,411
该回去过你原本的悲惨生活了
It's time to go back to your sad little life.

1135
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,531
何必大费周章？
Why go to all the trouble?

1136
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:15,571
因为我想看到他头破血流 你走吧
Because I wanted to see him bleed. Go.

1137
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:16,729
不 远非如此
No. There's more to it,

1138
01:32:16,729 --> 01:32:18,371
你没必要出此险招的
you wouldn't risk it all just for that.

1139
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,128
我说过 亚当
I told you, Adam,

1140
01:32:20,128 --> 01:32:22,809
竞争激发创新
competition breeds innovation.

1141
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,361
他在公司混得有模有样后 私欲膨胀
With his name on the door, he developed his ass off.

1142
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,369
你需要他
You needed him.

1143
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:29,722
你需要他的创造力 因为他比你聪明
You needed his mind because he was smarter than you.

1144
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,526
他把一片伟大的处理器用在一部屎样的手机上
He made a great processor and a shitty phone

1145
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:35,524
他该落得和你一样的下场 走吧
and he served a purpose, just like you did. Go.

1146
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,004
没有他你什么都干不了
You're nothing without him.

1147
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,723
Occura是真的 我说到做到
Occura is real. It'll do everything I said it would.

1148
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,688
我不过是需要他的处理器而已
I just needed his processor to run it.

1149
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,289
- 谁？  - 戈达先生？
- Who is this? - Mr. Goddard?

1150
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,329
是谁？
Who is this?

1151
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,000
你真应该彻底删除你收到的电邮
You should really trash your e-mails when you're done reading them.

1152
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,090
早上我给所有人发了邮件
I sent you all an e-mail this morning

1153
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:16,124
内含类3DPS身份鉴别数据
in which I encoded 3DPS-like data to identify you.

1154
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,762
有人一直在偷听 乔克
Someone is always listening, Jock.

1155
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,445
一直
Always.

1156
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:54,681
戈达先生
Mr. Goddard.

1157
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:56,524
戈达先生 你被捕了
Mr. Goddard, you're under arrest.

1158
01:33:56,680 --> 01:34:00,207
我会让你生不如死
I'm gonna make your life a living hell.

1159
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,289
站起来 手放背后
Please stand, place your hands behind your back.

1160
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:05,608
我们逮到他了
Yes! We got him.

1161
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:10,286
你们做了一件大好事儿 孩子
You did the right thing, kid.

1162
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:12,283
现在指控你重罪欺诈
The charges against you include felony fraud,

1163
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,094
商业间谍罪
industrial espionage,

1164
01:34:14,094 --> 01:34:15,452
妨碍司法
obstruction of justice,

1165
01:34:15,452 --> 01:34:17,002
及内幕交易
insider trading.

1166
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:20,369
奥古斯丁·戈达 你有权保持沉默
Augustine Goddard, you have the right to remain silent.

1167
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:23,444
但你所说的一切都将成为呈堂证供
Anything you say can and will be used in a court of law.

1168
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:26,483
你有权请律师
You have the right to an attorney.

1169
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:28,513
如果你请不起律师
If you cannot afford an attorney,

1170
01:34:28,513 --> 01:34:30,401
法院也会为你指派一名律师
the court will appoint one for you.

1171
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,762
听懂我宣读的你的权利了？
Do you understand these rights as I have read them to you?

1172
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,922
我向FBI举报了怀特和戈达
I handed the Feds Wyatt and Goddard.

1173
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:46,286
他们将有段日子看不到阳光了
They won't be seeing light for a very long time.

1174
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:50,285
朱迪斯和米彻姆罪有应得
Judith and Meachum got what they deserved too.

1175
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:55,524
而我很幸运
As for me, I got lucky.

1176
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:58,206
因为我的合作 所以联邦调查局放我一马
The Feds cut me a break for my cooperation.

1177
01:34:58,680 --> 01:34:59,647
不…
No...

1178
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:12,088
曾经的追求现在想来其实也没那么重要
The things I thought I wanted don't seem so important anymore.

1179
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:15,685
吃一堑长一智 还有…
I do know right from wrong, and...

1180
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:20,131
…隔了这么久才能做回我自己
...I'm sorry it took me so long to act on it.

1181
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:25,009
我只想你知道
I just want you to know that

1182
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:27,401
我从不曾想对不起你
I never wanted to do any of this to you.

1183
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,402
希望有一天我能弥补一切
I hope one day I can make things right.

1184
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:39,680
对不起 艾玛
I'm sorry, Emma.

1185
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:52,966
谢谢
Thanks.

1186
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:56,842
快！快！快！快！
Go, go, go, go! Go! Go! Go!

1187
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:58,923
快跑 快跑！
Run, run!

1188
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,567
干嘛？
What?

1189
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:12,411
我有说你是对的吗？
Did I ever tell you, you were right?

1190
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,125
关于什么？
About what?

1191
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:17,491
一切
Everything.

1192
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:23,244
真心的
I mean that.

1193
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,289
抱歉我以前没有听你的
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.

1194
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,083
和那女孩发展的怎么样了？
How's it going with that girl?

1195
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,971
她不愿意和我说话
Well, she won't talk to me.

1196
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:50,762
塞翁失马焉知非福
It ain't over till it's over.

1197
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:55,561
知道我约你妈出来约了多久吗？
You know how long it took me to get a date with your mother?

1198
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:57,760
多久？
How long?

1199
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:02,762
花儿都谢了
A long time.

1200
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,123
我那时比你现在还帅
And I was much better-looking then than you are now.

1201
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:11,090
- 真的吗？  - 噢耶
- Oh, is that right? - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1202
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:22,489
你去哪儿？地铁在这边
Where you going? The subway is this way.

1203
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:24,927
我有更快的交通工具 过来
I got a faster ride. Come on.

1204
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,683
我以为这事情已经了结了呢？
I thought we were done with this shit?

1205
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,808
租的啦 老爸 我租了一天
It's a rental, Dad. I got it for the day.

1206
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:38,964
哦 真的吗？好啦 让我们找点乐子去
Oh, yeah? Well, then, let's have some fun.

1207
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:42,845
不迷失自己的方法就是…
One way to remember who you are...

1208
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,407
咋开门的？
How do you open this thing?

1209
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:47,847
树立正确的英雄榜样
...is to remember who your heroes are.

1210
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,283
我现在自己干
I'm doing things my way now.

1211
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:05,165
万丈高楼平地起
Building from the ground up.

1212
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:07,482
万事无捷径
There are no shortcuts.

1213
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:09,804
我的天呀 你在搞什么？
Oh my God, what are you doing?

1214
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:12,122
- 啥？我弄混了  - 我们有好多事儿要忙
- What? I messed it up. - We have a lot of things to do.

1215
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:13,970
- 来吧！  - 好吧 好吧！
- Come on! - All right, Jesus!

1216
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:19,120
嗨 艾玛
Hi. Emma Jennings.

1217
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,044
稍等
One second.

1218
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:25,607
亚当有客人
Adam, you have a visitor.

1219
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,365
你好
Hi.

1220
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:47,165
这地方不错
Nice place you have here.

1221
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:49,243
我意思是指在布鲁克林区
I mean, for Brooklyn.

1222
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,168
非常荣幸你能来
I'm glad you came.

1223
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:56,967
一直收到一家新公司的职位邀请电邮
Kept getting e-mails about a job offer at a brand-new startup company.

1224
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,404
为什么我没看见…
Why I didn't see that coming...

1225
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:03,723
我们…
Yeah, we, uh...

1226
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:06,281
我们真的需要你
We really need you here.

1227
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,450
你们请不起我的
You couldn't afford me.

1228
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:10,921
算你公司股份
Lots of stock options.

1229
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,082
那你得更加把劲
You have to do better than that.

1230
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,405
好
OK.

1231
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:27,921
我真的需要你
I need you here.

1232
